Neuroscience and Neurobiology Basics for Therapists 

00:00:25
ALLEN IVEY Hello, My name is Allen Ivey, welcome. 

00:00:30
MARY IVEY And my name is Mary Bradford Ivey, welcome. 

00:00:30
ALLEN IVEY Today, Mary and I are going to explore the basics of neuroscience as they are related to counseling and psychotherapy. I think these are central to our practice and basically to everyday communication. I am going to hand off to Mary after about 10 slides and then I'll be coming back later. Mary is going to… I am going to start with neuroscience basics and she is going to show you how neuroscience relates to stress. Stress, we have discovered is the essential part we have not paid enough attention to in counseling and psychotherapy. So, let's get down on our way. Okay, I bet you're surprised to see this slide with social justice in the center. Well, what I've discovered, I have worked in social justice and multicultural issues for many, many years. What I found is that by far the best evidence base that we need to think about multiculturalism and social justice is what we found in neuroscience. Neuroscience is an integrated discipline which means not only that we need in the biology and body, Neurobiology which means… I now tend to think of mind, body or body, mind they are interchangeable and together. Counseling and therapy don't pay enough attention to the interconnection. Most of my reading now is in Neurology. I follow Genetics closely. I used to be anti-genetic that use carefully and wisely genetics will actually inform and help the counseling and psychotherapy process. Biology is important in Neuroscience as are Chemistry, Physics and of course Psychology. Neuroscience impacts the way the family interacts. Neuroscience impacts total communities. Multiculturally, neuroscience is different among different cultures. The brain works differently in different cultures and of course environmental context is critical. Okay, with that in mind let's continue. Here are the neuroscience basic, body, brain, stress and drugs. Our interpersonal interactions change the brain. Counseling changes the brain, psychotherapy changes the brain. In other words, it isn't just here, we also work actually literally on changes in the body. Now interpersonal reactions so anybody talking to anybody is actually get in the process of developing new neural nets. Possibly even new neural neurons themselves. I do want to read this one to you because I think it's very important. It's from the, from psychiatry, but I think it speaks to us in counseling and psychotherapy. Psychotherapy needs to be re-conceptualized, re-branded, and repositioned as a neurobiological treatment because, in fact, that's what it is. This notion goes hand in hand with unimpeachable evidence that the mind is an integral component of the brain and mental illness, so called mental illness is generated from genetic or environmentally induced dysregulation of neurobiological homeostasis. I do want you to notice they're environmentally induced, a wisdom is coming up is person environment we don't necessarily, we no longer in… we must no longer put the blame, uh… the belief that the illness or the problem is in the person, it is also in interaction with the environment. So, any problem is a logical response to what happens biologically or environmentally. See that little thing down in the corner? That's called the mitochondria or mitochondrion and these are the power cells of the body, I hope this is a word that you become central in your thinking and counseling a psychotherapy because when I move my arm the mitochondria are providing what's called ATP, the energy that moves throughout our whole body is ATP that we really want to develop and encourage. If we get involved in drugs, if we get involved in an illness the ATP… the mitochondria start passing away… And then you know what? We have got counseling problems. One of our major goals in counseling is to strengthen and encourage the mitochondria. Again, counseling and psychotherapy change the brain. Keep that in mind. Okay, Sapolsky of Stanford is a hero to us, to Mary and me, and I recommend that you look him up on YouTube because he has some fantastic presentations. This is from one of presentations on depression. And I think this is important to remember, depression is a disease as diabetics. Depression is a disease as is diabetics. When we have depression, we have a stress synapse and those emotions change body functioning. In other words, it goes right to heart rate, it goes right to the way perspiration, breathes. It goes right down to the flow of hormones and neurotransmitters. Interesting to me in, and this is semi-sidetrack Anhedonia, we tend to think of depression holistically, actually Sapolsky has a good point for us when we think about depression. He first of all points out Anhedonia/Apathy, no feeling, interestingly enough, chests of the… with Dopamine, Peptides, etcetera. Nothing seemed to worked really well when a person is doing this. I think this where you start talking really serious major depression. And that's time we want to start very much involving medical personnel. If it's grief and sadness, OCD and depression, we are going find that serotonin, SSRI's and other meds are helpful. And interesting enough, and I've always been an anti-med person, I find now you are going to get Neuroscience that the serotonin SSRI's actually do increase the number of neurons and neuroconnections. Nonetheless, keep in mind this CBT and other forms of therapy do the same thing. It isn't just drugs that produce neuroconnections, you produce neuroconnections. And then guilt and fear also is another type of depression. And fear by the way clearly interrelates with depression. Serotonin SSRI's help here. We also got to watch in depression for suicide, 65% of mood disorders try suicide. Original treatment for depression was Neuropinephrine MAO inhibitors and that's psychomotor retardation, slower moving. And for a patient that just has trouble moving, talks slow and so forth, these things tend to pep up the system and get moving. Now also note the biology, the brain is reacting and the body is reacting to all of this, uh… Sapolsky makes one interesting point, he says that thyroid is involved between 20% and 30% of depression. Keep in mind, (inaudible ) in depression there is always a need to think about, should be refer to and work with medical people? And at this point as I go through this Mary and I are not physicians. Uh… So, anything that involves specific change in the body I think is very important to stay in touch with the medical establishment. Uh… Also while you're depressed, you tend to eat more or less. Stress hormones can move… our biological clock, time clock gets out of the system. Depression is a disease as diabetics. And the same, this holds true for virtually all whether it's anxiety, schizophrenia, and so forth we got to think mind, body, body, mind. Okay, back to our beloved mitochondria. You heard about oxidative stress they are the one that are hurt by oxidative stress and they are related in… and all mental and physical disorder. They provide 95% of our body's energy and many, many in the brain because our brain is a high energy person. They are little cells within the cells, micros, very small cells within cell of the body. Some cells contained many mitochondria in them and they have their own DNA. Dysfunction is clearly (inaudible ) research associated with depression, bi-polar issues, schizophrenia as well as neurobiological diseases, as well as Parkinson's, ALS and Dementia. Now, so we want to build those mitochondria, we build them with exercise. Exercise has now become one of our main treatments and in another series we call Therapeutic Life Changes we point out that exercise is the central issue in mental health. John Ready of Harvard Med School points out that any physician that does not prescribe exercise as a part of the treatment is unethical. What does this say to us as counselors and therapists? It says we need to check out and encourage exercise in our clients. Some research, some empirical research has found that an exercise program can do as… from mild to moderate depression can do as much good is medications. And mitochondria, get involved with cell apotosis and death. Stress management becomes essential because stress, stress, stress, stress is what impacts our friends, the mitochondria. Okay, this is what got me excited about Neuroscience. It got me passionate about it and I literally did the first presentation on neuroscience with virtually nothing happening in the field. Actually literally 13 years ago, maybe even more and that's brain plasticity which now is probably familiar to most of us. When I was in the school, I learned that I was only going to lose neurons and neuronetworks as I aged. What got me enthused is that, hey, I am going to generate new neurons, new neural nets, and that became very exciting to me because I realized that is incredible implications for counseling. Our old idea of neurospan is neural loss. The new idea is lifespan plasticity and growth with new neural networks and you, I are very important in this process as is social justice. If you are oppressed and involved in, uh… let's say you are living in Detroit and you see multiple shootings, that's going to damage neural plasticity permanently. Negative plasticity from stress produces Cortisol remember that word Cortisol. Can be damaging, that produces illness, produces loss, depression produces loss, poverty produces loss, diet can really tear things apart. You are what you eat to a great extent, increasingly the research is showing diet is really central and if you are poor you are chances are of having a good diet are not nearly as good. So, the issues of diet need to be considered as well. All of this produce negative plasticity. If you notice up in the top left, you see the sprouting (inaudible ) the neuron. In the other hand if you get injury, depression, etcetera, you are going to see the sprouting doesn't occur and you start to see the death of the neuron and ultimately the death of the mitochondria. This one is a critical one for social justice and here we see that the total gray matter changes depending on socioeconomic status. And this again is neuroscience data verified solid and empirical evidence that we need to think about social justice in the counseling and therapy process. Notice that the high, middle and low socioeconomic start about the same place, but with enrichment, money and so forth by 37 months we can see that the high socioeconomic people have got a large advantage in terms of gray matter volume over middle and low socioeconomic status. Again, this is the issue of brain plasticity played out in social justice multicultural issues. Stimulation and enrichment is very difficult if you don't have enough money and enough resources, and you go to poor schools. So, action beyond the interview can be important, stimulation is really critical to help these lower socioeconomic kids develop. This is what mentoring, involvement, changes in the school become important. And I hope that you don't get stuck on just counseling and psychotherapy. You start looking at what can you do to see that young people have more opportunity. Mirror neurons, the second thing that I got excited about. I got that excited about literally, empathy. Rogers taught us very well that Empathy is central. We know this now 30% of successes in counseling and psychotherapy and now we have specific evidence that motor neurons actually are the physical basis of empathy. Can you imagine something as mental as empathy is physical? Our motor neurons up here fire won't be observed somewhere else. Think about yourself in a movie and there is violence and second thing you notice your hands are tight and you get excited and so forth. Or maybe you are watching a moving movie you feel tears come in your eyes you feel sad. These are your mirror neurons representing empathy. Sports, you do this excitement or lively like football it's moving and action. And we can also think about how aboriginal kids learned the boomerang. They watched their parents throw a boomerang, throw boomerangs, throw boomerangs and then they did it. Observation learning Albert Bandura is really kiddy(ph) what the person sees is what they learn. Another one in terms… in terms of counseling, when one member of a couple is shot, the pain neurons of course fire in the shot person, but there is also neurons which basically provide a cognitive understanding of pain. Well, if I am watching Mary get shot, uh… she is got both of those firing, but you know what happens to me? My observational neurons are firing because I feel her pain in my body. Isn't just in my mind, it's in my body. And I don't like to see Mary get hurt and so I care very much for her so that's basically is body, mind empathy. 8% of the population have what they call alexithymia, they can't see self and observe other people's pain. They have less prefrontal activation, less going on in the anterior cingulate cortex and the cerebellum. Most conduct disorders and sociopaths and even, sad to say, 41% of Vietnam vets have alexithymia because they're not quite so sensitive to the pain of others. And that's one way to survive in the world if you have been abused. Many sociopaths, conduct disorder kids have been abused and raised in poverty situations etcetera. Vietnam vets, others veterans have gone through trauma. So, once you've gone through that, you learned you have to defend yourself and your mirror neurons don't activate as fully. And then by the way this happen in major depression, you think about a depressed person, they really don't recognize where you are. Substance abusers don't recognize you. Another study, 20 therapists client pairs were attached to an EEG machine. I imagine Mary and I tied together in here with EEGs and we are kind of… and they are looking at a video screen of our EEG. Okay, uh… if I go along and I'm empathic to you, guess what? Our mirror neurons are shown on EEG to be in parallel. And if I'm un-empathic, they fall apart. I never am empathic, am I? Never, never, never. So, that's… I am actually like three years ago… I know some years ago I was working with (inaudible ) and I told him someday we are going to have attached to the counselor and client, something like that, so we can actually see on the screen. And you are probably going to in your career have some type of connection through EEG, maybe even wirelessly and you will be able to watch points in which your client and you support each other empathically and also when you are apart. So, this is something coming in the future and mirror neurons are critical in that whole process. Counseling and therapy impact neurotransmitters, but so does cocaine, THC and so on. Neurotransmitters are where we pass dopamine, serotonin, all of those wonderful things that activate our body. Every time we talk millions, billions, I don't know the number of neurotransmitters are passing back and forth instantly. So, keep in mind, counseling changes the brain, activates neurotransmitters for good or ill. Culture and the brain, here we are back to some social justice cultural issues and the need to understand that different people come from different situations. Interestingly enough and not surprisingly in the United States, the "me" brain circuits fire independently. I, I, I ,I, that tends to be the U.S. culture and I thought generalization, but this comes from data of FMRIs examining brains. Examine the brains of Chinese people the "me" circuit, the "I" circuit fly, but the "mom" circuit, the mother circuit overlaps. In other words, a person relates to other people, not just on "I", but how do I relate to somebody else. So, in other words, the brains fire differently because of cultural experience. Interesting enough, this is controversial needless to say. Conservative brains, I won't say which people are conservative, react more negatively when they see pictures of people of color. In other words, their mirror neurons react very differently. Various other brain circuits behave differently. Conservative brains react more negatively to people of color. Which also means by the way, if you are seeing a client with who has an issue for example, it maybe that you feel they are behaving inappropriately, uh… here… even though you are trying to be empathic and understanding, the chances are the piece of you, where your brain is firing a bit differently a little less positively because you are not quite, don't like the way they are behaving, you may be conservative or you may be more liberal, either way your brain circuit is likely to be a little less empathic. And sad to say American brains fire more pictures of dominance. American brains fire more at pictures of dominance. USA, USA, USA number one, number one. Asians for most part fire more at issue pictures and issues around relationship. So, interestingly enough the "I" focus in counseling is what we do in counseling and therapy, but as we focus on I, I, I we are also missing many relationship issues. Asians use more parietal spatial part of the brain for math while American use language circuit. Probably one of the reasons we are not so often so good in math and why Asians, because culturally the Asians have tended over the centuries to use more spatial relations than we do. Your client's brain is firing differently from you. And this is one of the reasons that we need to think about motor neurons and empathy all the more, Carl Rogers was totally right, counseling is right and emphasizing relationship and empathy except Neuroscience that do it all the more. Neuroscience in terms of multi-cultural social justice issue says watch out… is you… is your brain firing like that so called conservative brain, let's call… instead of conservative brain let's say different brain, is your different brain reacting appropriately to different people. You have got to look at yourself, I have with myself, we're trained, this stuff happens automatically. Now moving on, let's take a look at the brain itself. We are going to look at the emotional system first. Here we see the limbic emotional system, think of it as the short circuit. And I will tell you why short circuit later. The technique, the word that goes with is HPA and I will relieve you by saying and I am not going to ask you to learn much about the HPA, but maybe you want to go back and look at this slide later and think about it more in detail. But one thing I think we must all know is the amygdala, that's the energizer bunny that's makes everything happen. If you see, hear, feel something, it goes to the amygdala. If there is enough long term potentiation LTP they say… or enough stimulus, the amygdala fires and then the whole brain goes. We got to think of the brain as holistic, but we have got to think of the amygdala as the driver, the energizer bunny. We also need to think about the individual as an information processing system. We are not computers, but there is some extent we all process information based on the input we have got from the past. If you send garbage into a computer, it processes garbage information. If we got garbage into our brain, I am not going to talk but how garbage gets in the brain, you are going to start outputting garbage. So, what happens on the outside determines what happens inside, person environment. And what's increasingly important to note, HPA hypothalamus links to hormones, the pituitary, the adrenal and cortisol, that's called that the HPA short circuit. Plus the thalamus serves as a relay station and the hippocampus for memory. These are all critical issues which eventually are going to be central for your vocabulary. I also suspect a good number of people have had the bio-physiology courses is familiar, but you've got the think now how does this relate because typically when we get the physiology course they don't talk about how it's gonna be practical in day-to-day work. Counseling very much affects the flow of hormones, affects the flow of neurotransmitters. If you look there at the core of this picture and you saw that those black areas and so forth, you are going to note that these limbic systems are in a more central mid brain and there one of the first reactions happen. I will talk a little more about that later. Let's move to the TAP, the long circuit, this is executive function where we make decisions also by the way where we regulate our emotions or maybe more accurately we try to regulate emotions because most of us don't always regulate them. Also by the way it's a seat of positive emotions. I neglected to say that the amygdala tends to be the center of the negative emotions. We talk about sad, mad, glad, fear, etcetera, those more negative emotions are more associated with the limbic system. Why? Because they are protective. But they get so protective that we really need to also watch out for impulse control, so forth. The positive emotions in the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala again, activates. But start thinking about it, look at the core of the brain, the prefrontal cortex here is somewhat distant from the basic emotions and basic driver of the brain. So, it's a little behind and we'll illustrate that in a little more detail later. There we have still the thalamus for relay and attention, the ACC and the PFC and again, the hippocampus. Also interesting is this nucleus accumbens, pleasure center for dopamine real critically important when it comes to drugs and times of pleasure. So, in that frame here is a stress response system. And we have the PFC again, the ACC, central to executive decision and decision making. You're doing decisional counseling, you are doing CBT, you're primarily working with the PFC and as (inaudible ) says, if you can think good thoughts, the rest of the brain, the rest of the body will follow, thoughts can lead to action. It's also the PFC is critical for emotional regulation and control, the ideas control the limbic system as equally important to executive functioning and decision making. But the limbic system often overrides and that our cognitive thought. It overrides our decision making. You have clients with impulse control who pop off, you have people that… violence coming up in the home, you have any number of things. Just yesterday I was watching a soccer game and in the middle of it all, a wonderfully skilled Colombian guard stuck her foot out, tripped, the star was about to make a goal. Got a red card and is out for a game. What happened there? Her limbic system took over, and the defensive stuff did anything, her body did anything it could to save itself from the goal. The limbic system often takes over from the PFC that's why the emotion regulation. But sometimes, that time the limbic system tripped up not only the person that fell and wasn't injury, but she certainly was not pleased and the person who was taken out of the game. The limbic system there, the impulse control didn't work every well. On the other hand let's imagine you are driving down the road, I am sure this happened to all of you, it's happened to me. Somebody swerves towards you, boom, if you are it… you swerve away. If you wait for the PFC to make that decision, you are going to have a crash. The automatic behavior of a limbic system is very good at protecting us in a situation such as this, it's very alert and very quick and so we got to treasure that limbic system, evolutionary, the fear is a very important emotion, not a bad emotion. We need to have fear because we need to protect ourselves. The whole system is there, a PFC emotion, and the limbic system. You think about this particular one, the adrenals… and all this by the way, the bottom down is an immune system. Stress goes down to the immune system. Our whole body is impacted. Heart rate uh… breathing rate, blood pressure, uh… the action of the mitochondria, cytokines, the whole raft of things are impacted by stress. I also have to say though, we don't learn without stress. So, I've been talking about the dangers of stress, there also is a lot of positive things in stress. And that is if you are not stressed, you don't learn. Suppose you are sitting there, a child is sitting there in class bored and getting important information, uh… that information goes in one ear and out the other. What's important here is there's enough involvement to get the amygdala energizing, limbic system involved, get the whole body involved for them to learn. Cortisol can damage the brain, but cortisol is also necessary for learning. Stress is a necessary part of our life. Uh… The NIH, National Institute of Health has this brain initiative and think about our amazing brain 2-4 pounds that take 25% of the heartbeat's blood. This is a DTI image and note that the PFC again, is distant from the limbic system. The limbic system it would be represented by the green area in the center and the… and the purple as well. Notice that stimulus comes in, it's going to go first to the amygdala and the limbic system and take a longer time to get to the PFC. And so therefore, the PFC in red, executive functioning and emotional regulation, the limbic for perfection. The term for this is Connectome and what's happening now is we are now mapping all the connections in the brain and this is a massive project, it's going to take about 10 years, Sebastian Seung at MIT basically initiated this book. He's got a very good book on the Connectome which will give some sense of how the important of connections in the brain are. And keep in mind as you activate neuroconnections, you are also strengthening, uh… connections in different parts of the brain. Uh… I think this is my last slide and then Mary will take over for a little while. I will be back, but this up in the front is our colleague and co-author Carles Zalaquett and this picture was taken by one of his students, one of his graduate students. And basically what he's studying, moral decisions, ethical decisions. And you've basically heard this all, the HPA, limbic system reacts first without awareness. In other words this is… limbic system is kind of always operating in our unconscious. And uh… and later the TAP, the prefrontal verbalization and action come in and they may be different. What we think unconsciously maybe different than what we say. But that's a critical issue in emotional regulation. So, this is a picture of the brain. Now I want to show you if I can get this going. Okay, now watch the brain light up. This was taken with an iPhone, uh… a movie iPhone of a student working with Carles on the research project. What you are seeing here is the brain lighting up before the decision is made. Just once more. Neuroscience is actually strengthen (inaudible ) psychology and the ideas of the unconscious. The brain lights up, makes decisions before we act. Emotional regulation comes in and you may not behave like the limbic system and the background suggest you might want to. So, now it's time to have Mary take over and this is going to some really good stuff and important stuff because the stress really impacts that brain, Mary. 

00:31:05
MARY IVEY Okay, Allen has talked a lot about stress, let's continue this discussion of stress and the stress responses. First, let's look at a healthy response to stress. Let's imagine you have a poor performance review in your internship or job or your partner becomes very angry with a mistake you made or there is a minor break-in in your home. So, let's take a look at what happens. First of all, you experience acute stress and then the stress response activates and then the acute stress dissipates then relaxation response start. Now I want you to think about continued stress when someone is facing poverty, abuse, racism, this can lead to many types of physical problems, plus vulnerability to breakdown of mental health. Stress is now very high for teenagers. I am sure you all know this, this was sent to us by granddaughter Madison, she found it in a hall, a hallway in her high school. This is a fact in 2013 high school students had higher anxiety than patients in a mental institution in 1950. I have to tell you that we went to her graduation and she successfully graduated despite all the stress that teenagers have. And they certainly do have a lot of stress. Allostasis is resilient and appropriate response to stress. Now we need stress as Allen has said, sometimes even acute stress to learn and to remember something. Stress is just plain activation of the nervous system, allostasis is that balance that returns us to normal homeostasis. Here, we have active resilient adjustment to predictable and unpredictable events. And of course, chronic stressful overload over a continuous period of time makes resilience more difficult and can result in serious pathologies, both physical and mental. Now let's take a look at severe stress and stress management. First of all, we have that prolonged significant stress and we know that cortisol impacts the brain and the body and then there is distress and disorder. And we helpfully intervene with therapy and counseling. Then there is a wellness approach which prevents stress reactions and finally prevention and social justice action. And we think of prevention efforts and one of these is working in a community around issues of social justice, working to end poverty, working against discrimination of all types of women, the poor, the disabled. Counseling can be a social justice profession, but we seldom think of ourselves as having this responsibility. Later on, we are talking about our therapeutic lifestyle interventions and they are very much oriented towards prevention. Now the brain during stress what exactly is happening. Stressful experiences disengage the frontal lobes, and Allen talked about this, which overtime can lead to impulsivity, short sightedness, aggressive behavior, increased anxiety, depression, alcohol and drug abuse, learning disorders and stress related diseases. And this is exactly what happens, the executive areas disengage. We may not think straight and we make mistakes. You know what it's like when you are under stress. Then the subcortical arousal system bypasses those frontal executive functioning to prompt our stress response, and what happens? The heart rate, the heart rate continues, the breathing, we strengthen the muscle tone and the cortisol can damage the brain and we have next, the fight and flight is engaged from the amygdala. In short, stress affects the brain and whole entire body. We need stress to keep us alive and interested, but too much stress can be permanently damaging, both to the brain and to the body. Stressful experiences lead to dysfunctions of the prefrontal cortex including critical areas regulating judgment, planning, decision making, more reasoning and sense of self. Here we have a situation, HPA and the neurotransmitters teacher… teach us we cannot separate addictions from traditional therapy. In the pregnant woman here on left, and we see the dangerous of drug addiction. In the Facebook cartoon we see the dangers of a double addiction, there she is, snorting cocaine and probably addicted to Facebook too. Let's move back for a moment and look at marijuana. This I think is quite interesting, the brain's pleasure chemical Anandamide is on the left, and now note the THC, the active ingredient of marijuana has a chemical structure virtually identical to Anandamide. Thus, easily fooling the brain's receptors and entering the blood stream. Most drugs work this way. Artificial designer drugs such as Spice and K-2 can be 20 times more powerful than Anandamide leading to dangerous results. Research shows that 8% of teens that move into marijuana are at serious risk of psychosis. Now Allen and I both favor the legalization of marijuana to keep our prisons empty of victimless crimes, but I think as a mental health profession and psychologists, and counselors be prepared for more therapeutic issues as marijuana becomes more prominent in our society. And we especially look at those teenagers or they have not fully developed, their brain is not fully developed until ages 25. Look at the result of using cocaine as a stress manager. Look at the way the brain lights up and fires in a normal person lots of activity, 10 days after stopping cocaine abuse, look at how the brain reduces its activity. The impact of the drugs can last a very long time and then even a hundred days afterwards if you see, the brain is still not as active as a normal person. So, you know, in alcoholism and in cocaine addiction, any kind of addiction, they always say a hundred days to become normal. It takes a long time for that brain to return to normal like the brain on the top slide there. Another example of why our field needs to be more aware of drugs is that research there understands the brains. This slide particularly is interesting. Note the inactivity of the brain as it appears to be quite similar to the brain of a person with major depression. You can see the normal brain and you can see the depressed brain, very similar to that person who has been on drugs for a period of time, very similar, look at the slides there. In summary, let us look at this study. 1,114 illegal drug users, of those illegal drugs users 21% had mood disorder, 12% anxiety and 46% comorbid. So, in conclusion, integrated mental health and substance abuse programs could prove effective in addressing their treatment needs. It's no longer necessary to separate drug treatment from psychotherapy. Drugs increase the danger of psychosis in unmyelinated youth. 

00:38:15
ALLEN IVEY Picking up just a bit from Mary on that word myelination and that is white matter in the brain which develops overtime. Teenagers are still very much in the process of myelinating the brain. And actually full myelination doesn't happen until about age 25, that's when… And that means their impulse control is not nearly as set and for the reason probably we send kids to war, and because they don't really think they are going to be killed. Myelination is very important in judgment. So, youth are more inclined to say, well, what's happening now and planning for the future little more difficult for them because a lack of myelination. And also important to point out the stress impacts the immune system. Hypertension, you kind of got this message, you know, cholesterol build-up. They all impact the immune system. Stress increases with smoking, drinking, poor diet, lack of exercise and sleep, limited socialization. Think about health, smoking, no. Drinking, watch the amount. Diet, are you eating well? Are you getting exercise? Are you getting sleep? Are you interacting with other people? This is really critical for a healthy diet and to reduce inflammation. This also leads to changes in gene expression, can also ultimately lead to cancer, heart, depression, bi-polar, etcetera. Uh… Watson who was one of the discoverers of DNA pointed out that 30% of cancer can be prevented by exercise, diet is next of importance. If you are obese, the chances for inflame in immune system is greatly heightened and early mortality, etcetera. Uh… We are getting close to the end and I got to just mention briefly, not only do we get the heart, etcetera, I just want to introduce you to, it's only become hot very recently, the microbiota-gut-brain-axis. Our gut has hundred million neurons. We need to think of our gut now as our second brain. There are 40 neurotransmitters in the gut, 50% of dopamine, dopamine comes from brain, but also comes from, uh… the gut, the microbiota. 90% of the serotonin and the vagus nerve and the spinal cord connect the brain and the gut. So, we got to start thinking about not just brain, neurotransmitters and hormones, we now have to add the gut. And again, throughout all of these the power and motor of the mitochondria remains important. Out of this, the spleen, uh… marrow system, thymus, lymph system are obviously very important. I'll cut this short and say we also have to be aware that we are working with the total body, brain, gut and the body mind. To summarize, we really have what could be called a stress cascade. We have neurotransmitters react with the HPA axis produce glucocorticoids, hormones impact heart rate, breathing, blood pressure, damage to the brain and enlargement of the amygdala. The amygdala gets larger, it's more sensitive to fear and danger. We get inflammation of the immune system, the bone marrow, T&B cells, the spleen, thymus, lymph are hurt. Cytokines come in, mitochondria are damaged and (inaudible ) ultimately be the stress, stress will change our DNA and lead to epigenetic change. Stress will ultimately… can ultimately lead to DNA change which is interestingly or sadly transmittal… transmitted to one or two generations beyond. How permanent are these DNA changes are from stress is yet to be determined. But it is beginning to look more and more like these DNA changes from stress can become permanently embedded in an individual, the grandchildren etcetera. And ultimately enough stress in the culture can be embedded for a long time. So what can we do? Listening changes the brain, if we listen to our clients, we are actively listening, we're right back to that very first slide. We can change the brain. Therapy changes the brain. Therapeutic lifestyle changes the brain and the body. Listening changes the brain and the body. Therapy changes the brain and the body, exercise, diet, sleep, cognitive challenge, socialization, meditation, helping others. Interestingly enough, helping others has increasingly shown to increase, uh… cognitive functioning. And taking any number of studies now are starting to show, not any number, studies are starting to show that helping others actually produces, increases in gray matter, increases in cognitive function. And if we only think I, I, I, uh… we are going to be limiting ourselves. Uh… One thing I am going to suggest is, just a final statement is, I recommend having a picture of the brain body available for clients to see. And I think you'll find, this will help to their compliance with your suggestions and ideas for transfer and generalization on behavior from the interview. As we close, exercise, exercise, exercise, exercise is what's going to be an important difference. Keep the therapy going, but make exercise, consider diet, consider what's going on in the total body as part of your practice. You will make a bigger difference. Thanks for listening.
