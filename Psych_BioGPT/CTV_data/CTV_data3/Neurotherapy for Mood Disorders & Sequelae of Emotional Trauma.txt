PAUL SWINGLE The treatment of trauma, it is… something that we are doing in atleast 50% of the people that come through our door. And again if you remember the statistics from Basile uh… 50 to 60% of children and below age of 17 have been exposed to a severe, a traumatic level, a potentially traumatic level of emotional stress. So it's no shortage. 

00:00:35

00:00:40
PAUL SWINGLE I find that neurotherapy combined with some other supportive therapies is the most efficient psychotherapy on the planet, particularly if we can get the trauma to release in sleep, in REM sleep. REM is when the brain is supposed to do all of that work. And those are those crazy metaphoric dreams that every once in a while you recall and that you kind of see a pattern but the, it seems, you know, pretty chaotic. That's the brain doing it's own, it's own psychotherapy, that's what REM is all about. And we pay a lot of attention to trauma release and we've discovered a way of, of feeling that because the brain tells us that it is putting out a lot of energy to suppress the energy associated with trauma, that's what the markers mean. Now there's also a lot of things that you have to pay attention to in terms of family, relationships and self worth. And we have procedures such as, what, what, what I call a healing circle, which is a, a home therapeutic process of just sharing information that we find extremely efficient for uh… dealing with families that have been exposed to traumatic stress, families with adopted children, the healing circle just works miracles. The other thing is uh… often it is an issue associated with connectivity between couples. For example, when one of them has a trauma history, and we can actually do Neurotherapy on a couple treating their two brains as if it's one. Now, DEJ… is a differential amplifier. So what you have, you have three leads, you have a reference typically goes on the ear one mastoid. And then you have two active leads, one of them you usually reference on the other ear, and put one on the head and what you're getting in terms of the feed back is the difference between those two leads. So it is giving you the difference between the one on the head and the one on the ear. But what if I put one active lead on one person in the couple and I put the other lead on the same spot in the brain on the other person and I link their ears together so that they are grown, they are not treating two people as if it's one brain. And couple of guys have been fooling around with this, uh… less famie, Princeton and so forth, and it's very strange that I don't know whether it's just the metaphor that's doing this, but what you do is train alpha down, but the two heads, and if you are training it down it means they are coming closer together, right, differential amplifier. If it's far apart, okay. If you train up meaning you want the number to go higher, it's giving you the difference between those electrons and it's gonna be that the two brains are further apart. If you train it down it means they are closer together, okay. And if you want to fool around with this, it's a lot of fun because we have people come in, they are angry at one another and they go out holding hands. Now whether it's the metaphor 'cause I make a big deal of explaining that, okay, that where ever you go you get it gets your brains in sync, okay, which is exactly what's happening, okay. So, okay, sequelae of emotional trauma, and I showed this before there are lots of consequences associated with emotional trauma. And… risk factors associated with developing post-traumatic stress disorder. The trauma average after trauma is 8% for men 20 for women. Childhood trauma, chronic adversity, and family stressors all make it more likely that trauma is going to morph into uh… PTSD. And parental uh… trauma increases the risk for the kids to develop PTSD after exposure. And 30% of the variance presumptively of PTSD is genetic, what I think they mean by that is stress tolerance. Now the, the theta/beta ratio in the back of the brain is our marker for stress tolerance. If the theta/beta ratio is much below uh… about 1.5 and then we know stress tolerance is poor. People report more anxiety, sleep disturbance, and so forth, so one of the things that we're playing around with is what we call preparation for duty. Uh… a lot of, where I tripped over this was when I was at the Harvard and treating Vietnam vets uh… who were hospitalized. I used to sit around a schmooze with the guys who would come in and visit, the guy in, in the hospital, and one time I was sitting there and three guys had visited this hospitalized fellow, every one of them had experience exactly the same event. One of them didn't want to talk about it, the other said I went through a period of, you know, depression but came out of it. Another one said I lost some sleep but I think, you know, I'll never forget it etc. but why one guy disabled, the same event. What we find is without exception they have a marker for that and that's a severe deficiency of the theta/beta ratio in (inaudible ) region in the brain. So, uh…the assumption is why do the treatment on the in the backend, why not do the treatment on the front end. So that you increase their stress tolerance, increase that theta/beta ratio as part of their training, police force for example. So that the traumatic stress is less likely to provoke PTSD like symptom, okay. And I struggled with that in terms of military and because I think, you know, maybe I should do something else besides make our warriors you know more warrior like but, you know, it's another issue. Okay, the interesting thing, uh… there it is the blunted alpha which I'll be showing you which is the marker for PTSD uh… for the brain putting out a lot of energy to keep the lid on the emotional properties of the traumatic event. If you look at cortisol and, cortisol should look something like this, that is you fill up your gas tank in the morning and it dissipates over the course of the day. And when you are at the end of the day this is mean by the way, at the end of the day you're pretty spent because, you know, your guest tank's very close to empty. When you get these blips in cortisol at other times during the day, you know, the whole body is reacting to the traumatic event. Now, the uh… Traumatic Stress, post match stress disorder influences virtually everything if you look at this, uh… it is affecting uh… Arthritic conditions, Cardiovascular of course, and Gastrointestinal certainly. So there's a lot of uh… consequences associated with this condition when left untreated. Uh… you're 80% more likely to have one or more mental disorders if you have the symptoms of PTSD, okay, so there's a lot of comorbidity associated with that. 

00:10:15
[sil.] 

00:10:20
PAUL SWINGLE Okay, and this is the genetic marker associated with uh… the incidence of, of PTSD. And choosing does have a genetic component to it, but I think basically that has to do with the stress tolerance. I think that's the, the major issue here. Okay, this is the one I showed you before uh… why and, there's, using a normative database is not appropriate in a clinical setting because what you have in a normative database of people who have predispositions that haven't manifested. And this is the data that I was telling you about uh… in this was quite a large uh… study in which 61% percent of the teens had at least one potentially traumatic uh… emotional event. So, and paying attention to trauma makes a lot of sense. 

00:11:35
[sil.] 

00:11:40
PAUL SWINGLE And we saw this before, this is a nice healthy spectrum, okay. Oops! And what we have here is the inverse relationship between uh… amplitude and frequency. Now, and this is an alpha response this is being measured in the back of the head, PZ or O1, and what you're going to be seeing here is eyes open, eyes closed and eyes open and watch the alpha. 

00:12:15
[sil.] 

00:12:20
PAUL SWINGLE Okay, so there's our, our algorithm relationship and Alpha is sitting right in here and when she closes her eyes you'll see it, jump. And then when she opens her eyes it'll drop like a rock. So there, still her eyes closed. 

00:12:40
[sil.] 

00:12:55
PAUL SWINGLE And eyes open, okay? Nice healthy Alpha response. Now, none of the normative databases do that, they give you an eyes open and eyes closed, but they don't give you a dynamic looking at the Alpha response. So the way they administer it it's blind to trauma. Excuse me, however, the uh… brain master in a couple of the other companies are building in an algorithm in terms of their full queue. EEG is to be able to extract the clinical queue from it. Okay, now, this is trauma, this is what it looks like and again watch the uh… the Alpha. Another first thing you might notice is that doesn't look as healthy as the other one does it. You don't have that robust algorithm. And… what you're going to see is when the eyes are closed it comes up and it just can't sustain itself, so there's your trauma right there. 

00:14:10
[sil.] 

00:14:25
PAUL SWINGLE Okay, so you can see that you can eyeball it and of course we have stats that pick it up. Now, what about a traumatized artist? I treat a lot of artists with artist block. And inevitably they have a trauma marker. But artist have very strong resonant alpha, so it's very large. You can see it if you watch the right signal. And I'll show you what a traumatized artist looks like. 

00:15:10
[sil.] 

00:15:35
PAUL SWINGLE So they can't sustain it. Now here's where you have to have either a nice algorithm to extract that or look at the right signal because you know, a periodic bounces in alpha, it will give you a false reading in terms of, you know, being above 30% for example. But if you look at the right(ph) signal. It's on then, you know, it's immediately obvious that he can't, the person can't sustain it. 

00:16:05
[sil.] 

00:16:10
PAUL SWINGLE Okay, so uh… what I wanted to do was demonstrate this and I umm… had individual in which I took the, the alpha response of eyes open, eyes closed, eyes open. Then you wait a period of time and then you do it again, eyes open, eyes closed, eyes open. When you do that the second reading is almost always larger than the first. Person knows what you're doing in sunch a…. Okay, so what we did it was measured the alpha response then show them a picture and then take the alpha response again. So this is a picture of a relatively pleasant scene of a farmer with a horse in this field. Now I degraded the quality of this picture so that the quality of the picture is very similar in tone, grey tone to the one I'm going to show you now which is disturbing by the way, uh… this is from a concentration camp so if you don't want to look at it close your eyes. Okay, this is the picture that we showed on the negative side, and here the data. And this is the percent change in the Alpha response, this is where the second one is stronger than the first as I said, he is with the positive picture. So it is uh… Potentiating the alpha response, just the visualization, you know, the remembering of the uh… the picture. And here is the negative, here is the concentration camp, so Alpha is very sensitive to the emotional properties, the valence of what a person is the dealing with. And here's where we measured the two responses uh… at C.Z, Top of the head, and the back of the brain. And as I said earlier I have the feeling that when you see it in this location it's contemporary uh… had happened recently or it's just still going on, and this tends to be more historical. Again I don't have a lot of data on that, that's just a clinical observation and from our perspective doesn't matter anyway you just fix it, no matter what it was. Okay, now this is what trauma release looks like when you're actually treating somebody and here we're using brain driving. To try, to release the trauma and what we're doing is we're driving Alpha. And here's where we're driving it, and it comes up, comes up, comes up and releases and here is your, you know, engagement of data processing. Uh… and then the alpha drops down again. Okay, and then starts the build up that's what we mean by trauma release. In individuals almost always have an emotional reaction when you do that. There are other ways of doing this. And for any of you who are familiar with massage therapy and know massage therapies, you know, that will bury you often, they will be working on somebody and the person will have severe emotional reaction to what they're doing. And the reason for that is they release the body related trauma by moving the body around. Uh… the, we used to run into this before we were able to do neurotherapy and when we used to do relaxation with clients, and you would have a situation in which when you were doing a relaxation exercise with a client, they would become very anxious. And, you know, what's this all about, what it is about is (inaudible ) you only see ripples in the compound. So when you're quiet and that elevates the possibility of trauma release which is very positive. The most critical thing with trauma release is the let it happen. And if you can let it happen, it's the most efficient psychotherapy on the planet, because it has a very short life. And if you let it happen, it dissipates and you recognize that you have the feeling of okay, I'm not going to go crazy, I had the release and that's the end of it. Lot of people have a lot of difficulty with allowing it that happen of course. Now, one of the examples I give clients is a person who has a fear of public speaking for example, and does everything possible to avoid speaking in public, but there's a situation in which they can avoid it. Now what does the person do say two weeks out, well, you know, anticipating this situation which you're going to have to get up in front of a group and be panicking and so forth. Well, what they do is they practice an inefficient coping mechanism, so when they think about I'm going to be talking in two weeks and they get all, you know, jumping in the stomach and so forth what do they do, they distract themselves, okay, they wouldn't think about it. Well, when they're standing in, in the podium in front of a group they can't do that, so they're practicing a totally inefficient mechanism for dealing with their, their uh… public speaking phobia. What they should do is try to make it as strong as possible when it comes in that two week period, because what they're going to learn is that it has a life. And if they allow it happen they will come out the other side and they can practice, they can use that coping mechanism when they're actually up in front of a group, okay. Because when they're letting it happen the only thing the audience thinks they're doing is thinking. 

00:22:30
[sil.] 

00:22:35
PAUL SWINGLE This is a letter from one of the traumatized artists, that I turned her into an addict that you can see. Uh… she talks about the, now there's nothing else she wants to do or she does is stand around and paint. But that's one of her, her paintings. 

00:23:05
[sil.] 

00:23:10
PAUL SWINGLE People wonder about this, it's hanging on my wall, it's a 25 cent piece and some of them said what that the first quarter you made, when I was a little kid, you know, when I was at McLean Hospital Harvard(ph). Uh… this was a hospitalized artist. He stared at a blank canvas for two years and became suicidal and he walked into my office and said I'll never paint again and I bet him a quarter he would. And he framed that for me. See the problem with trauma is it's a blunting away from that's associated with creativity, the alpha wave, the visualization wave. It affects your ability to retain information, so short term memory is affected by trauma because it's blunting the transfers. 

00:24:15
[sil.] 

00:24:20
PAUL SWINGLE Okay, so this is depression without trauma. And the depression again is the imbalance in the front part of the brain where the right is more active than the left, and here the trauma markers or I should say the alpha response marker's and there's no problem there that's above 30% here and it's a both 50% here. With trauma there is your trauma marker, so it's sitting at I can't that 5% or something like that. And sometimes in the combat veterans where severe posttraumatic stress disorder so it's actually negative, it goes negative. Okay, so here we have the uh… imbalance in the front part of the brain and the trauma markers. 

00:25:15
[sil.] 

00:25:20
PAUL SWINGLE And we also have conditions that we call trauma based uh… depression where there's no marker for any inequality in the frontal cortex. It's simply the uh… the emotional properties associated with the traumatic exposure. Now the point is without assessing the brain you don't know what you're doing in terms of trying to handle a situation in which a person says I'm depressed for example. So one size fits all makes no sense whatsoever. And there are very specific ways of going about our altering mood states and basically it's bound to front part of the brain, take care of stress tolerance. Now… 

00:26:10
[sil.] 

00:26:25
PAUL SWINGLE I cannot get this thing to move. There we go. Okay, this is a client again with the trauma markers. And here you can see uh… it's going negative. So that the uh… alpha is actually lower under eyes closed conditions, and it's very low in the back, very poor stress tolerance. Uh… and this person talked about having depression which he does, there's your, your marker for depressed mood state. Uh… and excuse me, the trauma marker very poor stress tolerance and what he reports is panic, sleep problems, and depression, Okay. And all of that's very nicely shown in the, the brain assessment. Okay, recent triggered depression, this was a young child. Uh… no, no, this is the other one, Okay. He experienced somebody die in front of him and again there's your trauma marker. 

00:27:40
[sil.] 

00:27:45
PAUL SWINGLE And this is the other thing I wanted to show you in which alpha in the front part of the brain is lower than the beta or close to or lower than the beta, that's a mark of a hyper vigilance, and you see that very often with people who have trauma, exposure. We uh… brain mapped two uh… aboriginal communities. We had 45 people in one in 25 or 30 in the other. 90% share trauma markers. And these are two independent results by the way. And about 90% show the marker for poor stress tolerance, deficient Alpha, I'm sorry deficient theta/beta ratio in the back of the brain. Now, that makes sense if you are a hunting gathering community. And you want to go get lunch not be lunch. Okay, you don't want to ever sit down, you don't ever want to not be vigilant Okay. The problem is in the present culture it's a disadvantage, okay, there's no application for that wave form. So uh… a lot of this has to do with, you know, what kinds of occupations may be appropriate, in terms of making use of what is an advantage in some environments been not advantage in others. 

00:29:30
[sil.] 

00:29:40
PAUL SWINGLE Okay, uh… this is just showing you different kinds of situations in which you have endogenous depression or reactive depression with trauma. Now this is a situation, in which you have to find out what the nature of the trauma is, so for example, if somebody came in like this and their spouse just died, then I typically don't do any neurotherapy until you go through the grievance process. Because this is rather like if you medicate a reactive depression, you have a depression forever. And you have a problem for life, and there's some interesting research coming out on that now in terms of medication takes a acute situation and turns it into a chronic one. And a lot of the data coming out of various countries in terms of increase in trauma and chronic mental conditions associated with medication, so a very interesting data. You know, I'm very cautious about not blowing something away that shouldn't be blown away, so if somebody comes in, reactive depression, you know, my relative died, well, yeah, we'll do some conventional therapy to help you work through that in a inefficient fashion but we're not going to blow it away. 

00:31:20
[sil.] 

00:31:25
PAUL SWINGLE Okay, so sleep, hard to be happy, uh… always uh… carry that, getting anxious. Okay, so again uh… you can pick up all of these things in terms of what the brain is telling you uh… in terms of uh… what's being triggered, what's being manifested. 

00:32:00
[sil.] 

00:32:10
PAUL SWINGLE Now, remember I was talking about the anterior singular sitting right in this region here, this becomes very important what we're dealing with traumatic stress, because that is again persevered of thought processes. And you get something on your mind you can't get it out, so there's a sequence in terms of how you do these things. The first thing that I would do in treating this person is take care of that, so that there's more flexibility, less perseverant, perseverant thought, uh… take care of the frontal cortex so that the individual is able to process the information more efficiently and then release the trauma. Now and we also do a procedure referred to as cranial sacral therapy and the process of trauma release is called somato emotional release and what you're doing is you're, uh… I work with a uh… one of my technicians and they're monitoring the cranial sacral rhythm, and I am moving the body around. And when the rhythm stops you hang out there because often that's a body resonant trauma and people have pretty profound emotional reactions to that. And that's what the massage therapists are talking, about every once in a while they, you know, they move a person's arm, when the person breaks down or starts screaming. 

00:33:40
[sil.] 

00:33:45
PAUL SWINGLE Now I mentioned this earlier pseudoseizure. Uh… the, the, the brain activity associated with pseudoseizure is always traumatic stress. Hence what happens is the seizure is the person's way of, of coping with that severe emotionality that is coming up from the trauma. Now post-traumatic stress disorder, I mean the genuine article and this is another condition which everybody ion their grandmother has that label. But in bonafide PTSD with flashbacks the person is actually back in the situation, that re-living the situation, and I've been punched and all kinds of things, but they're not punching me they're punching their brother or somebody, father in this case. Uh… Pseudo seizure is in place of the flashback, so rather than flashback they go into a seizure. And as a said earlier that can be something like a full blown, what looks like a full blown myoclonic seizure to things like falling into fugue states or, or fainting. 

00:35:05
[sil.] 

00:35:10
PAUL SWINGLE This is a situation, a uh… client hospitals, hospitalized client has Pseudoseizure disorder and one of the things I wanted to see is if I got a measure of arousal. Can you predict the onset of a seizure based on arousal levels, and this is selective dermal response uh… in the right and the left hand. And this is simply turning on a sound, uh… that increases arousal and as soon as the arousal goes past six micro MHOs in both hands, precipitated a seizure, replicated that again, both above six micro MHOs again precipitates a seizure. 

00:36:05
[sil.] 

00:36:10
PAUL SWINGLE Okay, and this was again what I was talking about the hypervigilance where there's a deficient alpha in the front again associated with the trauma. And we talked about this suspected bullying and the way I, I, I identified that was the child who had a trauma marker and see here what I mean, the trauma is at CZ which led me to believe it's current and not in the back of the brain and it wasn't going as you made your call. Hence, again I went over this earlier that there are very serious consequences associated with being bullied and also being a bully, in terms of psychotic episodes. 

00:37:05
[sil.] 

00:37:10
PAUL SWINGLE Okay, this is the adult sequellae of childhood bullying. And if you look at the victims and the panic disorder and, both victims and bullies, and bullies, okay, so that kind of behavior influences uh… it has very strong, a negative consequences for both the victim and the bully and it astounds me how many uh… schools, uh… I would take a uh… just blind eye to reported bullying. It happens a lot in which very often the, the victim is the one that's victimized and actually happened they took the victim out of the class because it was easier than dealing with the bullies. Now, try to get your head around that. 

00:38:05
[sil.] 

00:38:10
PAUL SWINGLE Okay, so family strife, and if you remember the very first slide I showed you this afternoon, was simply a, a pencil and paper uh…data from a Q that I did. And I asked the woman it looks like you're going to a severe trauma, a lot of severe emotional stress, and looks like it's in a personal and she, well, that's when she said she's going through a nasty divorce, and basically when you see the trauma marker. Uh… that's a game changer in terms of how you're able to uh… respond to the clients. And again if you look here there's a depression marker and that is the inner personal issue. So there's your family strife variable. Okay, so, trauma at CZ and you want the alpha response to be greater than 30% at O1 you want it greater than 50. On our new software we're doing two measurements, so we do instead of one 15 second epic, we're doing two or three shorter epics because what you'll find with the artist is uh… it'll go up at the very beginning and then drop, but it's so high in the beginning that it masks these, these cutoffs. So if you measure at say uh…two 10 second intervals you're very likely to find the second one is below the 30% and that's a trauma marker for somebody with strong resonant alpha. 

00:40:05
[sil.] 

00:40:10
PAUL SWINGLE There are all kinds of treatments associated with trying to deal with trauma, hence, uh… one of the things that we find very important is exercise. Hence, uh… the breathing you can you do heart rate variability, can identify uh… the breathing rhythm that gives maximum variance, and that's extremely relaxing. And the other of course is exercise we give out pedometers, and we want them to get up to ten thousand steps a day, that's an active individual and they slowly work up to that. And again the processing emotional trauma is, feel it, allow it the happen, in fact try to push it and make it more intense than it is, exactly the opposite of what every cell in your body is telling you to do. Share it, this is where the healing circle comes in. And sleep on it, so we have to make sure your sleep is okay. Hence… uh… this again is a sleep, and data on a uh… trauma person and there is very, very serious problem in terms of deficient REM. So when we're doing trauma release, one of the things we try to do is get the sleep architecture good and then if luck is with us then the trauma gets released in sleep, best of all possible worlds. And here is the brain driving again. Hence, the heart Meridian and here is your trauma release in terms of uh… pushing up trauma, and it's like pushing up Alpha uh… where we're using stimulation of meridian, heart meridian 7.8 hertz with flashing lights. 

00:42:40
[sil.] 

00:42:45
PAUL SWINGLE And I already showed you this, this is the trauma release uh…in which Alpha starts to climb and then when it reaches a certain point then you get beta engaged, and the alpha drops, that's what trauma looks like when you're working with it. And the Adjunctive Therapies, uh… experiential psychotherapy uh… this is Alan Moore (ph) and Albert Alice(ph), and basically what you try to do there is to force a trauma release uh… and the procedure is whatever's on the front burn or I want you to make it as intense as possible. So you're getting it to actually work on the emotion, so if they're feeling depressed I want you to feel more depressed than you've ever felt in your life, that's the, the procedure of experiential psychotherapy. A lot of people were very afraid of that, somebody comes in depressed, then you tell to be well, I want to be more depressed, okay. And so, it takes a while to work up to that, we try to get the brain so that it processes efficiently, that we can do experiential psychotherapy or I do hypnosis, EMDR kinds of things and so forth. Okay, uh… This is just more information that medicating a trauma is not a good idea. And this is a severe drug addicted client, Mark trauma, find out a lot in drug addiction by the way as you might imagine, and these are the after EMDR the theta/beta ratios in the back of the brain. So you can do this in a lot of ways, everything you do influences the brain as Mike pointed out this morning, so there are more ways than one (inaudible ). Neurotherapy I find is a very efficient way but there are other ways of doing it and EMDR is one, there are a lot of people who practice EMDR as a trauma treatment therapy without any neuro. 

00:45:05
[sil.] 

00:45:10
PAUL SWINGLE This again was a hospitalized guy at McLean Hospital and he… was attending a uh… a memorial uh… a Vietnam uh… demonstration and there were a couple of hecklers in the crowd and he was very, very upset about that and he went home and got his service revolver. Now the thing that I find startling is a man who was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, what is he doing with his service revolver, but that's another issue. He went and got his service revolver emptied it so it, there was no, and there are no bullets in it and he went back to the uh… the uh… memorial, whatever it was, walked over to the, the heckler, held a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. And the police were not at all happy about that, you know. So uh… the potential for these kinds of situations exploding is very, very significant. And what we did with it was alpha brain driving exactly what we always do, trauma release, somato emotional release, he needed a couple sessions and once we got the alpha response in place I think he was able to uh… benefit from his regular group therapy. Group therapy from a vets is extremely good mechanism for dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder. 

00:47:00
[sil.] 

00:47:05
PAUL SWINGLE Okay, one of the issues associated with this is when you have a combat PTSD. Uh… you almost always have head injury associated with that. And uh… in addition to trauma release you have to pay attention to some of the other aspects associated with the traumatic brain injury and with traumatic brain injury we usually in addition to the clinical queue do a full queue so that we can see how the brain is talking to itself. And here is a full queue on a person with post-traumatic stress disorder but a traumatic brain injury and here's what you typically find is a lot of hyper connectivity in the high frequencies. And traumatic brain injury and seizure are highly correlated and this is the reason it's highly correlated, because activity that starts in one area spreads. So it's a spreading of fast frequency uh… activity and, you know, that remarkably reduces seizure threshold. Fibromyalgia, find trauma in it almost, always. And it's probably somato size traumatic event. It's probably what Fibromyalgia actually is. And a lot of people don't want to treat Fibromyalgia because they claim it's untreatable. But take care of the trauma, make sure the sleep's okay and take care of their frontal cortex and they can start to wean themselves off. Demands. Okay, our outreach program uh… I can't remember who is talking to me about this meeting, but we treat the homeless uh… and the mechanism for dealing with that it requires that you have some structured environment, because they're homeless and you want to do neurotherapy with them you can't be going from park bench to park bench trying to find them. So there are a couple of options, one is the food kitchens so that when they come in uh… for, you know, their meal and that they are able to pick them up uh… may be once a week maybe twice a week to do some neurotherapy on them. The other was a resident in which the, the first time off the streets into a residential facility, and uh… the other is, were doing it through a church that has a drop in center and they started a residency as well. But this was a, this, yeah this was a woman who would was on the streets and she got in touch with her daughter after we did the treatments on her, and her daughter was unaware of what I'd given rise to her mother's, you know, a good, becoming homeless, and just, you know, we're dropping out of everything. So she's now back in the daughter's home and minding her grand daughter.

PAUL SWINGLE Oh, yeah, we get a lot of this kind of thing from the homeless that we've treated. One guy didn't show up for a visit because he got a job. Now one of the things that I find so outrageous about our culture is we had to discontinue our outreach program down in the Vancouver East side uh… and the reason that we had to discontinue it was we were, our project was killed and you know who killed it? The agencies funded to take care of the homeless. Somebody was mentioning a school, that's what it was in which uh… they didn't want people being treated for dyslexia, I think it was because then they wouldn't have anybody in the school, was that you, Mike, talking about that. So the uh… the organization literally killed it, it was middle, middle management, they would cooperate in terms of their case workers and they wouldn't provide us with any room and it's just amazing. We used the a safe room concept with these people as well, where they could go and give themselves treatment just go and listen to a harmonica.

PAUL SWINGLE All right I wouldn't follow, hadn't written anything in ten years, and ended up writing up as resume and then getting a job, just some very interesting things. And this is the data I, I was talking about in which the treatment of an acute condition with medication turns a lot of acute conditions into chronic conditions. And these are the data, and, and this is the United States data, and what this is looking at is number of permanent disability due to mood disorders over the, you know, this period of time. And if you look at that and you look at the increase in indication of depression or the use of psychotropic medication, it is a direct correlation. And it's not only the United States but have data from the UK, Australia, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, that uh… the marked increase in new cases in mental health disability simultaneously with marked increase in persons taking any depressive medication. 

00:53:40

00:53:50
PAUL SWINGLE Yes, and this is something that I find is very interesting. Uh… if the patients are taking an antidepressant they after one year only about 3% were well. And if you look at the regular course of depression, without medication, at the end of the year only 6% were depressed. So the data are very clear, that what you're doing is you're creating a lifelong problem. 

00:54:20
[sil.] 

00:54:30
PAUL SWINGLE Uh… I think this is the, the same data uh… from another study in terms of, uh… if they're medicated only about 5% of the individuals we met by the end of the year. 

00:54:55
[sil.] 

00:55:00
PAUL SWINGLE Okay, so the number of patients uh… in remission the number in chronic depression so here are your data right here. And, hence again medicating this kind of condition doesn't seem to be very efficient, and we did the, the book that I just showed you. Uh… and this is the, that individual prepared these data for a presentation that was made to the U.K. House of Commons in terms of the problems associated with how medication is increasing the problems associated with management of mental health. And mood disorders in the U.K. and the data are very compelling, that's where these data have come from. He did that presentation in May of this, of last year at the House of Commons. Okay, there is one in here in which, you know, when your recovery rates in the NIMH study of un-medicated depression, how many are recovered after one month, after six months, and after twelve months. So at the end the twelve months, 85% percent of the individuals were in remission, un-medicated. And medicated, how many individuals have only one uh… depression episode, no, uh… treated with a drug, treated without a drug, and without a drug 76% only have one episode treated with a drug, 50% have more than one episode and those with more than, oops, those with more than two episodes… 

00:57:10

00:57:15
PAUL SWINGLE Uh… again you can see 17% versus 31. So the data are pretty compelling with regard to that, and the other thing I think is interesting is one of the procedures recommended for treating depression is exercise, okay. And here's an example of how medication, and reduces the efficacy of exercise as a treatment for depression. 

00:57:45

PAUL SWINGLE I told you I was going to show you a slide of a Medic, heavily medicated client in which we're not able to get traction because of a highly chemicalized brain. And this is brain driving, very aggressive brain driving, and you can see that the brain activity didn't, didn't budge, absolutely flatline. Hence, she wrote a complementary state in the RateMD. So I'll show you what she said about us truly and RateMD. Okay. So, these are four RateMDs taken sequentially. The first, uh… where's that one, "Oh, I only wish she was my father," this was not her by the way. But this is the woman we were just talking about, "I went to Dr Swingle for three years, 30 sessions and put four thousand I think she said, and dollars and with the assessment he said I would only need 15 sessions and she proved to be medication free, okay. Uh… then she goes on to say she talked of all the patients in my waiting room and they all had the same story, that uh… you know, I'm just no good, okay. So, this is the casualty associated with medicated conditions in which, when you're working with a chemicalized brain it's very difficult to get traction, so sometimes what we have to do is give the person home exercises to do, work very closely with the physician and do very aggressive neurotherapy. And when we see that we're starting to get traction because the titrating down diligence thought to make some progress. But lot of uh… a lot of individuals that are highly medicated, they just don't have the stamina to do that, that, you know, just taking a pill is easier even though they're very dissatisfied with the condition that they're in, it's very paradoxical. Thank you.
