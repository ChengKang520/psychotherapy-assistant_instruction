BODY & SOUL 

00:01:15
GAIL HARRIS You may not think of yourself as an angry person, but if your first impulse when something goes wrong is to blame somebody and then get mad. Maybe you want to rethink that one. Hi, I’m Gail Harris, welcome to Body and Soul. The experts say that getting angry is like taking a small does of poison every day of your life. It may not hurt you right away, but eventually it is likely to take toe on your health. What can you do about it, we asked a husband and wife team who study anger professionally to show us, not only how to make our lives happier, but longer. 

00:01:50
Overcoming Anger: Healing from Within 

00:02:00
[sil.] 

00:02:05
DAVID MICHAEL I’ve always felt that I was compassionate towards other people and then I cared about them. Apparently, my behavior just didn’t show that. My name is David Michael and I’m 38 years old. I work for the court system in North Carolina. My style used to be fairly authoritarian and it was my job; everywhere I went to find things that were wrong. You have stress at home and you have stress at work, all those things would conspire together, so that my normal responses were heated. I’d come home from work and my kids would go daddy, you’re yelling. I wasn’t yelling. I didn’t think I was yelling. Do you want to see yelling? 

00:02:50
NARRATOR What happens to our bodies, when we get angry every day? Research here at Duke University Medical Center is proving that chronic anger is dangerous to your health. 

00:03:05
REDFORD WILLIAMS, MD Co-author, Anger Kills You know used to not matter how much fat you ate, you feed all the fat you wanted. Now it matters because we live long enough for eating more fat to the fact arteriosclerosis. Well, in the same way and now matters about anger because we live longer and it can have an effect on our lifespan. 

00:03:25
So this is the crazy glue… 

00:03:25
NARRATOR We ask David to come to Dr. Williams laboratory to demonstrate the changes our bodies go through when we feel angry. 

00:03:35
DR. REDFORD WILLIAMS Anger can be a useful emotion. Anger is what lets us know there is danger. It lets us know that we should take action to change a bad situation. Where anger becomes a problem is when it’s happening frequently over really little things day in and day out. Some of us are more sensitive to experience that kind of anger, we have a lower threshold to have that anger turned on in our brain and others. 

00:04:05
NARRATOR The experiment begins by getting a baseline reading of David’s blood pressure at rest. In this case, it’s 123 over 80, about average. 

00:04:20
Now, I want you to recall a time in the past when you felt very angry at another person. This should be a situation or incident that still makes you angry right now when you think about it. 

00:04:30
DAVID MICHAEL In last week I was travelling, I was on the road and called home like I do every night when I travel and my wife gave me the bad news over the phone that one of our cars had it’s motor burn up. 

00:04:45
NARRATOR As David retells the story, his anger triggers a series of physical reactions. 

00:04:50
DAVID MICHAEL I was just tensed all in my arms and across my chest. 

00:04:55
NARRATOR David’s heart begins to beat faster, pumping four times more blood than normal. 

00:05:00
DAVID MICHAEL The way it should have come on, if it come on I would had checked the oil. 

00:05:05
NARRATOR His stress hormones kick in, releasing extra energy. 

00:05:05
DAVID MICHAEL By meaning that that the car broke and that this was going to cost me a lot of money, but… 

00:05:10
NARRATOR His immune system shuts down temporarily. 

00:05:15
DAVID MICHAEL And, and I couldn’t do anything about it. I was very frustrated. 

00:05:20
NARRATOR Over time, these daily doses of anger damage our arteries and make us more susceptible to infection. 

00:05:25
DR. REDFORD WILLIAMS We’re talking about your own anger killing you. The anger that you experience day in and day out is going to cause you over time to have changes in your body that going to make you more likely to have a heart attack and die by age 50. 

00:05:45
DAVID MICHAEL I could certainly see that a pattern of being angry was going to raise my blood pressure, was going to make more more likely to have hypertension. But what really scared me was that that frustration that alienation would result in losing the affection with my family. 

00:06:10
FAITH MICHAEL Does it end in the same? Yeah, it’s all right. I always wanted it to change, I didn’t know how to make a change. I didn’t know in my mind what I could differently. And so, day-after-day we would get into these, these little toast and then he go of his direction I go of my direction and I had my children, they took my attention. 

00:06:35
FAITH MICHAEL That’s right. Um, okay, we’re up to nine now here, going to ten. 

00:06:40
FAITH MICHAEL It’s interesting because David started to have problems that were and the people at work pressured him into getting help; whereas, I can’t. The people work that. 

00:06:50
FAITH MICHAEL 33. Yeah… 

00:06:55
ROBIN CASARJIAN Almost everybody, all the time… 

00:06:55
NARRATOR About a year ago, David attended a workshop like this one. Part of the life skills program created by Redford and Virginia Williams. 

00:07:05
VIRGINIA WILLIAMS What do you think this women has experiencing? 

00:07:10
NARRATOR The first step is to keep a daily log of emotional ups and downs. Beginning with the objective facts of the situation. 

00:07:15
VIRGINIA WILLIAMS, PHD Co-author, Lifeskills It becomes important to separate out how the world really is treating you in which case you probably do need to take some action. And when it is your own stuff. 

00:07:30
DAVID MICHAEL When I first started doing the journaling it was very difficult to even articulate the facts much less how I felt. But now I can do it in the car driving on the roads at a stoplight and I can think about something and how I felt, how I want to respond, it’s very normal. People say to chill-out, but they don’t really tell you how to do that, and so, it was a big deal for me to learn how to slow down my breathing. So that I could actually, physically calm my body when I was upset, and also to change my mind when I had a thought that was, that kept going over-and-over in my mind, it was stirring me up and making me angry and angry, I never realized I could just say stop. 

00:08:05
VIRGINIA WILLIAMS If you react immediately and you perceive danger. You’re reptilian brain, at the base of your brain is what you’re reacting with. 

00:08:15
I was a little annoyed and was a little angry… 

00:08:20
NARRATOR The Lifeskills program trains participants to ask for key questions before deciding whether or not to act on their anger. 

00:08:30
VIRGINIA WILLIAMS The first question is, is this matter important to me? It is what I’m feeling appropriate to the objective facts of the situation. Is this situation modifiable, then you come to the fourth question. Would it be worth it? Take the action necessary to get this situation change. Okay. Let’s see how well is this going to work in real, real practice? 

00:09:00
DR. REDFORD WILLIAMS It’s really very encouraging that training people to manage anger and other negative emotions better that training people in skills that build more supportive relationships really does improve your health. Heart patients who get this kind of training survive longer. Cancer patients who get this kind of training survive longer and even, regular medical patients with chronic conditions that are not life threatening getting this kind of training cost less to take care of, their medical cost go down. So there is a lot of very encouraging research that learning these kinds of skills to manage negative emotions like anger and build stronger social relationships, really does enhance health. 

00:09:45
[sil.] 

00:09:50
DAVID MICHAEL It starts off like anything feeling artificial and feeling phony or fate, but the more I worked at it, the more normal it became. 

00:10:05
[sil.] 

00:10:10
FAITH MICHAEL What I realize now is I have hope that no matter what happens you know whether car or house or kids, we’re going to work it out and that’s just really exciting to me. 

00:10:25
DAVID MICHAEL I don’t know that changes who I am, but it changes how I respond to my world, and then it changes how the world responds to me. And so, it is definitely worth it. It’s not always easy, but I know that the more you deal with, the easier it gets. 

00:10:45
Next… Help YourSelf 

00:10:45
OVERCOMING ANGER: •see another point of view •don’t take it personally •keep it in perspective •think about result •slow down 

00:10:50
GAIL HARRIS Do you ever have an over step suitcase or some other heavy load that you had to carry around for a while, remember when you finally got to put it down how much lighter you felt, how you could almost bounce through the rest of your day, anger is a lot like that, a burden that most of us frankly, would be a lot better off without. Easier said than done of course and how exactly do you go about it? One good place to start is by trying to see the world from the other person’s point of view. Is your spouse really trying to row in your life when they don’t come home for dinner on time or is there another explanation, like traffic? Maybe they didn’t know that being on time is important to you and that you would like a phone call if you’re going to be late. If your boss passes you in hallway without saying hello, is she being rude or her mind maybe on something else at the moment. You get the idea, it’s easy to see things from our own point of view, but you’ll save yourself a lot of grief if you can also see it from someone else’s. Point two, keep things in perspective. Will it matter from a year from now, even a week from now, if someone cuts you off in traffic? Is your dignity as a driver worth getting a stomachache over? Also think about what the result will be, if letting your anger built when someone you’re expecting is late, for example, is your evening likely to be more or less pleasant, if you jump all over them when they do arrive. Finally, as and so many parts of life, the key to controlling anger is to slow things down. Your mom probably told you to count ten when you’re angry, it’s still a good technique. When you’re done counting, pause for a moment and ask yourself.

00:12:30
GAIL HARRIS If I blow my top over this, is it worth it? And who am I really hurting? Them or me? Either way, are you sure that’s what you want to do? 

00:12:40
Next… Robin Casarjian 

00:12:50
NARRATOR For most of her career, psychotherapist, author and lecturer Robin Casarjian has helped people find their way from anger all the way to it’s opposite. Forgiveness. 

00:13:00
GAIL HARRIS Robin why is forgiveness important? 

00:13:00
ROBIN CASARJIAN Author, Forgiveness Forgiveness frees the forgiver. We do it in order to free ourselves, so we can move on with our lives, so that we can be peaceful and happy. How many people think, I’m not going to forgive that person as to what they’ve done? Thinking. When we say that that, if I forgive them, I’m doing them a favor not realizing that the favor that we’re doing is a favor to ourselves. We hold on to the resentment and anger, we won’t be happy people. 

00:13:30
GAIL HARRIS How do you begin that process? 

00:13:30
ROBIN CASARJIAN Willingness is the first step. Willingness, and I think also in understanding a forgiveness, and understanding of what it isn’t. I love the way Rev. Wayne Miller talks about forgiveness. He said, what we’re forgiving is not the act. What we act for giving is the people, the people who couldn’t manage to honor and cherish themselves to honor and cherish perhaps their own spouse or their own children or other people what we’re forgiving is their confusion, their ignorance, their unskillfulness, sometimes their desperation. So with understanding that we’re not condoning in act when we forgive. In other words, you can forgive an old friend from whom you’ve been strange and it doesn’t mean you have to call them up or see them or you can forgive an ex-spouse and you can forgive your husband or your wife and decide you need a divorce? Forgiveness isn’t about what we do, but it’s a change of heart, it’s a shift in perception, it’s a different way of looking at what’s been done. 

00:14:35
GAIL HARRIS What if the person just flat doesn’t deserve it? 

00:14:40
ROBIN CASARJIAN Well, you have to ask yourself, do you deserve to be peaceful? Do you deserve to be happy? When we hold on to anger, it’s like we have a handcuff around our wrist and we handcuff to the person toward whom we hold that resentment. So when I forgive, I take the key which I always hold and I open the handcuff and now I can move on, unencumbered. We don’t have to say, oh you’re absented(ph) today? Well, here you can have all my peace then. You’re absented(ph) today oh okay, we’ll hear you. You can have all my joy today. I’ll give it to you. So this way you take it back for yourself, you see the situation more clearly. And you’re freed in the process. 

00:15:20
GAIL HARRIS I once heard a line about anger, which went when you’re angry at someone it’s like holding a hot coal in the palm of your hand for a very long time, just in case you might get it throw it at that person sometime. You know, but in the meantime what are you doing to yourself? 

00:15:35
ROBIN CASARJIAN That’s right. And you’re burning yourself. And this is very, very high price for that in terms of personal wellbeing, sometimes in pers… in terms of physical symptoms and in terms of feeling connected spiritually to the world. I really feel in our culture that we’ve not been taught how to bring forgiveness from kind of a lofty idea or a spiritual idea that we’ve been taught in our religions training down to a practical strategy that we can truly integrate into our day-to-day lives. 

00:16:05
GAIL HARRIS Is there such a thing is fake forgiveness, in other words, oh yes, fine. I forgive you expect that still inside what’s happening is urrr… 

00:16:15
ROBIN CASARJIAN Absolutely. Absolutely. A lot of people use forgiveness as an avoidance technique. I don’t really want to deal with this, so I’ll forgive when I don’t want. They don’t really want to communicate honestly or they just don’t know how. Sometimes we say we forget, but what we’re really doing is lying to the other person or lying to ourselves or avoiding the truth or repressing our anger. It’s like putting whip creaming on top of garbage, you’ll be dug into it, you really wouldn’t want to eat what was there. But it looks good on the surface, but this something riding underneath. 

00:16:50
GAIL HARRIS How about in a work situation? How can this idea help when you’re dealing with a difficult colleague and I’m sure we’ve all encountered difficult colleagues among the way, people that you just really didn’t want to be in the same zip code with. 

00:17:05
ROBIN CASARJIAN Yes. Say, I have a boss who is really old just irresponsible and kind of abusive in her ongoing basis, but I, I don’t want to leave the job. What do I do in a situation like that? Do I just everyday go in, stressed out and feel angry and feel resentful towards this person or can I go in and see wow, that person is really hurting. See I can either take it personally or I can stand back and observe that person or circumstance in a way that allows me not to take it so personally. I’ll often think that when we hold on to our resentments and somebody is out in, being manipulative controlling, it’s like we’re on the dance flow with the person. And there we are with dancing cheek-to-cheek with this person we really don’t want to be dancing, but and when we can step back and really see the dynamic to see fearful what it is, to develop clarity, to, to take a stance when we need to. Forgiving doesn’t mean that we don’t set boundaries, sometimes non-negotiable boundaries that we hesitate to take action when it’s the appropriate thing to do, but there is a way in which we emotionally extricate ourselves. There’s is an expression I sometimes use which is life is like a stone now, it will grind you down or it will polish you up. In which it does is out in the way up to you. 

00:18:35
GAIL HARRIS Anger kills, forgiveness heals. Sounds simple enough, doesn’t it? But sometimes, life brings more problems than solutions, an absent father, poverty, alcoholism, physical or sexual abuse. Like father, like son, like mother, like daughter, is it possible to break the cycle and develop loving relationships no matter where you are. Robin Casarjian think so, she spends her days teaching prison inmates how to do just that. Turning houses a punishment in the houses of healing. 

00:19:15
GAIL HARRIS How is it that they came into the world like every child. A beautiful divine, delightful spirit. What happened between the time that they were this amazing little being, and the time they came into prison. 

00:19:40
NARRATOR Scott Hollis is struggling to find an answer to that question. He spent the last two years locked up in the Suffolk County house of corruption in Boston. 

00:19:50
SCOTT HOLLIS Houses of Healing workshop I really don’t know what the problem is within me, but I know there is a problem. 

00:19:55
NARRATOR As a first step, Scott signed up for Robin Casarjian’s workshop on anger and forgiveness. 

00:20:00
ROBIN CASARJIAN Author, Houses of Healing …either gonna feel it and let it out or you’re going to act it out on somebody else or you’re going to act in on yourself with a diction and your life won’t work. 

00:20:10
NARRATOR In 12 sessions over three months, Casarjian shows them how to get pass the wreckage of their lives. They begin by exploring early abuse and family violence. 

00:20:20
SCOTT HOLLIS I ran away when I was 11. So and I took my little brother with me, but he’s got you little bad, you know, we slept in hallways and all that you know I got him a job, I’m working since I was you know 11, 10 years old, taking care of him, you know so, I really never had a childhood. 

00:20:35
ROBIN CASARJIAN When you feel if some sadness coming out, I want to encourage you don’t stuff it. Because you need to feel to heal. And everything on it’s way up is on it’s way out and when you feel then you don’t have to act your pain out on another people and you don’t have to turn it back on yourself either. 

00:20:55
NARRATOR Acknowledging the truth about what they have done, in the impact of what they’ve done on other people, on their families, on their communities, on themselves is an intrical part of the emotional healing process. 

00:21:10
RAMONE SCHARPE Houses of Healing workshop I’m sorry for helping to mess up the world. Now, uh, the reason I said is when I was younger, you know I used to drink 40 ounces with my friends and go around, after no reason, we’d like to punch somebody you know real stupid stuff. And one day, I was downtown you know these three white with ties were walking down the street. And I punched one of the guys right in his tie, you know and I laugh with my friends, but I’ve been thinking about it over the years and I’m wondering, how many times was that guy behind the desk, you know the guy looks just like me, came in looking for a job. And he said, you know kind of looks like the guy who hit me, you know no way. You know he came in the red stamp on his application. 

00:21:50
NARRATOR Taking responsibility for the past, talking about it, sometimes even writing letters of apology help Scott and other members of the class start building a sense of who they are. 

00:22:00
…as the time goes on. 

00:22:05
NARRATOR Meditation deepens the process. 

00:22:05
ROBIN CASARJIAN The most revolutionary world in personal act is simply learning how to sit still and he said, shut up. Because what will come of that is quite extraordinary, we’ll always be put in the right direction if we can do that for ourselves. 

00:22:30
ROBIN CASARJIAN Meditation helps them for one to quiet down to watch their thoughts, to watch their feelings, to become aware of their body sensations. So that when a strong feeling say like, anger comes out, that they can have their anger rather than their anger having that. When their emotions have them, they just act on them, their impulsive that’s what we do when we get lost in the anger. Through meditation, they begin to see that they can have that anger and begin to relay to it in a more mature, thoughtful wise way so they can decide how they want to act on that anger. 

00:23:15
SCOTT HOLLIS The part of the meditation that I like was um, when we go back to a, a safe place. I select to fish off this rock and, and then I felt most peaceful when I was on that rock fishing. So now, when I go into my mediation I had started go back to that rock. That helped me to mature a lot more, that teach myself to think and I wasn’t timed. Then I don’t have to do certain things to be accepted, you know I can be me. 

00:23:50
NARRATOR What Scott learned has left him hopeful. But now, he can avoid the problems that got him here. 

00:23:55
SCOTT HOLLIS I didn’t wanted to end. To me that was my little family. I could go to anyone of those guys and talk about anything and feel good and it just gives of this energy that was so, you know like coming with my brother, you know she is like a sister, like I did a class everyday for rest of my life. And basically, I do. I just do it on my own now because I got a chance to get my spirituality back. And now I’m just alright to forgive myself. So that’s helped me to be able to recover from my drugs and alcohol. 

00:24:35
NARRATOR It’s also given Scott the confidence to make a fresh start. 

00:24:40
SCOTT HOLLIS When they first let me out, I was like you know I was scared because I’ve been incarcerated for 25 months. Everything around me had changed. Well, I got the bakery job through the Moving Ahead Program. We’ve been discussing and that time I would like to go into the bakery field because I, you know I basically like to cook. You know so, I actually went in there trying to show them what I knew and there was a lot that I didn’t know and I let him know that, you know I didn’t know everything, but I was willing to learn and I’m very teachable. And I know they didn’t like to that because they offered me a position, so they got to take them up when they’re offering.
