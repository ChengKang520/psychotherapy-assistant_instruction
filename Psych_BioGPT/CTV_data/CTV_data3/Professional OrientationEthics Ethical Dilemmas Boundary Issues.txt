SHANNON DERMER Hi, welcome and thank you for joining us. I'm here today with Dr. Pat Robey who will introduce herself in a moment. I'm Dr. Shannon Dermer from Governors State University and I'm the chair of the Division of Psychology and Counseling. And today we are going to be talking about some CACREP accreditation standards and we will be discussing in particular boundary violations under the professional ethics area. And our expert today who is going to be discussing this topic and who will be demonstrating some issues on how to talk to a… a counselor supervisee about her relationship with clients is Dr. Pat Robey. Pat will you introduce yourself?

00:01:05
PATRICIA ROBEY Well, hello good to be here. I am uh… an associate professor at Governor State University. I am a licensed professional counselor, so I've had experiences on both end of this issue with… in counseling and then also teaching our students about how to recognize their own boundary issues. And I'm a supervisor as well. So these kind of issues come up often in our relationships with clients and members of the community. And whether I can be an expert or not is something else because I think uh… it's such a lot of grey areas that there is a lot of discussion about what creates a boundary issue and what isn't. So that's some of the things that we will be talking about today. 

00:01:50
SHANNON DERMER Good. And I know that when I was a trainee the idea of discussing professional issues and ethics is like oh it's a clash you have to take. But throughout the years and through training other people, I began to realize that it's not just about listening to clients, it's not just about doing interventions that ethics really create the foundation for a safe trusting relationship. And that it's the idea that ethical base of how we make decisions, how we protect ourselves, how we protect our clients, and how we protect the public that really creates the safety that allows for a warm therapeutic alliance or relationship. 

00:02:35
PATRICIA ROBEY That's right. I think when students begin to realize that the ethics are in place as guidelines not rigid rules that that's helpful for them. And it's a protecting and… so we have the ACA American Counseling Association Code of Ethics. And right there in the preamble it talks about the reasons that we have the Codes of Ethics. And it's to look at considerations because there are so many things that we don't even realize could be an issue. And today we're going to talk about boundary issues and multiple or dual relationships. And that's just one of the paces the ethics fell on and on. But the idea about the ethics is that is a guide and how to understand what course of action to take. So it's not a cut and dried it gives a lot of flexibility, but that also leads to grey areas. And the other thing that the Code of Ethics does is that it gives us an idea about Code of Contact… Conduct… excuse me. Where we emphasis primarily on the counselor's role because we are the ones who are in-charge of the sessions and we need to know what specifically we're supposed to be doing there. 

00:03:50
SHANNON DERMER Right. So, you made the point. There are actually very few ethical standards that are just you can never do this mostly they are to help us… in our ethical decision making process. And so with… with clients especially although there can be different multiple relationships or what used to be called dual relationships, there can be different multiple relationships with clients. So it's a guide on how to handle those and manage them and make good decisions not how to avoid them completely. 

00:04:25
PATRICIA ROBEY That's right. And we're going to be talking today about boundaries in particular. And in a sense it's important to know what the boundaries are. But they're very fluid and that's one of the dilemmas and so to think about what is a boundary and it really is a conceptual framework because it's not like somebody says, well here is the line don't cross it. But for us to be able to use these codes as guidelines and so the boundary defines the framework that surrounds the relationship and in the roles in the relationship are defined by the Code of Ethics and the preambles are the relationship itself. So what is the client coming in for or what do they hope to accomplish. And that defines what the relationship is going to be. So for example, if I was coaching it would be a different relationship than if I was working with a family, than if I was working for an individual substance abuse whatever the issue is that a client brings in is kind of what defines the relationship and what we're going to do. And this is really important to protecting us, but also to… protecting the client welfare. And this is where there are a lot of shades of grey and there isn't a… 

00:05:40
SHANNON DERMER Not fifty shades of grey? 

00:05:45
PATRICIA ROBEY Not fifty. 

00:05:45
SHANNON DERMER Ah okay. 

00:05:45
PATRICIA ROBEY I know I thought about that when I said that. 

00:05:45
SHANNON DERMER Because that's a whole different discussion. 

00:05:50
PATRICIA ROBEY Right, but it's… it's a challenging thing because there isn't even really agreement among professionals about where the boundaries lie. And so as just as an example I remember I was working with the client when I was in internships and the client gave me a gift. You know this is one of those things where you can cross boundaries. And it was a precious moment for Yuri which she didn't know, but I collected those and so I knew that they were expensive. And so I was like, oh, my gosh what do I do, you know, I was really taking it back thinking about the ethics and what does this mean and all those criteria. And so for me when that happened I was thinking does this cross a line. Well, what was interesting about that considering it from a boundary perspective or an ethical perspective my supervisor said, "well how much, is it worth less than $50 or more than $50" which I thought well that's kind of an interesting way to define a boundary. 

00:06:45
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:06:45
PATRICIA ROBEY And then what was the value of it to her. 

00:06:45
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:06:45
PATRICIA ROBEY Could she afford it. And then for him, that was a nominal amount. For me, it was a lot. So it was kind of to illustrate the challenges and defining where actually are the roles or are the boundaries of what makes something okay and what doesn't. And then that leads to the kind of boundaries that we have and the kind of ethics we have which are the mandatory ethics which we must do. 

00:07:10
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:07:10
PATRICIA ROBEY And then the aspirational ethics, so how do we want to be and then what do we want to do in those situations. 

00:07:20
SHANNON DERMER All right. I remember my supervisor when I was a master's and had a similar thing. I think back then because it was a long time ago. It was like $15, which is like, but also was this a pattern of giving presents, what was the meaning behind it, and I remember he said if it's under $15 and it's you know termination or it's a holiday or something like that don't worry about it you know too much. And he said if it was food feed to the interns first and then you can eat it if everyone is okay. So, so yeah it was a little work guidelines definitely not a set… 

00:07:50
PATRICIA ROBEY Right, right. And I don't know when that was, but I heard $15 is supposed to 50, so see there again… 

00:07:55
SHANNON DERMER I know if it's a… 

00:07:55
PATRICIA ROBEY You know to me fifty bucks was a lot of money. 

00:07:55
SHANNON DERMER Yeah, yeah. 

00:08:00
PATRICIA ROBEY So… so, that's one of the issues that we have when we think about crossing boundaries or dual relationships. And now we talk about multiple relationships because it's very easy to have more than just one-on-one. And what happens when you move into a multiple relationship is that all of a sudden you're in more than the one role that you contracted to do. And it's easy to have that happen before you know you can slip in. I remember just another story when I was in a supervision group, one of the counselors came in and she was really in a struggle because she was having a transference… counter transference relationship with her client where she was the little sister to this client who was big sister. And she could kind of feel it happening, but the client got ill and asked her to come over and visit what she did. And then she asked her to bring groceries and that all of a sudden it became blowing up where now there were in… to a different type of relationship. And she was really at a loss as to what to do. And so part of our roles as educators and supervisors is to be able to help focus that back on what is the meaning, what's going on, and what is the personal implications for that. You know, what was going on with her, so, but it was that easy slide. 

00:09:15
SHANNON DERMER It, it is, it is an easy you know, a slide. And I think also we have to careful because when we do realize that we're down that slippery slope that… and we do pull back and set more of a firm boundary with our clients that sometimes they're offended or their feelings are hurt. 

00:09:35
PATRICIA ROBEY Well that's it isn't it because once this happens how do you go back. 

00:09:40
SHANNON DERMER Right. Instead of it being an ongoing discussion I know that I used to do in-home family therapy so that even challenges the boundary is more someone answers the door in their pyjamas, you're in their home they offer you food, things like that, but also that I just know when I used to do counseling in a very small town where you're likely to bump in the clients outside and how do you handle that. And I remember not discussing that with the client first. And I didn't say anything to her in public and she was very offended. And when I tried to repair it later and discuss it with her it was little too late her feelings were kind of… already hurt and versus from then on because I knew we're in a small town and I was likely to bump into people. I always had that conversation upfront before it happened. And we can't predict everything, but there are certainly or certain situation when we know it's more unlikely and to have that discussion with clients. 

00:10:35
PATRICIA ROBEY Well if that goes to the value of having a disclosure statement before you actually start your session so that people understand what the nature of the relationship is. 

00:10:45
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:10:45
PATRICIA ROBEY And… but you're right it's really hard to cover every base. 

00:10:45
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:10:50
PATRICIA ROBEY Because there are always the unknowns. For example, another dual relationship conflict that comes into place is a professional relationships like counselor educators and students. You know, we work with students, we go to conferences with students and sometimes students are on a budget very often they are. And to be mindful if we ask a student if they want to share a room then what does that mean? And you know it could be well we have a nice relationship, but now all of a sudden like through a person who answers the door in their pyjamas it's all of a sudden is a different kind of situation. 

00:11:20
SHANNON DERMER Yeah, yeah. 

00:11:25
PATRICIA ROBEY And the other relationship conflict that comes into play is when family members or friends or romantic partners want to get service from you. 

00:11:30
SHANNON DERMER Well, yeah. 

00:11:30
PATRICIA ROBEY And I found that, we probably all know that situation. I found that goes two ways that goes could you I need some counseling would you talk to me for a while. And the other part of it is I'm just saying how are you today don't try and counsel me right? 

00:11:50
SHANNON DERMER Yes, yes. 

00:11:50
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah. 

00:11:50
SHANNON DERMER I know that, you have, you're going to do a demonstration in a little while. What are the major concepts or ideas that you want me and all of them to know before you do a demonstration? 

00:12:05
PATRICIA ROBEY Hmm-hmm well, in this case we're going to be talking about a student who counsel and training who is having difficulties in a counselor relationship that is going a little bit toward a romantic relationship and the struggles that the student is having in managing that for herself as well as managing the client. And you know when you look at the ACA Code of Ethics related to boundaries those sexual boundary issues are, 

00:12:35
SHANNON DERMER Pretty clear. 

00:12:35
PATRICIA ROBEY Oh, my gosh, they're very clear and they go all the way from sexual and romantic relationships where these are the forbidden prohibited, 

00:12:45
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:12:45
PATRICIA ROBEY To a personal or virtual relationships with current clients, so… which is really aside of the times isn't it? 

00:12:50
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:12:50
PATRICIA ROBEY So it's not just about that intimacy one-on-one kind of sexual role, but also now when a lot of people are doing online counseling and so on they've had to add that that they have to really maintain that boundary and that's a very difficult thing. 

00:13:05
SHANNON DERMER I'm glad that's a topic you're going to be discussing because I think it isn't discussed very often, and it's easy for you, your clients to have romantic feelings for you because you're intensely paying attention to them for about 50 minutes you know each week or each time you meet. But also that sometimes clients whether it's romantic or friends that you know sometimes they're people who if we didn't meet as a client, we might have been friends with them or dated them in real life, and you're having this intense relationship, and it's hard sometimes not to have… that feeling of connection that goes beyond just the counseling connection sometimes, but I think supervisees are afraid to bring that up if they're having those feelings. 

00:13:45
PATRICIA ROBEY Right. There really has to be a trust in the supervisee… 

00:13:50
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:13:50
PATRICIA ROBEY Supervisor relationship for somebody to bring that it's a very tough one. And so it requires courage you're right. And you know the interesting thing that you mentioned about these relationships and about how they extend there is also ACA has a way of managing and maintaining boundaries even after sessions are over. And you mentioned friending. And so this is where aspirational ethics come into because there is a suggestive limit of five years before you begin a romantic relationship. 

00:14:20
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:14:20
PATRICIA ROBEY So that's the mandate as you wait that long. The aspirational piece is do you ever believe that there can be a romantic relationship or even in a friending relationship or a business relationship once the counseling relationship is over, can you ever come to this kind of relationship with somebody that you've already counseled or is there always a hierarchy and so that's… 

00:14:50
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:14:50
PATRICIA ROBEY difficult because I know, I don't know about you, but I've met many people that I thought if I'd met you somewhere else we could have been friends. 

00:14:55
SHANNON DERMER Oh absolutely. And I think it also, it depends on lot of things was it a three time career counseling session or was it you know two years of intensive you know exchanges of intensive counseling. You know I think there is… there is differences but there is always I think going to be somewhat of that that hierarchy. And you know we can discuss that more later when we debrief later to debrief as in talk no boundary violations that since we've been talking about a sexual topic or a romantic feeling not necessarily a sexual. I think there is a wide continuum where people can have crushes on us you know. But any of that is, like you'd mentioned earlier the slippery slope. And I want to see if there is a few more things you want to get to, but I just, I was a big Friends fan and I think a lot of people would know the show Friends that there actually was a… an episode and I'd like to show in ethics classes where Phoebe starts to have a crush on one of her massage clients. And she is talking about the ethics you're not supposed to date massage clients. But you know the, his head goes in that little donut hole so we can see his feet when she's massaging his back. So she's like would paint her toes when he was coming and she would schedule him as the last client of the day and give him extra time and it was this slippery slope that… it just started out as oh she liked him as a client. And then it moved toward more romantic feelings that she started to recognize in herself and had to make some decisions about it, yeah. 

00:16:20
PATRICIA ROBEY Hmm-hmm. Yeah, I remember that. I remember when Harrison Ford and Indiana Jones were the student head you know "Love you" and her eyelids closed up. But those are those relationships that really kind of causes a little bit of grief, but they are the ones just about managing boundaries with the professional relationships. So another thing I want to talk about is you know how do you manage these things over the course of time. And once you have that kind of ethical dilemma something that we struggled with is what can you do then. And you really to address it number one is have the awareness that you are having this difficulty. 

00:17:05
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:17:05
PATRICIA ROBEY And then have the courage to bring it to supervision. And so there is a lot of these boundary challenges that could be brought up. So for example, bartering which is ironic because you think, 

00:17:15
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:17:20
PATRICIA ROBEY Who is going to barter for services? 

00:17:20
SHANNON DERMER But it's a very cultural thing. 

00:17:20
PATRICIA ROBEY It is. And it's fraught with danger. 

00:17:25
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:17:25
PATRICIA ROBEY Because… if you trade painting my bedroom for counseling services what if you do a bad job, what if I do a bad job. You know and so there is a lot of difficulty with that. You mentioned small town interactions. I remember one of our colleagues lives in a small town and he was saying one time if I need to buy a car and I don't go and buy it from my friend who is in town who is also my client how is that going to impact our relationship. 

00:17:50
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:17:55
PATRICIA ROBEY And we mentioned gifts and cultural factors comes into play. I was at a conference a couple of years ago in Canada and someone that I had trained in South Africa was at that conference. And so I had as a gift because I was presenting they give us a little maple syrup container. And I said to him, do you like maple syrup, and he says, I don't know we've never tried it. And I said, well here I'd like to give this to you as a gift. And he said, he had those crust fallen look on his face. And he said, I cannot refuse a gift. And then I thought I think I'd haven done him a favor because now he has to take this… this thing back to South Africa whether they're going to use it, what are they going to do with it. And so that's just an example of some of the cultural things that come into play. 

00:18:40
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:18:45
PATRICIA ROBEY And also being on the receiving end, you mentioned that previously as for some cultures to give a gift is a reciprocal kind of thing that you do to honor or balance a relationship you know. 

00:18:55
SHANNON DERMER You know they can be very offended and it can really hurt their therapeutic relationship if you don't accept it. 

00:19:05
PATRICIA ROBEY So, we started to talk about what to do in those kind of situations. And the first thing that you want to do if you're going to deal with them is to identify the problem and what the issues are going to be. And once you've done that to look at the ethical codes and the laws, regulation and the… the most intense… the most restrictive law or ethical regulation is the one that you must follow. So for example, the state of Illinois has a higher level than ACA this is what you have to aspire too. And then consultation, it's always good to talk with your supervisors or even peers. Peer supervision is really helpful because sometimes I think people can say things that they wouldn't want to say and document, document, document, what you've been doing. 

00:19:55
SHANNON DERMER Yes, yes, and umm… I know we have to get to your, your mock session your mock meeting you're vignette in a minute. Is there anything else you want them to know because we'll have a discussion afterwards anything else you want the audience the people who are watching to know before they see the vignette because we need to wrap up here in a second so you can get to that. 

00:20:15
PATRICIA ROBEY Well, I think you'll see that when we're working this vignette that you'll see how we do the consultation process, brain storm courses of action, look at ethical codes, and then figure out what the client or the supervisee needs to be doing in the session. So, hopefully in this you'll see kind of that overview of the problem solving process thinking about ethics and boundary… and dual relationships in this case. 

00:20:45
SHANNON DERMER Great. Well, I'm very excited to watch your demonstration. And then you and I will meet afterwards and you kind of discuss a bit what the things you were demonstrating and just have kind of a final discussion of the Code of Ethics and Boundaries. 

00:20:55
PATRICIA ROBEY Okay, it sounds good. 

00:20:55
SHANNON DERMER Thank you.

00:21:00
SUPERVISION SESSION 

00:21:00
with Patricia Robey, Ed.D. 

00:21:00
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:21:05
PATRICIA ROBEY Well, hi, Paula, it's good to see you again. 

00:21:05
PAULA FRANKLIN Thank you. 

00:21:10
PATRICIA ROBEY You… you are for supervision. So, as usually I like to kind of transition from the busyness of what was just going on as you were rushing in. so, just take a minute, just kind of breathe in. 

00:21:15
PAULA FRANKLIN All right. 

00:21:20
PATRICIA ROBEY And breathe out. Let go of some of that stress that you might have been carrying in although you're pretty much of a peaceful person. 

00:21:25
PAULA FRANKLIN Thank you. 

00:21:30
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah. So, as always I want to check in and see how things are going in. So, where would you like to begin today? 

00:21:35
PAULA FRANKLIN Well, this week is been pretty smooth, but I have one client that kind of struggling with, so I guess I like to kind of start getting some feedback about how I should work with him? 

00:21:45
PATRICIA ROBEY Okay. Why don't you tell me a little bit of the history? 

00:21:50
PAULA FRANKLIN Well, he is, he came in for depression. 

00:21:50
PATRICIA ROBEY Hmm-hmm. 

00:21:50
PAULA FRANKLIN And I've seen him for 12 sessions now. But as things… when we first started he… he came in just kind of venting about the relationship he's had and how relationships continue to fail him. And so he's just having a hard time coping with daily you know life. And so we started talking about his relationships… and the coping skills that he's dealt with… things that he's done in the past and what he can do. And so as time continued to move forward in our sessions, I just kind of noticed his change in demeanor. 

00:22:20
PATRICIA ROBEY Hmm-hmm. 

00:22:25
PAULA FRANKLIN He started dressing differently, he started giving me compliments. You know just… I don't know he seemed happier, so I don't know I kind of thought it was just about him feeling better in the sessions, but then he would make small comments related to he and I… 

00:22:40
PATRICIA ROBEY Oh hmm-hmm. 

00:22:45
PAULA FRANKLIN versus his relationships or his depression. And so I just kind of started feeling a little awkward about that. 

00:22:50
PATRICIA ROBEY So, talk a little bit more about the awkwardness. What's happening for you in response to the client's behavior? 

00:22:55
PAULA FRANKLIN Well, I would just… I could feel myself getting intense and so it didn't as comfortable as it did in the beginning. In the beginning, it felt more of me just being the counselor and getting him to share his emotions and his concerns. Now I feel a little more on the defensive. You know because of some of the comments that he says nothing out of… you know nothing inappropriate it just seems different from the norm if that make sense. He's… you know he'll… like I said he will give me compliments or he'll ask me more about how my week is going or what I do in my spare time. And just it seems more conversational as if I don't if he's hitting on me you know I don't want to actually say that if he's not hitting on me, but it just feels that way for me. 

00:23:45
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah. So tell me a little bit more about your thinking about what's going on. So, what are some of the concerns you have about this behavior? 

00:23:55
PAULA FRANKLIN Well, I don't know. I'm thinking, I'm thinking he's hitting on me. I'm thinking he's trying to flirt with me or he's trying to get to know me better. You know maybe he now has some attraction towards me. And so that's the, that's the thought that I'm getting from this entire process. And so it's causing me to feel uncomfortable and apprehensive and more defensive. So, I don't feel like I can be you know comfortable in counseling him because I'm more defensive in trying to keep up the barrier in. 

00:24:30
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah. 

00:24:30
PAULA FRANKLIN And maintain my ethical boundaries in this relationship. 

00:24:35
PATRICIA ROBEY When you thought about bringing this case to me to talk about what were you hoping would have as a result of our discussion? 

00:24:40
PAULA FRANKLIN Just…I don't know maybe get some suggestion on what I should be doing or if there was anything I'm doing wrong in the session to kind of point that out in case if there is something I'm not seeing because I do know that it's easy to cross boundaries unexpectedly. So, hopefully as I share the scenario if there is anything that I am doing that's, that's not, you know, that is a boundary crosser to kind of let of me know, so that for the future sessions I'll know to pull back a little bit. 

00:25:15
PATRICIA ROBEY Okay, so that's kind of what's you might ask, are we kind of inching over… 

00:25:15
PAULA FRANKLIN Am I inching over… 

00:25:15
PATRICIA ROBEY into something else. And what if any role you might be playing… 

00:25:20
PAULA FRANKLIN Right. 

00:25:20
PATRICIA ROBEY in this. So, what's the answer to that when you kind of sit back little bit and think about your relationship with the client and how you've been working together what might you have done if anything and there could be nothing to this, but what do you think might have led to this? 

00:25:40
PAULA FRANKLIN Well, that's what I have been thinking about. I think I've kept ethics on the forefront of my thinking since… since I felt this. So, even for example he brought me flowers. And when he brought the flowers, immediately I'm thinking I don't want to accept any gifts from you know from him. But then he you know he told me they were free they came from his mother's garden. And so I did accept them, but I said I'll wait them in our waiting room so that everybody can enjoy them. So, I tried to keep it very open you know didn't want to make it too personal. And so examples like that is what I try and stay in front of so that I don't cross the boundary, but, so what I'm doing is just trying to keep an awareness. 

00:26:30
PATRICIA ROBEY Okay. 

00:26:30
PAULA FRANKLIN Of, of that invisible line. And so I'm trying not to cross it. I don't think I have crossed it, but I'm wondering should I have even accepted the flowers at all or should I have made a session about not bringing gifts. That's just were you know I kind of get confused about. 

00:26:45
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah, yeah and you're afraid at this point it's going to escalate into something else? 

00:26:45
PAULA FRANKLIN Yeah. 

00:26:50
PATRICIA ROBEY So let me ask you a question just thinking about that from an ethical perspective and what you know about ethics. When is it okay to accept a gift and when is it not okay? 

00:27:00
PAULA FRANKLIN Well, based on my understanding, it is… it's I wouldn't accept a gift of monetary value. But in terms of it would depend on their reasoning behind giving it to me. If it's a gesture of thankfulness then I have accepted it, but I also discuss it you know in terms of letting them know you don't have to give a gift to tell me that you're grateful or that you're thinking. But sometimes culturally I have realized that people feel that giving that gift is very important to them so I don't want to minimize that. 

00:27:35
PATRICIA ROBEY Right. 

00:27:35
PAULA FRANKLIN So I just kind of bring it into the conversation, but I also look at the, the means behind why they chose to give me a gift. 

00:27:40
PATRICIA ROBEY So that's kind of a couple of consideration as you think about what's going on. So I'm wondering if you had a conversation with him about the meaning behind the gift. 

00:27:55
PAULA FRANKLIN Once he gave it me I… I introduced the topic. I don't think I went into it enough because when it kind of caught me off guard. 

00:28:05
PATRICIA ROBEY Right, so as things usually do? 

00:28:05
PAULA FRANKLIN It does. So, I did introduce that you know you don't have to do this, this is anything that I'm expecting from you. But he was persistent in trying to share with me. And so that's when I did kind of relax a little and I did accept it, so that I wouldn't offend him in anyway. And I thought by saying I'll put it in the waiting room if we moved myself from the personal aspect of it, but then you know he still came back in and asked me even if I would go out with him. 

00:28:35
PATRICIA ROBEY Oh. 

00:28:35
PAULA FRANKLIN You know asked… telling me that his birthday was coming up and then he would be alone if you know if he, he didn't have any other plans and then what if I come out for dinner with him for his birthday. So now I'm feeling like you know, I am staying for me accepting the flowers. So, I felt like it began to escalate. 

00:28:50
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah, yeah. 

00:28:50
PAULA FRANKLIN Just because of that. So, then I again felt like how do I adjust this now because now we're at a higher level than we were at the first. 

00:29:00
PATRICIA ROBEY And so now you're talking about a difficult… different ethical code that's coming into play with him inviting you out. 

00:29:05
PAULA FRANKLIN Right. 

00:29:05
PATRICIA ROBEY And what ethical code would that be? 

00:29:10
PAULA FRANKLIN Well, now he's trying to get more personal and crossing boundaries in terms of what would look like a romantic relationship, so going from a counselor to a romantic situation. And so I initially… he asked me at a very end of a session. So I'm initially thinking I don't want to do this, but at the end I didn't have time to share my concerns and for us to open a discussion about that. So I just kind of told him we'll talk about it next week. And so I haven't met him since, so I'm wanting to kind of… 

00:29:35
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah. 

00:29:35
PAULA FRANKLIN Get some feedback from you in terms of how to address this because I'm not wanting to cross that boundary, but I don't want to offend him or hurt any work that we've done in our counseling sessions. 

00:29:50
PATRICIA ROBEY And there and lies the real struggle right? Well, I appreciate very much that you're bringing it to supervision. And, but says about our relationship is that you have trust and confidence that we'll work together for your best… best solution to this and that's the appropriate way to deal with these things always. So, as he was leaving and he asked you do this and go out with him on his birthday did you say? 

00:30:15
PAULA FRANKLIN Right. 

00:30:20
PATRICIA ROBEY So I wonder inside of yourself if you had any mixed feelings at all about the invitation? 

00:30:25
PAULA FRANKLIN They were not mixed because I wanted to say no. So, I guess in terms of accepting they were not, but in terms of being a professional and addressing it in the most ethical manner then yes I had mixed feelings because I'm kind of stuck on how to address it and maintain the boundary. But at the same time be his professional counselor and the person he can continue to trust and confide. 

00:30:55
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah, so he's coming in soon you haven't discussed this yet? 

00:31:00
PAULA FRANKLIN Right. 

00:31:00
PATRICIA ROBEY And you like to have some ideas in place. So instinctively what… how do you think he might approach this? 

00:31:10
PAULA FRANKLIN Probably at the beginning of the session actually bring it up. You know last week right before we ended you asked me about going out with you for your birthday and then just kind of let him know I want to talk about that for a moment. And then I'm stuck so… 

00:31:25
PATRICIA ROBEY Well, why don't we role play it? 

00:31:25
PAULA FRANKLIN Okay. 

00:31:30
PATRICIA ROBEY Okay. And just throw some things out and then see how it feels to you because I think sometimes that role play helps to get you in your head a little bit about what you might actually do just like driver's had how should understand how to run the road. 

00:31:40
PAULA FRANKLIN Okay that makes sense. 

00:31:40
PATRICIA ROBEY So, I'm your client, so just try some things and see what might be workable for you because you have to own this right? 

00:31:50
PAULA FRANKLIN Right. 

00:31:50
PATRICIA ROBEY Right. 

00:31:55
PAULA FRANKLIN All right. Let's see. Well, last week we ended where before… well before our session ended, you asked me if I wanted to go out with you for your birthday in about two weeks. And then we had to end so I didn't actually get to address it, so I want to address that with you now. I do appreciate that you asked me you know that you feel comfortable enough with me to want me to celebrate something as important as your birthday with you. But I do feel that as your counselor it is not appropriate for me to go out with you outside of our counseling sessions. So I just want to know how that feels for me to say that to you? It does that just kind of share what you think in my saying in my declining you invitation. 

00:32:45
PATRICIA ROBEY Okay. So… so that's a nice lead in and you're putting it right on the line. How do you think the client will respond to that? 

00:32:55
PAULA FRANKLIN He'll probably say why you know why not. 

00:33:00
PATRICIA ROBEY Okay so why, why not. 

00:33:00
PAULA FRANKLIN It's just friendly gesture. 

00:33:00
PATRICIA ROBEY It's a friendly gesture. 

00:33:05
PAULA FRANKLIN So now me… I'll probably say um…… 

00:33:10
PATRICIA ROBEY You just say so why, why not, really it was just a friendly gesture. 

00:33:15
PAULA FRANKLIN Well, I prefer to maintain our professional relationship. And I know it is a friendly gesture. It just moves us to the realm of being client and counselor to two friends and I prefer to stay client and counselor. I don't know if that sounds too harsh. 

00:33:30
PATRICIA ROBEY How are you feeling as you're saying that? 

00:33:35
PAULA FRANKLIN That I don't want to say that, but it's just lack of… lack of better statement. 

00:33:40
PATRICIA ROBEY So I have an idea. 

00:33:40
PAULA FRANKLIN Okay. 

00:33:40
PATRICIA ROBEY Okay, so you're to the point where you're, you're talking about that initial statement that you had was a very strong, but a emphatic statement. I appreciate that you want that, but there is a line. But the other thing is that I would like to consider is how do you… you know you talked about the meaning behind the flowers and how you made the decision that that was okay. What do you think the, or the client ultimately wants from asking you well, but as a client I mean what did he come in for counseling for, what is happening that the clients wants maybe in the bigger picture? 

00:34:20
PAULA FRANKLIN I think that because he initially entered having difficulty in maintaining relationships and coming from a breakup that he now feels comfortable enough with me and thinking that either I like her as a person I would start a relationship with or there is something about her that I see in terms of who I would like as a partner does that make sense. You know he sees something in me that's now sparking his desire to reinitiate relationships. 

00:34:50
PATRICIA ROBEY Okay. So in the larger picture, the client came in wanting to get over a bad relationship and reach to start his life. And so you're thinking that maybe his intention behind this… this offer to go out is to start that new relationship, so maybe that's the meaning behind it. 

00:35:10
PAULA FRANKLIN That's what I'm thinking. 

00:35:10
PATRICIA ROBEY So if that's how that you understand the client, I'm wondering if some questions for the client about what are your looking for when you think about you know inviting me out what would you like in the bigger picture for your life that maybe we can help move you in that direction of companionship or whatever it is you really wants. 

00:35:35
PAULA FRANKLIN So asking him what is he… he's looking for? 

00:35:35
PATRICIA ROBEY What do you think? 

00:35:40
PAULA FRANKLIN I mean I think that would make sense just because just when you asked me, it made me reflect on how I am seeing the bigger picture. So if I ask him what is it he's looking for, it'll… have the same effect and having him to reflect on the bigger picture and I feel like he would say you know I'm looking for someone who listens to me or someone who talks to me is kindly or you know is openly as you do you know because I see that so I see that he would share some of those comments. And that would be an opportunity of us to continue the counseling. 

00:36:10
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah, yeah. 

00:36:10
PAULA FRANKLIN Kind of move away from the dinner. 

00:36:15
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah, right. 

00:36:15
PAULA FRANKLIN Move into the counseling of what he is looking for in a relationship. 

00:36:20
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah, so let's go back then. So you've told me, you've told the client I appreciate the offer, but there is this boundary and you said that very nicely. And so then he says to you well it was just a friendly gesture whatever, so what's the next response then based on what we were just talking about? And a potential response… 

00:36:40
PAULA FRANKLIN Yeah. 

00:36:40
PATRICIA ROBEY It doesn't have to be in storm, but just kind of a practice saying it. 

00:36:45
PAULA FRANKLIN Okay. I probably… well I'll just say it let's see… let me think for a second. Well, with it being you know a friendly gesture are there any other people that you would also like to extend that offer too. Is there anyone else in your life that is equally is friendly or nice to you. I don't know if that… 

00:37:10
PATRICIA ROBEY That what you suggest to say. 

00:37:10
PAULA FRANKLIN No. 

00:37:15
PATRICIA ROBEY No. 

00:37:15
PAULA FRANKLIN That's why I'm asking you. 

00:37:15
PATRICIA ROBEY So okay. So let me, let me tell you what I might say and you can do this or not, but I understand and appreciate that you invited me out. But what I really I am getting from you is that what you're looking for is someone who could be a companion to you or somebody that you could have relationship with outside of our relationship. And so it's not going to work because of us because of the boundary issues. However, I really will like to work with you on helping you to set a goal and set a plan of action for how you can start to create a network where you can have friends and socialize, would you be interested in something like that? 

00:38:00
PAULA FRANKLIN I like that. That flowed so well. That does and I could see him responding to that and I see how it moves the counseling session. 

00:38:05
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah, so… because you don't want to get stuck in that oh yeah but yeah but and he's a little bit embarrassed probably because he's turning him down. But to look at the deeper meaning and then move forward and have you drawn that line, but you don't have to worry about it and you just start to move in the direction that's what he wanted it initially when he came into counseling right? 

00:38:25
PAULA FRANKLIN Right. 

00:38:30
PATRICIA ROBEY Was to figure out a way to get over the relationship and start new. 

00:38:30
PAULA FRANKLIN Right. 

00:38:35
PATRICIA ROBEY So that sounded good to you? 

00:38:35
PAULA FRANKLIN It did, it did because it sound… I mean it was… it sounds sincere moving forward you know not just lying… not lying to him or making up anything, but I think it continues the path of the therapeutic relationships. And that's what I was wanting to do without throwing it off, without embarrassing you know, him without causing him to discontinue his treatment, it just, it sounded smooth enough to continue the transition. 

00:39:05
PATRICIA ROBEY Okay. And this idea is something that you can generalize to other sessions because these kind of things happen. 

00:39:05
PAULA FRANKLIN Right. 

00:39:10
PATRICIA ROBEY Where people come in and they kind of push the boundary because that is such an intimate relationship that we have. 

00:39:15
PAULA FRANKLIN Right. 

00:39:15
PATRICIA ROBEY With our counselees you know. So we just have a few minutes left with our time together, so thinking about that… how you're going to move on with this client, so what's your next step then for the next session? 

00:39:30
PAULA FRANKLIN I will reintroduce the, the invitation. And once he brings it up again or once we begin to talk about it and I decline, I will let him know why I'm declining in terms of maintaining our professional relationship. And then kind of asking him what we just talked about in terms of what is it that he is wanting from this dinner and what's the big picture that he is trying to get. And if he… if he has a difficulty with the words in the same way that I did, then even asking him kind of bringing it back to our first few sessions in terms of well you originally told me that you have difficulty in relationships and you're looking for someone who A, B and C you know listens to me, talks to me, and so it sounds like this is what you're wanting from someone… 

00:40:15
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah. 

00:40:20
PAULA FRANKLIN Outside of a counseling session. And just kind of moving it forward that way and talking about the things that he's looking for in a session and how we can go about moving in that direction. 

00:40:30
PATRICIA ROBEY Okay. And as you say that what is your emotionally physiological response to this, so… how are you feeling now? 

00:40:40
PAULA FRANKLIN Relaxed. 

00:40:40
PATRICIA ROBEY Relaxed? 

00:40:40
PAULA FRANKLIN More relaxed. 

00:40:40
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah. 

00:40:40
PAULA FRANKLIN Yes, because it was very tensed. 

00:40:45
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah, yeah. 

00:40:45
PAULA FRANKLIN At first in terms of not knowing what to do, not wanting to, to step across the line, but now I guess the line seems brighter now. 

00:40:50
PATRICIA ROBEY You know… that's good. 

00:40:50
PAULA FRANKLIN It's clear. 

00:40:55
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah. 

00:40:55
PAULA FRANKLIN In terms of that ethical boundary and that I'm, and I'm very confident that I'm not crossing it and that I am maintaining the professionalism at the same time. 

00:41:00
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah, yeah. 

00:41:05
PAULA FRANKLIN So, it feels more relaxed and… 

00:41:05
PATRICIA ROBEY And that's what you want for you right? 

00:41:05
PAULA FRANKLIN Exactly. 

00:41:05
PATRICIA ROBEY And I know you got it, got it in you because you already demonstrating fine counseling and a real genuine care and which is… what leads in this direction right? 

00:41:15
PAULA FRANKLIN Right. 

00:41:15
PATRICIA ROBEY Well… so I'm glad that you're feeling better. And I see our time is basically finished for today. I'm going to really look forward to hearing you next week. 

00:41:25
PAULA FRANKLIN Yes. 

00:41:25
PATRICIA ROBEY About how this goes and just being mindful, when you work with this client consider that your ultimate direction he wants to go and the limitations of your relationships, but sounds like you have a good plan for a success. 

00:41:35
PAULA FRANKLIN Thank you. 

00:41:40
PATRICIA ROBEY And good luck to you with that. 

00:41:40
PAULA FRANKLIN Thank you. 

00:41:40
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah, you're welcome.

PROFESSIONAL ORIENTATION/ETHICS: 

00:41:45
ETHICAL DILEMMAS: BOUNDARY ISSUES 

00:41:45
WRAP-UP 

00:41:45
with Patricia Robey, Ed.D. 

00:41:45
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:41:50
SHANNON DERMER Thank you for doing that demonstration. I think that you both did excellent job. What were some of the things that you wanted us to learn from that vignette? 

00:42:00
PATRICIA ROBEY Well, several things that I went through when we're talking about it before at the end about the consultation process in particular. I think that my goal was to not just show a demonstration, but also to show how you might think through what was going on and that's why I wanted to do in that way. As counselors and counselors in training, I think that learning how to think about what's happening as well as what to do is that's two parts you know two halves of the coin right. And so in that demonstration I wanted to show that it's an opportunity to teach the, the trainee about ethics and be sure that she knew I tried to draw from her. And she was at a more advanced level. You know in earlier training, I might have been more direct in terms of well here are the X. But truthfully you know everyone's taken ethics courses. 

00:42:55
SHANNON DERMER That's true. 

00:42:55
PATRICIA ROBEY And so I do like to draw from rather than be the person who gives the information from the outside in because I think that experiential struggling through is part of that learning journey. 

00:43:10
SHANNON DERMER Well, and she, I mean she's pretty insightful and you're also a pretty I think easy supervisor you know that you do you do make them feel comfortable and safe. And so you're doing the content for her and the content for the client, but then also taking that meta postion of stepping back and look at the whole therapeutic system and what was going on. And then also as you said you're… you also highlighted what was going on for her as a person not you know what was she feeling physiologically as well as how was she processing it. What was your purpose in doing that? 

00:43:50
PATRICIA ROBEY Well, that happened. Well there was two things. There was how she felt personally in response to the client's overtures because we bring a lot of ourselves into our sessions whether it's feeling empathy toward the person or whatever because sometimes that's a push pull. 

00:44:00
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:44:05
PATRICIA ROBEY You know… but I feel for this guy it's his birthday do I extend you know but she didn't say anything about that. So that's not an issue for her. But the other piece I think, at the end I wanted to address that because there is hereby he tells you your emotional response tells you if you're on the right track. If she didn't have that sense of kind of relief, I would know that we needed to work a little bit more with it because it was something else hanging. And so I would have asked her you know so you're not quite comfortable yet. So what else do we need to be doing to help you move in that direction? 

00:44:40
SHANNON DERMER Okay. Do you think the processing for you as a supervisor would have been any different if it was a male supervisee with a female client? And their physiological reactions can be a little bit different if they're feeling attracted to somebody? 

00:44:55
PATRICIA ROBEY No, I think that's pretty much the way I operate and because it's an inside out kind of process that I believe in I would asked the questions. And then my expectation would be that a counselor or counselor in training would have some insight an awareness into his own process if that were the case. And it doesn't have to be a male or a female, it can be the same sex relationships you just never know where these kind of things come into play. And… so the process kind of is the process and I think for me what's always important no matter who I'm working with is the relationship that we have. So… and thank you for that comment about safely because I really believe that that's what leads to disclosure and risk taking like Paula did in this session and openness than to learn and to grow in the process. 

00:45:55
SHANNON DERMER Okay, now I'm not very aware if clients have a crush or anything on me that, but I remember one time when I was a trainee I had… we did… we did team cases where there were people behind the mirror the window and they were my team. And they had commented to me one time where I was meeting with the father and son that they thought the father had a crush on me. And I was like no what you're not you know no way. And it wasn't anything that really in a feared with the processed he wasn't bringing presents, he wasn't, you know doing a lot of things that were in this vignette. But what if your supervisee had less insight than that supervisee in the vignette that or what if your supervisee was upset about you bringing up this kind of topic? 

00:46:50
PATRICIA ROBEY Well, I would ask what's going on inside of you right now that's creating this response what are you thinking right now so let's just talk about that. So instead of operating on more emotional level I will go to a cognitive level because it's often safer for people to start. And then just tell me what your thoughts and then work from there because sometimes you're right. There is first of all lack of insight for some people and then let's look at the information, let's look at your videos you know and so there might be some ways what you think is happening. So there is a lot of different techniques that you can use to draw… to draw and develop insight depending on level. 

00:47:30
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. When I think there is… you know we're talking somewhat about boundary violation, but there is a continuum of boundary relationship there is just a thing where you kind of know that what do you do you just kind of like your client. You know we're talking about in the beginning where gosh we hadn't met this way we would be friends, but it's not really affecting the process or you know a client might like you but it's not really affecting the process all the way to your client being kind of aggressive about the boundary violation to and actual relationship occurring outside of a sexual or a romantic relationship occurring online as you mentioned or outside of the session or… so how would things change or would they change if you felt like not your supervisee, but that the client was being aggressive about their feelings or about boundary violations? 

00:48:25
PATRICIA ROBEY And how would I feel about that in terms of supervising or how would I deal with that or… 

00:48:30
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. Well, I'll give an example. Like one time I was supervising someone where the male client would make a lot of comments to this young female attractive supervisee about well like well if you were my girlfriend or things like that and then later on he started to he asked her if he could tape record the sessions back when they used to tape recorders tape record the session. And it wasn't like he wanted to tape record the session we didn't feel like because he wanted to listen to it later and learned from it. We felt there was like a sexual overtone to… he wanted to hear her voice and he would ask her out like do you want to go to coffee and she would kindly say, no I can't do that you know, but he started to up the… what he wanted to do in terms of boundary violations as he went on. And eventually I had to help her to very directly you know have a conversation about that. So I was just wondering how your supervision style might change or what you might direct your supervisee to do if boundary violation were either like more serious or escalating in someway? 

00:49:35
PATRICIA ROBEY Well, yes. I agree with you when you said that you talk with or tell your supervisee to me more direct. There are times when you can't gentle someone through these situations. 

00:49:45
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:49:50
PATRICIA ROBEY Especially if they are being aggressive. But also to you know… and sometimes that maybe that finally you have to say I think that our sessions are not in your are no longer in your best interest. And so what I'm going to do is to refer you to somebody who I think can give services that will be more useful for you. Or sometimes you just have to say that say you know the client is well the aggressive and almost… 

00:50:15
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:50:15
PATRICIA ROBEY Abusive toward the counselor you know there is a point where we take care of ourselves as well. 

00:50:20
SHANNON DERMER Yes. and that's actually I think sometimes counselors especially counselors who are in training forget that sometimes that there is a point where you know we always hold the counseling relationship and client in such a reverence as we should, but there does come a point where you have to protect yourself also. 

00:50:35
PATRICIA ROBEY That's right. 

00:50:40
SHANNON DERMER Whether that's from romantic overtures or physical, you know more physically aggressive overtures or things you know someone making accusations against you that there does come a point we have to protect yourself as a professional. 

00:50:55
PATRICIA ROBEY And I, and again this is where supervision, documentation, consultation all comes into play so that you have that in the client file what the issues were, what you did about them, and because some of those things could lead into you know legal issues or whatever because people who are rest of that way you don't know where it's going to go. So that's the other thing always documentation, document whatever is going on. 

00:51:20
SHANNON DERMER Right. As lawyers would say it doesn't exist if you didn't document it. 

00:51:25
PATRICIA ROBEY That's right that's right. 

00:51:25
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. So, so some self-reflection looking at how you feel looking at the process from the client's point of view, the supervisee's point of view, as a therapeutic kind of meta looking at the whole process, so documenting in, in notes always looking at the code of ethics and was there something else I missed in there… so something else consultation it doesn't have to be just he your supervisor, it can be consulting with other people. And as I remind people too that you have your insurance you can always consult if it's a larger boundary violation not only with your supervisor, but also with the lawyer through your insurance. I mean you always hope it doesn't get to that level, but that's what they're they are there for the mal practice insurance. 

00:52:10
PATRICIA ROBEY That's right that's right. In consultation, you can often get consultation for free before things go into a really glad bad place. 

00:52:20
SHANNON DERMER But I think you're trying to help your supervisees you try to deal things with things in an honest authentic relationship building way before… if you can before it gets those levels. 

00:52:30
PATRICIA ROBEY And I have to say that what I told her to do is what I would do if I were in that situation myself. 

00:52:35
SHANNON DERMER Excellent. 

00:52:40
PATRICIA ROBEY And I have done, those things come up. 

00:52:40
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:52:40
PATRICIA ROBEY You know we have to kind of prepared and role play is helpful. 

00:52:45
SHANNON DERMER Well, thank you so much for sharing your expertise with us as an educator and a supervisor and just as an all around nice person.
