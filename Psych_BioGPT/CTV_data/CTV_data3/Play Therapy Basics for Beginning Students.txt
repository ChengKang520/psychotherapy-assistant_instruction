00:00:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Hello, my name is Dr. Jennifer Baggerly. Based on my extensive training, experience, and research, I've seen solid evidence that play therapy helps children resolve emotional, social, and psychological difficulties caused by a typical developmental problems such as fighting or separation anxiety. Upsetting family changes such as divorce or death or traumatic experiences such abuse or natural disasters. These are my puppets, Shep the sheepdog and Sugarloaf. Come bounce with us into the basics of play therapy and learn the basics skills of this powerful approach to treating children. 

00:01:25
SHEP  Let's start with defining play therapy. 

00:01:35
SUGARLOAF How do you play therapy? 

00:01:35
SHEP Surely Sugarloaf, you're not playing therapy, you participate in play therapy. 

00:01:40
SUGARLOAF What is play therapy? 

00:01:45
SHEP Play therapy is a way of using toys to counsel children just like therapist use talk to counsel adults, play therapist use toys to counsel children. 

00:01:50
SUGARLOAF  So they just sit there and watch them play? 

00:01:55
SHEP Well, Sugarloaf, from a child's perspective, there might be what it seems like. But just like a doctor has in-depth knowledge of physiology in medicine, when she ask questions and then writes something on a piece of paper, a play therapist has in-depth knowledge of child development, psychology, and therapeutic principles and procedures to help heal a child's heart and soul. 

00:02:20
SUGARLOAF Oh, so it is more than just playing. 

00:02:25
SHEP Yes, Sugarloaf. Let's check out the Association For Play Therapists' definition of play therapy. APT defines it as, "The systematic use of a theoretical model to establish an interpersonal process wherein trained play therapists use the therapeutic powers of play to help clients prevent or resolve psychosocial difficulties and achieve optimal growth and development." 

00:02:50
SUGARLOAF Well, that sounds pretty complicated. Can you break it down for me, Shep? 

00:02:55
SHEP Sure, Sugarloaf. First, play therapists must be trained in play therapy. They use a certain theory to help guide them. Their process is to establish a relationship with the child through play. The therapeutic powers of play help the child resolve problems, then the child can grow healthy. 

00:03:15
SUGARLOAF So, what are those theories? I've heard of conspiracy theory before, is that one of them? 

00:03:20
SHEP According to the recent APT and American Counseling Association survey, most play therapists use child-centered play therapy. 

00:03:30
SUGARLOAF Child-centered? What about puppet-centered? (chuckles) 

00:03:35
SHEP Very funny, Sugarloaf. Check this out, Garry Landreth stated that Child-Centered Play Therapy is, "A dynamic interpersonal relationship between a child (or person of any age) and a therapist trained in play therapy procedures who provides selected play materials and facilitates the development of a safe relationship for the child (or person of any age) to fully express and explore self (feelings, thoughts, experiences, and behaviors) through play, the child's natural medium of communication, for optimal growth and development." 

00:04:05
SUGARLOAF  Oh, now I get it. Play therapy is about the relationship. Play materials like toys and puppets help build that relationship, help the child communicate and learn ways to get better. 

00:04:20
SHEP Yeah, Sugarloaf. You got it. Now, let's bounce on. 

00:04:25
Rationale for Play Therapy 

00:04:25
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  What are the reasons for providing play therapy? There are four important reasons. The first reason for providing play therapy is that play is widely recognized as a most developmentally appropriate approach for children. Children do not have the same cognitive ability such as, as adults. Piaget found that children do not develop formal operations or the cognitive ability for abstract thinking and reasoning untill about, about the age of 12. Piaget said that play bridges the gap between concrete experience and abstract thought. The second reason for providing play therapy is that there's meaning in children's play. Play is a natural language of children. Landreth said that toys our children's words and play is their language. Children frequently use dolls or toys as their words to communicate what occurs in their household. For example, one three-year-old girl was playing with the mommy doll and the daddy doll and the baby doll in the playhouse. She took the daddy doll and half the furniture and moved it outside the playhouse. Then she made the baby doll run around the house yelling, "Daddy! Daddy! Where are you?" So what do you think was happening in the child's world? Yes, her parents were in the middle of a divorce. Children often repeatedly re-enact a specific traumatic event in their play. Many children who witnessed the September 11th terrorist attacks in New York repeatedly built two towers with blocks. Flew planes into them and use army men to dig through the fallen blocks. Children play out their stories in an attempt to master these frightening images. They not stop their posttraumatic play until they reach an emotional understanding of their experience. Play therapists help children develop this needed emotional understanding. The third reason for providing play therapy is a growing evidence-based that play therapy is an effective treatment in resolving a variety of children's problems. Research demonstrates that play therapy has decreased symptoms in children who experienced school adjustment difficulties and from various traumatic events such as domestic violence, sexual abuse, death of a family member, homelessness, and natural disasters. Ray and Bratton's Meta-Analysis of 94 Play Therapy studies showed that there was a large positive effect of 0.80 on treatment outcomes indicating substantial change in children. The fourth reason for po, providing play therapy is simply that children love to participate in play therapy. From a child's perspective, that's boring and aggravating to sit in the office with the counselor who just talks to them. Counselors also find this frustrating. On the other hand, children enjoy coming to play therapy. 

00:07:40

00:07:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Let's bounce into the basic principles of play therapy. In order to make sense of basic skills, it's essential to establish a developmentally-appropriate view of children and guiding principles. Garry Landreth highlighted some important views of children. First, children are not miniature adults. Some people treat children as if they were little adults. For example, some counselors expect a five-year-old to explain why she keeps kicking her foster parent. Children are unique and worthy of respect. Some children are slow like an elephant and some children are fast like a cheetah. Each child has unique personality and different experiences and needs respect and acceptance for who, he or she is as a person. Next, children have an inherent tendency toward growth and maturity. They desire to grow as strong and belong. This desire maybe mass by disruptive attitudes and behaviors, but the potential is still there. Children will take the therapeutic process to where they need to be. Children have their own sense of when and how they will address the issue. Much of these depends on their sense of safety. Rushing the process will only delay the process. Play therapists must create a safe environment provi, by providing three core therapeutic conditions. Carl Rogers identified these core conditions as: First, Genuineness or congruence. Not having a facade but openly being the attitude and experiences expressed in the moment. Second, Warmth or Unconditional Positive Regard. An outgoing positive feeling without judgment and prizing the child as he is. Third, Empathy. Sensing and communicating the feelings and personal meanings that the child is experiencing in each moment. Virginia Axline expanded these core conditions to children through her eight basic principles which are listed in your manual. 

00:09:50
Axline's (1969) Eight Basic Principles 1. Warm, friendly relationship 2. Accept the child as is 3. Feeling of permissiveness 4. Reflect feelings 5. Trust ability to solve own problems 6. Do not direct actions 7. Do not hurry 8. Set only needed limits 

00:09:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Spend some time reviewing these principles. Identify two that may be easy for you and two that may be difficult for you to implement. For example, many beginning play therapists need a lot of practice on principle six which says, "The therapist does not attempt to direct the child's actions or conversation in any manner." The child leads the way, the therapist follows. 

00:10:15
Basic Skills 

00:10:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Axline's principles are implemented through some basic play therapy skills. These non-directive but active child-centered play therapy skills are used in individual and small group play therapy sessions. I'll explain them and then demonstrate each skill. 

00:10:40
[sil.] 

00:10:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  First, create a safe, inviting playroom by selecting, not collecting toys. Ideally, therapist will have a separate playroom with low shelves, bright colors and pictures hung at the child's eye level. This communicates that it's, it is a place for children. However, some therapist do not have the budget or consistent space to do this. So, just start out with the basic play therapy kit and gradually add items as funding permits. How do you select toys? Garry Landreth recommends three categories of toys. The first category is real-life toys such as doll families that match the ethnicity of the children that you'll be working with, baby dolls and bottles, dishes, toy cellphones, money, and a medical kit. Think of all that the child can express through playing with this baby doll. The second category is acting out or aggressive release toys such as the bop bag, toy soldiers, jungle and zoo animals such as an alligator or shark, rubber knife, dart gun, Lone Ranger mask, hand cuffs and a Nerf ball. Just think what children can express with these handcuffs. The third category is creative expression or emotional release toys such as Play-Doh, crayons, paper, costume jewelry, blocks, a small sand tray and a bottled water. Just think what children can express with Play-Doh. 

00:12:25
[sil.] 

00:12:25
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  The second basic skill is tracking behavior. Child-centered play therapist often begin the first play session with the statement such as, "In here, you can play with all the toys in most of the ways you would like." From that moment on, play therapist track a child's behavior by making statements about the chi, what the child is doing, "You're standing over there, looking at all the toys." "You chose to move that car into the sand box." "You're moving that through the air right next to my head." Notice these are statements not questions. This skill helps increase the child's awareness of their behavior and their importance. Your way of tracking should match the child's actions. However, you shouldn't be like a sports announcer saying something for every move, but rather the rate ranges from 15 to 45 seconds, depending on the activity level of the child. Let's look at how I track behavior in these children. 

00:13:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Nichelle, this is our playroom and in here you can play with all the toys in most of the ways you like to. I see you have something in mind. And you found those. You're setting up two blocks. 

00:14:00
[sil.] 

00:14:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Smooching(ph) it down. Smashing it down with your strength. 

00:14:20
[sil.] 

00:14:20
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Pounding down with your fist. You got lots of different ways to smash it. 

00:14:30
MAX Yeah. 

00:14:30
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  You're squeezing that together, using your strength to get it clamp(ph) together. 

00:14:40
AMANDA This is you. 

00:14:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY And. (crosstalk) 

00:14:40
AMANDA This is what you look like. 

00:14:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Now, that's what I looked like. (chuckles) That's funny to you. You're squeezing it. (crosstalk) 

00:14:50
AMANDA This is what I looked like. 

00:14:50
JENNIFER BAGGERLY And that's what you looked like. (laughs) There we are together. Hmm, that's pretty funny. (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
AMANDA Hi. I'm closer than you. Why? Hi. I'm younger than you. Squash, squash. 

00:15:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Hmm. So one of them is squashing the other. 

00:15:05
AMANDA Now, you're flat. 

00:15:05
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Now, you made me flat. 

00:15:05
AMANDA  Now, I'm flat. 

00:15:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY And now, we're both the same. 

00:15:15
[sil.] 

00:15:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  The third basic skill is reflecting feelings and content. Whenever you see an emotion on the child's face or sensed an emotion from the child's actions or words, reflect the feeling using the same intensive level and tone in a short, simple statement such as, "You're happy, you're making those bubbles float up high," or "You're angry that you're brother spit in your birthday cake." Again, notice that it is a statement not a question. If you know enough to ask a question, then you know enough to make a statement. Making the statement helps the child feel understood and increases the child's connection between their visceral experience of the feeling and the feeling word. If you're off target, the child usually corrects you. Reflect content when the child tells you something verbally or through action. For example, the child may tell you a long story about following her mom around the store. You re, reflect the content with, "You tried to stay as close to your mom as you could." If the child uses a doll, puppet or other toy to do something, state the reflection about the toy so as to respect the child's attempt to distance herself from the action. For example, "The dog is so angry, it hit the alligator." Let's look at how I reflect feelings and content with these children. 

00:16:40
QUENTON  This stuff is cool.(crosstalk) 

00:16:45
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah. Uh hmm. You liked that stuff. It's cool. You got those. 

00:16:50
QUENTON It's(ph) five years now? (crosstalk) 

00:16:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Uh hmm. 

00:16:50
QUENTON  Cool. 

00:16:55
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY It's been five years. Whoof! A long time. 

00:17:00
QUENTON Oh! My. 

00:17:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  He's relieved to get out of jail, whoof! 

00:17:05
QUENTON You give us our church back. Never! Give us it... (crosstalk) 

00:17:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Hmm... (crosstalk) 

00:17:10
QUENTON ...never! (crosstalk) 

00:17:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY ...they're angry. 

00:17:10
QUENTON  Okay. Now, you asked for it! 

00:17:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh! You got him right there! He fell down. 

00:17:20
QUENTON Now, it's time for me to eat. God! 

00:17:25
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Hmm. Now, you have enough for you. (sigh) It's like you're enjoying your food. 

00:17:30
QUENTON Hmm. 

00:17:30
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  It's good to know. (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
QUENTON Just like I, excellent. Do you like... (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  You are satisfied. (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
QUENTON ...French fries? 

00:17:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh, thank you. 

00:17:40
QUENTON  Tell me you if you're done with that. 

00:17:45
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. Putting on those things. 

00:17:50
QUENTON Droom, droom, droom. 

00:17:55
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY And I hear a scary noise. 

00:17:55
QUENTON Droom. 

00:17:55
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Oh, Scary sound. 

00:18:00
QUENTON  (sniffles) Hey, I feel people out there. 

00:18:05
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Hmm. It's sounds kinda mean(ph). 

00:18:10
QUENTON Hey, hey, hey. Are there people up there? I hear some. 

00:18:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Hmm. That look sad. It has a sad face on it that you made. 

00:18:20
AMANDA  Uh-huh. (reenact crying) 

00:18:25
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Hmm. That's worried for some reason. 

00:18:30
AMANDA  He got, he got all scrambled up. 

00:18:35
JENNIFER BAGGERLY He's worried and upset because he got scrambled up. 

00:18:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Boom! 

00:18:40
AMANDA Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY You got it right in the middle. You're happy you got it. 

00:18:45
[sil.] 

00:18:45
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Boom! (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
AMANDA Yeah. 

00:18:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY You got it right in the middle. You're glad when you get it like you wanted. 

00:18:55
AMANDA  A little baby had a bottle. 

00:19:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Hmm, so that little baby had a bottle. 

00:19:05
AMANDA She had some blocks. Then one day, another baby came. 

00:19:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY So, another baby. 

00:19:10
AMANDA She didn't share, but she did. 

00:19:15
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh, so that little one didn't share, but the bigger one did. 

00:19:20
AMANDA So, she went aside and played with her blocks. 

00:19:25
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh, so she went and play with her blocks since the other one wasn't sharing. 

00:19:30
AMANDA But this one said, "Hey, do you wanna play balls(ph) with me?" 

00:19:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh, so... (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
AMANDA But... (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY ...wanted... (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
AMANDA ...but... (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY ...to play. (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
AMANDA ...but she said, "No, I'm doing my own." 

00:19:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Hmm. So, the other one didn't want to play with her even when she asked. She wanted to do her own thing. 

00:19:50
[sil.] 

00:19:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  The fourth basic skill is returning responsibility and facilitating creativity. Remember during the entire play therapy session, the child is in the lead and the play therapist follows. Many children are not used to this type of permissiveness and will ask you what to do. In order to return responsibility, you can say, "In here, you can decide what to do" or "Sometimes it's hard to know what to do, but you can choose to play with all these toys and most of the ways you would like." Sometimes children will ask you to do things for them that they're capable of doing themselves, such as opening a can of Play-Doh. Return responsibility to them by saying, "That's something you can try." If the child really needs help, then state, "Show me how you want me to help you" or "Show me what to do." Facilitating creativity occurs when you return to the child the responsibility of labeling, naming or using something. For example, when the child ask, "What's this?", you can reply, "In here, you can decide." If the child ask, "What's your dog's name?", state, "In here, you can name the dog." If the child ask, "What is this for?", you can reply, "You can use that in almost any way you like." These responses free the child to use their imagination and creativity. Often, children will ask you to play with them. In order to keep in them in the lead, ask, "What would you like me to do?" and "How shall I do it?" And then comply with their directions. If they say, "Act like a teacher." Try the whisper technique and whisper, "What should I say?" Let's look at how I return responsibility and facilitate creativity with these children. 

00:21:45
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  You got it back over here. You're looking at me, me, maybe you want me to do something. What would you like me to do? 

00:22:00
MAX Ah, hit the ball. 

00:22:00
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Hit the ball. Okay. Where would you like me to hit it? 

00:22:05
MAX Me. 

00:22:05
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh, to you? Okay. Uh-oh, you got it way over there. 

00:22:10
[sil.] 

00:22:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  That one's hard to get up, but you got it. 

00:22:20
MAX Where is the ball? 

00:22:20
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh, you wonder where that ball went? Hmm. Oh, you found it. 

00:22:25
AMANDA  You know, it's really hard(ph), what is this? 

00:22:30
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Hmm. You're trying to decide what that one is. It can be whatever you want it to be. 

00:22:40
AMANDA All I wanna know what is it. 

00:22:40
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY In here, you can decide. Oh, it kinda scared you, so you dropped it. 

00:22:45
[sil.] 

00:22:45
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  The fifth basic skill is encouragement. As oppose to praise, which focuses on the end product, encouragement focuses on the effort the child makes during the process. Child-centered therapist do not praise by saying, "Good" because this is evaluative and judgmental. It promotes on the external locus of evaluation. Rather, play therapist try to facilitate an internal locus of evaluation through encouraging statements such as, "You're really working hard on that." or "You know a lot about dinosaurs." Encouragement is also used after returning the responsibility to the child and asking them to try something themselves. Statements such as, "You know to put your finger right there" or "You already have half of it off." Let the child know that you are with them in the struggle and that you have faith that they can do it. If the child becomes discouraged, reflect their feeling, "You're really discouraged, but you're still trying" or perhaps, "You'll figure it out as much as you need to." Let's look at some statements of encouragement here. 

00:24:05
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh, you found those bowling pins? 

00:24:10
[sil.] 

00:24:10
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  It's like you know how to set up those bowling pins in order. Sometimes they're hard to stand up, but you got it. You worked hard and you did it. 

00:24:30
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. Count that money up. 

00:24:35
QUENTON Ten, now 20 plus 10 is 40. Forty plus one is 41. Forty-one plus 10 is, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:24:45
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Thinking hard. 

00:24:50
QUENTON fifty-one. 

00:24:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Thinking hard and adding it up. 

00:24:50
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  You got 'em in a row. Hmm, sometimes they fall down. You decided to work on them and get them back up. You got 'em up. You found some more. You're lining them up. 

00:25:20
[sil.] 

00:25:20
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  You got the ball. Hmm. It(ph) fell down, you started to try and get it back up. You got it up. And you know your fingers going those little slots and you got it. And you're looking at it. You rolled in and you got some down. 

00:25:50
AMANDA  Oh. 

00:25:55
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY You gotta way to try and get it out. Pouncing that, pounding it down, pounding, pounding. (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
AMANDA How do you get this open? 

00:26:05
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY You try to figure it out. And you got different ways of pounding the bottom and sticking your fingers in there. It's like you're working hard to get it off and to get it out. (crosstalk) 

00:26:15
AMANDA Not(ph), ah. 

00:26:20
[sil.] 

00:26:20
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  The sixth basic skill is building self-esteem. Nothing is more satisfying to a child than finally accomplishing or figuring out something on her own after a long struggle. This is a time to build the child's self-esteem by exclaiming, "You did it! You're so proud of what you did!" Notice the emphasis is, "You are proud." Not, "I am proud." "You are proud" facilitates internal locus on the evaluation, as opposed to external locus of evaluation. Building the child's self-esteem helps him trust his internal wisdom, so he will be stronger to take a stand against peers or others who try to, to sway them against his own values. Other ways to build a child's self-esteem are to reflect qualities she exhibits such as, "You're being creative with your drawing," or "You sure are strong lifting that over your head." Let's look at some ways I build self-esteem with these children. 

00:27:30
[sil.] 

00:27:30
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  You got a column right there. It's like you have a creative idea for a building. 

00:27:45
[sil.] 

00:27:45
JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Figuring out how to open it and you did it. You got it open. 

00:27:55
AMANDA  You can get this out(inaudible ). 

00:28:03
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah, you're telling yourself you can get it out. You know, if you work hard and use the things that you have, you can do it. I see you're squeezing hard. Oh, it looks like it's more difficult to get out, but you're still trying. 

00:28:20
AMANDA Eew! 

00:28:20
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY You're gonna use that to dig it out. And you got it all out. You did it. (crosstalk) 

00:28:25
AMANDA I, I did it. I know this was handy. 

00:28:30
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY You knew it would work. You're proud of yourself for figuring it out. 

00:28:30
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  I see you're blowing soft. 

00:28:35
AMANDA I made one. 

00:28:35
DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  So, you know when, oh, you made another one. You did it. You made bubbles. 

00:28:50

DR. JENNIFER BAGGERLY  The seventh basic skill is facilitating understanding and enlarging the meaning. Like adults, children seek to be understood and to find meaning in their experiences. When a child feels understood and finds meaning in a story, many emotional and behavioral difficulties may be resolved. For example, a three-year-old boy was about to be permanently removed from his day care for biting another children. In the playroom, he use the toys to play out a scene of a monster biting things because he was hungry. I facilitated understanding by saying, "The monster has reasons for biting. He's hungry. He really needs something important." I enlarge the meaning by saying, "Sometimes monsters and others bite because they don't know what else to do, but they wish they knew a better way." After several sessions, the boy transformed his play of monsters into play with the Gumby. He no longer bit children at day care. During sessions, play therapist will notice that children have a common play thing such as aggression or nurturance or safety. You can facilitate understanding of the child's needs, intentions, and play themes through statements such as, "You want to be more powerful like the monster, so you're throwing everything around to be safe." This helps the child to understand his own behavior. Then, he can find the more constructive way of feeling powerful and safe. Play therapist can enlarge the meaning of children's play by connecting the immediate "here and now" play in the play room with their experiences outside the playroom. For example, "You're finding hard to keep that monster away just like you fought hard to keep that bully at school away." Once the child seems to make meaning of their experiences same, some play therapist would provide psycho-educational activities or materials to help the child develop needed social skills. Let's see how I facilitate understanding and enlarge the meaning with these children.

JENNIFER BAGGERLY You gonna show him, you're gonna show him you're powerful and you're in-charge. 

00:37:45
Setting Therapeutic Limits 

00:37:45
JENNIFER BAGGERLY  The eighth basic skill is setting therapeutic limits. A child-centered play therapist only set limits when there is potential danger to porp, property such as cutting off the dolls hair or throwing paint on the carpet. Potential harm to a person such as shooting the play therapist with the dart gun or the child hitting their self with a stick, or if there's interruption to the play therapy session such as the child leaving before the session is finished. Landreth suggests the ACT Model for limit setting. A is for acknowledging the feeling, "I know you're angry." C is for communicating the limit, "But people are not for shooting." T is for targeting an alternative, "You can choose to shoot the bop bag or the wall." Each part is said calmly but firmly. Acknowledge the feeling, "Shontelle, I know you're feeling silly." Communicate the limit, "But the paint is not for getting on the carpet." Target an alternative, "You can choose to keep the paint on the paper or in the jar." If the child does not respond, calmly but firmly repeat the limit again. If the child does, still does not respond, state the ultimate limit by repeating the ACT and adding, "If you choose to keep shooting me, then you choose not to play with the gun the rest of this time." If the child chooses to shoot again, then state, "I see you chose not to play with the gun the rest of the time." Stand up to get the gun and put it away under your chair or outside the room. If the limit is on something can, that cannot be taken away, then state, "If you choose to keep punching the wall, then you choose to end the play session for the day or for 10 minutes," if it's at the beginning of the session. Let's see how I set limits with these children. 

00:39:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh, it looks like you wanna shoot me. But Amanda, I'm not for shooting. I know you like to but you can shoot over here or you can choose to shoot that thing again. It's kind of sad. But you decided to turn around there and shoot that. Boom! 

00:40:10
AMANDA Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
JENNIFER BAGGERLY You got it right in the middle. You're loading it up. Oh, Amanda, I know you might like to shoot me. But... (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
AMANDA I was, (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
JENNIFER BAGGERLY ...I'm not for shooting. (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
AMANDA I was just pretending. I'll just turn... (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
AMANDA ...around and shoot. 

00:40:20
JENNIFER BAGGERLY you were gonna trick me. I know you like to, but I'm not for shooting. You can choose to shoot that. And you did.(laughs) 

00:40:25
AMANDA  I know and I, and I did. 

00:40:30
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Uh-huh. So, I know it's kind of fun to shoot it over my direction. But, ah, this, I'm not for shooting. So, you can choose to shoot toward that area or over there. Oh, you find a different way. Uh hmm, you shot it right up there. I know you like to bend that but that's not for bending. You can choose to hold it or you can choose to put it on the ground. You're pointing it right there at me. 

00:40:55
AMANDA Cut. 

00:40:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY And you cut me right there on the leg. 

00:40:55
AMANDA Cut. 

00:40:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY  You cut me on the other leg. 

00:41:00
AMANDA Cut. 

00:41:00

JENNIFER BAGGERLY And you kicked it. Uh hmm. You are happy how you did that. And we have two minutes left in our play time. So, you decide on what you wanna do in two more minutes. Oh, you got that. And you're pointing it right at me. I know you like to bend that but that's not for bending. You can choose to hold it or you can choose to put it on the ground. You're pointing it right there at me. 

00:49:30
AMANDA Cut. 

00:49:30
JENNIFER BAGGERLY  And you cut me right there on the leg. 

00:49:35
AMANDA Cut. 

00:49:35
JENNIFER BAGGERLY And cut me on the other leg. 

00:49:35
AMANDA Cut. 

00:49:35
JENNIFER BAGGERLY  On my arms, too. 

00:49:40
AMANDA Cut. 

00:49:40
JENNIFER BAGGERLY And cut me right there like you're sawing me in half. (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
AMANDA Yeah. Cut. 

00:49:50
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Hmm and my arms. You feel powerful when you can do that. 

00:49:50
AMANDA  Okay. Now, I'll cut off your foot. 

00:49:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY You cut off my feet so that I can't move. 

00:50:00
AMANDA I'll cut off your shoulders. 

00:50:00
JENNIFER BAGGERLY You cut off my shoulders, too. And now you've got... (crosstalk) 

00:50:05
AMANDA And your tummy. 

00:50:05
JENNIFER BAGGERLY ...that and my tummy. So, now you're more powerful... (crosstalk) 

00:50:10
AMANDA And the head. 

00:50:10
JENNIFER BAGGERLY ...than I am. Yeah, and the head there. 

00:50:10
AMANDA It's got a little... (crosstalk) 

00:50:10
JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Uh hmm. 

00:50:15
AMANDA ...you know the Holly Holts(ph). 

00:50:15
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Uh hmm. Yeah, you, you know it would really hurt if that happens. Okay. Our play time's up for today. 

00:50:25
AMANDA So, we don't play? 

00:50:25
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah. 

00:50:25
JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Well, Shep and Sugarloaf, now that we watched these basic skills, what questions do you think people will have? 

00:50:35
SHEP  I know. I bet they're wondering when children will be finished with play therapy. 

00:50:40
JENNIFER BAGGERLY  That's a great question, Shep. Children usually go through certain stages in play therapy. At first, they just tend to explore the toys. Then, check out to see if it's a safe place where they can be who they really are. Then, they go through a working stage where they play out their concerns by re-enacting their story with the toys. They tend to start with generalized negative emotions and they go on to specific negative and positive emotions. In the final stage, children usually move to more creative mastery plays such as arts and crafts, and less aggressive play. The play therapist verifies with the parents and the teachers that the presenting concerns have improved consistently. Then the child graduates from play therapy and only returns as needed. 

00:51:30
SUGARLOAF  How do these play therapy skills differ from other activities than a school or community mental health counselor may do? 

00:51:40
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Great question, Sugarloaf. During crisis intervention a large group guidance, counselors tend to use a more directive approach through play therapy techniques such as art activities where children draw coping strategies, a cognitive behavioral approach of scripted puppet shows that normalize children's response to trauma and self-soothing anxiety management activities like blowing bubbles or the butterfly hug, crossing your arms and patting either side of your arm. 

00:52:15
SUGARLOAF Oh, oh, I know. Another question. Where do you find, people find out about play therapy training and toys? 

00:52:20
JENNIFER BAGGERLY  Great question, Sugarloaf. The best way to find out about play therapy training, toys, books and other resources is to go to the Association for Play Therapy webpage at www.a4pt.org. Thank you for joining us. We hope you're now bouncing with the basics in play therapy. Play well.
