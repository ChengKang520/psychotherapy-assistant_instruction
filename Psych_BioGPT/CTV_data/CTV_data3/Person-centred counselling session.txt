The client in this session is by an actor 

00:00:20
BARRY KOPP So we've, we've a little bit of a talk about what work we're gonna be doing today. And you… We're talking about looking or exploring, way your depression was coming from at least, moment in time. 

00:00:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. Umm… My life just seems pretty crazy at the minute, umm… and some sort of not so good things have happened to me. Uh… I've just failed a year in university. Umm… And so all of my friends have left because they have all graduated, so I'm still at university. Umm… And I felt quite alone and I just felt like my life is out of control at the minute. 

00:01:00
BARRY KOPP And something about being out of control, somehow being alone, like your friends have moved on and you sort of still hear, almost repeating or going to be repeating, like you have what you've already done. 

00:01:15
UNKNOWN Umm… Yeah. Umm… Yeah, and I mean… Yeah, I feel quite sort of angry about it. And I feel, I feel reckless at the minute. 

00:01:35
BARRY KOPP Angry, reckless, something about this anger and recklessness. 

00:01:40
[sil.] 

00:01:45
UNKNOWN I mean, I think things are coming up for me from what has happened in my life. And I think it's having an impact on me now, uh… which has strained because it's like, ten, over ten years off, off to that, off that actually happened. Umm… And basically got parents divorced and I've not seen or spoken to my mom since then. I live with my dad. Well, not anymore because at the university. And, yeah, I'm just finding it very difficult to cope and as you can see I've just failed a year. So and I'm caught down. 

00:02:25
BARRY KOPP So this down, this, this anger, this feeling reckless is not just about failing this university. Something about your parents splitting up ten years ago, if I've got that right. 

00:02:40
UNKNOWN I'm not sure. I mean, that's probably the, something I've never been able to speak about. But, I mean, I don't really have a reason for failing university, just from my, for my own sort of recklessness, which is just sort come about. Umm… 

00:03:00
BARRY KOPP Come about since… 

00:03:00
UNKNOWN The last, I would say the last two years I've been pretty bad and this all concern I had now. 

00:03:10
BARRY KOPP So something changed for you two years ago? 

00:03:15
UNKNOWN I left home two years ago. 

00:03:15
BARRY KOPP To start university? 

00:03:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. I suppose, I'm having to fend for myself now. Umm… having to grow up, umm… living in London on my own. Umm… feeling quite lonely since I've been in London. Uh… 

00:03:45
BARRY KOPP Feeling like, somehow I got, now take responsibility for my life, but also feeling that I'm alone. I'm alone in this big city in London. 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. And I don't feel like, I've got the skills the dare. I know I have, but I just almost feel like I don't have the skills to do it. 

00:04:10
BARRY KOPP Skill to do it. 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN To look after myself. 

00:04:10
BARRY KOPP To look after yourself. 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN Umm… 

00:04:15
BARRY KOPP But I didn't know how to look after myself. 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN No, because I'm not being obviously very kind to myself. I mean, I'm going out and spending lots of money, spending on my loan, drinking lots, partying, all the normal things, but to fail a year, it's not, that's not cool like… 

00:04:35
BARRY KOPP So on the one hand doing all the normal student things, going out being, maybe reckless drinking, clubbing, sort of living that sort of lifestyle, but somehow not engaging with my studies, not taking the responsibilities side for caring for myself, caring for, perhaps the reason why I'm (inaudible ). 

00:05:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, that sort of… Yeah, I'm, that's why I'm lacking I feel and I'm angry at myself as well, umm… for not being better and doing better. Umm… So… 

00:05:15
BARRY KOPP There's two sorts of betters that being better in doing better. 

00:05:20
[sil.] 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN Being better in terms of my behavior I suppose and doing better in terms of my studies I think. 

00:05:35
BARRY KOPP I think and you know, I'm not quite sure about this, this, this better or I'm doing better. Can I be better or do you better or… 

00:05:45
UNKNOWN Umm… Yeah. 

00:05:50
[sil.] 

00:05:55
UNKNOWN I'm not quite sure. I don't know. Umm… It's confusing. Umm… 

00:06:00
BARRY KOPP That feels confusing. What about… What even, what I'm feeling inside. 

00:06:10
UNKNOWN Umm… Yeah. 

00:06:10
BARRY KOPP Well, we can maybe stay with that sense of confusion, maybe what that's about. 

00:06:20
UNKNOWN Umm… Yeah, it feels quite painful. It feels… It makes me feel a bit wobbly. So… 

00:06:25
BARRY KOPP Wobbly painful, painful… Where this pain… 

00:06:30
UNKNOWN Sadness. 

00:06:30
BARRY KOPP Sadness. 

00:06:30
UNKNOWN Umm… 

00:06:35
BARRY KOPP Feeling sad. 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN Umm… 

00:06:40
[sil.] 

00:06:45
BARRY KOPP Pain and sadness. 

00:06:50
UNKNOWN Umm… Yeah. Umm… Feeling alone. Umm… I suppose… 

00:07:05
[sil.] 

00:07:15
BARRY KOPP Take your time. 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN No. Yeah, not having someone to look after me. Not… I suppose… Yeah, I don't feel like I've got that person to care for me. I haven't… Probably not having my mom in the pictures, probably quite an impact on my life, but… 

00:07:35
[sil.] 

00:07:40
BARRY KOPP You know, have there anyone to care for me and one thing (inaudible )almost, to saying, have I actually had anyone to take care of me, since my mom left? 

00:07:50
UNKNOWN Not really. I mean, my dad's in the picture, but, you know, he's busy, he's got the children and he's trying to put the food on the table. He just hasn't been able to tend or, or care and he's a man as well. Umm… So I think I obviously struggle with that and… Yeah, I think maybe looking after myself, although I feel I don't deserve to look after myself. 

00:08:20
BARRY KOPP I don't deserve to look after myself because I've not been looked after. 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN Uh-umm… Oh, I don't feel good enough to look after myself, myself. 

00:08:30
BARRY KOPP That I'm not good enough. Not good enough to be cared or to cared for myself. 

00:08:40
[sil.] 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, almost like I'm not, I'm not worth that. Umm… 

00:09:00
BARRY KOPP Strong words, isn't it? Not worth it. It was worth, worthless. 

00:09:10
UNKNOWN Uh-umm… At times, yeah. I can get into that place very much so. 

00:09:15
BARRY KOPP Uh-umm.. And that's when I start sinking into this feeling depressed, when I start feeling worthless. 

00:09:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, exactly. 

00:09:25
BARRY KOPP And that's when I become reckless? 

00:09:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, that comes hand in hand. Umm… It's almost like, you know, a quick fix. It doesn't make me feel better. 

00:09:40
BARRY KOPP Uh… 

00:09:40
UNKNOWN Umm… Obviously temporarily. 

00:09:40
BARRY KOPP So where you can go and sort of that drunk and do, all that sort of reckless stuff and somehow feel better for myself, but temporally. 

00:09:50
UNKNOWN Umm… Exactly. And this is being going on for quite a while. And I suppose, when I failed university, umm… I, my year at university, I'm skinned as well, because I've to, you know, pay for myself. That was my wake-up call really. Umm… And this is a sort of free counselling service through the university, so I thought… Yeah, I need to sort out. 

00:10:20
BARRY KOPP I need to sort out in order to move forward, in order to engage with why I'm here, if I want to be here. 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN I want to be here. I want… I do want to be here. Umm… It's something I think I need to, I need to… Though I've need to have faced for a number of years. So I'm not exactly sure what I need to face though, but I know there's something that is making me react like this. 

00:10:55
BARRY KOPP Something that goes back to when your parents split up, divorced and your mother left your life. 

00:11:00
UNKNOWN Umm… 

00:11:05
BARRY KOPP Well, you haven't had that contact with her… 

00:11:05
UNKNOWN Uh-umm… 

00:11:10
[sil.] 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN No. Uh… Yeah, it's really sad and I think if… When I think about it, it's, yeah, it's almost too much to think about. 

00:11:35
BARRY KOPP Why is it too much to think, and don't try the word retraction. 

00:11:40
UNKNOWN Uh… Yeah. And, yeah, basically that, that was it. 

00:11:50
[sil.] 

00:11:55
BARRY KOPP Will that, will they actually (inaudible ). 

00:12:00
[sil.] 

00:12:05
UNKNOWN That was it, as in (inaudible ). That's what happened, that's how I failed. That's… Because I, I don't know. Was I not good enough for her? Umm… When I start to feel these feelings, it makes me feel not good enough. Sometimes… Well, most of the time… 

00:12:30
[sil.] 

00:12:35
UNKNOWN I think I'm quite sensitive in my everyday life and I think, you know, with friends, boyfriends, if I feel slightly rejected, I do get into a very sort of dark place. Umm… Too much so un-rational in a sense, quite unstable. 

00:13:00
BARRY KOPP And actually that, anyone that I get close to, I feel even the slightest retractions really impacts on me and that way I felt. 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, I mean, initial it's fine and I can build, I can build relationships really easily, but then it gets to a point where, umm… I'm just so scared because and I think everyone feels that, but I'm really, you know, really scared of that person going and I feel, is, has wrecked relationships in my life because it's like, I can't get pass that point. I can but all, I just act out and I may think I'm a difficult person to be with when I feel that insecurity and it always comes in at a certain time and… 

00:13:50
BARRY KOPP A certain time… 

00:13:50
UNKNOWN I'm talking about sort of partners in my life. Umm… After, I suppose, after I actually feel something for them, then I can't almost get past the thought of them leaving me, it's too painful for me to really fall in love with someone. 

00:14:10
BARRY KOPP So I can go so far and then to take that next step to really trust, to fall in love to, in the sense give of myself to someone is too much because, the fear of redirection is so overpowering. 

00:14:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. And, yeah, and so I'm, I'm alone in London and, but then I don't want to be alone either. So it's just… I get myself into that situation and then I feel even unhappier. 

00:14:45
BARRY KOPP And when you're saying alone, you're talking about personal relationships or just friendships or friendships and getting close to anyone. 

00:14:55
UNKNOWN Umm… Sorry, what's the differentiation? What do you mean, between friends and, and boyfriends or… Umm… Friends not so much, but still I think that, there is insecurity there. Umm… But no, not, not as much. 

00:15:15
BARRY KOPP So I can form relationships with friends and that feels okay, although that might be sort of, you know, they are not 100% sure. But it's more than close relationship? 

00:15:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:15:30
BARRY KOPP Sorry… 

00:15:30
UNKNOWN No, no, no, that's, that's why I think umm… I can develop very good fiends, but I can feel quite insecure at times, but I think that's more to do with when I feel genuinely insecure in my life and not really to do with that relationship, well, that makes any sense.. 

00:15:50
BARRY KOPP So relationships is just area where I feel insecure, there's other (inaudible ) of my life where I can start to feel insecure as well. 

00:15:55
UNKNOWN Then just relationship Yeah. Umm… but not all the time. 

00:16:05
BARRY KOPP So it's more specific time that I start to feel insecure? 

00:16:10
UNKNOWN I think you can get triggered and then, it kind of all goes bad. 

00:16:20
BARRY KOPP Umm… These triggers when it goes bad… 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN Umm… Umm… Stuff like we've already talked about. Stuff like rejection. Umm… It's hard to say. Umm… It's hard to say. I can't really put my finger on that. Umm… 

00:16:55
[sil.] 

00:17:05
BARRY KOPP There's something that triggers that we may not quite sure what that trigger. 

00:17:10
UNKNOWN Umm… I think it can be a number of things. Umm… 

00:17:15
[sil.] 

00:17:25
UNKNOWN I suppose, you know, for example an argument with and if I argue with my boyfriend or something like that. Umm… And I feel, you know, or the end of a relationship. Umm… I don't know, it's quite hard to say, sorry. 

00:17:50
BARRY KOPP But I guess there's something there about ending. 

00:17:50
UNKNOWN Umm… 

00:17:50
BARRY KOPP Ending of relationships or an argument… 

00:17:55
UNKNOWN That could be, things final. 

00:18:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-umm… Well, I maybe get in the sense of being retracted or pushed aside, that somehow my fault. 

00:18:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah, very much so. 

00:18:10
BARRY KOPP Uh-umm… Maybe in a similar way to what perhaps you hinted out, that wasn't my fault that… Umm… I, I don't see my mother as well, it was something I did wrong. 

00:18:25
UNKNOWN Umm… Umm… Yeah, I mean, I was young girl when she left and… That's what you think when you're a child. It's like, you know… Yeah, and I suppose I've carried that through, through with me to my, my adult life. But also they not knowing really why. I know that she had problems, umm… but, you know, my dad has got a new wife now and don't really talk about it. But, umm… umm… 

00:19:05
[sil.] 

00:19:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:19:10
BARRY KOPP Then I suppose what you're saying is, I really don't know why my mother left? 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN Umm… No, not really. 

00:19:20
BARRY KOPP And no one has talked about it with me, eh… 

00:19:25
UNKNOWN No. I know that she umm… had problems with alcohol, but my dad isn't very nice with her. So, umm… So that's, that's my reasoning that she had, that she's with alcohol and she can handle her own life. 

00:19:45
BARRY KOPP Umm… That she couldn't handle her own life and, and she drink to cope with whatever was going on for her. And perhaps the similar way when you're not coping. 

00:19:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, I wish, think, makes me full shit about myself because, you know, I don't want to turn out like my mom. 

00:20:05
BARRY KOPP I don't want to turn out like how I, perhaps seen my mom to be, even though I didn't really know. 

00:20:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, I suppose. 

00:20:15
BARRY KOPP But from what I've heard is, sort of similarity of turning to, turning to drink. 

00:20:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. Which then feeds into my, my guilt feelings and my self-worth and all of that sort of stuff and low self esteem. And then… Yeah, just makes me feel even more depressed. 

00:20:45
BARRY KOPP Umm… Sort of guilt, low self esteem, all compounds this depression. 

00:20:55
UNKNOWN Umm… 

00:20:55
BARRY KOPP Feeling worthless in someway. 

00:20:55
UNKNOWN Umm… 

00:21:00
[sil.] 

00:21:10
UNKNOWN Umm… Really I just, you know, I just want someone to pick me up and tell me that it's all gonna be all right and to someone to look after me and say, you know, you're not that bad or… You are, you are, you are a good girl, you know. It's all gonna be okay. 

00:21:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-umm… That someone will somehow to say, you're a good girl, you, you're sort of a valuable and it's all gonna be okay and you can do this and he's gonna stand by you, then, somehow I would feel… 

00:21:50
UNKNOWN Easier. 

00:21:55
BARRY KOPP Easier? 

00:22:00
UNKNOWN Umm… Yeah, easier to be… Yeah, if, if I was held it would be… Yeah, in my life it would be easier to get through, I suppose. Umm… 

00:22:10
BARRY KOPP Easier to get through. 

00:22:15
UNKNOWN Umm… Periods of time like that. 

00:22:20
[sil.] 

00:22:25
BARRY KOPP That I sort of feel that I got new one on my side, new one I can really turn to. 

00:22:30
UNKNOWN No. Umm… I mean, it's quite embarrassing really. Umm… It's not something I really want to share with people. Umm… And I don't feel comfortable to talk to my friends about it because I sure not think they would really understand because they have all had quite good lives. So I don't really want to put that on them. Umm… I say, no, I feel quite alone you all. 

00:23:00
BARRY KOPP So not only you're alone, but almost that I, I hide this from other people. I don't want other people to know because how could they possibly understand what I'm going through. 

00:23:15
UNKNOWN Possibly understand? Yeah or… Yeah. They might just, you know, I don't know because they have not been through. They might just think it's really bizarre, just, so, I don't know. 

00:23:35
BARRY KOPP So if I actually sort of show them this pain in this heart, this, this confusion, this depression then, because they may not understand or won't understand, they too may retract me. 

00:23:50
UNKNOWN I suppose in a sense, yes. Yeah, I wouldn't want them to stop liking me. 

00:23:55
BARRY KOPP Uh… Uh-umm… 

00:24:00
[sil.] 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN Umm… Yeah, and so I… Yeah, I just keep it to myself and then go out drinking and be reckless and then, umm… Yeah, and then it's just feeding into my depressing. 

00:24:20
[sil.] 

00:24:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-umm… It's all right and go out and be reckless and almost paint on this happy face. 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN Umm… 

00:24:30
BARRY KOPP Everything is okay. I'm just having a good time and not really inside, I'm hurting alone. 

00:24:40
UNKNOWN Umm… Yeah, very much so. 

00:24:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-umm… Then the word frightened as well. 

00:24:50
[sil.] 

00:24:55
UNKNOWN More hurt I think. 

00:24:55
BARRY KOPP More hurt? 

00:24:55
UNKNOWN Umm… 

00:25:00
BARRY KOPP Can we just stay without the hurt? Just explore what hurt is? 

00:25:05
UNKNOWN Umm… 

00:25:10
[sil.] 

00:25:15
UNKNOWN Just… Hurt that, your own mom would leave you and you would never get an explanation about it. Umm… Upset. 

00:25:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-umm… What did I do? 

00:25:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. Angry, pissed off. 

00:25:35
BARRY KOPP Pissed off… 

00:25:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, pissed off. 

00:25:40
BARRY KOPP Yeah. And no way you're finding the answer? 

00:25:45
UNKNOWN I suppose there would be, but that involves talking about it umm… and speaking to my dad about it. He's got a new wife and step children and it's not something that he wants to talk about. Umm… So it's always been something I should just contain and I do. Umm… but that really pisses me off as well. Umm… So, yeah, in a sense, no, no way of talking about it or I don't really know how to talk about it. I find it difficult here. It's not something I've, I ever talked about. So… 

00:26:20
BARRY KOPP And yet you're doing well. 

00:26:25
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:26:25
BARRY KOPP Talking about it. 

00:26:30
UNKNOWN Umm… I've thought about it a lot. 

00:26:30
BARRY KOPP Umm… And I guess you're also saying, look, your father has also moved on like, he's moved on to a new family. Okay, you know, he's pushing that old life away. 

00:26:40
UNKNOWN Umm… Umm… Yeah, I've never thought about it like that. Umm… 

00:26:45
BARRY KOPP How does it feel talking about it? 

00:26:50
UNKNOWN Umm… About my dad or about everything? 

00:26:55
BARRY KOPP Just talking about here today? 

00:27:00
UNKNOWN Umm… A little bit uncomfortable. 

00:27:05
BARRY KOPP Uh-umm… 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN Umm… At times quite upsetting, but I don't really want to share you that. Umm… I think I've contained that pretty well. Umm… I know there's a lot of sadness there. I might not be sharing you that, but I, I know there is. Umm… But, yeah, really, I don't know. I anger as well. I anger at my dad I think, both of them, but more my dad. 

00:27:40
BARRY KOPP Umm… But I somehow started to talk about it today. You started to verbalize that anger and recklessness and maybe that disappointment. And, yeah, I'm still trying to contain it as well, that, even here or not. Quite sure if I can fully go there yet. 

00:28:05
UNKNOWN Umm… I… Yeah, I mean, I just think once I do, I don't know, something stopping me from going there. I know I've, I've got… I know I'm an adult and I know that, that is (inaudible )I've got to deal with because it's really my life. Umm… But… Not… Yeah, it's kind of like a, a lid on it (inaudible ). It's, I'm quite tight. 

00:28:35
BARRY KOPP Maybe started to loosen just a little. 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Just, I mean, this is… This space is already helped me think about so many different things, but umm… Yeah, my mind just feels like it's going like that. 

00:28:55
BARRY KOPP Well, this is only our first session and I'm (inaudible ) of the time. And I'm wondering, maybe how useful you found today. 

00:29:10
UNKNOWN Umm… I think for the first time it's helped me so (inaudible )… 

00:29:15
[sil.] 

00:29:20
UNKNOWN Not put a label on things but so I'll understand the whole sort of thing that you talked about with my mom and the rejection there and that, bringing that into my life and sort of, how that is in my life in other ways, that's sort of… For the first time actually really clarified that. You've, you've been able to clarify that to me. Umm… I don't think I've ever sort of really been able to say in a space I'm pissed off at my mom and dad, that's… 

00:29:50
BARRY KOPP A powerful statement. 

00:29:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. Umm… 

00:29:55
[sil.] 

00:30:05
UNKNOWN Umm… Yeah, just been, been able to sort of, actually categorize what's going on, instead of it going like that. 

00:30:20
BARRY KOPP So sort of putting that out there has started to help start to maybe make some sense and some understanding of what's going on for you. Hold to the start by (inaudible ) journey. 

00:30:31
UNKNOWN Yeah, the areas that I want to look at I suppose. 

00:30:35
BARRY KOPP How would you feel about continuing? 

00:30:35
UNKNOWN Umm… Yeah, this is… I, I really want to move forward and I'm such a stay in my normal everyday life that I feel there's no other way. So yeah… 

00:30:50
BARRY KOPP Well, thank you for sharing with me today. 

00:30:50
UNKNOWN It's okay. 

00:30:55
BARRY KOPP I look forward to meeting you again for our next session.
