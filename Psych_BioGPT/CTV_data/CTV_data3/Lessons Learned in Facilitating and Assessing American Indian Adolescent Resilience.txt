Lessons Learned in Facilitating and Assessing American Indian Adolescent Resilience Teresa D. LaFromboise, Ph.D. 

00:00:00
CHUCK  It's really a thrill and an, an honor for me to introduce ah, Teresa LaFromboise ah, and welcome her to Tempe and to introduce her as a keynote speaker. Ah, the reason for that is uhm, we were both fledgling Assistant Professors at the University of Nebraska and Lincoln and ah, have known each (laughs) other even longer than Patricia and Janet have known each other. So, I don't know. I can't even believe that. But uhm, we have a long history and ah, I've, ah, I've watched ah, Teresa's growth and impact with a great deal of interest and pride throughout the years and ah, it's uhm, ah, again, as I say, just quite a thrill to have her here at this point in her career. Ah, Teresa got her uhm, Ph.D. Degree from the University of Oklahoma and ah, ah, ah, after teaching at the University of Nebraska and Lincoln, went to Stanford University ah, initially on a temporary appointment and then that became a permanent appointment, and she teaches at Stanford today as an Associate Professor of Counseling Psychology. Ah, she spent her time, ah, three or four years in the midst of her, her Stanford years at the University of Wisconsin and Madison as well. Uhm, Teresa is a, a descendant, a direct descendant of the Miami Tribe of Indiana and ah, most of her work, which I'll detail in a moment, has had to do with ah, multicultural counseling and mental health services in general, but also ah, American-Indian psychology in particular. Teresa ah, was uhm, ah, her husband, a president of the Society of Indian Psychologists and she was the Founding Chair of American Indian Studies at Stanford University. She is an American Psychological Association Council Representative for Division 45, which of course, is the society for the psychological study of ethnic minority issues. She received an Outstanding Contribution Award ah, from the Mental Health Social Service Program of the Indian Health Service in 1996, and a Women of Color Psychologist Award from the Association of Women in Psychology in 1992. Teresa's publications uhm, ah, are very, very many. (laughs) Ah, I think the highlights ah, ah, as listed on the program, I wanna also mention here because they're very impactful. Uhm, she wrote the American ah, Indian Mental Health Policy in counseling American Indian minorities which is published in 1998. Ah, with a variety of co-authors, she wrote Multicultural Counseling Competencies also in 1998, ah, American Indian Life Skills Development Curriculum in 1996. An important psychological bulletin article that she co-authored with Coleman and Gerton, The Psychological Impact of Biculturalism: Evidence and Theory. A counseling psychologist article, Counseling Intervention and American Indian Tradition: An Integrative Approach. And finally, and these are again only the highlights of her many many contributions, ah, a chapter in an edited book called Bringing Cultural Diversity to Feminists Psychology. And her, the name of her chapter was ah, American-Indian Women and Psychology. Ah, it's hard to, to think of a person who's had uhm, a more important impact on psychology in such different ways in social policy and traditional research, and integrating the research findings and making them relevant to people everywhere, and to organizing psychologists and mental health professionals to deliver services more, uhm, ah, more effectively and with more of a sense of mission and inspiration. So with all of that, I would like to welcome ah, Professor ah, Teresa LaFromboise to ah, to Tempe and ah, to the podium.

DR. TERESA D. LAFROMBOISE  Thank you, Chuck, that was very nice. (laughs) Uhm, and I guess, you know, how we're always hard on ourselves. I was thinking about it. I'm just ah, still kind of blown away by the introduction because when I first met Chuck, I was afraid of uhm, not being able to publish the first empirical article I believe, so (laughs) that was nice. And of course then, I'm also very aware of the dates of these things, and I'm realizing that uhm, there's not a lot happening in the last few years. (laughs) I feel like I've been an administrator instead of a, you know, faculty member, but, you know, hopefully ah, that will change. But, and I'd like to share some of that work with you. Okay, uhm, when I was asked to give this talk, I, maybe it's coming from the sort of uhm, middle-age, ah, over-the-hill, or whatever kind of feeling that I (laughs) have. I had to ask, you know, why I might have been asked to, to do this special thing. And uhm, I wanted to share ah, you know, in, I thought, well, what, what could I really do that wouldn't be, would be different than reading articles that I've written or hearing from someone better. And I'll have to say that there are many really good people in Indian country delivering services, and some very good people there coming up. Uhm, and I think one of the things is that the need is so great that many of the times, people don't have time to actually put their good work into pe, into print and they don't get the proper recognition that they really should have. So I thought, well, I'll talk a little bit about some lessons that I've learned along the way in terms of uhm, working towards uhm, the development of some interventions to foster Indian adolescent resilience. Uhm, and I also thought that, you know, it really, the, the fact that I've been invited and included in this, uhm, in this conference, says something also about the interest in members of Division 17 of, of the American Psychological Association, uhm, interest in really understanding cultural phenomenon that's changed so much. And the, ah, you know, the, the you know, the massive amount of work and racial identity development and multicultural competence, uhm, the popularity of the multicultural summits, ah, the annual roundtable at, uhm, on cross-cultural counseling at ah, Teachers College, and now, you know, your attendance here at conferences like this RACE to 2002 really shows that we've come a long way, and that's very exciting. Uhm, as Chuck mentioned, I've been in the field for 20 some years and I've worked a lot at uhm, trying to help, culturally tailor cognitive interventions for Indian youth. Uhm, I'm, I'm of mixed Indian background obviously. I'm of ah, Miami and Irish descent on my mother side, and German and English on my father side. Some people would say I, when Maria Ruth started coining the term being multiracial, uhm, ah, I felt, you know, first, I resisted that, you know. And the, then as I read the literature more and more, I realized that that really did described certainly my experience. So uhm, you might say that I'm a little mixed up (chuckles) but I'm, I'm, I'm pleased and thankful, you know, for that background. Okay. And also some people, I, I feel a little bit awkward sometimes being asked to represent Indian issues because of being of this mixed background, and uhm, I realized that, you know, people have told me, "You know, don't, you don't need to apologize. You don't need to feel that you are part Indian. You're either Indian, I know you're not in what you do." So I think those were some of the reasons that I've been asked to be here and I really feel honored Chuck and Patricia for being asked to do this. In this talk, I'm gonna start out in an, rather awkward fashion and that, sort of, like the true experimental fashion of stating the problem, okay? And then, I wanna get to that because of, trying to show, you know, present a framework or maybe we'll ah, get away from that kind of method. And I'll have to say I feel rather raw about it because I've just recently submitted an article on, for publication and of course, it was rejected. And, and some of it is trying not to do that of submitting the statement of the problem at the beginning but rather to go from a resilience perspective. And I guess I assume that people should understand that the hardship is there, so let me just begin on some of the, sort of, sovereign re, ah, you know, facts about or reports about the quality of Indian adolescent life. It's a backdrop to the issue of resilience. Uhm, given the current recession that we're in, I think that life was difficult in reservations in the past certainly. But again, it seems like there's another little level of hard, another level of hardship on reservations (clears throat) as more and more have ah, you know, are, are looking for jobs. And it really requires, for especially for Indian youth, a, a great deal of resourcefulness and competence and flexibility usually to go back and forth in order to make some kind of a living or to be able to help out with the family. And certainly in my work on biculturalism, really may ah, brought home to me very clearly the idea biculturalism was simplistic, specially for adolescents. That it wasn't uhm, just adjusting to, you know, tribal cultures, ah, sometimes more than one for stu, for a particular individual ah, and the, and the mainstream culture, but also what was being able to really be a part of the youth culture. And that I was, you know, ah, making it sound too simple. So in terms of, ah, from a cultural perspective certainly, Indian adolescents are always dealing with the shifting requirements of different social and cultural systems that they grow up in. Now, we know that some people are raised under extremely adverse situations and do very well and live healthy and productive lives. And then, there are others that have minimal challenges that seem like they can't really overcome any of their, of their, of, some of the adversities they experience later on in life. Okay. And I, when I talk about some of the problems that I'm gonna outline now for two ah, pages worth, okay? I don't wanna imply that I'm trying to, I'm equating risk with group membership, but I just wanna uhm, mention a few. Uhm, about a decade ago, I was fortunate enough to serve on the office of technology ah, assessments report on Indian adolescent mental health. And basically in that report, it was indicated that, that Indian adolescents had more serious mental health problems than all other ethnic groups in the US population with respect to developmental disabilities, depression, suicide, anxiety, alcohol and substance use, self-esteem and al, alienation, running away, and school dropout. Other risk factors that you see in the literature are things that concerning repeated traumatic loss, poverty, economic disadvantage, social disorganization, political disempowerment, parental boarding ho, school experiences, ah, differences in learning styles, chronic health conditions, he goes on. (laughs) I, I hate to do this. Transience or, or the absence of community ties for some, and uhm, the corresponding decline in resources opportunities and support. Blum and his colleagues in analyzing the ah, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health Data found that 6 percent of the sample of Indian youth showed signs of severe emotional distress. About 18 percent showed uhm, indicated some e, experience with abuse, and most of them, those that had experienced neglect, or abused also experienced ah, quite a bit of alcoholism and me, other major problems. We know that a fundamental problem for Indian youth is the incidence of substance abuse. (clears throat) We also know the, and, and this has been confirmed in the studies that I've worked directly with, that uhm, approximately 23 to 25 percent of Indian adolescents in boarding schools and other settings that I've been in ha, have attempted suicide. Uhm, along with that, they experienced a lot of traumatic loss (clears throat) of family and friends ah, at a much higher rate than the general population because of accidental and premature death or maybe long separations from family for medical treatment, education, and employment opportunities. And then if we start to look at gender, we realized that Indian girls are particularly uhm, taxed in terms of ah, being victims of violent behavior, in terms of battery, rape, sexual assault or incest. They have high teen pregnancy rates, undergo suicide-related hospitalizations more frequently than Indian boys, and it goes on. Now, there's that, there's that side of the coin. But then, the, on the other hand, all of you know that there are a number of people that are doing quite well. And that, that uhm, a few years ago ah, when Kevin ah, Gover was the uhm, head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, he had, ah, ah, rather, you know, neat statement where he talked about this is the time of, you know, a new attitude. The, and that, that by some measures, the 20th Century ah, was the Indian success story in terms of the advances that had been made. So I've always been interested in resilience by just the experiences that I've had with Indian elders. But I also think that resilience is a theme. And it certainly is a theme because of the advancement of, well, Seligman and the work within APA in terms of pos, positive psychology and it's growing all over. But it's also really, sort of, a theme ah, specially for many of the communities that are doing much better because of the resources that they've been able to accrue du, given ah, Indian gaming. So with this success story, (clears throat) basically we can se, we see ah, that uhm, ah, in just ah, since 1968, there have been 31 fully-accredited tribal colleges in 12 states. Tribal languages are being revitalized through the internet and various community and school programs, so that 175 tribal languages are still spoken today, 50 of them are spoken by two or more generations. One third of the 557 tribes in the US now operate the casinos and offer a, of, offer employment opportunities and lending resources. I'm often drawn into conversations about whether ga, gaming is good in Indian communities and I guess I think in area of uhm, mental health that a lot of problems that people have are economically driven. Uhm, and it's really exciting to me to work with the community as I did a few years ago who was able to offer health insurance for each and every tribal member, regardless of whether they lived on the reservation, New York City or Cleveland, Ohio. And that's the difference, a big difference. Okay? So (clears throat) where I am now is having had some nice experiences with, and I'll show, share some data with you on a project where I was able to actually begin to start trying to, you know, look at ways to model resiliency. (clears throat) But I also realized that I was really operating from a very uhm, sort of uhm, culturally insensitive perspective in doing that. And I'd like to, to think of a way, ah, a sort of, a process that I've been going through as I'm working on a gra, grant proposal to improve upon that work. And I thought, thought that perhaps in doing this, maybe there are couple of things that could be achieved. One, this is the end of the conference and you're ready to go home, and you've got hopefully a lot of nice ideas that you've experienced in, in, I, in things that you plan to do as a result of the things that you've learned in this conference. And this framework that I'm about to share might be something that you'll carry with you uhm, regardless of the details of the experience of my research, and I hope that happens. Okay. Resilience is often defined as adaptability despite adverse circumstances or obstacles, or the ability to become even more capable in difficult times by learning new skills, developing creative ways of coping and overcoming life's challenges. In some of the work that I've done though recently, I've been, sort of, uhm, questioned about that sort of technical ah, definition by more traditional people that have talked about it really as an ongoing life process of, of creating balance and striving for harmony. So I thought I would try this pra, this practice that was really given to me a few years ago by a person that actually is a law student here at ASU, his name is Joey Thomas Fliesaway(ph) (inaudible ), okay? He was a student of mine at Stanford. And he developed a course on Indian spirituality that, and taught it, and I happened to be the fat, the, just the faculty sponsor. And uhm, I, the first class session, there were 100 and some students there. And uhm, uhm, someone from the administration called and said, "Well, maybe, you'd, he's never taught a course before. I mean, do you think you should look in and see how it's going?" And, and so I did, you know, for a few weeks. And certainly, I learned a lot from him. Ah, if any of you are interested and you wanna uhm, uhm, of, I guess there's information how to contact me. I have a really nice, about five-page description of this process from Joey that I'll be glad to, to send to you. Okay. Ah, he since was the tribal chairman of his tribe. He now serves on the tribal council and, and he's a law student here. Okay. Uhm, it's basically a process of ceremony. It's a process of preparing for a ceremony, okay? And through this, he is saying that Indian people discover order in a clearer perspective on life through ceremonial acts as we know, rather than looking at linear thinking. Alright. And I'm thinking that if you allow me to do this, perhaps you are allowing me an opportunity to sustain ah, a method that I'm trying to use to seek order and harmony in the universe and my own life as well, and share with you. Ceremonies are very important in, in many cultures, and certainly in, in, in Indian life. It's uhm, served as a way for generations of people to find direction in life in par, in spite of nearly hopeless situations at times and genocidal atrocities perpetuated by the government in early settlers. It's a way of, to counteract the multifaceted pressures of living in an increasely, increasingly unsettled society. There are a lot of different types of ceremonies. Each is distinct in its own right. Many communities have their own. Some people, you know, modify them as they go. But taking collectively, they really form a way of maintaining a kind of spirituality and self-control for individuals that, that engage in ceremonial life. Three, that you're probably very ah, familiar with, I would think more commonly known, uhm, are, uhm, I'll mention now, one is the giveaway ceremony. Okay. Ah, which I think is a very important valued ceremony, and, and serve the purpose at one time of maintaining material balance in the community. But basically, it's, you know, the process of giving thanksgiving and show, showing thanksgiving and giving to others uhm, whenever, you know, in, in honor, or when asked about something rather than accepting gifts. The sweat lodge ceremony are, is a very, you know, as you know, popular purification right in which participants make offerings to the great spirit for health and balance in life. The vision quest is one that involves looking for one's place within the community. Ah, how, where, how am I going to contribute to the well-being of the community? And these are just a few. I mean, if you probably heard of the, ah, you know, ceremonies to celebrate the first smile or the first laugh or the be, first step or you know, the obvious one like coming, coming of age. I fortunately just ah, been able to participate in an important ceremony, my daughter just graduated from college at the University of North Dakota in December and, and there, uhm, important for all of us to celebrate different milestones like that. Okay. Well, in the process of the, of, of ceremonies, there's a lot of formal procedures that go on in getting mentally and spiritually prepared for them. Uhm, and according to ah, this ah, framework that Joey Thomas ah, shared with us, uhm, he talked about four phases of preparation: cleaning, organizing, remembering and reuniting as phase three, and prayer and meditation. And once a person has completed each of these four phases, many of the kinds of negative thoughts and anxiety that one has ah, can go away. And therefore, we can be more to attuned and focused on matters that are important in life. So, I offer these four phases: cleaning, organizing, remembering and reuniting as phase three, and prayer and meditation as cornerstones to try to build my impressions on ways to be more effective in research and intervention development with Indian youth. The first phase is cleaning, in which, you know, you all know that, we're trying to get rid and purge ourselves of negative influences and clearing the way for healthy restoration of one's body and mind. In the sweat, people get rid of physical and spiritual impurities by praying and meditating, and quite frankly, sweating within enclosures of intense heat. Many of you've participated in them probably. For those of we, you have, who haven't, you may think of something vaguely familiar as uhm, a very similar purging experience uhm, ah, when you say sit in sauna after a heavy workout or ah, a day on the ski slopes, or even more vicariously just driving without air-conditioning through places like Arizona in July and surviving. 

00:23:05
 Yeah. (laughing) 

00:23:05
DR. TERESA D. LAFROMBOISE  Okay. But there's something about suffering that has an undeniable purifying effect. And the importance of this process is to cleanse the way, to establish a more positive outlook, and to have a rebirth of energy and some kind of spiritual renewal. Alright. Now clearly, the research on American-Indian adolescents, ah, adolescent resilience, needs a cleaning. I mean, that was certainly my experience whenever I looked, you know, and I was, I was working in this area and I'm gonna be humbly present some material that isn't that good. I mean it's, it's, to me, a first step in trying to be able to measure Indian adolescent resilience but it was, you know, I think an honest attempt. Now, as I mentioned before, there's this, to begin with, there's this pathological, you know, within our field, we have a pathological emphasis. We're focusing on problems. Alright. I've just given you two pages of a litany of problems I'm almost embarrassed to do so. And it's very easy to realize. I mean, I think anyone that sees specially Indian elders or people living beyond 40 in, you know, in harsh, ah, you know, circumstances, okay? That you, there are all kinds of models of resilience, Indian resilience, right there for us to try to emulate. Unfortunately, if I started to try to look for that in the literature, I could only fou, I found no empirical studies that focused on Indian resilience. Right. And this is the first and this, this study that we, that I'm presenting to you uhm, is going to be published in a book uhm, along with ah, one of my students, Lisa Oliver, in the book, ah, I mean, the book is not our book. The chapter is our book. I mean, our, our studies in a chapter in a book. And the book is edited by Les Whit, Whitbeck and it's called This is Not Our Way: Traditional Culture and Substance Use Prevention in American Indian Adolescents and their Families. In a little while, I'll share that, that data. But in looking, I found two studies that real, ah, kind of, referred to Indian youth resilience, okay? The first one was a study in '97 by Pharris, Resnick, and Blum on Hopelessness and Suicidality in Sexually-Abused American-Indian Adolescents. And it emphasized, then in it, they talked a little bit about resilience and emphasized the importance of protective factors against hopelessness. There was another article by Miller-Heyle, MacPhee, and Fritz in '98 that emphasized the different aspects of a person's life that can contribute to the development of resilience. And really emphasized and focused on parenting such as improving parent, parent self-efficacy and effective child rearing in social support and problem solving skills, as well as developing, uhm, ah, focusing on children's developmental attainments ah, that would contribute to uhm, the susceptibility for subs, you know, it's for, with, you know, uhm, ah, abstaining or limiting substance use. My own work ah, on American Indian life skills, for those of you that have seen the, the manual that was uhm, here, uhm, wa, we focused, we did the, you know, the wrong thing and that, you know, we, we come from a target foc, problem perspective, right? And we were focusing on Indian youth suicide. Now actually, the, part of I think what happens with that is that a community will more or less invite you to help with a certain problem, okay? And so you get invited in with that. And the idea of trying to capture, im, you know, resilience just seems like that's, ah, you know, that's unnecessary, right? So with the work on uhm, Indian youth suicide, I have to say though I really had uhm, an, an incredible bias. I mean, when we were asked by the Zuni Pueblo to work on this, the title of the manual at the beginning was Zuni Suicide Prevention. I mean, and people just said, "You can't use that word here, you know?" And we, this isn't really about suicide. I mean, it is about suicide prevention but it's really about promoting life. And you know, the, the interventionist in me said, well, let's, let's focus on the target problem. There are a lot of related problems such as communication, problem solving, depression, anger, et cetera. Let's for, focus on that first and then if we have any extra time, I mean I feel foolish telling you but I might as well put it all out here. Okay. And then if we have any extra time, then we'll get to, you know, life skills because we're gonna go, work first on that and then we, then we'll do the other later. And they're saying absolutely not. I mean, our students won't even, op, ah, you know, engage in this material if you hit it head-on that strongly. And now, you know, and so basically, we went through quite a period of reordering everything and them convincing us that yes, they would stay with the intervention long enough to get to of a seven se, ah, as, a section or seven phases or, or units. We, we, we really will get to five and six, which is where the suicide intervention was. And then we ended with goal, goal setting so that we can get on, end on a positive note. We also didn't have self-esteem enhancement or community development work at the beginning. I mean it, so it really, the community really helped us think through that whole process in an, in a much more important way. Okay. The other thing that we did is that, you know, we were so busy trying to find the things that we can measure that we can get effects on. And that ah, that was one of the reasons why we left out the self-esteem lessons. We felt that, you know, we weren't gonna be able to get any change in self-esteem in a, in a short term intervention and, and we were, so we, so anyway. The other thing is, is that in right, relying on self report. You see again, we wanted to understand if we've made any ve, any skill development change. We created ah, items to reflect the skills that the kids were learning in terms of problem solving and anger management, depression management, et cetera. But we, again, framed them, and since this is an assessment conference, I think it's important to mention. We framed them in this, this wording that was, you know, the efficacy literature, you know, Bandura stuff. So I am confident that I can, you know, help my friend in a suicidal situation. I mean, I am confident that I can, you know, do this or that. And the point is that so, we didn't get very good self report, report results on the skill items but, but because they were, you know, culturally incongruent, we were asking kids to boast, alright? But, fortunately, then that's one of the things I would say about lot of this work 'coz if we can have multiple measures, then maybe we can learn from our mistakes. And the thing that saved that research was the fact that we had a behavioral assessment as well. So, even though the kids were very humbly se, saying, rating themselves lowly on their ability to do these things, when you looked at the role plays with confederate clients, and you know, a, a, and evaluated by trained Indian writers, uhm, we got very definite treatment effects ah, in, in, with, with the behavioral study. Another problem, ah, you'll see, so after I did this work on suicide prevention, then, you know, then I was asked to apply this life skills work to the prevention of teen pregnancy, violence, and AIDS in ah, two reservation communities in the Midwest. Uhm, there, I was a uhm, a, a consultant. And I think that, ah, one thing that amazed me was how hard it is at times to, to do what you're asked to do but then also realized that there's gonna be a certain contingency in the community that really doesn't think that you should be doing what you're doing, okay? So we would prepare ourselves each time we went out and did workshops and, and ah, intervention work for knowing that probably an elder was going to come and say something rude. Okay. Because we, we were all, all-woman team and we were perceived as feminists. That we're trying, uh, uh, we'll be trying to interfere with some of the natural things in, in, in the community. So that was pretty difficult. And ah, so we were, sort of taking bets on who would be the one to get the hit this time. But we kept realizing, you know, we have to accept it. And that's really what's important to ha, you know, to allow for that, to be ready to hear it and to accept it. And then to try to, you know, and also remember that we were invited in by people. And so there was a certain contingency that felt the, the support in what we were doing. Okay. Another thing is that we then, this pro, this intervention has been used recently on a substance abuse program with early adolescents, okay, in conjunction with parenting skills with the parents. And that was another uhm, project that is very exciting. That's where some of the, the, the, where the data does come from that I'll be sharing in just a minute. But there, we did the classic problem and some of it was due to, sort of uhm, uhm, cultural preferences so to speak. And that is that, uhm, you know, if you look at a lot of the youth development work now, there, there's a lot written and talked about the importance of having Indian voice. I mean not Indian voice, just youth, the voices of youth in the, all phases of the development of the project. And because of the way that the community felt, they didn't want the youth voices. And there again, that was difficult not being a member of the community to try to, sort of, lobby for the teenagers to be involved in it. Ah, it wasn't my place to say what needed to be done. But you know, here again, wha, what I found is that we ended up focusing a lot on the kinds of problems that adults get concerned about in terms of youth resilience, okay, such as, you know, teen pregnancy, violence, AIDS, substance use, et cetera, rather than the problems that the kids were really concerned about. And they were most concerned about their problems at school and different kinds of interpersonal relationships. And we really needed their voices but we couldn't get them. Okay. And another thing that I've real, that, that's been hard for me uhm, in terms of this process of cleaning is to really get clear of the, my disciplinary biases. I mean, I've worked on the interdisciplinary team. I think I know where it should be. They know better. Uhm, it's also very difficult to be asked and to be involved in Indian project and not be the PI. And uhm, you know, in, in field, you know, it really hurt when your ideas are not necessarily uhm, accepted or uhm, you knows, know that you can quickly be replaced as soon as the Indian graduate student is hired on the project. Because the real purpose of being there was just simply to be able to have an Indian person on the team. Okay. So what I just like to share with you is some data that, from, ah, that I've tried to capture in terms of Indian youth resilience. Now, this data comes from uhm, the, the study on the pro, the project using this work in three, ah, three villages that's called The Three-Village Study, because the community does not want, you know, their name or the tribes ah, disclosed. But, but these are three, uhm, tri, three, three tribes or three representatives of three different tribal groups from the same tribe, okay, in the upper Midwest. Alright. Uhm, this was really a neat project in that, uhm, because of the ability to hire people from the community and the resources that were there, people uhm, that were collect, do, were able to do structured interviews with the families. And 87 percent of the, of the community parti, families com, participated in our study. And one of the ways that they did is that, of course, they were ah, approached by the, by a community member that was well-known. Uhm, these people uhm, visited them three times before even asking if they'd participated in interview. And when they did asked, in the, in the homes where it was more traditional and it was appropriate, they did offer tobacco and do it, you know, in, in an, in an important way, respectful way. Okay. So the data that comes from this is a data from, we were able to survey: early adolescents, their parents, and the grandparents. And in cases where grandparents were no longer living, we were able to ah, get then what we called the "mentor parent." And this is someone that's of an older generation that was actively involved at least two or three times a week with the family. So we were wanting to get this generational, uhm, that, that kind of snap shot. Okay. So the data that I'll show ah, today is from the early adolescents. Uhm, there are 212 youth, 97 of them were girls, 115 were boys. They were, they were uhm, enrolled tribal members in the fifth through the eight grade. Their uhm, ages ranged from 10 to 15 with the ah, average age of 12 ah, 12.2 years. Uhm, all of the families, ah, all of the children lived near, o, o, on or near the reservation. Over a third of them lived in single-parent households. Uhm, a third of them had never lived with their biological fathers. And about 32 percent had lived with their biological father at some point in time in their lives but, but not at present. And 34 percent currently lived in a household with their biological fathers. Ah, I can go through the income issues, but let me just say that ah, rather than go into all of the, the levels, uhm, about 22 percents uhm, of the households ah, had incomes of about 35,000 dollars; uhm, 24 percent of the single-parent households had incomes between 20,000 and 35,000. About 18 percent had incomes between 15,000 and 20,000. 12 percent had incomes between 10 and 15 percent. And 23 percent, I'd like to say, oh, excuse me, and over 28 percent of the single-parent households were getting by then less, with less than 10,000 dollars a year. Okay. Uhm, 43 percent of the ah, dual parent and 37 percent of the single-parent household receive food stamps. Uhm, and about ah, 40 percent receive family assistance of some type. Okay. Can we put the first one up? Okay. Now, uhm, we didn't have a measure of resilience but we created one from multiple measures, right? So what we did is we looked at the items on self-esteem, self ah, perceived competence, positive images of self in the view of other persons, school success, and positive school attitude. And I have to say, remember I'm working on interdisciplinary co, team, so I might argue for a full scale but I might be lucky to get three or four items, okay? So this is, uhm, you know, a combination of, of, you know, snippets. And I, uhm, which I guess sociologists tend to do. If you have large numbers, you can live with that, they tell me. Okay. So anyway, this was our self-esteem, con, I mean our resilience construct. Okay. And then what we did is we looked, you know, we wha, uh, ma, my research assistant and uh, Lisa Oliver and I, we come to resilience literature and looked at our code book of all the, of all these different, this data that we had and thought what fits into a resilience model. What do we have that might work, that we might be able to look at, okay? So we looked at, uhm, yup, okay. So this is, great, thank you, very good. Okay. This is the, the ah, regression analysis, or the table for the regression analysis, ah, variables that predicted that construct of resilience that I mentioned a minute, or showed to you a minute ago. And uhm, this ah, combination of significant ah, ones really a, account for about 21.7 percent of the variance. Okay. So what we found is that it was very important for uhm, a parental warmth and, and you'll, let's see here, and angry parenting. Now, the thing, the thing that we did wrong there is that we, we would have done better. And we talked to some people at the Tri-Ethnic Center uhm, at, at Colorado State and they have, you know, we had low outputs on these parenting measures, and we were concerned about that. Ah, fortunately, with the test-retest reliability that, that, that we're a little more confident than we were before. But the problem was that we should never asked them about angry parenting. It should have been just, you know, about our, your family. Okay. So family warmth, right, or uhm, uhm, you know, anger among family rather than asking about parents. Because within the extended family, people, kids were not, felt uncomfortable focusing on just the mother or father or whatever. Okay. Uhm, with the, the item, let's see, on discrimination. There, we actually used about eight, eight items of, or, eight items from an, an existing perceived discrimination scale. And that was another ah, experience that was pretty interesting. I, you know, knowing this ah, in the pre-test results, ah, survey results, I really tried to push an intervention development for doing some work on, uhm, basically on racial socialization and, how, you know, coping and preparing you, you know, youth for the, you know, incidents of discrimination. And certainly in the community mem, meetings, people would talk about that. But then, people didn't wanna deal with it overtly. And they felt that I had a California attitude. And (laughs) it wasn't of, you know, really appropriate. They, you know, would didn't like it but didn't want to become, you know, real uhm, explicit about it. Uhm, and then with the enculturation, uhm, that, that's been very interesting because I've developed an instrument to measure American-Indian bicultural confidence. That is, you know, I've, I've a set, it's, you know, done some validity work nationwide on that. And that was, you know, it really is a, an experience to try to determine what is competence in particular cultures because each community defines competence differently. In the work with the Zuni people, when we were trying to come up with the measure of traditionality, the, uhm, members of the tribal council helped us with items. And in, in looking at that and with the scale that we created, we didn't get ah, traditionality as a predictor of, uhm, a su, you know, or the, the lack thereof, of uhm, a suicidality. And we always thought it was because of the inci, the items that we used. When, and, and basically with the biculturalism, and you know, it's, in some communities where it wouldn't be whether you knew something, it was, did you learn it from the right person within your, you know, within your family system. So I think, you know, the, the, the degree of difficulty is, is different for different communities. Here, ah, people helped us with uhm, a measure that consisted of uhm, traditional activities. So we had about 12 different traditional activities and they were things like of, you know, beating, rising, preparing powwow outfits, going to powwows, cooking certain foods, hunting, et cetera. Another was I, used, we used the, a, a, four items from the Eding and Bubay(ph) Cultural Identification Scale, so that another part of that was cultural identification. And then the third was spirituality, ah, traditional spirituality. And there were certain activities that indicated whether or not you were active in, in, in those practices. Okay. But anyway, it, there's a lot to be said about developing, you know, more sensitive instruments in, in this. But what do we know? We know that parenting is very important. We know that ah, enculturation activities in, in terms of uhm, traditional activities. And certainly, we know that something that is a detractor is that, is, you know, experiencing discrimination or uhm, lack of parental warmth, that kind of thing. So, thank you, okay. Alright. Now, another bit of ah, information I thought you might be interested in, ah, comes from then a study where we looked at the role of enculturation, this involvement in cultural activities and uhm, ah, substance abuse. And the reason we wanted to do this is because of the cultural revitalization that's going on in communities as you know, there's a big, ah, you, you know, everyone assumes that it should really be helpful and we wanted to know. Okay. So what do we find here? This is uhm, this, basically what we found ah, you know, you can't see it from this but let me just walk you through it and I'm sorry. But at least, you'll see that it was a path analysis, okay? Uhm, this, ah, the uhm, circle to, in your left inside, embedded in there, is enculturation, alright? And we found that this was positively associated with discrimination, which is the circle on top. Okay. And ah, and with school competency. So, the more involved in cultural activities, the more likely that you would perceive discrimination. You might be more sensitive to discrimination and from the surrounding area. Okay. And also eh, eh, enhance school competency. Okay. In turn, discrimina, discrimination though was positively associated with substance abuse. So as people experience more discrimination, they tended to self-medicate to deal with the hurt feelings of that. Okay. And school competency was negatively. This is a negative here, associated with substance abuse. Okay. So this is kinda like an indirect effect, as we see it, you know, of enculturation in looking at this work. Okay. Age, the age of the adolescent was positively associated with experiencing discrimination. As kids got older, they exper, they, they perceive more discrimination. And as they got older, they drink more and negatively associated with school competencies. So as they got older, the did less well in school; and they were less involved in, in cultural activities. Okay. So we can say more about it but that's really the, the competency. Okay, that's it. Okay. So from of, getting back to our, you know, sort of preparing for ceremony, I really only gotten through the first phase which was the cleaning phase, because as far as you can see, there's a lot to, (laughs) there's a lot to clean up here. And maybe it's just because I'm being very critical but I think that's what we have to do if we're gonna do a good work. Okay. The second phase, if I can go back to our model from ah, from ah, Joey Thomas, is that of organization, organizing. And if you think about it, whenever we ah, say clear off our desktop or clean our apartment after a week or two of not doing at or even if we re-pot plants ah, from outgrown containers, what we're doing is we're really creating a new environment. And that's what I'm trying to do with this. I'm saying this was a great experience. It was a good way to begin but I really wanna start new. I wanna start fresh. I wanna do things right this time. Okay. And I think it's really important that we, you know, as psychologists realize that uhm, you know, tha, that we have this, this negative and a lot of disciplinary biases, and that we need to reorganize that, that thinking. And I, I, I, I, I found I think a way that helps me with resilience. If you think about it, rather than go to a target focus all the time, think of all the people that you know that are really working on positive youth development by home schooling your kids, or really emphasizing a lot of work in family activities. They're not thing, let's not focus on problems. Let's just really strengthen what we have going on here. Well, Dr. Terry Cross, who is, is, the direct, the Founding Director of the ah, Northwest Indian Child Welfare Association uhm, and helped with the, the book on positive Indian parenting, recently gave a speech in which she talked about an Indian definition of resilience as having four parts, there's always four parts. Okay. Context, mind, body, and spirit. And that balance among all these four parts is necessary in order to re-achieve harmony. Ah, the first one is context. And he said oppression creates an environment where survival skills are developed and sharpened. Histories and heritage provide an anchor. Relatives form systems of care that are interdependent and system reliant. Healthy indep, interdependence where everyone contributes in the same way without expecting reciprocity is the core of extended families. Support and help cycle through the family and resilience is supported by role models, especially elders, community norms, religious structures, and natural helper or healers. He also talks about the quadrant of mind. Resilience is supported intellectually by traditional storage and self talk which emphasize the coping perspective. Stories about how others have managed teach strategies for interacting with the world. The coping skills displayed by many characters in these stories encourage resiliency. Story telling instills the values of relationship, restraint, discipline, survival, and the hard work for little return. This form of the oral tradition is an essential teaching resource for communicating information about identity, values in life. And the provide role models, subtle expe, expectations, and psychological mechanisms for surviving oppression. Body. This is another quadrant he is talking about another important part. Kinship serves as the body within which the individual exists and resilience is developed within family structures and roles. The manner in which relatives interact within the kinship system greatly influences balance. Fathers provide part of the balance within a family, that's obviously from a male perspective. The paternal role can contribute strength to the family system whether the father is present at home or not. Families are better able to be resilient if fathers positively contribute to family functioning. Family norms about eating and drinking together can strengthen or sometimes act against harmony. And then finally spirit. In the spiritual domain, both positive and negative learned practices influence resilience. Positive aspects of spirituality include faith, prayer, meditation, healing ceremonies, and positive thinking. Whereas, negative aspects to spirituality include curses, the evil eye, bad medicine, sin, the promotion of chaos, maladaptive cognitions, and perpetuation of confusion. Spiritual beliefs and practices provide necessary energy needed to face adversity. Natural spiritual forces challenge and strengthen the family. Okay. So basically, I'm trying to figure out and I suppose that you are as well, how would you measure these ah, you know, these quadrants of resilience. There are ways to do that. And how can we work at keeping them all in, you know, in uhm, you know, of, in, in balance so that one would have harmony. And from a traditional perspective, I don't think we're gonna get very far ah, in terms of developing interventions for youth if we don't ignore that really underlying, underpinning desire of a lot of the traditional communities for this kind of work. Okay. Right. Now I guess I would say that we as psychologists, you know, if you look at the field, we've been very good at individual interventions and strengthening, you know, family protective mechanisms. And it seems that we need to do a lot of work on how to, sort of, uhm, empower communities. Ah, Carolyn Attneave certainly did a lot of work in that area. But how do we help support protective social environments? And one way, you know, of course is helping the idea of, promote the idea of including caring, you know of, a caring adult whether they are family member or not. Working in terms of collective self efficacy and helping to activate community engagement. Uhm, just a little bit more. The third phase in terms of remember and reuniting if you can, if you wanna do that today. I think it's really important that we, in ceremony, recognize and remember those people that have contributed to a collective ah, vision. And remember our loved ones and our respected elders and various important role models that we have. They represent the core of the traditions that we have. By remembering them and reuniting with them, we continue the ultimate expression of respect of those who have come before us, influenced us and enriched our lives. And by remembering and reuniting, we effectively fused the strength and beauty of our past with the hopes of our future. Now, when Joey was doing this with the students at Stanford, he made them all ride home or call home in one week. That was their task, that was their homework assignment. It was amazing to hear what the students, you know, talked about and how excited they were, you know, to talk about you know, what they, what they had learned and what they had done. And uhm, for some, they needed a prompting. I thought that was kind of funny but anyway. But to illustrate the importance of remembering and reunited from ah, ah, an Indian adolescent perspective, I'd like to share with you what uhm, a former Ms. Indian USA. Her name was, at the time she was 18 years old and her name was Shenoaba Stilwell(ph) talked about in reference to her grandparents. Uhm, she said, "My maternal grandpa, Nav, Navajo grandparents contributed to my enlightenment and thought me how to walk in beauty in these two worlds, Navajo and French-Canadian. I cherish the memories of a simple lifestyle as a part of my upbringing without electricity or running water on the reservation, I still call home. I was thought the ancient yet everlasting link to my past. The Navajo language which I'm ho, honored to speak today. Sadly, I lost the lives of my grandparents, yet, I have not lost sight of their teachings. In honor of their songs, I sing them. In remembrance of their lives I practice their values. In memory of their wisdom of the past, I share it for everyone's future. In living their way of life, I respect tradition." So I'd like to encourage you as you're on your way back home or, you know, thinking about the next step after this conference to think about the different mentors, and family members, and people that had been very good, close, personally supports you for your personal and your professional pursuits. Because without those people, you wouldn't be enjoying the success that you have today. I'd like you just to reunite with them in your mind and offer them some thanks for their support of your efforts and aspirations. In a reliatis, in a related sense, I think it's important for us to think about the colleagues that we have uhm, who have helped us carve the path of psychology that really is more culturally responsive today than in the past. And certainly in your brochure, you, you know have a memorial to a very wonderful woman, Dr. Martha Bernal who was, ah, through the epitome of modeling resilience when she went through in her bouts with cancer. She worked very diligently to help promote the understanding of the barriers that various students and faculty of color experience in predominantly White institutions. Ah, certainly, her research on uhm, the ethnic identity of Mexican-American children stimulated the need to expand our understanding of group-specific identity beyond the foundational work that Janet Helms and, and Bill Cross had done. Another person I'd like to men, to remember is Carolyn Attneave, who is the founder of network therapy and contributed a lot to understanding of empowering communities. And finally, I'd like to mention Robert Sundance. Many of you may not have heard of him but he is, was a reformed alcoholic and former ah, resident of Skid Row in Los Angeles. He died of AIDS. But before his death, ah, during his period as reformed alcoholic, he was very influential in influencing people in the city, it(ph), city leaders about the importance of having prevention ah, center in downtown L.A., and especially in(ph) programs for, for Indian youth. The final stage, prayer and meditation. This phase of ceremony involves being in harmony with the host of life, ah, the great spirit in Indian ways, or God, or Allah, or however you envision and respond to your own sinner and life force. Now, it's a personal activity, I certainly don't need to tell you what to do in terms of your prayer. But in closing I'd like to ask that you pray in your own way and meditate on the issues about resilience that I've discussed, and the various issues that come out. My intentions in this presentation has centered on the desire that I acquire balance and resilience necessary to truly be a servant of our people. And that is to help move America to a higher moral ground that has a more inclusive world view. As psychologists, I believe that we must embrace the pressing need for appropriate research and assessment methods for those whose culture, race, or lifestyle is different from US mainstream culture. We must recognize the need for each of us to be prepared to respond sensitively and skillfully to ethnic, cultural, and religious diversity. The story that we create for cultural appreciation in psychology will include the mutual story lines inherent in our historical and cultural legacies. And they'll help us rise from social isolation to collective strength. Reaffirming the power of our cultural diversity when that diversity is unified. I hope we can work together towards that goal. Thank you.
