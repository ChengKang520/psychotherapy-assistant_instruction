00:00:30
DAVID ANDERSON HOOKER Hello! My name is David Anderson Hooker. I'm an Associate Professor of conflict transformation at the Eastern Mennonite University Center for Justice and Peacebuilding. In an earlier life, I was a system Attorney General for the State of Georgia who I represented both the Departments of Juvenile Justice and the Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services. It was there that I was first exposed to the concepts of restorative justice. And today, I'd like to talk to you a bit about the basics of restorative justice. 

00:01:00
What Restorative Justice is NOT... Criminal Justice Vindication through... Pain Punishment Isolation Marginalization Retributive Justice Restorative Justice seeks... Vindication through... Increased understanding of impact of actions ...with an active effort to right the harms Address root causes of harmful action 

00:01:00
DAVID ANDERSON HOOKER To better understand restorative justice, it's usually helpful to start by understanding what restorative justice is not. Most of us are familiar with the criminal justice system in which vindication is sought through the imposition of pain, punishment, isolation or marginalization. This is retributive justice. Restorative justice on the other hand seeks to establish the same vindication but through an increase understanding of the impact of actions with an active effort to right the harms and to address the root causes of harmful action. It's also helpful to understand that restorative justice is not a program or a particular practice. 

00:01:45
Restorative Justice Goals Pillars Principles Practices 

00:01:45
DAVID ANDERSON HOOKER Restorative justice is really best understood by learning the goals, the pillars, the principles and a few of the practices that have been used to implement restorative efforts. So let's consider first the goals then the pillars and principles of restorative justice. 

00:02:05
Goals Key decisions into the hands of those affected Make justice healing/transformative Reduce likelihood of future events Harms and Needs Obligations Engagement 

00:02:05
DAVID ANDERSON HOOKER Restorative justice has three fairly simple goals. To put key decisions into the hands of those who are most affected, to make justice more healing possibly even transformative and to reduce the likelihood of future harms. So these are the goals of restorative justice. The pillars of restorative justice are threefold. Harms and needs, obligations and engagement. In restorative justice, it's understood that violations or harms that are done create needs. These needs in turn establish obligations and those obligations have to be addressed by those who are best position to fulfill those obligations and so, we seek engagement of all the stakeholders who have the capacity and responsibility to fill those obligations. 

00:03:00
Who is involved? Restorative vs. Criminal In Criminal Justice... Harm is against State or Government State Official Prosecutor Judge Jury 

00:03:00
DAVID ANDERSON HOOKER So consider, who would be involved in a restorative justice process in comparison with your typical criminal justice process. In a criminal justice process, the harm is considered to be a harm against the state or the government, so you would have a state official, a prosecutor, a judge and possibly a jury determining the truth of the matter and then imposing a sentence of some sort, some form of punishment either isolation, marginalization or some other form of pain and punishment. 

00:03:45
In Restorative Justice Who are the participants? Victim Person who did the harm Community Group that is harmed Group who has obligations/capacity to fill the needs created 

00:03:45
DAVID ANDERSON HOOKER In a restorative justice process, not only would the victim of the harm participate but the person who did the harm would also participate and representatives of the community or the group that has often also been harmed or damaged, and the group that has obligations and capacity to help fill the needs created. All of these would be actively involve to the extent possible in a restorative justice process. 

00:04:15
Harms Needs Harm creates needs and obligations Seeks to create engagement with all those who have a stake ...in making it right 

00:04:20
DAVID ANDERSON HOOKER So restorative justice looks not just that harms but at needs. Notices that the harm creates both needs and obligations and then seeks to create engagement of all of those who would have a stake in making it right. In addition to the goals and pillars of restorative justice, what helps to distinguish restorative process was from other processes are the principles of restorative justice. 

00:04:45
5 Principles of Restorative Justice Seek to put right the harm Criminal = what punishment or sanction Restorative Justice = identify harms What will it take to make those harms right? What would it take to fill the obligations created by the violation? Seek to put right the harm Focus on harms and needs of "victims" ... and the needs of the community and the "offender" Criminal process: harm is done against the state School-based process: harm is violation of a school rule Restorative Justice focuses on harms and needs of the victim Also of community and the offender 

00:04:45
DAVID ANDERSON HOOKER There are five primary principles of restorative justice. As a primary principle of restorative justice, we seek first to put right the harm. In a typical criminal justice or retributive justice process, the idea is to determine what punishment or sanction a wrong doer what deserved. In restorative justice, the primary focus is to identify what harms had been done and then determine what would it take to make those harms right? What would it take to fill the obligations created by the violation? So the first principle is to seek to put right the harms. The second principle of restorative justice is to focus on harms and subsequent needs of victims and also those of the community and the offender. In a typical criminal process, it is understood that the harm is done against the state. In a school-based process, it's understood that the harm is a violation of a school rule. In restorative justice, we focus on the harms and subsequent needs of the victim, also those in the community and the needs of the offender. The restorative justice third principle of restorative justice is to address the obligations that arise from the harm. This is where accountability comes into play. Often people think restorative justice is not about accountability but simply about improving relationships and yet a central aspect of restorative justice is accountability. We address the obligations that arise from those harms and yet, what we have learned is that sometimes the person who is doing the harm isn't the only one who is either in a position or capable of filling the obligations and so, we looked to the broader community and institutions that can help to fulfill the obligations. 

00:06:55
Use of inclusive and collaborative processes Involve those with a legitimate stake in the outcome 

00:06:55
DAVID ANDERSON HOOKER The fourth obligation is to use inclusive and collaborative processes and finally we seek to involve to the extent possible. All of those with the legitimate stake in the outcome. Many times in restorative justice process is you have a victim, their family, members of the broader community, as well as the offender with some supporters and institutional representatives, all of whom would had a stake in the outcome and then working together in an inclusive and collaborative way, they seek to fill the obligations that were created by the harms. One of the easiest ways to see and appreciate the difference between criminal or retributive justice and restorative justice is to consider the primary guiding questions that determine the work. 

00:07:55
In Criminal or Retributive Justice... In Criminal or Retributive Justice... What law or rule was broken? Who is responsible? What punishment do they deserve? 

00:07:55
DAVID ANDERSON HOOKER In criminal or retributive justice, there are three primary questions. What law or rule was broken? Who is responsible for the breaking? And what punishment do they deserve? Fairly simple and straightforward compare to that with the guiding questions for restorative justice. 

00:08:15
Who has been hurt? What are their needs? What will it take to put it right? Whose obligations are these? What has a stake in the situation? What is the appropriate process in including all of the stakeholders in putting it right? 

00:08:15
DAVID ANDERSON HOOKER Who has been hurt? What are their needs? Or what will it take to put it right? Whose obligations are these? Who has a stake in the situation? And what is the appropriate process to include all the stakeholders in putting it right? Let's consider an example in a school and community setting in which retributive justice and restorative justice will point us to very different outcomes. Imagine there were two friends riding home on a public bus, teasing, got out of hand and one student called the other in inappropriate name. She subsequently goes home, tells her boyfriend who enters the school and threatens to do harm to the young man who had spoken ill at her. In a restorative justice process, who would be involved? Certainly, the school would have to be involved because the community had been impacted by the threat. The young lady, the young man who had been threatened and the young man doing the threatening would all be involved. And an in, in an even broader community process, this may also at times involve the parents and others. But a restorative justice which seeks to include representatives from the community, from society as well as the victims and offenders can be accomplished in just this way. So let's take a look as the possible victim, the possible offender and the community as representative by the principal and teacher are all gather together and considering what might be approaches to resolving the harm. In the following example, we'll join the students and the teacher and principal in process. It's important to know that often before conferencing of this sort, there would be individual pre-conferences where each individual as the opportunity to understand and to some extent be able to speak to their understanding of the harm, the impact and the circumstance so that when they are together, they are better able to discuss what harms have occurred, what needs and obligations there are and who has responsibility and capacity to make it right. 

00:11:30
Pre-conference 1 (possible "victim") 

00:11:35

And then that's when he like try to stand up for him-- for her. And then, uhm, I was like, "Okay, then what's up?" and he like he, he try to go ahead and then let's go.

00:19:00
MS. NOAH And at that point, did you think he was going calling you bitch for no reason? 

00:19:05
AMBER Yeah, at that point that he was just like I'd-- cuz I thought he knew that. I was just like I were-- I mean, I'd met-- I was kind of phrasing the questions and I wouldn't put someone down but I don't think as how much to him would be like you bitch like... 

00:19:20
MS. NOAH And so, when he called you a bitch what did you do? 

00:19:25
AMBER I was just shocked because I thought like I, I thought we were cool like I thought when could talk to each other like that so I don't know. 

00:19:35
MS. NOAH Okay, I heard that when he did that you went off on him. 

00:19:40
AMBER Yeah. 

00:19:40
MS. NOAH Yeah? 

00:19:40
AMBER Yeah. 

00:19:40
MS. NOAH Okay. So that's the different then? 

00:19:45
AMBER Yeah. 

00:19:45
MS. NOAH And did nothing here. So clearly if he was calling your name and then you restart respondent strongly again, it's pretty clear that you would got under his skin and he was hurt. 

00:20:00
AMBER Yeah. 

00:20:00
MS. NOAH Yeah, so then you told your boyfriend's name is I'm sorry? 

00:20:05
AMBER Ricky(ph). 

00:20:05
MR. SMITH Uh-huh. 

00:20:05
AMBER So when I told Ricky(ph) and I thought he was just-- I thought he was like done and over with like I thought Ricky(ph) were just like-- I thought Ricky(ph) just text him over just say hey or like you know, please respect her and stuff but... 

00:20:20
MS. NOAH Wha-- what did you really think Ricky(ph) was gonna do? 

00:20:20
AMBER That I've-- 

00:20:25
MS. NOAH Come on. 

00:20:25
AMBER Okay, we're on the way like... 

00:20:30
MS. NOAH Cuz I knew you well enough. You, you know if-- well, I don't wanna answer it for you. You tell me what did you really think Ricky(ph) was gonna do when you told him? Did you tell Ricky(ph) what you done? 

00:20:45
AMBER Not really. 

00:20:45
MS. NOAH Uhm, uh-hmm. 

00:20:45
AMBER I just told him that I'm was asking him questions and, and... 

00:20:50
MS. NOAH So if maybe you tell if say-- if you-- is she went and told you and if--or your girlfriend told you she didn't tell you what you done, what would you? 

00:21:00
MR. SMITH I respond to show you that I care for you. And I think that maybe though sometimes or a way people wanna do it. 

00:21:10
MS. NOAH Is there a possibility you wanted him to come to your rescue and you didn't give him all the information? 

00:21:15
AMBER Yeah. 

00:21:15
MS. NOAH Did you know that you were gonna cause a problem between the two of the boys? 

00:21:25
AMBER Well, I mean I... 

00:21:25
MS. NOAH So see I get that you think this is so funny. 

00:21:30
AMBER Yeah. 

00:21:30
MS. NOAH Cuz I, I get that you thought you were teasing him and... 

00:21:30
AMBER Yeah, like I didn't, I didn't think it was gonna hurt him like I thought it was gonna be like I thought Manny wasn't really like okay like just tell her not to... 

00:21:40
MS. NOAH That really what you thought. 

00:21:45
AMBER That's what I was hoping. 

00:21:45
MS. NOAH That was it, yeah. Okay, so now that you have time to think about this - 

00:21:50
AMBER Uhm-huh. 

00:21:50
MS. NOAH - now, what do you think about what happen? What did you think you did that you could have done differently? 

00:22:00
AMBER I think that I could have just minded my own business and not... 

00:22:05
MS. NOAH So go back to Friday when you noticed, uhm, that Manny(ph) was annoyed and getting teased from your teasing what do you think you could have done? 

00:22:20
AMBER I could have stopped when I noticed it. 

00:22:20
MS. NOAH And if you are really friends and you noticed he was annoyed, what could you have done? Oh, my god! 

00:22:30
AMBER Yeah, like I could it estimate it. I could have said sorry to him enough and you... 

00:22:35
MS. NOAH Okay, so that's the first right thing you could have done. Then, when you told Ricky(ph)... 

00:22:45
AMBER Uhm-huh. 

00:22:50
MS. NOAH Could you stopped it somewhere it between when you told Ricky(ph) and what happened upstairs in the hall today? 

00:22:55
AMBER I could have told Ricky(ph) the truth. 

00:22:55
MS. NOAH Yeah, okay. So now, we got a big problem cuz now we got Ricky(ph) and Manny(ph) who are really angry, - 

00:23:05
AMBER Uhm-huh. 

00:23:05
MS. NOAH - who on the risk of not being able at the school, who violated the culture of the school. So, sometimes when you make a decision or a bad decision it hurts a lot of people so can you tell me who you think was affected by what you did in this situation? 

00:23:25
AMBER I think a lot of people were affected cuz now you guys are involved and then Ricky(ph) and Manny(ph) like I don't know if their friendship will be the same now. 

00:23:40
MS. NOAH In the four years that you've been at the school, there've been in a fight at the school? 

00:23:45
AMBER Not one like this. Like there has been like oh, she said he said but... 

00:23:50
MS. NOAH Right. So how do you think it affects the culture of the school? 

00:23:55
AMBER I think it puts of-- I think, ah, I don't know how to say it. I like-- I think it puts in bad name on the school cuz I mean, it's, it's kind of like saying that the students don't really care about them very much. 

00:24:10
MS. NOAH So we got Manny(ph) and Ricky(ph) in the other room. 

00:24:10
AMBER Uhm-huh. 

00:24:10
MS. NOAH We go to figure out how we fix this. Uhm, one of the ways that we would like to try as if everybody is ready, uhm, to get everybody together because you have some repair to do before they can be repaired. 

00:24:25
AMBER Yeah. 

00:24:25
MS. NOAH Because they are still thinking that this battle is between them because they're trying to honor you, right? 

00:24:35
AMBER Yeah. 

00:24:35
MS. NOAH Cuz your boyfriend is trying to demand respect for you. So, would you be willing to tell them what you now had figured out happened? 

00:24:45
AMBER He's gonna be mad of it. 

00:24:50
MS. NOAH Uhm. 

00:24:50
AMBER Yeah. I guess I have too in order to make things right. I guess, yeah. 

00:24:55

00:25:00
MR. SMITH Yeah, and then we'll talk to them and they'll just stay right here until we figure out what they wanna do is well, okay? 

00:25:05
AMBER Okay. 

00:25:05
MS. NOAH Okay. Let's go. 

00:25:10
Pre-conference 3 (possible "offender's" boyfriend)

MS. NOAH Huh, react. Are you okay? 

00:25:20
RICKY Yeah. 

00:25:20
MR. SMITH Okay, do the talk. 

00:25:20
MR. SMITH What happen out there? 

00:25:25
RICKY Oh, just she told me that they got off the bus and Manny(ph) called her bitch. And I was like, the heck or nobody calls my girl bitch especially Manny(ph). 

00:25:35
MR. SMITH And Manny(ph) just came up no reason and called her a bitch? 

00:25:35
RICKY Yeah, it was as fast as I know and you know, I don't know what happened, right. She was just like, "Manny(ph) called me a bitch," so you know, Manny(ph) does that. 

00:25:45
MS. NOAH So what did you do? 

00:25:45
RICKY Uhm, well I just wanna talk to him just he was up you know, tell him that you know, isn't that cool like no one is-- or like that. 

00:25:55
MS. NOAH So did you go to his class? 

00:25:55
RICKY Yeah. 

00:25:55
MS. NOAH Or just outside the hall? 

00:25:55
RICKY No, I went to his class, "Hey, I'm gonna talk to you," and pulled him out and you know. 

00:26:05
MR. SMITH How do you think he felt when you did that? 

00:26:05
RICKY Ah, I don't know. I'm a free scary dude so he partly-- he was quite scared, maybe little suprised. I don't know. 

00:26:15
MS. NOAH And so you just told me you wanted to talk to him? 

00:26:15
RICKY Yeah, I was just like, "Hey man, I need to talk to you," like asap and so... 

00:26:20
MS. NOAH And how he respond to that? 

00:26:25
RICKY He just knew that kind of surprised to be that like-- you kind of like you just caught of you was like, "What?" So... 

00:26:30
MS. NOAH When you asked him if that he-- if he called your girlfriend a bitch? Did you ask him or did you accuse him? 

00:26:35
RICKY No, I just told him that like, "Hey, why are you calling my girlfriend a bitch?" 

00:26:40
MS. NOAH Did he tell you why? 

00:26:45
RICKY No, he was just like, "What?" and then he just close the other things like, "What? What are you talking about?" 

00:26:50
MR. SMITH Do you understand why he might have done that? 

00:26:50
RICKY Not really. 

00:26:55
MR. SMITH Okay, and the only thing that Amber(ph) said to you was what? 

00:26:55
RICKY That they got off the bus and he called her a bitch. 

00:27:00
MR. SMITH Okay. 

00:27:00
MS. NOAH So, she tell you anything that might have happened at classroom to cover that? 

00:27:10
RICKY No, I just remem-- she just told me that they were sitting together in the bus. 

00:27:10
MS. NOAH Are you friends? 

00:27:10
RICKY As far as I know you know, he's cool-- he was cool with me but I don't know now. So... 

00:27:20
MS. NOAH So you have no idea why? 

00:27:20
RICKY Uh-hmm. 

00:27:25
MR. SMITH So sometimes our girlfriend reacts differently, right? 

00:27:25
RICKY Yeah. 

00:27:25
MR. SMITH So maybe this was one of those dull moments. Do you think Manny(ph) would just call your girlfriend a bitch? 

00:27:35
RICKY I mean, I thought he was cool but... 

00:27:40
MR. SMITH So you have no idea why Manny(ph) reacted the way you did? 

00:27:45
RICKY As far as I know. 

00:27:45
MS. NOAH So as far as you-- he just got off the bus and did that for no reason? Okay, so what I can tell you is that we've had the same meeting, uhm, with Amber(ph), she's in the other room and she was able to share with us her part in this. Uhm, she was teasing him. She teased him on the bus on Friday to the point that she totally frustrated him and when she knew he was frustrated, she kept going and he got off the bus and muttered under his breath. She's acting like and, and she turned around and went off on him. So she didn't tell you the full story which is why - 

00:28:30
MR. SMITH Yeah. 

00:28:30
MS. NOAH - Mr. Smith(ph) kinda felt like you've been played in this. I think she was trying to see what you're reaction with it. Now she's admitted her piece in it. She knows what she did wrong. Uhm, she's wanting to, uhm, make things right. So there is some things that need to be repaired and we need to be sure that you're ready to show up in a different way, uhm, and we need to hear from you that you understand what you're part was in this. So, uhm, what did you do that you could have done differently even if you didn't know anything just that she told you. What could you have done differently? 

00:29:10
RICKY Well, I could have ask her something you know, were-- why did he called you that word? 

00:29:15
MS. NOAH Good though. What could you have done differently with Manny(ph)? 

00:29:15
RICKY I could have talked to him a little nicer in a way that it not like approach him so crazy. 

00:29:25
MS. NOAH Cuz you guys were friends, right? So is there a possibility that you could have just had a different kind of a conversation? 

00:29:35
RICKY Yeah. 

00:29:35
MS. NOAH Uh-hmm. So... 

00:29:35
MR. SMITH What do you think needs to happen? 

00:29:40
RICKY And then we'll go apologize to him-- to Manny(ph). 

00:29:45
MR. SMITH Would be willing to meet with Manny(ph) and with Amber(ph). 

00:29:45
RICKY Yeah. Uhm, yeah. 

00:29:50
MR. SMITH Cuz we don't wanna put you in the situation you're not comfortable with. 

00:29:55
RICKY I feel like I hold off with Amber(ph) cuz it's pretty mess of... 

00:30:00
MS. NOAH Cuz she's willing to join to him and one of the purposes is you know, to figure out everybody's part in this and I think the only way to do the repair, it sounds to me like there some things you need from her - 

00:30:15
MR. SMITH Uh-hmm. 

00:30:15
MS. NOAH - to repair what happened? So what I think we are asking as if you're willing to give her that opportunity. She's wanted to come to the table to make repair. Are you willing at this point to allow that to happen? 

00:30:25
RICKY I can try. I don't know. 

00:30:30
MS. NOAH Okay, and that's all we're asking. 

00:30:30
RICKY Yeah. 

00:30:30
MR. SMITH Yeah. And I ask you know, fix that issue but I'm hoping that you can hear her voice, she can hear yours and we kindly discuss everything together. 

00:30:40
MS. NOAH Okay, good. Let's move on. 

00:30:40
MR. SMITH All right. 

00:30:45
The Restorative Practice Conference In attendance: School Principal School Vice Principal School Counselor Teacher involved "Victim" "Offender" "Offender's Boyfriend" 

00:31:20
MS. NOAH So I just wanna welcome everybody to the conference. Uhm, we all know each other at this table and I'm really appreciative, appreciative that everybody was willing to come here. Uhm, this is hard work and I know that we all have the same goal in mind why we're here today. Uhm, this conference is confidential and this conference has to be a place where there is no verbal or physical violence and we all have to agree to be here. If at any point in time somebody does not wanna be at the table or a number of people don't want to be at table, we can stop. If you just need a break, we can take a break. If you decide not to be here and resolve the conflict in this way, we can take a more traditional approach. Uhm, we can move to suspensions and possible expulsions or some of the more traditional consequences for these types of actions and behaviors. So, uhm, e-- everybody will speak at one time. You might notice that I'm gonna use this note cards. These note cards help to direct he conference so that, uhm, you all have certain, uhm, questions that will be act-- answer and so that we make sure that everybody's voice is heard. And so, uhm, I wanna remind you that you can terminate this at any time that you-- we hope that you'll stay and participate. So is everybody agree took the terms of the conference? 

00:32:55
 Okay. 

00:32:55
MS. NOAH Great. And before we get started, I also wanna just remind you that I'm facilitating, This is your opportunity to talk to each other, uhm, and, and so I'll try move out of the way as best I can, uhm, but please, please speak to one another. This is your time. We, uhm, we're gonna start it first hearing from Amber(ph) and I would love if you would start by telling us what did you do. 

00:33:25
AMBER Manny(ph) and I were on the bus and when I comes down there I was just boring him. I was, I was harassing him as asking him questions like, what's your nationality, like where did you get your style from, like why do you dress like that and I brought up the fact that he's-- he are older than most of the people on his grade level so he was just like, could you hold back, did you start late like. Now I was just asking him really mean questions like are you diamond stuff and so on. Then, when we got off the bus, he ended up calling me a bitch. 

00:34:00
MS. NOAH Okay. And so, as we go through this and I ask questions, I want it to make sure that you all clear that this is your opportunity, ah, to talk to each other that I'm gonna guide this but, but your conversations are not to me is to each other, okay? 

00:34:15
MS. ANDERSON Uh-huh. 

00:34:20
MS. NOAH Okay, yeah. Okay, so again as you proceed about what you did, please talk to everybody. 

00:34:25
AMBER Uhm, so when we got off the bus he called me a bitch as we all know why we're here, uhm, and I ended bowing up on him. I called him some inappropriate style by was-- I was just starting him saying that I'm gonna tell Ricky(ph) and how Ricky(ph) is gonna get him and that's pretty much what happen on Friday and so then today. 

00:34:50
MS. NOAH So what were you thinking about at that time? 

00:34:55
AMBER In good time. I'd, I'd-- I wasn't really thinking. I just thought it was funny like I don't-- I mean, I thought I, I-- I mean, to him really. 

00:35:05
MS. NOAH Talk to him. 

00:35:05
AMBER I don't really think that it was gonna make you upset or hurt you at all. 

00:35:10
 And do you think about it now? 

00:35:15
AMBER I think that I deserved to be called a bitch like I'd-- I understand where you're coming from like what I said was pretty hurt for like what the whole being year older and your style like I mean, that that's low like I wouldn't done that. 

00:35:30
MS. NOAH And who do you think was affected by what you did? 

00:35:35
AMBER I think everyone was affected. Manny(ph) was affected cuz he was on those being hurt and then Ricky was affected because I lied to him and I gave him false information, and Ms. Anderson was affected cuz she had actually break up the fight, and your affected because you're being part into this situation. And it's like the whole school is affected because that hasn't happened at our school before not if I like this like be out people were just like she says-- he, he said, she said affect me one time but-- I mean- it hasn't really been that intense deeper and so I feel like I just I put a bad name on the school. 

00:36:20
MS. NOAH Why do you think needs to be done to make things right? 

00:36:25
AMBER I think I need to apologize to everyone cuz I, I wasn't thinking when I was talking to you like I was, I was, I was just being a bitch which like I, I didn't think at all. 

00:36:40
MS. NOAH Thank you. And what did you do? 

00:36:45
RICKY I confronted Manny(ph) and I just... 

00:36:50
MS. NOAH A move a bit so you can talk to Manny(ph). 

00:36:55
RICKY I just said little up on you and I, I mean to got to know what's going on. I just-- I thought you just called her a and just because but-- and I know what happened. 

00:37:05
MS. NOAH So what were thinking at that time? 

00:37:10
RICKY I wanted to protect my girl cuz you know, I'm don't like anyone especially when one of friends call my girl a bitch. 

00:37:20
MS. NOAH And what have thought about since the way you're thinking now? 

00:37:25
RICKY I feel pretty stupid like I should have at least asked her you know, why did he call you a bitch and not just you know, go on and blow up. I think if I would have what have changed that, all the situation wouldn't be as bad. 

00:37:40
MS. NOAH And so, who do you think was affected by what you did? 

00:37:45
RICKY I think I've-- did affected everyone like if I did a relationship between Amber(ph) and I because I did trust her as much like we lost trust and Manny(ph) because he was one of my friends and I hurt him. And like the teachers because and like Amber(ph) said we gave a bad name to the school. 

00:38:10
MS. NOAH So what do you think you need to do to make this right? 

00:38:15
RICKY I think I need to apologize to everybody especially Manny(ph) for you know, confronting him like that cuz it's, it's not cool. I know if he did that to me I wouldn't, I wouldn't like it. I'll probably explode. 

00:38:30
MS. NOAH And so once we have an opportunity cuz I'm also hearing you say that you want to apologize and once we have an opportunity to hear from everybody today, uhm, they'll be a time in this meeting later on for you to do that. Okay, so Manny(ph), uhm, how would you react to what happened? 

00:38:50
MANNY Well, when, uhm, Amber(ph) was went up to blow off when we were on the bus she was asking these inappropriate questions and I was trying my hardest to like ignore her and stay quiet because I'm actually like one of those people who actually came blow off really, really easy, so it was hard for me stay quiet. Then when we got off the bus I just like blow off and I called her a bitch. And then that's when she went off on me and she shouted on me that she will going to tell her boyfriend Ricky(ph). I don't know why. I don't really care. So then when he pulled me out of class like were gonna go out and Ms. Anderson(ph) stopped us and then that's when we came down here and had our little meetings. 

00:39:40
MS. NOAH So Manny(ph) what impact does this harm had on you and, and others? 

00:39:45
MANNY Well it really hurt me not because of what she said but, uhm, because she doesn't know like my history, like I grew up in a rough neighborhood where I see drugs and gang affiliation a lot and I'm like actually one of them. Like the only one from my family that actually comes to school and like I'm actually trying to do great in life and it’s hard for me to come to school and then have someone to pick on me cuz then, I don't only have to worry about like my neighborhood but also at school. And school is always like my second home. 

00:40:20
MS. NOAH So what's been the worst thing for you? 

00:40:20
MANNY Uhm, I guess like they're not knowing what I actually go through and picking on me. 

00:40:30
MS. NOAH Okay. So what do you think needs to happen to make things right? 

00:40:35
MANNY Uhm, I think they should apologize because they, they don't really know me like the real. 

00:40:40
MS. NOAH Uh-hmm, okay. Thank you. Mr. Boem(ph), how did you react when you heard what happened? 

00:40:50
MR. BOEM Well, as you as know as the vice principal, I really try and help our school build a culture where we accept each other, accept our differences, uhm, and we get along and that's really important to what our school-- is what our school stands for. And so, when I hear that, uhm, the two guys got into it in the hallway, uhm, and a ver-- you know, physical altercation that really disappoints me and upsets me because that's not the culture we're trying to built here. And I know both of you well and to see you make that choice, uhm, was-- is really hard for me. And to hear how you know, along with that culture we're also trying to really build the culture. We don't bully people. We don't pick up people for being different. And to hear what you-- the kind of questions you asked him and where you put him, uhm, was really tough for me as well. 

00:41:50
AMBER Yeah. 

00:41:50
MR. BOEM Uhm, so I know as a school representative that's really tough and I know it affected a lot of staff members, uhm, administration and, and the teachers when they heard what happened. 

00:42:05
 And what's been the worst part of it for you? 

00:42:05
MR. BOEM Uhm, knowing that the three of you are, are great students and a, a really important part of our school and that you made this choices to, to act up this way. 

00:42:20
MS. NOAH And what concerns to you still have about what happened? 

00:42:25
MR. BOEM Uhm, my concern still are that it's not completely solved that people's feelings are still hurt, that people were wrong to-- that there is trust lost and that if I'm worried that if doesn't get solved that it could lead to more conflict. 

00:42:40
MS. NOAH And what do you think needs to happen to make this right? 

00:42:45
MR. BOEM Uhm, I think those you affected not just each other, hurt each other in many ways but you also, uhm, lost the trust of your teachers, ah, some of the staff and your peers. Uhm, you know, I know Ms. Anderson(ph) was probably affected personally because she had stepped in between, uhm, the two of you and that could be dangerous for someone who step between two people who are physically combative. So, uhm, I'd like to see you guys repair the damage to not only each other but to the rest of your classmates, the teachers and staff that were directly affected. And hopefully your, your choices from this point on will reflect that, uhm, usually the sense that you've, you've done some wrong and you're willing to, to repair it. 

00:43:35
MS. NOAH Thank you, Ms. Anderson(ph)? And how did you react to what happened? 

00:43:45
MS. ANDERSON Well, I was shocked to see students that I've had, uhm, get physical with on another. And it hurts me that in the five years that I've worked here I never had put my hands on a student. It put me in an awkward position, depresses me, hurts me and you guys know that I have the incoming ninth graders for Science and one of the things we talked about is our school culture and now we do no harm. And I feel like you have made me look like a liar because I told the kids that's not what out school is about. And so, to see you two do that to one another hurts me and hurts the school and I don't know how to go forward and say it that's not our school culture. 

00:44:30
MS. NOAH Is that the worst part for you or is there more? 

00:44:35
MS. ANDERSON That's the worst part I feel like I have lied to all of my incoming students and I don't like having to physically get between two students at a school where we believe in doing no harm. 

00:44:55
MS. NOAH And what do you think needs to happen to make things right? 

00:45:00
MS. ANDERSON I mean, I appreciate that I'm hearing that you guys wanna apologize to one another however I think it goes deeper than that because students saw you, staff member saw you, uhm, I saw you and, and the physicality needs to be, uhm, discussed and approach on a way where we repair that visual damage that you guys created in our school culture. And I think that it was a poor example stuff for the freshman especially. And I'm more curious to hear what they have to say about repairing up but I, I think we need to look at it in a, in a bigger scheme because it's beyond just the people at this table. 

00:45:45
MS. NOAH So I'm here and thank you on hearing, uhm, from each of you that there's a need for apology and so maybe this is a good time to start with that first before we talk about, uhm, more ways that we can resolved this. So who would like to say? 

00:46:05
AMBER I'll start and, ah, uhm, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry for putting you in a tough situation like I know you think that the three of us are really good students and, and I know that you may feel like there's been trust that was lost during this lie. And I just wanted to say that I'm sorry for starting all of this. And, and it-- it's not a good image to put on our school and that's on the good image for everyone of us. So, I'm sorry. And, ah, I'm sorry that I was the cause for all of this. Uhm, I get made you get in between two students. I made you get-- I made you break up the fight which is something that you've never had to do at this school. And I'm sorry that I-- I'm sorry that you feel like a liar like that-- that's on me like I just wanted to say that I'm-- I really I'm sorry and it's not, it's not fair to you to have to stop and-- like when in inside that like you could have been put in danger too. Uhm, I'm sorry that you were involved in this cuz this is not our school rules and the fact this has happen really does not represent us all. And Ricky(ph) I just wanted to say that I'm sorry that you lost trust in me like I, I don't know I guess I wanted you to defend me and I'm-- I hope-- I'll do a lot to make things to really get out tell you the truth from beginning to end like I won't lie to you anymore. And I'm sorry that-- I mean, I, I know Manny as your friend. I'm sorry that I put on you this situation. So it's not, it's not fair to you at all. And I love you and I, I feel I mess this up. I'm sorry. And Manny(ph) I just wanted to say that I'm sorry that I said all that stuff to you like I wasn't-- it really was just mean like it would-- I hear it and I don't know you. I don't know your past. I don't know what you've been through. And I hope that you can forgive me because-- ah, I mean, what I said was became my stuff and I agree with you I'm 100% I was being a bitch. I mean-- and I'm-- I really I'm truly sorry. 

00:49:10
MS. NOAH Thank you. 

00:49:15
RICKY I just, I just want to apologize to Manny(ph) cuz you know, we're good friends for since forever you know, and this is-- it wasn't cool. I, I don't mean, I don't mean to do that like I really don't know what's going on and like for me just to go out to you like that it wasn't, it wasn't cool. And Amber(ph) I just-- I don't know what-- I felt pretty down. Hey guys, I still love but you, you know, toward you know. 

00:50:00
MS. NOAH Anyone else? 

00:50:00
RICKY And especially to teachers like, uhm, I'm sorry that you guys see this. I'm sorry that I set a bad example cuz I don't know what I was thinking. I don't we was gonna hurt you guys so much like especially I don't know it was, it was bad. 

00:50:25
MS. NOAH Thank you. So I know this is really hard work, uhm, and your willingness to work it out this way is, is invaluable. Uhm, some of the adults of the table have had an opportunity to listen, to listen to your apologies. And most importantly I want you to be thinking about what we all need to help restore the culture of the school and wanting to be sure that an apology was enough for your or is there something else that you need from them to make things right. It was a good apology, was it? 

00:51:00
MR. BOEM Yeah. 

00:51:05
MS. NOAH And so, for the adult and I know Mr. Smith(ph) as have an opportunity to listen and he's been a part of this conversations, uhm, is there something that you think that needs to be done or that you would like to see done, uhm, to help repair some of the harm that's been done? 

00:51:25
MR. SMITH Yeah, uhm, like we heard earlier is Ms. Anderson(ph), uhm, struggles with the ninth graders and struggles with the idea that, that reputation has been taken away of our school. So I encourage the two of you that wanna apologize to the ninth grade class to work with Ms. Anderson(ph) and figure something out that you guys could do together as a group to be those role models and to give back to, ah, our school community. And I also encourage and challenge you three to maybe be the role model of the school. 

00:52:00
MS. NOAH Is that something you think you could commit too? 

00:52:05
AMBER Yeah. 

00:52:05
MANNY Yeah. 

00:52:05
MS. NOAH Uhm, Mr. Boem(ph) I know when we have this conference too that, that we come together to do this work to repair the damage here but we know when we leave this room, there's a lot of other people out there who are gonna know what happened and where we’re at. Uhm, maybe you can take up something that you need from all of them, uhm, that might help to curve that and see. 

00:52:35
MR. BOEM And you know it-- when disputes and things like this happen, uhm, everyone kinda wants to know what happen, what happen. And I'm gonna ask you as we said earlier, as Ms. Noah have said that is the confidential and that, uhm, when you leave here people ask you about it if you were handling it with, with manner apologies to each other. We're moving on and leave it to that, uhm, that will help reduce in friction that may build up you know, if people or anyone he said this, she said that. Uhm, and then I expect and I hope to see, uhm, because as Ms. Anderson(ph) was saying starts with further damage on the school label. I pretty good faith that you guys are good place of each other at this point, uhm, and I'd like to see it now take what you'd learned here and, and show the rest of school that you are sorry for what you did. That you wanna make it up and regret damage that was done. 

00:53:40
MS. NOAH So is that something that you could commit to what I'm hearing from saying is take a more a leadership or, uhm, in general about creating a better culture in the school. Is that something all of you can agreed to? Ms. Anderson(ph), is there something else that you would like to asked of them? 

00:54:00
MS. ANDERSON No, I think work you know, on it, ah, talking to the ninth graders about our choices and our choices impact one another is the school is definitely something that we can set up and, and look up and especially reinforce in our school believe they're doing no harm. So let's definitely meet and in such had ben after that. I'm okay with that. 

00:54:15
MS. NOAH Okay. So I'm hearing we have commitments on the table to find the time to meet within Ms. Anderson(ph) to figure out how you can now trust them to meet any the confidentiality of the meeting and, uhm, to no get involved to new little fires that maybe out there as you leave the room, right? And to continue working on and exemplifying doing no harm, okay? Anything else anyone would like to add? 

00:54:45
MR. SMITH I just wanna say thank you for everybody being able to take time today to come down here and, ah, be in this process. 

00:54:55
MS. NOAH Thank you. So I think at this point our meeting is concluded and, uhm, again I appreciate your willingness to resolved and repair the hurt that was done today. This is not easy work, uhm, and you should all be very proud of yourselves for continuing down this road and, uhm, we care about each and every one of you and, we're here for you. Okay. Okay.
