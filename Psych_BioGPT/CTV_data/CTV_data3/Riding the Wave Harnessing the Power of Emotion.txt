RICH SIMON Welcome everyone. Welcome to the studios of the Psychotherapy Networker. My name is Rich Simon, I'm the editor of the Networker. I'm your host for this series: Who's Afraid of Couples Therapy? And, so this series has really been concerned with everything they never taught us about doing couples therapy. What we've, most of us have learned in our trainings or even in many workshops is conceptual, highly theoretical, broad models about working with people and this fundamental dimension of the immediate experience, of being a in a room with couples where there can be a lot of emotionality, secrets. There can be a whole range of unpredictability that takes us into a different realm than we've often experienced in these traditional individual therapy can, is, is really a challenge for many of us. We've been addressing a whole range of issues through the series, and today we're really looking, taking a look at both a particular model of working with emotions in couples therapy and also a framework for understanding emotionality and really a way of recognizing the role that emotions play, and just biological just in our day to day functioning that articulates some dimensions of emotions that seem especially relevant to psychotherapy and couples therapy. So, my great pleasure to help us on that journey today is Kathryn Rheem who's a practitioner of emotionally focused couples therapy, and a neighbor, a local therapist and, and I'm very pleased to welcome Kathryn to this series. Kathryn, hello. 

00:02:00
KATHRYN RHEEM Hello, thank you so much for having me. 

00:02:05
RICH SIMON So Kathryn, we've talked a little bit and it sounds to me like your experience coming into the field, and particularly your experience in graduate school, is typical of the experience of many therapists when it comes this dimension of emotion, dealing with emotion in psychotherapy. And I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about in your, what was the attitude about emotion being expressed in psychotherapy sessions and the training that you got as a young therapist in working with emotions in the context of couples or any other kind of clients. 

00:02:40
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah, that's a great starting point Rich. The training I got was really around leaving the emotion out of the therapy room. 

00:02:45
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, yup. 

00:02:50
KATHRYN RHEEM At the time, it was described, emotion was described as chaotic and unpredictable, irrational. If you can't work with it, why let it into the room? Or, since it's hard to work with why let it come into the room? So the therapist's task, among others of course, was to, in a way, prevent or block the emotion from coming into the room. You know, I don't know all the reasons why the fathers of family therapy suggested that or- 

00:03:15
RICH SIMON You just put your finger on it, it was the fathers of family therapy- 

00:03:20
KATHRYN RHEEM Maybe. 

00:03:20
RICH SIMON We guys do have a reputation for not being very fond of expressing our feelings. 

00:03:30
KATHRYN RHEEM Well, that's, it's a good point. Although, as you know, EFT has been shown to work really well with men who consider themselves to be inexpressive. 

00:03:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:03:35
KATHRYN RHEEM And, I do lots of work with military service members who really have been trained to shut down emotionally to complete the mission, to go down range. And, but come home and have needed to build some flexibility so they can be emotionally responsive, and they're able to do it. We, these highly trained, mostly male, service members learn to open up emotionally to a degree in order to connect with their partner and their children, and there's some relief for them in not having to stay inexpressive or shut down. 

00:04:10
SIMON RICH So, one of the, that, there's Allan Schore who's a- 

00:04:10
KATHRYN RHEEM Yes. 

00:04:15
SIMON RICH Psychiatrist that's well known for his work on, on the brain interpersonal neurobiology. He's coined this term, the "Emotional Revolution"- 

00:04:20
KATHRYN RHEEM Yes. 

00:04:25
SIMON RICH To characterize this whole shift that's taking place in our field, as in this, looking at this dimension, this implicit dimension, this nonverbal dimension of our experience and brining that more and more into the forefront. So let's, let's talk a little bit. EFT in particular, as a theory of psychotherapy, has a lot to say about emotion and, really I guess, the centrality of emotion in human experience. So, from the viewpoint as a, as a emotionally focused couples therapist tell us about what are, what are some of the hallmarks of these, that, that the, the theory of emotion and role of emotion in human experience and then later on we'll get to more of these, these issues of being in the treatment room and techniques of psychotherapy. But just, why is emotion so important? 

00:05:15
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah, well in EFT emotion is the agent of change, the target for change. The, you know, attachment. As you know, EFT is based on Adult Attachment Theory and secure attachment gives one, an individual as well as a relationship, emotional flexibility. And so, emotion is primary and, as you know from electronics research, in key moments of distress, interpersonal or relationship distress, those strong emotions take precedence verilogically(ph). And so, it, it's important, it's vital for us as clinicians to work with the force that takes precedence. So it's emotion, emotion is the agent and target of change and it's the leading element. It's our best GPS, and so, you know, Daniel Goleman said, “…we are rudderless in life without connection [with] our emotion." And we talk about it as an orienting system. Emotion is an information processing system, it signals to us our fit between our environment and our needs. It tells us what's important, organizes our interactions, helps us feel what's important to us, are our needs being met? And then helps us express the clearer signals to our loved ones, to the people who matter the most. And so, we really talk about emotions as a signaling system, signaling to ourselves as well as to our partners and family members, about what we need, what we're going through, and sending clearer signals is the ultimate. That's what we're working towards in EFT, the, and couples who are distressed, the signals they send each other have gotten really scrambled. It's hard to even know what's being said, what's being shared, hard to interpret, often misunderstood. Sometimes the signals are even ignored or dismissed and in EFT we're really working to slow down the emotional signals sent so that they can be descrambled and clarity(ph), so that what, what is needed is actually expressed and then heard and received by the listening partner. We support- 

00:07:20
SIMON RICH So, yeah. Part, part of just, just underline what you're saying. So part of, it seems, one of these, the shifts in the vocabulary of the profession is this, that therapy is more and more discussed and, at least when I hear it, is, describe the goal of therapy is often talked about as affect regulation, certainly rather than our old notions about insight or, perhaps from your, your traumatizing graduate school days of the ferretting out of dysfunctional cognitions. And this focus on, on the, the, the belief that more and more, as we become able to measure the brain, it seems, that more and more of this implicit nonverbal dimension rather than being, kind of, the static surrounding these, these very clear notions that are the father's, and perhaps the mothers as well, various schools of psychotherapy made to central. It has more and more come to the forefront as being the, the primary focus of psychotherapy. 

00:08:20
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah, I think Allan Schore's, you mentioned Allan Schore, I think his research has highlighted that. I think the latest Neuroscience has highlighted that. There's studies from the medical field that have backed this up. The importance of emotion and secure attachment, and what it does to the individual, immune system functioning, cardiovascular health, as well as to the relationship dynamic, and how when we have a secure bond we head out into the world with more confidence, more self-esteem, less depression, anxiety. We feel better in our own skins knowing we're loved. Even when we make a mistake, or even when we take a risk and it might not go so well, we know we're loved. We can turn to our loved one and they'll help antidote our worst fears. They'll help antidote our fears, our anxieties, about what we could've, would've, should've done. Or any mistakes- 

00:09:05
SIMON RICH Yup. 

00:09:10
KATHRYN RHEEM We might have made. In EFT, you know, we take advantage of our emotional expression for the client's benefit. We don't run from the emotions, we, we don't worry about intense emotionality. Sure, it can be uncomfortable, sure it can be hard to contain and slow down, but that emotional intense, intensity or chaos, even, can be really a rich source of meaning and data for the, for the EFT therapist. And so, you know, knowing EFT is, for me, like having the most relevant toolbox when it comes to emotions expressed between partners in intimate relationship, and, you know, we really want to harness the power. We want to glean the intelligence from the emotion rather than even just containing emotion and, and kind of, maybe, even placing on the side, you know, we acknowledge it but we don't, you know, we don't give it priority. Well in EFT, we give it priority, we're glad it's in the room, and sometimes the struggle with EFT clinicians is what do we do when there's not enough emotion in the room? 

00:10:05
SIMON RICH Uh-huh, yeah. 

00:10:10
KATHRYN RHEEM You know, being in experiential therapy and being humanistic, it's like, we want to come alongside our client's emotion and reflect it for them and join them in it. I heard Siegel say recently that, you know, one of the better definitions of empathy was to temporarily, to a small degree, take on another's experience. And that's, that's a foundation of EFT, is empathetic attunement reflectiveness. We want to join, temporarily and to a small degree, we want to join with our clients and their strong emotion. Maybe for the first time in their lives somebody has actually come alongside them in it rather than pathologized(ph) it, or just told them they're making mountains out of molehills, or they're just reacting, or they're being witchy(ph), or, even worse, you know, there's a label from the DSM we could throw their way. And, and so it's, it, what we're really about, helping, you know, as Bowlby said, "All human behavior make sense in context." And that's certainly true about the emotional experience. 

00:11:05
SIMON RICH So, in a moment let's, let's get to, kind of the, how that get operationalized. 

00:11:10
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah. 

00:11:15
SIMON RICH And the way your work and, cuz that's, that's, a more challenging relationship to have with one's clients than the kind, simply mirroring or at being emotionally at arm's length. Let's just, before we get into that, there's this basic distinction that's made in EFT between primary and secondary emotion. That seems helpful and, I think, will also help people follow as we move more into the style of EFT and the way in which you employ it in, in the actual psychotherapy. So what's the difference between primary and secondary emotion? 

00:11:55
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah, that's great. Primary emotions are the softer feelings that have our vulnerabilities embedded in them. Those softer feelings are closest to the heart of the matter, that's why we call them primary. There're essentially, you know, essentially six universal emotions based on universal facial expressions, knowing that the meaning of those facial expressions are socially or culturally constructed. But those primary emotions, we really want to access and work to because when they're expressed they pulled the loved one in rather than the secondary emotion that push the loved one away. Secondary affect in EFT, we view that as the faster moving emotion. It's reactive in nature, it's protective. It's often defensive in a protective, not, not pathologizing it by calling it defensive, but in that it serves to protect the tender, more primary emotions. So, often in distressed couples it's not safe enough to be vulnerable. It's not safe enough to share the primary soft emotions, or maybe as a person I'm uncomfortable feeling those tender vulnerabilities that all humans have regardless of rank, or grade, or status, or gender. And I will, again in a distressed relationship, go to the protective, secondary emotion that is safer to express when I'm not sure if my partner is really with me or not. 

00:13:15
SIMON RICH So, with all due respect to Rick Perry, can you tell us the six primary emotions? 

00:13:25
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah, and I should correct myself a little bit because some of these six primary emotions can be expressed as secondary. So I don't' want to say there're only six primary and that they're only primary. But the six core emotions that an EFT therapist is centrally focused on is anger, fear, sadness, shame and disgust being , you know, related, surprise/excitement being connected, and joy. And we talk about these six core emotions being universal in that they're communicated in the micro-movements of the facial expression. They communicate very quickly to our loved ones, more quickly that the prefrontal cortex can come in and shut them down. And in each of these core emotions, there's an action tendency though, so the action tendency of anger, of course, is to assert ourselves, or to mobilize. We can defend with our anger. The action tendency for sadness, for instance, is to turn towards your loved one or turn away from your loved one. These action tendencies are vital to understanding the protest we see in distressed couples. You know, we'll see couples come in with emotional intensity and lots of anger, and it's really feisty and fiery. When you understand anger as a threat to their attachment bond, when you think of anger as a protest to the lack of connection with an important other, that anger makes perfect sense and, in fact, you know, we can work with it. Even though it's strong and intense, you know, it's really, you know, primary anger really tells us about what we need and it helps us assert ourselves, and it helps us feel entitled to our experience. And, so those six emotions and their action tendencies are really important to understand attachment behaviors, what humans do when they can't get secure connection with the one who matters most. As I say with my clients, "We all do funny things." 

00:15:15
SIMON RICH Okay, yeah. 

00:15:20
KATHRYN RHEEM We turn up the emotional heat in a way that's super intense, maybe over the top. But the more I need connection and the less it's coming the more I'm gonna turn up the heat, whereas others turn down the emotional heat as a way to help regulate themselves. 

00:15:35
SIMON RICH Okay. So let's, let, one of the things I know that Sue Johnson talks about is all this, the subtle ways in which therapists, even when they, they think they're dealing with emotion in a session, have a way of compartmentalizing it, dealing exclusively with the cognitive element, steer away from, sort of, the messiness of, of emotion and, and certainly that unpredictability factor and emotion. 

00:16:00
KATHRYN RHEEM Right. 

00:16:05
SIMON RICH So let's, let's get really concrete here. 

00:16:05
KATHRYN RHEEM Sure. 

00:16:05
SIMON RICH And let's talk about, as we have in many of these sessions, about, so much of, particularly in couples therapy, I think this is true in any, any kind of psychotherapy. Particularly in couples therapy, so much of what becomes possible within the therapy is established very early on in that first session. So, first session, and perhaps you've had a couple recently that springs to mind or however we can do this, can you give us a flavor as a, as a, someone who is very focused on these, the expression of emotion, the acknowledgement of emotion, the sharing of emotion within couples. The couples come in, it's the first session, what is it that you're, what's your role here aside from these theoretical principles that you described so nicely here? What are you doing to create an environment in which people can feel emotion, where it's safe to be emotionally expressive and entertain their, their own vulnerability, expose their vulnerability? 

00:17:05
KATHRYN RHEEM My overarching goal primarily is to help them know that their emotions make sense. Even though they're incredibly uncomfortable, perhaps very intense, perhaps they've been dismissed by everybody else, but that their emotions make sense and that part of my job in building an alliance and creating safety for them is to encourage that emotional exploration. I want to help slow them down so that they can feel all that's happening on the inside for them in a safe way, in a self-, in a process of discovery. I'm going to come alongside them, gonna help them make sense of their emotion by reflecting elements of it back for them, by tuning in and feeling a little bit about, of what they might be feeling, holding it up for them to see, and really aligning with their felt sense, their intra-psychic experience. What, what's happening on the inside for them? Because we know it's strong emotion that fuels our behaviors, those with those action tendencies that I just talked about. And so, it's those strong emotions that fuel the action tendencies and primes the action that we want to slow down and work with because that's- 

00:18:10
SIMON RICH So, speaking of slowing down. 

00:18:10
KATHRYN RHEEM Yes. 

00:18:15
SIMON RICH So give us a flavor for how this works. So, so what's the "how" of that? Cuz it may be lots of therapists may think that that's what they're doing. But what is it, you know, just, sort of in a very concrete and particular way. A couples comes in, and if there's a, if a, if there's a particular session that comes to mind that you can guide use through, just, if we were a fly on the wall in a session and just watching the process and what you say, and don't say, and when you say it, and what you're trying to accomplish in the beginning of that session? But if you could- 

00:18:45
KATHRYN RHEEM Sure. 

00:18:45
SIMON RICH Describe that for us. 

00:18:45
KATHRYN RHEEM Sure. So let's take a classic pursue-withdraw. So female pursuer, male withdrawer. Doesn't mean that it can't happen in same sex relationships, but just for the sake of example. And working a lot with military couples coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan, and so, often, let's say the service member is the male. And so, often the male will come in reluctantly. I've had many of these soldiers and marines say they prefer to be in Iraq or Afghanistan. They feel more comfortable there, they're safer there than in the therapy room. That makes perfect sense. "Coming to therapy is," I'll say to them, "is a little bit like landing on a foreign planet, a different planet, learning a foreign language." 

00:19:30
SIMON RICH Yeah. 

00:19:30
KATHRYN RHEEM And, my goal is not to get them to emote. It's not about weeping or crying. I want to be really clear with them upfront. My goal is to help them access a different place from the inside, access a different place within so they can get to know their partner and their partner can get to know them. 

00:19:50
SIMON RICH So, so the way, so what's actually happening? So are you at the beginning, do you begin with an introduction about that? What are actually taking place in the room? 

00:20:00
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah, I'll say, "I'd like to hear from each of you about your felt sense of your relationship at this point." And, and you'll hear my emphasis on “felt sense" because I'm priming the pump. I want them to get acclimated to my types of questions. I've been told by couples who've had previous couple therapy that my questions are different, they're unique. And I'm redirecting them to their inner world, and then I'm connecting their inner world to their relationship pattern. And so, to this kind of guy I might say, “On the inside, it's like there's nothing. There's a blankness, there's a tabula rasa, clean slate." Or, “There's a floor that you just don't go below." Instead of a glass ceiling it's like a glass floor. You know there's stuff down there but you just don't penetrate that, that floor. And he might say, "Yeah, exactly. Why would I go there? I just end up feeling miserable. I don't wanna feel miserable, I can't afford to feel miserable." And, and I say, "Right, I understand feeling miserable is incredibly uncomfortable. And yet, not being able to access these other parts of yourself, you know, means that we're, your relationship is missing these vital elements. Your relationship is missing these parts of yourself." And I'll say that to the female as well. This is not about starting with the male and pinning on the man at all. It's for both partners, helping them understand that we, this process will be about helping them access what I call "the underbelly", the softer side which is the softer emotions that connect us all, emotion being the glue of love, these softer emotions being the glue that bonds us. So- 

00:21:40
SIMON RICH So, okay. So, you, so, you ask this question and, and, and when you use this expression "felt sense", that you're, that seems that you're, people seem to be able to, they respond to that and, and are able to identify that? 

00:21:55
KATHRYN RHEEM Maybe not- 

00:22:00
SIMON RICH Where does it, where does it go once you're, what's, sort of, give us an idea of, if that's your opening question to the couple, give us a sense of, kind of, a couple of different ways with people that really get with the program. 

00:22:15
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah. 

00:22:15
SIMON RICH Imagine it's one thing, and then not everyone is going to get with, really get that immediately. So maybe you can give us a flavor for what happens, the experience moment to moment in both those kinds of cases? 

00:22:30
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah, so I'll ask each partner for their felt sense of their relationship at this point. And, I use "felt sense" and other words like “touch." "How are you touched? What do you long for?" I used attachment based words, or word that evoke attachment on purpose, also, to steer clients away from the cognition into more of their effective, affective experience. And so, I'll say, you know, I'll turn to each partner and say, “I'd like to hear from each of you about your felt sense of your relationship at this point, your felt experience." And then I'll, as I hear from each of them, I'll do what I can to connect it to their relationship's pattern. So, if I were a fly on the wall and you're having this kind of discussion, disagreement, upset fight, argument at home, what would I see? You have this felt sense on the inside and when this felt sense comes up and these arguments at home, what do you do with it? What's the behavior? What's the action tendency? Who might leave the room? Who throws up their hand exasperated? Who's the first one to raise their voice? Who might, you know, threaten to end the relationship? Who goes for a walk? Who checks their email? So, I want to get a sense of their felt experience and how that felt experience is expressed in these, you know, these distressing moments when, when they're caught, you know, all couples get caught in. 

00:23:45
SIMON RICH Okay. So, some folks are able to do that, and they understand that language, and they're willing to take that step and take whatever, how they experience the risk of doing that. And, I imagine there's some bunch of folks who might say, "What are you talking about our felt sense?" 

00:24:00
KATHRYN RHEEM Yup. 

00:24:05
SIMON RICH Well, you tell me. What, what happens with, with people who have difficult, initial difficulty with that? 

00:24:10
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah, we, there are many who have initial difficulty with that. It's, it's uncomfortable to be asked about parts of ourselves that we're really not in touch with or parts of ourselves that have never been valued. I realize that I'm asking difficult questions. When, when a client expresses difficulty with it I'll instantly say, "Let me change my question." I really, you know, my overarching goal is to set the client up for success. I really don't want to ask them something- 

00:24:35
SIMON RICH Good. 

00:24:40
KATHRYN RHEEM They can't answer. Although, that's coupled with the fine line of, I really want to start directing them to their internal world. I really want them to start acclimating to my process, what I do with couples, so that we can see if we're a good fit. So that, you know, we can make sure that, you know, I don't do the first session in one way and then they come in for the second and third sessions and I'm very different. And so, many couples will struggle with the words and they'll say, "Kathryn, I'm not sure what you mean. Can you help me? Felt sense?" And I'll say, "Yeah. You know, you know, some of us get a physiological sensation. So, in your body, what you're going through, do you feel a sense of tightness or tension?" So that's often, especially for service members, especially for men. Women too, of course, but going through the body arousal is a really good doorway into their emotional life in terms of tightness in their chest, nauseousness, sweaty palms, hair on my neck raises, tightness across my forehead, lots of physiological arousal and symptoms or sensations. And so, I'll find different ways to slice my question thinner to stay closer to their experience. I know it, you know, I'll say, "I know my questions are a little strange. I've been told that before and I really appreciate you hanging in with me. I'm looking for a certain kind of data and maybe it's different data than you expected me to be curious about, or it's different than your other type of couples therapy. And so, I'm looking for data that helps me help you guys connect. I'm looking for data that's all about act attachment, and I'll explain that if needed. Attachment or affect, that's what I'm going for." And, you know, but I'll go slow and I'll, you know, we'll listen to the narrative of what brought them in and try to connect that with their felt sense, and the emotion. And they'll, they, you know, I've been told that clients feel my emphasis on the emotion. And then I'll say, "What's that like for you?" At the end of the first session I'll say, "You probably noticed my emphasis on your felt experience and on the emotion, and I wondered what that's like for you? Do you, do you need rationale for why I'm focused there?" And I'm happy to provide it. So, I try to make the process as overt and as transparent and as predictable as possible. But I want to be. You know, the essence of EFT is focus. You know, I want to be, I want to be fair to the client that this is where I'm gonna head and, you know, you can opt-in or opt-out. 

00:27:05
SIMON RICH So, okay. So, why don't you, what is, is your first session, how long is a typical first session? 

00:27:10
KATHRYN RHEEM Fifty minutes. 

00:27:15
SIMON RICH Fifty, okay. So, that's fifty minutes. So, at, at the point at which, so in terms of what, what's getting established in that first session. So you, you're, you're talking directly to each partner in the relationship, you're asking them questions. And, what is it by the end of that first session, what is it that you're hoping has happened? What is, what is it that you, you would like, as the therapist, would like to accomplish? 

00:27:45
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah. From my perspective, I'm hoping I have a working hypothesis of their interactional pattern. That's step two of EFT, that I have a sense of what their relationship looks like in its distressing moments in terms of who does what when, and fueled by what feeling on the inside? That's just a very, on the surface, experience. There's, you know, it's not enough, enough emotional depth. I'm not going to emotional depth, I'm not going to evoke vulnerabilities in a first session. I obviously need to establish more alliance and help the client feel safer before I do that. But, I want to have a skeleton, a frame of a working hypothesis of this couple's interactional pattern, and a little bit about the strong emotions either one of them might be feeling that fuels, you know, in this case that we were talking about, the woman's pursuit. You know, the, the fears that fuel her anxiety and push her to turn up the emotional heat just when he needs a moment to relax. And what happens for her inside when she's peppering him with questions? And what is her softer feeling? What is the underbelly for her part of it that she's not saying? That would be a lot more tolerable for him to hear. He could be responsive if he heard how much he/she missed him rather than hearing all her questions that come with an edge I her voice, or laced with slight criticism that he hasn't measured up, he hasn't answered well, he hasn't completed the task, whatever it might be. So, that's from the therapist's perspective. For the client, we hope, you know, I hope that they feel a sense of safety and that I get them. I'm starting to get them, that what I'm providing for them is relevant. Task relevance in EFT is, is important in terms of successful outcomes. I want them to feel that my emphasis is relevant to them personally, individually as well as to their relationship. And so, I really want to help them, I have to stay attuned and it's, you know, it's interesting to start attuning to people you've never met before. But that's task, is to stay at empathetically attuned as I come to know this couple so that they feel that my joining with them and my interventions are relevant to their relationship and their individual needs. 

00:29:55
SIMON RICH So, by the end of a, how much you end that first session, is there something that you typically might say at the end of a first session? Is there, is there a certain kind of task or focus? Where, where does it get left if I'm watching you at the end of the first session? Let's focus for you, for a moment, about what is it that you're, you're doing. What you're, what're you saying? 

00:30:15
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah. So at the, towards the end of the first session, I'll start going up in altitude to a more global level, level, to get a more meta perspective. 

00:30:25
SIMON RICH Yeah, okay. 

00:30:25
KATHRYN RHEEM Start climbing the mountain, so to speak, to start containing whatever was stirred up in this session, and as well as to start encapsulating. I want to leave the clients with a sense of structure. So, as we know, ther-, therapy stirs things up and, you know, I think there's value in, in people and all us being stirred up. But I don't, ideally, I don't want them to walk out feeling stirred up. I want them to feel in touch with themselves, but not overwhelmed with their emotional experience. And so, that's why we don't evoke right off, right off the bat. That's why we don't put our foot on the gas in, in stage one of EFT around all, everyone's vulnerabilities, each partner's vulnerabilities. We don't want to flood the client with their own chaotic emotion until we can help provide some structure, organization for that emotion. 

00:31:15
SIMON RICH And in doing that, so, what are the kinds of things, what is it that you're saying? What are we, so that, that's, that's clear, that's, that's your goal. So what is it that you're doing and saying in the service- 

00:31:25
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah. 

00:31:25
SIMON RICH Of that as being your goal? 

00:31:30
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah. I'll start, if one partner is talking about their intra-psychic experience, I'll start connecting it to the relationship cycle as a way to start moving them out of their deeper emotional experience and into their interactional pattern. So, as you know, in EFT we're constantly linking the self and the system. I'll start focusing on more on the system to provide the container, that attachment frame on their relationship distress as a container for these really strong emotions that aren't gonna get regulated, aren't going to get processed in one session, or certainly at the end of a first session. And so, I'll focus more on the system and their strengths as a couple, and offer reassurance. If I genuinely feel hope I'll, I'll share that with them and I'll be as concrete as I can be about what makes me hopeful and the strengths I see between them. If nothing else, the strength that they came for therapy at this point. I'll let them know that I appreciated their honest and their transparency. It takes courage to open up to a stranger like me. And then I'll ask them, “How was this for you? How are you doing as we wrap up here?" "I wanna know", I'll literally say, "a word or a phrase" that can be longer, of course, but if nothing else, “a word or a phrase that helps me know how you're doing as we get ready to say goodbye?" And, so that gives them a chance to, one, the question helps them organize their inner world just with a question itself. What is a word or a phrase? And in order to pull a word or a phrase out, you, they're gonna do, be doing some processing internally. And it's not asking, hopefully it's not asking too much of them, but it's enough to say, “I want to know how you're doing. I care about how you're doing and I wanna leave you in the best possible place I can, given that, you know, we have some work ahead of us." 

00:33:20
SIMON RICH So now, how much feedback are you giving about what you're seeing? Do you, by the end of the session are you, are you giving them a view of what you see going on in the relationship? Is that, do you see that, consider that to be an important thing to do at the end of a first session? 

00:33:40
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah, as clear as I have it I'll reflect it for them, and I'll ask how my reflection feels to them. Do I, do they, do I feel, is, is, my reflection accurate? Is my empathy accurate? Of course, we always want them to correct us and there's no sense in having a therapist going full steam ahead with inaccuracies. And so, I'll reflect my understanding of their relationship's distress and their relationship's pattern, you know, to my understanding at that point. And I'll says it in a soft and slow way, which is- 

00:34:10
SIMON RICH So, if you could, for a moment just, just, this, this is great, and just, how might it sound? 

00:34:10
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah. 

00:34:10
SIMON RICH Like, can you think of a recent session and- 

00:34:10
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah. 

00:34:15
SIMON RICH So I'm, here I am. I'm, I'm the, the, your guy here. And you're just telling me, and I'm sitting here, and I'm a bit on edge, and my wife has dragged me into couples therapy, and you've asked me about my felt sense and all kinds of things that I'm not used to talking about. And at the end of it, I'm not quite sure what's happened here, and if you were to, just to, leave, leave, what would you leave me with? How might you address me at the end of that first session? 

00:34:45
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah. I would say, "Well, as we get ready to say goodbye, I just want to reflect, Rich, how honored I am that you shared with me parts of your world, maybe parts of your inner world, that maybe feel a bit distant or a bit unfamiliar. Maybe things you don't really share with people, or many people, and you've really followed my lead when I asked these kinds of strange questions. I'm working here to collect datas that I can use to work on your behalf, to work on your relationship's behalf. And I really appreciate how honest you were with me and how forthcoming and transparent. So, as I'm seeing you experience and, and what you've reported as, as discomfort and tension, I'm seeing how important your wife is to you. I'm seeing how important a connection with your wife is. I think I'm also hearing how important it is you feel like you're enough for her. That she reflects for you that you're enough just as you are. And so, any sense of failure or inadequacy, you know, those are your words from earlier, any sense of that, I want to help your wife share her experience with you so that you know that you're enough. That there's space in this relationship for you to be fully yourself, and I look forward to working together to help you with that." 

00:36:00
SIMON RICH Okay. So, alright. So we're coming to the end, and is there something that you ask couples to do with the end of that, sort of, a first session? What's your, what is your understanding, either explicit or implicit, about what's the contract for the couple's work? 

00:36:20
KATHRYN RHEEM Well, what I do ask them to do is be gentle with themselves and each other. And, again, using, using words like “felt sense" and "how does this touch you on the inside" and "how does this move you, what do you long for?" I use the word gentle on purpose, and it seems funny to use that with military service members, and I take the risk of being corny. You know, I don't often use, you know, when I work with certain populations, I don't use the feeling words. Sometimes I think of it as the other f-word. And so, I will, you know, I don't want to make people more uncomfortable by constantly focusing on feelings, but I'll say, "Be gentle. This, this was a big step and I really appreciate the privilege of walking alongside you both in your relationship." And there's no real task in EFT. If they ask for a task, or they want something to do, I'll say, you know, "The reflection of my working hypothesis of your", you know, "your relationship's pattern, see if that sits, see how that sits with you, notice how that sits with you over the course of the week. Notice if it comes up for you in key moments, or notice it if it comes up when you're talking about those same issues that always drag you guys apart and disconnect you." And so, I ask them just to notice. In early stage one of EFT, we don't want to ask them to do more than that because, really, we want to get their focus internal to their feelings, to their affect, to their attachment needs, fears, or longings. And we know that that's a paradigm shift. We know that we're asking, that's a, that's a huge task for many of us, most of us, whether we're men or women, military or not. That's a huge task to slow down and say, “Wait, how is this sitting with me? How, how does Kathryn's frame on our distress, does that really fit for me?" So, I ask them to consider that. And then in the second session, which is often each, each partner in EFT has an individual session in the second. So the second and third sessions in EFT are individual sessions. I'll ask, "How was the first session for you? What was it like during the session- 

00:38:25
SIMON RICH Without the other partner being present? 

00:38:30
KATHRYN RHEEM Right. What was that first- 

00:38:30
SIMON RICH So, what's the thinking about, about that? What's the, the idea? 

00:38:30
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah- 

00:38:35
SIMON RICH So there's conjoined session, and then the next time you meet with them, you meet with them separately? 

00:38:40
KATHRYN RHEEM (crosstalk) Individually. 

00:38:40
SIMON RICH I may schedule them at separate, do they come together or do you schedule it at separate times? 

00:38:45
KATHRYN RHEEM Either way. Sometimes they have back to back individual appointment, and so they come together and- 

00:38:50
SIMON RICH The full, it's a full hour's time with each of them individually? 

00:38:55
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah. 

00:38:55
SIMON RICH Okay. 

00:38:55
KATHRYN RHEEM And it's to build the alliance, certainly, and as well as to assess for any contraindications for EFT or couple therapy. Those hot button issues, affairs, addictions, abuse, that we all want to be aware of and cognizant of and, you know, we certainly don't want to be evoking those hot button issues if there's not enough safety and there's a risk of that happening, you know, say abuse happening at home. So, we want to learn more about that in the individual sessions as well as focus on each partner's attachment history, and that's another focus of the individual sessions. So we, you know, as part of building alliance, as I work on your behalf and I help your partner be more responsive, and I help you share in a way that pulls your partner close, I wanna know what you've gone through. I wanna know what your inner world is like. But, you know, as, I'm their temporary attachment figure. I'm safer than their partner is in a distressed relationship. I'm certainly a stranger, but in that distance and in the being a stranger, there's a, there's a modicum of safety. They don't have to worry about my love and acceptance. They're not fighting for connection with me. So, as I build an alliance with them I, you know, I literally say, “I look forward to working on your behalf and", you know," in your experience, how, what, how can I best work on your behalf? What happens when you try to share these important elements of your experience with your partner?" 

00:40:20
SIMON RICH Alright. So, that's, so, it's, you've, you've had an initial couple's session, you've had individual session, you've gotten some history, you have a sense of attachment history, you have a sense of are there landmines along the way that, perhaps, you shouldn't, you would best be informed about? What, so when they come back for that, the next couple's session, what's your mindset there? What is it you're, you're, what is it you're trying to accomplish at that point? Or what's, is there a particular structure for that- 

00:40:55
KATHRYN RHEEM Yup. 

00:40:55
SIMON RICH Second couple's session? 

00:41:00
KATHRYN RHEEM Well, there's not a particular structure for the second couple's session, but, as you know, there's that really great delineated model of EFT that I'm constantly leaning on. So, I know, obviously, we're in stage one of EFT. I know the goal of stage one is de-escalation. How I help couples deescalate is to help them understand their distress from attachment perspective. But that more important they are to each other, the more their attachment protests will be off the charts. And that can be in terms of emotional intensity or silencing the emotion. And that, you know, sometimes I'll say to a woman who is yelling a lot and raises voice that, "It sounds to me the more you raise your voice, it tells me that that's, that that correlates with the degree of importance your partner is to you. And so, if he wasn't, or she wasn't, if your partner wasn't important to you, you wouldn't need to yell. But the yelling is your way of saying protesting the lack of connection, saying ‘I need you, I miss you. You have to hear me, I'm feeling so alone right now. I can't bear to feel this alone.’" So the start of the couple's session after the individual sessions is really steps two, three, and four of EFT, which is articulating and delineating their interactional pattern and filling that out. And step three is the intra-psychic step of stage one of EFT. So really, what is that strong emotion that grips each partner and fuels their steps in the dance? You know, the emotion is the music of the couple's dance, and that emotion moves us all in certain ways and I want to help each partner. I want to learn from each partner, what is moving inside of them? And how does it either pull their partner close to them or push their partner away? So, usually step three in EFT is about fears, needs, and longings, all about the attachment bond and the security of the bond, and the importance of their loved one. And so, I'll start, that's, you know, I really, really jump into steps two and three and use my, you know, I want a certain level of experientialness(ph). You know, EFT is experiential. We start off with experiences right from the beginning in terms of enactments and having partners turn to each other with clear signals about new or emerging emotion, or about places where they've been really stuck. And so- 

00:43:15
SIMON RICH Just (inaudible [00:43;19]) for a second. So, as early, up to this point in that first session, you made a point earlier, you're not, you don't want to go there. There is no lot of intense emotion expressed in the session. So what, this is the, so at, at this point and in these individual sessions is you're getting background information, you're couple's not together so they're not triggering each other. But as early as the second session, then people can begin to have rather intense experiences in, in these sessions. 

00:43:50
KATHRYN RHEEM Yes. 

00:43:55
SIMON RICH And, I mean, if so, describe, and maybe if you can particularize this a bit for us, give us a flavor of how things might emerge pretty early on in your process? 

00:44:05
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah, and so, it's, a point in clarity, Rich, they'll come in the first session with a lot of emotional intensity. I just won't evoke their vulnerabilities just because I don't know about any contraindications of their relationship. I don't know about the degree of safety that they feel or don't feel. So, I won't evoke their deep needs, fears, and longings in an emotional way. So then in the second joint session, I will, you know, they'll still probably have the, the same degree of emotional intensity they had in the first session. You know, as we know, couples wait too long to come for therapy. So there's a lot bottled up, there's a lot stored up, and, you know, those emotions drive us. Even when we don't want them, they lead us by the nose. And so, in that second joint session, I do have a felt sense of their experience more, more so because I've had the individual sessions with them. I feel like I'm better able to work on each partner's behalf and on their relationship's behalf. I'll say to them that, "Your relationship is my client. And so, I", you know, "clearly don't take sides. I'm not interested in who's at fault or who is to blame at all, it's so counterproductive. But as I work on your relationship's behalf, I want to hear more from each of you about what happens when you feel these strong feelings that you named in the first session." Or, if they didn't name ‘em in the first session, I'll say, you know, "When you're leaving the room, throwing up your hands and slamming the door behind you, you're feeling what on the inside? Help me know what's happening on the inside of you. It sounds like a, like overwhelm, it sounds like intensity, It sounds like, I don't know if chaos fits. Sounds like you feel not heard or understood, maybe you're very frustrated. Tell me what you know about what's happening for you in those moments." 

00:45:55
SIMON RICH Okay. And so, you're saying earlier about, you used this term "evoking". 

00:45:55
KATHRYN RHEEM Yes. 

00:46:00
SIMON RICH And so, in terms of, we're making a contrast when we began this about a more cognitive way of working with people where you don't have them experienced with all the sense of immediate urgency and body response, and get into emotion in the consulting room. So, can you help us understand in the second session how that under, how might that happen? And, and, and, if you can, if you can recall a case, perhaps a recent one, which something, a particular thing happened and just to give us the flavor of how this, how, what it's like to be an EF-, to be you? To be and EFT therapist and the kinds of things that you do at, and to both evoke and to help people work with their emotion in the way that's gonna be ultimately useful for them? 

00:46:55
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah. So, in EFT, as we already discussed, the EFT therapist wants to contain the secondary emotion, and how we contain that emotion is really validate its function. That secondary emotion has served tremendous function for each partner through the course of their relationship of, you know, perhaps through the course of their lifespans. And so, we really validate the secondary emotion and we really want to join with them in it despite its intensity and how uncomfortable it is, and how raw it might feel. And as we validate the secondary, we're working closer. We're walking with the client closer and closer to the primary emotion. And so, and so while we're not evoking the deep vulnerabilities in the first session, with a little bit more background for each partner and a little bit more of an alliance, we're doing all that we can to create a, a safe place for each partner to explore what happens on the inside for them. And so, a man recently said to me, "You know, Kathryn, you just need to know we come from different cultures." And I said, "Oh, interesting. Help me understand this coming from different cultures." You know, to the eye they don't look like they're all that different. And so, I was curious, like, "Oh, different cultures. Help me understand." And he said- 

00:48:10
SIMON RICH And the we, Kathryn, was, just so I understand, you and him or he and his wife? 

00:48:20
KATHRYN RHEEM He and his wife come from different cultures, and he was letting me know that that was the reason for their distress. 

00:48:25
SIMON RICH I see, okay. 

00:48:25
KATHRYN RHEEM yes. Even though, to my eye I would not have necessarily from a cultural or ethnic background standpoint, and I know that's a limited view of culture, they didn't look different to me. But I was really curious. 

00:48:35
SIMON RICH (inaudible ) 

00:48:40
KATHRYN RHEEM Right. So, I said, "Help me understand. When you say you, you and your wife come from different cultural backgrounds, tell me, tell me what, what you mean and help me understand that for you." And he said, “You know, she's a New England, puritan, individual, rugged individualist and I'm a laid back Californian. And our worlds have collided since day one and it seemed like opposites attract, and we got married. We, we thought we could really balance each other, and now, 18 years later, we're so far from balancing each other. We're in fact pushing each other's buttons and our differences seem to come between us." And so, I say, "So, on the inside for you when these differences come between you…" So I could go into the content and talk about all the differences, and how New England is so different from Southern California, but for, from and EFT perspective, we don't really want to emphasize that. I want to know and I want to focus on this felt sense. So he talk to me, husband, about "the differences that come between you and your wife. Tell me what it's like for you. What are you going through on the inside when you notice these differences come between you? Is there an image? Is it like a block that you're chipping away at? Is there a metaphor for these differences?" It's, you know, "We're on different planets. We're speaking different languages." And so, I'll really want to explore what he's in touch with, what his experience is like from a very much an open, curious place to encourage his exploration of it. Sometimes, in a second session, that's very helpful for the partner. They've had no idea that their partner feels what they feel or has made the meaning that they've made. Other times it's, it's really from my joining with him and for, for my coming alongside him and linking arms with him, metaphorically linking arms with him, so that I get a sense of what his world looks like from where he stands. I want to, I want to know what his landscape looks like, you know, from, from standing in his shoes. 

00:50:45
SIMON RICH Okay. So, as, as, as you're doing that, now, what role, if any, does the, we've been describing so far is you're talking to each of the partners and you're helping them to formulate in words their inner experience and really encouraging them to express it, put into language. So, where's the, what role and under what circumstances are you doing enactments and you're having them talk with each other. Which the more, as we all know, a lot more trigger points in that- 

00:51:15
KATHRYN RHEEM Yes. 

00:51:15
SIMON RICH Kind of interaction, and if, if they're both, they're relating to us. 

00:51:20
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah. So when couples are caught and our partner is caught in secondary affect, we have them process that with us. We don't enact secondary emotion. That's just too explosive and often fuels the fire, and- 

00:51:35
SIMON RICH And secondary emotion, just remind us. Give us some words for that for people. 

00:51:35
KATHRYN RHEEM Secondary are the hard emotions that are reactive in nature and they push the loved one away. They, you know, they create space protective in function, but they move very quickly. And so, that's often what couples, what catches couples in a fight, or what creates the escalation is secondary battling heads with secondary. And so, in EFT in the first second, you know, right off the bat, we're gonna contain the secondary and say, "Tell me about that. I wanna know what you're going through." So, I, that person processes their secondary with me as I help them, plant seeds, and I slowly word drop a little seeds in there about something more primary to see if they'll take my, take my addition to their experience. What conjecture- 

00:52:20
SIMON RICH So, tell us how that might sound. Again, if you're helping me with my secondary emotion here so I'm getting, getting angry or whatever it is. Whatever I am. 

00:52:30
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah. 

00:52:30
SIMON RICH And, how might you, you help me? How might you help me understand, deal with that secondary emotion in a somewhat different way? 

00:52:40
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah. So, especially in stage one of EFT, I would tell you how much sense your anger makes and, you know, I would wanna say, "Help me know, Rich. This anger is code for ‘you miss your wife? You miss feeling successful with your wife? You are desperate to know that you're enough in her eyes?’ Anger is your desperation of needing to know that you have a place in her heart? Is that fitting for you? And am I on target with some of that?" And so, I'm, I'm validating his anger and then I'm adding the soft, one of, you know, a softer element. It could be anything, but of course I'm focused on attachment. So, missing your wife, feeling like an outsider, not having a place in her heart, needing to know you're enough for her, that you're successful in her eyes. It's like this anger is your way of saying to your wife, "I can't bear not feeling successful with you." And, and if that doesn't fit, then he'll, and I'll say, “So, are this, is my metaphor fitting for you? Are my words fitting for you? Is it about not feeling successful in her eyes?" And he'll either say yes or no, and if it's no then I'll say, "Tell me." You know, "What, what is it for you? What is it that you're really needing to feel from your wife?" And do the same thing for her. You know, if she's a pursuer, the classic pursuer is feeling unimportant, their needs aren't mattering, feeling tenth on the priority list of their partner, and that attachment protest, which is also often anger but anger can be primary too, but that secondary anger needs to be validated as we wrap it into the couple's interactional patter and add in the softer feelings. And we don't go from anger to lonely, anger to grief, anger to sadness. We walk the client down from secondary to primary. And so, sometimes clients will say, "I'm frustrated." Then I'll say with frustrated, "Frustrated, of course that makes sense, like you're annoyed. Very annoyed." And, and then they might add "irritated." “It's so irritating. I'm so tired of this." And I'll say, "Right, tired. Maybe even exhausted, or is it draining too?" "Yes, it is draining. I'm really tired of this drain, like enough already. It's been twelve years of this." “Right, enough already. Almost like there's this need for something else, this drain needs to be plugged. You know, we need to stop the draining. It's like you're saying I'm bleeding over here and you're not knowing, you're not noticing that I'm bleeding. I need some care." "Right, I need some care." So, we're, that's, you know, we, that's a far way to go. I wouldn't go there all in one session, but we're progressively walking them closer to primary by staying so close to their felt sense. And using our muscle of empathy and using our attunement, our abilities to stay attuned to them, to join with them. 

00:55:35
SIMON RICH And so, in, and in that process, so at the point where you're, someone is receptive to this, you're attuned. You're getting into primary emotion territory. How do you make a, seems like a fundamental decision then, a real turning point in the therapy is when to begin to get the couple deal with each other? 

00:56:00
KATHRYN RHEEM Yes, and sorry I keep forgetting to answer you primary question with the enactments. So, the enactments are used to help partners make safe contact with each other. So, they always turn to each other but it's, you know, it's escalated, it's edgy, it's explosive, it's, it's, you know, they're not making safe contact with each other. So, when we ask for an enactment, it's very purposeful with very intentional that we want new or emerging emotion to be what is enacted. Or, in some case, a stuck place, which would sound, "Part of me wants to open up to you. Part of me wants to open up to this process, but another part of me is so drained that I'm not sure I can." And so, we would have an enactment around these different parts, which is different than the rigid stance of, "I'm drained, and you're not doing it right. And I'm shut down and I'm closed off." So, enactments are, you know, we really want them to be safe moments of contact about new or emerging emotion. Sometimes in the early stage of EFT can be about appreciation and sharing appreciation. Which, again, in distressed relationships, appreciation isn't shared. And so, we could say, "Did you, were you able to, you know, you told me how appreciative you were of your partner bringing you coffee in bed and, and I wonder if your partner knew that. Were you able to say that to him or her?" And it's like, "No, I think he just knew it because I smiled." "Uh-huh." But so, in EFT we're making the implicit experience explicit because all of this emotional processing happens incredibly fast and it's all implicit except that it seeps out of every pore, right? So, the process is implicit except it changes our facial expression in a nanosecond, and it's seeping from our pores, and it scrambles the signals between us. So what we're doing in EFT is, so when you smiled because he brought you the coffee, on the inside you're saying, "Oh, that felt good. That felt, I feel heard, I feel seen, I feel valued." And you see if any of those stick for this safe woman, for instance, and then, you know, you say, "Were you able to share that with your partner? Were you able to share how nice it was? It was such a sweet moment for you to think of me and bring me coffee." "Well no, I didn't really share it. We don't really talk about that. We don't talk that way to each other." “Uh-huh, right. Well what would it be like now to turn to your partner and say that was really sweet, I felt really touched by you bringing me coffee?" And so, for a couple that doesn't, quote, “talk that way", now with your help, enactments are really small, especially in the early parts of EFT in stage one. Simple, sweet, small, and, you know, putting some new part of their experience in their hand and holding it out for their partner to see, a reach. And so, you know, then for couples who quote, "don't talk that way", suddenly they're talking that way and being very successful at it. 

00:59:05
SIMON RICH Okay, so, I'm getting this, a flavor as, as a, of, of this, kind of, this basic process that we're talking about and my understanding of EFT. We've been talking, we're about to move from this phase one into phase two, which is really, again my understanding, the meat and potatoes- 

00:59:20
KATHRYN RHEEM Yes. 

00:59:25
SIMON RICH Of EFT. Tell me about, what, what goes on. We don't have that much time, but- 

00:59:25
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah. 

00:59:25
SIMON RICH Can you give us a flavor for this, this, this phase two? 

00:59:30
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah. So, stage two is the heart of the matter for, for EFT, where our whole point is to help couples create a new way of interacting. So we've contained and deescalated their old pattern of interaction that quote, "negative pattern". And through stage two of EFT, as you say the "meat and potatoes" which is great. The meat of the matter, the heart of the matter, is we're really helping couples talk in re-, repeated ways, I guess is what I wanna say. We need to help them talk about their vulnerabilities, their fears, needs, and longings. And, again and again, so this new way of interaction becomes predictable, becomes stable, becomes trustworthy. Initially, couples don't trust it because it's so foreign, it's unsettling even, to hear your partner talk about their fears or their needs, or something they've always longed for, when you've been pretzeling(ph) yourself to meet their needs. And you've twisted and turned, and you've thought, “If only I could do it this way. My partner should feel loved and held by me." And, and it's been so distressing that they haven't. In stage two, when each partner can talk about what they long for and the fears that have come up for them when their longings weren't met, we're really helping partners be responsive to each other. Emotionally accessible and responsive is the heart of stage two. It's in the sharing that their accessible, vulner-, vulnerable, emotionally accessible, and in the responsiveness for the listening partner, that they're listening from a place of vulnerability, and a place of empathy, and a place of attunement rather than, as is common in stage one, a place of defensiveness or protecting ourselves. And so, stage two, it's really about helping the partners talk primary emotion to primary emotion. And when partners talk primary to primary, that's a corrective emotional experience. So it's in stage two that we'll repair attachment injuries, which are injuries to the relationship's bond. You know, infidelity is a common attachment injury. We'll really repair and have corrective emotional experiences around key moments of disconnection through the history of their relationship. If they don't have any attachment injuries, it's still a corrective emotional experience to lead with my vulnerabilities and have my partner reach back in a way that helps me, loves me. My partner is an antidote to my stress. When I have these fears I can share them with my partner and they'll respond with loving reassurance, and helps me know that even my fears are loveable and I, I know I'm not alone. So it helps me, helps me cope. I'm, I, you know, as Jim Cohen(ph) says, "We're each other's", you know, "co-regulators." We need each other to help regulate ourselves when those fears come for us and grip us. 

01:02:15
SIMON RICH So, and then this, this last phase. So, what, what happens in phase three as we, as, as, EFT comes down the home stretch? 

01:02:20
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah. So, the EFT therapist who's been actively choreographing it and, you know, passing out the meat and potatoes, if that metaphor fits, hands, hands the meat, hands the meat and potatoes over to the client. We really pass the process back to the client and celebrate the risk they took, and the hard work they did to earn this secure connection with each other. We help them look back at where they got stuck and how they got disconnected, and how they took the risk to open, to reach, and to share with their vulnerabilities leading the way, and how that lead to a whole new way of being together, a whole new way of talking, a whole new way of interacting. So, stage three of EFT is the briefest stage. It could be as few as one to three sessions, and it's really celebrating where the couple, the growth and the journey of the couple, and really handing the success over to them, and helping them integrate it, and create a narrative of how we got disconnected and how we'll get reconnected. Of course, we know all couples will fight and we'll lose our connection. The whole point is, what can we do to repair and reconnect? So we want to normalize very much that they will get disconnected again, that's inevitable, but they found their way back to each other and they'll continually find their way back to each other as they move through the end of stage two and into stage three and out of, and out of therapy. 

01:03:45
SIMON RICH Yes, and they have the tools to take care of what, what comes up and you may see them occasionally for a booster session from time to time, but that's, that's where the process goes. 

01:03:55
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah, I tell the couple, "I look forward to being obsolete." That- 

01:03:55
SIMON RICH Uh-huh. Right. 

01:04:00
KATHRYN RHEEM You know, I literally want to hand their process back to them so they can intervene on their relationship's behalf. 

01:04:05
SIMON RICH Okay. Right. Alright, well we just, we are out of time here. So just, two things: one, again, my reminder to you all out there who have been listening to the conversation. Now is the opportunity for the conversation to have its ripple effect. So, there's a link to the comment board. We're very interested in hearing your observation, your questions, your brainstorms, your amplifications on points that were part of this conversation. Kathryn has very graciously agreed to make sure she goes up to the comment board and, and respond as, as is appropriate and, and as she's so moved. Kathryn, to the people who are intrigued by EFT or looking for training opportunities, or reading materials or resources, where can they go? 

01:04:55
KATHRYN RHEEM Yeah, there's ICEEFT, the International Center for Excellence in EFT is, is Sue's organization in Ottawa. It's ICEEFT.com, and there's an amazing amount of resources on that website for all things EFT. And I'm the director of the local Washington Baltimore Center for EFT, Washington, D.C. area.
