Keeping Kids Healthy 

00:01:10
WINNIE KING MD Hello. I'm Dr. Winnie King and I'm here with some experts on childhood obesity and the lobby of the Children's Hospital at Montefiore in New York City. So you can expect to hear and see some activity in the background. I'm sure you've heard that the percentage of children who are overweight is higher than ever before. But did you realize that a third of today's kids are too heavy and that number has quadrupled since 1970s. What you may not know is that the long-term consequences of this trend are deadly. Some experts say that 200,000 people die each year as a result of obesity. But the great news is that the threat to your kids is preventable because there are ways to help your child fight this disease and to prevent it from developing in the first place. Here is Cristina story. 

00:02:00
CRISTINA GARCIA I was skinny at first but I love food, sugar foods, so I started to gain weight, gain weight and gain weight. And so like then I was big and I was… maybe I don't know 30 pounds of weight or something like that. Like everybody else is (inaudible ) and I felt like bad because I didn't look they did. 

00:02:20
SARA GARCIA Cristina's Mother Cristina was a lonely girl and she… I think that she is watching too much TV because she don't feel like go out with friends. 

00:02:30
CRISTINA GARCIA 16 Years Old Since I was bigger, I didn't feel like being noticed and I didn't want anybody to necessarily talk about me. I felt like people were judging me, then I felt bad and I felt depressive, I felt sad and I… like I ate and I ate, it's like leave myself. 

00:02:50
SARA GARCIA When you find these people, do you cook too much rice, beans. You're not thinking about your health. You are only thinking about food, more than three times a day you eat because you're wanting to see your kids healthy life, you know fat healthy. 

00:03:05
Mother Cabrini High School, NYC 

00:03:05
KATHIE DOLGIN Known as "High Voltage" The (inaudible ) program is something that I've been doing for 25 years and it's a lifestyle empowerment program. You know it's kind of a cross between the workout and (inaudible ) meeting, but it's all about teaching the kids how they eat to empower themselves, body, mind, soul complete lifestyle. 

00:03:25
CRISTINA GARCIA I started to lose weight and so people were noticing me and telling something like oh my goodness you're losing weight. (inaudible )the healthy food has no flavor, it tastes like like nothing or it will taste bad… really bad. So I wouldn't be motivated to eat it. 

00:03:45
SARA GARCIA I saw when...when she coming home and I offered the regular food rice and beans. She don't want it. She don't want nothing fried. She said no mummy no fry. 

00:03:55
BRIAN DONAHUE Head of Mother Cabrini High School Since voltage has come to Mother Cabrini High School, every students awareness of importance of healthy eating and exercise has been heightened 

00:04:05
CRISTINA GARCIA It completely changed my life and I lost about 57 pounds, so I really, really feel better now and I don't… I'm not depressed anymore and I'm more energetic. 

00:04:20
 I'm happy, I'm happy, I can change whatever I want. 

00:04:25
KATHIE DOLGIN Thinking positive is not just oh! think positive, what does that mean? I mean you really have to work at it. But if you wake up every morning and say I'm happy, I'm healthy, I'm energized. Your brain is like a computer, whatever you feed that computer is what it starts to believe. 

00:04:35
CRISTINA GARCIA Yeah I did lose the weight, but like that's not the main thing that actually I got out of this program. Um… I actually got out of this program a way to be healthier, a way to feel better about myself, a way to exercise daily and a way to be me and be who I am. 

00:04:55
WINNIE KING And Cristina is with us now. Cristina, how do you stay motivated to keep healthy? 

00:05:00
CRISTINA GARCIA Um… Basically I feel more energetic, I'm healthier. I feel more to able to do things and I… my self-esteem helps, so that's basically… 

00:05:10
WINNIE KING Now how hard was it to get your mum to change the way she cooks? 

00:05:15
CRISTINA GARCIA It was actually very-very difficult because she was afraid of issues like she will try anything. But in my family, it was… they're twisted to it, but my father didn't really like it because he liked the old way, but they like it now. 

00:05:30
WINNIE KING Yeah and they finally kind of came around and now everybody eats that way, well, that's great. Dr. Michele Calderoni is a pediatrician specializing in kids with obesity. Dr. Calderoni why are we seeing these incredible numbers of obesity in children? 

00:05:45
MICHELE CALDERONI, O.D. Pediatrician Children's Hospital at Montefiore That's a great question Dr. King. You know there is a variety of factors that are contributing to the obesity epidemic, which makes this a very complicated process. However, there is two real reasons why kids gain weight. One is unhealthy eating and the second is lack of physical activity. If we look at trends over time, we can tell that kids these days are eating more processed and pre-packaged food and more fast food, which are all high in calories, high in fat and high in sugar. In addition to that we know that the portion sizes have greatly increased over the last 20 years. When we look at physical activity trends, we see that with the advance of technology, TV, video games, television, cars, elevators, we know that people are getting less and less activity, so the child has an unhealthy eating habit and has absolutely no physical activity the net result is weight gain, which over time equals obesity and being overweight. 

00:06:40
WINNIE KING Well, we certainly know as doctors the long-term consequences of obesity. I mean it's really one of the major contributors to death right now in our country. But explain to our parents listening, why do we need to care so much about weighting kids? 

00:06:55
MICHELE CALDERONI Well, there have been many, many national studies which have shown that there are very severe medical complications even in children and adolescents who are overweight. One of the biggest problems we need to worry about is type 2 diabetes. 

00:07:05
HEALTH RISKS • Type 2 Diabetes • Asthma • Psychosocial effects 

00:07:05
MICHELE CALDERONI If a child gets type 2 diabetes as a child or adolescent, they have a high likelihood of getting some of the really severe complications like blindness, kidney disease, heart disease. We also know that asthma gets worse when you are obese as well. There is also psycho… psychosocial problems like depression, low self-esteem. 

00:07:20
WINNIE KING Right and we just heard… we just heard our patient here tell us about how she or her self-esteem you know was affected by being overweight and now you know having lost the weight, you know Cristinayou feel so much better about yourself. There are… there are other health risks too, things like high blood pressure. 

00:07:35
• Hypertension • Orthopedic Complications • Sleep Apnea • Cardiovascular Problems 

00:07:40
MICHELE CALDERONI Absolutely, some of the diseases that we think about as adult diseases, things as you said hypertension, high cholesterol, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease and orthopedic problems as well. 

00:07:50
WINNIE KING Yeah. We… we're actually finding now unfortunately when children die ah… and we perform autopsy on them. We're finding evidence of cardiovascular disease in children, which is making a very clear that the obesity problem is something that's impacting their health even when they are young kids. This isn't something that happens you know when they are much older. Cristina did you ever have to worry about any health problems? Was that ever part of what made you decide to lose weight? 

00:08:10
CRISTINA GARCIA Definitely. Um… my doctor had told me that I was a little overweight and to try to… because of the… all the risk factors and things like that and this also could be genetic because my grandmother, my… my… my uncle, all have health and type 2 diabetes. 

00:08:25
WINNIE KING Okay. Yeah, so you already knew that you're at risk and it was so good because lot of doctors don't really say anything to kids when they are overweight, but you were setup for having those problems down the road. So good job. Now doctors can tell you over and over about all the things you should do to lose weight, but that doesn't make it any easier to break a lifetime of that habits, but a very unusual school in California is trying to do just that. Academy of the Sierras is a boarding school exclusively for obese kids. We spent a day with Terry Henry, who has already lost a 100 pounds in just three months and he still has 200 pounds to go before he reaches his goal. 

00:09:10
TERRY HENRY 16 Years Old This morning we have to do a sport, which we have to do every morning. We have a choice of (inaudible ), street hockey, fitness center or walking. I was heavy all my life and would not stress out. I would probably go into the kitchen, I would eat to kick my mind off of my actual problems. 

00:09:30
RYAN CRAIG Executive Director, Academy of the Sierras In terms of weight loss, students are losing about 5 pounds a week here so far. 

00:09:40
TERRY HENRY You basically have anything that you want here. It's (inaudible ) put certain things together like you're gonna have (inaudible ) too much carbs. I'm just wondering I'm gonna have some yogurt, you can have as much as of it as you want, it really doesn't matter because these are really low in calorie and almost have no fat. Growing up in school, like I had made fun of a whole lunch and like in the (inaudible ) stuff. The kids would always like watch what I got and whether it was too much or something or too less or anything and when I was walking down they made like noises like Godzillan stuff about me walking and stuff they just… It's sort of torment to me a little bit, but basically (inaudible ) inside that's what I did. Everyday breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks we got to write down what you eat and how many calories and fat grams in it, the time that you ate it. It makes me writing all this down, it's kind of hard at first as you're basically not used to it, but after a couple of weeks it just becomes a habit. 

00:10:50
RYAN CRAIG Self monitoring is a key element of being accountable. What you're doing when you're monitoring is you are writing down everything that you're eating, everything that you're doing in terms of your physical activity and that's making sure that what you're doing is not mindless, it's mindful and when… when you're mindful of what you're doing, you're gonna make better decisions. 

00:11:05
TERRY HENRY My brain doesn't have the basically switch or whatever in it that basically tells me whether I'm fool or not because I mean I never know whether I'm really fool. Now breakfast is over and… and school. 

00:11:25
 That's something that we… we're not really familiar with like the… 

00:11:25
TERRY HENRY The environment here is a really big change. I mean here everybody can relate to each other. We all have weight problems. We all have emotional problems and if we need someone that talk to, we are all there for each A dinner basically every day we have to write our steps up. It sort of puts a lot of competition between us all even though it's not supposed to, you try to get as many steps as you can. I think I've made a little progress and getting some things done and I'm just one more step closer to making my goal. 

00:12:00
WINNIE KING What a great program!. Rachel Siegel is a social worker who helps obese children in a struggle to lose weight. Rachel what can we learn from kids at this program? 

00:12:10
Keep a food diary 

00:12:10
RACHEL SIEGEL, L.M.S.W. Social Worker, Children’s Hospital at Montefiore Well I saw some great things on that program. For one keeping a food diary is one of the hardest task as a kid. But at the same time one of the most effective tools. A lot of us eat unconsciously and that really raises the awareness and raises the consciousness. And not only that, it lets them own their problem and participate in it. The other thing that they mention was portion size. 

00:12:30
Reduce Portion Size Use a pedometer 

00:12:30
RACHEL SIEGEL I think most of us eat out of visual hunger. 

00:12:30
WINNIE KING Hmmm… Hmm. Sure. 

00:12:30
RACHEL SIEGEL Eat with our eyes. So just simple techniques of you know making a plate smaller is so much more visually appealing and it's a very easy thing to do and to be effective and then last but not least they said. 

00:12:50
RACHEL SIEGEL They said he uses a pedometer to measure his activity and studies are showing more and more that activity is just as important as exercise is. So if you're not fully exercising and you can have that instantaneous gratification on a daily basis where you actually measure your success get that immediate reward. It's something that you can do with the whole family. You can set up the competition. It's a wonderful tool. 

00:13:10
WINNIE KING That's great and so with a pedometer you just buy one of these, you just put them on and you just walk around and it gives you feedback as to how much walking you're doing. 

00:13:15
RACHEL SIEGEL Right. 

00:13:20
WINNIE KING So you can actually have a number. It's so… that's really such a great way to really get a sense of how much movement you're doing because you… you can look back and say oh! yeah, yeah, yeah I did all of that and you really didn't do that much at all. What… what can parents do to incorporate healthier habits at home? 

00:13:30
Don't be a food dictator 

00:13:35
RACHEL SIEGEL Well I think for one thing, we have to take parents out of the dictator role. You don't wanna be a dictator. You wanna create a structure for your children. You really wanna set up maybe mealtimes and you know some rules around food, but you don't wanna be the police, because there is so shame upped up into obesity and you don't wanna create a situation where there is a rebellion formed. 

00:13:55
WINNIE KING And that could be so easy to do though because you are so frustrated as a parent and you wanna just control this. Um… Creating choices makes a big difference? 

00:14:00
Create Choices 

00:14:05
RACHEL SIEGEL It really does. I mean I think that substitute...you have to… you have to find good substitutes. You're not gonna eat a carrot stick when you want a potato chip, but to have a lot of healthy choices like a kudos bar or air popped popcorn in the home and loading the home full of snacks creates choices and allows the child to make a good selection and not have to put a lot of decision into it. 

00:14:25
WINNIE KING Now involving the whole family, this is really important, isn't it? 

00:14:25
Involve the whole family 

00:14:30
RACHEL SIEGEL Absolutely. Like they say, that is a family affair. We all have to work together and to create activities that you can do together simple as planning a family day, going into the (inaudible [00:14:41) zoo, you know going to the mall, walking around together, taking a walk after dinner, all great ways not only to bond, but also be effective in your weight loss. 

00:14:50
WINNIE KING And I think they would also be ah… better emotionally for the child. You know if you got one child, let's get away problem in the family and you just give them their food and everyone else eats their food. It really does sort of heighten the awareness about it being a weight problem and that really probably is detrimental to them, not doing the right thing. Um… What about using food as a reward? That's a big no, no. 

00:15:10
Don't use food as reward 

00:15:10
RACHEL SIEGEL I think that we get wrapped up in giving something all the time. Praise is so important. Just praise your children. Pay attention to what they do. Put the report card on refrigerator. All that has a same impact. When we use food as a reward, it just… it… it makes you always use… it… it just brings more events that is not needed. 

00:15:30
WINNIE KING Yeah, whenever I think you would just sort of train you that whenever something good happens you go eat, you know because you get used to the idea of food being part of any event you know that's positive and that… that sort of sets up the wrong cycle. Um… You also feel that maybe a support group could be helpful sometimes. 

00:15:45
Consider a support group 

00:15:45
RACHEL SIEGEL Oh definitely statistics back that up. Anyone that takes an active role with their peers when you feel comfortable. 

00:15:55
WINNIE KING Sure. 

00:15:55
RACHEL SIEGEL And you don't feel comfortable all the time being an overweight and two, it keeps that focus coming back week to week you're remanded that you're still working on something and it's a helpful way to get from your peers as opposed to your parents, good ideas of what actually works. 

00:16:10
WINNIE KING And then setting realistic goals is important and that's true of adults, not only kids you know, I wanna lose 20 pounds in two days, it's not gonna to happen. It's really important to set the goals realistically. 

00:16:15
Be realistic - set small goals 

00:16:20
RACHEL SIEGEL Right, right. And I think we do, we come from all-or-nothing kind of society, either you're on a diet and you're perfect or you're a complete mess and messing up everything. So to have a balance and to set realistic goals, it takes six weeks to make a habit. And when you make a habit all these little habits that build up create a lifestyle change. We wanna get people away from the diet mentality and more into lifestyle changes. So if you set realistic goals such as an 80% like I'm gonna stick to this 80% in a time as opposed to a 100% in a time. You're more likely to have long-term success. 

00:16:50
WINNIE KING Sure, well Cristina have you ever used any of these tools when you were losing your weight? 

00:16:55
CRISTINA GARCIA Definitely I… they… they asked us if you're wanting to use a food diary and it definitely makes you more aware of what you eat and if you eat a lot of something and then you start to make better choices maybe if I don't eat this as much or don't have bread everyday or something like that, definitely does help you. 

00:17:15
WINNIE KING It does help. Well, Michele what would say is the most important thing the parents can do to help their children who are overweight? 

00:17:20
MICHELE CALDERONI I think the most important thing a parent could do is to really be a supportive role model. And what I mean by that is focus on making very gradual small changes that the entire family engages in. As you said earlier, then the child won't feel isolated or stigmatized and if the child sees other family members engaging in change, they may be more likely to make those changes themselves. 

00:17:40
WINNIE KING And that's what we want, the subtle changes that add up. You know like most problems, obesity is easier to stop before it starts. But how early? Well, wait to see what one head start preschool class is doing. Jim Bunn has that story. 

00:17:55
 Up and down, up and down up and down and stop. 

00:18:05
JIM BUNN What you're looking at here is a unique effort to keep kids from getting fat in the first place. 

00:18:10
DONNA TERJESEN Jump Start Program Director The anecdotal comments coming back from the parents were very clear. The parents were going… their children going home and asking their parents for healthy foods. 

00:18:20
JIM BUNN This is PS5 in New York City. The obesity prevention program here run by the Children's Aid Society is one of only a few liked(ph) in the United States. 

00:18:30
DONNA TERJESEN We're gonna do your head and your shoulder, just take off. Body tracing is pre-awareness that they actually have a body. And what we're gonna to be talking about during the program is how to feed the body and why it's important to eat healthy food. And at the end of the 24 weeks, we're doing this again to show that their body grows. 

00:18:50
JIM BUNN Even at age 5, kids like Joshua Moody get it. 

00:18:55
JOSHUA MOODY 5 Years Old We learn about our body. 

00:19:00
JIM BUNN What… and what are you learning about your body? 

00:19:00
JOSHUA MOODY Because (inaudible ) you taught that's why you eat good food. 

00:19:05
JIM BUNN Of course the kids can't make changes in their diet by themselves. 

00:19:10
DONNA TERJESEN Today we are going to learn how to make a healthy, creamy, delicious salad and salad dressing. 

00:19:20
JIM BUNN So the program targets parents too. Parents like Irma Mojica are not only shown how to make healthy foods, they are shown how to reduce stress because many people grownups and children overeat when they feel stressed. 

00:19:35
IRMA MOJICA Mom and Program Participant My 3-year-old has a lot of anxiety attacks where she has just finished eating, but she… she says that I still have food and shall I pick up my plate and things like that. 

00:19:45
JIM BUNN Irma's program even includes getting weight. So she can set a personal weigh loss school as she learns how to prepare healthier foods for her children. 

00:19:55
IRMA MOJICA It's important for me to find out how to prepare healthier meals and set base for my children so they learn how to eat better. 

00:20:05
 And shake your ankle, good, okay, nice job. 

00:20:10
WINNIE KING Okay. Let's try to apply what these families are learning. For one thing, everyone says that kids learn better eating habits when they help prepare healthy foods for themselves. Cathy Nonas you're a nutritionist and you're here with Max as your helper. Where do we start? 

00:20:25
CATHY NONAS Nutritionist, North General Hospital Oh! well, you start with breakfast of course. Look how quick it is. Max can you just pour this? We're using a non-sugar or low-sugar cereal and he's just pouring it in and we're going… he's gonna pour the milk and you can see, he can do it himself Well, I'm getting dressed, ready to take up to school. Look at that. Okay, thank you. 

00:20:45
WINNIE KING And this is something that most people that have a weight problem tend to not do eat breakfast. 

00:20:50
CATHY NONAS Kids tend not to eat breakfast, those kids who tend not to eat breakfast tend to be heavier. So we want all kids to eat breakfast, plus it's a great way to get your nutrition. Look Max will you pour the milk in? That's my daughter's favorite thing to do. And then while he is doing that, Cristina will make some hot cereal because that's also pretty good, particularly these days in winter. 

00:21:10
WINNIE KING Yeah, see, that's pretty simple, no brain, alright. 

00:21:10
CATHY NONAS Pretty simple. She puts it in water, she puts it in the microwave, she has got it. 

00:21:15
WINNIE KING Okay. Now what do you do if you're in a big rush. 

00:21:20
CATHY NONAS Well I often use some waffles for instance, just put 'em in the toaster or you could use one of these. These are protein bars and they're pretty good in fiber and calcium and protein. There you are. You see how quick that was. 

00:21:35
WINNIE KING And then ah… we have peanut butter sandwich, that's a choice too. 

00:21:40
CATHY NONAS Well I really like this, peanut butter sandwich, ah… particularly because you can make it the night before, just give it to your kid on the way out and the child can get to school early. 

00:21:50
WINNIE KING Um. 

00:21:50
CATHY NONAS And eat it at the cafeteria there. 

00:21:50
WINNIE KING And then beautiful fruit. 

00:21:55
CATHY NONAS Well fruit is really healthy for you. It's high in fiber and so you could just take a banana, Max loves 'em, right? And he can even put in a cereal if he has time. 

00:22:05
WINNIE KING Right. So it's really, really not that hard, pretty easy uh… Cristina? 

00:22:10
CRISTINA GARCIA Sure it is. 

00:22:10
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:22:10
CATHY NONAS It's pretty easy. It's really healthy for you and kids will get thinner if they do it. 

00:22:15
WINNIE KING Now what about sending your kids off with a bottle of juice. 

00:22:20
CATHY NONAS Well I think that actually kids drink too many of their calories. So I'm always for them eating the fruit, which has the fiber in it. Believe it or not, apple juice, for instance this amount of apple juice has this amount of sugar in it. So we're feeding our babies all the sugar, but if you give a little more, you know our bottles are getting bigger. Look how much sugar is in here. 

00:22:40
WINNIE KING More sugar. 

00:22:45
CATHY NONAS And even more people think that there is no sugar in something that's clear. All sodas have a tremendous amount of sugar, 16 teaspoons of sugar. So we're really drinking our calories and we're getting very little nutrition. 

00:22:55
WINNIE KING And kids can drink you know three, four, five of these a day and you can just imagine how much sugar that adds up to. 

00:23:00
CATHY NONAS And I do. 

00:23:05
WINNIE KING Yeah. Well now how can you make healthy foods for other meals of your little kids? 

00:23:05
CATHY NONAS Well one of the things is if you ask Max, I bet there is something here that he probably doesn't like. I bet it's the green pepper because I asked him before. Is that right? 

00:23:15
MAX Yeah. 

00:23:20
WINNIE KING But he likes everything else, that's great. 

00:23:20
CATHY NONAS But he likes everything else. So I got to like to separate all these vegetables and that way the child can kind of put them together and you can make it a game and sometimes that the green peppers are touching in other vegetable, the child won't eat it. 

00:23:30
WINNIE KING Right. 

00:23:30
CATHY NONAS So if they put in the things that they like, it will be really good. And oftentimes you can get the child to pick out a vegetable that they are interested in and you can experiment as a whole family, right? 

00:23:40
WINNIE KING Any final thoughts about meals and the… the best way to eat healthy? 

00:23:45
Eat without the TV 

00:23:45
CATHY NONAS I think there are a number of things that people need to think about as a whole family. One is to not watch television while they eat. That's a really big one to try and eat in one room in the house where there is no television and it's also a wonderful time for families to get together and discuss the day's events. 

00:24:00
Avoid sugar drinks 

00:24:05
CATHY NONAS And the second thing is again drink your water, drink milk, but try not to drink sugar calories. And the third thing is if you think about a plate, particularly your dinner plate, think about half your plate in vegetables and then everything becomes portion controlled and it also is much healthier for the whole family whether they're fat or thin. 

00:24:25
Serve smaller portions 

00:24:25
WINNIE KING Well you know I think that we sometimes get in the habit of eating what is given to us. So if you go to a restaurant and they give you a huge portion size, you eat it because you just kind of think there is a magical nutritional fairy back there that's decided that this is how much you're supposed to have. 

00:24:40
CATHY NONAS It's magical thinking, yeah. 

00:24:40
WINNIE KING Yeah. How do you… you know if you're out… 

00:24:40
CATHY NONAS Uh… Huh… 

00:24:40
WINNIE KING …you know with your kids you know how do you help them understand how much they should eat rather than just eating everything that's there. 

00:24:50
CATHY NONAS Well the perfect example is my own kids, I ask them what they like best in fast food restaurants, let's say, it's the French fries. So they get a small French fries and a salad.

WINNIE KING Okay. 

00:25:00
CATHY NONAS Perfect balance. They get what they want and they get the nutrition too. 

00:25:05
WINNIE KING Now tell me what a healthy dinner should look like because you know this is where most people eat. 

00:25:05
CATHY NONAS Right. 

00:25:10
WINNIE KING They don't… they'll miss breakfast, they may skip on lunch, but dinner always comes in 100%. What's a healthy dinner? 

00:25:15
Serve extra vegetables 

00:25:15
CATHY NONAS Well after this I hope they're not going to miss breakfast, but… but a healthy dinner, as I… you know as you asked in the restaurant for instance I always order an extra plate of vegetables for the whole table. And I think it's important for families to think maybe of even serving two vegetables just to get used to the idea, something green, something red. Vegetables are really colorful and in that color it's tons of nutrition. So the more colorful your plate the better it is. 

00:25:40
WINNIE KING Yeah. You know um… we get so focused on trying to eat healthy and so sometimes we sort of lose the joy… 

00:25:45
CATHY NONAS Right. 

00:25:50
WINNIE KING … of food. You feel that is important that people take time to really enjoy their food? 

00:25:50
CATHY NONAS Well I think so and naturally if they eat it while they are not watching television, they can concentrate on it more and enjoy it. So yeah I think people should enjoy it and as Cristina had said before she is learning that healthy food is delicious too. 

00:26:05
WINNIE KING Yes and we're so proud of her and Max do you enjoy your food when you eat it? 

00:26:05
MAX Yeah.
