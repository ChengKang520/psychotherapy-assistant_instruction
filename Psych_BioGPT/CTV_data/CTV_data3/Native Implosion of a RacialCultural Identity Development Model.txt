MARIE L. MIVILLE , Ph.D. This weekend has felt a little bit like a gathering of my family from Oklahoma. My first academic job I've ever had was at Oklahoma State and I was there for eight years. And I'll tell you, a Latino who grew up in Florida and went to school in Maryland to end up in Oklahoma, it was a little bit of a culture shock and… But I… I really took to the people and the land there and I just found folks there to be so generous and warm. Rockey's very much a brother and I still remember Jill, we met when we had just… each of us moved to Oklahoma at a Comanche gathering. And so, these are people I've known for many years since I actually started working in academia. So it does give me honor to… to present both Rockey and Jill for you. So I'll just read a little bit of the accomplishments, it’s in your brochure, but I’ll just… we like to honor both, all of our speakers by sharing with you what it is they've done, as well as the people what they are. So let me start with Dr. Hill. 

00:02:10
Native Implosion of a Racial/Cultural Identity Development Model Jill S. Hill, Ph.D. Teachers College, Columbia University Rockey R. Robbins, Ph.D. University of Oklahoma 

00:02:10
MARIE L. MIVILLE She is my colleague, right here at Teachers College, Columbia… Columbia University. I think Jessy made me get stuck on the word Columbia, right you go. And she is an Assistant Professor of psychology and education in my department, the Department of Counseling and Clinical Psychology. She is also a faculty affiliate at Columbia University Center for the study of ethnicity and race. And Dr. Hill received her Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from the University of Oklahoma and completed clinical postdoctoral studies up here in New York at Cornell University. Her research (inaudible ) interest in clinical interventions have been with indigenous groups, examination of disparities and mental health service accessibility, delivery and utilization that… that adversely affect indigenous people and the ethical and culturally valid approaches to research, particularly assessment. You know, Dr. Hill has been… was one of my collaborators in terms of structuring the overall conference that we had this year. And it's actually her words that begin our… the very title honoring, privileging indigenous voices and that was Dr. Hill's own words that actually have created the theme, helped to create the theme of this conference. She is recently published in a number of journals, including traumatology, cultural diversity in ethnic minority, psychology and our… and our colleague Dr. Sue's recent book on microaggressions. So that's Dr. Hill and then, of course, the inimitable Rockey Robbins, Cherokee Choctaw is an Associate Professor at the University of Oklahoma where he teaches multicultural counseling, behavior disorders and personality assessment. He has published over 30 articles during his 10-year as experience as professor. His research interests are absolutely many, almost infinite, including renorming psychological instruments for use with American-Indians, means of coping for Indian students in boarding schools, needs of therapists with… who work with Indian clients and studies that focus on American-Indian family resiliency. If you've ever been to a workshop that Dr. Robbins does, you will never forget it. He is just able to reach out to all of us. As one of his students just shared with me, he’s someone who actually helps you feel supported and as an expert but he also challenges you to wherever you need to go. The area that Rockey is currently working on is on American-Indian spirituality and he has created many, many programs. And we're so… we're thrilled to have both Dr. Robbins, Dr. Hill here with us today. Thank you.

[non-English song] 

00:07:35
JILL S. HILL So thank you, again. Thank you, Murray for that… that great introduction and thanks for honoring us with us with that song Jessy(ph). And I also want to… to thank all of you for coming. A lot of you I know traveled really long distances. So if you've never been to New York before, welcome to New York and I hope that you're enjoying your time. We're all happy that you're here. I also want to take an opportunity and thank the roundtable staff for all the hard work that they've done. The volunteers or students and they really work diligently to make sure that this conference comes off without a hitch and they do a fabulous job. Finally, I would like to thank the members of my research team. And they’re are… excuse me, they’re are fantastic group of students. And I'm really happy that they've helped me a lot on this project along with Rockey. You bet, sorry. Better? Great! And one more group I want to thank, because this really wouldn't have been possible without that group and it's really all of those scholars, researchers, and authors who have created identity development models before us and the work that they've done has just been incredible, fascinating and it's allowed us to think critically about what we're going to present to you today. And I just want to say that… that we’re examining one particular model with a great amount of respect, because that's what this work has meant to us and we're… we're just building from… from it really by adding our unique flavor to it. And then also with the talk I want to thank the person who made this possible and that's the young man that we interviewed, who for purposes of this talk we've named Harshi, we're calling him Harshi. And without him we wouldn't have had this data and we wouldn’t have had the opportunity to present what we're going to present to you. So we're clearly indebted to him. So hopefully, we hooked you with our title - Native Implosion of a Racial/Cultural Identity Development Model. And when we talk about implosion, it's basically a deconstruction of… of a model that exists and it's not in any way against… not to destroy the model. 

00:10:20
What is Implosion? A destructive method Not an effort to destroy Invitation to engage in discourse Meaning rather than Truth Helms (1995) People of Color Racial Identity Model 

00:10:25
JILL S. HILL It's basically to deconstruct it with respect and… and really provide an opportunity to engage in discourse of one another about that model and about a model that may be more appropriate for other people. And when… when we do deconstruction of a model, we're not seeking the truth, we're actually looking for meaning, because we can't… you know the… the word truth is with the capital T there that's… that's deliberate. So we're not… that's not what we're seeking. We're seeking meaning over truth. And the model that we're gonna take a look at is Janet Helms, people of color racial/cultural identity model from 1995. And if any of you ever take a licensing exam, they will ask you about this model. One thing I want to… I want to add is that, also with implosion is that, this type of approach is influenced by a lot of postmodern thinkers and philosophers for example, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Paulo Freire, and also a native American, Robert Warrior, that he's taken these kinds of approaches in his work as well. And I want to say just a little about Harshi the young man that we interviewed. He is from the southern Midwest. He is a very, very traditional Indian man and he is a sun dancer. And he was, you know, his life and… and wisdoms after we kind of take a look at… at his experiences through this model, they seem somewhat incongruous with the model that Helms proposes. We interviewed him about his life and experiences and how he came to be who he is today and we developed an entire study based on these interviews. I wish we had time to go into everything, but we don’t. So we're gonna try to keep it pretty concise today. The one thing that we would like to do, though, is… is engaging discourse with all of you, what we're here together for the short amount of time. So anytime, you know, if I throw questions out at you, please throw your answers back at me. Don’t be shy. One basic Indian value as humor and it's very important to us. When we talk about creating a model, we… we say that with an ironic smile, because we understand at a very profound level that we can never create anything that encapsulates all reality or all experience. So again, this is… this is a… we'll deconstruct our own model too at the end. So it's… we did this with a lot of humor too. But it's… we take it seriously as well. So let's just jump right in. 

00:13:25
Conformity (Pre-encounter) Status Devaluing of one's own group; allegiance to White standards of merit; obliviousness to socioracial concerns (Helms, 1995, p. 186) 

00:13:30
JILL S. HILL This is Janet Helms' first status in her models, conformity or pre-encounter status. And it's a devaluing of one's own group allegiance to white standards of merit and obliviousness to… to socioracial concerns. So what, then, does… you know, if you think about conformity, what does it mean? And what does this mean in relationship to Indian people then? And is it congruent with what you know about Indian people? Is this some of you… anybody? Yes, no? Very shy today. Okay. It's okay. It's alright. We'll answer. Well, let’s take a look at something from the interview. This is… this is what Harshi said, "My dad visited a medicine man when I was born, Big Pond, with my sister and mom. He gave me a blessing. 

00:14:25
"My dad visited a medicine man when I was born, Big Pond, with my sister and mom. He gave me a blessing." 

00:14:25
JILL S. HILL How might this statement fit in with the definition of the conformity status that Helms uses? Or does it? There is a time when an Indian person is born, okay, and this is the moment when they’re experiencing what we call in unity, it's not conformity. And even if this moment lasts just for a minute, it's there and it's a time that we all live in before we need to be healed. So we're born and it's… we're in unity with everything. Nothing… it's pre all that other stuff that… that conformity jumps into already. Does that make sense? Okay. So the… the main thing is we begin life with the unitary awareness. We don’t start out with maladjustment. We start out with wholeness. And so that's the… that's the point we're making here the differentiation, unique element that a native person starts out with. And then again, we're not saying that other people don’t start out this way. I think actually we all start out this way, but this is kind of our perspective. So as it stands away, this status is defined. It represents a pseudo-unitary experience, okay. So it's… it's one that's based on defending ourselves against isolation and alienation by absorbing into our spirit something that's not necessarily who we are. We absorb this external influence and I'm referring back to that definition that Helms uses. Another form of implosion is the consideration of costume. And what are some of the unique costumes of conformity that you may have seen Indian people wear? Anybody have an idea about that? Do you want to take a stab at…? Alright, well, we'll just keep going then. We'll take a look at what Harshi says. 

00:16:35
“My mom and dad had problems. My mother took drugs so I was put in foster care when I was 3 years old. My mom was taking pills…my dad would call when I was in foster care once a day. I remember crying and just being angry. The foster parents were two good white people. They really didn’t know how to take care of me as an Indian person… Gradually I wanted to dissociate myself from the stereotype of drunk Indians. I just wanted to fit in with the other kids at school who played video games and watched tv.” 

00:16:35
JILL S. HILL Alright, let me read this for… for some of those in the back. My mom and dad had problems. My mother took drugs so I was put in foster care when I was 3 years old. My mom was taking pills. My dad would call when I was in foster care once a day. I remember crying and just being angry. The foster parents were two good white people. They really didn’t know how to take care of me as an Indian person. Gradually I wanted to dissociate myself from the stereotype of drunk Indians. I… I just wanted to fit in with the other kids at school who played video games and watched tv. So when I talk about those unique costumes, what are the unique costumes that are evidenced here in this particular quote? These unique costumes is where I'm referring to, Indiansconfront unique obstacles and invisible influences one of which is historical trauma. Okay and that's… that's very evident in this quote. And historical trauma for those of you who may not be familiar with it is history of extreme cultural denigration and just genocide basically against native people. And under that umbrella of… of historical traumas is colonization and the artifacts of colonization are still, you know, heavily felt in our communities today, drug and alcohol issues, foster care and cross adoption… cross cultural adoption issues, the problem Indian people so often depicted negatively as lazy or drunkards. So there is a high likelihood that a young native person may actually internalize those images and generalize from a few examples and consequently want to dissociate themselves from their tribe or culture. So that also then adds to the battle to keep our language, to continue our ceremonies, to maintain our land, to… to sustain our epistemological perspectives and way of life. At the end of this quote, though, again we chose the quotes that could fit into Helms model, but we're… we're turning them on their heads basically, turning the model on his head. So at the end of this quote, I just want to fit in with the other kids at school who played video games and watched tv. That's a pseudo-unitary experience, isn't it? So that's really… actually quite relevant to that conformity status. So that's… But there are so many other unique elements within that quote and those are the ones we're picking out to develop our model. Okay. 

00:19:00
Dissonance (Encounter) Status Ambivalence/confusion about one's own socioracial group commitment; ambivalent self-definition; may repress anxiety-provoking racial information (Helms, 1995, p. 186) 

00:19:05
JILL S. HILL So the next status is a dissonance or encounter status from Helms' model. This is ambivalence and confusion about one's own socioracial group commitment ambivalent self-definition, person may repress anxiety-provoking racial information. And according to Helms, certain events service catalysts that cause the person to reconsider the unquestioned acceptance of the dominant culture. So what might be an event that may lead an Indian person to engage in such a reexamination? Anybody? No. Yes, yes, absolutely and… and a lot of what Harshi talked about were his school experiences, absolutely. In… In those experiences he talks about experiencing extreme prejudice and discrimination that absolutely proved to be catalyst. In this quote let me read it. 

00:20:00
"I was having night terrors, really bad ones. I was 12. I went to an NAC [Native American Church] meeting and kept watching the firekeeper, feeling strong, hearing songs and the drum, and I felt like I belonged again. The firekeeper seemed to have a connection with the fire and it seemed like the fire was part of me. I never had night terrors again. I think that was the first time I started to believe in Indian ways." 

00:20:00
JILL S. HILL I was having night terrors, really bad ones. I was 12. I went to an NAC or Native American Church meeting and kept watching the firekeeping… keeper, feeling strong, hearing songs and the drum, and I felt like I belonged again. The firekeeper seemed to have a connection with the fire and it seemed like the fire was part of me. I never had night terrors again. I think that was the first time I started to believe in Indian ways. His response to this ritual would not have been possible with outraces of his earlier connections to Indian culture, spirituality and life ways. That's what we're talking about in that first part. We're… We're born not needing to be healed, okay, so this is… that's what I am tracing back to. This awakening, as evidenced in this quote, is not necessarily in reaction to something, but it emerges out of a positive connection with one's own culture. It's important to emphasize that it's… it's not a negative reaction to the dominant culture. It says no reaction or anything to do with the dominant culture whatsoever. In fact, identity development does not have to be all about reaction to the dominant culture. That's… that's another place where we differ with Helms' model and actually several other models about any development. To define yourself against anything rather than defining yourself for something can contaminate future perspectives. In this instance, it was a peyote meeting or traditional ceremony and positive modeling for Harshi. That awakening emerged from the space of sacred ritual. 

00:21:40
Immersion/Emersion Status Idealization of one's own socioracial group; denigration of that which is perceived as White; hypervigilance toward racial stimuli (Helms, 1995, p. 186) 

00:21:40
JILL S. HILL This is Helms' next status immersion/emersion and this involves idealization of one's own socioracial group denigration of that which is perceived as white; hypervigilance towards racial stimuli. And just so you kind of get the remnant(ph) of this. I'm presenting definitions over statuses and then the quotes are basically the implosions of those statuses. Okay. So this particular one. 

00:22:05
"Then I thought the only good people were Indians. I wouldn’t read anything except Sherman Alexie. I would only pray in my tribal language. At a peyote meeting, if anyone prayed to Jesus I crossed them off my list. I learned a bunch of our songs too. But I felt phony a lot because I could never get pure enough… my car wasn't enough of a heap to be an Indian car, and I didn’t speak my language as well as I should." 

00:22:05
JILL S. HILL Then I thought the only good people were Indians. I wouldn’t read anything except Sherman Alexie. I would only pray in my tribal language. At a peyote meeting, if anyone prayed to Jesus I crossed them off my list. I learned a bunch of our songs too. But I felt phony a lot because I could never get pure enough. My car wasn't enough of a heap to be an Indian car and I didn’t speak my language as well as I should. So this particular status immersion/emersion is a little bit tougher to implode quite honestly and it's pretty easy to see how these statements up above might fit in with Helms' conceptualization. So what might be some unique elements involved in what Harshi said. Do you want to take a stab at that? Okay, well, we'll just go on to the next, maybe it'll become a little bit clear. 

00:22:50
"I couldn’t just be… I was hating people and was always looking for a 'skin' to be around. I wouldn’t ever date a non-Indian. I'm still like this some. I have to keep our race and ways going and if you relax too much, their ways take over and race and culture disappear." 

00:22:55
JILL S. HILL I couldn’t just be. I was hating people and was always looking for a skin to be around. I wouldn’t never… I wouldn’t ever date a non-Indian. I'm still like this some. I have to keep our race and ways going and if you relax too much, their ways take over and race and culture disappear. Again, this is a pretty good example of immersion/emersion status. So the energy he puts into being separate protects him and even energizes him to revitalize and preserve traditions, but it keeps him hypervigilant and in this hypervigilance, it's a state of destructive corroding hatred. His tribal spirituality and life ways allow him to recognize a poison and open the door for further development. Additionally, Harshi's ethnocentrism evidenced here, we don’t view it as simply negative. Actually, we view it as anger, masking self-determination, which is a very important concept in… in indigenous, all indigenous communities. We value righteous indignation or ethnocentricity not as racism but as survival. So place within a native American context, this trace of anger cannot be equated with racism because of how nearly annihilated we were. In these statements we see the value of not needing validation from the dominant culture and I think Dr. Parham(ph) was mentioning this a little bit earlier, do not seek validation from your oppressor. That's very inherent in these… these words right here. So these statements then implode the liberal idea of progress towards integration. There must be separateness here so that there can be union eventually. So we need to be separate before we can be together in a way and that makes a little more sense a little bit later. What we're saying is we acknowledge the need to experience differences long enough so that we can ultimately have unity. Do you want to add anything to that, Rockey? Okay! 

00:25:00
ROCKEY R. ROBBINS This is a really hard thing for some people to understand. Last year when we were here, when you were presenting, there were some people saying come on, you need to make it in… make it in western society. It becomes successful in the west. You need to really push yourself in education and you need to do away with your boarding schools and get in… get in regular schools. That’s what a person told us in the audience. And we had the hardest time explaining to that person that if we give in to that and we cease to have our boarding schools for instance, we now have capitalism and your own American culture for the most part totally devours small groups of people like Indian people. And so, we have to resist that. And so we maintain, even with all the problems with our boarding schools and I know you've heard of them. We still feel like we need to take really effective action to maintain our differences. And people don’t understand that. I mean, it's a very hard thing for people to understand, but it's very real for us and it's something that we have to emphasize. 

00:26:20
JILL S. HILL Thank you, thanks. 

00:26:20
Internalization Status Positive commitment to one's own socioracial group; internally defined racial attributes; capacity to assess/respond objectivity to members of dominant group; flexible (Helms, 1995, p. 186) 

00:26:20
JILL S. HILL So we're gonna move on to the next status the internalization status. And this is positive commitment to one's own socioracial group, internally defined racial attributes, capacity to assess and respond objectivity to members of dominant group. There is a flexibility inherent within this status. I'll read the quote. 

00:26:40
"When I was in the sweat, I found that I could breathe and I could keep breathing. Certain people will come into your life and help you breathe one more breath and it's not just Indians. It can be white people and black people, everyone… It's true and sometimes good in your heart. What's sad is that after I'd come out of the sweat, getting a Coke on my way home at a 7-11, I would again start thinking about how different I am from white people, a little judgmental." 

00:26:40
JILL S. HILL When I was in the sweat, I found that I could breathe and I could keep breathing. Certain people will come into your life and help you breathe one more breath and it's not just Indians. It's… It can be white people and black people, everyone. It's true and sometimes good in your heart. What's sad is that after I'd come out of the sweat, getting a Coke on my way home at a 7-11, I would again start thinking… thinking, that's… we're emphasizing that word, about how different I am from white people, a little judgmental. So Helms notes that the implicit information processing strategies that corresponds to this particular status are intellectualization and abstraction. There is almost an objectivity associated with this status and you can see how that might be evidenced here, right thinking part. Is there anymore to it though? Well, what's clear… what became clear to us as we discussed this and discussed all the interviews is that right here what… what Harshi is talking about occurs out of an intersubjective… intersubjective awareness. He realizes his intersubjective connections, so this intersubjectivity is like connections, relations with nature and other people. The emphasis on objectivity with regard to others nature may not be the best fit with the way that many native people view and experience the world or their lives. To emphasis this type of objectivity is… is very modernist, but may not resonate with how Indian people have historically arrived at awareness knowledge and wisdom. Once Harshi became involved at sweat ceremonies, his life and his perspectives changed dramatically. He claimed to see it as a space of no judgment. He argued that recognition and acceptance of people of all races and all living things were… were holy and they helps him breathe. In the lodge(ph) he disappears into his mother womb. His ego, which judges and sets itself apart from others and the world is diminished, so move on to the next stage. 

00:28:55
Integrative Awareness Status Capacity to value one’s own collective identities as well as empathize and collaborate with members of other oppressed groups; globally humanistic self-expression; flexible, complex (Helms, 1995, p.186) 

00:29:00
JILL S. HILL And this is… this is Helms’ last stage in her model, it’s integrative awareness status and it's the capacity to value one’s own collective identities as well as empathize and collaborate with members of other oppressed groups. There is a globally humanistic self-expression, more flexibility and complexity though too. 

00:29:15
"I started going to my first sweats when I was 18. I felt at home in my mother’s womb with the songs and the circle. There was no judgment there. Over the years of going to sun dance, I was gradually beginning to kill the warrior inside of me and I was happier…it was the way you treat all things, mitakuye oyacin, all my relations, everything. I began to see that I was related to all people and to the trees and grass. There was no hierarchy. I wasn’t above or below anything.” 

00:29:15
JILL S. HILL "I started going to my first sweats when I was 18. I felt at home in my mother’s womb with the songs and the circle. There was no judgment there. Over the years of going to sun dance, I was gradually beginning to kill the warrior inside of me and I was happier. It was the way you treat all things, mitakuye oyacin, all my relations, everything. I began to see that I was related to all people and to the trees and grass. There was no hierarchy. I wasn’t above or below anything.” So, this goes way beyond just connecting and collaborating with other groups or human beings. It’s connecting with the nature, the creator. It’s not about doing, it’s about being, a grounded being. For Indian people, it’s more about cognition and affect. It’s… It’s more than that I mean, it involves ones whole being, learning just to be. In order to reach this type of awareness, one must realize that he is not his opinions or his tribe or his anger, but he is much more that that. Here Harshi has a unitary experience of being itself and this is communicated through his use of mitakuye oyacin, a profound experience awareness of no dogma, no judgment, a centeredness in understanding just what it is to be related to everything. So, I talked a little about how when he enters the lodge, he enter his… his mother’s womb, right and his ego is diminished. So with its darkness, the chants, spirits, rocks, water, shoulder-to-shoulder people, heat, and prayers to (inaudible ), the sweat lodge allows this tiffany, this awareness, which is not merely a deep subjective realization, but an intersubjective experience which emerges within a historic traditional tribal symbolic space, sacred space. It’s also awareness that arrives out when Harshi is 18 years old, suggesting an age of emotional and cognitive maturity. 

00:31:30
“You learn stuff from children about spirituality sometimes. I was talking to this 11 year-old Comanche boy about prayers, how important it is to Indian people. We were sitting on a boulder in the mountains observing nature. After a few minutes of silently looking up at the clouds, I saw him point up and say, ‘Hawks…pray.’ I asked, ‘Do the Comanches pray when they see hawks?’ He said, ‘No, they’re just looking for prey.’ We broke up! Sometimes I get so spiritual I miss out on the obvious…The Spirit gives me a chance to laugh at myself and if I can’t, I can’t use my humanness to grow.” 

00:31:35
JILL S. HILL "You learn stuff from children about spirituality sometimes. I was talking to this 11-year-old Comanche boy about prayers, how important it is to Indian people. We were sitting on a boulder in the mountains observing nature. After a few minutes of silently looking up at the clouds, I saw him point up and say, “Hawks…pray.” I asked, “Do the Comanches pray when they see hawks? He said, “No, they’re just looking for prey.” We broke up! Sometimes I get so spiritual I miss out on the obvious. The Spirit gives me a chance to laugh at myself and if I can’t, I can’t use my humanness to grow.” So what might be unique and very important… a very important element represented here? 

00:32:15
[sil.] 

00:32:20
JILL S. HILL Yeah, humor, absolutely! So, we may be going along thinking we’re so enlightened, but humor humbles us and it makes us realize we have a lot more, we had to become unenlightened to become enlightened again, right? So in the interviews Harshi describes humor as old Indian trick medicine. His personal stories tell about being able to laugh at himself and one message said, no one, he in particular is able to direct spiritual energy. The child who spontaneously offers a practical interpretation is the spiritual energy, is in the spiritual energy more than a somber elder who might be trying too hard to experience it. He uses the vehicles of stories, humor, and sacrifice to illuminate his pathway to what we described as unitary awareness and state. Humor not… not only does it humble someone, but it is also spontaneous and uncontrollable. You can’t necessarily control humor it is not funny, right it is not humor, it’s forced. It prevents us from becoming self-satisfied and it shakes us from the comfort of certainty and allows us during to open to new forms of unitary awareness. So the unique elements here really are stories, humor and sacrifice. 

00:33:40
Preliminary Model Unitary Awareness Inter-subjectivity Subjectivity Fragmentation 

00:33:45
JILL S. HILL Some of us here if you can see this model very well. I’m… I’m about as good on PowerPoint as Rockey is which is you know, it must be genetic I don’t know, but might be. That might be another unique costume, right in PowerPoint? So this is our preliminary model. And some of the unique costumes we’ve discussed have included spirituality, historic trauma, and the necessity of living in two worlds, humor, stories, and sacrifice. So, we’re presenting this model, you can think of it as a process, one of healing to a trauma, one of decolonization or… and self-determination and one of spiritual development. One thing I just want to add is, as we started up here, this is the time before we needed to be healed and then we ran into anger fragmentation, fragmenting relationships, wanting to fit in. This is… This is close to the conformity stage actually of Helms model. Then we moved to subjectivity and we’re looking at pluralism, individuality. There is an inkling of… of freedom to breakout of bonds of the dominant culture, there’s still more anger and confusion and then we kind of move around to inter-subjectivity here. And we talk a lot about like this could be represented by the kind warrior even. Not… It's not unitary yet, haven’t arrived. We may have arrived at plurality and (inaudible ) multicultural values. But… And there are some interconnectedness. But… But then there is… again through these vehicles of sacrifice, humor stories, spirituality, spiritual traditions, we attain a unitary awareness. And this is a state, we don’t stay there, we can’t stay there. It’s… It’s really hard to anyway, but this is… So we kind of go in, I guess… I guess that’s counterclockwise fashion around there. So these are alternative statuses then that we present. And I will just talk briefly about the differences from other models. It’s different because it emphasizes so much more than just cognitive and/or emotional integration. It offers a different perspective one that’s not linear or progressive actually, but it’s circular and it emphasis being over action. I’ll make another point I… I’ll just repeat it actually. It doesn’t begin with the assumption of maladjustment, but rather it begins and really ends in the same place, one of blessing of the interconnections or relations that exist among all things and this is what we refer to as unitary awareness. What we offer as a model that’s more similar to the comic archetypal pattern, which emphasizes humor, the social over the individual as well as a circular pattern from innocence to unitary experience, that… that coming full circle. And that unitary awareness, it is not innocent, like we can’t be… we can't reclaim our innocence, but it is an awareness that has developed from experience. So obviously there are lot of limitations to a model, right? The… The first one is that it’s… it's limited to our interviews, which is one person from you know the southwestern, the Midwest of the United States. And because of that, certainly this model cannot encapsulate the dramatic differences among nations and we are not certain that this would generalize to people from different nations, okay. Secondly, it’s based on the experiences of young native American men, so it’s very gendered to cover the experiences of young men. So we don’t… Just because there are so many different developmental tasks that women have to go through, this probably wouldn’t apply to women as well. The other thing that limitation is that this model is just brands-baking news, so it will need to tested empirically which we hope to do. But right now it provides us as a starting point to ask better questions. You know when we talk about the purposes of racial cultural identity models and… and how they benefit us or how they benefit our work with our clients, it’s helping us to understand where a person might be in their… in their development as a racial/cultural human being, racial/cultural being, their sense of where they are with that. Because some people may not be ready to do certain things or talk about certain things or experience things that if they are in a, you know, talking a linear model if they are in a lower level stage or status. But up until this point we haven’t necessarily for American-Indian people we haven’t had a model that allows us to ask those questions more accurately and I think this is one of the strengths of this particular model and it brings in those unique costumes that we talked about that native people face and are faced with soon after they are born. I'm going to turn it over to Rockey to see if he has anything to add to what I have said. 

00:39:40
ROCKEY R. ROBBINS Just a couple of minutes I think before we open up the questions, it's almost 15 after now. But I think there is some unique things that this offers. You know, first of all it’s the implosion of the current model that's used by a lot of other people with different races of people that cultural racial people. So primarily it’s… what was said about doing it not to create a model necessarily, but to show how these models, the model, the must-use model that is can’t contain a real Indian person that it’s abstract. But it's useful, even you know the one that we have is useful already. But then once we put that real Indian person in there and started asking questions related to these things, we began to think, oh that’s a… that's very similar to a lot of Indian people we know, that comment that was made there, and some other ones in particular that really resonated. He tells about three or four hilarious stories about growing up and we thought, gosh, comedy, the comic, the comic archetypal pattern is more similar to Indian people than these other models, which are more romantic, romantic patterns. Because… Because… Because it start, you know, all comedies start off happy. If you got to any comedy ever do you ever see any comedy they start off in happiness, they move to a point where things go wrong usually by external forces in society and you run into these obstacles. Then the next things is they have to, it’s always a social thing. The person never wins out against the obstacles by themselves. Go to any comedy on movie and it's a social response and we call that resonates with Indian people and then at the end the… the ending like romance. A romance is… is a kind of marriage usually, a social kind of event. But then we also notice that as he talked there were a lots of several other things that were just didn't fit into their model either. You know, the emphasis is not only on humor, but this idea of a circle rather than a linear progression. Modernes… I mean, underlying all of science is this idea, you know that there is a progressive accumulation of knowledge that results in something wonderful and that’s a beautiful thing to say. But it definitely has epistemological underpinnings that don’t go with Indian people. I mean, everything is wonderful the way it is. It’s just that we can’t see it. I mean, the waters of eternal life are running past as right now, we just can’t see it and we were caught up in our egos and can’t even recognize that. So, we saw the spiritual aspect of it and so we thought, when kept telling about the beginning being a unitary experience and then it returns to the unitary experience and I thought, gosh we have got a circle. We don’t have a linear progression, we have a circle and the ending is not just about collaborating with other minorities or other groups and appreciating your American people, the end… the ending for him was about birds and trees. But not just about birds and trees, it was about realizing godhead, the eternal now. It was about the ground of being, it was being itself. I love that emphasis that was emphasized. It’s about being not doing. Now people who would be do a lot more than people who do, a lot more. Because they can act at a centeredness and they could remain in state of being even as they act in the world, because they are centered and they are not fighting against the stress and anxiety and all that other stuff, they act out of the centeredness, the being. And so we think we have something that really and surely implodes the models that we have to work with right now and Jill has just been, I believe I keep saying, sparks the fire out of her head as she begins to look at these things. It’s been bless to work with her on that. 

00:44:30
JILL S. HILL I’m not quite sure how to tell you how Dr. Helms developed her own model. I can tell you, I’ll tell you a little story though about my relationship to her model. When she… she actually presented that here at the Teacher’s College Winter Roundtable in 1994 and then she published it a year later. In 1994, I was a senior at Loyola College in Maryland and my mentor at the time was a former student of Dr. Helms, Donnie Cook and she was in the process of writing a book with Dr. Helms at that time and she introduced me to this model. And so I’ve been thinking about this model for a long time and have been wanting to… At first I… I guess, because there was nothing else out there I was pretty satisfied with it. You know for native people like this seems pretty encompassing, right? But over time you know… I write a lot about self-determination and decolonization within psychology for native people. And so this seemed like a natural extension of those interests, you know, why can’t we have our own model basically? So that’s… that’s kind of how I can talk about how my interest in this grew and of course Rockey, my collaboration with Rockey was just ongoing and so it seemed like a natural fit in that way. The one thing to keep in mind is that we don’t view this as… as reactionary to the dominant culture, that’s not what this model was about. It is much more internally validating. It is not seeking external validation in anyway actually it’s… it’s coming from within. I mean, as we were talking about actually we are writing this up. I said, you know, even just looking at that model and the dynamics within it, you can, I could hear a vibration, I could hear it like a drumbeat the whole time. It’s really more about how connected is that person to that drum over time. Does that mean anything to you? It’s always there and so it is more… that’s the internal part how connected is he in his development to that which is always there. 

00:46:55
ROCKEY R. ROBBINS Yeah that's good! Okay, if can just say the word to about it just a couple of things. One of them is that we do want to have empirical investigations about this, but one of the incredible things that I think that this might offer is that… that William Blake where you all universal things are found through particulars. And what we did is we picked out a particular individual and if we concentrate on that individual in a very through way with five interviews, somehow we find every human being in that one human being, because of the qualitative approach that we did. Now, is that enough for us? No. But what and to me is a great start and we found out by really focusing on that one individual we were able to implode the model so that it expanded it, so that we could look at it in other ways than the one that she just mentions is really beautiful, because… Have you ever read book by all that eyes on was it Nora. 

00:48:15
JILL S. GILL Our eyes were watching… 

00:48:15
ROCKEY R. ROBBINS What? 

00:48:15
JILL S. GILL Their eyes were watching… 

00:48:15
ROCKEY R. ROBBINS Their eyes were watching by 

00:48:15
JILL S. HILL God… Yeah. 

00:48:20
ROCKEY R. ROBBINS Okay, yeah! You remember the response she got from other African activists when she wrote that? I don’t remember it was a while ago. But she had a… They… You know people like James Bowen, they hated that book. You know why they hated it? It wasn’t angry enough. Because they were this would be really angry and you are supposed to be defying all these different kind of things. You remember what her response was? She said, “your identify is based on reacting to”, she said, “white people. My identity isn’t that. My identity emerges out of something deep inside of me and I don’t want to die having been defined by my reaction to white culture and white society.” It blew me away when I read that you know what I was trying to do? The same thing. It isn’t that we’re not angry and experienced righteous indignation about things are not fair and everything. But when I die I don’t to be an Indian who defines himself against those things that I don’t like. I want to emerge out of this deep inner… inner self that it is particular and everything. But we are going to do research. We want to do research on it and we came up… Did you notice that, it's more a spiritual sounding isn’t it? But have to, Indian people, we can’t keep from talking in spiritual terms, fragmentation, all of these are kind of spiritual terms that we came up to and it's really exciting to play with if anybody has any ideas, we… we came up with this within the last week. We had five solid days on this. I mean, it was unbelievable. So anybody wants that the only cool ideas, different ways of researching we are more than happy to hear it. But we think what the first person said I have tried to even trying to do something like this. We found one person, one little dissertation that kind of halfway did it. But nothing the way we have went about trying to do it. But we feel more scared to do it with Indian people, because of the vast number of tribes and it’s so hard. But don’t you think Helms… I mean I teach Helms model every year in multiculture, it's helpful. I mean, I think there’s something that you can get out of it even if it is not perfect and since (inaudible ) done with humor. Humor there is nothing better than exploiting self-satisfaction than humor and so we used that but… So we went into more research that we start up with a particular and we get depth from our first stab out of it. You know, Jill said it herself as I was sitting here just bingbowled over when she was taking about the whole idea of and see this is interesting liberal progress. The whole idea that we’re progressing toward an end that that’s what it's all about. You progress toward the end whereas this one we started off in a state of blessing that’s Jill’s language, a state of blessing. And you realize it again through your experiences, circularly back to that blessing. All of the models that we read start off in a negative state. We wondered if there has something to do with the original sin. I don’t know may be because western society, I mean this is not in my mind when I look at science I see a incredible reflection of confession Christianity in… in the way many people go about during any kind of research even. And so since we don’t believe in original sin, boy, we are part in nature and it's beautiful. So we start there and then we come back to that and so it's is nonlinear in that sense. Now, we do have individuality that is individuality along the way is the subjectivity. It’s the realization that the external influence is acting on upon us are not… are not meaningful. Even at the end of this circle you’ll only experience that in short instances. And I love the way she put it. Once you get enlightened you must be unlightened, because more experience has come along. And so then you get enlightened again, but you just keep going. We don’t know where the end is, but we have got it, it’s circular now, you know.
