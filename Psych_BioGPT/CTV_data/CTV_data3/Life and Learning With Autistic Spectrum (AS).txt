WENDY LAWSON It's quite exciting for me to have this amount of time with a group like this because, you know, when you present at a conference or something you might get 45 minutes. But, we've got, is it like 2 1/2 hours or something together? So that's really quite good, and if it's more than that you'll know. I kind of know when I'm supposed to start and finish. So we get to interact. And I, I really welcome your questions. If I'm saying something that you disagree with or isn't clear, please feel free to interrupt and just tell me so. Please also remember where we are when you interrupt so we can get back to that bit. I'm dependent on my, my data slideshow here to guide me through our time together, but, uh, I can get a bit sidetracked. Hopefully we won't, but I'll need you to remember where we are. The other thing I'd like to say is that, uh, I've been quite anxious recently about the media reports concerning autism. I don't know if you've been following the media. And the world media about autism is pretty scary. It promotes autism as something, in some newspapers, as being worse than cancer. I don't know what I have to say after that. That's pretty dramatic. That's talking about it as a tragedy. That's talking about it as the disease of the century. It's not disease. Autism is a developmental disposition, a delay in development in lots of ways. But, it's definitely not a disease. It certainly isn't worse than cancer. I mean, if you were one of the young people, child, teenager or an adult, living with autism and you read that about yourself, how would you feel? Good? No. Absolutely not. So, it's not doing her confidence or self-esteem much good, and it's inaccurate. Uh, so I think we really need to work hard at changing how the world views autism. I think one of the reasons this is happening is because agencies are trying to, to access funding which is absolutely necessary and helpful, and we do need funding and we do need resources. But , painting that's kind of a picture, uh, which is inaccurate for one thing, but it's also not useful or helpful. It also helps with, uh, interrupting human interaction. If people view me as somebody that's got a disease or somebody that's, uh, really bad, etc., then that's going to impact how they, how they work with me and how they relate to me. So, that's not useful at all. Everybody no matter what their disability, has a right to resources. That should be part and parcel of what we can expect. If you're somebody living with , uh, short sight or long sight, do expect to get glasses? Oh, good. Somebody does. Yes, absolutely. Do you feel like that's your right in our day and age in Australia? Yes, absolutely. What about if you're a left-handed person? Anybody remember the days when they used to make you write with your right hand? Yeah. Did that feel good? You mightn't got, you might've got used to it over time, but we don't do that these days do we? We accommodate being left-handed, and I think we should be accommodating autism and valuing the individuals who live with autism. We need to start off with that spot. We need to start off with acceptance. I'm not, I'm not saying, uh, that we should accept bad behavior or behavior that is inappropriate at all. Of course we shouldn't. We should be working with someone to enable them to choose to behave appropriately and differently. But that's true for everybody, isn't it, even typical people. Yeah. So, so I'm coming at autism from that viewpoint. I'm talking and sharing with you as a person who is autistic, and I have sons on the autistic spectrum. I'm a researcher, so this is what I do. This is my field, and, uh, I know this is only one story when I share mine with you, but the research that I'm sharing is much wider than just Wendy's story. So I'm hopeful that it will make sense, build some understanding, and, you know, build some good vibes, some positive stuff about autism. So what you can expect from this talk hopefully, an explanation of what might lead to the scripts, Pam used this term already, neurologically typical individuals have that inform their learning styles. And the reason I think that's a good place to kind of ground our time together in is because we understand what's going on for typical individuals I think we're more than likely to understand what's not going on for those of us who are autistic and what's going on for us who are autistic. So, it's, it's like, that's the kind of way of, of looking at it the differences. And I had one lady in a conference say to me, "Please, don't talk about autism as a difference, as a different learning style, as a different culture." She said, "If you do that, you're taking it out of the field of disability, and my son won't get funding." And I appreciate what she's trying to say, but I think that's misguided. Talking about a difference doesn't take something away from being a disability. When you think about people that are living on various disabilities, whether they have, I don't know, a visual impairment, a hearing impairment, uh, cerebral palsy, these sorts of things, do you think that they encounter their disability or feel disabled at home? What do you reckon? No, not really. If their home is all geared up for them and arranged and to set up so that they can live and function, then they don't notice. Home is where they can relax and be who they are. What about when they go into the outside world? You can often encounter it there. What if, what if shops are not at the right height for you to access? Buses, taxis, cars, subways, stairs, everywhere, if you're someone with cerebral palsy and you can't walk and you're dependent on a chair, a wheelchair, then you might feel your disability outside, especially when you're at this level and everybody else's appear. People want to take over and do things for you that you're quite comfortable and confident in doing yourself, because they, they feel the sense of I'm up here and you're down there, and I have to kind of support and help you, which is a nice feeling and it's good, but from the person who's in that chair, what does that do for your confidence and sense of feeling I can do this myself? Not a lot. Not a lot. So, I think it's the same with autism. I'm suggesting that in autism, I don't really feel autistic at home. I've got my computer, and I've got all my stuff geared up for me. But, I do notice it in the outside world. So does that make sense? Yeah. So, when I'm talking about autism as a different way of learning I'm not saying it's not a disability. I know I have a disability especially in the outside world where things are not really geared up for who I am. Said very definitely, uh, I would see that as not changing my disability. I just, just want to use these terms to help explain what's going on in autism. I ought to give a response to the idea that autism's spectrum, we sometimes call that AS for short, is a deviation from the norm and therefore is deviant and dysfunctional. Now, I don't believe autism is deviant and dysfunctional. I believe some people can be deviant and dysfunctional. Have you met any? Yeah, I've met several. They don't have to be autistic, do they? Thank you. Thank you. So, so to say that autism in itself is deviant, it doesn't fit in that bell shaped curve of average, so from that point of view it's deviant from the norm if you're taking that as your average. But which average are we using? If we take the population of those of us with autism than we fit right on in there and we belong. I fit in the bell shaped curve of autistic, which is a very wide spectrum of ability. And people move through that spectrum as they are growing up and getting older and learning and developing. Is that what happen's to typical people? Do you get older and learn and to develop? You all look like you grew up. Yeah, absolutely. So, yes there are some people who are deviant. They don't have to be autistic to fit that profile. But to say autism is, I think is a mistake. If we are going to treat autism like that, then that means we're going to treat the people like that. And, well, that's going to have all sorts of ripple on effects because autism, some people with autism have an intellectual disability, but that's probably 50 to 60 percent of our population. So, what about the other 30 to 40 percent of people with autism who don't have ID? Are they valuable? Absolutely. Are the people with intellectual disability valuable? Absolutely. All right, so I think it's really important that we understand that autism is a different learning style. It doesn't necessarily have to be deviant. I also want to present an alternative idea to the common explanations of autism. There are lots of theories about autism. Have you heard of theories like theory of mind? Yeah? Uh, theory of mind says that autism means we are not very good at, wait for it, mind reading. Who is willing to stand up as a typical individual and tell me they are really good at mind reading? Thank you. Hopefully, by the time we finish our time together you'll understand that you don't read minds, but you do read signs. The signs that typical people give out that you pick up on, and I know I often miss those. So I need to learn a different way. I might not be picking up on signs typically, but I can pick up on other signs that are presented to me non-typically if you like. And we'll, we'll explore that. So I think that the, uh, and there's lots of other research that'll take too long to go into to explain why I think theory of mind is really inappropriate when we look at autism. I think as a theory it has lots of holes in it. It says I don't have empathy. Well, that's not true. I often do. It might not come across in the same way as you if your typical. And if I haven't picked up on the signs, then it's hard to be empathetic. But once I actually pick up on the science, and I become aware, I can be very empathetic indeed. Uh, have you heard of the theory, it's called executive functioning or executive dysfunction. That's a theory about autism that says that our executive function, do you know what executive functions are? It's kind of what we think of as the higher-level functionings of organizing and planning, that kind of thing, yeah? You picture this kind of little business guy in your head in an office putting everything into files. That's what I do. That's your executive functions, putting everything into place, understanding about what's appropriate what comes first, next and that kind of thing. Well, they're saying that in autism that is disordered, and that that that accounts for the behavior we see. Yes, at the very core of my disability I have problems with being organized. Such problems that I try to really stay with a lot of structure to help me. I stay with routine. I stay with things that have my lists of things I have to do in a particular order and so on. And it can be very hard for me to get through, even in the everyday day, like this sort of day without that kind of structure. So if we took all your diaries away and all the ways of learning what to expect today, how would you feel? I mean some of you wouldn't mind. Some of you wouldn't like a diary, but do I hear lost? Yeah. Some of you would feel quite lost. So, I don't think we're alone in having problems with being organized. So I think there are some holes in that theory as well. I know I have greater problems, if you like, in these areas than typical people, but the theory itself doesn't explain enough. And another theory about autism says that, it's called central coherence theory. Have you heard of that one? It's a theory that says that in autism people fail to access the big picture. They're very good at being detailed focus. Have you heard that one? And on the surface that's probably closest theory to what I believe is going on in autism, but it still isn't enough because we're not focused on just any old details. We're only focused on the details that we are interested in. So, that theory has holes in it to. Uh, if you build all these so-called theories together, they build into a, a theory called theory of mind, uh, put them all together, oh nevermind. I lost that. I'll tell you in a minute. Oh, I know. Triad of impairments. Have you heard that? The triad? The triad is the most commonly thought of way of thinking about autism. It says autism means difficulties with social understanding, difficulties with communication, and difficulties with imagination or rigid thinking. Have you heard of that one? And the three theories that I mentioned before kind of overlap and broaden out into that wider concept. So one of the, well, three questions I quite like to ask people is, are these. Put your hand up if you don't have any problems with social understanding. The social world makes perfect sense to you. Thank you. Put your hand up if you don't have any problems at all with communication. All your departments talked each other. Husbands, wives, siblings, children, uh, blah blah blah. No problem at all with communication. The fact is that, was at 2.5 is a divorce rate? But anyway, thank you. Put your hand up if you don't have any problems at all with rigid thinking. You don't care what side of the bed you sleep on. Women drivers, what's that? You know, all these stereotypes we have. You're all very very kind. No hands. So, are you all then autistic? No, thank you. You don't look it, but not that you can tell by looking, can you? No. Okay, so to say that autism is a triad of impairments straight off like that, again doesn't really explain what autism is. It does tell me that I have more problems and more difficulties in those three areas than a typical person. That's why I have a diagnosis. I know I have more areas of difficulty or more problems in those three areas, but it still doesn't tell me why. So, I want to go way behind and beyond those typical theories that currently are being used to explain autism. Some of the concepts I'll be sharing with you, and we'll work on and build together, uh, are associated with attention and the interest system. 

00:17:50
Building on the work of others: The following concepts associated with attention and the interest system. Built upon the work by Murray(1992: 2001) and are illustrated in Murray, Lesser & Lawson, 2005). I also acknowledge themes located on the Internet by Autism Rights groups (e.g. www.autistics.org) 

00:17:50
WENDY LAWSON And, to key people in this area, working in this area, are Dr. Dinah Murray and Mike Lesser. And their work came out years and years ago, late 80s early 90s. So, I will refer to their work. You can also read about these things by visiting, uh, autistics.org. I don't know if you've ever gone on to their webpage, but it really is quite interesting. On their webpage they have, they have a triad of neuro-typical impairments. How about that them? It's really quite interesting to read. So, I need to acknowledge, uh, their work, and I will be building on what they've already talked about. 

00:18:30
Different? 

00:18:30
WENDY LAWSON Do you recognize these two? These two are actors. This is a snap moment in a film taken from the film "Rainman". It's quite an old film now. The gentleman in the darker colored coat in the film is playing the role of somebody who is typically development, neurologically typical, sometimes known as normal. Do I hear that, that was, that was a giggle, yeah. The gentleman in the lighter colored coat is acting the role of somebody who is autistically developing. When I look at these two I'm not sure which one I'm more worried about. He's a worry, Tom, isn't he? So maybe what we're talking about isn't deviation so much as it is difference. It still means I'm disabled, because the world is not set up for me. And that's, that's where I'm coming from. I'd like to read you this poem. This is something my mom has said about me. My mom is unofficially on the autistic spectrum. I'm convinced she has Aspurger's, but, uh, anyway, she'd wouldn't probably agree with me, but still. This is what she says. That's typical. That's typical I heard her say. I wondered what she meant? "You always want it your way" she echoed without relent. I waited, silent as a bird, and pondered on her words. She just kept talking. I kept walking. What was it that I heard. That's typical. "I always want it my way?" What other way could there be? I only know the proper way, the way that's there for me. If we do it her way it would be right at all. It would be wrong and all along, I'd know it's wrong and not okay. That's typical. So, why can't she understand? What is it she doesn't get? I must firmly stand my ground, I mustn't give in yet! If I give up shall never learn. She'll never know the way. She calls it "being stubborn", but I'm scripted for this play. 

00:20:55
That's typical! "That's typical" I heard her say, I wondered what she meant? "You always want it your way" She echoed without relent. I waited, silent as a bird, And pondered on her words. She just kept talking, I kept walking, What was it that I heard? 

00:20:55
That's typical "I always want it my way?" What other way could there be? I only know the proper way, The way that's there for me. If we do it her way, It wouldn't be right at all. It would be wrong and all along, I'd know what was wrong and not OK! 

00:20:55
That's typical. So, why can't she understand? What is it she doesn't get? I must firmly stand my ground, I mustn't give in yet! If I give up shall never learn. She'll never know the way. She calls it "being stubborn", But I'm scripted for this play. 

00:20:55
WENDY LAWSON Maybe there is a script that goes with typical development and with typical learning. Maybe there's a script that goes with autistic learning. Wherever you are on that autistic spectrum, you might have Asperger's. You might have, have you ever heard of PDD? Pervasive developmental disorder? That's part of the autistic spectrum. PDD NOS, heard of that one? Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified? That's horrible, hey. Imagine having that kind of diagnosis. And there's classic autism, Kantor(ph) type of autism, same thing. Autistic trays, autistic characteristics. They are all, all of those descriptions are describing somebody who's living on that autistic spectrum on some point or other. And sometimes, depending on who's assessing that person, uh, some days you'll get, you know, you might be more autistic than you are one day then another. So you might get a higher kind of level, and you might qualify for classic autism one day. If they were to test you the day before, you might get PDD. It's quite interesting. Do you feel like your mood and various things about you fluctuate day-to-day? Do you feel like you're for with it some days than others? So, you know what I'm saying then. It's quite difficult to make an accurate assessment. You know, kids can move around on the spectrum, teenagers and definitely adults as well. I'm saying that what's typical for me has got to do with how I learn. What's typical for you has got to do with how you learn. The package that you are today has been brought about by a number of things, hasn't it? You've grown up, uh, and the influences over your life would've been, what, your education, yeah? Your family, uh, culture, background, religion possibly, uh, gender. Gender is a huge factor, isn't it? Absolutely. So all those things have impacted on your life, but you wouldn't be who you are today without another factor and that is your own decisions. You made choices about things as you were growing up, didn't you? You reckon? I think you probably did. We all do. So, choice is a factor that's come into that as well. And who you are today is very much part of how you've taken on board your own choices. How you've integrated your understanding, your learning into your life. Have you heard of the different ways that people learn like some people are visual learners. Have you heard that? Yeah. Some people are kinesthetic learners. Did you know that one? Yup. Auditory learners? Yeah. Most of us are a combination of all three with a dominant, a dominance if you like, in one area over another. So you might predominantly visual, but you might be kinesthetic and auditory as well. Does that make sense? Close your eyes just for a few seconds. I'll give you a word to think about. Uh, I'd like you to think about the word home. 

00:24:30
[sil.] 

00:24:30
WENDY LAWSON Okay, open eyes. What did you see? 

00:24:45
UNKNOWN I saw my parents alive again. 

00:24:50
WENDY LAWSON Parents. 

00:24:50
UNKNOWN It made me cry. 

00:24:50
WENDY LAWSON Oh, I'm sorry. Parents alive again. I understand. My aunt, my favorite aunt died yesterday. It was very hard for me. I understand that. Yeah. 

00:25:05
UNKNOWN My daughters playing at a younger age. 

00:25:05
WENDY LAWSON Three daughters playing at a younger age. Went back in time. Okay, what else came to mind? Your dog. Oh, great. No, sometimes the pets get forgotten. Thank you. What else? Family. Anybody see a home that you're not in at the moment? Some of you did. Home in a different country? Okay. A home you'd like to have. No, right. Anybody see comfy? Happiness? Happiness is a child. Okay. I find this really fascinating because I asked you to think about the word home and then tell me what came to mind. I asked what did you see. How do you see happiness or comfy or safe? How do you see things like that? What are those states? Their feelings, aren't they, yeah. They are emotive states. So, what you were doing when you are thinking about just one word, you are on a bit of a journey really. It's almost like that word was a kind of stepping stone or a springboard for you, wasn't it. It set you off on course. It wasn't a flat experience. This was really quite emotive. I really didn't mean to upset anybody. But, it is quite interesting that one word can trigger not just thinking, but it also triggers feeling. So what's that's telling us about your, your learning style do you reckon? It's telling us it's quite complex, isn't it. It's telling me that your brain is configured to work with the ability to shift focus. Focus on one word can send you back in time or forward in time. It can connect thinking to feeling even, and that's a particular disposition that we find in neuro-typical population. Uh, did anybody actually do what I asked and just think of the word? H-O-M-E. Yeah. So, did you think of the word? Yeah. Did you see, this is a bit hard, but did you see the word home or just hear the request I'd given you? Okay. 

00:28:00
AUDIENCE I'd seen the word home (inaudible) 

00:28:05
WENDY LAWSON Okay. You saw the word home and then it disappeared. Yeah. What you experienced is much more common amongst those of us with autism. It's the sort of thing that happens to me. When I was first asked to do this little test, strange as it may seem, I actually saw my home address on an envelope. That was it. Nothing else. Or it was a stamp. Yours was the actual word. Yeah, the word home. And, uh, at a conference, we were at a conference in Sweden. We had about 80 young people on the spectrum of autism. And they saw things like just the word or home address, uh, didn't go any further than that. One lad saw a microwave, and one saw a fridge. But, it was close to lunchtime. But nobody in the autistic population at that particular conference, 80 young people, so statistically there should've been somebody, uh, thinking in that realm. Nobody saw the safe or comfy or it wasn't emotive in any way. Hey. 

00:29:20
UNKNOWN I saw the two homes where I grew up as a child in space. It was odd. 

00:29:25
WENDY LAWSON Yeah. Grew up in plenty of space. It's just a train. Does that mean it's gone or coming or going? Still coming, is it? I might have to just breathe in and breathe out. So if we are thinking space, that still requires the shifting of attention or focus. And it still requires a connection to a, a wonder concept than just a word. It gave you a feeling hopefully a positive one. So, it's very interesting this kind of exercise. It also tells me a little about your learning style. If you are visual, you're more likely to picture a kitchen with the washing up in, the kids, the dog, the garden. You're more likely to visually kind of track yourself through your home, room to room. If you're auditory, you're more likely to hear associations with home. You're more likely to get even carried into that emotive state through a kind of listening. You might, you might hear conversations. You might hear the TV. You know, those are the sorts of things that will happen. If your kinesthetic learner, you'll be on the move. You'll be going, you'll be hopping about in all sorts of ways from various aspects of what home means for you. As I said before, most of us are all those put together with one dominant over another. If you're on the autistic spectrum, you might be a bit like me and, uh, just see a word or an address or something that's pertaining to home, but it doesn't take you any further. It's just literally the word home. And, uh, I'm not actually a visual learner. I think in pictures, but they are pictures formed by words. I'm a much more auditory. Will this will have all sorts of implications for how you learn and for how I learn. And I'm quite anxious again about this because one of the other things that's being very widely promoted in working with those of us with autism is the need for visual: visual timetables, visual structure, which might be absolutely spot on for a number of young people on the spectrum. But some of us, if we're kinesthetic for example, we might need to have some squishy ball in our hand to learn. If the teacher takes that away, then I'm switched off. And the teacher might be thinking or a parent might be thinking I need him or her to put that down so that they listen to me, so that they focus. But actually, jumping on a trampoline or having something in my hand or playing with something might mean I've got more attention available than if you stop me if I'm a kinesthetic learner. A bit like, have you come across people who, who kind of doodle in lectures and things. You know, they, or they're on the phone and they draw on their pad next to the telephone. They, if you stop them, if you take the pen away and say, "Hands down." then they can't concentrate so well on listening to the phone conversation. It's the same kind of thing. In autism some of our young people aren't only visual. They may need to be twiddling or walking or moving. And, and that can be disruptive if you've got persons always walking around the classroom or they're at home and you'd asked them to lay the table. And you know, they've got a knife on there and they're gone. Or they might not even, they've got half the sentence and they're gone. And we've got to find creative ways of occupying that moving space while still allowing them to actually absorb the instruction and being able to do what it is we've asked. Like, I've got all sorts of ideas. You can e-mail me. And I can send you those because that's not actually part of our talk. But, it is important that we profile if you're working as a teacher with the child. If you're a parent, that you get to know what is that makes up that young person's learning style. What do they need? If you provide them with a whole load of pictures and they tear them up or they don't associate the picture with the real saying. You know, I don't want a picture of the drink. I want the drink. Tear up the picture. Then you have to go back a step and think now what is their learning style? What are they connecting? What are they believing or perceiving about what I'm trying to do? It's ever so important we profile the young people. We get what we call a kind of baseline or a foundation of understanding about how they learn. Because trying to teach somebody in a way that isn't to their natural way of learning is really difficult. It's an uphill battle. And if all you feel is that your constantly pushing this barrel uphill and it's taking all your energy. I mean, how long are you going to last? How long are they going to last? You're going to fall out at some point and that'll get hard. So, it's really important. All right. 

00:34:35
Deviation or Difference? It is common to fear what one doesn't understand. Fear causes us to hide, run, criticize, ostracized and/or attempt to make the fear go away (see de Gelder et Al. 2004). Society's attempts at inclusion for all, is posing some problems because we fear what we don't understand and what this means we often fear each other. 

00:34:35
WENDY LAWSON Deviation or difference is a kind of question that I've woven all the way through our workshop, and we'll come across it quite a lot. I think if we understand that difference doesn't mean necessarily deviant and that you can be normal and absolutely deviant, then we're onto a good thing. I think it's also very common to fear what we don't understand. Fear causes us to hide, run, criticize, ostracize. Sometimes we even attempt to make that fear go away. And, agencies that are being set up like Cure Autism Now, for example, are absolutely without realizing it using fear, uh, in I don't think in a healthy or helpful way. I don't want to be cured. I need assistance. I want the support to exist as myself. Isn't that what you want? Yeah. I reckon. That's what we all want. That's what we all need. If I can be developing and learning as the individual I am to my best potential, and that's different for everybody, then I reckon that's, that's, that equals the playing field. That should be everybody's human right. I really believe that. If I'm being troubled by indigestion problems or physical ailments or if I have an immune, you know, an immune disposition that needs attention, if I'm living with headaches or all sorts of those things need to be looked at and explored, don't they. Wouldn't you want yours looked at? Absolutely. So that's where cure comes in. We need to be curing, uh, dispositions which are causing us all sorts of hassles and problems. Absolutely. I don't want to be, I'm not free to learn if I feel crook. Are you? No, absolutely. But that's a completely different phenomenon. It goes alongside to being human. People get sick. People develop all sorts of, uh, conditions, and we need all sorts of support for that. That's a different to talking about autism. If we're thinking of autism as a developmental disposition. And that's what the, even though the manual, it's called the DSM. I don't know if you've heard of the DSM, but it's a manual for mental disabilities. It has all sorts of things including dyslexia and dyspraxia, uh, are in there. Those sorts of things. So even in there autism is under that heading, pervasive developmental disorders, dispositions. Delay is used. That's a word that comes across a lot as well. Delay is not the same as cancellation, is it? So don't write us off. I reckon if you understand you'll be less likely to fear. Society's attempts at inclusion, and that's a buzzword that's been around a long time now, for all is posing some problems because we fear that we don't understand, and this means we often fear each other. I was walking down the high street Warrnambool just a couple of days ago. I don't usually shop on my own. I don't usually travel on my own, but sometimes Beatrice will be in one shop, and she'll say, "Just go into there and do this." And she'll give me a list. Or you know, sometimes situations present themselves. And I know that this is an okay thing. I can do that bit. As I was walking down the road, there were a group of youths, of young men. Have you come across them before? Yeah. And they just looked scary. I mean they were, I don't know, 17 or 18. I crossed over the road. It's hard for me to admit that, but I did. I didn't feel safe. So I understand about fear. Have you ever felt that kind of thing, have you ever felt not quite comfortable with somebody? I don't think it's uncommon. Were we once teenagers? So we ought to understand them, didn't we? We won't go into that one. But, uh, it is difficult. To be inclusive is posing problems. The biggest problem is fear. The way we combat fear is to try to make everybody the same. Let's take all these square pegs and make them fit in these round holes. You will fit. I've had teachers and people say to me, "Well, you know, the world's a tough place, and you've just got to learn." Well, he won't just learn. That isn't how it works. Would you say to somebody that's in a wheelchair, "Look, you know, most of us walk, so get over it." We wouldn't, would we? If somebody was visually impaired would we say, "I'm really sorry you're having problems seeing, but we live in a cited world. Get used to it." No, we don't do that. We provide to braille, a white cane, a seeing-eye dog. We arrange the furniture so that people don't walk into things. We organize the world to make learning accessible for them. That's what we have to do for autism too. I really believe that. 

00:39:45
Typical and ASD development To understand ASD must first look at the typical development - Typical children divide their attention to accommodate the changing world around and within themselves (physical, emotional and social world). 

00:39:45
WENDY LAWSON Typical and ASD development. I think, as I said earlier, to understand autism we need to understand typical development as a, uh, way of exploring what autism is. To understand ASD we must first look at typical development. What we know about typical kids is that they divide their attention to accommodate the changing world around and within themselves. That's the physical, emotional and social world. Have you ever gone for a walk with a little person? You know, three-year-old? Gone up a Lane, uh, to a shopping center, to a zoo, anything like that? Yeah. When you're walking with a three-year-old, do you hold their hand? You might, hey. Do you talk to them? Yeah. Oh good. That's very good. When you talk to a three-year-old, do you point things out that you might notice? Yeah. I remember walking with my little people when my kids were small. And I'd say things like, "Look at the digger." This is in a lane in England. In the field actually. "Look at the digger. Look at the tractor. Look at the train. Look at the plane. Look at the gigi.” English for horse. And the kids, as small as they were, accommodated all those different ideas, entities. They were all very different things. A plane is not like a train. I know there are some similarities. It carries people. It's got engines. But, they're not really like to look at, are they. What about a horse? Look like a digger? No, not really. I don't think so. So for a child to appreciate all those different things they have to shift focus. They have to move from attending to the digger, to the tractor, to the train and plane and horse, and appreciate all those differing concepts. And take them all on board and share them with me, etc. Kids do that with you? Typical, ordinary little children. I mean, you're talking about things. And then they share from their perspective with you too. Share things with you about what they've been doing and bring home drawings from school and you put them on the fridge. There's blobs of nothingness. Isn't that lovely, dear. Yeah. That's good. It's very good. 

00:42:15
Typical development doing certain things at certain times. We call these 'mile stones'. Shared attention (follows direction of adult's gaze/finger-pointing etc.) Language (develops words uses them appropriately) Shared interests (turn taking, listening to others, understanding other points of view etc.) Social priorities (social norms, morality, social conscience, being social a priority) 

00:42:15
WENDY LAWSON Typical development means doing certain things at certain times. We call these milestones. Do we? Yeah, sort of, I think. We've got, at the end of my street in Warrnambool there's this, uh, concrete kind of stone thing. And etched in black on the stone it says, "Belfast 10 miles". What do you reckon? I used to think, "Oh, yeah? I don't think so. Belfast is in Ireland, eh?" Well I didn't know until somebody told me, I think it might've been in Bendigo(ph) last time I was here, was that a town 10 miles down from where I live, uh, that's now called Port Ferry, used to be called Belfast. Okay? And in the old days, they used to talk to miles and not kilometers. So, so that's what it was. But that's a milestone. It's a stone or pointer, just letting people know about what you can expect to come down the road. We use that term to explain what we expect of kids development. We expect roughly around six months they'll set up. We expect at, who knows, seven or eight months they'll be possibly crawling and bottom shuffling and things. We expect to that at 12, 14 months they'll be walking. Do we not? These are expectations, and that's what we think of as milestones. All right. Sharing attention is one of those milestones in kids development. Uh, have you ever pointed something, and said, "Look. What's that over there?" Have you ever done that? What happens if you stand in the street, and you look up like this? You soon have a group of people all trying to show that they're doing the same. It's funny, isn't it. So if we point to something, people somehow perceive that we mean that they have to look over there. Sharing gaze or direction waypoint to something is part of typical development. And kids, 14, 15, 16 definitely by 18 months have got this. Do you understand off Pat? Not off Harry or Dick. They've got it. They've learned it. Some of the kids do. They develop language. They use single words and string them together. Make sentences and talk appropriately until what age? Until they go to school. I think we used to say teenagers, didn't we? A bit younger now, isn't it? All right. Sharing interests, taking turns, listening to others, understanding other people have different points of view that aren't always agreeable two years. All of that is part and parcel of growing up. It's milestones that kids grow through as they grow up. If you put those things together, it builds into a concept that we call social priorities. Social priorities are something typical people do a lot of. It's to do with letting go of your own needs to accommodate somebody else's. It's a priority to be socially available. I mean, why would you want to have people come to a birthday party? Are you telling me that's fun? Are you telling me kids actually like that? Do they? Apparently. Absolutely. From facepainting and having all that interaction, yelling and screaming and balloons. A nightmare, but they love it, don't they? Typical kids, not all. I'm sure some don't, but it's part and parcel in seemingly being comfortable in that social environment. Social priorities. I can give you some examples. Have you ever been at a supermarket, for example, finished all your shopping and all you want to do is get home, cook tea or check your e-mails or important things like that. And you see somebody coming, and they're going to chat and hold you up. And they've seen you seeing them. So, there's nowhere to go. You can't hide behind your trolley, and you can't disappear up that Lane. How are you feeling? You're probably thinking and feeling, "Oh, no." But as they get closer to you, what you say? "Hi. Hello. Yeah. "Nice to see you." Who said that? "Nice to see you." It's the last thing you're feeling, but it might be what you say. So that's an example, isn't it. Of letting go of your own needs to accommodate somebody else. What about, uh, if somebody gives you a present? Somebody might say to you, "I've got, I've got your birthday present with me." When they say that to you, how do you feel? Uncomfortable. You're supposed to say excited. Oh, you didn't give them one. Oh, you're beating me to it. All right. Oh no, I didn't, I forgot to their birthday, oh no. All right. Well, put that to one side for the moment. Yeah, let's just go for the excited. At least they thought about you and how nice. That'll do? Yeah. And then you open it. And you realize you've got seven of these already. Or, if they really knew me there's no way they'd buy me that. So what are you feeling now? Disappointment. Glad you didn't buy them one, eh? So, if you're feeling disappointed, and you've moved from feeling "Oh, lovely" to disappointed, what are you going to say to the person that gives you the present? Gee, this person says, "Oh wow." That's lovely. So, you're feeling disappointed, but you smile and say, "That's lovely." Why do you do that? Don't offend them. You want to accommodate them. You care about their feelings. They put all that effort in. If they got it wrong, they had to go. Yeah. That's another example of a social priority if you like. Another one might be if you finish work. Can you pretend you're an office worker for a minute? All right. If you're an office worker, and you finished up, and you've locked your door and you walking out. And you're about to go home. You're already running late. You understand running late? Strange expression. You're meant to have left, but you haven't quite yet. And then Joe comes out of their office, and they've got this package under their arm, and they say, "Ben, just the person I want to see." So by them saying, pointing at you and saying, "Just the person I want to see", package under the arm, what do you conclude? They, they want you to probably go back to their office and to do a bit more work. Yeah. So, you, what you do is you turn your back on them and pretend not to see them and keep going. No? Probably not. What are you going to do probably? You'll probably say, "Hi. All right then. What is it?" Something like that, reluctantly. But you're more likely to say something of that nature. If you're really really desperate as it's an emergency, he might say, "Sorry, mate. Can't stop. I'll take care of that tomorrow." But, either way you'll find a way that isn't turning your back on them and pretending you didn't see them. Either way you'll find a way to accommodate that person so they feel okay. And those are examples of social priorities. But, to do all of those things you have to have a learning style or a brain that's configured to work with attention or focus that can shift from self to other, from now until then or now to ahead. You need to have a brain that works with this facility of attention. You also have to have a brain that's connected to an interest system or a system of interests that facilitates the shifting of attention. So that means, when I'm talking about a system of interest, it isn't just hobbies. Is that all right? It's not just a good hobby or a bad hobby or something like that. It's anything that puts you into a state of arousal or understanding. Yup, does that make sense? So, if for example, if your bladder's full and you really need to the loo, how are you feeling? Uncomfortable. You're feeling like your bladder's full and you need the loo. All right. Now, Wendy we wish you hadn't mentioned that actually. Okay. So that's what, that'll occupy if it's really full, that'll occupy your interest, won't it? Have you ever had a stone in your shoe? And you walking with a mate and you're having a deep conversation. How attentive are you to the conversation? Where's your attention? Stone on the shoe. What is it you want to do? Take the stone out. Yeah? Absolutely. Can you negotiate that? Can you negotiate being with the mate, having this deep and meaningful conversation and finding the right moment to take the stone out of your shoe and then get back to the conversation? Yeah. You probably could. So if attention is a, is a scarce resource and we've only got so much to go around, is it a renewable resource? Yeah. You can kind of gather yourself up and go back in there and attend to things again. So, if you've got interest, interest over here. And you've got attention here. And these two are working together, then that's going to mean you're able to accommodate a much wider understanding than if you were somebody who had a very minimal or singly focused interest. Do you reckon? I'll explain this in more detail. Absolutely. 

00:52:40
What informs typical development? Nature and nurture (genes and upbringing) inform development. Cognitively, however, the ability to divide one's attention is critical to NT development. Having a diffuse/diverse interest system and being able to access multiple interests (one's own and others) relies upon the innate ability to divide one's attention and build connections. 

00:52:40
WENDY LAWSON What informs typical development? Well, nature and nurture, genes and upbringing. You know what I mean by genes? Not Levi's or anything. Informs development. Cognitively, so what's going on in your head. And we use the word cognitive. It's a word used for processing, thinking, decision-making, problem-solving. That's what cognitively means. All those things that are going on, you know, in your head. The ability to divide your attention, I believe, is absolutely critical to typical development. If you are a typically developing person, then that, the way your brain is configured to interact with the world that you're part of, what it focuses on, what it's interested in and how those tWo work together with your senses. That's going to be your learning style will be informed by those things. If you are not able to divide attention, then you won't be typically developing. You'll have a diffuse and diverse interest system. So that means you've got lots of things you're interested in. If you're really interested, say you're watching tennis on telly. Wimbledon's on or something. You're watching tennis like this. And you are, this is the final. And the person that, that you're hoping for is just going to go in for their last kind of fling, and it's matchpoint, and it's really crucial. And if someone comes in and speaks to you. How are you feeling? Yeah? You want to thump them? Do you actually hear them when they speak to you if you're really focused? Some of you wouldn't even hear them. What if they called, "Mom." Have you read that joke in the paper where the husband is locked outside, and it's three o'clock in the morning. And he says, "Mom.", because he's tried "Helen, Helen." Everybody hears "Mom" if your mom, don't you? Even if you're not the mom of that kid did you hear "mom". It's fascinating. So, you will tend to hear your name or disposition like mom even if you don't hear other things because your brain, even when you are intensely focused, your brain is configured to switch between the two or three. You can divide attention. You mightn't like it. You might be really angry, and you might do your utmost to close out, but you probably can shift focus even when you're intent on something else. If somebody, if you were really into a good book, you know. You're really getting right to the point now, it's a crunch, and you're getting to the end of the book. And there's no way you're going to be interrupted. And someone says, "Fire." All right, you just, you know it's not for real. But, you know, you'd probably hear that. There are certain things like your name and things like fire, putting your safety at risk that you will hear no matter what. But what about if you're autistic? It might be different, eh? You might not hear your name. You might not hear "fire". Our intentions and our interests can be so focused it can actually knock out anything else. So it's definitely different than how we are learning. You're able to access multiple interests your own and other people's, but this relies upon that innate abilities divide attention and to build connections. And building connections is the key to what's going on in typical development. Typically you are building connections all the time, just like you did when you closed your eyes and thought of that word "home". You connected. It wasn't a flat experience. You connected emotively. You connected all sorts of aspects of your home life because you have that ability. 

00:56:35
ASD Developing individuals Because children with ASD are not typically developing, they and the typical world are confused by one another 

00:56:35
WENDY LAWSON ASD developing individuals, I reckon, because children with ASD, and when I use that term "ASD", autism spectrum disorder in the textbook. Wendy's thinking of autism spectrum diffability(ph), being differently abled. I think that's much more appropriate. The word disorder conjures up all sorts of negative stuff which I don't think is helpful. So ASD from my perspective, without taking it out of the field of disability, autism spectrum diffability. Being differently able, which is a disability because the world isn't accommodating my diffability. Because children with ASD are not typically development, they and the typical world are confused by one another. It's very confusing having a mind set or being with another person that's a sort of different mindset to you. It's difficult. You know, I can't, I can't, I find it really hard to understand how somebody could not like cheese and marmalade on toast. It's one of my favorite things. I love it. How could you not like it? I find it very difficult to, to appreciate somebody could like things like pickles. I have a friend who'll eat a whole jar, just nothing else. Just pickles. Now that's, you know, very difficult to understand. But because I understand and I am at home with certain things about me, it's hard to actually accommodate or place that understanding onto other people. So for example, well they must like it, I like it. I'll bet everybody in this room loves Star Trek. No. How could you not? But it's true, Wendy. Not everybody does. People have different views, different likes, etc. But when you're out shopping for some like, a present for somebody else, do you try to put yourself in their shoes and think about what they would like or do you look at something and, "That's lovely. They'll love that" because you love it. Do you know what I'm talking about? Who do you go by? What they like or what you think you would like or? You try to think about what they would like. So you buy them something they would like even if you couldn't stand it. I reckon. That's what I've come to understand by, I've been studying typical populations for many years now. You are an interesting breed. You're very very, uh, yeah, interesting is my best word to describe you. I, you don't always make a lot of sense, but you're interesting. That's important isn't it? Because you want to please them. But I still reckon a bit of what you do is colored by what you think you would like because it's still hard even though you can divide attention, even though you can put yourself in their shoes, it still hard for you isn't it, to think how could somebody not like that? I have, you know, one member of my family keeps on, "But you will like avocado. Taste it." I don't like it. "No wait. You haven't given it a fair go." Yes, I have. I don't like it. "Well, maybe we need to kind of mix it, you know, vinegar and." I don't like it. Isn't it funny. It's so hard is it to get yourself into that position. If you like something, somebody else will have to. So, it's difficult. And it is difficult for you, so imagine how difficult it would be for those of us with autism who are absolutely black and white, who are absolutely literal. Everything about us is almost alien when you look at the typically developing kids. We don't want to be sociable a lot of the time. Or if we do we're not sure how to go about it. There's also hurts of aspects to our behaviors which are so, so different to what you see in typical kids. So that the best thing that we can do is to, well I don't think it's the best thing, but a lot of people think the best thing we can do is try to make them more typical. Is that right? I don't think that's the answer. It's not working, folks. 

01:00:40
Attention & Learning learning requires attention, interest and the interplay between senses and cognition. With respect to attention and interest, NT and ASD individuals are wired differently. But, is this deviation or simply an aspect of rural by diversity? 

01:00:40
WENDY LAWSON It's sending us the wrong message. Attention and learning. Do you think learning requires attention? Do you learn better when you attended to things? Yeah. Do you learn better when you attend and can connect to meaning? Absolutely. That's the bottom line. If there's meaning for it for you you're much more likely to retain what you learn. Learning requires attention. It requires this interplay between interest and senses. So what are your senses? Sight, hearing, taste, touch, smell. Yeah. Yeah. Yup. And maybe intuition? Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. Intuition is a sense you have as well. And you put all those together and I reckon, it's not just Wendy reckons, I mean it's pretty obvious really, but your senses are your first port of call for any information, aren't they? You smell something unless you like Wendy and you've got a bit of cold today. You smell something, touch something, taste something. It tells you, gives you information about to the thing you are seeing. So what happens if you put a blindfold on you and tell you because you can't see, but tell you that there are two flowers in front of you. This one that you're feeling over here is a carnation. And this one over here is, I don't know, maybe it's a daisy or something. You've got an image? But the perfume we waft on, across were around or through or under your nose is a rose. What do you smell? Anybody know? You're much more likely, how much spelled as a daisy have? Not really. What about a carnation? It's a nice good one. You're much more likely, if I tell you that what you're feeling is a carnation, but you don't see it, you're much more likely to smell a carnation and did not rose. Why is that do you reckon? Yeah, your brain and your senses are all talking to each other, aren't they? They're interacting with each other. Is that right? If you're all plugged up and can't smell anything, how does your food taste? It's kind of bland, isn't it. See, if you're typically developing , your senses are all talking to each other. They're all, they're all connected. You don't see and then here and then taste and then touch. All of that happens at the same time. So, it's not difficult if you're typically developing to look and listen at the same time. People talk about eye contact, which is a really funny expression. It makes me think of eye on eye, you know, contact. They don't mean that. They mean that, that you are looking in their direction towards their eyes and face. So, you can look and listen and walk and think and talk all at the same time. Yeah? I honestly find this quite amazing. I find that absolutely fascinating, all the sorts of things you can do. For me, for Wendy and for many of us on the spectrum it's very very difficult to look at the same time as listening. I can look if I'm talking, because I'm not really set focusing so much. Or I can look at you if I know you, I've had time to work your face out. I've already got a kind of understanding. It's very difficult. It's not that hard for you guys, so, so that you think I'm looking at you, I've learned to look in your general direction. Usually at your eyebrows, because poor things, you get quite upset if you don't feel like we're looking at you, don't you? That's very hard for you. Be careful, Wendy, you'll get thumped any minute. So with respect to attention and interest, I'm suggesting that NT, short for neurologically typical, typical, normal, that kind of thing, and ASD, short for autism, uh, individuals are actually wired up differently. I'm, I'm suggesting that our heads are configured, our brains are configured differently. So if you looked at my brain, I'd have to be dead for you to do that, you know that don't you? Unless it was some kind of, you know, MRI or image. But our brain structures are in the same place. We've got left hemispheres and right hemispheres and limbic systems and everything just like everybody else, but how they are working in talking to each other, how the brain is configured within those structures I reckon is different if you're on the autistic spectrum. And you can't see this, but I'm suggesting this is why I have a disability, because the way I'm configured isn't typical. So the way I behave, the way I think, the way I process isn't typical either. And if you try to teach me typically I won't learn very well because I'm not built that way. It's like trying to make somebody who's left-handed write with their right hand. It's really uncomfortable, and it doesn't suit me, and you know, I might get there eventually but a lot of dramas and it's not necessary. But is this a deviation or simply an aspect of neural diversity? And I'm suggesting that it's neural diversity that we're working with. And you will have people who are deviant, but I don't believe autism is on its own. It's a different thing. And I'm saying it's part of neural diversity because if you say, if someone's brain is configured differently than that's not normal then we've got a problem. Because we know, don't we, that male and female brains are quite different. So if you're going to take one of those as your standard for norm, it means the other isn't normal. So, who are you going to vote for? Males or females? They're configured very differently. Male brains are much smaller than female brains. Eh? Are they normal? All right. We want to go into that too much. Absolutely, of course they are. They're just configured to differently. Males and females, absolutely. The man know who are the normal ones of course. 

01:07:00
Attention & Learning In ASD single attention (monotropism) requires one's senses to work more independently than they might together. In NT development integrated sensory function is primary to typical growth and development (Bogdashina, 2003). Therefore, in NT development the interest System is informed by 'divided attention' (Polytropism). 

01:07:00
WENDY LAWSON Anyway, attention and learning. I'm suggesting that if we are configured to differently then we need to give that configuration name. We need to identify and label that difference so that we can accommodate it. I've had people say to me, "we don't like labels, Wendy. We don't want to put labels on things. Labeling isn't useful." Well, if we took you into your pantry and showed you'd all the cans and tins of goods in there without labels, how would you know which ones were baked beans and which ones were catfood? Eh labels are misused but it doesn't mean they're not useful. So if we can use this as a tag or a way of identifying simply systems so that we can accommodate learning then it's very useful. Single attention in autism is called monotropism, and some of you have probably heard this before. And this is the label that I reckon belongs to autism. Being Mono means being single focused, single-minded, one thing at one time. Tropism is a term for channels. So you could think of your senses as channels for information. But, in autism our senses even tend to work one at a time. We don't work with an integrated sensory system like typical people do. That means possibly one of my senses or whoever the autistic person is, one of their senses might be more dominant than another. That might be visual. It might not. Have you seen, have you seen, uh, people with autism do this? Kind of walk on their toes? Toe walking? Yeah. Well, if you're dominant sense was tactile or touch, and that was, that was the sense you took all the information of the world in through, if your feet are flat on the ground like that, flat on the ground, that's a lot of information coming up through your feet. So to diminish information you go up like that. Yeah? Then you've got less information overwhelming your one sense which is trying to deal with everything. You toe walk. It might mean you're tactile defensive and you can't bear to be touched. Or if you are touched, it has to be firm. You can't bear clothes on. If clothes are on you they have to be tight, this kind of thing. That tells me shoes, shoes are off. I already put my shoes off. And if they're on, they've got to be tight. My shoes have to be very very firm for me. I know other people that are not likely at all, because they are, their sense, their dominant sense isn't tactile. They have a different sense. Auditory, fingers in ears, hands over ears. You so much as come in the room, my hands are over my ears and you haven't even spoken to me yet. That tells me something about that person's sensory issue. It has to do with an overwhelming sense that's coming in through their ears. And then you have visual sense. You know, you have people who look out the side of their eye or they have to look at the world through their fingers. I used to do that a lot as a kid. Just, just have a go with me. Just humor me. Put your hands up front of your eyes. And just, as you're looking at the world open and close your fingers. It chunks the world. So we do it quite fast. Isn't that lovely? You know, if all the world is coming at you at once, how better, what a useful thing to do to stop it, but just let in little bits. And if you do it like this quite fast then you can try and at least keep up with what's going on around you without walking into something. It actually cuts it into manageable pieces for me. I don't do this anymore. I've got Irlen lenses. My Irlen lenses for me I find really helpful. They help me not walk into things. They help me, the print on the computer and in books stay still. I used to, the floor used to wave up under me as I walked. Now it stays still. I would be, I would find my life so much harder without my Irlen lenses. This particular color I've been assessed for and works for me. My youngest son had a kind of purple, slightly deeper purple color in his lenses. And my brother, he has a really rich bottle green that suit him. Different colors suit different people. And not all of them suit anybody. Some people don't get on with Irlen lenses at all. But, I find them really really useful. So I don't need to do this anymore because I've got these. But that might be something you'll see an autism. And if someone is doing this and we don't find an alternative way for them to handle the world, but we just say, "hands down, stop out, not now. Just do that in your room when you're on your own" or any of those sorts of things what are we doing to that person do you think? We're actually stopping the world from being accessible to them, aren't we? So, why are we doing it? Why do we say, "Don't do this." It's because it looks odd, eh? It's not what we think of as of the norm. But if we don't provide an alternative for them, we're leaving them lost in a world without signposts. In the desert without signposts. And they've got nowhere to go. And rather than decreasing stress, what happens? It increases it. So what's the likelihood of some kind of behavior and them spiraling out of control and you might get a bit of aggression. It increases it. So it's really important to understand about sensory profiling, to understand what is a person's dominant sense, what we can do about it if this is what's happening in autism for that person. If you are monotropic, it will also have impact on emotions. I might be completely taken up by one thing that actually is so occupying my interest system that I, I'm not able to show some emotive state towards some other event. For example, my friend in WA, uh, her little girl, JessIe, tripped down some steps onto concrete. She was only two years old. I was sitting in the corner reading my book as you do, right. This two-year-old was screaming and bleeding, and it looked a mess actually. And was calling, "mom, mom", but in a two-year-old voice. Yeah? So, I kept reading my book, right? Right? No. You're not supposed to, are you. No. Her mom eventually came running in and said to Wendy, "Jessie's hurt herself." I said, "Yeah, she's bleeding too. Looks a bit of a mess." And she said, "Why are you sitting there?" I said, "I'm reading the book." She said, "But but how come you haven't gone over to see what's happening for Jessie?" And I said, "She's not calling me. She's calling mom. She doesn't want me." And my friend said, "Wendy, it wouldn't matter. This is a little person. She's only two. She's hurt herself. You're the adult. You should've got to her to see what's going on." I couldn't process any of that fast enough. Jessie wasn't calling me, so literally I understood she wants mom not Wendy, so I won't get involved. And the other thing was because of all my attention and interest focus on my book, I didn't connect with what was happening for Jessie. Does that make me insensitive? It makes me appear, but I'm not actually insensitive. Once I had understood and had been told what was going on, now I know in future any two-year-old falls down, put your book down. You go over and you check on them. I've got it, I've got it now. I've got it off Pat. I'm not insensitive actually, but if all my emotion is here it's like there's not available to be there. And it's hard to explain this. This is very much the disability in autism, because it means I'm not typical. In NT development, integrated sensory function is primary. So that means if you're a typical person all your senses are integrated, talking to each other, and that's very much part of being a typical person. Olga Bogdashina has some books that write about sensory issues and autism. And she has quite a useful, uh, questionnaire in the back of her book that shows you how you can profile or workup an understanding, work out and understanding on what's happening in sensory issues for a person who's on the spectrum. Uh, in typical development, because your interest system is informed by divided attention, you can shift focus. Your interests are wide and diffuse and diverse. We call that polytropism. So that's your label if you like. Sometimes I refer to people who were typically developing as pollies. Nothing to do with parrots, although you could be forgiven for thinking so I reckon. Be careful, Wendy. All right. 

01:16:40
NT's often fear (AS) us because We don't fit the typical developmental paradigm. We don't usually have multiple diffuse interests and are not governed by an interest system allowing for theatrical imagination feeding to social priorities. Rather, AS individuals tended toward single interests and nonsocial priorities. 

01:16:40
WENDY LAWSON So NT's often fear us because we don't fit the typical developmental paradigm. We don't usually have multiply diffuse interests and are not government by an interest system that allows for theatrical imagination which leads to that social prioritizing. Hey, you know what? You know how good you are at pretending? Could you pretend that this pen has lights? You probably could. Wendy's pen. It actually says Jury's Inn(ph) on their in Cork. But, it's Wendy's now. They leave pens in the hotels for you, don't they? Why would they put it there otherwise? Wendy's pen. Yeah? Choo-choo-choo what is it now? ? 

01:17:25
AUDIENCE A train. 

01:17:30
WENDY LAWSON Pardon? 

01:17:35
AUDIENCE It's still a pen. 

01:17:35
WENDY LAWSON Thank you. Right, it's still a pen. What you were doing was pretending that it might be a train. Yeah? I hope you were. Okay. If you are a typically developing individual, and you've got a head that's configured to divide attention and shift focus, and all your senses are talking to each other. And you're a polytropic person, you will be able to use your imagination to take you into all sorts of things like you did when you thought about that word home even. You imagined all sorts of things connected to home. The word imagination if you look this up in the dictionary says "bringing into being something that is not". Does that make sense? Bringing into being something that is not. So by imagining my pen as a train you were bringing that train into this picture here and now. Is that right? Pretending. Okay. I find this very very difficult. Now, I can imagine writing with my pen at some later date. Am I writing with it now? No. So if I imagine writing with my pen later is that still imagination? It is, absolutely, because I'm not doing it now. And we all agreed I think that the term imagination means bringing into being something that is not. It's not here and now, but we can pretend it as if it were. So that's still imagination. So do I have an imagination? Yeah. But is it different do you think to a typical imagination? It might well be. I'm not into trains. Really. But I do have a sort of, I love anything to do with space, uh, Star Trek, Deep Space 9, uh, Star Wars. You know those sorts of science fiction movies and things. Who's into Dr. Who? Don't answer that. Oh wow, lots of hands going up. So, although I'm not good at imagining a train, I could imagine a rocket if I had lights on my pen, it makes more sense. I'm, I'm pretty good. I can imagine a rocket because that's already within my interest system. And this is what we see in autism. Not good with theatrical imagination. Theatrical is the sort of imagination that puts on a bit of a show, uh, that other kids can join in and be an audience to and so on, and it develops a very very young in typical kids. I mightn't be so good at that. That's fantasy-based, and it's fantasy across lots of different interests. But, if you use my interest, my fantasy if you like, is actually part of my real interest or my real world. I really do write with my pen, and I really am interested in science fiction movies. Does that make sense? So if we know that an autism, a child or a teenager or an adult, is going to be monotropic. If this is where they are at, then we need to use their probably one interest to help them learn across varying domains. For some kids that might be Thomas the tank engine. Sorry to do this to you. You all thought you'd get rid of Thomas, didn't you? It might be dinosaurs. It might be the solar system. It might be, you know, the drainage system beneath my house. There's all sorts of things that people have an interest in. And if we take that interest, not away, but we take it on board we can, when you've got interest what else have you got? It begins with "M". Motivation. You use a young person's interest, you've got to the motivated. You'll be opening doors to learning. Learning about a whole heap of things. If you don't use interest, remembering all of my attention is in one place, how might going to attend to something that I'm not interested in. You can. Give Wendy a birthday present, not so much these days, but when I was younger if I didn't like it I would've said, "You're joking, right? What do I want that for?" I don't do that now. But, I would've done it at one point in time. Being honest, being literal, being black and white is very much one of our traits. We don't mean to be insensitive. We just say it like it is. Okay? So if you know that I'm single-minded, if you know that I'm going to have a dominant interest, it makes sense to use that interest. Now, some people say to me, "We don't know what his or her interest is, Wendy." Maybe they are too young and they're kind of all over the place. Three and four-year-olds are a bit like that. They haven't settled to anyone interest yet. Maybe the interest has been so knocked out of them that they are now teenagers and they don't have any interest left. Or maybe they're hiding in their rooms on their computers all day, sleeping all day rather and on their computers all night when nobody else is around. You know, maybe they have an intellectual disability as well as autism. And that's harder to locate an interest. I can think of one young man, 23 years old now. His main interest in all the world was the sound of breaking glass. Breaking crockery, he loves it. He's ever so excited every time he breaks a window. Do you want to live with him then? No. We uploaded the sound of breaking glass, breaking crockery to a computer. The data presentation I'm using to work through this workshop with you together is so accessible for so many people. You can put sounds, pictures. You can change backgrounds. You can use Thomas the Tank Engine or dinosaurs or a pointer. You know, you can do so much on a computer. This young man has an intellectual disability. He doesn't talk. He can't even dress himself. But, he loves the sound of breaking crockery. He can flop his hands on the keyboard and hear that sound. He gets very excited. So do we. Our windows are safe. So, even though some of the interest some of the young people have are bizarre, there's a way to use them. I have a friend in the UK who loves spit bubbles. Morning tea with her anybody? She builds these wonderful mountains of spit on her coffee table at home. I can't get into spit myself. Can't do that. But, what I can do to join her interest and to join her as a human being is find a way to relate. I can use Paintshop Pro on my laptop or any other, uh, you know, software that comes with Windows or with the Mac, and I can draw these wonderful raindrop type spit bubble shapes. No texture, no ickiness. Just lovely patterns that she and I can share together. So, I'm suggesting that whatever the interest, if you're working with a monotropic individual, you need to use monotropic practices to reach them and relate and to build understanding. If you don't, it's so hard for us to kind of follow what you're on about. We've got just a little bit longer. This is an illustration of what I'm trying to explain. These two trees, uh, the one on your right is meant to represent typical development. You could think of the foliage as your brain if you like. And the trunk is your life, and your life is the whole tree. The swirly bits going up the trunk and through the foliage are meant to represent attention. I'll use my hands. If, if you imagine, maybe can you imagine my hands as a attention cake. This is a cake. How imaginative are you? Cake? Feeling hungry? You're not allowed to eat my hands, all right? Attention cake. Now, I'm feeling really generous, and I want to share my cake with you. So I'm going to divide my cake in two. I'll have one half. You can have the other. How's that? So, by dividing my cake have I made more cake? Say no. Same amount. But, by dividing my cake, will it go further? Yeah. Absolutely. It will because I get some and so do you. It's the same cake. Same cake. If I have it all, it doesn't go any further than me. If I share it, I divide it, you get some and I get some. So, it goes further because it goes to you and me. So, it's the same cake. It's no more. No more, no less. But, you get some and so do I because we divided it. So, it's the same amount. Absolutely. But, it's shared. Does that make sense? All right. That's what's happening in typical development when people divide attention. You're actually able to access more of an understanding, a wider picture. It's like operating on that wide beam of the torch. Whereas in autism we tended to operate on a narrower beam. We are focused. We're on task. I find it really hard to think if someone is talking to me. At Uni, I couldn't, I couldn't write notes and listen to a lecture. Okay? I had to do one or the other, not both. So, I had a note taker at Uni. That was provisioned for me. When I got to exam time, I did all my exams in my living room. Well, initially I didn't because they didn't really realize, so I had to take an exam in a room with other people. And that was really difficult. I couldn't. There was no way I could. I failed because of all the movements. The clicking of pens and chairs and people's clothes and hairs make noise, don't they? Too difficult. So eventually it I got exams of my living room and home, and an individual came and sat there. She brought a book. Three-hour exam. And I said to her, "You're not going to read that book, are you?" She said, "I did intend to, Wendy, yes." I said, "Well, there's no way I can focus if you turn pages." Because everything's heightened, you know. It's just one of her. That's what had to happen for me because of my monotropic disposition. One thing at one time. It doesn't mean I'm not bright. It doesn't mean I can't think and focus or study and work. I can, but I need particular, uh, circumstances to make learning accessible for me. And we need to do this for our young people on the autistic spectrum. We need to organize our classrooms, our family life. And I know it's different and it's difficult to have schedules and to have things planned and to let us know, but it really is much better. Not just for us, it will be better for you to. And you need to let us know in a way that allows for change. Please don't say lunch is at 12 and dish up at five past. I'll miss lunch. You need to say lunch is at lunchtime. Yeah? So, there's a way of building a schedule, a way of building structure which doesn't set it in concrete. Its structure, but it's the sort of structure that allows for things to be different. It's very important in autism otherwise you get yourself into a bit of a pickle. Do you understand that? So, if you're dividing attention and you see the word "other" written into the foliage of that tree? When you divide something, it doesn't matter what it is, anything. So, imagine this is that cake of attention. If I divided, what's in the middle? Nothing. Space. If you divide something you get this space. If this is going on in your life, you've got a place for other. Other ideas, other thoughts, other ways to do something, alternatives, uh, other as an individual, embodiment of other, other anything is available. It doesn't mean you necessarily take it on board, but it's available Because of how your brain is configured. In autism, the tree on your left, how much space is there in the foliage of that tree? There isn't any, is there? What's it chockablock with? Interest. So, in autism our one interest, whatever that is at the moment, will occupy all of our attention. And if you ride on the back of that interest, you're more likely to go to guide me into what it is you want me to do, think, understand, comprehend, etc. If you try to take me away from that interest, how many other interests have I got? None. So, you'll take away my motivation, and it's not the right way to work with me at all. So, I'm suggesting, uh, and after lunch I'll show you how this pans out as least in my life. But I'm suggesting we need to work with the facility of single attention in autism. I'm suggesting that autism means monotropic attention. The words I use for this are called SAACA. Well, that's the acronym. SAACA stands for "single attention and associated cognition in autism". But, I'll show you how this pans out after lunch.

Part 2 

01:31:50
WENDY LAWSON All right, getting back to where we were. I said that, uh, I'd like to talk to you about using my family life or my life growing up as a way of exploring the things we'd actually talked about. So, uh, if I start by pointing out the photo. The picture there. Wendy's in the dark colored coat, and my sister Allie is in the lighter colored coat. Allie is three years old and Wendy is four. I think by looking at this picture you can tell that neither of these kids are particularly comfortable. 

01:32:35
Wendy & Autism: As a small child: Considered to be intellectually disabled. Went to mainstream schools. Loved to run freely around the playground classroom. Unaware of 'others'. Not connected to the world going on within me or around me 

01:32:35
WENDY LAWSON So Allie is very aware of Wendy even though she's only three. What about Wendy? Is Wendy aware of Allie? What do you reckon? No. She's not aware of Allie at all. Can you think of some reasons for her discomfort? 

01:32:50
AUDIENCE Proximity to... 

01:32:55
WENDY LAWSON Yeah, Wendy's discomfort might be be because she's being made to stand there, and she's too close to her sister and that sort of thing. So, proximity stuff. Could be. 

01:33:05
AUDIENCE Aversion to photographs. 

01:33:10
WENDY LAWSON It could be that she's got an aversion to photographs. It's sort of like something you're not expecting out of your day. It's not something that happens all the time. 

01:33:20
AUDIENCE The dog. 

01:33:20
WENDY LAWSON It could be that she doesn't like dogs, because you know, dogs do sudden things. You don't quite know. They are really unpredictable, and a lot of kids who are autistic have a problem with dogs. I'll tell you the reason for the discomfort that I remember. I'm wearing a lovely kind of, uh, olive green corduroy jacket with, with a velvety caller that you can rub against your face and suck and do nice things with. Allie is wearing a very prickly synthetic outfit. And that's the reason for my discomfort. Standing next to that outfit was really uncomfortable because I have sensory issues with clothes. That would be hard for you to pick, but what you did pick, what you noticed, was the discomfort of both kids. And it would be quite likely, uh, that that discomfort from Allie's perspective is because she knows what's wrong with Wendy. Wendy's not, well she knows Wendy's not happy. And she's already interpreted that. She's a person who divides her attention, and she accommodates the bigger picture so she's already noting, uh, what's happening. She's already beginning to be worried about that, what that will ripple out to. It might mean that shall be, uh, attacked by me and all that kind of stuff. Wendy isn't noticing Allie. Wendy is only noticing there's that prickly outfit. So, it's a very different use of attention. Does that make sense? So it's quite hard to explain, but that's a very different use of attention. I had a diagnosis at this age of intellectual disability. I'm not intellectually disabled I don't think, but even on my most recent IQ score in, you know, I had to do some testing recently, and my IQ, uh, had gone up. It wasn't below 70 anymore. But it's now about 80. 82. So that's still considered to be at the lower end of average. I'm doing a PhD. What do you reckon? Is it, is it likely to be accurate? No. IQ tests are sorts of assessment tools that we use are often not really written for kids that were autistic. So they are often a bit difficult to be, uh, to be accurate. What we can gain from IQ testing is that very un-even profile of ability. And that's sort of the pattern you see in autism. So, a young person can be really really good at this thing over here but mightn't be so good at tying shoelaces. Be great at programming a computer, but mightn't be so good as to realizing they need to open the door because you're standing to get through as well. Wendy went to ordinary mainstream schools with Allie. I didn't go to special schools. I really don't know why. They sent me to school when I was five. I lasted a day. They kept me home for another year. I tried again when I was six. I was always escaping as you do, going fishing, trying other things rather than being at school. School was very difficult for me. 

01:36:30
Primary School Found school very confusing. Didn't understand 'the rules'. Didn't relate to other children. Didn't like the games or the social activities. Slow to read. Couldn't keep up with the expected pace of learning. 

01:36:30
WENDY LAWSON But at school, for example, if Allie was running in the corridor and a teacher noticed her, a teacher might say, "Stop running in the corridor". Allie would stop running until she was around the corner where she knew the teacher couldn't see her anymore. So again, that's that division of attention, being able to suss out the fact that I'm not on the view and I can get away with stuff. That is very much part of typical development. It's a very useful part of typical development. It can help keep you safe in situations, you know, etc. But that's the sort of skill I didn't have. I was told to stop running at school. I'd never run again at that particular school ever anywhere at that school, whether you were watching or no. I took that quite literally. Wendy wasn't connected to the world going on within her or without. So I didn't know the state of my bladder. I didn't know if I was hot or cold. I didn't know if I was hungry or full. And if I wanted something, if there was some sparkly object that was capturing my attention, and you happen to be standing between that object and me, tough. 

01:37:40
Family life Unaware of siblings. Scared of sudden noise. Scared of thunderstorms... But intrigued by them. Loved to play in the garden with the gravel. Loved the seaside. 

01:37:40
WENDY LAWSON You got kind of moved out of the way or walked into. I got the object, and then you might say to me, "That was rude." Of course, that makes no connection. There's no connection to your statement. I had what I was after, and that's where my attention is. So when you say, "That was rude" or "Don't be naughty." Or "What do you think you're doing?" Well, it was obvious, I was getting this object actually. My understanding from your words is different to yours. And this is all got to do with how I'm using attention and how that simply, uh, has affected my interest and so on. Family life. I was unaware of my siblings. I should rephrase that really. I was unaware if they were there. If they weren't there then I noticed, if that makes any sense at all. Scared of sudden noise. Allie would note and notice and understand and accommodate that understanding if mom got the vacuum cleaner out. Wendy was scared every time she got it out. Allie could hone in on noise and know that's just a car, that's just an airplane, whatever. Every noise for me would make me jump. I never, for years and years and years I never actually fitted the noise to, to the object and worked out what it meant. And therefore I could release myself from fear from it. 

01:39:05
Diet Ate only specific and favoured foods. Quite limited diet and very particular. Made eating out or with others very difficult because I ate at certain times, in certain places, from certain crockery and only specific food items e.g. Potatoes, baked beans, cheese, bananas & apples. 

01:39:05
WENDY LAWSON Wendy's diet. Now this is interesting, not so much because actually I think this is quite a varied diet, but it's not the contents of the diet that I find interesting. It's how my diet is experienced in boxes. So what I ate at home I didn't eat at school. What I ate at school I didn't eat at home. Now that's of interest to me. Allie, if she was eating Vegemite sandwiches at home, she'd eat Vegemite sandwiches at school. Yeah? But Wendy didn't operate like that. I had things, this is what you did on Monday. This is what you did at school. This is what you did at home. This person was allowed there. This person wasn't. All those kinds of boxed separated rules are result of single attention. Allie's attention isn't single. It's, it's divided. It's mixing and matching. It's sorting stuff out. It's working her brain. Her brain is working so differently to mine. 

01:40:05
Sleeping I was always a poor sleeper. I found it difficult to get off to sleep. I also found it difficult to stay asleep. If I manage 4 hours sleep at night without disturbance, I'm doing well! 

01:40:05
WENDY LAWSON Sleeping is another issue. Have you heard the latest research currently in August, 2007 concerning sleep? Do you know, you might, you might know that sleep is very difficult for some people to actually catch up with if they are sleep deprived. Have you heard that? You might have heard that people need about eight hours sleep. Yeah. What they've now found, again in connection with the brain, uh, that the brain is a brilliant, fantastic organ. What they found is that there are types of brain with regard to sleep. So some people like Allie have the kind of sleep patterns and profiles we find in rodents. They need to sleep quite deeply, quite long. It takes them a while to come out of that sleep. If you deprive them of sleep and you give them things to do, uh, they don't do work very well. And if you give them a good sleep and then give them tasks to do they still don't do that well. Sleep deprivation really affects them. Yeah? The other type of brain with regards to sleep they are finding is in dolphins. Dolphins, dolphins nap. Like a cat nap in dolphin language. Do you know what I mean? So they don't sleep very deeply, and they sleep lightly, and they wake quickly, and they don't seem to need to be in a sort of sleepy state for very long to have had enough sleep to still be able to do things they do. Allie was definitely a member of the rat race. She is absolutely, she gets really ratty when she's tired. Wendy is a member of the dolphin race. Now that doesn't mean that all autistics are like Wendy. There are kids who really do need sleep, uh, and they just don't know how to access it. Mom would come into our bedroom, and she would say, "Get to sleep." And I remember saying, "Yeah. A nap would be good. Directions would be nice. How do you get there?" You know, people give out these sweeping statements, but don't give you the information to make that happen. Now if Allie had had a lot of activity during the day, she didn't need any more information. If she was knackered, she would sleep. It doesn't seem to happen for Wendy. Does that make sense? So if I'm a person that doesn't need much sleep, putting me to sleep early and keeping me there forever isn't helpful. But you might need sleep as parents, and you might want me to stay in my room. So my son Tim was a bit like me. He didn't need much sleep either, which was great when we were all up at five in the morning, all outside collecting bugs and shiny leaves, you know. But, uh, as he got a bit older, he got more, it got harder because sister Katie does need sleep. So we had rules about yes, the light beyond in your room. Yes, you can listen to your radio through your headphones only. You're not allowed to disturb your sister and your other brothers. You know, yes, there's this bananas there, and there's something for you to eat or drink during the night. You're not allowed out of the room until at least five, etc. But that's about probably the best you can do. I'm sorry to lay that on you, but it might be that the young person you have who is autistic might be like Wendy and might not need a great deal of sleep. And if they are like Allie, then they're going to need sleep, and you might need to investigate the sort of sleep hygiene program. So that might mean things like no fluids after three o'clock. I tend not to drink tea after three, although they are saying that tea isn't really, it's a diuretic, but it doesn't necessarily. It has similar amount of caffeine as coffee, but it doesn't necessarily keep you awake because it has other ingredients that counteract, counteract the caffeine. But definitely not coffee for Wendy after three would be good. I'm not allowed to watch CSI and that kind of thing. So I do my best. I try to write things down before going to bed so that they are not in my head to keep going on and around and around and thinking about. 

01:44:15
Teenage Years Began to recognize that I was different. Beginnings of despair. Started to form over attachments Obsessive behaviours increased. Sent off to the Guides and Youth Group. Obsessed about earning badges, but couldn't form friendships. Age 17 yrs. first attempted suicide. Beginning of history with the mental health system! 

01:44:15
WENDY LAWSON Teenage years. For Wendy, and I reckon if this is true for me then it's probably true for lots of others, but it was as a teenager, an older teenager, I'm talking 16, 17 when I began to realize I was different. As in there were less people like Wendy and more people like Allie in the world. Does that make sense? So there's a lot of kids out there who are autistic who I reckon know they're different. But if you're going to say things like, "Well, when do I tell him or her that they have autism? When do I tell them they're different?" Maybe that's not really the right way of thinking about it. Highlighting my difference makes me more aware of my disability, if you like. Makes me more aware that I'm not able to fit in, and that could be the trigger for depression especially in teenage years. So what I did to my son Tim, we focused on his sister. My daughter is the NT member of our family, although even that she's query lately. She said, "Mom, I'm counting the sheets of the loo roll I've used. Do you think I'm autistic?" "No, darling. It takes more than counting the sheets of the loo roll to qualify for autism. Sorry." Anyway, so I'd say, "You know, you know, Tim, what Katie does? You know how she watches those programs like "Neighbors"? Yeah? And, uh, and you know how she wears different clothes every day? And you know how she likes variety? And she doesn't even always like the same food? It's remarkable. And you know how long she takes in the bathroom? And you know..." I go on a bit, but I paint this picture of Katie's behavior. I say to Tim, "That's because she's NT. She can't help it. It's the way she's designed. It's the way she's designed. And what she's actually doing is he's shifting her attention all the time. She doesn't stay with one thing very long. She gets bored so she, she just keeps moving off. It's just the way she's put together. But Tim, you and your mom, probably your dad and brother and cousins etc. etc., we are ASD. And we are, we like the same thing. We watch the best programs like CSI. And, uh, and we wear the same clothes, you know. We like to sit in the same chair and eat the same food. And, uh, we're just put together differently. We're really good at focusing, mate, and when we start something and that's our interest, you know, we run with it. And it's our interest forever, eh? And that's because we are ASD." So that's way of explaining, it almost makes, it doesn't mean that Timmy's the odd one out. Does that make sense? It doesn't, it doesn't make him, it doesn't highlight his disability so much as it does their difference, global difference. And I think that's the better way to go. For Wendy, my parents did all sorts of things to help me. They thought they were helping me try to cope. They send me to groups. Groups and autism might not go well together. They thought that if I went to Guides and Youth Group that I'd, I'd kind of learn to make friends. Do you know about all those lovely social skills that teenagers have? Not? Do you know? Well, I learned, I learned how to swear. I did that really well. I learned some outrageous things. Teenagers kind of model really well. But, I certainly didn't learn how to make friends. That was the thing that my family were wanting me to learn. So, because all this failed so miserably, yes, at 17 I attempted suicide. I attempted suicide several times. I didn't succeed and I was like, "Ah, even that I can't get right." I'm happy now that I didn't succeed, and I discovered that I've got, there's a reason for me to be. But I certainly didn't know that then, and that was the beginning of for Wendy of a very long history with, with mental illness and with the mental health situation. Well, if you get into mental health as a person with the diagnosis, and mine was schizophrenia at 17, it's very hard to actually query or get anyone to listen to you. I said to my psychiatrist, "I don't think I'm schizophrenic." And he said, "Wendy, schizophrenics don't think they are schizophrenic." It was very difficult, very difficult. And he took, took this long history from my mom. Mom said, "Oh, Wendy, uh, she lives in a world of her own. Uh, she doesn't relate emotively to things that are happening for us. She gets overwhelmed very quickly. Etc." he's writing all this down. And then the psychiatrist, and I know some of you will know this, but the psychiatrist said to Wendy, "Do you hear voices?" 

01:49:25
[sil.] 

01:49:25
WENDY LAWSON Now I remember thinking, "Silly man." And then he said, uh, so you agree with me, right? Voices were designed to be heard. And then he said, "Wendy, do you see things?" "Yes, especially with my glasses on." I said, "Yes, I do." He said, "Well, the voices you hear, what do these voices say to you?" And I said to him, "Well, it depends on whose voice it is." So then he said, "Oh, you hear more than one?" I'm getting myself deeper and deeper and deeper into a situation there was no way back from. Now, if you're a person who lives detached from reality, and you have auditory and visual hallucinations, you tend to get a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Yeah. I'm not schizophrenic, but I can understand sort of how they could've gotten that wrong. You know, psychiatrists have like one the lecture on autism. They're not the most qualified people really to look at diagnosis. We need a team of people, don't we, to make a proper assessment. Anyway, because of that diagnosis I was put into a mental institution and onto lots of antipsychotic medication. I had 25 years on antipsychotic medication. I was in and out of mental institutions for 25 years of my life. And it just, it nearly killed me. To survive that and to come out the other end to me as a real miracle. It probably only happened because I had the psychiatrist who did listen. And, he read one of Donna's books that I was reading at the time. And I said to him, "whatever is happening for her is happening to me." And, uh, I only got my autism diagnosed at the age of 42. So, we don't, yeah, I don't think kids should have to go through all that kind of thing. And kids are misdiagnosed all the time with ADHD and personality disorders and social phobias, all sorts of things. And some of that might be right. It's really important that we listen and take this on board and get things done correctly so that we can help them change. 

01:51:40
Delayed developments primary school: detached Secondary School: over attached. School was a nightmare and I lived with constant fear. This led to my having an "upset tummy" fairly often. 

01:51:40
WENDY LAWSON So, primary school Wendy was detached, lived in a world of her own if you like. Secondary school, I was always over attached to other kids. There isn't a lot of literature about this, but if it happened to me it's probably happening to other kids too. It was like I attached to a child who seemed to know their way around so that I could know my way around. I lived my life through them. If they weren't there, neither was I. Again, very difficult to explain. But you know things that might be helpful would be things like color coding, visual timetables, a way of explaining what I can expect to happen. And then I wouldn't need to format kind of obsessive tendency to another person. So, school was a nightmare. I lived in constant fear. This led to me having upset tummies fairly often. It led to all sorts of discomforts. 

01:52:35
Emotions Most of my life I feel like an onlooker. Difficulty defining which emotion I'm feeling. OK with clearly defined emotions (happy, angry, sad) but the difficulties occur with the 'in-between' emotions E.g. frustration. Either excited or enthusiastic... A bit wearing on other people 

01:52:35
WENDY LAWSON Talking about emotions. Some people think that if you're autistic you haven't got emotions, which is weird because do you think interest is an emotion? Please say yes. Interest is an emotive state, it's a state of arousal. What about fear? Absolutely. I have all the same emotions as you. Knowing when, where and how to use them is difficult for me. I sometimes say to people, "Is this a good time to laugh?" "Do you think I should do this? Or what about that?" I'm not really quite as good perhaps as you guys at understanding what should happen where when and how, but I certainly have emotions. It's a little bit like watching a video that's going on in front of me. Life is playing out like a video. So I'm watching it all, but I'm slightly detached. And it's a lot harder to, to connect with what's going on. And also I, I have a kind of synesthesia thing happening, which is the color that goes with an emotive state. So, as I look out over something, if I'm feeling comfortable and happy there's almost a yellow glow. If I'm feeling angry, it's brown. Frustrated is gray. So I work quite a lot with colors. And that's not a common autistic theme. It's a Wendy theme. But, maybe it's happening for other young people too. And maybe there are reasons why we don't like particular colors or patterns. And we might need to check, check that out a bit more. I'm okay with clearly defined emotions. The in between emotions are a bit difficult sometimes. I have a lady from Autism Victoria, this is years and years ago working with me to help me understand emotions. And she did things like draw smiley faces for happy. An upside down moon sad face for not happy. I was traveling from Melbourne. I was getting a tram and then the train to go back to where I had to live. And on the tram I looked at all the people. Nobody wore a smile on their face. And the lady next to me wasn't smiling. And I said to her, "What, what would it take to make you smile?" She thumped me. She hit me, and she got up and moved, which was quite hard because it was a very crowded tram. I thought, "I've probably done something wrong. What is it?" It was hard to work out. When I related this back to the person at Autism Vic, it became obvious that you have to be really careful when you're trying to teach emotions if you're going to use visual illustrations, because people sometimes don't smile but they are okay. Did you know that? And sometimes people smile when they are sad. Did you know that? Yeah. So, just suggesting that emotive states are represented outwardly mightn't be enough. Because then you you've got a kid that may be checking in all the time with you if you're not smiling. Are you happy, mom? Are you all right? Which is the sort of thing which I was constantly doing. It's very wearing on people, is it not. But, it's telling me that I don't have a concept for the emotive states of others. We use things like, uh, temperature gauge, which you can draw. On an A4 sheet of paper, you can draw different colors like the temperature gauge, and you can have lines that represent different levels of emotive states. And you can have a little, little piece that's attached like with Velcro that you move up and down to signify where somebody's at, how they're feeling, you know, between ten and one, with one being really happy and ten being sad. Where do you fit? Do you know what I'm saying? That kind of thing? A visual way of looking. It doesn't mean they have to go to everybody and ask them, "Are you a one today?" So, you've got to be very careful especially if you're using pictures for example. Using pictures to teach kids things like how to line up at school. If you're not careful what they notice because they're using single attention is they notice Jane is at the front of the line, Andrew's in the middle, Michael's at the back. You go to school the next day and Jane is not there. She's sick. He can't line up. So you have to be very careful, haven't you? But generally speaking, visual tactile practical role play, all these sorts of things are really great mediums for building the understanding that you guys have that I mightn't access, because all of my attention is in one place. You probably have your ways and means of feeling okay again. 

01:57:35
Behavior Self talk, talking out loud, finger flapping (help me to make sense of the world/feel OK) Pacing up and down/panic attacks frequent occurrence. Less likely if I am prepared and informed. Need to feel soft material, spin objects, fix on colored or reflecting lights, rock, suck the roof of my mouth (less often now as an adult) Comes from strong need to feel 'in control'. 

01:57:35
WENDY LAWSON It's just that because there is more of you doing it you get a way with that, don't you? I think that's what's happening. So the sorts of things I do, I used to flap, flap quite a lot as a kid. I don't to do that quite so much. I've adapted. I do a thing with my fingers which nobody notices, except that I just told you all, so now you all do. But, I do that with my hand down at my side. And I've learned how to do things, hands in pockets. I used to stroke people's hair, my mom in particular. I'm not allowed to do that. I don't do that anymore. Stockinged legs, they're really nice. I don't see so many of them anymore, but, uh, I'm not allowed to do that either. Those sorts of things I don't do now as an adult. I've learned how to do different things to help keep me feeling okay. But, you can understand I think, you if you can understand autism. Our attention is all in one place, then, we might be drawn to tactile. We might be drawn to smelling something. We might be drawn to everything in the mouth. These are individual states rather than integrated as they are in typical development. Pacing up and down, panic attacks, much less occurrence. They still happen to me. I still experience some of these things, but most of the time I'm pretty good and know what to do about it. But not as a kid. As a kid I didn't know what to do. I've been run over so many times because I'm no good at crossing roads. I've been run over as an adult, not just as a child, because I'm still not good at working out distances with traffic. Traffic I find is one of my biggest issues, being in a place with lots of crowded people and vehicles. I might see something that I really like that's nice and bright and red. The problem is it's on the other side of the road, and I forget to look. And that kind of thing still happens to me. 

01:59:30
Sensation Very sensitive to light, sound, touch and texture. Have learned how to use shades, earplugs, avoid people and social situations, and tended towards wearing non-scratchy cotton clothing. Need TV and/or radio to be on low volume. Quickly overloaded by lots of chatter (crowds in shopping centers etc.) 

01:59:30
WENDY LAWSON Sensation. I've said earlier that we're all, we tend to be, not all, a lot of us are really sensitive to things like light and sound and touch and texture. I've learned to use shades, my Irlen lenses, earplugs. Avoid people and social situations. Don't you do that sometimes? Absolutely. Do think of this as a social situation? Yeah. Aren't you glad that you're down there? That's what people tell me. That's a nightmare to me. I'd much rather be up here. This is great. I have, I know it's probably, uh, a wrong belief, but I have a sense of control up here. And I, I like that. Whereas down there I just, no that would be a nightmare for me. Very very difficult. What about, do you get the sense of people behind you, in your back? Some of you do. Oh yes, we have a few. That's why you're down that and and not up here. Yes, it's interesting, isn't it? Well, I think you know what I'm on about. I need TV and radio to be on really low volume. This irritates my family. My son has autism. He likes everything loud. He's not like Wendy. So he has to have his earphones on and we have to have rules about what he can do so we don't upset everybody else. Quickly, overloaded by lots of chatter. Are classrooms nice quiet places? What about the schoolyard? Right. I used to spend hours just walking on the white line in the schoolyard because it's predictable. But working out other kids, that was a nightmare. Very difficult thing to do. Wouldn't it be great if we let our kids have time in the library instead of sending them back to the playground? Or what about on the computer? That would be great. If we had to get them back to class, well, we need another lecture for that one. 

02:01:20
Differing design for different jobs? Neuro-typical design fits is the ability to divide attention and accommodate multiple interests in the chaotic world we live in. ASD design fits with focused attention, single interest (great in the creative world of arts, & vocations meeting focus i.e. engineering) 

02:01:20
WENDY LAWSON I guess what I'm saying this whole time together, uh, is that there are different designs for different jobs. Neuro-typical design, dividing attention, fits with the ability to accommodate lots of, lots of interests in a very chaotic world that we all live in. ASD design however tends to fit with focused attention, single interest. This can be absolutely useful and great in things like creative world of arts and vocations that are things needing focus like engineering. 

02:01:50
Single Attention & Associated Cognition in Autism (SAACA) Monotropism(Attention: governed by single focus) from which comes the following: Literally: appreciation of form, black & white concepts, problems with gray areas, honesty. Thinking enclosed pictures (or closed concepts) great for attention to detail. Lack of generalisability (perfect for spotting patterns and themes" Timing and sequencing applications to nonsocial activity. Forward thinking connected with development of focused (single) interest 

02:01:50
WENDY LAWSON But it isn't just engineers. You know, I can't think of the guy's name. There was somebody in the second world war. He coded the Nazi codes that enabled us to win the war. Does anybody remember his name? He wasn't socially equipped, but he was great at interpreting codes and patterns. In retrospect he would qualify for a diagnosis of autism. So do we need people like us in the world? Absolutely. Even that little person who picks, picks up the fluff off the carpet. Who knows what future is ahead? I think we're far too quick to, to try to put typical labels on kids. Let's make everybody typical. I wouldn't want to be typical. I think you have a very hard time, and there's no way I'd swap places with you. Okay? Monotropism, attention governed by a single focus, some of these things will come from monotropic attention. We might be very literal. That may be what gives us an appreciation for black and white context. There might be problems with gray areas, but maybe you need us to keep you honest. It's a thought, isn't it? Thinking closed concepts or closed concepts or closed pictures again can be really great for understanding and focusing on some of the things like details. What about map reading? What about drawing maps? Lots of auty people in that industry. You need us. You'd all be lost without your, your maps, your mail ways(ph) and AA's, etc. Lack of generalizing. Well, that might be terrific at spotting patterns and things that you guys might miss. Timing and sequencing. Yes, there might be problems with social activity, but maybe it could be really useful to non-social activity. Again, it might be something you really need us for. Forward thinking. We're not very good at that unless it's connected to our interests. So things that are around my PhD or writing a book or, you know, I can really be good at organizing that side of things. That's what I'm interested in. That's not quite the same as washing up in the kitchen or doing the domestic work in the house. That's, do you have domestic work in your house? It's really difficult, isn't it? I don't know how people cope. But that's okay, there are other people who do that quite well. So, I think we should leave it to them. 

02:04:25
I'm not naughty or stupid, just autistic AS individuals often literal, black & white, and appear stubborn. Using visual timetables to explain time & expectations helps us adjust and understand what to expect. Using our 'interest' to motivate and reward, great way to create a positive experience of expectations. 

02:04:25
WENDY LAWSON So, I'm not naughty for stupid, just autistic. AS, yeah, autistic spectrum individuals are often literal, black and white. This can mean we can appear stubborn. It might be more that we haven't a concept to be any other way until you paint the picture and actually introduce us to those concepts. You might need to use visual timetables. You might need to use pictures and stories and comic strips, cartoons. You might need to use, uh, video games. You might need to use a laptop. You know, my laptop is my best friend. Absolutely. So much, I can connect to and relate to via my computer that I can't do, uh, typically. Because the typical world is far too fast for me. Technology is a tool that could be in autism what braille is to people who are visually impaired. I think technology is underestimated, and we don't use it enough. Yes, and using our interest to motivate and reward can be a great way to create a positive experience of expectations. I'm going to show you this video clip really soon, and then we'll have more questions. But, I'll just finish this bit. 

02:05:45
Discussion I don't want anyone to change who I am but, just like you, I do want to be heard, understood and accommodated. Dismissing who I am or trying to see me as part of a tragic disaster, is not the way to go. As people with ASD we have so much to give back to our communities. 

02:05:45
WENDY LAWSON So, I don't want anyone to change who I am. Just like you, I do want to be heard, understood and valued or accommodated. Dismissing who I am or trying to see me as part of a tragic disaster is not the way to go. As people with ASD, I believe we have so much to give back to our communities. 

02:06:05
We are in this together. Sometimes AS individuals are happy to be involved with others, as long as we understand the concepts. 

02:06:05
WENDY LAWSON So, we are in this together. Sometimes autistic spectrum individuals are happy to be involved with others as long as we understand the concepts. A lot of our difficulties and behavior problems that you are aware of are because we don't understand the concepts that you're trying to work with. When those are explained and we've understood them, our lives and yours will be so much better. I'll read you this poem. This one's called "Whose time is this?" 

02:06:35
Whose Time is This? Whose Time Is This? It's 7am and the alarm clock beckons, "time to wake up" my little clock reckons. "Oh, just a few minutes more, Then I'll get up and be out the door." 

02:06:35
Whose Time is This? Knock knock and knock once more, "come on sleepyhead, get out of your bed" But, I just need more time, My clothes then I'll find" I'll be down for breakfast, just a little more time. 

02:06:35
Whose Time is This? "I'm sorry; I'm late," my friend rushes by, "I ran out of time, can't stop and chat." The rain and the wind heave a big sigh, as I get to sit and talk with my cat. "Why are people always in a rush?" "They tell me that time waits for no one." So the queue, push and shove 

02:06:35
Whose Time is It? But isn't it true, times on our side? We do not know this, so, from time we hide. We take our time deciding whose time, Will it be yours or will it be mine? 

02:06:35
Whose Time is This? I don't know what time will bring, But I do know a couple of things. Time is our slave and not our boss, There is time to prosper, There's time to be lost. 

02:06:35
Whose Time is This? Whatever the time and for whomever we call, There is time for one and there is time for all. Knowing which is whose time to be, Knowing there's time, for you and for me. 

02:06:35
WENDY LAWSON Whose time is this? It's 7am and the alarm clock beckons, "time to wake up" my little clock reckons. "Oh, just a few minutes more, Then I'll get up and be out the door." Whose Time is This? Knock knock and knock once more, "come on sleepyhead, get out of your bed" But, I just need more time, My clothes then I'll find" I'll be down for breakfast, just a little more time. Whose Time is This? "I'm sorry; I'm late," my friend rushes by, "I ran out of time, can't stop and chat." The rain and the wind heave a big sigh, as I get to sit and talk with my cat. "Why are people always in a rush?" "They tell me that time waits for no one." So the queue, push and shove. Whose Time is this? But isn't it true, time's on our side? We do not know this, so, from time we hide. We take our time deciding whose time, Will it be yours or will it be mine? Whose Time is This?

Whatever the time and for whomever we call, There is time for one and there is time for all. Knowing which is whose time to be, Knowing there's time, for you and for me. I actually believe that there's never been a better time to be autistic. I really believe that. With all that's available through technology, we have a lot of devices and all sorts of support that we could be using to make education and learning accessible for those of us who are autistic.

WENDY LAWSON There's my resource page. The page at the top, no, the homepage address at to the top is mine. www.mugsy.org/Wendy. Autismandcomputing is a link to my webpage, and, uh, it's also (inaudible ) webpage. Then there's various aspects and information about attention and technology, etc. on that page. Amanda Baggs, the video I want to show you real soon, her own webpage, Getting The Truth Out. You can find out about Amanda on www.autistics.org. The video I'm going to show you is called "In my language" and that longer line there is where you can locate that. I have lots of books I've written on all sorts of subjects: friendships, sexuality, how to build your life if you are on the autistic spectrum, to an everyday handbook on autism. My books should be readily available in any bookshop. You just got to say, "Please, locate a book on, by Wendy Lawson." I've also got them advertised on my webpage. And just to show you Allie, in case you're interested. Allie grew up. She, she grew out (inaudible ). She looks, she has a son, she has two sons, but her youngest son hasn't been to school since he was 12. He's 28 years old now. And, uh, we all know that he is on the autistic spectrum. He has Asperger's syndrome. He's doing very well in lots, and lots of ways. Allie herself works with, with autistic kids. And, yeah, she's all right actually. She turned out all right despite her being typical. The young man on the couch, the one with the long hair is my son, Tim. And the girl with, with the shorter hair there is my daughter, Katie. I thought it might be nice just show you a small video clip. All of these video clips that we're looking at today you can find on YouTube.

A Translation 

02:10:25
UNKNOWN The previous part of this video was in my native language. Many people have assumed that when I talk about to this being my language that means that each part of the video must have a particular symbolic message within it, designed for the human mind to interpret. But my language is not about designing words or even visual symbols for people to interpret. It is about being in a constant conversation with every aspect of my environment. Reacting physically to all parts of my surroundings. In this part of the video, the water doesn't symbolize anything. I'm just interacting with the water as the water interacts with me. Far from being purposeless the way that I move is an ongoing response to what is around me. Ironically, the way that I move when responding to everything around me is described as "being in the world of my own", whereas if I interact with the much more limited set of responses and only react to a much more limited part of my surroundings people claim that I am "opening up to true interaction with the world". The judge my existence, awareness, and personhood on which of a tiny and limited part of the world I appear to be reacting to. The way I naturally think and respond to things looks and feels so different from standard concepts or even visualization that some people do not consider it thought at all, but it is a way of thinking in its own right. However the thinking of people like me is only taken seriously if we learn your language. No matter how we previously thought or interacted. As you heard, I can sing along with what is around me. It is only when I type something in your language that you refer to me as having communication. I smell things. I listen to things. I feel things. I taste things. I look at things. It is not about to look and listen and taste and smell and feel. I have to do those to the right things, such as look at books and failed to do them to do them to the wrong things or else people doubt that I am a thinking being. And since their definition of thought defines the definition of personhood so ridiculously much they doubt that I am a real person as well. I would like to honestly know how many people if you met me on the street would believe I wrote this. I find it very interesting by the way that failure to learn your language is seen as a deficit but failure to learn my language is seen as so natural that people like me are officially described as mysterious and puzzling rather than anyone admitting that it is themselves who are confused, not autistic people or other cognitively disabled people were inherently confusing. We are even viewed noncommunicative if we don't speak the standard language, but other people are not considered noncommunicative if they are so oblivious to our own languages as to believe they don't exist. In the end I want you to know that this is not been intended as a voyeuristic freak show where you get to look at the bizarre workings of the autistic mind. Is it meant as a strong statement on the existence of value many different kinds of thinking and interaction in a world where how close you can appear to a specific one of them determines whether you are seen as a real person or an adult or an intelligent person. And in a world in which those determine whether you have any rights there are people being tortured, people dying because they are considered nonpersons because they're kind of thought is so unusual as to not be considered thoughts at all. Only when the many shades of personhood are recognized will justice and human rights be possible.

WENDY LAWSON I know that's a big confronting, but she's really got a valid point. Any comments or questions on anything we've gone through today? Yeah? 

02:18:05
AUDIENCE What do you say as someone who has Asperger's that being able to (inaudible ) away from other children would've been your preference? 

02:18:15
WENDY LAWSON Would I have chosen to have been schooled away from other children? It's an interesting question. I don't think necessarily being schooled away from other kids would've been helpful. It might've been. But, I think understanding my interests and using them in whatever school setting would have been really helpful. And I think noting times and recognizing when I was overloaded, that I needed space from others whichever school I was at, that would've been really useful too. Instead, because I would react and push on the kids (inaudible ) or do something like that, then I got disciplined, uh, for being naughty. But I didn't know how to say, "This is overwhelming. Keep away." So, I pushed. Yeah, so, understanding and using interest and recognizing overload. Those are the two things I would really wished had been available to me at school. There are some schools in the, the UK for kids with Aspurger's and with autism. I don't think they're quite as common in Australia as they are in other places. Yeah. Questions? Yeah. 

02:19:35
AUDIENCE (inaudible ) oldest boy was quite bright, but he's just so anxious in class all the time because he thinks he's going to get things wrong. (inaudible ) 

02:19:50
WENDY LAWSON I think there are, so did you hear that question? The question was that they have this 11-year-old in class who is constantly anxious, uh, because he mightn't be able to work out that something is going to change, even someone moving a pencil box, uh, away from the spot where it's supposed to be. So, if that's where all his attention is, all his attention is taken up with what might happen and if, that's wearing him out. And, uh, it would be very hard for him. There are a couple of things that might help. One of those would be to let him know what to do when things change, because things change all the time. The important thing is that they are allowed to change. He needs to know that. And then when that change occurs what can happen is he's still okay. He won't feel okay. He's going to feel this is the right. He's got to overcome an overwhelming sense of wrongness, we need to fix it. No, you don't need to fix it. It's allowed. I had friends, this was really disturbing for me, my family in fact would do things like move the pictures on the wall so they weren't centered. I mean, it just drove me nuts. Move my books. Moved things all the time. Absolutely awful. But if I can learn, that is in a nice thing. I'm not saying you should do that. But, if I can learn that if something isn't as it ought to be that that's okay, because I'm okay. That would be really useful thing to teach. It won't be easy to teach, because you're going against what I feel. Does that make any sense at all? I hope it does. So, coping with change is what I'm suggesting, what to do when things change. And another thing, and I think that would be really useful, uh, to lower his anxiety is that he had the pressure removed a little bit from expectation in class. If I have an idea of what to expect, like my timetable lays it out for me, I really need people to stick to that. Yeah? Timetables at school change all the time. So how about we have a timetable that allows for change? Instead of saying, uh, first period Monday morning swimming, it might say main event swimming. Then there might be two other events that could occur. Because of swimming is going to happen, because the bus breaks down or, you know, it's closed for refurbishment or something, then there's other things that might, that could add like games in the indoor hall, time on the computer. And we can tick the one that happened and put crosses by the ones that don't. So that, and you can do this at home. It doesn't just have to be for school. I need to have an understanding of all the variables, and that's not possible, Wendy. So give me a few. To give me an understanding of change, and then give me a few variables that we can accommodate should the first thing not happen. Even with things like take away food, you know, people say things to me like, "We're going to get pizza." And then I know this is really difficult to understand, but they do things called change their minds . That's really hard on Wendy, because I'm set. So how about we just say we're going to have take away. Don't kind of set in stone until the last minute. I know it's take away, but that's all I know. So, giving an outline of what to expect during the day, even inasmuch as where people will, we can expect where they will sit. We can expect what games will play. All sorts of things can be covered. But if something changes, it's okay. It's allowed. And the alternative will be, and you've got a couple of options over here and all the other. Statistically, if you want 50-50, you've got a 50-50 chance haven't you. But if you had three, then the chance of statistics are increased. One of those is going to happen. It's unlikely if you have three that one won't. 50-50, and then you've got a 50-50 chance. Make out three things, you've got an increased chance. So he's more likely to be less anxious. If all his attention is focused on the things he's anxious about, he's not available for learning. So teaching me that change happens and it's okay, uh, and I won't like it, but I need to learn that. Teaching me when change happens this is what it's going to mean. I need both of those. Sir? 

02:24:20
AUDIENCE What in heavens did you learn to step back and say you're overwhelmed? 

02:24:25
WENDY LAWSON When have I learned to step back and say I'm overwhelmed myself? Excellent question. And I still don't always get that right unfortunately. Mostly, today as an adult I have, I can do that, but there are still occasions where I get caught out. If everything around me is really busy, I'm in the bank or shopping center, uh, with other students at Uni, that sort of thing, then I won't recognize it. There's too much going on. I'll recognize things more when I am, I'm just in my usual routine and some things happened. The phone rings. Somebody knocks on the door. Do you know people do that? Do you know that? They just turn up. And they don't let you know they're going to come. That's really hard, isn't it? So, that kind of thing can really throw me, but I cope better with that. Just don't answer the door. I feel better with that than I do when there's so much going on around me that I really can't, don't got, I haven't got the time or the space to process it, then it's hard. Then I have an autistic moment. I am still autistic. I won't, you don't grow out of being autistic. You know that, don't you? You grow up and autism changes, absolutely. And my behavior was such that a lot of you wouldn't even recognize my autism. But, I still have those times when it is quite overwhelming. Just like somebody dozens stop needing their white cane. 

02:25:50
AUDIENCE I have a 15-year-old son, so he's not ready for a relationship just yet when you're talking about marriage. But, in the future, like, are lots of autistic people who are happily moving from their mom and dad to their wife for their husband? Or are they, I just don't know where to put realistic expectations or my expectations. 

02:26:20
WENDY LAWSON Yeah. That's a fair question. 15, is he likely to be able to have a relationship? Is he likely to get a new home? Would he be able to shift his focus of attention from mum and dad both to wife or husband or whatever and so on? I think it's a fair question for any young person. And a lot of, there's going to be a lot of variables. I've know people who have got no desire to be in, in relationship with anybody else, although they think a wife might be useful. I, I do know a couple of young people who have, are now living with women from places like Indonesia because they didn't have the typical Aussie expectation on their man. So, coming over here and doing the wife stuff that the young man is expecting works quite well actually. So, it will depend on all sorts of things, and, uh, these days when is it the kids are leaving home? Before they're 30? So even if you're not autistic, a lot of kids are staying home longer, staying at Uni longer, all sorts of things. I think if I was a parent, as an I am, but I would be guided by what my son or daughter is giving outside of the wanting. At 15 a lot of kids are more like 12, and they may have hormones of 15, but in sort of practical everyday working out of all that stuff they're very much younger. So it might be, you might find that some of the issues of hormones present to themselves way before, uh, the actual practicalities of having a relationship. We take it step by step, day by day. Don't think too far ahead. It'll get you into trouble. Yeah? 

02:28:15
AUDIENCE My friend's son, he's three. How can she tell the difference between naughty and his frustration? 

02:28:25
WENDY LAWSON A question of what is naughty behavior in autism and what is autism? At the age of three, it is really really difficult to tell. At the age of three, that's a typical age when the kid is often just getting a diagnosis. A lot of children aren't diagnosed for three. And, you've got a child who is not settling to anything. Haven't even worked out quite often what their interest will be. They're just scattered like a lot of three-year-olds. So it's difficult. I would still, if I were the parents of that three-year-old, be working with visual timetables to teach what's allowed and what isn't. Lots and lots and lots of pictures. Lots of video. Yeah, (crosstalk) everywhere. Well, I'd try to be honing in on the things that are really important. And the things that aren't I would let go. A lot of kids at three aren't toilets did, toilet trained. 

02:29:25
AUDIENCE No, but because his sister's same age, and she's getting into trouble for doing naughty things. Therefore you've got the rivalry between them. And it's now getting violent. 

02:29:35
WENDY LAWSON So, which one is violent to which one? 

02:29:40
AUDIENCE Both of them. 

02:29:40
WENDY LAWSON They are violent to each other? 

02:29:40
AUDIENCE (inaudible) 

02:29:45
WENDY LAWSON So, it sounds like this is an autistic three-year-old who really doesn't have concepts of standard boundaries about what's allowed and what isn't. What's naughty and what isn't that we use with typical kids aren't really useful in autism because he won't have an understanding of what you mean. And if we spank the three-year-old, which I would not recommend, we're teaching him that when he doesn't like something he has to spank you. You know, I don't think that's useful. I think what we do have to do is step back a bit which is hard I know, but step back a bit and ask ourselves is something happening between these two that's causing more frustration for the lad who is autistic? Is something happening that's causing him not to understand? Does he feel that, uh, you know, he's being violated, etc, which is very young as of three-year-old. Then, we need to deal with that situation quite separately and deal with his twin sister who is typical quite separately. We need to, there are storybooks even for someone, a typical three-year-old who is really quite bright and understands quite a lot. I know, I had a sister, Allie. (crosstalk) But, you can use story to explain what's happening. So we use what is like land. We use stop signs, cross for no, tick for yes, things that are kind of in the outside world, road signs, things like that which sometimes in autism are more recognizable than words. Traffic lights. So use the color red. Stop. You use amber for prepare, green for go, and a lot of backup things. Like, you can have cards with those images on. At three he's everywhere, so it's hard to make him be still long enough to teach him. On the trampoline is a great place for teaching kids with autism. It really is because they are often attending, they are focused and yet they're available for learning quite often because it's not something that requires a lot of attention. When they're happy they'll listen. So, you can make those cards. You can laminate them. You can have them on a key ring. You can have them like a picture book, and you've got to keep it up. And it's hard work, and it's an effort and it's persisting. But, you've got a young man who isn't learning the same way as the sister. The temptation is to judge all his behavior as naughty and he gets away with it. She's not allowed. And that's how it seems on the surface. But a lot of his behavior will be, his tools for letting you know he's not happy and he hasn't understood you and what to do about it. Whereas you can say to her do not like, don't do that, that's naughty, be nice. We see some weird things to kids, don't we? But they understand it if they're typical. He won't. One more question. There's a lady in the back actually? It gave me a handle because I had a diagnosis. It gave me something to work with, and that, that's access to all sorts of things then made my life easier. But, it's been a long process. So I actually think labels can be really useful, and, uh, it can explain things to me. And I can then explain to others. From that perspective yes, my life got easier. From the perspective of my behavior or of what I understand, that didn't get easier so much. I still had lots and lots of stuff to work out because I don't learn typically, if that makes sense. So the label absolutely I think should facilitate a whole heap of information. It explains things. And I think knowledge is power and that makes things easier. But, it doesn't change who I am. My, my label, my diagnosis doesn't suddenly mean I'm not autistic or that I don't have my difficulties. I still do, but it gives me the means to kind of explore how to work with them. Yeah. Thank you very much.
