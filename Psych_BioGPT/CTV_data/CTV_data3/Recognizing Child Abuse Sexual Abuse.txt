NARRATOR Sexual abuse is one of the most devastating forms of child abuse and is an epidemic in the United States. In addition, sexual abuse often goes unreported. According to the most recent information from the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, in a year there were six million reports of abuse and neglect of all types to Child Protective Services. 

00:00:35
900,000 cases 9% Sexual Abuse 

00:00:35
NARRATOR After investigation, it was determined that there were almost 900,000 substantiated cases. Of these 9% were determined to be cases of sexual abuse. This may seem a small number in comparison to the total, but it works out to more than 80,000 cases of sexual abuse a year and many experts feel this represents only a small proportion of the actual number of occurrences. Everyone in health care must remain aware of this significant problem and stay alert to recognize any signs of sexual abuse. 

00:01:15
RECOGNIZING CHILD ABUSE Part 3 Sexual Abuse 

00:01:25
NARRATOR This is the third of three programs on recognizing child abuse. The first covered physical abuse. The second covered neglect and emotional views. This final program will focus on sexual abuse. There is no simple definition of sexual abuse that is uniform across the states. The most common definition comes from the Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. 

00:01:50
"The use, persuasion or coercion of any child to engage in sexually explicit conduct (or a simulation of that conduct) ...for producing a visual depiction or for rape, molestation, prostitution or incest” 

00:01:50
NARRATOR The use, persuasion or coercion of any child to engage in sexually explicit conduct or a simulation of that conduct for producing a visual depiction or for rape, molestation, prostitution or incest. To be considered sexual abuse, the perpetuator must be a relative or caretaker such as a babysitter. If the perpetuator is a family friend, stranger or otherwise unrelated, the act is considered sexual assault. Sexual abuse includes many types of sexual maltreatment including incest. Incest is any sexual activity between any family members not necessarily just blood relatives, it also includes step parents and unrelated siblings, uncles, aunts and grand parents. 

00:02:35
Molestation 

00:02:35
NARRATOR Another form of sexual maltreatment is molestation. This covers act such as touching, fondling, kissing or any form of genital contact. 

00:02:45
Exhibitionism 

00:02:50
NARRATOR Exhibitionism is another form of sexual abuse. This usually involves the exposure of an adults genitals to a child. 

00:02:55
Child Pornography 

00:03:00
NARRATOR Another form of sexual abuse is child pornography. This is using any form of media to photograph sexual acts involving children or children and adults. Its important to note that the idea of consent is irrelevant. No child and no guardian can give concern to making child pornography. Distribution of this material or encouraging a child to view it on the computer or tv is also considered sexual abuse. 

00:03:25
Child Prostitution 

00:03:25
NARRATOR A final form of sexual abuse is child prostitution. Again, consent is irrelevant. No one can legally give consent to the sexual abuse of a child. The victim of sexual abuse is most likely to be a girl. Girls are four times more likely to be abused than boys. Often, it is the eldest daughter in a family though there is no typical ethnicity or social economic level. Victims come from all areas of society. Boys can also be victims, of course and they are much less likely to report the abuse than girls. Victims of sexual abuse may experience life long emotional harm and difficulty in future relationships. Early detection and therapy may reduce the negative outcomes. The typical sexual abuser is male and often a family member that the victim trusts; though a step father is more likely than a birth father to be an abuser. The abuse often begins with play and innocent seeming caresses, and then the child is pressured slowly towards sexual acts. This is called grooming. There are number of ways that sexual abusers pressure children into sexual activity. In most cases, the abuser is known by the child and maybe a significant part of their life. Often abusers will put themselves in a position to be close to children. The child can be offered gifts or special privileges over siblings. 

00:04:55
 Do you like dolls? 

00:04:55
NARRATOR Also the abuser may attempt to sexualize the child through exposure to pornography. The abuser can misrepresent the abuse as okay and morally acceptable, or very common and harmless. Children who have had emotional approval and nurturing with help can often be enticed by the warmth and contact of someone they trust. Victims are often pressured in the silence by having the abuse described as a special secret between you and me. The abuser often threatens that any privileges will be lost or taken away if others find out. Abusers play on the fears of children, fear of breaking up the family, fear of harm to a parent, pet or themselves, fear of abandonment or fear of being blamed for the abuse. Unlike physical abuse, the signs of sexual abuse are rarely as obvious as bruises and broken bones. All health care personnel must remain especially vigilant for the possible signs of sexual abuse, as well as some suggested behaviors. Over 90% of known sexual abuse victims have no physical findings, especially if you examine more than 72 hours after the allege incident. 

00:06:05
Physical Signs of Sexual Abuse 

00:06:05
NARRATOR Some suggested physical signs included any injuries in the genital area anus or throat including bruises, bleeding, lacerations or scar tissue. Also look for torn, stained or bloody underclothing. However, there are multiple reasons why a child may experience vaginal itching, discharge, pain or bleeding. The examination needs to be conducted by an expert in child sexual abuse to make it accurate diagnosis. 

00:06:35
 …but it hurts a lot. 

00:06:35
 Is it pretty painful? 

00:06:35
 Yeah. 

00:06:40
NARRATOR Listen for any reports of painful urination, swelling, itching or discharge in the genital area. 

00:06:45
 Yeah, better we could go… 

00:06:45
 Hmmm…Hmmm… Does that hurt… 

00:06:50
NARRATOR There can be may other reasons for these symptoms and again the examination must be conducted by an expert in child sexual abuse. Any direct evidence of STDs in girls or boys and pregnancy in young adolescent girls may indicate abuse. However, vaginitis or vaginal discharge may be a benign origin. Any STD assessment, culture and diagnosis in a child who hasn't reach puberty needs to be done by an expert in child's sexual abuse. 

00:07:20
 Um, noticed that the bed was wet this morning. 

00:07:20
Suggestive Behaviors 

00:07:20
NARRATOR Watch for any new reports of bed wetting, complaints of stool problems or difficulty walking or sitting. These may indicate genital problems. Most of these signs taken alone can only increase the level of suspicion and may be, due to other causes. You should also look for suggestive behaviors. Some behaviors that may suggest sexual abuse includes sexually seductive behavior, sexualized play or age inappropriate sexual knowledge. In older children, the sudden emergence of excessive masturbation or promiscuity should also be noted. Most masturbation is considered normal. Watch for withdrawn behavior, especially around adults. Look for day dreaming or retreat into fantasies, or report of a sudden onset of nightmares, and look for any regressive behaviors such as thumb sucking or need for frequent naps and look for a sudden onset of phobias, fear of the dark, fear of men, fears of leaving home and fears of being left alone. Watch for any sudden changes in the child such as a weight gain or loss, a new anxiety or inappropriate clinging behavior. 

00:08:35
 It's okay Kailey 

00:08:35
Suspicious Caretaker 

00:08:35
NARRATOR There are also a variety of abnormal behaviors that could suggest any number of emotional problems, but should be kept in mind, if they reinforce other signs of sexual abuse. Look for unusual aggressiveness toward other people, animals, or toys. Also look for reports and running away from home and a rapid decline in school performance. In older children, watch for signs and reports of depression, anxiety, suicide attempts or forms of self-mutilation and substance abuse. And any apparent fear of a parent or caretaker or a fear of going home. None of these behaviors is as an absolute sign of sexual abuse, but they should be kept in mind. Whenever, there is any reason to suspect abuse, the suspicion must be taken seriously, but also cautiously. There is a tremendous controversy about the use of children's drawings at anatomically correct dolls to draw out information. False accusations of sexual abuse have created splits between parents and destroyed families. You should lead tools like this to professional investigators and forensic social workers. Keep yourself informed as to the availability of resources that are in the community is essential to know to whom these children should be referred. As with all forms of abuse, healthcare worker should remain alert for any suspicious behaviors on the part of the caretaker as well. This can present as a lack of concern for the child and the child's reaction. 

00:10:05
 She just has a real act of imagination. 

00:10:05
NARRATOR Especially, a denial of any sexualized behaviors after an allegation has already been disclosed, and watch for signs of drug use and drunkenness or any signs of mental instability in the caretaker. In addition, there is a strong overlap between domestic violence and child abuse. For many healthcare workers, the disclosure of sexual abuse is one of the most upsetting situations faced in pediatrics. 

00:10:30
 I know it's difficult for you to hear this. I’ll, I've to report this. 

00:10:35
NARRATOR As difficult as it maybe, it is our responsibility to advocate for the child. Protection of children is our responsibility. If you suspect that the child is being sexually abused, ask a few open-ended questions in order to secure enough information to notify Child Protective Services 

00:10:55
 And what just that feel like? 

00:10:55
Reporting Sexual Abuse 

00:10:55
NARRATOR Under no circumstances should the nurse or other pediatric care provider extensively questioned or interview the child. This needs to be accomplished by a specially trained forensic social worker or investigator or a medical expert in child abuse. Many communities have a child advocacy center or team of trained professionals to handle the investigation. Ask only enough questions to make an appropriate referral. If you do encounter reasonable signs of sexual abuse, you must report them to Child Protective Services. It is important to work together as a medical team in the assessment and planning of an intervention in suspected child's sexual abuse. Follow the protocols in your facility, do not share information with others or discuss the situation with anyone else, and especially do not confront or argue with the parents or caretakers who might be involved. The names of those report abuse are not given out to families. All further action is in the hands of Child Protective Services. Sexual abuse of children is a serious problem in the United States with as many as 80,000 confirmed cases a year, and probably many more unreported cases. Reporting suspect is sexual abuse is mandate, not a negotiated decision. You must report any reasonable suspicions to your Child Protective Services immediately. Your office or hospital should have a written protocol as to the actual mechanism of reporting. So, a trained investigator can take action. We cannot allow the children who come under our care to continue suffering any form of sexual abuse.
