The Evolution of Psychotherapy A Conference 

00:00:35
Reality Therapy with a Simulated Client William Glasser, M.D. 

00:00:35
WILLIAM GLASSER ... role play with Judith, Judith Donally(ph) has volunteered. She's going to role play a client with whom she's working. I'm going to see the client as if it were the first session. I know essentially nothing about this client, as ordinarily when I see someone in my office, I don't know anything about them when they come in. I don't have a long pre-history or form or anything like that. I like to meet them fresh without any preconceptions. Now, role plays are by far the best way to teach psychotherapy. Playing the role of a client can, I think, be as instructive as playing the role of a therapist. Sitting and like being in the client's shoes gives you the idea of how a client would think. And I think many people who are therapists have also, uh, had some sort of therapy and, and really understand this, but it's still a very good practice. And then to turn around perhaps in the same, uh, hour or two and play the, the role of the counselor. Sometimes even having someone play the other, the client that you played before so you can kind of feel it from both ends. But, you can do it any way at all. The main thing is if, if we, like myself, am supposed to be an expert in this field, and all the others here are experts in this field, I think it's imperative, and I think it's been going on all week for us to show you what we do. We may end up at very similar results, but I think most of us do somewhat different things. And what I do is reality therapy which is based upon control theory. And ,knowing the control theory, I think I go into it with a lot of preknowledge, even though I don't know her. Afterwards, I'll debrief what I did, maybe have Judith debrief it a little bit also, and, and then we may have some time for some questions. Now, I'd like to start the role playing. I want to check with the television, if it's ready to go as of now. Go? Okay. So, uh, Judith, you called for an appointment, and, and you're here, and I'd like to kind of hear the story. 

00:03:00
JUDITH Well, I've been very depressed lately. Um. 

00:03:05
WILLIAM GLASSER When you say lately, uh, how long would you say? 

00:03:10
JUDITH Um, I'd say about the last three months. 

00:03:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. And before that time you were happy and everything? 

00:03:15
JUDITH Well, no. I went to a, a therapist last year. 

00:03:20
WILLIAM GLASSER So, you were unhappy last year. Were you depressing last year too? 

00:03:25
JUDITH Yes. 

00:03:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. But, recently it's been three months. But, you're experienced with feeling the way you feel now. This isn't the first time it's happened. Is that right? 

00:03:35
JUDITH Um, well, I don't know. My husband and the other therapist thought I just have to change my life cuz I, I'm very self centered. So, I felt like this, but I think it's because I'm so self centered. 

00:03:50
WILLIAM GLASSER And, how come you didn't continue with the other counselor, therapist? 

00:03:55
JUDITH Well, my husband said that, um, we achieved our goal, and it was too expensive to continue. 

00:04:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. And so, this is the clinic, and it doesn't cost so much here. Is that the idea? 

00:04:10
JUDITH Uh, no. I, I came here because somebody told me, uh, that you're good with, with helping, with children, uh, problems with parents and children. 

00:04:25
WILLIAM GLASSER I see. And what's your problem then as you see it? Is it with child or are you the child? 

00:04:30
JUDITH Yes. Well, no. I have a, uh, a eleven year old son, and, um, he's threatened my life. He's been hitting me. And my husband, uh, says I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do. I'm supposed to be taking care of, of him, and telling him what to do. And when I do that, he gets, uh, very angry and, uh, last week he locked me down the cellar steps. And, uh, he hit me over the head and, uh, broke his hand. And, uh, it's been really getting bad lately. 

00:05:05
WILLIAM GLASSER And, is this your only child? 

00:05:05
JUDITH No. I have two other children. 

00:05:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Do they, are you getting along okay with them? 

00:05:10
JUDITH Um, my husband doesn't think I am. 

00:05:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. Well, you're here right now, and I'm kind of interested in what you think. 

00:05:20
JUDITH I don't know. 

00:05:25
WILLIAM GLASSER You're not getting along well with the eleven year old, but how about with the other children? 

00:05:30
JUDITH Well, the eleven year old, he, uh, he fights with them, and, uh, my husband says it's my fault. 

00:05:35
WILLIAM GLASSER All right. Okay. And so, what do you want right now. If you could kind of have a picture of what you want, what do you want? 

00:05:45
JUDITH I wanna make him happy. 

00:05:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Him being your husband? 

00:05:50
JUDITH Yes. 

00:05:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Has he, is he a man that becomes happy easily or have you found it hard to quote make him happy? 

00:05:55
JUDITH He's not a very happy man. 

00:06:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. How long have you been married to him? 

00:06:00
JUDITH Uh, sixteen years. 

00:06:05
WILLIAM GLASSER And you have these three children? 

00:06:05
JUDITH Well, we adopted one, the first one. And then when, uh, the month that, uh, I applied, we applied for the adoption, I got pregnant. I went through with having the baby, so there were eleven months apart. 

00:06:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:06:20
JUDITH And I have one three years later. 

00:06:25
WILLIAM GLASSER And that's the eleven year old? 

00:06:25
JUDITH No, the eleven, I have an eleven year old, a, a ten year old, and a seven year old. 

00:06:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Oh, the eleven year old is the oldest of your, of your, of your own children. 

00:06:35
JUDITH No, the eleven year old I, we adopted. 

00:06:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, that's the adopted. Okay, I get it now. All right. And so, you want to repeat again, I forgotten. What do you want? 

00:06:40
JUDITH I want to make my husband happy with me. 

00:06:45
WILLIAM GLASSER I see. And, what do you do, as far as you can tell, to make your husband happy with you? 

00:06:55
JUDITH Nothing. 

00:06:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. And, what does your husband do, that you can see, to let's say help you to become happy? 

00:07:05
JUDITH He, he'll leave me instructions of, of what I should do for the day. And I try to do it, but, um, lately I can't get out of bed. 

00:07:10
WILLIAM GLASSER What is a typical instruction that he might leave? 

00:07:15
JUDITH Uh, that there's no snacks for the kids when they get home from school. That they should show me their homework that they have to do. And, uh, after they do their homework, they do their chores, and then we have dinner. 

00:07:30
JUDITH So, your husband has written all this out on packet of instructions, is that it? 

00:07:35
JUDITH Yes. 

00:07:35
WILLIAM GLASSER But, you know this. He doesn't have to leave this. These would be the same instructions day after day, I would imagine? 

00:07:40
JUDITH Well, I don't follow them. 

00:07:40
WILLIAM GLASSER I, I know you don't follow them. So, his idea of leaving you instructions doesn't seem to work real well, right? 

00:07:50
JUDITH Right. 

00:07:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. And, then what do you do? You've got his instructions now, and what do you choose to do with these instructions in hand or wherever they are? 

00:08:00
JUDITH I try to do it, but then I have a problem with Billy, um. 

00:08:05
WILLIAM GLASSER What do you choose to do? Not the problem with Billy. What do you choose to do starting in the morning when you wake up and have these instructions? What, what's your, what do you do during the day? What are your choices? 

00:08:15
JUDITH Well, lately I've been going back to bed. 

00:08:20
WILLIAM GLASSER You choose to go back to bed. 

00:08:25
JUDITH Yes. 

00:08:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. And, uh, what's the purpose of that? 

00:08:25
JUDITH I just am so tired. 

00:08:30
WILLIAM GLASSER You're very tired. 

00:08:30
JUDITH Mm-hmm. 

00:08:30
WILLIAM GLASSER And you certainly don't want to follow this list of instructions, then, right? 

00:08:35
JUDITH No, I don't. 

00:08:35
WILLIAM GLASSER And, is going to back bed, you think, something that ultimately will make your husband happy? 

00:08:40
JUDITH No, it won't. 

00:08:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, so you wanna make him happy, but you're choosing to go back to bed. 

00:08:50
JUDITH I don't have the energy to stay up. 

00:08:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. You just can't have the energy to stay up. So what happens in your house if you don't get up with an eleven year old, a ten year old and younger child? 

00:09:00
JUDITH Well... 

00:09:00
WILLIAM GLASSER How do they get to school? 

00:09:05
JUDITH A lot of times they're late, so then I'll have to get up and drive them. And sometimes they go out without their breakfast. 

00:09:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. So, they don't get to school real well. 

00:09:15
JUDITH Not lately, no. 

00:09:15
WILLIAM GLASSER But, aside from your children, what in life, if anything, do you enjoy? 

00:09:25
JUDITH Well, I used to like to cook. I used to make a lot of different things. 

00:09:30
WILLIAM GLASSER That's what you used to like. That's interesting to know that, but I'm talking about now, because kind of problems are right now. You're having this situation now. What do you enjoy now? 

00:09:40
JUDITH Nothing. 

00:09:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Nothing. Your life is without any joy at all? 

00:09:45
JUDITH No. Nothing. 

00:09:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Would you like some joy in your life? 

00:09:50
JUDITH Yes. Yes. 

00:09:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Could you, I mean it won't happen necessarily, but I'd like to hear do you have any kind of ideas or fantasies about what you might be doing now that would be happier than what it, you're actually choosing to do? 

00:10:10
JUDITH Well, I'd like to go back to work, um, and I also thought about doing what you're doing. 

00:10:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Counseling. 

00:10:15
JUDITH Yes. 

00:10:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. And, let's go with the first one, wanting to go back to work. Do you, do you have a, uh, a profession or a job or a skill or something like that? 

00:10:30
JUDITH Um, a, uh, bachelor level nurse. 

00:10:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, so it would be like a, a nursing assistant or LPN or something like that? 

00:10:35
JUDITH No, I have, I'm an RN, and then I have my degree. 

00:10:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Oh, you're an RN? 

00:10:40
JUDITH Yes. 

00:10:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Bachelor's level. You have a registered nurses degree? Have you ever worked as a registered nurse? 

00:10:45
JUDITH Yes, I have. 

00:10:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Thinking back on the past when you worked as a nurse in a hospital was it? 

00:10:50
JUDITH Yes. 

00:10:50
WILLIAM GLASSER In a hospital. Did you consider that you were doing a pretty good job? Were you a reasonably good nurse? 

00:10:55
JUDITH I thought I was. 

00:11:00
WILLIAM GLASSER I mean, your appraisal of it, you held your job all right? 

00:11:05
JUDITH I did. 

00:11:05
WILLIAM GLASSER People didn't complain about you a great deal? 

00:11:05
JUDITH No, I just had a hard time my last year of school. Uh. 

00:11:10
WILLIAM GLASSER But, you graduated and got your degree? 

00:11:10
JUDITH Yes, I did. 

00:11:15
WILLIAM GLASSER What was hard the last year? 

00:11:15
JUDITH Um, I became pregnant and, uh, my husband, we weren't married at the time, wanted me to have an abortion. 

00:11:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:11:25
JUDITH And, I... 

00:11:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Is this the same husband? 

00:11:25
JUDITH Yes. 

00:11:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. Go ahead. 

00:11:30
JUDITH So, I had the abortion. I just couldn't go back to school. I, I mean it was awful, and I went to the counselor there, and, uh, they were kind enough to give me a semester off. 

00:11:40
WILLIAM GLASSER From school? 

00:11:40
JUDITH Yes. 

00:11:40
WILLIAM GLASSER And then, somehow or other, did you pull yourself together then and go back? I guess you did. 

00:11:45
JUDITH I did. I did. 

00:11:50
WILLIAM GLASSER And you graduated? 

00:11:50
JUDITH Yes. 

00:11:50
WILLIAM GLASSER And you, you weren't pregnant with any children when you graduated? 

00:11:55
JUDITH No. 

00:11:55
WILLIAM GLASSER And, uh, this abortion that happened, does this prey on your mind or is this something that you have come to terms with or how do you handle it? 

00:12:05
JUDITH I don't know. I thought I came to terms with it, but at, at this point I don't know. 

00:12:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. You think more though about making your husband happy and your present problems with your children. You don't dwell excessively on this abortion or something like that? 

00:12:20
JUDITH No, I don't dwell on it. 

00:12:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, well, let's leave it go for a few moments. Go back to when you were working in the hospital, and how long did you work in the hospital? 

00:12:30
JUDITH Uh, four years. 

00:12:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Four years. And then, does your husband make enough money so you don't have to work? Or would money be a handy thing to have in your house? 

00:12:35
JUDITH Well, he's in business with his father and his family. They have a big business. Um, and, and he thinks I should stay home. 

00:12:45
WILLIAM GLASSER He thinks you should stay home. 

00:12:50
JUDITH Yes. 

00:12:50
WILLIAM GLASSER And he thinks you should get up and follow this list and everything else. 

00:12:55
JUDITH Yes. 

00:12:55
WILLIAM GLASSER And, uh, we're trying to figure out here what you think. Not that what he says is right or wrong, but what do you think? Are you seriously thinking if you could kind of go back to work right now, and get out of this house that your life might be a little bit better? Is that what you're telling me? I'm not saying he'd agree to it, but I'm just asking what you want. 

00:13:15
JUDITH I, I think my life would be better, except I don't think I can get a job now. I don't think , like I don't know I even got my degree when I look at it now, cuz I, I can't think anymore. 

00:13:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. So, you don't think you're capable of going back to work now. 

00:13:30
JUDITH I don't think I'm capable, and someone did say that I could possibly go back and work in a nursing home, but I don't wanna work in a nursing home. 

00:13:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. That's not exactly the kind of nursing you'd like to do then. 

00:13:45
JUDITH Right. 

00:13:45
WILLIAM GLASSER You did mention you want to become a counselor. Would that entail going back to college and things like that? Is that something... 

00:13:50
JUDITH Yes. 

00:13:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Is that something you believe you might handle better than going back as a nurse? 

00:13:55
JUDITH Well, I would like to do that. I think I could do a good job. 

00:14:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. Well, let's see. I mean, I think that's very interesting to become a counselor. I'm a counselor, and I enjoy it very much. Suppose that you were a counselor right now. You don't know that much about counseling, but you've thought about it a little bit. How would you counsel yourself right now? How would you deal with your particular problem as a counselor, cuz you'll probably see many people with similar problems. 

00:14:20
JUDITH Well, I would tell them that they have to straighten their life up. 

00:14:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Have to do what? 

00:14:25
JUDITH Straighten their life up. 

00:14:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Straighten? Yeah, okay, that's good. 

00:14:25
JUDITH And, uh, that they gee, I don't know. I don't know what I would tell them. 

00:14:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, well, but counselors have to handle these kind of problems. You can't sit there and say, "I don't know." I'm not saying you won't learn in the course of counseling, but, uh, suppose in carrying this a little further, maybe I could teach you a little counseling right now. For example, what would be your fantasy if a woman came in and said , "Well, I just have to please my husband and make him happy. And he seems difficult to please." What would you advise a person like that? 

00:15:00
JUDITH To leave him. 

00:15:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Leave him, huh? And, obviously then, I mean, I'm not trying to be tricky psychological here or anything. Leaving him has passed through your mind? 

00:15:15
JUDITH Yes, it has. 

00:15:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Mm-hmm. 

00:15:15
JUDITH But, I, I, I wouldn't know what I would do. 

00:15:20
WILLIAM GLASSER No, you don't know what you'd do. That's another story, but but the idea of leaving him has passed through your mind. 

00:15:25
JUDITH Yes. 

00:15:25
WILLIAM GLASSER And, although I've asked you some questions about this, uh, why do you want to leave him? Let's spell it out more specifically. I'm not saying you can or will even get to that point, but just you and I talking in an office, you can tell me why you'd like to leave him. That, that hasn't really done anything more than just talk. 

00:15:45
JUDITH I don't like him. 

00:15:45
WILLIAM GLASSER You don't like him. 

00:15:45
JUDITH Not at all, no. 

00:15:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Mm-hmm. So, if, if I asked you this question, and it's obvious, but I'll ask it anyway. Is this man a friend of yours? Your answer would be... 

00:15:55
JUDITH No. 

00:16:00
WILLIAM GLASSER He's not your friend. 

00:16:00
JUDITH No, he corrects everything I do. 

00:16:00
WILLIAM GLASSER A friend is one who's tolerant of another person. Is this ordinarily the way, kind of goes along, avoids the things that they argue about and finds good things and that's not your marriage. 

00:16:15
JUDITH No. 

00:16:15
WILLIAM GLASSER When he looks and talks at you, it's mostly kind of in a critical way, is that right? 

00:16:20
JUDITH The only time he's nice to me is when we're in the bedroom. 

00:16:25
WILLIAM GLASSER I see. And, uh, you mean in terms of trying to induce you into having sex with him? 

00:16:30
JUDITH Yes. 

00:16:30
WILLIAM GLASSER And, tell me about that. 

00:16:35
JUDITH Well, he tells me that I should be more receptive to him, cuz he works real hard all day and, uh, that's my obligation. 

00:16:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. And, has he actually spell, I know people find that, especially married people, find it very difficult to talk about sex. But, still, does he, uh, talk to you about how you should be receptive in any way? 

00:16:55
JUDITH No. 

00:17:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. It's just to kind of figure that out. 

00:17:00
JUDITH Yes. 

00:17:00
WILLIAM GLASSER And, you have sex with him? 

00:17:05
JUDITH Yes. 

00:17:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Is he satisfied? 

00:17:05
JUDITH Yes. 

00:17:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, and are you satisfied? 

00:17:10
JUDITH No. 

00:17:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Why are you unsatisfied? 

00:17:10
JUDITH It's, I guess, because I don't like him. It's... 

00:17:15
WILLIAM GLASSER It's hard to have sex with someone you don't like. 

00:17:15
JUDITH Right. 

00:17:15
WILLIAM GLASSER I mean, it's certainly possible, but it's hard in things like that. And so, one of the reasons you might want to divorce this man would be to at least get out of this unhappy situation, this unhappy intimacy? Have you ever had a happy sexual experience in your life? 

00:17:40
JUDITH No, I haven't. 

00:17:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Is your husband the only person you've gone to bed with? 

00:17:45
JUDITH No. 

00:17:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, but others were not happy too, is that right? 

00:17:50
JUDITH Right. 

00:17:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. And, uh, so here you're married to a man whom you don't like, whom you don't enjoy sex with. Let's talk a little bit about some of the reasons. And I'm not saying you're going to leave him, because it's not easy just to pick up and leave with three children, and the fact you feel so, enervated now. You can hardly get out of bed and everything else. But, nevertheless , uh, what are some things that, that you could see. Say you left him, and say you, let's, how would you deal with the children? Would you leave him with them? Take them yourself? How would you work that out? 

00:18:30
JUDITH I don't know, because I don't, I don't have any money, and, uh, I don't have any family. 

00:18:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:18:35
JUDITH My, my mother died. I had a stepfather who I was afraid of. He used to, um, try to molest me. 

00:18:45
WILLIAM GLASSER He molested you or tried to? 

00:18:45
JUDITH He molested me. 

00:18:45
WILLIAM GLASSER He molested you. And so, certainly was that your first sexual experience? 

00:18:50
JUDITH Yes. 

00:18:50
WILLIAM GLASSER And that wasn't a very happy one either. Did your mother know about this or did she? 

00:18:55
JUDITH No. 

00:18:55
WILLIAM GLASSER You didn't tell her anything. 

00:18:55
JUDITH No. 

00:18:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. And, uh, a lot of people say that if you're molested as a child, you weren't a little child, I imagine at this time, were you? 

00:19:05
JUDITH I was twelve. 

00:19:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Twelve years old. Well, it's not a big child, but you weren't like three or four years old. Um, a lot of people say that once a person is molested that they really kind of have difficulty having a sexual relationship. Do you think this has any effect upon your life or do you think what's going on with your husband is different? In other words, do you believe, if you actually liked this man or even loved him a little bit, and he treated you better, do you think it would be possible even in the sex you're having for it to be better? 

00:19:35
JUDITH Yes. 

00:19:40
WILLIAM GLASSER In other words, you're not so turned off on sex that you just couldn't have it like with anybody. 

00:19:45
JUDITH No. 

00:19:45
WILLIAM GLASSER How about when you first met him, you, before you got married to him. You still had a sexual relationship. 

00:19:50
JUDITH Yes. 

00:19:50
WILLIAM GLASSER This is evidently a very sexual man. He wanted sex right from the beginning. 

00:19:55
JUDITH Yes. 

00:19:55
WILLIAM GLASSER And, did you have any pleasure in it then at all? 

00:20:00
JUDITH Well, I, I really cared about him, so I , um, I occasionally would have some pleasure, but I just really wanted to make him happy. 

00:20:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. You wanted to then, and... 

00:20:10
JUDITH Yes. 

00:20:10
WILLIAM GLASSER And, uh, did he express happiness with you at that time? 

00:20:15
JUDITH When we first met, um, he was, I guess he was in the Navy, and he was on the submarine. So, we met and then he wrote to me these beautiful letters, uh, while he was on the submarine for six months. And the letters were really wonderful and loving. 

00:20:35
WILLIAM GLASSER I guess on a submarine, underneath the water, with a lot of time... 

00:20:40
JUDITH Yes. 

00:20:40
WILLIAM GLASSER ...he, he kind of, he kind of had fantasies that you were a pretty good person, uh-huh? 

00:20:45
JUDITH Yes. 

00:20:45
WILLIAM GLASSER And, and did he, the letters were flowery and loving? 

00:20:50
JUDITH Yes. They were loving, and he sounded depressed. He said he really missed me, and it was very lonely, and, and, um, he couldn't wait to see me when he got back. 

00:21:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. And when he got back, he did see you. 

00:21:05
JUDITH Yes. 

00:21:05
WILLIAM GLASSER And, although it wasn't quite as good as you expected, it wasn't as bad as it is now. Is that right? 

00:21:10
JUDITH Right. We, we had met and went, spent some time in Hawaii. And then I became pregnant and had the abortion. 

00:21:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Mm-hmm. Did, did this man ever kind of spontaneously do anything that you didn't expect that you enjoyed. Did he make loving gestures or anything like that ever? 

00:21:30
JUDITH No, he doesn't. 

00:21:30
WILLIAM GLASSER You went off to Hawaii with him shortly after you got off the submarine? 

00:21:35
JUDITH Yes. 

00:21:35
WILLIAM GLASSER And, and did you talk about anything then? Do you have any conversation? Do you have any interests in common? 

00:21:40
JUDITH No. We don't, we don't, we don't talk about anything. Just that, the things when we were, uh, going together, it was just that he really loved me, and we spent a lot of time sexually active. 

00:21:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. And, but... 

00:22:00
JUDITH I liked his family. I did like his family. I met his family, and they were, there was, um, eleven other children. And, uh, he was the oldest. And it was fun to be around, cuz I don't have a family. And, I enjoyed the family, I think, more than I enjoyed him. 

00:22:15
WILLIAM GLASSER I can understand that. This was, uh, was this a, maybe he's not the most loving type man, but were some of his brothers and sisters people you could relate to and enjoy being with? 

00:22:25
JUDITH I liked his, his sisters. His, uh, he has three sisters that are, are nurses also. 

00:22:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. And, uh, are you, consider yourself a little bit friendly with them now? 

00:22:35
JUDITH Well, they, they'll, they try to tell me what to do, how I could make my marriage better. 

00:22:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, what do they say? 

00:22:45
JUDITH Um, that they're sorry that I'm, I'm depressed, and, and, uh, you know, that maybe I could, I could, uh, talk to them more. Or maybe they can show me, you know, how can I can clean my house better or arrange things or be more efficient with the kids. 

00:23:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Do they actually offer you any actual help like take your kids for morning or an afternoon? Are they that kind of people? 

00:23:05
JUDITH No. They, they have a lot of children their, of their own children. 

00:23:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. This is a family with children, lot of children. 

00:23:15
JUDITH Yes. 

00:23:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. And so, they talk with you, and they, you get along with them. Are you, could you consider them friendly to you? 

00:23:20
JUDITH Yes. 

00:23:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. And, uh, is that a, is that a plus in the sense of leaving him that you would worry about that they might reject you if you left him? 

00:23:30
JUDITH They would reject me. 

00:23:35
WILLIAM GLASSER They would reject you. 

00:23:35
JUDITH They would reject me. 

00:23:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. And, is there anything now, I mean, I'm kind of getting the picture here, and this is a pretty tough situation. Married to someone who's really not your friend. Is he, is he your enemy though? There's not being a friend, enemy. I mean, is he abusive? Is he highly critical? Do you fear him when he comes in the door? Or, or is just, kind of just not your friend. 

00:24:00
JUDITH He's not my friend, and he's very critical. He's highly critical of everything I do. 

00:24:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:24:05
JUDITH He wanted me to get someone to clean the house, and I got a person one day. He said it was too much money, so I didn't understand why he told me that, and then told me it was too much money. 

00:24:15
WILLIAM GLASSER What, what are you finances? Does the man make some money in his father's business, this big business? 

00:24:20
JUDITH Well, he said we don't have a lot of money. 

00:24:20
WILLIAM GLASSER You, you have no idea of your finances, is that, some wives are in the dark about money. Are you in the dark? 

00:24:25
JUDITH Well, I know we have, um, money for the kids' college, and I know we have some savings. But, we have to live on a budget. And, uh, he wants to take the checkbook back, cuz he don't think I'm living on a budget. 

00:24:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. And so, the idea, you're kind of over, a little overwhelmed by this home and everything. Something I would normally suggest if the people had a little bit of money would be, well get a helping person in like one day a week to go through this house and get it cleaned up, and things like that. And, he actually suggested that to you, didn't he? 

00:25:05
JUDITH And, and I did it. 

00:25:05
WILLIAM GLASSER And, how did the, was it a woman that came to work? 

00:25:10
JUDITH It, it was a couple, a male and a female came. And they did a really good job. 

00:25:15
WILLIAM GLASSER House cleaners. They did... 

00:25:15
JUDITH House cleaners. They did, they did a great job, but he said it wasn't worth it when he got, got home. He said he didn't have a chance to really inspect it, but he, he didn't think it was worth it. 

00:25:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:25:25
JUDITH The money. 

00:25:25
WILLIAM GLASSER And, and just, do you know how much you paid them? 

00:25:30
JUDITH Uh, 90 dollars. 

00:25:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. And they probably, this house needed pretty good cleaning. They had to do a lot of work this first time. 

00:25:35
JUDITH Yes. 

00:25:35
WILLIAM GLASSER And he didn't inspect it, a man like him, who's very careful about things and critical? He didn't inspect it? 

00:25:40
JUDITH He wouldn't. He just was so upset about the money, he wouldn't even look at it. 

00:25:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Who got these people? 

00:25:45
JUDITH Um, a, a friend that I know had recommended, uh, this couple to come. And, um, I called them. And they came. And they did a really good job. And I thought he'd be real happy, but he came in and, and he just said it was too much money. You gave them too much money. 

00:26:05
WILLIAM GLASSER So, he didn't really know how much this was gonna cost. 

00:26:10
JUDITH No. 

00:26:10
WILLIAM GLASSER And you wrote a check out? 

00:26:10
JUDITH Yes. 

00:26:10
WILLIAM GLASSER You didn't talk to him ahead of time and say to him, John, or whatever his name is, John, this is gonna cost 90 dollars. 

00:26:15
JUDITH No, I didn't. 

00:26:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. Is it possible he would accept someone who perhaps cost less than that? Or is he, say, you gotta do it? 

00:26:25
JUDITH He thinks I should do it. He thinks he goes to work and I should do these things myself. He said the one time it might be okay because I, I've been really unable to do a lot of work, sleeping a lot. 

00:26:40
WILLIAM GLASSER So, he says you're lazy and go to bed, and you should be getting up and working and all that kind of... 

00:26:45
JUDITH He said I'm very self centered and selfish. 

00:26:50
JUDITH Uh-huh. What does he mean by self centered? 

00:26:50
JUDITH That's what the other therapist said to him. Very self centered. If I would only do what I'm supposed to do, things wouldn't be so bad. 

00:27:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Did the other therapist say to get on the ball and do more housework and take care of the kids more? 

00:27:05
JUDITH Yes. Yes. 

00:27:05
WILLIAM GLASSER And, do you, and your husband said you've gotten good therapy? Is that what he said? 

00:27:10
JUDITH Yes. Yes. 

00:27:10
JUDITH And you didn't do it. 

00:27:15
JUDITH I, I try. I really tried to do it, but I can't do anything right. Whatever I do, it's wrong. 

00:27:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. And, do you think it's possible to do something right for this man? Outside of being enthusiastic in bed, I suppose that would be right. 

00:27:35
JUDITH He likes that. He likes that. If I, if I would only do what he told me to do, I think we would get along. I think that if I, if I only would get on the ball maybe, then things would be better. 

00:27:45
WILLIAM GLASSER We have a lot of different data. You've already told me that you're gonna do what he tells you to do. Just the fact he tells you seemed to be something that you resent. 

00:27:55
JUDITH I don't know what to do. Cuz that's why I'm here. 

00:28:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, you know what to do. You're going to bed. You're not doing it. You're just flatly refusing to do what the man says, aren't you? 

00:28:10
JUDITH Yes, I am. 

00:28:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. Now, it's not a real happy state of affairs, but evidently, I mean, this is how people work. That you're not doing that other, whatever it is, take care of the house and the kids, cuz the way you've figured it out, you'd feel worse if you did that than if you this. Cuz, if you felt you'd feel better, you'd probably do it. You're certainly capable of doing it. Everyone's capable. But you don't want to. Isn't that right? 

00:28:35
JUDITH I don't want to. 

00:28:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. So, now you're kind of at a standoff. You've made up your mind pretty much that you're gonna withdraw from these, uh, familial obligations and household obligations. And, you're coming here to a counselor. The counselor you're coming to, it's not up to me to judge whether your ideas are good or bad or give you direction. I'm not your husband's right hand man. I'm really mostly concerned about you. Cuz, I think there's only success possible in this counseling if you can find something that you can honestly say to me, "Well, Dr. Glasser, I'm I feel good doing this or that or something else." So I'm groping around for what that might be. Now, you said no it's impossible, but I'd like you to think a little more. 

00:29:25
JUDITH I, I'd like to go to school, but, but, uh, he said we don't have the money for me to go to school. 

00:29:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. So, uh, if you'll believe that, which who knows, but, uh, what else might you do besides go to school? Do you have friends, for example? 

00:29:45
JUDITH Well, there's someone that I met on a bible study... 

00:29:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:29:50
JUDITH ...at my, uh, children's school. 

00:29:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Do you, do you, do you go to church? 

00:29:55
JUDITH Yes, I do. 

00:29:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Does your husband go to church? 

00:29:55
JUDITH Most of the time he goes. 

00:30:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:30:00
JUDITH But, he, he doesn't want to get involved. We get to church, and, and I like to stop afterwards and talk to some of the people, but he just says no, we have to go. 

00:30:10
WILLIAM GLASSER How far do you live from church? 

00:30:10
JUDITH Uh, about a ten minute ride. 

00:30:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Which would be a half hour walk, then. 

00:30:15
JUDITH Yes. 

00:30:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. Now we're getting down to some real specific things. I've been groping around for something you could do. You drive to church? 

00:30:25
JUDITH Yes. 

00:30:25
WILLIAM GLASSER And, uh, what city do you live in? 

00:30:25
JUDITH Um, I live in Philadelphia. 

00:30:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, well the Philadelphia weather is kind of average weather. About I'd say half of the year it would be reasonably possible to walk home from church. It's not a terrible neighborhood or anything, is it? 

00:30:45
JUDITH No. 

00:30:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. And so, has that thought ever crossed your mind, to say to your husband, "Well, I'm gonna stay here and socialize a little bit. You drive home, and I'll be home in a little while." 

00:30:50
JUDITH No, I haven't thought about that. 

00:30:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Think about it now. This is a very safe place to think about it. 

00:31:00
JUDITH I could do that. 

00:31:00
WILLIAM GLASSER You could. 

00:31:05
JUDITH In fact, I, I, I wanted to take my own car, because I, I hate when he rushes me like that. 

00:31:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. Taking you own car might be a little bit difficult if you're going to follow through on this plan. It might show him that you have some sort of real feeling for this if you were willing to walk home afterwards. That would send a message. I'm willing to make some effort to do some things that I really want to do. I'm not saying that would make your marriage better, but you might feel better. What do you think of that idea? 

00:31:40
JUDITH I could do that. 

00:31:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Can you tell me how he might handle it? Would he make a scene in church and grab you by the scruff of the neck and drag you to the car or? 

00:31:50
JUDITH No, he wouldn't do that. 

00:31:50
WILLIAM GLASSER That's not his way of doing things. 

00:31:55
JUDITH No, but what he will do is when I get home, he, he wouldn't even yell. He'll just put me down. 

00:32:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:32:00
JUDITH And tell me I'm, I'm selfish and self centered because I wanted to do this, and I didn't think about the family and how important it is to stay. 

00:32:05
WILLIAM GLASSER On Sunday he could take care of the family for half hour, 45 minutes. Even if you are selfish. But does he make any move to take the three kids away from you in things like that? 

00:32:15
JUDITH Occasionally. 

00:32:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. 

00:32:20
JUDITH But, but usually I, I take them to their sporting activities. 

00:32:20
WILLIAM GLASSER So, you have a car you can drive. Well, let's get back to, see the purpose of therapy, you know, and this is not a secret thing we're doing here or anything like this. The purpose of therapy is to encourage you to do some things that aren't really harmful to anyone else. I can't see how staying a half hour, 45 minutes to chat with your friends in church which you enjoy would harm anyone. Uh, the purpose of therapy, if you leave me and you're life has no more joy in it, then I don't, can't criticize the previous therapist, but I don't think it was joyful to be told you ought to work harder around the house. 

00:33:00
JUDITH Maybe she was right though. 

00:33:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, I'm sure you could say that she was right. But, right and what works are two different things. You haven't done it. And my guess is that we could get 98,000 people in here, one after the other, to exhort you to go to work, and you would probably do less and less. But, you could stay after and talk a little bit. When you came home, how would you deal with this man, because how you deal with him if you do that, is crucial in the marriage. Which you wanna leave anyway, but let's say you're not about to leave it today or tomorrow. But, it's in your mind, it'll never leave your mind. You wouldn't have told me so freely if it was. What would you do? Maybe we could role play that. Maybe I could be your husband. And you now come home, and let's say you enjoyed yourself at church, but as you talk with your women friends and looked at your watch and thought about it'd be, I'll be home at least an hour and a half late with the half hour walk home and everything else. Probably a little bit of nervousness would build inside you. So you walk in the house, expecting this, uh, critical attack, you know, not physical but, you know, verbal blows hurt too. Sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can hurt too once in a while. 

00:34:25
JUDITH That's right. 

00:34:25
WILLIAM GLASSER So, I say to you, uh, I say, Judith, where were you? What did you do? We were here. You belong home. 

00:34:40
JUDITH I, I asked if we could stay, and, and, uh... 

00:34:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Oh, I expected you'd stay for five minutes or so. I didn't expect you'd be gone, half the afternoon's gone. It's only an hour and a half, by the way. 

00:34:55
JUDITH Well, I didn't think it would hurt for me to stay. 

00:35:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. So, this is, I mean, we don't have to do this excessively. You would be on the defensive and apologetic and everything like that. 

00:35:05
JUDITH Yes. Yes. 

00:35:05
WILLIAM GLASSER And, your normal way of dealing with this man is to choose to be defensive and try to calm the troubled waters and get through the next hour with as little criticism as possible. But, in no way do anything about approaching your problem, which is a problem. 

00:35:25
JUDITH That's right. 

00:35:25
WILLIAM GLASSER And, you say you're passive and selfish and self center and all that, and I don't want to get involved in that. That's other. Do you think of yourself as a self centered person? 

00:35:35
JUDITH No. I, sometimes I do, but most of the time, no. I take the kids where I have to take them, and... 

00:35:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. You're not a perfect person, but you do some things. You don't just look out for yourself. You have dinner on the table... 

00:35:50
JUDITH Yes. 

00:35:50
WILLIAM GLASSER ...when he comes home. So, what could you say to this guy? This is a crucial turning point in your life. We've come, this a big deal. I, I've now said my critical things. It's hard for me to repeat them, so just presume I said them. 

00:36:05
JUDITH I, I could tell him that I think he's wrong. And I've done that before, but I, I can't hang on to that. I say it, and then something else will happen, and I get real scared, and I start going back to apologizing again. 

00:36:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, so you and I gotta figure out, and I'll help you with this. But, this is my skill really[ph] a little bit. Now, you don't have to do what we figure out. I'm just gonna suggest something. And if you think it's not the thing to do, why goodness gracious, don't do it. But, I think that some way you have to shed this, I'm sorry that I'm alive way of coming home to something a little bit, I don't say highly aggressive or terribly assertive, but something that will kinda catch his attention. 

00:36:50
JUDITH Like what? 

00:36:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, let me suggest something. Say to him something like, "You know," What's his, was his name John that I wrote down? 

00:37:00
JUDITH Yes. 

00:37:00
WILLIAM GLASSER You know, John, what you're telling me now is not really helping me or you or the whole situation in the house. And that would be an exceedingly true statement besides. 

00:37:15
JUDITH Could you say that again? 

00:37:15
WILLIAM GLASSER I will, because I'm sure it passed over your head this time. This is a tough thing. John, what you've just said to me as I walked in the door is not helping you, me or any of the children or what we would like to happen in this house. And then John will static, static, static, static. And then what you should say, "John, what you've been saying to me will not help you, me or any of the other people in this house." You continue on that broken record, because it's gonna take him a while to assimilate that information. I'm telling you this with the assumption this man will not hit you. And you look to be a fairly good size, but if he hits you just stand up for yourself or just walk out the door. But, let's assume that if he hasn't hit all these years, he's not gonna start now. 

00:38:15
JUDITH Mm-hmm. 

00:38:15
WILLIAM GLASSER You're giving him what I call new information. So, he's gonna have to deal with it. Now, we don't' know how he's gonna deal with it, but how would you imagine, knowing him, married to him now for, you know, twelve years or so, uh, how do you think that, uh, he would deal with that? What did I say, by the way? Could you repeat it so I hear that you assimilated it, cuz this is a hard thing to assimilate. 

00:38:40
JUDITH I, I think I heard you say that John, this is not helping you... 

00:38:45
WILLIAM GLASSER No, what you just said to me. 

00:38:50
JUDITH John, what you just said to me is not helping you, me or the rest of the family. 

00:38:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. We might have to write that down and memorize it. Do you think you could say it? I mean... 

00:39:05
JUDITH I think I could say it. 

00:39:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. Now, what would you predict? You know John pretty well. What would you predict that John is gonna do when you come up with perhaps the first really new statement of your whole acquaintanceship to John? You've always been kind of on the defensive with him and kind of thinking, well it's got to be might fault. He says it is. Etcetera. I know you're not saying it isn't your fault, but your certainly saying if there's faults here, let's solve it together, and John, you need to play a role too. What do you think he'd say? 

00:39:40
JUDITH He would try to find a way to put what I said down. He would say I'm not being responsible and say I'm trying to give excuses. 

00:39:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Trying to be what? 

00:39:45
JUDITH I'm trying to make excuses to him. 

00:39:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:39:50
JUDITH For what I'm, for what I did. And that's not gonna help the family. 

00:39:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, then you should just keep saying it. John, you're now saying what I expected you to say. So, I'm just gonna say again, John. What you're saying is not helping you, me or the family. And, John, I'm gonna keep saying this probably for the next two weeks. Every time you say something to me that accuses me of being at fault. Cuz maybe I am, John, but it does take two to tango in every dance. 

00:40:25
JUDITH Okay. 

00:40:25
WILLIAM GLASSER This is a big deal. You're gonna go to church this Sunday? 

00:40:30
JUDITH Yes. 

00:40:30
WILLIAM GLASSER You willing to come back to see me? 

00:40:35
JUDITH Yes, I am. 

00:40:35
WILLIAM GLASSER What if John says to you, "Did you get that from this therapist that you're seeing?" What are you gonna tell him? 

00:40:45
JUDITH Yes. 

00:40:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Absolutely. Absolutely. Tell him yes. Tell him that someone else told you something and you, you followed through on it. But, you could add to this, you could add to this that John, I didn't figure out, but I kind of think it's right. I wish I'd figured it out eleven years ago. Now, if you do this, and you might also while you're talking about it, say, "John. And it's not only what you say to me as you've spoken to me just now. I don't want any more notes either." I mean, you may as well go whole hog this first day. This is, this is the best time to stand up for yourself. The first time is the best time. Now, when are you gonna go to church? 

00:41:50
JUDITH This Sunday. 

00:41:50
WILLIAM GLASSER And, today is Saturday already, huh? 

00:41:55
JUDITH Right. 

00:41:55
WILLIAM GLASSER What time do you leave for church? 

00:41:55
JUDITH Nine o'clock in the morning. 

00:42:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Nine o'clock. Do you have access to a telephone by yourself in that house at all? Like Sunday morning about 8:30 or eight or seven or six? I don't care when. 

00:42:10
JUDITH Yes, I do. 

00:42:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. Would you do me the favor, cuz you know, when you deal with a person like you with lots of problems, everybody I deal with has lots of problems. You haven't any more or less than anybody else. I mean, your problems are your problems. But, there's times especially in the beginning when I'd like to see you a lot, but I can't for various reasons. I don't have to see you. If you just give me a call and you don't have to say a word when you hear it's me on the other end, except to repeat what to me, over the phone. Repeat it now as if I'd called, you'd called me. The word, it starts with the word, "John". 

00:42:50
JUDITH John, um, I can't remember. 

00:42:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. That's good. We'll go through it again. John, kind of repeat it with me like we did in the first grade a little. All the kiddies together. What you're saying, go ahead with me. 

00:43:05
JUDITH John, what you're saying to me... 

00:43:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Now. 

00:43:10
JUDITH now is not helping you, me or the rest of the family. 

00:43:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. Now, I don't care if you write this down and read it to me over the telephone. I don't even care if you come home, take it out of your pocket and read it to him. But, it's imperative, if I'm going to help you, that you learn to at least tell him honestly that the way he's treating you is not helping you, him or the rest of the family. Do you think that's an honest thing to say? 

00:43:45
JUDITH Yes. 

00:43:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. And, uh, in any relationship, I'm not a big deal marriage counselor. I don't use a lot of jargon, but some people would say that what you have established is kind of a dishonest relationship in the sense that you can never really feel free to say what you honestly feel. And, he seems to feel free what he honestly feels, but it isn't seeming to be too helpful to you. So, let's just repeat this, cuz this is hard. What are you gonna do on Sunday morning? 

00:44:15
JUDITH I'm gonna call you. 

00:44:20
WILLIAM GLASSER I'll give you an umber, and I'll answer the phone. I mean... 

00:44:20
JUDITH At 8:30. 

00:44:20
WILLIAM GLASSER What time approximately? 

00:44:25
JUDITH 8:30. 

00:44:25
WILLIAM GLASSER 8:30. Certainly. And you're not gonna get my answering service. You're gonna get me. 

00:44:30
JUDITH Okay. 

00:44:35
WILLIAM GLASSER You're gonna say, "John..." 

00:44:35
JUDITH John, what you're saying to me is not helping... 

00:44:40
WILLIAM GLASSER What you're saying to me now. 

00:44:40
JUDITH Now. 

00:44:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. Make it now. 

00:44:45
JUDITH Now. Okay. John, what you're saying to me now is not helping you, me or the rest of the family. 

00:44:55
WILLIAM GLASSER And if you can't, if you have any doubts about being able to remember it, you'll write it out on a little card and say it to him. 

00:45:00
JUDITH Okay. 

00:45:00
WILLIAM GLASSER And if he says, "Show me the card." show it to him. 

00:45:05
JUDITH Okay. 

00:45:05
WILLIAM GLASSER We could do it kind of fancy, but I decided not to. I was gonna, thinking maybe you should write it on the back of my card, but I think that would be a little bit intrusive. So, just write it on any piece of paper, and I'll think it'll make me happy to think it were my card or something like that. 

00:45:20
JUDITH Okay. 

00:45:25
WILLIAM GLASSER So, that's the end. Can you see me next week? Saturday seems to be a good day for you? He takes care of the kids for a few minutes so you can get away. Does he know you're coming to see me? He does, doesn't he? 

00:45:35
JUDITH Yes. 

00:45:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. And, have you talked over the fee with him and things like that? 

00:45:40
JUDITH No, I haven't. 

00:45:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Does his company have insurance that will cover a few visits and things like this? 

00:45:45
JUDITH He doesn't want to use it. He doesn't want anyone to know. 

00:45:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. So, uh, next week we'll talk about the finances. We have time til next week. You're the kind of person I have a feeling that if there's a bill involved here, a fair bill, you'll, you'll work out how to pay it. It's much more important that you don't concern yourself with this right now, but you concern yourself with what goes on Sunday morning. And, can I count on you? 

00:46:15
JUDITH Yes. 

00:46:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Cuz at 8:30 I'm gonna be waiting for that phone to ring. 

00:46:15
JUDITH Yes, I'll call. 

00:46:20
WILLIAM GLASSER And I might even say something. I might say, "That's good." or something like that. Cuz, it will be real good if you can call me. 

00:46:25
JUDITH Okay. 

00:46:30
WILLIAM GLASSER And so, just so that we don't have any slip ups, before you leave, I'd like you just to sit down at the desk here, you know, and, and write it out. Okay? And put it with you. And put it in your purse. 

00:46:40
JUDITH Okay. 

00:46:45
WILLIAM GLASSER All righty? 

00:46:45
JUDITH Okay. 

00:46:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. That's good. And I'll hear from you Saturday, Sunday morning at 8:30? 

00:46:50
JUDITH Yes. 

00:46:50
WILLIAM GLASSER And then whatever happens, it could be disastrous on Sunday. It could be be good. Whatever happens, say to yourself, "I'm gonna talk this over with Dr. Glasser next Saturday. I'm not alone in this deal." Okay? 

00:47:00
JUDITH Okay. 

00:47:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. Thank you, Judith, very much. 

00:47:05
JUDITH Thank you. 

00:47:05
JUDITH All right. Okay. We, we have, I mean the purpose of reality therapy is what you saw demonstrated is, we try all of us as hard as possible. Each time we see the person, and certainly I try very hard the first time to get something behaviorally going that might take her on some sort of a , a step in the right direction. And, I think this will, although it could be a very, you know, tenuous step. But, it, it gives her something tangible. We're not just dancing around on the ceiling. We've gotten to some relatively concrete things. Now, I know in the things that she brought up many of you say, would say to yourself, "Well, you should have covered this more or that more. Handled this." And, and, and you're all right, a hundred percent right. But, this is what I did when, when you're doing therapy in front of a large group or with her by herself, it's really the same thing. It's going all very, very fast. And, you know, it's like that starlight express last night. It's kinda going that fast. And so, it's easier, and I've done this plenty myself, sit by and see other people work. I saw Dr. Rogers work on TV. And, I could have said, "Wow, I would have handled that a lot differently from him." But, that's easy to say when you're watching and more difficult when you're doing it. But, I recognize that that's possible. I'd like to, this was although she certainly by the end convinced me it was her, it was not Judith playing this particular person. This is the client she's working with. Judith could you give these people any feedback on, you know, your feelings about what went on between you and me? 

00:48:55
JUDITH Um, I, I liked it. It, uh, I do some of what you've done. But, this kept me very focused on something I could accomplish. Um, usually, uh, I've done with someone like this is very difficult because they have so many problems and there's so much going on that you would wanna fix. And so I put myself in her place, and I could, I was able to see how she felt. You know, and I think just the one problem or the one situation was really good to look at. 

00:49:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. See, it doesn't make any difference if the person has a thousand problems. If they can handle one aspect of it successfully, they can begin to handle the rest. And so, as a counselor I try to find some possible thing we can begin to deal with to make a, a kind of first step. But, a first step is a big step. And I'll help her with that. And, uh, but I, I'm not gonna have her call me afterwards. I want her to kind of stew about that all week and think about it, because we'll then come back and, and really talk about it. It should be interesting. If we, if we had more time, which we don't, uh, it would be nice to see her the week afterwards too, but, uh, we'll just have to let that go. Is anyone in the audience want to, we have I think about a little over five minutes. Is that right? To raise a question from, I can't see you at all. 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN I have a question. 

00:50:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Oh, here goes the light. Yes. Is, is, are you the person? 

00:50:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:50:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Oh, go ahead. Thank you. 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN Um, I was very concerned about this patient. I saw a lot of red flags for domestic violence, including that her son was now starting to beat her. That her husband was very controlling, that she was severely depressed. That she'd been abused as a child. And what I heard you saying was, he's not abusing you, is he? And, I'm assuming he's not going to hit you. 

00:50:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, I meant physically abusing her. 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN Well, that's what I mean too. I mean, I think this woman's being abused at home. And I'm concerned, and I'm wondering... 

00:50:55
WILLIAM GLASSER In other words... 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN ...why you never asked her questions about, are you afraid that he might hit you? Has he ever done anything that was frightening to you? Has he ever threatened you? 

00:51:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Those questions are right on the tape. You'll see them. They're right on the tape. I went through that with her. Has he ever hit you? Are you afraid he will hit you? I asked her right then, and she said no. I mean, if I bore in like a district attorney and start focusing on my agenda, which is I'm sure, lady, you're being abused, I don't do that. I'm certain that you may do it, but I did what I did. I mean, I recognize that abuse was possible, but I think she's safer in doing this than continuing to be the wimp that she is. Wimps get hit much more than people who under certain circumstances stand up for themselves. And, had I any idea at all that she would be blackened, that she would be blackened up and bruised by this man, I would have, I might not have taken a different approach, but, uh, handling the domestic violence, this is the way I'm handling it if it exists, or if it potential to exist, this may be the way that, that circumvents it. But, I said in the beginning, there were a lot of red flags here. There's someone over there. 

00:52:10
UNKNOWN At times, I felt as though the session was a little stagnant, not having the husband there. Uh, from a reality therapy position, would it have been better to have him there in the session or future sessions? 

00:52:25
WILLIAM GLASSER I think that having him there, this intimidating person, we'd have gotten nowhere in the first session. I think she needed to be with a supportive person by herself. If I continue from, if I continue from experience treating this woman, I don't have to call him in. He's gonna be there. 

00:52:40
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:52:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Yes. 

00:52:45
UNKNOWN Uh, one of the questions that I had when I was thinking there was, it seemed that Susan was, uh, in a, uh, situation where she did not have very much power in that family. Would you get around to dealing with the issue that maybe the eleven year old is sort of picking up from her, from his father from, you know, this, this is the way to deal with your mother? 

00:53:05
WILLIAM GLASSER The, the eleven year old was an interesting thing, but her problems, her problem is not with the eleven year old. It's with her husband. And she's throwing out the eleven year old to try and distract me from that. We can get to the eleven year old. But, she can defend herself against the eleven year old. She has to learn to defend herself against a 45 year old. And so, that's where we'll focus first. If she can gain a little more equality in that relationship, or if she gets the guts to leave it, which probably she won't, but I don't know, uh, she'll handle the eleven year old fine. 

00:53:40
UNKNOWN I had one more question, too, and that's with, uh, you putting yourself in the position of having her call you. 

00:53:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Yes, I do that frequently. 

00:53:50
UNKNOWN Uh, I just, I sort of get the idea of like, you're sitting by the phone, you know, waiting for all these calls to come in. Doesn't that , what happens if you're not there or your sick or whatever? 

00:54:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, it's Saturday calling for Sunday. There's a very good chance I'll be there. If by some miraculous occurrence I'm not there, I'll have someone there to say why I'm not there and that I instructed you to tell that person what you're going to do when you leave church. But, if you don't get the idea that I've been bombarded with phone calls. I've found that making myself open and accessible to people, they don't abuse it. And, I, and I tell them I wanna do this so that you feel you can reach out to me, but you have to understand I have a life to live too. And if every time that you call me I can't deal with it. And I really, I had in all the years I was in practice one young woman I think abused it a little bit, but I was almost my first or second or third patient that I got in practice. I'm not as sharp then as I, I've learned more. I mean, the Pennsylvania Dutch say, We get too soon old, and too late smart. And, maybe it's late, but I've gotten smarter. Yes? 

00:55:00
UNKNOWN Um, two parts. Do you pass out your home phone for this? 

00:55:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Oh, absolutely. 

00:55:05
UNKNOWN Okay. And second part of the question. Presumably she doesn't or a patient doesn't respond to the phone calls. I imagine that becomes grist for the mill on further sessions? If someone continues not to respond to your directives, you just try to search for a new directive? 

00:55:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, I mean, hypothetically, she might not call. But, but, my experience when I used this technique is that they do call. But, uh, any problem that comes up, including the first questioner about the potential for domestic violence, anything that's in the air, this is the first session. It took about 40 minutes. In my office I ordinarily had full hour sessions. But, uh, and with this woman I might have even run over, which I did do in my office. And the next person waited. I said, "Look, I had to talk to this person longer, so you're gonna have a shorter session, but the time comes I have to talk to you longer, I'll run over with you too." And, my patients all accepted that as a perfectly reasonable thing. I said, "I just had to talk to her longer." But, I'll handle, I'll handle anything I can, but I can't tell you specifically what I do. I don't ignore anything, but as I say, it's all going pretty fast. I want this woman to leave. And I think other counselors or doctors here have talked about, I want her to leave with the sense I'm on her side, she's got an advocate. I'm not gonna do it for her, but I'm gonna help her to do it herself. And that there's some hope here. She evaluated. I gave her the chance to evaluate that behavior. And she said that she could do it. Now, other people would say you might have forced her into it, but if she don't wanna do it, she's not gonna do it. My, my experience is that she won't do it as well as I said, but she'll do it well enough to kind of break the, the thing. Dr. Harrington, my great teacher, described persons like her, which are very frequent, as, as if they're a piece of paper on a paper spindle. And they're just spinning on the spindle. They're doing a lot of stuff and burning a lot of energy, but they're never getting off the spindle. What I try to do in the first session or as soon as possible is get her off the spindle. As long as she's on that spindle, there's no hope. When she says to her husband, "John, etcetera, etcetera." I've forgotten it now, but I would have remembered it. John, uh, she'll be off the spindle when she opens her mouth to say that. And things will change in that house. And that's what she's here for. Is there another person? We have another minute, go ahead. 

00:57:40
UNKNOWN Uh, what about assessing her meds? I mean... 

00:57:45
WILLIAM GLASSER I, I don't, I never gave medication as a psychiatrist, and so I wouldn't even think of meds in this particular case. 

00:57:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:57:50
UNKNOWN I could assume how you'd work with a couple, however without making... 

00:57:55
WILLIAM GLASSER You'll see that this afternoon at three o'clock, if you wanna come. 

00:57:55
UNKNOWN Okay. Could you speak a bit, however now, about what would be the differences perhaps in working with a couple? 

00:58:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, I only have a minute on this tape. So, I can't say that then, but if you'll hang around for a moment, the tape will end, and then I can tell you. I'd like now to , to end the tape at this particular point. Thank you.
