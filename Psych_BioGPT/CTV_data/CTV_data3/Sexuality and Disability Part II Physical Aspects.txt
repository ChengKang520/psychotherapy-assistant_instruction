00:01:00
ROBBIN MILLER Host. Miller Chat Hi, welcome to another episode of Miller chat, I am Robbin Miller. This is part two of a series on sexuality among the disabled. Our second segment will be on sexual functioning of persons with disabilities. My guest as was in the first series is Sonya Perduta-Fulginiti. She is an RN, MS Certified Rehabilitation Nurse. 

00:01:20
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Yes. 

00:01:20
ROBBIN MILLER Welcome to the second part of the show. 

00:01:25
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Hi Robbin glad to be back again. 

00:01:25
ROBBIN MILLER Yes, thank you. All right lets go right into it. Um, that's… here is the first question. Is there anything one should know about becoming sexually intimate(ph) with the person who has a disability and where does one learn about this? 

00:01:40
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI RN, MS, CRRN Yeah, there are certain things that may be different, when you're becoming sexual with someone with the disability, whether they have movement or they lack the sensation of touch, whether they have joints that ache or whether they cannot see everything or actually don't hear anything or don't speak. So there, there are many things you need to learn, um or get to, get to know before you become sexual with the person. And we already looking at maybe already having been dating and enjoying that kind of stuff so then what happens when you want to become sexual, the best thing to do is hopefully the two people, um have pretty much um, developed a sense of trust and communication and therefore can, can talk about what the person's needs or what they can feel, what they can do, what can't do and what they might need help from with their partner. And I call that kind of getting ready in a preparation for sex, and a lot of people with disabilities will inform their partners or potential partners of what they may need help with or what might occur during the sex, other people like to keep it a surprise and sometimes partners don't want to know. Sometimes partners want to keep it a surprise too and keeping more spontaneous. But the key is good communication and let each other know what, what the needs and what you would like to have done sexually to feel really good. 

00:02:50
ROBBIN MILLER Tell(ph) the ground rules? 

00:02:55
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Yeah definitely, definitely ground rules. But there are some things like some people with disabilities may wear catheters, ahh some people with disabilities may have a lot of pain in their joints and may have spasticity at certain movements during, during sex. And if the partners is not aware that these things are going to happen or that they are present they may be embarrassed by other person with a disability or maybe embarrassed by it or may just offset the mood somewhat. So sometimes it's better to talk about it. 

00:03:20
ROBBIN MILLER I always have a question and maybe somebody asked me this, what do you do when you have two people, who are quadriplegic or they both have problems with bodily movement. Do their PCA explain all of these. 

00:03:35
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Oh, yeah, um for people who have severe mobility issues say someone, who two people with quadriplegia and quadriplegia meaning that you have no function of your arms, or trunk or your legs or someone who maybe have cerebral palsy and be pretty spastic, you know they're, they're spastic type and they don't move or don't voluntarily move very well. So what happens then is sometimes there will be a third party involve and that would be their personal care attendant and the personal care attendant can be involved in, in many different ways, I guess. They can just help one partner get ready, get undressed, maybe positioning them close together. Um, and maybe even stay in the room to offer some help with other types of activities, maybe changing positions. But that's all up to them as a, as a group (inaudible ). Um, it's not that the PCA gets involved with them sexually. Um within the activity itself, but just may help position them. And I guess, maybe in some instances depending upon what the people want, the PCA may get involved they just depends on, you know what's happening with the adults within the room. 

00:04:40
ROBBIN MILLER Well, I've heard stories of… of manai(ph), I guess, you know what's that French term… 

00:04:45
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Manajatwa. 

00:04:45
ROBBIN MILLER Yeah, although have an orgy and I can well, I can, I can just imagine the different perceptions and experiences and communication and probably has to go on. 

00:05:00
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Right, yeah. You have to… you have to feel really comfortable with who you are with and the two people who are having sex needs to be comfortable with the third person to, to have been request to have maybe legs moved or arms moved or, or to be brought closer together. But as I said, when two people really wanna have sex they figure out a way to do it. Um, I mean, I'm sure we all know what that feels like when you, when you are excited and aroused then you want to be with the person that is arousing you and making you excited, you will find a way to do that. It happens in the disability community too. 

00:05:30
ROBBIN MILLER You know, was that, what that part of your teaching too, letting them know that, that if they needed to have a PCA, it was okay. Did you teach them how to become more comfortable having a third party? 

00:05:40
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, I don't know if you can teach someone how to do that. I think, I educated them and what their options were and then they have the choice on, on what to choose. I mean, some people aren't comfortable having another person there. As I said before, in the first segment there is some people choose to be celeb(ph) it or some people never have that opportunity to become sexual, so never have that, um that, that decision to make, so to speak that they don't, they don't never experience it. Or even living say, living in a house where your parents are your caretakers. How do you get them become sexual when your mother and father are in the room? Or when your mother and father in the next room or, or those types of issues. There is lots of, of issues like that within the disability community. 

00:06:20
ROBBIN MILLER I remember, I was talking to you about tantric sex. 

00:06:20
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Which kind of sex? 

00:06:25
ROBBIN MILLER Tantric, T-A-N-T-R-I-C. 

00:06:25
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI And what is that? You have to fill me in on that. 

00:06:30
ROBBIN MILLER Oh! With the new mobility magazine on the February edition taking about people, who um, well meditate. 

00:06:35
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Oh, huh! 

00:06:35
ROBBIN MILLER Meditation sex, where they are not touching anybody or they are not touching themselves, but I guess spiritually and holistically, they're breathing in and out in their mind there. I guess. 

00:06:45
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI So they fanaticizing… 

00:06:45
ROBBIN MILLER Yeah. 

00:06:45
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI …and having an orgasm through fantasy. 

00:06:50
ROBBIN MILLER Yeah. 

00:06:50
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Yeah, that's… that can happen in the disability community, I thought we'd talk about that when talked about orgasm, but um, people with disabilities are capable of orgasm and a lot of times um, the medical professionals, especially in those individuals who lack sensations in their genitals will say that it's a fanaticized orgasm or it's not a real orgasm. Umm. But if it makes the person with the disability feel really good that an orgasm is an orgasm and who cares whether it's real or not, I suppose. Um, but yes, I mean when you think about cyber sex. I mean, there are people having sex just writing emails to each other on their computer and there, you know the whole videogame on the computer scene where, you know there is live sex going on and people are live, you know being voyeurs and watching that are actually taking part of self-stimulating. So, there are many different ways to, to have sex. 

00:07:40
ROBBIN MILLER Well, I guess the expression, "If there is a will there is a way". 

00:07:40
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Yes. That's for sure. 

00:07:45
ROBBIN MILLER Well, moving on into um, a different area, some persons with certain disabilities came through all the body parts, such as their breast or penis or pubic area. How do they get turned on, if they can't feel anything on their sexual organs? 

00:07:55
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Alright, I think that's were a lot of times the society gets kind of confused about their people, who can't sex is that, they assume that say someone in a wheelchair, who has paralyses and also has lack of sensation that they, they can't then enjoy sex… 

00:08:10
Miller Chat 

00:08:10
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI …like for people who are quadriplegia or paraplegics and can't feel their genitals and because they can't feel that they are not gonna get excited or aroused, but you don't have… I mean, anyone, anyone just ask to watch a movie that they might find a little erotic or you know, watch back, walk by a construction sites you see a really nice looking guy or guys walking by someone and seeing a nice looking woman. You are not touching that woman, you are not touching your groin, but you are still getting aroused. So it's really a mental function, I mean touching helps, but it's, a lot has lot of do with what's in your mind. These are saying in the, the sex ed(ph) for people with disabilities is that you need to take sex away from between the knees and put it between the ears, where it belongs because you could enjoy it much more if it's in your head and you perceive what's you feeling from our body. And also to remember that not every part of every person with a disabilities body lack sensation. There is some disabilities where people have total sensation like in post polio and cerebral palsy, they have sensation everywhere they just have problems with movement. In spinal cord injury there is sensory loss as well. But those sensory loss areas are pretty finely defined. Um, paraplegics can be you know, waist hips or higher on the trunk, quadriplegics with the arms involve too, but there is always the neck and the ears that you can enjoy, I mean having your neck nibbled or your ears nibbled, peoples eyelids played with. I mean, you can become aroused and, and erotic in those types of areas. 

00:09:40
ROBBIN MILLER So, I guess there is different ways that you can learn? 

00:09:45
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Yes, you need to learn to, to kind of shift your focus again out of your groin and put it elsewhere. Um, again put it in your head and to know that if you are kissing someone, making out with someone, I guess the way I used to when I, when I lecture, I say try to imagine what it was like to remember what is was like, when you were a teenager in the back seat of a car for the first time, being may be kissed, French kissed and touched but no actually touching of… so I guess that would be first base you know, no actual touching of the breast or the groin. But that got you pretty horny you know, and it's pretty much the same thing and people with disabilities just need to amplify that those sensations and they can actually bring that to orgasm. 

00:10:25
ROBBIN MILLER So you teach them like the baseball game homerun, third base. 

00:10:25
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, I don't teach them that. Because, I really don't know that. 

00:10:30
ROBBIN MILLER Ah huh. 

00:10:30
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI But I just try to teach them to try to get, especially if they were sexual before it's, it's kind of hard because they have all these expectations of what it should feel like what you are supposed to do. So, to try to get them not thinking about you know that any more but just try to live in the experience of what feels good enough, you know get in your neck is, the neck is the only place you can feel, when your lover is kissing or sucking your neck and you are liking it then have them keep doing that and eventually it'll only get better. 

00:10:55
ROBBIN MILLER Do you feel that books for those who are able to read, because I know a lot of people with disabilities, who can read. Um, do you think picture books help or having them read books like the joy of sex is that… 

00:11:05
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Oh yeah! I think any type. There is actually studies that proves that with people with disabilities, I think they were more women with disabilities was that um, the more the person read about sex or was knowledgeable of sex, the better they enjoy the sex. That was more gratifying for them. Because then they could utilize and incorporate techniques into their repertoires so to speak. 

00:11:25
ROBBIN MILLER I know we discussed a lack of media attention in our first episode with material, but I know new mobility has affection on (inaudible ) as questions about whatever. Um, is there any books coming out for the joy of sex with disabilities? 

00:11:40
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Umm… I think, no I haven't seen any of that, but there is a book called sexual options for (inaudible ) and quads, that's pretty old but very graphic. Um, there is a book called enabling romance which talks about all different aspects of sexual with many different types of people with disabilities. Um, there is actually lots of material out on sex. You just need to I would imagine go on the internet and look at sex and disability, I'm sure many of them will come up. 

00:12:10
ROBBIN MILLER All I guess, if there is a will there is a way, right? 

00:12:10
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Again yes. If there is a will, there is a way. 

00:12:15
ROBBIN MILLER Alright. Um, what the next question is gonna be dealing with pictures and again for parents, who have children. Again you couldn't have your children going to another room. You could tape the episode and shut the TV off, but parental discretion is advised as well. Alright, people who have spinal cord injuries, spinal bifida, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis or stroke, um sometimes unable to move or can only some of their body parts um, so on. How do these people get undress move out their wheel chairs and have sex so. Let's talk a little about the picturing, you know give like a few descriptions of each? 

00:12:45
Miller Chat 

00:12:45
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Sure. What I'd like to do first is to talk a little bit about the mobility issues, because that is, it's really hard when someone has a disability and, and can't really move. Myself, I'm a paraplegic so it's kind of like hips down, but for someone who has a higher level injury they can't really move around a lot so, their partner or their attendant is gonna have to help them get undressed. Ah, maybe help them into the bed or if that's where they choose to have sex, some people will have sex in their wheelchairs, some have it on the floor, some have it on the table. You know, in the back seat of the car just like anybody else if, again if there is a will, there is a way and if they are capable of doing it. And also it depends upon, I guess the acrobatic skills of the person with the disability and how much work their partner wants to do as well. Um, but they do, some people will need some assistance in getting into certain types of positions, getting undressed and getting sort of speak of ready for sex. But people with disabilities are able to again to get into many different types of positions and there are certain positions that do, do better for people with mobility impairments or for those who may have say pain in their joints and stuff. I brought a bunch of five pictures, I have here to just give you an idea of what types of those positions there are. And for those of you who are able bodied out there or temporarily able bodied, I'm sure you will, you'll see that you'd probably get into some of these positions as well. So, people with disabilities do it too. In this case, um… you have pretty much a man on the bottom, woman on top. It's not the machinery position with the woman on top and the man on the bottom. I mean, with the woman on the bottom and man on top is the machinery position. A lot of times, people the man who may have some mobility problems with the paraplegia or quadriplegia this may be a good position for them with woman, an able bodied woman on top doing most of the, of the energetic work I guess, we could call it. Um, but sometimes in the older, with older men this is a hard position for them to get into because they're, they were more male dominant than have female dominance, so that could be a problem. But this is a position that can be used by most men, who have mobility problem, either paraplegic or quadriplegia whether it would be for spinal cord injury or cerebral palsy, but this I the woman on top position. The next one here is actually the woman on top again but she is kind of straddling her partner. This would be a great position for, for a man who may have problems with his lower limbs whether they be paralyzed or weak or may have some sort of hip um, arthritis or hip pain. The woman is on top and therefore doing some of the work and plus the man can stabilize himself and use his upper arms to, to assist in any type of movement they want to do. And you can also see that the man in the picture has an ostomy bag, which can either have urine or feces in it, I suppose. Um, and it just shows you that this is a position that can be utilized for anyone, who maybe post cancer I mean, have an ileostomy or colostomy bag that this is a great position to utilize so it doesn't put any pressure or weight on that bag. This one here, is a position, um that pretty much doesn't put any weight or any stress on any joints. You can see that people are, the person on the bottom and I actually couldn't tell you, if it was a man or woman on the bottom and who is on top but basically it's just it's no way or stress on any of the joints. So, if anyone has severe arthritis this is a great position, because you are not taxing any of those. And it's kind of a less and if you have say cardiac problems that this is a less taxing kind of position that you don't have to put a lot of energy into it. And it does help people. And still it is, and still it is very enjoyable. This position here is um, excuse me I have to look, is um, a man on his knees women on her back with her legs up. So, someone with paraplegia, a woman with paraplegia or a woman who may have any arthritis in her legs or weak in their legs this would be a great position. And though so that she has basically her ankles kind of thrown up on her partner's shoulders. So this is a good position for that as well as if the woman was in this position, but had her legs down say behind her partner that would be a great position for someone who has back pain, chronic back pain. The woman, it would keep her back flat and she wouldn't have this much, as much pain. And I believe the woman also in this case has what they call as super pubic tube, which is a urinary drainage um, catheter that comes out of the abdomen. Some women have this, some men have it as well. Um, and it just shows that it's taped out of the way and you can still have sex. And jus to let people know as I'm talking about that is even people with foley catheters whether you'd be a man or woman a foley catheter is a, is a tube that's inserted into the bladder all the time um, and you can still have sex with that and men can still have sex with that and woman can too you just put it out of the way. In men it gets little bit more intricate and if anyone wants to know how to do that, you can just call Robbin and I'll find out and I'll let you know. Um, in this position we just have the woman in front and the man behind. And again it is just a position, where there's not lot of weight on the joints, it's kind of an easy position and not a lot of energy is required and either person can have the disability or both people can have the disability. So, those are pretty much position variations that people with disabilities can utilize and it's always important to remember that it depends up on the strength of each person and how much you wanna kind of throw each other round and it kinda can work out. 

00:18:25
ROBBIN MILLER Great work(ph). I appreciate you sharing those pictures. And like you said I'm sure a lot of people who are not disabled probably engaged in some of those positions. 

00:18:30
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Exactly. 

00:18:30
ROBBIN MILLER Alright, let's move on. Let's talk about men. Men with disability? 

00:18:35
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Okay. 

00:18:35
ROBBIN MILLER Let's talk about how can they, can they(ph) get erections and they(ph) therefore not interested in sex? 

00:18:40
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, I think men have it rough sometimes. Um, and again, that's my own personal perspective and it comes years, as I guess knowing some men working with sex educational with people with disabilities, but as in society we grow up that you know, sex is you know in erect penis in a, in a wet vagina and it was some disabilities and actually it's men age you know, getting an erect penis is, is sometimes a hard thing to do or hard thing to maintain. So that can become a problem. So, some men with disabilities do have erectile problems and some men don't. And but there are certain things for the disability community that you can utilize that can help you sustain and maintain your erection. Um, there are certain drugs, I'm sure everyone is really aware of Viagra, Viagra is out there now, really, really strong. Ah, so some men with disabilities utilize Viagra, I mean, spinal cord injury, it hasn't been proven to be that effective yet some men like it, some men don't. So, it's still on the, on the drawing boards so to speak. But there is also medications that men can actually inject into the base of their penis, which give them an erection for, good erection for good hour. And so that can help them kinda keep their sex life every fulfilling. But, the issues that really can happen with that is that, since men are thought that you have to have an erection or you have to ejaculate to really have good sex. I think when they lose that ability to either maintain it or, or get it, get an erection that it can kind of make them think they can't have sex, so they are not gonna enjoy sex and I think that's… I think that's a real injustice to man. It's just my own feeling because again, if you try to remember what it's like to be in the back seat of the car and really feel all those feelings, I'm sure that you'd probably had an erection in the back seat, but ah, it's those feelings that really count, it's what, what you feel that you feel excited and you know horny and and you want to make love to your partner and you feel really good in getting a lot of pleasure that you don't really need umm, an erect penis to do that. Ah, so some men have difficulties with that feeling. They need that in order to have a good sex life. So, that can be, can be a problem. And there are also other kinds of sex toy kind of things that men can purchases of a vacuum device that can help you achieve an erection, but that's kind of a scary thing which you have to either use in elastic band or, or a ring at the base of the penis which in some disabilities can cause skin problems and, and men don't like to have skin problems on their penis. So I recommend… I don't recommend that they use those. But the drugs, the injectables or that the Viagra seem to be working out the best at this point. 

00:21:25
ROBBIN MILLER As I knew definitely would encourage people to talk to their doctors about that? 

00:21:25
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Oh yeah! It would be, you go to your general practitioner and tell him about your, your concerns about your erectile problems and he could either give you Viagra I would imagine, ah right from his office on his little prescription pad or if you need the injections, you need to go to a urologist that specializes in that and you need to be… ah you need to get the medication a certain dose in order that you don't keep your erection too long, because men can develop problems by having it for a prolonged period of time and that could be umm dangerous to them. 

00:22:00
ROBBIN MILLER And they could still, umm take these drugs or use I guess mechanical equipment if they have any catheter? 

00:22:05
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Oh yes. Yes. Yep. 

00:22:05
ROBBIN MILLER So, I guess will they take the catheter off? They have to use the pump? 

00:22:10
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, some men choose to remove their catheters when they have sex and have reinsert them if they can reinsert them themselves or can have their attendant or their partner reinsert them. Um, the question about using the vacuum devise with the catheter in place, I think it's pretty interesting, I'll have to check that out to really be able to give a firm response to that. 

00:22:30
ROBBIN MILLER Now, let's talk about woman about them gaining aroused. Do they need to use like a vibrator? If they, if for men, there are certain medications or they have no sensation. What do you recommend for woman? 

00:22:40
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, I recommend mostly that you find the spot that feels really good. It doesn't have to be in your groin. So look for the spot and I would recommend you practice and look for that very whole heartedly… 

00:22:50
ROBBIN MILLER The G spot. 

00:22:50
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, no the G spots internal, and there is a lot of controversy about whether that exist or not but, but if you have no clitoral it's more clitoris. So if you have no clitoral sensation, it can be problematic. If that's what you relied on to have orgasm, but then I would say explore other parts of your body. Give your partner to help explore and find other parts that feel just as good. Vibrators are used by both men and women and you know, and I encourage people to use them to find the spots that work well to bring them to orgasm if that's what you want. But woman tend, some woman with spinal cord injuries in particular and maybe multiple sclerosis and may have issues with getting, getting wet, getting lubricated. So, I always advice that you keep some KY jelly, it has to be water soluble lubricant at the bed side, um… because any type of petroleum based jelly will ball up and get stuck in your vagina and it's not easy to get out, can cause infection so, water soluble lubricants are the best. And KY jelly seems to the most. But if you go to any sex toy shop, you can pretty much find all types of water soluble lubricants and colors and tastes to meet your fancy. 

00:23:55
ROBBIN MILLER They have these places Worcester(ph) and (inaudible )? 

00:24:00
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Ah, there is one on Route 9. But I won't advertise it, but there is a shop on Route 9 in Worcester(ph), I think. 

00:24:05
ROBBIN MILLER I remember going to New York City and seeing the erotic bakery and erotica. But do you know (inaudible ) to me, when I read about that in the paper a few weeks ago, when they talked about the new New York, for a lot of business. 

00:24:20
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Yeah, well. I would've imagine there is not there many round. But you can find them if you need to look for sex toys. 

00:24:25
ROBBIN MILLER We can always use cyber space. 

00:24:25
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Yeah! All cyber space for sure. 

00:24:30
ROBBIN MILLER Okay, with a few minutes to go. I know we talked a little bit about sexuality and divisions and sensation, what about people, who just they can't feel any parts of their body. How do they… how do they get an orgasm? And what do you do? How do you teach them? 

00:24:40
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, there you can feel. There is, I don't there is any disability around maybe. Well, I don't think any real disability that prevents you from even feeling your face. I mean, it's been documented you know, not objectively documented, but people have told stories are given account(ph) case studies, where they have had orgasm of having their eyelashes licked or, or fluttered their ear lobes or on their necks. So, you don't need to have an orgasm that's genitally based. Or even your breast, your nipples. If you have sensation there I would suggest you, you work on those areas. That's what I tell my, my clients I guess. As I try to encourage them to self-stimulate um, while they are actually in hospital to find out what they can feel, what they can't feel. So, when they actually do have their first encounter with their, their loved one that they know where, where to go. We would tell like, kind of tell their partner to look at or to… to kind of stimulate, so they can become aroused. 

00:25:35
Miller Chat 

00:25:35
ROBBIN MILLER You know, there is one thing that I just note about ah… maybe we can quickly comment. We didn't discuss people with psychiatric issues. Is there any way that you'd teach sex to them? 

00:25:45
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, if they needed sex education, I could do sex education with them. It'd be just pretty much generic sex education, I would think, unless they are dating someone with a disability, which does happen. Uh, but mainly it would be more of medication issue as to what medications they're taking and whether that affects their libido and whether that affects their erectile capabilities and those types and their lubrication issues. 

00:26:10
ROBBIN MILLER Yeah. I was hearing today in the radio about (inaudible ). They're saying they have done studies saying that helps, well it doesn't help people with the sexual functions. So, that would be something you would discuss with them. 

00:26:15
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Yes. 

00:26:15
ROBBIN MILLER So probably they can use some of the, the tools like the vacuum pump or the vibrator for women, beside(ph)? 

00:26:25
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Yep. Whatever, whatever flirts you about. 

00:26:25
ROBBIN MILLER Ha ha ha… okay. Gay and lesbian? 

00:26:30
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Gay and lesbians, yes. Yes, I always I wanted to apologize for that, that my pictures were actually heterosexually based, but in no way do I mean to offend the gay community at all, yeah. 

00:26:40
ROBBIN MILLER Have you done some training with them or not? 

00:26:45
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Um, I've done sex ed(ph) with the individuals, who were gay or lesbians yes, I have. But I don't know of any written materials that I'm aware of that specifically. Oh! No! Yes, I do. Actually a friend of mine is, lives in, live in California, is a lesbian. She actually did a book on fantasies, sexual fantasies and there are some sexual fantasies that relate to women with disabilities within those stories. 

00:27:10
ROBBIN MILLER You know, before we, ah, we have another, another minute or so, I know we talked about, you know people being rehab hospitals and the taboo of not to say anything you know, you'll be talked about that in either in the part one series and even now. Is it even harder for women or man who was, who are gay once when they become newly disable because… 

00:27:25
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Oh, yeah. 

00:27:25
ROBBIN MILLER …either I guess, sort of further taboo, I guess. 

00:27:30
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, it's… it, I mean when you look at that just, just in general is that people who are gay or lesbian um, they don't have again, they don't have the role models as they are growing up, they are actually thought to hide their sexuality and they don't, they can't express it freely and when they became disabled there is not much literature there, or someone they can talk to and have a role model then either. It's… it's difficult. I believe, but you would have to ask I would suggest that to be probably in another show. 

00:28:00
ROBBIN MILLER Yeah, probably. 

00:28:00
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Yeah. 

00:28:00
