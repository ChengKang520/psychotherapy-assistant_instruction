00:00:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hi I am Lewis Schlosser I'm professor of counseling psychology at seen University with me today is Dr Will Liu He is a professor and training director of counseling psychology at University of Aiwa. Dr Liu one of his areas of research expertise is man and masculinity and were here to have a conversation about male privilege Dr. Liu thank you so much for joining us today. 

00:00:55
DR. WILLIAM LIU Glad to be here. 

00:00:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I think the first think to get started is just to share with our audience you were taken on what is male privilege? What does that mean? 

00:01:05
DR. WILLIAM LIU I think milk privilege you probably heard this I think lets get back to the foundational elements of were we can set a privilege which are unearned rights and if it is resources opportunities that are afforded it to you irrespective of anything you were return but are just there. Just there because you are in this regard, if you are man I think there are certain privileges that are out in the environment that people work here and much more positive assumptions given to man and to women, and specially if you are white if your are sexual if your are middle upper class. Those other layers of privilege keep coming. 

00:02:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So being a white male for example looking at the two of us both being man being and white male I will get more privilege because of white skin. Like the whiteness sort of enhances you know privilege and being the person of color might it any way in some situations your male privilege. 

00:02:15
DR. WILLIAM LIU I do think sir I do believe that there are certain assumptions that people have about somebody who might be physically racially white and those tend to be much more positive and then if you are racially I think manually one of the things that happen like classes one of the kinds of privileges that most men enjoy for instances and is lets say it's a dark street you are walking down for most man there isn't you not only think about your safety I don't know if its male stupidity that you know don't think about it or its just a privilege that I have you know you feel like your are going to be sexually assaulted which is incredibly important issue and you just don't that doesn't come to mind where the context changes very quickly in terms of privilege for instances is a police car comes down the street if you are a white man walking down the dark street your privilege is solidified. If you are a black man walking down the dark street your privilege is compromised you don't there are different assumptions that happen in that situations in a context changes very quickly the police car or a police officer in some ways could be a neutral different variable but it definitely changes the context of privileges of what's afforded. 

00:04:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And even if you think about if you were a black woman you might actually have a little bit more privilege in that dark lane than a black man because of the assumptions that the police officer may make your reasons for being there to in the morning in that dark street. What are some other I think concrete examples that can help our audience for wrap the hands around that you have to get the sort the whole how does male privilege manifests itself in our day to day life that things we can point to so people can see it. 

00:04:30
DR. WILLIAM LIU Well you know at a day to day level I think one of the male privileges might be that ah people tend to differ to the man and in any particular social (inaudible )and necessary sort of an innocuous example that should be if I am at dinner with my wife, my mother may be my sister -in- law and I am the only man at the table the servers always differ to me they always come to me and ask me for they look to me to give directions to who orders the things and that's the small kind of privilege those kind of day to day interactions can be mad deny and can be frustrating for if your are when you are a women in that situations and if you are a man in a sensitive too he can be frustrating as well. 

00:05:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Something you might call a micro-aggression. 

00:05:25
DR. WILLIAM LIU Its really a micro-aggression and I think we need to pay attention to these things and those are important. For me the those are in some ways less important than the privileges that are afforded to man with respect to access to power and other ways that really might have a different sort of effect on other peoples life. So friends since as a man and, and you know in certain environments I have taken note that I have been invited to be a part of social activities were there are no other woman involved, they are the men involved happened in any much more senior in positions of power and so I am much more able to provide my true sense my opinion and I am also being socialized into different positions of power as well and so that particular kind of privilege is much more important for me to recognize to be much more sensitive to work against or to work with interface than the sort of day to day in a personal interest and I don't mean to necessarily diminish it better I also don't want to get caught up with people talking necessarily about well you know we go here this happens and I am treated differently that's its frustrating I understand it that in some ways takes it discussions of a what the real privilege is what real privileges are and what they mean in terms of peoples life or lives. 

00:07:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I always think about an example from high school I went to dinner with a young woman named Sonialee who was Korean visibly agent and at dinner she asked for the bill at the end she was taking me out for my birthday and the server bought me the check and she took it and in front of the server she put the credit card down which says Sonialee and the server took and left in front of her so we took it from him in front of her and returned it to me and you know its possible that we have the credit card that to see that I might not look like Sonia Lee. 

00:07:40
DR. WILLIAM LIU Well this is the day to day interactions that we are assigned to kind of privileges that people afford it's the general narrative of privilege they are afforded to given to certain people just to because of you are. 

00:07:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER But as you say it need for a funny story for Sony and I but how much really is going to impact in our life versus having may be limited access to positions of break delicious positions of power yes it would be knowing and frustrating if it happens on a day to day basis. What is the impact on a persons life, other examples like that some one would be so access to power is another you think are more things you see are really important privileges for male privileges for works understand. 

00:08:25
DR. WILLIAM LIU I think one of the things that are I have become at more aware is that man are much more able to assert themselves without any kind of necessarily negative consequences related to it were able to serve as demand and were spotted to mostly in kind in terms of, if you want something we demand it and we got the position out there that we sound masculine were able to get through the things that the people might not or even if we are not given those opportunities and resources we are not given the attributions that we are shrill that were emotional all those are the kind of negative labels that attend to be given to other to women for instances that are necessarily given to men. And even if it was given to a man it doesn't stick like it does to a woman because that particular attribution. If some were to call me shrill it does not have the same kind of it does not stay with the native of masculine privilege that it does with the native of how most woman are described. 

00:09:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER All right this is the way you and I have talked about this previously about if you step outside of the way the society wants to view you. You give up some of those privileges and sort of see a man who doesn't be here through might not yet here to traditional masculine behaviors right being behaving more because he is femininely more you know those of the things when you then may be attenuating your privileges well. 

00:10:05
DR. WILLIAM LIU Exactly, exactly… yeah and I think one of the privileges that come to mind for me is that I feel much more if I am in a situation were I due feel like something goes wrong or I have been treated poorly I feel much more able to assert my self it to and to assert my privilege and to demand and to talk to somebody empower or authority to rectify this situation. But in the back of my mind in this goes to the issue of raise some racism I know that its still attenuated so I am much I am awesome very aware of how I am being perceived that I know that I am not a white man making this demand that I am an aged American man making this demand or sorting myself and how does this other individual respond to me. 

00:10:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So one of the things I also want a give you chance to talk about is a little bit of a sort of personal interest in the topic how you became interested in studying men and masculinity and seeing that as an area of research in (inaudible ) or professional interest and to help our audience try to sort to connect with the material. 

00:11:20
DR. WILLIAM LIU I it feels like for me it was a it came from college started really in college when I started taking my first age American studies class talked about the general issues and it was at a time when they what has been introduced to a different way to in a sense decode my environment to understand what's going on in my environment understands for instance the movies that I saw and much more aware of how each American man would be portrayed in that respect and for the most part of us are in way to arbitrary ways very passive ways and in a sense very non masculine so when you know I am thinking about the at this time it would have been serve the Post Vietnam war movies that came out and the, all the age American male actors were just faces in a crowd can never shoot straight can never do anything right you they were always a sort of killed of in mass and it was a just it from a way to look out how each American man would be portrayed in the media and that's what it stuck in my mind and in our respect of studies see myself differently in my environment started to see myself not just the man but Asian-American man how did that affect my interactions my relationships and I just took that to me to graduate school and started doing much more reunited and found that for most of the part no one had done any writing not lot of writing there are a few people out there Davidsoo and Deraldsoo and a little bit of work and Stanleysoo done a little bit of work that it really no concentrated areas of work in that got me interested and in my own personal life I think as I have moved on in my education and started teaching and getting from the class room I also recognized how other AsianAmerican college men responded to me they and I don't I think its very characterize that is the, as a kind of mental ship relationship even though who is very informal I would have a lot of guys come by my office just hang around just talk they want to get to know me and at one point I did asked you know why come around here and sit with me and chat one of the guys offered that I was the only other Asian adult that they knew other than their father and they don't want to be like their father so they really saw me as an Asian American man so they want. 

00:14:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER As a man of what they could do. 

00:14:20
DR. WILLIAM LIU As a different kind of masculine than their fathers and so I wanted to just talk to them about was yes I do potentially represent that a different kind of masculinity but how might you go about understanding what your fathers are going through when the kind of masculinity they have had they come to in order to potentially survive in an environment working in lower classes and working class environment for instance being a first generation immigrant not knowing the language having their vows the man and the father in the family diminished what kind of assaults they had to go through and what kind of things they have to do to, we cooperate that on masculinity and in that respect when I talk to clients that particular story or that particular native when I get to talk about it is general its universal and I don't necessarily think its unique just to Asian-American or African-American or Latin American men but I do think that a reconciling and understanding who I am with respect to my father right know about my father or masculine models in my life is a important discussion to engage in. 

00:15:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Was there any moment in your life that a sort of recognize that you have this male privilege despite you talked about the complexity of being and Asian American how that complexifies your privilege or (inaudible )certain circumstances. 

00:15:55
DR. WILLIAM LIU I would say that the most dramatic incidences of being aware of my own privilege have come with a bit of shame with a bit of sort of self recognition I am operating under some level of privilege and it might be for instance the way I engage other man talking about certain windings and research that tend to exclude female voices or of female part of the women participating in the conversation I know that I have been called on it and what I have tried to do is when I have been called on it to build into my own thinking take a breath what's going on and not react instinctively in a sense that I have been ashamed and really sort of think what's going on in here what did they try to communicate to me and how can I continue this conversation how I norm like the other person feel bad as well and engage in this conversation rather than just to react instinctively to push back to fight back. 

00:17:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So you are able to take the defensiveness and a sort of decided a bit that might have been more naturally elicited in a place where some one calls here and you cannot be committed the inside might be self-protective. 

00:17:20
DR. WILLIAM LIU Yes, yes and I think what I tried to do is and it's a sort of the soft talk that I have done with myself is a for the most part for me in most environment that I operate in a frequently I have a lot of privilege and I don't necessarily need to feel threatened there's nothing I can do to further make my to solidify my privilege my privilege is already there in other words you know I am a professor in a lot of programme and teaching students, I am a man, I am at this point of my life middle class educated so I have a lot of privileges that are given to me that protect me so my instant of heard to push back on somebody isn't going to help me in terms of reaffirming my own privilege I just have to be aware of hear somebody who is trying to communicate something to me that I have missed and how can I respond in a way that isn't diminishing, patronizing, dismissing, modulating to that of a person and recognizing that I really for most part exist in a very really fight environment very privileged environment and so when students call me on it, when my wife is commenting on it when my clients commenting on it as well I tried to take a moment take talks on what's going on and then find a place where I think to myself engage, engage, engage and so I am trying to find a way that to talk to that person rather than to deal with my own at that moment that hurt you know and so so that's really important for me. But it's… 

00:19:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So try to consider what they have to say this you know let me think about it lets talk about it instead of rejecting it in a defensive soft preserving. 

00:19:35
DR. WILLIAM LIU Right, but it's a soft talk I think I have had to develop over time and to be comfortable saying to myself because like I said in describing myself and my environment one of the privilege that I have is most people in those environment differed to me to think I am wild all the time so I am for the most are very accustomed when somebody says hey !you are wrong and so of course my first initial reaction would be as an intellectual matter to say no I am right I cannot be wrong and I want to really need to do is be less in my head and really be try to respond to the person who is calling me out on this privilege in a as a …but not is in my head but it serve in an emotional engagement with that person. 

00:20:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Are there any such case of that any sort of common misconceptions people might hold about male privilege things that they might think about not the actually the case… 

00:20:40
DR. WILLIAM LIU Ahh… I … I think the way we talked about male privilege in the past has been about people giving up and for feeding privilege and I just don't know how that would happen I think I don't necessarily believe that its something that you can just give up so you can educate somebody about the male privilege. but I don't see how anybody can just say I am not going to use that privilege its already given to you, the options that people have a man has is how they are going to use that privilege. Its already out there it's a matter of how you want to engage it and how we want to activate it and these are privilege…… am… 

00:21:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I mean how to enact to one time ad probably may be doing all the details properly, but there were some with you the study of conversation with faculty that they might be at a lab space, many of the faculty felt that there should be quality and gender in terms of lab space but none of the man were willing to give up the lab space that they have to achieve the gender acuity. 

00:21:45
DR. WILLIAM LIU Of course… of course… 

00:21:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER That's what we are speaking about the inability or willingness to give up. 

00:21:50
DR. WILLIAM LIU Well its its in one of the respect I do believe that people are unwilling to give up their privilege once you have something its hard to give it up… but the other part is I don't believe we can give it up not necessarily lets say the lap space but let us say as a man if somebody at the way a sort of privilege in the past as a sign of you aware it and I think the unconscious message has been you need to not use it and I don't know how you can not use that privilege in those environment. So people are forgo that privileges so for instance if a if we are using this dining example if some one were to give us the as soon for us give us the privilege of giving us the chat even though the woman sitting across from us is paying for it and always put the card down. One of the ways you can use that privilege differently is to assert yourself and say I appreciate you giving me the check back as well as the credit card but I wanted to know that I am not paying for it that these are the persons and so, and so using your privilege differently in those environments rather than a sort of oh! No not I was not experienced not interaction in sort of stepping out there and pushing back and using it (inaudible ) 

00:23:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Where were you when you was sixteen? 

00:23:25
DR. WILLIAM LIU You know what. ya… all those things I mean I say though its easy to do but one of the things that I have recognized and this goes back to an issue multi-cultural competency is people like myself talk about how these things are easy to do often when a competition is called in this question it happens in an instant that you are completely not ready for, and that's when the practice the internal dialogue being comfortable and being activated confidence is much more important I think, you got to ask me do I feel a competent and comfortable around about gender issues and gender column, sure, if I were in your situation I would probably responded differently the same way which is I think oh! What do I do here? And how I am going to respond so it in no ways it is an easy thing to do in many ways its more to talk about racism when it happens though it even when it happens to me its, it always happens in a way that catches me of I have never got prepared for it, never. I know I am prepared in the sense that I know it might happen, it's a possibility I am sensitive to it I know when racism does occur when it does happen? I… It completely dis winds so I never have this really great retort to response you know way of responding to completely disruins me so… it takes a lot of practice I think it takes a lot of agency on your part, a lot of self efficacy a lot of practice how you are going to respond to those situations even then I don't think we are really prepared because I think you like I said the when it comes to confidence issues around gender, around gender privilege, male privilege they always happen when you are least prepared for it. And in those instances that's when all that training has to happen. So… 

00:25:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Thank you. What ah… (inaudible ) what folks can and you know what we talked about, what it is and were you interested in and came from and how what can folks do about it does they able to identify privilege either in their lives or in the lives of the people that they care about or even working with clients. What can our professionals do about male privileges? Or what should they do about it? 

00:26:05
DR. WILLIAM LIU I think one of the things that we know from the research around men and masculinity is that ah one of the automatic one of those things that happen very automatically with lot of men is when they are called on something ah shame as immediately elicited and one of the things that we want to try to do is clinicians is to diminish the possibility of eliciting that particular shame, because I think for many men when that shame is elicited they shut down and it is difficult to engage in that dialogue again and for me it's a sort of protection mechanism and so I do believe that men are willing and able to talk about it there I think men are interested in understanding themselves and interested in understanding the impact on other people and I think a clinicians need to be sensitive to the ways that men want to communicate those experiences but in the ways that you want to engage them as well. It may not necessarily happen in a traditional counseling it may not be that great but you also look at the other ways that we might have clients talk about their own privilege their own experiences and when those things do come forward those experiences and those perceptions finding a way to frame it to help them learn from it not on one short but I think about these things as long term processes that when they come up we need to serve slowly adjust, slowly adjust, slowly adjust that for clinicians who might be social justice oriented or you know proceed themselves as multicultural competent, we want to do it all I think we need to resist that temptation to go out of the guy for on with everything that we have to try to change the perspective all at once I think. 

00:28:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Because if you come out on (inaudible ) as you are suggesting raise the shame who come up and the learning stops. 

00:28:15
DR. WILLIAM LIU I mean its like ay other client to me most learning once we get to a beyond certain age most learning comes with some ego(inaudible ) ego hurt right when we told that we are wrong and here is the right answer and so for many men they have learned automatically to go to the place of shame and that we want do is try to ah try to minimize and try to avoid it or rest rive to predict before them so that understand that this is what is going on for them that a privilege is out there that noting that they necessarily they did or do but its part of the general native of how men are socialize how to talk how to treat it and to be much more aware about of how they might want to engage in a situations differently in the future to be much more sensitive to their interpersonal interactions to be much more even aware of the situations were there are no other different voices that the tape might have or they engage in a way that potentially invites those different voices or use their privilege in a way that they can at least bring some different voices to an environment that more necessarily allowed so. 

00:29:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Are there any as we are going to wrap in up instead of take a messages you might have for the mental professionals or the trainees in the audience about just in general about male privilege and things like okay what you want me to remember after watching this video? You know what do I need to know about male privilege? 

00:29:55
DR. WILLIAM LIU Ahh… I… I… I have a sense that most men are unaware of their own privilege one of the great ways that society socializes men is to make them (inaudible ) to their power in some ways and their privilege not only but I think they are unaware of the fact on the privileges that they have afforded to them but I do believe that men want to talk about it that they are willing and interested to learn about themselves that they want to engage you in that conversation we as clinicians have to find a different way to approach that does not shame them does not elicit guilt from them to find ways in engaging men that how men relate to each other and understand that ironically the theories that we are operating in the dominant there is for dynamic hugging behavioral humanistic are generated by men but don't necessarily work with men and I think we need to find different ways to work with theories that are general concurrent for men. 

00:31:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Is there any other things you want me to ask that I didn't or the things you need to cover (inaudible ) issue of male privilege. 

00:31:30
DR. WILLIAM LIU Oh I think I have said everything I could to say thank you. 

00:31:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Oh well I want to thank you really very much for your time and sharing your expertise with us today. 

00:31:35
DR. WILLIAM LIU Thank you.
