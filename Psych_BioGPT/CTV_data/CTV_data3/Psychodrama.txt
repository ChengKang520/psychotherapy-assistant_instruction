ZERKA MORENO But I'm not glad about the fact that I can't see you and you can see me and I can't see you and that's not only unpsychodramatic, it's undemocratic. This is one of the worst possible settings for an intimate psychodrama and we need to keep that in mind, that we're working with some disabilities here. First of all, these electrical umbilicas (ph) here. Um, each of you will be tied to it, whoever comes up to work. Um, I hope that some of you saw my demonstration the other day, difficult as it was, the large setting, that was still better than this. My eyes are beginning to get used to the dark a little bit. Okay. Considering all these difficulties, let's just see if we can learn something together. How many people here know something about psychodrama? Well, every time I ask this question in a group, it gets a few larger number, bigger numbers. So that's nice. If I were to lecture to you about psychodrama, that would take most of the hour. How's the sound, by the way? So I'm just going to say that the term psychodrama means the, the mind in action. Instead of telling me your story, I turn you into an improvising actor and you show me. We come from Missouri in other words. Don't tell me, show me. The reason for having action, according to Moreno (ph) is because we need to say why we're doing this, why are we not just dialoguing with the patient and talking to the patient and he has a scientific reason for that. From the point of view of the individual and the point of view of the race, philogenetically and autogenetically, speech is a fairly late development in the human being. Most of you have started to speak by the time you're approximately two years old but you know what? You've been living intensely and learning enormously in those first two years. Those first two years have laid the basis for much of who you become later on. And Moreno did not believe that speech was the royal root into the psyche, that the psycho, psyche cannot be absorbed like a sponge through speech and so he wanted to reach a more primordial level and one, one of the reasons why he was so interested in this was because he loved to work with children and with psychotics and, as you know, they don't live in the same world you and I live in. I have to tell you that when, um, my, my son was small, I began to work with him psychodramatically. If you ever meet him, don't tell him I told you this. When he was five months old, at about a time when children begin to experience themselves as somewhat separate from the rest of the world, if you've watched a baby, they begin to sort of play with their hands, look at them, and touch their feet and they begin to babble. Beautiful music. He was lying on his blanket and I laid down with him and became a baby. Took my shoes off, took my stockings off and did exactly what he did as well as using his sound and you know something? We talked to each other in Jonathan language and we told each other the most astounding cosmic fairy tales. I've never told any fairy tales like that since then. It was mostly about how different it was down here from where we came from and how funny these people were around us and we laughed. We laughed. Laughter's a wonderful healing thing, isn't it? Now I don't want to go through the whole development with you but I want to tell you that I became very imbued with the idea that Moreno was absolutely right. Two central characteristics of the human being, according to him, which are the most important is spontaneity and creativity, a twin principle and, you know, spontaneity in our culture is not admired in children the way intelligence, motor control, memory, even speech. But spontaneity we don't understand. You know why? And we don't, we fear it. We fear it because it's unpredictable and man feared fire until he could control it and look at what happened in Los Alamos recently, right? We think we can control our world. Our educational system is all wrong. We take away a child's creativity and we expect them to sit or in, in a seat. Do you remember what it was like the first time you went to school and had to sit and not move about? I had a school mate, and I went to school when I was six. I had a class mate who didn't sit down for two days in the class. When the teacher asked her why don't you sit down, she said I'm not tired. She hadn't learned the role of the student in the classroom. The role of the student is, you sit and only the teacher's allowed to walk about. Look at me. You're sitting there and, and I'm the one that's talking to you. You are roleplayers from the moment you are born. There isn't a person in this room here who hasn't been told by his mother or her mother one day, don't you talk to your mother like that. I'm your mother. You're my child. That establishes a very distinct set of role interactions, right from the beginning. Well, I can talk about roles for the rest of the day and it would always be fascinating. What I hope to do was to do a fairly simple demonstration. I only have one hour. That's not the average length of a psychodrama. I would say the average good length, I mean, you can do it in an hour but you feel pressed for time and you have to cut it down to the bone. Sometimes we do what we call a vignette. A vignette is a short story that is one scene which you show as it happened with all the involved, people involved and how it hurt you and who hurt you and in what way. Then we redo it. We take you to the magic as if. How should this have been for you? And that's where the healing comes in. Now a lot of people, you know, sniff their noses at, you know, well that's only wish fulfillment. What do you mean by only, only wish fulfillment? Do you know how much energy we spend thinking about the if onlys? If only that, I hadn't just sent that letter. If only I hadn't forgotten to make that phone call. If only I hadn't, had made that phone call or hadn't made that phone call, hadn't written that letter or had written the letter. I mean, the, we're full of, if only I'd gone to see that person before that person died. Right? The if onlys. They take a lot of our emotional energy and they keep us away from what's happening in front of us. Well, I think maybe the simplest way to teach you a very vital aspect of how we function in psychodrama, it's called, which I call role reversal. There are actually two levels for the person to feel themselves into another person. One is called doubling. Let me tell you again quickly the, the instruments in psychodrama. The, quickly, the director, the protagonist, central figure of the drama, the auxiliary egos, therapeutic actors, the group, and the setting. We, Moreno designed his own theater and it's small and intimate and very different from this. Maybe one day you can come and see it. It's still extend. Well, these auxiliary egos go into interaction with the protagonist when the director stayed outside to organize and synthesize the drama and the auxiliary egos are trained to use what we call their (inaudible ), their empathic feeling into another person, into the reality of that other person, as a double, which means externalizing the internal feelings and thoughts, mostly feelings and in role reversal, taking the role of the other while the other takes the role of them, of themselves. You can be role reversing with a protagonist when the protagonist is in a, in a heated battle with a mother or a father or a lover or husband and suddenly the director will say role reverse to the protagonist. The protagonist takes the role of the other and the auxiliary has to move into the role of the protagonist. Now that's a simplification. There are many modifications with this. Moreno used the double a great deal because he worked with psychotic patients and they, as you know, they live in a bizarre world, incomprehensible to most of us. By having an auxiliary extension of himself who enters unto the psyche of that patient, then begin, that, that protagonist can begin to be understood, to have a companion into the psyche and what happens is that when you become an auxiliary ego, you can begin to interpret the protagonist to the director in a way which makes sense. You can convey the psychodramatic (inaudible ) now of that patient to the director. What I, I, role reversal, you know, most, developmentally, doubling comes before role reversal and I doubled with my son a great deal when he was little. It has been found that autistic children respond to this, by the way. Parents taking on the role of the child, non critically accepting, embracing, giving it right, right and respect to be heard and seen and very often the child is able to make the bridge to the other person and we've done this with mute longstanding schizophrenic patients as well to bring them out. First silently. That's doubling. More complicated is role reversal. Role reversal, in the beginning of psychodrama, was done only with the real persons present. Two people being treated together and jointly. Mother and child. Wife and husband and so on. And so when you role reverse, we found that it's often very difficult for the other partner to stay in the role of the other. It kept putting in their own ego, falling out of the role and so we used the therapeutic actors who could maintain the distance to the role and present the husband or the wife in a more objective fashion and often it is done as the beginning of treatment until the real, each, each of them working with auxiliary egos until they are ready to confront each other. Well, let me explain role reversal and why it's more complicated. Existentially, you are yourself. Psychodramatically, you have taken on the identity of the other, right? The role. And you're facing yourself in the other person who's taken your role but who's existentially him or herself. See how complicated it gets? I want to tell you that I brought my psychotic older sister to Moreno. This is how I met Moreno. This is how I became trained in psychodrama and he had us work together on the stage. We had problems that could not be resolved by dialoguing about them and we worked them out on stage through role reversal. I became her. She became me. It worked. So what I'd like to teach you today is role reversal and a very simple way which most of you can learn is to ask you, all of you, I can only work with one person and auxiliary egos, remember? And everyone who comes up, by the way, has to sign a release. Remember that, hmm, before you come up. I'd like you to close your eyes and you can play this game yourself when you're gone from here. I'd like you to close your eyes and think of a family photograph. Family photograph that you like, that you're attached to in some way, that has a meaning for you. I would prefer, because we only have so few minutes, to work with a family photograph that has not too many people in it. Say not, not more than three or four because we then have to use the auxiliary egos and it gets complicated in this space, okay? And we have mics and so on. So think of a photograph. It can be black or white, black and white or color. Think where it is and think of what it looks like. Try and recall it and what it means to you and who these, who these people are and what they mean to you. People in the picture. And then I'd like to have a volunteer come up and show us but remember, I'd like to, if possible, restrict the number of people to four. It gets much too lengthy and complicated if we have more than people, four, a few people up here with this electronic equipment. It doesn't mean you can't do it with larger groups. I've done it with one man from India who had 21 family members in his photograph. Learning to role reverse with 21 members of your family is really quite something. If you have someone, come up. If someone has, comes to the side, that'll be very helpful. Some of you who would like to be actors may want to offer yourselves as auxiliary egos or we will, if the protagonist can choose, if she can see you, she may be able to choose. You understand the function of the auxiliary ego is to make yourself available, to empty your psyche and make yourself available to play whatever role is required by the protagonist. Come on up. 

00:16:15
[sil.] 

00:16:15
ZERKA MORENO Um, that's difficult. Who was the first? 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN She was. 

00:16:30
ZERKA MORENO How many do you have? 

00:16:30
CHRISTY I have, I have three that I wanted to work on. Me and my husband and son. 

00:16:35
ZERKA MORENO That sounds fine. That sounds the right number. Yes, that sounds fine. Good. Well thank you all. Uh, how many people do you need? Two other? Do you want to choose two other people to be your helpers? They have, don't come up yet. Who would you like to, look at them and who would you like to represent eventually your son and your husband? And remember that women can play the role of men and men can play the role of women. It's wonderful that you're so willing to work and I wish I were here three months or so and could work with you all but we'd have a Arabian, pyschodramatically Arabian Nights. 

00:17:05
CHRISTY My son. 

00:17:05
ZERKA MORENO Okay. 

00:17:05
CHRISTY And, and my husband. 

00:17:05
ZERKA MORENO You need a husband. 

00:17:10
CHRISTY I think I'll call the big guy. 

00:17:10
ZERKA MORENO With the dark shirt? Or which.... 

00:17:10
CHRISTY Yes. 

00:17:10
ZERKA MORENO Good. Thank you all very much, uh, people. I'm sorry. There were just, there would just have had to have psychodrama every day I guess. The others should sit down and only the people who sign. You need, you need an, a lady, yes, to represent you for a moment too. 

00:17:25
CHRISTY Oh, I need a lady? 

00:17:25
ZERKA MORENO Fine. 

00:17:25
UNKNOWN She gonna be the lady? 

00:17:30
UNKNOWN Can I be a lady? 

00:17:30
ZERKA MORENO One lady to represent my protagonist yeah. Yeah. We may need one lady because you may, yeah. 

00:17:35
UNKNOWN She, she represents me? 

00:17:40
ZERKA MORENO Yeah. 

00:17:40
UNKNOWN That's fine. I didn't know that you needed... 

00:17:45
ZERKA MORENO That's okay. Everybody signed in? All right. Come on up. Now I'd like the auxiliary egos to stay, not on the stage. If you could stay on the side until we're ready for you. It's her stage and it's her picture and we have to respect that, okay? So can you get yourselves seats here or sit down there? Okay. Come on up, dear. You need to be miked. 

00:18:10
CHRISTY This thing? 

00:18:15
ZERKA MORENO Yeah. And there's another, um, portable mic if we need it. 

00:18:20

00:21:25
ZERKA MORENO Not probably. It either is or isn't on the picture. 

00:21:30

00:21:45
CHRISTY No. And I have a watch, a gold watch. 

00:21:50
ZERKA MORENO Okay, are you smiling in the picture? 

00:21:50
CHRISTY Yes. 

00:21:50
ZERKA MORENO Okay. Let's bring our auxiliary ego. Come on up. You will represent... 

00:22:00
CHRISTY Christy. 

00:22:00
ZERKA MORENO Christy. Pose her the way you stand in the picture. Are you sitting or standing? 

00:22:05
CHRISTY I'm sitting. 

00:22:05
ZERKA MORENO Okay. What kind of chair do you have? 

00:22:10
CHRISTY Eh, it's probably just one of those... 

00:22:10
ZERKA MORENO Well, look around and see. Can you use one of those? 

00:22:15
CHRISTY Yeah, you can use one of those chairs. 

00:22:15
ZERKA MORENO Okay. Shall we bring it forward? You set the scene. 

00:22:15
CHRISTY Should I set it up this way or do you want her, me to set it that way? 

00:22:20
ZERKA MORENO So that they can see it. 

00:22:20
CHRISTY So that they can see her? 

00:22:25
ZERKA MORENO Right. 

00:22:25
CHRISTY Then we'll set it over here. Okay. So she's right here. 

00:22:30
ZERKA MORENO Okay. 

00:22:30
CHRISTY Right there. 

00:22:30
ZERKA MORENO Would you show her how she's sitting? 

00:22:35
CHRISTY Yes. Sit down. 

00:22:35
ZERKA MORENO The protagonist will show you how. 

00:22:35
CHRISTY Nice. Stiff. Uncomfortable. 

00:22:40
ZERKA MORENO (crosstalk) No, no, no. You sit. You sit. 

00:22:40
CHRISTY Oh, okay. 

00:22:40
ZERKA MORENO (crosstalk inaudible[00:22:41). We are actors, remember? 

00:22:40
CHRISTY Okay. 

00:22:40
ZERKA MORENO We show in action. How long is your skirt? How long is your skirt? 

00:22:45
CHRISTY The skirt's about, about here. 

00:22:45
ZERKA MORENO All right. Sorry you're not wearing a skirt but it's okay. 

00:22:50
CHRISTY Okay. 

00:22:50
ZERKA MORENO Should she take her glasses off? 

00:22:50
CHRISTY Well, she, could, if she can see, yeah, and not trip. 

00:22:55
ZERKA MORENO Would you mind taking your glasses? You're not gonna be moving around a lot here so don't worry. And let's see if that's correct, the way. Is that right? 

00:23:00
CHRISTY Not like that exactly. More relaxed but yes and then you're looking this way, smiling. A nice, stiff smile. 

00:23:10
ZERKA MORENO Where is the photographer? 

00:23:10
CHRISTY The photographer's over here. 

00:23:15
ZERKA MORENO Is it male or female? 

00:23:15
CHRISTY Female. 

00:23:15
ZERKA MORENO Okay, who's next? 

00:23:15
CHRISTY Um, my little boy. 

00:23:20
ZERKA MORENO Put yourself in his position. 

00:23:20
CHRISTY Okay. 

00:23:20
ZERKA MORENO And take the role of your son. Have you ever been in the role of your son? 

00:23:25
CHRISTY Uh, well, many times. 

00:23:25
ZERKA MORENO Hmm? 

00:23:25
CHRISTY Especially when I argue with him. Yes, I get into it good. 

00:23:30
ZERKA MORENO Okay, do you role reverse with him actually? 

00:23:30
CHRISTY I don't do it on purpose. 

00:23:35

ZERKA MORENO Would you like a, uh, a baby brother or sister or an older brother or sister, do you think? 

00:25:05
CHRISTY No. 

00:25:05
ZERKA MORENO You're happy to be the only child? Are you hoping they won't have another one? 

00:25:10
CHRISTY (crosstalk) I want a four year old brother, right now. That's all. 

00:25:10
ZERKA MORENO You just want to be four years old and you want a, a brother that's also four?

CHRISTY Yes. 

00:25:15
ZERKA MORENO You'd like to have a twin, in fact?

00:25:20
ZERKA MORENO But no brother or sister? 

00:25:25
CHRISTY Well, yeah, a brother would be fine. 

00:25:25
ZERKA MORENO Oh, brother.

00:25:30
CHRISTY Yes. 

00:25:30
ZERKA MORENO You didn't come full grown four year old. 

00:25:35
CHRISTY That's true. 

00:25:35
ZERKA MORENO It's true but I understand. Babies are troublesome, aren't they? 

00:25:40
CHRISTY Yes. 

00:25:40
ZERKA MORENO Take a lot of attention from mom. 

00:25:40
CHRISTY Yes.

00:25:45
CHRISTY Yes. 

00:25:45
ZERKA MORENO Okay. Fine. Let's bring the husband up here now. And let us bring your son up here first. 

00:25:50
CHRISTY Okay. 

00:25:50
ZERKA MORENO You make yourself as small as you can. Good, that's very good. We often do that. Look, he's, he's already psychodramatic. Excellent. Very good. 

00:26:00
UNKNOWN Should I sit? 

00:26:05
ZERKA MORENO Well, uh, should he be on the floor to make him smaller or do you want him on the chair? You tell him. 

00:26:10
CHRISTY Um. 

00:26:10
ZERKA MORENO On the chair's probably easier 'cuz it's more comfortable. 

00:26:10
CHRISTY (crosstalk) Yeah, I want you to sit on the chair, but like lean over. You gotta go like this. 

00:26:10
ZERKA MORENO (crosstalk inaudible ). 

00:26:14
CHRISTY And your hands together up like this though, 'cuz he got all excited in the picture. 

00:26:15
ZERKA MORENO It's good to have (inaudible ). We, we need very few props, actually, in psychodrama but it's good to have chairs of different heights 'cuz that does help. And, look, is that the way he looks? 

00:26:30
CHRISTY Well a little up higher, like this. It's uncomfortable but he goes. 

00:26:30
ZERKA MORENO Uh-huh. 

00:26:35
CHRISTY No, right here. 

00:26:35
ZERKA MORENO Is he, is he touching mommy? 

00:26:35
CHRISTY Yeah, that's about, except he's back more. 

00:26:40
ZERKA MORENO (crosstalk) Is he closer? 

00:26:40
CHRISTY He's back up more. A little bit like that. 

00:26:40
ZERKA MORENO Good. All right. 

00:26:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:26:48
ZERKA MORENO You may stop for a minute if it's gonna be hard for you to hold this for a minute. All right. Now let's bring your husband up. 

00:26:55
CHRISTY Okay. 

00:26:55
ZERKA MORENO Where is he sitting? 

00:26:55
CHRISTY Should I show you first? 

00:26:55
ZERKA MORENO Yeah. 

00:26:55
CHRISTY Okay. 

00:26:55
ZERKA MORENO Another chair? 

00:26:55
CHRISTY Let me get from back this way. It might be better. No, I don't need a chair. 

00:27:00
ZERKA MORENO Oh, you stand? 

00:27:00
CHRISTY He, I'm standing. 

00:27:05
ZERKA MORENO That's right. You're standing. What does your pose imply? 

00:27:10
CHRISTY I am the man of the household. 

00:27:15
ZERKA MORENO Right. 

00:27:15
CHRISTY I, I'm the protector of these two. 

00:27:20
ZERKA MORENO So you are. So you are. Are you, uh, are you happy to be the protector of these two? 

00:27:25
CHRISTY Yes, that's my role here. 

00:27:25
ZERKA MORENO Uh, tell me, are you, is your wife a working mother? 

00:27:35
CHRISTY Yes she is. 

00:27:35
ZERKA MORENO What does she work at? 

00:27:35
CHRISTY Well, she's a professor at a university and she is a, uh, therapist. 

00:27:40
ZERKA MORENO Mm-hmm. And you? 

00:27:40
CHRISTY I run a business. 

00:27:45
ZERKA MORENO Uh-huh. Do you have any dreams for your son? 

00:27:45
CHRISTY Yes. I want him to grow up to be happy and independent and I want him to think for himself and not be a stupid person and I want him to be whoever he wants to be and have common sense as well as educational sense. 

00:28:05
ZERKA MORENO Wow, you have high expectations for him. He's only four years old. Give him a chance. Give him time to play. But I understand. How are you dressed, by the way? 

00:28:10
CHRISTY Um, I have on a blue suit and I have on a Christmas tie and a white shirt. 

00:28:15
ZERKA MORENO (crosstalk) Now what, what does your Christmas tie look like? 

00:28:20
CHRISTY It's got a picture of Santa Claus and it's got a red back, kind of red and greenish with Santa Claus in there. 

00:28:25
ZERKA MORENO Aha. Okay. Fine. Well now we need a photographer and I tell you what I'd like to do. Bring up husband. And you all go into your pose, please and you are king of the castle. Is that the, is that the right look? 

00:28:45
CHRISTY Well he needs to smile. 

00:28:50
ZERKA MORENO (Crosstalk) Is that the right look? 

00:28:50
CHRISTY He has to smile with his teeth. 

00:28:50
ZERKA MORENO (crosstalk) He has to smile. 

00:28:50
CHRISTY We all have teeth showing. 

00:28:50
ZERKA MORENO Would you be the, would you be the, the, the photographer? 

00:28:55
CHRISTY Oh, gosh. She was, she was horrible. 

00:29:00
ZERKA MORENO What kind of camera are you using? 

00:29:00
CHRISTY I'm using one of those ones that's you know, up to here and then it's got a black thing over it and aiming it like that. 

00:29:05
ZERKA MORENO Tell me, as you're looking at this, at these people, what do you see? 

00:29:10
CHRISTY Loosen up a little bit. You're all tense. Forget the fact that it was pouring rain outside on the way in here and your hair's not all, all nice. Be happy despite the fact of how tense it was, to get your son into that outfit and not get dirty on the way over here. Force merriment on yourself. 

00:29:30
ZERKA MORENO Do you think this is a happy family? Does it represent a happy family to you? 

00:29:35
CHRISTY Well he looks really happy. He's all excited. 

00:29:40
ZERKA MORENO He's all excited. Uh-huh. 

00:29:40
CHRISTY They're tense. 

00:29:40
ZERKA MORENO Well, give your instructions and take the picture. 

00:29:45
CHRISTY Okay. Look over here. 

00:29:45
ZERKA MORENO She is doing funny things. 

00:29:50
CHRISTY Look at Elmo. Say hi. Oops. He blinked his eyes. We have to do it over again. All right. Let's try it again. Wait a second. Okay. Not so stiff. Just smile naturally. Just smile naturally. Okay. Okay. She needs to do something. They need to do something and say something to her. 

00:30:20
ZERKA MORENO You want to reverse a minute? 

00:30:20
CHRISTY Yeah, I need to be, I need to be her. 

00:30:25
ZERKA MORENO Stand up. Get up. You need to be her. Okay. You, you're the photographer now. Yep. 

00:30:30
CHRISTY Um, he's not a baby. I think... 

00:30:30
ZERKA MORENO Will you do that please? Please photographer. You do ah. You get him... 

00:30:35
CHRISTY He's not a baby. He might do better if you don't do all that stuff. Just like say something funny. Don't, don't be waving all this stuff. You know? Just let him, you know, smile naturally. Don't, you know, don't do all that stuff. Okay? Let's see if that'll work better. 

00:30:45
ZERKA MORENO Okay, let's do that. You momma. You protect your child from all this nonsense. No, you tell her. You tell her exactly, you tell her exactly, you do your silly thing. You, you do you silly stuff. She has to protect him. 

00:31:05

00:31:15
CHRISTY Okay, well, look at the picture. Do you like it? 

00:31:20
ZERKA MORENO You have to reverse roles. She... 

00:31:25
CHRISTY It's a little forced, isn't it? Let's try it again. 

00:31:30
ZERKA MORENO Try it again. It's a little forced. 

00:31:30
CHRISTY Say Mickey Mouse. 

00:31:30
UNKNOWN Mickey Mouse. 

00:31:30
CHRISTY How's that? 

00:31:35
ZERKA MORENO Oh, reverse roles. There's certain questions the others can't, the protagonist can only answer, not the. You ask. How's that? 

00:31:40
UNKNOWN How is it? 

00:31:40
CHRISTY Uh, I guess it's okay. What do you think? 

00:31:45
UNKNOWN It's good. 

00:31:45
CHRISTY It's okay. Yeah, we're both, we're all smiling at least and... 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN You wanna go with this one then? 

00:31:50
CHRISTY I guess we'll go for that one. 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:31:50
ZERKA MORENO Thanks very much. For a moment, your, your task is done but keep, stay aside 'cuz we may need you. Off the stage. Now, we're going to psychodramatize this now. 

00:32:00
CHRISTY Okay. 

00:32:00
ZERKA MORENO Um, what is the message you are getting from your son? What is the subliminal message you get when you're in interaction with him in life? Just the essential feature of it. 

00:32:15
CHRISTY In general? 

00:32:15
ZERKA MORENO Yeah. 

00:32:15
CHRISTY He... 

00:32:15
ZERKA MORENO Be, take his role. Reverse roles. 

00:32:20
CHRISTY Oh. 

00:32:20
ZERKA MORENO And get, go over there. 

00:32:20
CHRISTY Be him? 

00:32:20
ZERKA MORENO You are now, Jerry? 

00:32:25
CHRISTY Gerrard. 

00:32:25
ZERKA MORENO Hmm? 

00:32:25
CHRISTY Gerrard. Gerrard. 

00:32:25
ZERKA MORENO Gerrard, excuse me. Gerrard. What is your message to you mother? What is your essential life message to your mother? 

00:32:35
CHRISTY Uh, I just wanna have fun and play and do stuff I like. 

00:32:40
ZERKA MORENO Fine. All right. Go back. You hold, no, in a minute you can do that. Move over. Okay. 

00:32:45
CHRISTY Oh. 

00:32:50
ZERKA MORENO Be your husband and husband be her for a minute. We are teaching, you may sit, Gerrard, as Gerrard. You may sit. What is the essential message you, what's your name? 

00:33:00
CHRISTY Jerry. 

00:33:00
ZERKA MORENO Oh, Jerry. Are giving Christy? Your wife. 

00:33:05
CHRISTY What am I giving her? 

00:33:05
ZERKA MORENO Yeah. What is the, the you know, it's, it's the unspoken message. 

00:33:10
CHRISTY Okay. You might be well educated and have all these years of experience and education but you don't got any common sense. 

00:33:20
ZERKA MORENO All right. 

00:33:25
CHRISTY Pay attention to the family. If your work's too hard for you, then don't work so hard. 

00:33:30
ZERKA MORENO (crosstalk) Okay. Thanks very much. Get up and now you sit there as yourself. 

00:33:30
CHRISTY Okay. 

00:33:30
ZERKA MORENO And listen to the messages. Just listen. Don't respond yet. Okay, go ahead. Give her the message. 

00:33:40
UNKNOWN I just wanna play. 

00:33:40
ZERKA MORENO You're more excited. 

00:33:40
UNKNOWN I just wanna play and have fun. I'm only four years old. I'm just a little kid. 

00:33:45
ZERKA MORENO (crosstalk) More, more excited. Move your hands. 

00:33:45
UNKNOWN I just wanna have fun. I wanna do what I wanna do and have fun. 

00:33:50
CHRISTY Yeah, I know. 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN Well, why can't I? 

00:33:55
CHRISTY You can. We have fun all the time. 

00:33:55
UNKNOWN Why do I have to go like this and wear these shoes? 

00:33:55
CHRISTY Well, that's... 

00:34:00
UNKNOWN Why do I have to do that? 

00:34:00
CHRISTY As soon as we're done with this picture, then you can, then we can play and have fun. 

00:34:05
ZERKA MORENO This is not your son and you're not gonna hurt his feelings. That's why we use auxiliary egos. What would you like to be able to say to your son at this point? 

00:34:15
CHRISTY You need to control yourself a little bit. Sometimes it gets annoying. You can annoy people sometimes 'cuz you get too excited and loud and some people find that annoying. 

00:34:25
ZERKA MORENO Okay. Listen to the message from friend husband. 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN You know, I, I'd like you to have just a little more common sense. I mean, come on. Just a little more common sense on day to day situations and stuff like that. It's the least I can expect of you. 

00:34:40
ZERKA MORENO Can you hear? 

00:34:40
AUDIENCE Yeah. 

00:34:45
ZERKA MORENO Can, can they hear? I don't know. Are they saying they can hear or? 

00:34:50
CHRISTY They can hear. 

00:34:50
ZERKA MORENO All right. I'm losing it too. 

00:34:50
UNKNOWN You act like you're real embarrassed to say it. 

00:34:55
ZERKA MORENO All right. Just, just what do you, would you like to respond to him? 

00:35:00
CHRISTY Well I do have common sense but, yeah, I don't pay attention to every little single detail like you on everything. I'm, you know, um, I'm not as detail oriented as you and I appreciate that you are willing to do all the detail oriented things for me and, um, you know, that's why I have you. Be happy that you, we complement each other like that. 

00:35:20
ZERKA MORENO All right. 

00:35:20
CHRISTY I know he, he doesn't like it when I play the... 

00:35:25
ZERKA MORENO Tell him. 

00:35:25
CHRISTY Oh. I know you don't like it when I play the absent minded professor routine but I really am absent minded 'cuz I got so much going on all the time and it's hard for me to do everything all the time. 

00:35:35
ZERKA MORENO Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Now, the picture doesn't change but the messages should change. You want different messages. Role reverse with your son again. Okay. I want you now to work yourself into your son with the message you would like to hear from your son, not the one you receive but the one you would like to receive. What would you like to hear from your son. 

00:36:10
CHRISTY I love you mommy and daddy and I'm happy in my home and I, you guys give me so much time to play and you, you help me read and you make me smart and you make me well-rounded and I would really like to start becoming a more of an outside boy and do more sports and activities outdoors, even though I don't like to. 

00:36:30
ZERKA MORENO Good. Remember your message. Be your husband. 

00:36:35
CHRISTY Oh. 

00:36:35
ZERKA MORENO And... 

00:36:35
CHRISTY Be my husband? 

00:36:35
ZERKA MORENO No, you sit down, you sit down as the boy. 

00:36:40
CHRISTY (crosstalk) As my husband. 

00:36:40
ZERKA MORENO Husband, come back here. You're Christy for a minute. Mm-hmm. 

00:36:45
CHRISTY I appreciate so much all the hard work you do and boy it sure is lovely to have a woman as intelligent and, as you are and I'm glad I can do some of the stuff that you can't do. It just gives me a special function and importance in this family. 

00:37:00
ZERKA MORENO Reverse roles. You know your messages. Let her hear the messages that she wants to hear. Okay? You can invent some of it yourself because you're a child. 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN Mommy, how did a boy like me ever deserve to have parents like you? I am so blessed and so unappreciative of everything you do for me. Even at four years old, I now understand that, that you are everything I could possibly want and it's been my lack of appreciation and understanding of all I could do for me, but really so much for you and I'm gonna try so hard because you deserve it more than any other mommy in the entire world who's ever lived. 

00:37:55
ZERKA MORENO Worth a hug, isn't it? 

00:38:00
CHRISTY Aw, sweetie. I love you. 

00:38:05
UNKNOWN Gee, it's great to have such a wonderful wife and it makes me feel so good that there's something I can contribute to the household. Some things that you aren't quite as good at, I can bring to the marriage and I, it makes me feel good and it's great to have such a wonderful wife. 

00:38:25
CHRISTY Aww. And actually, they do say stuff like that periodically. 

00:38:35
ZERKA MORENO They do say it, periodically? 

00:38:35
CHRISTY Yeah. 

00:38:35
ZERKA MORENO Sometimes they forget them. 

00:38:35
CHRISTY Yeah. A lot of times, they don't and... 

00:38:40
ZERKA MORENO Would you like to have a different kind of photograph this time? Would you like this photograph to be a little bit more easy? You look, you all look a little bit overdone, didn't you? 

00:38:45
CHRISTY Okay. Yeah. 

00:38:45
ZERKA MORENO Yeah. So let's see what kind of a photograph you'd like. Let's send the photography lady back again now and let's see what kind of expression do you want your son to have? Role reverse with him again. Role reverse with him, yeah. 

00:39:00
CHRISTY Oh, be him? 

00:39:00
ZERKA MORENO If you had the, a more realistically appreciable picture, how would you like your son to be in this picture? 

00:39:10
CHRISTY Um. 

00:39:10
ZERKA MORENO How would you like him to look? 

00:39:10
CHRISTY Let's see. 

00:39:10
ZERKA MORENO Gerrard. How do you look? Mm-hmm. 

00:39:15
CHRISTY I don't know. That's it. 

00:39:20
ZERKA MORENO Just more relaxed, huh? 

00:39:20
CHRISTY Mm-hmm. 

00:39:20
ZERKA MORENO Okay. Good. Can you see it? Okay. Reverse roles. And how would you like your husband to be? Come over here and watch it. Come, husband, come over here. 

00:39:35
CHRISTY Um, oh. 

00:39:35
ZERKA MORENO And watch. 

00:39:40
CHRISTY Um. 

00:39:40
ZERKA MORENO Look what she's doing. 

00:39:40
CHRISTY Let's see. Let's, well, this is silly but you'd never do it but this is how it would be cool. 

00:39:45
ZERKA MORENO What? 

00:39:45
CHRISTY Can you sit back a little? Or you have to watch me but, this is funny. 

00:39:50
ZERKA MORENO You wouldn't have your hand on, on them? 

00:39:50
CHRISTY Yeah, I'm gonna do it now but it's, okay. 

00:39:55
ZERKA MORENO (crosstalk) How would... Different from the way it was? 

00:39:55
CHRISTY Yeah. 

00:39:55
ZERKA MORENO Well embrace them then. 

00:39:55
CHRISTY Okay. 

00:39:55
ZERKA MORENO All right. Very good. All right. Okay. And you're there. How would you like to, uh, put, feel your husband's arm around you and do, the, the little boy, you know, close to you. 

00:40:10
UNKNOWN Wait, wait. 

00:40:10
CHRISTY Wait, he has to get in the middle. 

00:40:15
UNKNOWN I know. [00:40 :20] Hey Oedipus. 

00:40:15
ZERKA MORENO Would you take that picture please? 

00:40:25
ZERKA MORENO I'd like you to see this yourself. 

00:40:35
CHRISTY Okay. 

00:40:35
ZERKA MORENO Okay. Come on. Take your glasses off. I'll hold them. Oh, be careful there. You're the photographer. You are. 

00:40:50
CHRISTY Very nice. 

00:40:50
ZERKA MORENO Look at this picture. Is that a better picture? 

00:40:55
CHRISTY Yes. 

00:41:00
ZERKA MORENO I tell, you fine. Thank you very much everybody. I tell you what, Christy. Thank you for doing this, it's lovely. 

00:41:05
CHRISTY Oh, okay. 

00:41:05
ZERKA MORENO Thank and thank the helpers too. Every time you look at that picture, maybe you can lay, overlay it now [00:41;15] with the other one. All right? 

00:41:10
CHRISTY Okay. 

00:41:10
ZERKA MORENO Good. Thank you. 

00:41:10
CHRISTY Thank you very much. 

00:41:10
ZERKA MORENO It's fun. 

00:41:20
CHRISTY I appreciate it. 

00:41:20
ZERKA MORENO Thanks so much. 

00:41:20
CHRISTY This was fun. 

00:41:20
ZERKA MORENO Okay. Yeah. What were you, oh, Christy, don't go yet? Could you, could you stand here for a minute? What we usually do [00:41;40] after psychodrama is to have sharing from the group. I know this was not a profound psychodrama although it gave a, it had a nice light touch but it meant something to you, didn't it? Let the magic if, as if, realized and enacted. Well, what we do in psychodrama, we sit on the stage with the auxiliary egos. Let's have, bring the auxiliary egos back. I'm sorry. Let's bring them back. They don't have to come up on stage. Let's bring those three people back and, um, what I would like to see, where's the photographer? Okay. What I would like to have you do, what we do when we take a patient out of the group and they become, when a patient becomes a protagonist, they'll in a sense removed from the group, right? Highlighted. To reintegrate them into the group, we have what we call sharing. Sharing is not interpreting, guiding, analyzing. It's sharing from the heart, non-academic and so I'd like to hear from you. I'd like to have sharing on two levels. It's just a teaching session, you understand? From the level of the role you played and in what way it resembled or did not resemble something in your own life. So two levels. The role and your personal life. Why don't you come over here. You need a mic. Right. Use this one. Okay, very good. Can you hand her, go down there and hold it for them? Thank you. Yeah. Ouch. Fell down. I don't suppose that matters. Does it matter this one fell down? Okay. You actually had two roles, the photographer and Christy. Which of, what would you like to say about either of these roles? 

00:43:30
UNKNOWN Um. 

00:43:30
ZERKA MORENO Tell it to Christy. Tell Christy, so she can hear it. 

00:43:35
UNKNOWN Actually, playing both of the roles, um, it made me feel, uh, a little bit objective than the, the other two roles but it also made me feel like an outsider, like I couldn't get into either one of the roles. 

00:43:50
ZERKA MORENO Right. 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN Fully. 

00:43:50
ZERKA MORENO You couldn't get into the frau wife role either? 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN No, uh-huh. Because I couldn't, I, I mean... 

00:43:55
ZERKA MORENO You didn't have enough of a warm up as we call it. 

00:44:00
UNKNOWN Well, and I didn't, um, like the other two roles, they at least got to repeat what she, what her idea of what they said about, about the situation was but I didn't get to, I didn't get a really, you know, express her, her thoughts. 

00:44:15
ZERKA MORENO Well you got the idea when she re-did it. 

00:44:15
UNKNOWN Yes. Yes. 

00:44:20
ZERKA MORENO The whole purpose is not to get an interpretation but to, to show you what you would have liked to have had. 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Right. Right. 

00:44:25
ZERKA MORENO Yeah. Okay. Fine. Anything in your own life like it? That you, that resembles any of these scenes? For instance, interaction in the family? 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN Actually, while I was down off the stage, watching them, uh, when she was doing the husband role, um. 

00:44:35
ZERKA MORENO Talk to Christy directly. 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN It made me feel really good, uh, to hear the husband say what you wanted him to hear, that I'm proud of you, that you, you are an intelligent woman and, and, and to have, you know, have that pride for everything that you've done and everything [00:44;55] you've worked so hard for because it seems like that's also a struggle in my life, even though my husband does tell me... 

00:45:00
ZERKA MORENO Uh-huh. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN That, you know, I am proud of you, but sometimes it doesn't seem as sincere as you hope it would be. So I really felt like that was speaking to me. 

00:45:10
ZERKA MORENO Very good. We can all do with it more, can't we? 

00:45:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:45:10
ZERKA MORENO Yeah. 

00:45:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:45:15
ZERKA MORENO Thanks so much, dear. Now, would you like to start? You've been very helpful. Thanks. 

00:45:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, I felt... 

00:45:25
ZERKA MORENO You may sit, sure. 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN At, uh, the beginning, standing behind the chairs, I felt sort of like an outsider. I wasn't facing them face to face. I was standing behind them so I felt a little bit, uh, on the outside like that. It was a really, it was a wonderful feeling to know that the wife wanted me to be closer, something more intimate. You know, the face right with them, face to face and stuff like that and you said it felt a little silly to ask for that but it really felt good to be asked for that and it felt really good to be able to join the rest of the family in a much, uh, more intimate way like that. 

00:45:55
ZERKA MORENO Yeah, the bodily position and how you relate to other people in space is very important. 

00:46:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. In space. 

00:46:00
ZERKA MORENO Sure it is. Uh, personally? Is there anything from your personal life that resembles anything like this? 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, well, yeah. I mean, I can relate to, to both positions, to feeling on the outside a little bit and then feeling invited in, having somebody express that they want that, they want more closeness like that, a feeling of closeness there. 

00:46:20
ZERKA MORENO Remember that. 

00:46:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:46:20
ZERKA MORENO Good. Thanks so much. 

00:46:25
CHRISTY Can I, can I comment? 

00:46:30
ZERKA MORENO Yes. Of course you can. 

00:46:30
CHRISTY That, what you're saying makes a lot of sense to me 'cuz that is an issue, you know? I'm, I'm with my son pretty much most of the day and so sometimes my husband does feel left out, like my son will say to me mommy, give me a shower, help me with, do this, I want you to put me to bed. I want, he always wants me to do stuff and I think it makes my husband feel left out a little bit and so I think that that is, that would be a helpful thing for our family to get my husband more involved. 

00:46:55
ZERKA MORENO Uh-huh. It's a lesson for you too. 

00:46:55
CHRISTY Yes it is. 

00:46:55
ZERKA MORENO Very good. This is all learning, isn't it? Learning in action. Thanks so much. You may sit. Thanks so much. Thank you. You may go sit. You've been very helpful. Appreciate it. 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN Mommy. 

00:47:10
ZERKA MORENO We have to be very careful with this. People sometimes fall in love with each other in psychodrama. We start some beautiful romances. 

00:47:20
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) It's the, it's the Oedipus conflict. No, I would say, and it's strange that my son was here for the first few days. In fact, I didn't, uh, really go to any of the meetings, um, because I spent time with him. So it's strange to, uh, to play the role of a son but when that role reminds me of one time he told me, he looked me straight in the eye when I was giving him the parental, uh, stuff and he looked at me and he said you know, I'm just a kid and he, he was probably about 5, maybe 6 and, and he said it like he was telling me something that had never dawned upon me. 

00:48:00
ZERKA MORENO Right. 

00:48:00
UNKNOWN So, that, that struck me when, uh, the relaxing part. So... 

00:48:05
ZERKA MORENO What about your relationship to your own mother? 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN Well, as I was watching that and being part of it, I thought of myself kind of in each role and feeling like I've been in each role, both as the parent who is somewhat uptight about everyone's role but also being, feeling the person who was, um, uh, both, um, uh, wanting to be appreciated, that taking care of those little details which make a lot of a family run, the minor details and also as a person perhaps it's me, males, or whatever. Maybe it's the dad role and former husband role of saying, um, you need to be more, um, aware of these little things and a little more common sense and that, that sense that it lies on you to, to, uh, take care or protect or to, uh, make sure everything runs smoothly. So a lot of, a lot of different aspects. 

00:49:10
ZERKA MORENO Very good. Thanks so much. 

00:49:10
CHRISTY I just want to share a story about Gerrard now that you might like. Just recently, about two weeks ago, he was lying in his bed and he was just all cuddly and laughing and rolling around and I said what's going on and he goes, he goes I'm just so happy I have a bed, I have a home and people love me. 

00:49:25
ZERKA MORENO Aww, lovely. 

00:49:25
CHRISTY That, that meant so much to me. But that's as a 7 year old. 

00:49:30
ZERKA MORENO Right. 

00:49:30
CHRISTY As a four year old, he couldn't verbalize that kind of thing, so. 

00:49:35
ZERKA MORENO Terrific. 

00:49:35
CHRISTY But that's, you know. 

00:49:35
ZERKA MORENO Thank you so much. 

00:49:35
CHRISTY Thank you. 

00:49:35
ZERKA MORENO Thank you Christy. That was, that was delightful. 

00:49:45
[sil.] 

00:49:45
ZERKA MORENO I, can you see how, um, teaching people to role reverse, this would be a simple way to do it? A photograph and then changing the photograph how it would be preferred by the central figure. Um, and as I told you about this one that I did with 21 people, when he role reversed with his grandmother, speaking to himself as a little boy, 9 years old as he was in the picture, he began to cry, and he said, you know, I've never told you and I'm dead now but I loved you so much. You were my favorite grandchild and he shocked and in role reversal and back in his own role, he came to me, he said, I didn't know she loved me like that. Now, people say well aren't you idealizing things and aren't you making things more beautiful than they really are? I have to tell you that some psychodramas are really very, very real but I think the photograph is a nice way to start and to lead you into it because it's not as threatening as some, um, actual psychodramas can be. They can be quite difficult. But I'd like to tell you a little bit about how I role reversed with my son if that's all right with you, make myself an example. Um, I did a lot of role reverse and doubling with him and finally role reversing. Um, one evening I, um, you know how your roles sometimes conflict? You want to be in the role of the therapist and instead you're in the role of the housekeeper? Need I say more? And it was hot and steamy and I had cooked dinner because the housekeeper was off and we sit down to dinner. My son is just about three years old and here's how we sit. Daddy over there, mommy at the other end, Jonathon in between. And if I do that, you won't be able to see. Anyway, we sit down. I have to tell you that if you see pictures of my son at that time, you know he's not starving. But if you've been cooking and your food isn't appreciated, you also know how you feel. So we have steak and we have creamed spinach and we have salad and I'm sitting here eating and I suddenly notice, he's not eating and I forget all my lessons in child development. Every one of them and I stop being a loving mother because I still have that damned hangover from being the cook. Role conflict. Just don't like cooking. I'm very fortunate I don't often have to do it but when I have to do it, I don't like it any better. You're not eating. I'm not hungry. What do you mean you're not hungry? I cooked the steak just the way you liked it, brown on the outside and pink on the inside and you love creamed spinach and there are no lumps in the creamed spinach. I can't eat. Did you go to the hospital again and get ice cream this afternoon from the cook? Every time he walks by the kitchen, the cook calls him and he just gives him ice cream. You know you're not supposed to have ice cream just before dinner. He's three years old. 

00:53:55
[sil.] 

00:53:55
ZERKA MORENO Stop. This is ridiculous. Zerka, get up and be Jonathon. Jonathon, get up and be mommy. 

00:54:15
[sil.] 

00:54:15
ZERKA MORENO Now I am Jonathon. I have to remember my feet don't reach the floor and remember existentially, I'm Zerka and I have eaten so I am full. And I'm shocked 'cuz I told you, this, this is what he does. He stretches a foot and looks down his nose at me. I'm sitting here, my God, is this how he sees me? How awful. I begin to squinch even further down in my seat to be smaller and I suddenly have a terrible stomach ache and in Jonathon's role I'm saying to myself, I want to love my mother but right now I hate her. How can she do this to me? I, I can't eat and she's forcing me to eat and I, he says eat so I pick up my fork and I prod a piece of steak like I'm prodding her. And my mouth has gone dry and I don't like my mommy very much right now. I wish I had another mommy, one who'd understand m e. Now something very interesting. Children understand this method exactly. Jonathon, as mommy, picks up my fork and prods it in front of my, my face and this is significant because from the time he was 13 months old, he's been feeding himself. He just gently wiped my hand away, picked up his spoon and never had to be fed again. Very neatly. So he's showing me in action, isn't he, what I am doing to him, without words. So, I take the piece of steak. Have you ever eaten semi-cold steak? Doesn't taste, doesn't taste like anything. That's all right. Okay, I think I'm gonna plead with mommy. I can't eat. 

00:56:30
[sil.] 

00:56:30
ZERKA MORENO Then don't eat. Role reverse says this one and we role reverse. Okay. I have to admit that this took place over 40 years ago. This scene has never repeated itself. Not because of him, because of what I learned. Do know how many mother/child problems start right there at the dining room table in a battle of wills? Mother having to be appreciated for her cooking, for what she's done for you? And if I hadn't role reversed with Jonathon and did what I did, I might not have had this lesson in the same way I had. We learn better in action. That's my position, at least. Children learn better in action. I have to tell you that it made my son, this role reversal we did, what he did when he became me is he borrowed my authority and my strength and it affirmed who he is and he began to understand me better and in fact, um, I remember one day he asked me, he was about four years old, what's the difference between a giraffe and a zebra mommy? And I went to get one of his books, you know, his animal books and I tried to find it. You know when you try to find a picture like that, you can't find it? I said, you know, I said you know what darling? Next time we go to the zoo, I'll show you difference. Mommy, when I go to the zoo, I don't want to see the difference. I want to see the animals. I think what role reversal does when they borrow the stature of the powerful adult, it helps them to grow. We don't realize that they, they feel themselves as Liliputians in the world of giants and just getting down on your knees as that other young, that young man did so intuitively just the right thing to do once in a while. Get down on your hand and knees. Do you know when I crawled on the floor with my son, I learned what the difference was between one floor and another floor? Um, the rug and we crawled under the table and we made it a tent and you know how interesting it is to unscrew the legs so they wobble, you know? Life became more interesting for me and to this day, he says to me, you were my best playmate. That's a nice compliment. Thank you all very much for coming. We really don't have more time but thanks and remember to play.
