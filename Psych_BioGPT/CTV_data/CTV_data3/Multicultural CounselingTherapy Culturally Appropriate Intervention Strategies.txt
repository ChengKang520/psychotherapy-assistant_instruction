00:00:00
DERALD WING SUE  Welcome again everyone to our continuing lecture series on counseling the culturally diverse, theory and practice. Today, what we're going to try to do is put together, ah, all of the facts that we've been talking about in terms of how we will work with culturally, ah, culturally di-, ah, different client who comes in for help and one of the, ah, topics that we're dealing with specifically today is the development of culturally appropriate intervention strategies in working, particularly, with racial, ethnic minority populations. Ah, one of the things that we've learned is that increasingly, mental health practitioners are being asked to develop culturally appropriate intervention strategies to meet the lifestyles, the cultural values of the various racial groups that they're working with. Studies consistently indicate at this point that minority group individuals tend to prefer a more directive-

Clients of Color Preference in Therapy 

00:01:30
DERALD WING SUE - rather than nondirective approach to counseling and therapy; Ah, an active rather than a passive one; A structured explicit approach rather than an ambiguous one, and a counselor who tends to self-disclose their thoughts and feelings when working with, ah, a client. Now, these are not rigid standards that are used or, or universal in application but they do contrast sharply with the traditional methods of counseling and psychotherapy. To indicate, ah, the importance of this, I'm going to be reading to you, and you can read on the screen as well, a case study of Betty Lau, a client who, a recent immigrant, who comes in for therapeutic help. And as we listen and I read this case to you, I want you to try to do two things. First of all, what do you believe to be the main issues confronting this client, ah, Betty Lau, a recent Chinese immigrant to the United States. And secondarily, in the description itself, what thoughts do you have about the, ah, standards that are using, being used by the counselor as he describes Betty that may give us some idea into his diagnosis and potential treatment. This is something that he wrote, ah, during his externship. 

00:03:05
The Case of Betty Lau 

00:03:05
DERALD WING SUE My first experience in working with a Chinese immigrant occurred while serving an externship in New York Chinatown. My client was Betty Lau, a 30 year old, living with her parents who presented with depression, somatic symptoms, and conflicts related to parental wishes versus her own desires. Betty felt guilty and at fault for her family's tension; they disapproved of her new male friend who occupied her time on the weekends. Her father was unemployed, depressed most of the time, and seemed removed from the family; her mother felt overburdened and ineffective and did little of the household chores and duties. Being the oldest in the family, Betty felt obligated to help economically and was increasingly assuming most of the domestic responsibilities for keeping the home running. She harbored strong unexpressed resentments towards her parents and seemed to feel trapped. Betty believed that if she was a better daughter, more grateful, and worked harder, the family problems would diminish greatly. She often wondered aloud why she could not be more grateful towards her parents as they sacrificed much to bring their fam-, a family to a new country. Over the past year, her unhappiness grew so intense that she could not sleep nor eat well. She began to lose weight rapidly and sought help at the clinic. Betty was a very difficult client to work with. She refused to involve her parents in family counseling and made me promise not to tell them about her use of our services. She was relatively quiet in the sessions, spoke in a barely audible voice, seemed unresponsive to questions, and volunteered little in the way of information. She seldom made eye contact, a sign of her shyness or depression. Her responses were polite, but very brief and she avoided "feeling" statements. Instead, she talked about her fatigue, loss of appetite, headaches, inability to sleep and other physical ailments. Talking with Betty was like "pulling teeth" as our sessions were punctuated by long silences. It was clear to me that Betty was too submissive and that part of her depression was putting family interests above her own. I saw two therapeutic goals for her: (a) to encourage Betty to think of her own needs first, leave her family, live alone, and not let her parents override her wishes, or (b) if Betty chose to stay at home, she needed to be more forceful in setting limits for her parents. Betty was obviously dependent and enmeshed in pa-, the pathology of the family. She had to rid herself her, of her guilt feelings, learn to stand up for her own rights and not be a doormat to the world. At 30 years of age she needed to make a life of her own, get married, and start a family. My clinical goals at that time were to have Betty be more independent, assert herself appropriately, by way of assertiveness training and express her feelings openly and honestly toward her parents. In the sessions, however, Betty had considerable difficulty with role playing and talking about her feelings. While she indirectly acknowledged harboring resent, ah, feelings of resentment, she could never directly bring herself to verbally express them. Roleplays and behavioral rehearsal techniques failed miserably. When I tried the "Gestalt Empty Chair" technique and encouraged her to speak to her parents in the empty chair, she seemed to "freeze up" and would not cooperate. After her third session with me, Betty failed to return for her, any future sessions. Now, the case of Betty Lau is a very interesting one because it brings together so many different facets of multicultural counseling that an enlightened counselor or therapist needs to be aware of. This case specifically illustrates how Western-European approaches to counseling may lead to mistaken assessment, diagnosis and treatment of culturally diverse clients. The therapist seems not to have an understanding of how culture influences help-seeking behavior, how culture affects the manner of symptom formation, that is that when you encounter psychological distress, different groups tend to express those distress in different ways. And thirdly, what constitutes relevant cultural helping among different, diverse groups? Let us take each of these points, uhm, and look at them quite carefully as we apply culturally appropriate intervention strategies in the, ah, assessment diagnosis and treatment of Betty, raise these issues. Some of you, ah, who are viewing this tape may wish to turn it off so that you can at least, ah, dialogue on the case of Betty before listening to our analysis and to the rest of the, ah, lecture ah, ah, this afternoon. First, it is very clear and obvious that the therapist is using- 

00:09:25
Cultural Case Analysis: Betty Lau 

00:09:25
DERALD WING SUE - Western-European standards to, ah, judge normality and abnormality, and desirable and undesirable goals. Part of the problem seems to reside in the implicit assumption that individuality is healthier than ah, family identity or group, ah, ah, identification. The counselor here seems to be emphasizing that it is healthier for one to be their "own person" as opposed to being as he puts it, "enmeshed in the pathology and overly dependent of, on the family." After all, I think the counselor might even argue that Betty is 30 years old and still living with her parents. There must be something wrong, ah, ah, related to this. The other thing is that in an individualistic culture and society and situation in which counseling and psychotherapy tends to reflect that, the individual-centered approach tends to locate the problem as residing in Betty, the person, as opposed to maybe greater, ah, issues that, ah, affect on a systemic level, ah, ah, Betty its, ah, herself. A collectivistic orientation, however, if you had one, would lead you to a different analysis and conclusion. Ah, Zhang(ph), a, ah, former doctoral student who worked with Professor Allen Ivey wrote an analysis of his response to a very similar case and I would like to read it to you to indicate this different world view in individualism and collectivism. And this comes from Zhang(ph), ah, directly. "I just cannot understand why putting the family's interest before one's own is not correct or normal in the dominant American culture. I believe a morally responsible son or daughter has the duty to take care of his or her parents whether it means sacrifice on his or her part or not. What is wrong with this interdependence?" Notice that he uses the phrase "interdependence" and not dependence. "To me, it would be extremely selfish for the client to leave her family when the family is in such need of her. In contemporary China, submergence of self for the good of the family, the community or country is still valued and individualism, condemned. Western mental health practice could fail should we adopt American counseling theories and skills without considerable alteration. Zhang(ph) goes on to say, "Although I do not believe the client has a significant psychological problem, I do believe that the parents have to become more sensitive to their daughter's needs. It is not very nice and considerate for the parents to think only of themselves at the cost of their daughter, at, at the cost of their daughter's well being. If I were the counselor of this client, I would do everything in my power to try to change the parents rather than the client. I feel strongly that it is a selfish person who needs to change, not the selfless one." Now, this really not only indicates a major difference in world view, ah, that is, ah, moderated by, ah, an individualistic versus, ah, collectivistic orientation, but when you take a collectivistic orientation, the focus of change doesn't simply reside with the client, Betty, but with the family system or perhaps even larger in terms of, of the community. And that is one of the things that I want all of you to be aware of that world views oftentimes will dictate how you see a situation and define a problem. 

00:13:45
DERALD WING SUE Second culture has been found to influence help-seeking behaviors and how psychological distress, uhm, is expressed. In counseling, it is entirely possible that Betty's reluctance to talk about her feelings, uhm, toward her parents and the focus on somatic symptoms is really a manifestation of cultural dynamics that are occurring within her. For example, restraint of strong feelings as a cultural, is a cultural dictate among many Asian, ah, cultures and, ah, an unenlightened therapist may begin to evaluate this person as being repressed and, ah, inhibited in one way or another. And so, one of the things that we need to recognize is the importance of culture in, ah, in, ah, you know, ah, affecting the various means of expressing disorders. Now, the other major conflict that can occur is that a counselor or therapist who wants Betty to express strongly her feelings of anger, resentment towards her parents may make sense at some level but it may be in conflict with a strong cultural dictate of filial, ah, piety, respect for, ah, ah, one's parents. And so the counselor might unknowingly be putting Betty in a severe culture conflict or clash that would make the problem worse rather than, ah, allow, ah, ah, Betty to deal with that adequately. Furthermore, one of the things that the counselor might not be aware of is that Betty may be very concerned about not having the parents come in for counseling or any of her family or friends, ah, realize this because in traditional Asian culture, one does not talk about deep, intimate issues with a stranger that may be, for the counselor might be perceived of. In fact, the collectivistic orientation means that it may ah, bring dishonor and shame to the entire family. So, issues of confidentiality here are all important for many culturally different groups, especially, ah, for Asians and, ah, Asian Americans. Studies also reveal that may explain why Asian Americans underutilize traditional mental health services and prematurely terminate after they come in and that is because, uhm, it is considered inappropriate to talk about psychiatric problems with someone, uhm, who is an outsider. In fact, one of the findings that we have, ah, ah, found is that when Asian Americans or Asians do go in for traditional western mental health services, they are likely to exhibit more severe disorders than their white counterparts. Now, ask yourself why this must be so. Well, the reason that we, uhm, ah, entertain that, uhm, that may explain this situation is that only the most severely disturbed individuals who find the family networks, of the community networks are unable to help them will find them, ah, themselves going for counseling and psychotherapy because it represents a desperate last resort on their part to go in. So that, ah, yes, maybe, uhm, ah, ah, persons of color may oftentimes appear more pathological because you're getting, ah, a, a more pathological sample, ah, in, in, ah, seeking help at this point. For Betty and many Asian clients, the other major issue that therapists should be aware of is that there is higher degrees of somaticizing in traditional Asians. We find, ah, for example in our studies that when Asian Americans experience, uhm, a psychological distress, they are more likely to express it through sleeplessness, inability to sleep, headaches, uhm, and loss of appetite. Talking about physical ailments is more acceptable for Asian clients than talking about mental health issues. And so, that might be one of the factors why, uhm, Asian Americans tend to somaticize more, and this has been replicated in study after study. Of course, if you have a psychodynamic, uhm, ah, orientation, you might say that somatization is increased because of, of, uhm, ah, restraint of strong feelings and that may, ah, occur at some level as well. But the likely, the explanation lies in the cultural reason as to how symptoms are appropriately, ah, ah, described. 

00:18:45
DERALD WING SUE  The third area that is essential to the, today's presentation is that the actual process of counseling and psychotherapy may be antagonistic to the values held by culturally diverse clients who seek help from us in one form or another. Betty's perceived resistance to counseling, her short but polite responses, unresponsiveness to questions, avoidance of, ah, feeling statements and lack of eye contact, uhm, and the therapist's use of potentially inappropriate counseling, uhm, ah, techniques such as getting Betty to express her feelings towards even roleplayed, uhm, ah, parents, ah, to assert herself through, ah, behavioral rehearsal may be antagonistic to the cultural values of the client that, that, uhm, are, are evident here. So, one of the things that I want you to really be concerned about is the issue of communication styles and helping styles, in other words, an intimate link between communication styles and helping styles, uhm, that are culturally based on, ah, if you are not aware of these factors, you may be, in some sense, using inappropriate helping. The therapist in this case seems not to be aware of differences in communication style. Ah, we will talk about this very shortly, the barely audible, ah, ah, tone of voice of, of Betty, ah, the avoidance of eye contact, avoidance of feeling statements may all be types of, ah, communication styles that have no pathology associated with it, but to an unenlightened counselor or therapist, they may misinterpret the meaning of avoidance of eye contact, lower sound of the voice, pauses that go on and, and so forth or, or silences. Uhm, further, it's really important for us to realize as I've said in previous tapings that subtlety is a form of communication style in many cultures. The directness of identifying problems and solving them is very Western, ah, European in origin, and therefore getting to the heart of the problem may, in some sense, be not appropriate initially to begin with in working with clients who are culturally, ah, ah, different. So, what I would like to do today is to talk about issues of communication styles and give some recommendations of, uhm, of, uhm, ah, what we can do to adapt ah, in a more flexible manner how we work with culturally diverse, uhm, ah, clients that requires us to really understand communication both verbal and nonverbal communication styles. I concentrate more on nonverbal communication because it seems to be a more powerful factor in misunderstandings that occur. Now, what do I, how do I define communication styles? Communication styles refers to factors that go beyond the content of what is said. Studies suggest that from 30, only 30 to 40 percent of the content of what is communicated is done so conversationally, which means that 60 to 70 percent of the meaning of the message is communicated nonverbally or contextually in one way or another. Communication styles represent these social rhythms that underlie our actions and speech. They refer to things like the smoothness of our conversations, the topics we choose to discuss or avoid, uhm, ah, whether we talk in superficial or in depth, ah, much more intimate ah, meaning, ah, the form of interaction, ah, which can be ritualistic, ah, repartee, argumentative or even persuasive. That's what we're talking about when we talk about, ah, communication styles. Communication styles are radically affected by gender, race, culture and ethnicity. How people communicate is oftentimes moderated by these factors. We know, for example, in studies that men are very direct, task-oriented when they communicate while women tend to be much more relationally-oriented and tend to be much more attune to feelings in the interpersonal realm, and this is moderated by gender whether a man or a woman. Culture also does that. Race also are powerful determinants of that. There are four major, uhm, areas that we can talk about in terms of nonverbal communication that oftentimes leads to confusion. 

00:24:10
Nonverbal Communication Dimensions 

00:24:10
DERALD WING SUE These four areas are proxemics, kinesics, paralanguage and high or low context cultures in terms of, ah, communication. Let's talk about the first one, ah, very quickly and briefly. 

00:24:25
DERALD WING SUE Proxemics refers to the perception and use of personal space and distance. Edward Hall, a well-known, uhm, ah, anthropologist, uhm, who wrote a classic book called "The Silent Language," has found in his work that you, in, in America, in the United States, people have different conversing distances and they dictate, the conversing distances dictate the degree of intimacy you have with the listener or the speaker. From about physical contact to in, uhm, ah, to 18 inches away when you're, ah, if you allow people to come within, uhm, 18 inches to touch you, it generally indicates that you have a much more personal and intimate relationship with the listener or speaker. The farther you are away, the more, uhm, it, uhm, the more formal you have in terms of the relationship with the listener or speaker. Uhm, what Edward Hall found was that about 12 feet on was the zone of formal lecturing in which, uhm, ah, if any, for example, if people during lecture were to come close to me, ah, it would violate the social distance that I would consider to be appropriate or inappropriate. Years ago, there was this program that I like to, ah, oftentimes talk about, uhm, called, uhm, "Candid Camera." Ah, this was a, a TV program and a series of movies in which they would set up very unusual situations unbeknownst, uhm, ah, to subjects that they would, they were ridiculous situations. Uhm, you know, for example, they would have, uhm, an en-, take the engine out of a car, ah, on an incline have, ah, a person, the driver sit in it and pretend, ah, the car would drift down the hill into a service station and the driver would pretend that, uhm, ah, that he drove the car, he or she drove the car to the service station. They'd stopped and asked the person to, "Could you check the oil under the hood?" The service station attendant would, ah, open the hood and, ah, be amazed and say, "But you don't have an engine here". Ah, and of course, the driver would, ah, feign innocence and on(ph), there were situations created to get laughs out of, uhm, ah, the audience who'd be, be viewing that. I recall one that used, ah, ah, personal space as an experiment. This one involved, uhm, a, uhm, a, a person who pretended he was an interviewer, ah, and interviewing, ah, housewives who were coming out of, of a supermarket as to whether which soap detergent they preferred more, ah, Tide versus, ah, ah, you know, a Procter and Gamble, ah, product and they had a microphone, and I remember that they would catch these, ah, women coming out either with their shopping carts or sacks of groceries and say, "Could we have a few minutes of your time?" and they would put the microphone into the face of the individual and asked them, tell them that they were doing this survey. Ah, they were going to give them, ah, a, you know, a free package of, it would only, ah, of, of soap. All they had to do is answer a few questions and almost all the, the women, uhm, ah, ah, agreed to this. But what was unbeknownst to them was that in one situation, the interviewer would stand an appropriate distance away from the, ah, woman being interviewed and slowly move forward and lean forward, and the reactions were really quite astounding. I mean there was, uhm, ah, one woman who when this began to happen would pull her grocery of, ah, sacks in front of her. One woman who didn't have grocery, ah, ah, a grocery with her or isn't carrying anything actually had her hand, palms up against the chest of the man as he was trying to lean, uhm, ah, forward. In another situation that occurred, the woman had backed up in the parking lot against the hood of the car and the man kept coming forward and she was leaning clear back, ah, during this entire, uhm, ah, interview. But what was clearly occurring was that the individual was violating personal space. Now, personal space is culturally determined, ah, also not only with respect to intimacy, but, ah, there are cultural differences, uhm, that often occur. Latin Americans, Africans, uhm, Black Americans, Indonesians, Arabs, ah, South Americans and the French have a much closer conversing distance. If you've ever traveled, ah, abroad to France and talked to French citizens, they really moved quite close to you and it's almost like a powerful force where you back out, and sometimes you're unaware of what might be, ah, occurring. Ah, Allen Ivey's early work, uhm, suggested, for example, that Eskimos, ah, Alaskan Natives, oftentimes, uhm, not only have different conversing distances but body orientation was very important. That is that talking about intimate aspects of one's life. You didn't seat across from one another. You sat side by side. Uhm, ah, ah, Amado Padilla, well-known, ah, Latino psychologist, and some of his early work found that even furniture arrangement in a, uhm, office or an institution had much to do with the powerful effects it had on, ah, ah, clients or customers who, who would come into the situation. Now, it isn't very difficult for us to realize how personal space may affect how we react towards our client. If you're working with a client who much, has much closer conversing distance and they pull their seats up or lean forward, the, ah, reactions that may occur with you is that you might tip your chair back, cross your arms, misunderstanding begins to occur. The counselor, unbeknownst, uhm, not being aware of it might evaluate this client as being pushy, aggressive or socially inappropriate. Now, the client, however, who is user to a, ah, used to a closer conversing distance, ah, may not be aware of that but our feeling that this person is impersonal, uhm, ah, lacks of warmth, uhm, ah, tends to be aloof and cold, and be, you know. What happens is that after that interaction, the client may simply not return because they're thinking is that this counselor or helping professional could be less interested in who I am and what needs to be done, ah, in the situation. So, one of the things that really, uhm, is important for us to be aware of is our nonverbal behavior and the impact that it may have on culturally, ah, diverse clients that we work with. 

00:31:45
DERALD WING SUE The other major nonverbal, uhm, ah, grouping which lots of research has been done is what we call Kinesics, which are bodily movements such as facial expression, posture, gestures and eye contact. We know for a fact that there are cultural groups, racial groups, for example, African-Americans, when they talk they tend to use much more animated bodily, ah, behaviors and language. If you've ever watched debates on TV where politicians are debating, you can oftentimes notice that, uhm, white politicians tend to sit, ah, legs crossed, hands folded, ah, a minimal of, of movements of the hands and so forth. If you've ever watched an African-American politician communicate, there's a lot of head movements, ah, body movements, gestures of the arms and, and so forth that occur. Culture and race are powerful determinants of how we, uhm, ah, communicate. You know, we hear this, uhm, ah, we know Italians, for example, use a lot of, ah, ah, physical gestures to communicate things. So, that we have this major differences touching people, ah, also varies considerably in terms of, of the culture. Now, facial expression is one of the most powerful diagnostic tools that we use, not just in counseling and psychotherapy, but in our evaluation of, ah, of, ah, individuals. Usually, facial expression reread the responsiveness or, ah, the involvement that a speaker or a listener has with us. Among the most powerful ah, facial, uhm, ah, expressions that we evaluate on is smiling. Smiling to us indicates a positive affect. When I say "us," I mean generally U.S. society and U.S. culture. Usually a person who smiles we perceive as being warm, friendly, uhm, oftentimes, they're pleasant. We say that they have a good personality. The Japanese, however, smile, the Japanese smile or laugh however does not necessarily indicate happiness nor conveys comfort. In fact, what we have is that oftentimes, a Japanese, ah, smile conveys, uhm, embarrassment, discomfort, or shyness in one way or another. Uhm, there is a lot of cultural factors that indicate, ah, that Asians value restraint of strong feelings. In fact, I've mentioned this several times. My, my father, uhm, believes that the, ah, a mature Chinese individual is one who shows minimal facial changes or features. This is one of the reasons I believe why, uhm, why many, ah, Asians are oftentimes described as being inscrutable, sneaky, you can't read their, uhm, ah, facial expression. Rather than being inscrutable, sneaky, uhm, ah, back stabbers or so forth, it is really a cultural factor that may be, ah, affecting that, the ex-, facial expressions that are going on. Another, uhm, ah, facial expression or feature that is powerful is eye contact. In many forms of counseling and psychotherapy, we use eye contact as a diagnostic indicator, and it can be very important to understand that. Usually, however, when I hear a colleague say something like, "Notice that the father or the client avoided eye contact with the son or daughter or behind such a statement is implicit that is a diagnostic sign of something negative. The, ah, ah, avoiding eye contact may indicate in our culture in the United States in the Western way, something that is very, uhm, ah, negative. However, avoidance of eye contact among Navajos, well, it's a reverse of that. Among many Navajos, directness of a stare, making eye contact with you is, is directly the opposite. It's a sign of hostility and anger. Ah, among many, uhm, Mexicans and among Asians, avoidance of eye contact is a sign of deference and respect for someone who is older, wiser or occupies higher prestige and, and status. The issue of eye contact al-, also varies that creates misunderstandings in black-white relationships. Group studies tend to, uhm, ah, indicate that when whites listen to a speaker, they tend to make eye contact about 80 percent of the time. Ah, in other words, if I'm in a classroom lecturing, ah, students, white students generally will look at me, make eye contact with me about 80 percent of the time. However, the reverse of that is true when they speak to a listener, if I'm, uhm, ah, if, if, if I'm a white American, I'm speaking to someone who is a listener, I make eye contact less that 50 percent of the time. That is that when I'm speaking to you, I don't maintain eye contact. I would look at your shoulder, glance off, make the eye contact and glance away again. And, ah, in terms of the statistics, there's, it, it's about 50 percent of the time. Blacks, in marked contrast as a group, when speaking, make greater eye contact that their white counterparts. If I'm an African-American speaking to you as a listener, I am most likely to make greater than 50 percent eye contact with you. However, there is a completely different, uhm, ah, statistic. If I'm an African-American listening you the speaker, I make infrequent eye contact. Some of the early studies, uhm, by the Franklins, ah, on this suggest that the mere physical proximity of an African-American who is listening is in, is a cultural cue that they are listening. Now, this creates major misunderstandings at time. You know, teachers have oftentimes, uhm, ah, reprimanded, ah, Black students as they're giving a lesson plan that they don't make eye contact. They misperceive or misinterpret this as meaning that, uhm, ah, Black students are unmotivated, inattentive and so forth. Ah, these are all powerful things that race and culture affects in terms of the, uhm, ah, eye contact, ah, area. And I would have you, uhm, really begin to look at this quite, ah, carefully because the power of nonverbals are that they are unconscious and unintentional. I don't know why I feel uncomfortable for example with, ah, talking, ah, ah, to a Black colleague because of, ah, you know, the nonverbals that are antagonistic to, ah, the interpretation. I'm not aware of why I'm feeling uncomfortable or even fearful. In fact, in some studies, many white Americans talk about their, uhm, discomfort and anxiety when talking specifically with Black men. And, ah, a lot of times, there are several things going on. Ah, the closer conversing distance, the more animated behaviors, the eye contact, all trigger off stereotypes and images that white America have about the violence-prone Black male. So, not only is, is it important for us to realize the importance and power of nonverbals, but to be in touch with, ah, what gets triggered off in us that represents biases, stereotypes, racial fears and anxieties that may interfere with our ability to work with people, who are racially, culturally different. 

00:40:30
DERALD WING SUE The third area that is very important for us to understand in communication styles deal with Paralanguage. This refers to, ah, other vocal cues used to communicate. The loudness of your voice, such as seeing that Betty spoken a very soft way, Native Americans also speak in a very soft way. In the old days, uhm, in the early 1930s, you know, they did major research to find out, the question was, "Why could not the Japanese speak louder?" And they did ridiculous studies like had the Japanese, uhm, ah, subjects yell into, uhm, ah, ah, ah, audible, a, a measuring devices to get the decibel readings and, lo and(ph) behold what did they find. That when encouraged to, ah, yell or speak as loud as they could that the Japanese were capable of doing it. Ah, what I'm saying is, and if, the strange thing is that they didn't consider that there were cultural factors. It was easier for them to entertain the notion of biological or anatomical differences that created this as supposed to cultural factors that dictate the loudness of one's communication pauses and silences, uhm, hesitations, inflection, uhm, that you use in, in uhm, ah, paralanguage, all tend to have powerful effects on your evaluation of, of clients or individuals that come from a culturally, ah, different group. The English and Arabs, ah, for example, use silence as a sign of privacy. Silence is not always an invitation for you, the listener, to take up the conversation. If you look at the standards of, uhm, people in the United States, most of the, what we know is that, uhm, that most U.S. Americans can tolerate only three seconds of silence. Now, you try that out. Start counting, one, I mean if you're talking with someone, stop talking and start in your head counting one, two. Before you get to three, that individual will start talking, ah, because it, it, you know, in, in our things, it's a cultural cue for individuals to speaks. Russians, French and, and Spanish use silence as a sign of, ah, of agreement. Among many Native Americans, in fact, Native Americans are a population that many of my white colleagues seem to have considerable difficulty working. Now, if you remember the case of, of Betty Lau that we read to you, uhm, earlier, remember that counselor's description was that it was like pulling teeth to get Betty to talk. Now, this oftentimes is a, is a latency, uhm, problem between, uhm, ah, what, what one group considers silence and other groups consider silence. If your, ah, ah, definition of silence is three seconds and with Native Americans, I'm not sure that they've done any studies, but literally, you can sit there for minutes without exchanging a word with, ah, ah, some Native American clients and they don't get uncomfortable at all. So, what I'm saying here is that if you begin to pathologize silence or to feel out of sync in the conversation of, ah, with the client, this is really, uhm, ah, something that we need to begin to look, ah, look at carefully. This is different from, ah, what some, ah, ah, therapists or schools of thought, like the humanistic, ah, existential schools, ah, recommend using silence as a therapeutic tool. I guess you could see it that way. But, ah, culture dictates the pace and style of how one, ah, ah, speaks. Arabs, if we talk about loudness of, of, ah, of what(ph) the volume and intensity of speech, Arabs like to be bathed in sound. Ah, I mean, they can have radios going sound, going all over so, uhm, ah, the loudness and intensity is something that Arabs are very used, ah, used to. Another area of, ah, that we can talk about in terms of, of paralanguage is the directness of conversation or the degree of frankness. Remember I said before that if you've never traveled to Asia, communication is indirect and subtle. However, in the United States and certain European countries, directness is very valued. It is direct, confrontive, to the point. In fact, if you look at, ah, watched English parliament in operation, uhm, they tend to be very, you know, the speaker, Tony Blair, will get up and start speaking and he's heckled, ah, and confronted, uhm, ah, throughout and he's not disturbed by it because it is culturally sanctioned, ah, ah, among them in terms of the heckling, uhm, that, that occurs and the interplay that, ah, that happens here. Ah, Asians, as I've said, ah, indirectness and subtlety of communication is a highly prized art and getting to the point is, uhm, is not perhaps as important as how you get to the point and define the problem. American Indians oftentimes re-, ah, consider the direct confrontive strategies of, let's say, Gestalt counseling, the roleplays, assertiveness training that we talked about as something, ah, for, ah, Betty. Many Ameri-, ah, American Indians consider those forms of helping and communication to be, ah, immature, rude and crude forms of communication that is lacking in respect for the integrity of the individual. So, while you might be well intentioned in terms of how you work with a, a client and being direct to, to the point and to the heart of the matter, the client is experiencing you as a, ah, disrespectful helping professional, who, ah, can be very offensive in terms of the communication that is going on. 

00:47:10
DERALD WING SUE The fourth area of non-verbal communication is what we call High and low context, ah, communication. Communication for many groups is anchored in the situation, ah, or it is anchored in the words, uhm, ah, that are speaking. High context cultures rely heavily on nonverbal communications or group identification and understanding. Ah, I might have given this example, uhm, you know, if you remember, for example, gone to, let's say, the Philippines. You ask for directions ah, of how to get there. Well, this person may give you directions that are wrong and you may get upset about it, but it is very difficult for them to deny a request, to say "no", but they are communicating to you in different ways that they don't know the direction, but you aren't picking it up. You have to understand, ah, ah, the context of, of what is being, a "no" in certain Asian cultures can mean a, can mean a "yes", a "yes" in an Asian culture can be a "no". It is contextual in understanding it. The U.S., however, is a low context culture. Ah, in other words, it emphasizes the rule of law and procedure, and the spoken or written word. You pay attention to the words rather than the overall context and meaning of what might be going on. African-Americans in the United States are very high-context groups. They use nonverbals and experiential sharing to communicate. As I've indicated before the use, much less words to communicate the same content that a white American requires, uhm, ah, to, to understand the same content. Now, let's now talk, uhm, about, uhm, the importance of communication styles and nonverbal communication. There's a frequent saying that is, uhm, ah, given by many of my Black brothers and sisters and the common saying is this, that if you really want to understand where Dr. Smith or Mrs. Jones is coming from, don't listen to what they say but how they say it. Now, behind that statement is an implicit statement that nonverbals are more accurate reflections of what the person truly intends, and many racial ethnic groups have learned that to be true especially if it deals with potential stereotypes, biases and, and prejudices. Don't look, ah, don't listen to what the person, ah, says, but how they say it is very important. If I ask you, "How do you feel about interracial relationships?" and I say to you, "Oh, it's okay with me," I'm sending you a mixed communication, and among vary, ah, people of color, among women, ah, they have learned that the nonverbals are more accurate, ah, reflections. In fact, in many of the studies that are going on, people of color and women are better readers of nonverbal communication than their white counterparts. So, one of the primary issues that, ah, occurs here is not only must you understand and be attuned to nonverbal communications and how culture affects it, but potentially, the socio-political ramification and meaning to the expression of, uhm, ah, non-verbal, ah, uhm, communication. The power of nonverbals, as I've mentioned before, is in the fact that they are under least conscious control. In multicultural counseling and psychotherapy, the culturally-diverse clients you will work with are likely to put more credence in terms of your nonverbals, those four attributes that I have given, uhm, ah, as part of nonverbal communication than that specific content of what you are saying, and they are likely to be testing you and making an evaluation in judgment about whether you are able to work with them, ah, appropriately, uhm, ah, or not. Uhm, and the other area that I would say is that nonverbal, since I've given, ah, ah, you know, frequently, as an example, are triggers of our biases and fears that may, uhm, oftentimes occur as I've indicated, ah, to you before. The mere acquisition, ah, of knowledge and understanding to be effective in multicultural counseling is not enough unless you understand different styles of communication. 

00:52:35
DERALD WING SUE Let me talk about something very important, non-verbose as triggers to our biases and fears, and use the example of African-American, white styles of, of communication and how they interact. This will give you some example, uhm, ah, of where we get major misunderstandings and how it tends to make us, ah, ah, trigger some of the fears that we might have, ah, related to Black-white, ah, ah, interactions here. The studies indicate that African-Americans, Blacks tend to talk about expressing thoughts and feelings with passion. The Black mode of communication, ah, tends to be high-keyed, animated, interpersonal, and confrontational. Ah, the characteristics of African-American or Black styles of communication tend to be that, they tend to be heated, higher in volume and they generate considerable affect. Ah, the communicator generally perceives themselves as an advocate of a position, ah, and that is generally an indication of honesty and sincerity, to be genuine, to be advocating, to be speaking, uhm, from the heart, ah, sincerely about what's going on. Ideas are tested in the crucible of argumentation. It is a very acceptable way, uhm, in which interactions and testing and exchanging ideas tend to occur. However, if we contrast the African-American style of communication with the white mode of communication, something that I indicated, ah, ah, just now, the white mode of communication is best described as being dispassionate, impersonal and non-challenging. We, in the United States, white styles tend to say that, ah, to be devoid of feelings, to think about things rationally and objectively is highly valued. Ah, these characteristics can be described as being cool, quiet and without affect because there is a belief that, uhm, ah, emotion is antagonistic to reason, while black styles tend to be that the expression of affect isn't a sign of sincerity here. The person, white styles of communication tend to see themselves when speaking as spokespersons rather than advocates, and this to them is a valued indication of objectivity. And so, oftentimes, I see between, ah, Black and white students in my class an exchange of ideas in which white students are disinclined to, I mean, I mean not the white students, Black students are disinclined to believe that their white classmate doesn't hold an opinion or feeling or thought. In fact, many whites tend to say the most recent study by Sue indicates that a Black student may say something, "I don't care what Sue says. What do you think?" Well, it's not important to studies and you get a major misunderstanding in terms of the valued style of, of communication. The interpretation of these communication styles, ah, especially when whites are interpreting black styles of communication, ah, this is what they, ah, have been, descriptions that have been given about, ah, ah, black styles of communication by, ah, white Americans, that it represents a Baptist Revival meeting. It's a pep rally. There is a loss of self-control, that it is too emotional, that it is provocative, threatening or hostile, that it's irrational, and possibility of violence is likely ah, to occur. It leads to a hardening of views, "Why can't you keep the emotions out of that?" Ah, emotion and reason to many whites are antagonistic and work against one another. Now, Blacks however, perceived white styles of communication, uhm, in, uhm, their framework to be insincere, to be hiding something, to be inauthentic. There's a, ah, ah, Black language, ah, often caused this fronting, which is consciously concealing what you really think or feel. They believe, African-Americans believe that the presence of affect is unifying because it operates within rather than outside of the persuasive process, and so, you oftentimes get these really mixed styles of, uhm, interaction. What is harmful is that styles of communication by a white therapist who is unenlightened and who understands little about, ah, himself or herself, and their biases and fears, may inappropriately diagnose this person as potentially dangerous, threatening, and prone to, ah, ah, harming others. That is a very common, ah, ah, belief that our society tends to hold of, ah, ah, of many African-Americans. Well, in light of understanding communication style differences that are moderated by culture and social-political issues, what are the practice implications for all of us? One of the practice implications is that, uhm, many of the traditional Western European taboos that I've talked about that we don't give advice and suggestions, we don't self-disclose cannot be universally applied to racial ethnic groups that you work with, that the non-directive approach may be, ah, inappropriate and inaccurate as I indicated early on here. Now if you look at some of the work of, ah, Allen Ivey in Microtraining, there are two large classes or divisions that he makes about the skills that a counselor or a therapist uses in each session. One large grouping is attending skills. Ano-, another large grouping is influencing skills. Attending skills are those clinical behaviors, counseling behaviors, ah, that the counselor engages in that attends to the client. They involve things like, what he calls "minimal encouragers," like if you're seated with a client, "Uh-huh," "yes," the head nod, the eye contact, the appropriate body lean, these are all minimal encouragers that are given by the counselor to encourage the client to continue talking. Ah, attending, of ah, skills also deal with things like paraphrasing, reflecting the feelings. Influencing skills as a second class tend to be more active in which, ah, you may give advice and suggestions, take a teaching role, interpret and engage in a number of different behavior. Most traditional forms of counseling and psychotherapy talk about the counsel and therapist being less active in attending to the client. In fact that is one of the reasons why we are told not to give advice and suggestions and not to self-disclose because it unduly influences, ah, the client. However, study after study suggests that it is the counselor or helping professional who is able to engage freely in both attending and influencing skills has higher credibility with culturally diverse groups that seek help. So one of the things in terms of, uhm, education and training is that all of us need to expand the repertoire of helping responses that will able, ah, to engage them and use them appropriately when they are called for. A second, ah, implication for counseling and psychotherapy is that I often times am very disturbed by beginning counselor trainees who probably pre-, proclaim that they are psychodynamics in their orientation, that they're cognitive in their orientation, that they are Gestalt or rational-emotive, or behavioral in, in terms of their approach. I am fearful of this because are they saying that they perceive everyone in the same way and they work with everyone in the same way? Because for me, that would be inappropriate and incorrect. That would be rigidly applying a, ah, a theoretical template upon clients without consideration of their individual identity, their group identity and other factors, ah, cultural-political in terms of their life that they are going on, so I don't believe that it is very flattering for someone to say that, ah, "I'm a Gestaltist." "I'm a behaviorist." "I'm a cognitivist." "I'm a psychodynamic, uhm, ah, individual." What we are finding out is that in surveys, uhm, actual practitioners, actually those practicing in the field, over 70 percent classify themselves as eclectic, that is they blend different approaches in working, uhm, ah, with, their clients. Now to be eclectic is not to be random. It does not mean that you, as a helping professional, don't have a conceptual framework by which the repertoire of your strategies and techniques come from, but they have to be determined through an understanding of yourself as a racial-cultural being, the understanding of your client's world view and the understanding of their situational context from which it, ah, arises. So, cultural flexibility becomes key and important in terms of working on this. The second major implication that deals with the cultural, uhm, appropriate cultural, ah, intervention styles is to realize that being individual-centered, the individualism-collectivistic division, ah, that we talked about being individual, uhm, ah, centered often times forces us to locate the problem as residing in the client. The locus of the problem is in the individual, not in the large social system. The locus of responsibility for effecting change lies with the client and not in the social system. Multi-culture counseling and psychotherapy entertains a powerful, strong notion that the problem resides in the social system and perhaps it is the social system, whether it be the family, the group, the communities the, the organization that needs to be changed. If indeed you accept this premise because we are talking about, uhm, ah, ah, systemic factors that may be oppressive to our client, such as prejudice and racism, ah, then it says something else about a culturally appropriate intervention style, and that says that you as their counselor or therapist, if you are to be culturally relevant to a client who is being oppressed by the system must intervene in the system. You cannot simply, to be culturally relevant, be a traditional counselor or therapist. You have to begin to be an educator, an advocate, ah, a consultant, a facilitator of the indigenous healing resources, ah, ah, in the community, and this leads me to the third area that need to honestly begin to share. Ah, the facilitator of indigenous healing recognizes that there are non-Western indigenous forms of healing that we have ignored, delegitimized and don't use anymore. As I've indicated in an earlier videotape, all societies have, there had always been an existent in every culture and society natural help-giving networks. I call these non-Western indigenous methods of healing. We, Western counseling and psychotherapy is very recent and new, and many of these indigenous forms of healing have been delegitimized because we consider them supernatural and unscientific, but if you explore them greatly there is much commonality in terms of what healing is in these indigenous methods. So I encourage you, in this, ah, is something that we call the universal shamanic tradition. In one of my chapters that I talk about non-Western indigenous methods of healing, I tried to make a strong, powerful link between the similarities of traditional Western counseling and psychotherapy and what we can learn from indigenous methods of healing in which they believe that treatment, ah, should be within the whole system rather than, ah, ah, in the individual. So one of the things is that all of us, ah, if we are to become culturally confident must begin to reach out, form liaisons with people in the community, healers in the community who may enlighten us about how we can combine or work together to form, ah, effective treatment with individuals. Now, I've said this before that it would be great if we could be all things to everyone in our ability to work with them, but we all have limitations. If we do realize that we have limitations there are several things that we can do. One of them is that we can seek additional training and education. The second thing is to seek consultation with a more experienced counselor, cultural interpreter or advocate. If we do not have the skills or abilities to work effectively with our culturally diverse clients, we need to consider referring them out. But if you refer out, it is very important that you own up to the fact that it is your limitation, not the pathology or problem of the client that makes it difficult for both of you to continue together. And the last thing, I'd say, that is important is to become aware of your limitations and social impact upon, ah, ah, the culturally, ah, ah, diverse clientele that you will begin to work with. And I go back again to something that I repeatedly emphasized, that to be an effective multi-cultural counselor requires understanding of your own world view, the world view of culturally diverse clients that you work with and your ability to develop culturally appropriate interventions, strategies and helping styles in working with a pluralistic society that we currently live in. Thank you very much.
