JENNIFER ANDREWS My name is Jennifer Andrews and I'm going to read to you some notes sent to me by Michael White that hopefully will orient you towards this tape, Reauthoring Relationships Through Stories of Caring. Charles and Bridget, brother and sister, decided to seek consultation on their relationship, which was according to Bridget, stuck in cement. For a long time, the focus of this relationship was Charles' struggle with the effects of what had been diagnosed as schizophrenia. He had a history of hallucinations and hospitalizations and had been tried on a spectrum of medications. On many occasions over the years, it had been necessary for Bridget to intervene on his behalf; to get him out of locked facilities, to ensure that he got appropriate treatment when things were out of hand in his life, to demand action on the mismanagement of medications and on the dereliction of duty, to protect him from exploitation, and to challenge a range of other injustices including systems, neglect and abuse. Like many other relatives of people with such diagnoses who go through what Charles has, Bridget had been assigned conservatorship. Although she had always been concerned about the possible negative consequences of conservatorship and had experienced discomfort with many aspects of the role associated with it, conservatorship had given her some measure of power which had enabled her to ensure that the things that needed to be addressed for Charles were addressed. However, now both Bridget and Charles want to explore the possibilities for changing the status of their relationship. For her part, Bridget was uncomfortable with her feelings of being a big sister telling people what to do and of imposing her will and she had a strong desire to step back to a place in which she could be a more regular sister to Charles. She believed that the present arrangement was not satisfying to him and that she no longer knew how to make him feel better and that their conversations were going nowhere. For his part, Charles felt that Bridget was helping more than she needed to, that she was in his words overworking. He highly valued her presence in his life, wanted her to stay in it, but wanted her to move to the sidelines in a way that would change their roles and contribute to greater independence for him. How do people in Bridget and Charles' position negotiate a newer relationship arrangement in the face of so many forces that are reinforcing of the old relationship arrangement. This usually poses a significant dilemma. For a start, Charles' well being, his quality of life, and at times his very survival have been dependent upon Bridget's ability to take action on his behalf. Secondly, there are so many other people who spontaneously support the old definition of Bridget and Charles' relationship. For example, Bridget is routinely consulted by others about the events and the decisions of her brother's life and more than this, other people regularly encourage him to go ask your sister in relation to his uncertainties about the events and decisions of his life. In the first part of the meeting, Michael solicited an account of the history of Bridget and Charles' connection and sought clarification on their independent agendas for the conversation. As the account of the history of their connection unfolded, there was some opportunity to acknowledge Bridget's extraordinary contribution to Charles' life including the significance of her stand for justice. In the second part of the meeting, Michael followed up on his curiosity about why it was that both Charles and Bridget now wanted to renegotiate their relationship arrangement. He assumed that this quest was supported by certain events that were contributing to a foundation of new possibilities in their lives and their relationship. So, we set out to engage Charles and Bridget in a conversation that might be identifying of these events and that might render them more visible to Charles and Bridget. It was Michael's assumption that through the investigation of these events and through the attribution of meaning to them, Charles and Bridget's quest for a new relationship arrangement would be considerably advanced. To this end, Michael asked Charles what he thought it would mean for Bridget to go to the sidelines as Charles had put it. Charles said that he thought it would be good for her life as she would have time to look to herself. Bridget thanked him for this thoughtfulness. Thus began a conversation about Charles' intention to contribute to doing for Bridget what was in her best interests. In this conversation, a subplot was identified and considerably thickened, Charles' reciprocation of caring. It was discovered that recently when in court over a review of the conservatorship, Charles had asked the judge whether the procedures could be continued by mail because in attending court, Bridget was missing her classes. Charles has then told a story about his continued support of a girlfriend through a difficult time at some personal cost to him in regard to his living arrangements. And then Bridget and Charles shared a wonderful story about his relationship with their stepmother, one that culminated in his loving care of her through cancer, through dementia, and until her death. 

00:06:25
MICHAEL WHITE  When you said that it'd be good if your sister stayed on the sidelines as an observer, would that be a bit of a shift in the definition of your relationship? 

00:06:40
CHARLES Yes. 

00:06:40
MICHAEL WHITE That would be. Okay. And is that a recent thought that you've been having about a different place for your sister to be standing with you? 

00:06:50
CHARLES Well, I have thought that before. 

00:06:50
CHARLES Well, I have thought that before 

00:06:50
MICHAEL WHITE You've thought that for a long time? 

00:06:55
CHARLES Yes. Because I wanted to see her graduating and getting the kind of job she wants to and get other people besides doing me and her. 

00:07:05
CHARLES I want to see her graduating and getting the kind of job she wants...besides just doing me and her 

00:07:05
MICHAEL WHITE So, you've really been thinking about her life and about what would be good for her? 

00:07:10
CHARLES Yes. 

00:07:10
BRIDGET  Thank you. 

00:07:15
MICHAEL WHITE  Okay. I'm just wondering so you both have an idea about changing the definition of this relationship, you both have an idea? Does Charles' idea fit with your idea, I mean that version of it? 

00:07:35
BRIDGET If I knew what it meant. I think I'm saying that too that I've been defined as a caretaker and sometimes we have real emergency situations and what I've tried to change over the last two years is I would step in in a crisis and I got tired of problem solving in a crisis. So, I've tried to create a framework where there is a crisis and I can step back on the sideline. So, I'm still trying to learn how to do that. Yes. 

00:08:10
MICHAEL WHITE And that's been something you've been sort of working on in the last year or so. 

00:08:15
BRIDGET Two years, yes. It's hard. 

00:08:20
CHARLES It wasn't too bad at Landmark. Was it that bad at Landmark? 

00:08:20
 It wasn't too bad at Landmark* was it? Was it that bad? At Landmark? *(a locked facility) 

00:08:20
BRIDGET Landmark was great. Landmark was great. But I feel we got into Landmark because I received the conservatorship and I got on the phone and I was assertive in my own way and made sure that this program was available to my brother and --. 

00:08:40
CHARLES And Downey is okay, isn't it? 

00:08:40
 And Downey is okay, isn't it? (an unlocked facility he now lives at) 

00:08:40
BRIDGET Downey's great. But I'm methodical to the point of maybe being boring where you go from A to B to C and Mike at one point was stuck in a medical hospital and I had social workers telling me you're just not going to get him out of here. And we went to court and I had him out in one week and so he went to Landmark, which was a locked facility; to Downey, which is an unlocked facility and he's learning new skills and he's different. He's different in this last year. He's healthy, he's good, yes. 

00:09:15
CHARLES Well, I am a little heavy set. 

00:09:15
CHARLES Well, I'm a little heavy set 

00:09:15
BRIDGET Yes. So I'm really excited, I'm thinking maybe I can go on silence. This would be really wonderful. 

00:09:25
MICHAEL WHITE I understand about your caring, I understand that's very powerful caring and it's got a long history. 

00:09:30
CHARLES Too much so, too much. 

00:09:30
CHARLES Too much so 

00:09:30
MICHAEL WHITE  Sorry, what was that? 

00:09:35
CHARLES  I shouldn't worry about the future so much at this time. 

00:09:45
CHARLES I shouldn't have to worry about the future so much at this time 

00:09:45
MICHAEL WHITE Okay. And I understand that you're also a caring person. 

00:09:50
CHARLES Sometimes, yes. 

00:09:50
CHARLES Uhm, sometimes, yeah 

00:09:50
MICHAEL WHITE  And how does that -- you mentioned how Charles cares, why he cared for his girlfriend so much so that it got him into trouble. What's some other examples of Charles' care? 

00:10:10
CHARLES Like one time I was in this board and care home, which was a real bad house and this girl I gave a Members Only jacket to. 

00:10:20
CHARLES One time I was in this board and care house, which was a bad house..and I gave this girl a "Members Only" jacket 

00:10:20
BRIDGET Michael is always giving people things. But two things that were very meaningful to me. One, our stepmother had cancer and there was -- and she also had a stroke at the same time because of the chemo and Mike was home for a visit and then he cared. 

00:10:35
CHARLES  Yes, I remember that. 

00:10:40
CHARLES Yeah, I remember that 

00:10:40
BRIDGET And I was so happy Michael cared for her the whole weekend. He helped feed her and it was kind of their last connection before Betty started getting into real dementia and not remembering, going off into other memories. And then that's one that I will hold with me. That was not more than three, four months ago. 

00:11:00
CHARLES And remember her telling me three, four months ago. And one more before she does be in her heart and soul and that was --. 

00:11:10
CHARLES and one more time she said that I would be in her heart and soul... 

00:11:10
BRIDGET He was so sweet with her and he was so strong. 

00:11:15
CHARLES And she had a fractured hip, didn't she have a fractured hip after that? 

00:11:20
CHARLES and, didn't she have a fractured hip? 

00:11:20
BRIDGET No, but the cancer had gone to her brain and it was affecting the cortex. And then recently we had to go to court and when we go it was to renew the conservatorship and when we go, it's really hard because --. 

00:11:30
CHARLES  It isn't too bad. 

00:11:35
CHARLES It isn't too bad 

00:11:35
BRIDGET Okay. It's hard on me then because we're in this room with all these people and a lot of people have a lot of really hard problems and it's kind of us against this bureaucracy. And we're before the judge and the judge asks us each individually if we'd like to say something. And Michael says to this judge, I had to take the morning off here from school because the court tells you when to go, and Michael says to the judge is there any way we can do this through the mail because my sister's missing classes. So, he was concerned about me. Yes. 

00:12:10
CHARLES If you have to ever go again, at least go with Bill because it's a bad neighborhood down there. 

00:12:15
CHARLES If you ever have to go again, at least go with Bill, because the neighborhood is bad 

00:12:15
BRIDGET Yes. I think we'll just go together. 

00:12:20
MICHAEL WHITE You mentioned this weekend also where Charles cared for Betty or someone for the whole weekend and you said that you'd hold it in your heart. 

00:12:30
Prior to this point Bridget 

00:12:30
had said that she would 

00:12:30
hold Charles' expression of 

00:12:30
caring in her heart 

00:12:30
BRIDGET In my heart. 

00:12:30
CHARLES  No, I said that I'd be in her heart and soul. 

00:12:35
CHARLES No, I said that... I'd be in her heart and soul 

00:12:35
MICHAEL WHITE In your heart and soul, you're like her heart and soul. 

00:12:40
CHARLES No, no. I told my mother I'd be in her heart and soul. 

00:12:40
CHARLES No, I told my mother I'd be in her heart and soul 

00:12:40
MICHAEL WHITE You'd be in her heart and soul. 

00:12:40
BRIDGET  Yes. Michael and Betty had a very special relationship. 

00:12:50
CHARLES Yes, I did. Just a few years ago, we would go to the movies and stuff like that. 

00:12:55
CHARLES Yeah, just a few years ago. Yeah, we would go to the movies and stuff 

00:12:55
MICHAEL WHITE You had a very special relationship with each other. 

00:12:55
CHARLES I also had a best friend, his name was Richard, and me and him have known each other close to 20, 30 years. And I have another friend named Kurt, he's pretty cool too. Kurt and I were at the same treatment and he was kind of like frigid and everything and I got him out of his shell. 

00:13:15
CHARLES Also, I have a best friend, his name is Richard, and me and him have known each other almost 20 - 30 years and, I have another friend named Kurt, and he's pretty cool too Kurt was at this day treatment and he was kind of like, frigid and everything and, I got him out of his shell 

00:13:15
MICHAEL WHITE You got him out of his shell. 

00:13:20
CHARLES Yes. 

00:13:20
MICHAEL WHITE How did you do that? 

00:13:20
CHARLES Oh, by just hey buddy, how are you doing? Come on, let's go the group. And then I met this other guy at Landmark and his meds were kind of messed up and one night when I was given my morning medication, look I've got all these pills to take and swallowed it and he followed my footsteps and he got back on his medications again. 

00:13:40
CHARLES Oh, just by saying, "Hey buddy, how ya doing? Come on, let's get going. And then I met this guy at Landmark and his meds were kind of messed up and one night I was given my morning medication look-it, look-it all these pills to take... and he followed in my footsteps and he got back on his medications again 

00:13:40
MICHAEL WHITE So, he followed in your footsteps and so you were a bit like what would you say an older brother taking this up or --. 

00:13:45
CHARLES  Yes. 

00:13:50
MICHAEL WHITE So I've heard about a lot of your caring, but I'm also getting to hear about Charles' caring as well and like he was like a supportive friend to a couple of friends and he was very much in Betty's heart and soul and on that weekend before her death, he was there for her and he cared for her. You said that you'd hold that in your heart. That's a really important thing you'd hold in your heart. What does that do for you to hold that in your heart? 

00:14:20
BRIDGET It was really nice for me because Betty in my opinion gave her whole life to Michael, to caring for Michael. 

00:14:30
CHARLES And Joe and Nancy and Mary. 

00:14:30
CHARLES and Joe, Nancy and Mary (brother and sisters) 

00:14:30
BRIDGET  Yes. But you held a special place, that's just my opinion. And for Michael to give back and nobody expected that Michael could do this and you did it. Yes. I mean you showed them. So I was glad that they had that connection, yes. 

00:14:50
MICHAEL WHITE What did you think it was like for Betty to experience Charles giving back in the way that Charles gave back? 

00:14:55
BRIDGET I think it was real meaningful. 

00:15:00
MICHAEL WHITE It was real meaningful. I understand the significance of your caring and the importance of that and I don't know how strongly you've experienced that being honored. And I also understand that Charles has joined you in some way. He's playing a supportive friend and he he acknowledges that he put into practice in giving back to Betty in a way and that you really hold this in your heart. It's very significant to you because I guess it's what you stand for, would that be right? 

00:15:45
BRIDGET Yes. 

00:15:45
MICHAEL WHITE It fits within important values and so I understand and I guess I'm interested in asking -- one of the thoughts I had had to do with what you were saying about what was reflective about Charles, reflects his strengths. 

00:16:05
CHARLES Somewhat, yes. 

00:16:05
CHARLES Somewhat, yeah. 

00:16:05
MICHAEL WHITE Reflects some of his knowledges again and his knowledges of supporting people. I guess there are certain skills expressed in that and I'd like to understand more about some of those skills that you have. Would it be skills in caring, skills in supporting people? You're not going to do this right now, but if we were going to meet again if you're interested. 

00:16:30
CHARLES Maybe next time, okay. 

00:16:30
CHARLES Maybe next time okay? 

00:16:30
MICHAEL WHITE Would you be in another occasion be interested in us getting to understand some of these skills and knowledges that you are using in giving back in the way that you are? Would that be interesting to you? 

00:16:40
CHARLES Maybe, maybe not. I'm not sure. 

00:16:45
CHARLES Maybe, maybe not. I'm not sure. 

00:16:45
MICHAEL WHITE Can I ask you another question? Because I don't know in some ways in your connection with Charles, the -- where do you directly personally experience his expressions of caring for you? You mentioned in court and that was pretty important for you to hear that, wasn't it? 

00:17:10
BRIDGET Yes, very important. 

00:17:10
MICHAEL WHITE Really important for you to hear that. Do you understand why it was so important for you to hear what Charles said in court? 

00:17:15
BRIDGET Sure. Yes, because I don't usually hear it. 

00:17:20
MICHAEL WHITE You don't usually hear it. 

00:17:20
BRIDGET No. Remember Michael talked about his assertiveness training where would you say it's a monologue that you play? 

00:17:25
CHARLES Like a broken record. 

00:17:25
CHARLES Like a broken record. 

00:17:25
BRIDGET  Like a broken record. So a lot of times I hear the broken record and I feel like I'm playing tennis. Bridget, will you do, will you do? So it's will you do and I go no. Will you do it, no. So it was really nice to hear that Michael was concerned about me. 

00:17:45
Charles leaves for a 

00:17:45
brief break 

00:17:45
MICHAEL WHITE Just wondering what the outcome for you to experience some of that coming back from Charles and could you say a bit more about what that was like for you about why it was so important for you to experience that? 

00:18:00
BRIDGET  Because it was a time that somebody was concerned about me instead of my always doing for everybody. So I was just really surprised that he said that because I feel like I get lost in the caretaking. There's been so many emergencies and then because he plays the broken record, I don't know what's going to happen. He has these hopes and dreams and yet in some respects, he's not doing that well in his program right now and then I have family members that care about me and my husband -- my husband's always really concerned about my being too hopeful that I will get crushed because there is only so much that can happen. So, to hear the work you do and the work I'm studying that creates is a difference. It fits more with the hopefulness that I carry with me. 

00:19:05
MICHAEL WHITE  And that was like a difference that really fits with the hopefulness then? 

00:19:10
BRIDGET  Yes. Maybe we can have something more than crisis left in the time we have on this earth and maybe he can be a little bit more independent. 

00:19:20
Charles has returned 

00:19:20
from his break 

00:19:20
MICHAEL WHITE  Do you think it's a positive thing or a negative thing that you actually join Bridget in the way that you have? 

00:19:30
CHARLES Positive. 

00:19:30
CHARLES Positive 

00:19:30
MICHAEL WHITE That you've joined her in caring in the way that you do. 

00:19:35
CHARLES I want to make decisions on my own. 

00:19:35
CHARLES I want to make decisions on my own 

00:19:35
MICHAEL WHITE  Sorry? 

00:19:40
CHARLES I want to make decisions on my own especially the independent living part. 

00:19:40
CHARLES I want to make decisions on my own especially the independent living part 

00:19:40
MICHAEL WHITE Okay. So why do you think it's positive that you've joined. Why would you say it's positive that you've joined Bridget in the way that you have around expressing caring and giving back in the way that you have? 

00:19:55
CHARLES I don't know. 

00:19:55
CHARLES Uh, I don't know. 

00:19:55
MICHAEL WHITE Is it something that you've always wanted to do. 

00:19:55
CHARLES Yes. 

00:19:55
MICHAEL WHITE It is. Okay. Alright. If we had a little longer to talk, I'd be interested in asking you both questions that help me understand what some of Charles' skills in caring for others and giving back in the way that he has and being a supportive friend in the way that he has and I'd be interested in knowing more about what it was like for you to experience that from Charles and so we get to understand the importance of that and I'd want to know more about what that was doing to your relationship. Could I just ask about Charles' present time? What do you think that did to your connection with Charles to experience that giving back from him in court, to experience that giving back to Betty in the way that you experienced? Did you see that affecting the definition of your relationship? You said it was a very positive thing and you're holding it in your heart. 

00:20:55
BRIDGET For me, I think it made us more equal. 

00:20:55
CHARLES I sometimes worry about my father being alone. 

00:21:00
CHARLES I sometimes worry about my father being alone 

00:21:00
MICHAEL WHITE Okay. So you're concerned about him as well. So that concern actually -- 

00:21:05
CHARLES There are so many break-ins nowadays. There's people robbing house. 

00:21:05
CHARLES there are so many break-ins now 

00:21:05
BRIDGET  Yes, yes. 

00:21:10
MICHAEL WHITE So this concern -- these shared concerns make you more equal. 

00:21:15
BRIDGET I think so. 

00:21:20
MICHAEL WHITE And that fits more with the definition of the relationship that you really want to have with Charles? 

00:21:25
BRIDGET Right because Michael wants to make his own decisions and what I really want is that Michael be able to make his own decisions and that we can just be brother and sister. 

00:21:35
CHARLES  Well, that's good. 

00:21:40
CHARLES Well, that's good. 

00:21:40
BRIDGET So and I am nothing in that when he just thought I was one more parent. 

00:21:40
CHARLES No, I didn't. I was talking to the people in the alternative program and I told them it would have to be okay with you. 

00:21:50
CHARLES No, I didn't. I was talking to the people in the alternative program and I told them it would have to be okay with you 

00:21:50
BRIDGET Okay. So it worked. Good. 

00:21:50
CHARLES  Would you think it would be better possibly if I went to alternatives or maybe something more structured like the California Living Homes that we have in Melbourne? 

00:22:00
CHARLES Would you think it would be better possibly, if I went to alternatives or something more structured like the California Living Homes? 

00:22:00
BRIDGET Might be really important what you tell me. 

00:22:05
Reflecting Team 

00:22:05
group who have been 

00:22:05
watching come in to 

00:22:05
reflect 

00:22:05
JENNIFER ANDREWS There was a reflecting team present at this meeting. This team was a group of therapists who had been an audience to the conversation between Charles, Bridget, and Michael. At this point in the meeting, it was Charles and Bridget's turn to become an audience to the team's responses to their conversation. Reflecting teams are essentially a listening group that engages in a retelling of what has been heard. This is a retelling in which the stories of people's lives are linked around shared themes, purposes, and commitments. Here this retelling contributes to a rich description of Charles and Bridget's relationship and of the subplot that is Charles' reciprocation of caring. 

00:22:50
It is now Charles' 

00:22:50
and Bridget's turn 

00:22:50
to become an 

00:22:50
audience to the 

00:22:50
team 

00:22:50
MICHAEL WHITE Really interested in your thoughts and your responses and if it's okay, I wouldn't mind asking you a question or two about them. So I'd like to know what your thoughts are. 

00:23:00
 If I could just start off with one thing. Bridget and Charles remind me very much of my relationship with my sister although we aren't in a caretaker relationship, but I'm envious of the two of them for having this close relationship. My sister lives on the East Coast, 3000 miles away and there's a great deal of synergy when the two of us get together. 

00:23:30
MICHAEL WHITE So, this had you thinking about your sister. 

00:23:35
 Over and over again, yes. And the two of us will probably have to work very closely in the future with my parents getting up in years and needing some care for them. 

00:23:45
MICHAEL WHITE Alright, okay. So what was it that you heard that had you thinking so much about your relationship with your sister? I mean what did you hear from Charles and Bridget. 

00:24:00
 Well, of course, the first thing that clicked in is that Bridget is the older sister so my sister is older than me. She is the only sister that I have and it's just this special relationship that seemed to be coming across to me that I was really envious of, of being able to work with a sister that closely. It's different. I've never met another woman like my sister. Something about flesh and blood thinking alike. We can get together and tell stories, we have a common history that goes back, she can tell me about what it was like when I was a child, gaps in my background that she can fill in and I can fill in for her. 

00:24:50
MICHAEL WHITE So there's something about what happened here that somehow triggered off those images about your sister for you. 

00:24:55
  Yes. 

00:25:00
MICHAEL WHITE And it had to do with what Bridget and Charles were expressing about their relationship with each other? 

00:25:05
  It's partly that, but it's also just the presence of the two of them sitting together and watching the eye motions and the comfortableness that they have with each other and sometimes the friction that they've talked about. I remember struggling with my sister when I was a lot younger. 

00:25:25
MICHAEL WHITE  Did it have appreciating you your relationship with your sister like when you were --? 

00:25:35
 Very much so. 

00:25:35
MICHAEL WHITE What did this experience have you appreciating about your relationship with your sister? 

00:25:40
 Well, the theme of caring for each other, it's a mutual caring that came out. My sister and I are the same way. We'll talk on the phone for long periods of time just trying to reinforce each other, learn something about the struggles that each of us is going through and give some suggestions back and forth. 

00:26:05
MICHAEL WHITE Okay. So I feel like asking you many other questions, but I'm really interested in what this really evoked for you in being an audience to this conversation. So, it's good to hear some of that. 

00:26:20
 What it evoked for me was raising my consciousness about how important it is for us to be concerned and responsible for each other and we never know who's going to be responsible next, but we have to be open to that. And it feels like Bridget and Charles are open to being responsible for others and sometimes one is more responsible than the other and it really doesn't matter who does that piece, but someone needs to fit in there. 

00:26:55
MICHAEL WHITE Can you just tell me why it was important for Bridget to experience Charles taking some responsibility for her in the way that he did in court? Do you understand --? 

00:27:05
 Absolutely, because I'm an elder sister and sometimes I ache for somebody in the family to look at me and say oh, maybe you need something today and it doesn't happen in my family and I can really respond to that. Yes. 

00:27:20
MICHAEL WHITE  So how did you feel when you heard the story about Charles in court saying look, I got to take my sister's needs into account and her life is really important and how can we -- like almost inviting the court to join him in caring for her in a way. I mean what was that like for you? 

00:27:40
 Well, it felt like life was fair for once. Yes. 

00:27:45
MICHAEL WHITE  Would you like to experience some of it as an older sister? 

00:27:50
  Yes. But I also can identify with Bridget's struggle around fulfilling a role that probably was given to her as a very little child and I really respect the fact that she's saying hey, I don't need or want to do this anymore. Let's take a look at how we can do this differently and giving Charles credit for having the courage and the energy and the capacity to do more for himself. 

00:28:25
MICHAEL WHITE Yes, okay. I guess it's just a little bit hard to step back from that and let others step into it. I was interested in the way that Charles did step into it giving that back. 

00:28:35
 They're very courageous people. 

00:28:40
[sil.] 

00:28:45
Bridget and Charles 

00:28:45
return 

00:28:45
BRIDGET Well, maybe I'm the person that learned a lot today. Michael does go through a lot of groups and a lot of therapies and he could probably run therapy groups, that's how much knowledge he has. But I wanted to learn more about us. I am not used to looking at our relationship as special and I think that's the way I look at it now. I give it real honor and I really appreciate being told how special we are, I didn't realize that. I mean I guess sometimes --. 

00:29:20
CHARLES Why even after that plane crash, I was worried about you. That plane crash in New York. 

00:29:25
CHARLES Why, even after that plane crash, I was worried about you, that plane crash in New York 

00:29:25
BRIDGET Yes. 

00:29:25
MICHAEL WHITE Some more examples. So what didn't you realize that --? 

00:29:30
BRIDGET I guess sometimes I can get so caught up in the work that I don't realize that we're really a very special team and what kept going off in my mind was okay Bridget, it's time to get behind Michael instead of ahead of him because when I've had to protect him, I had to be ahead of him like Joan of Arc. 

00:29:50
CHARLES Yes, really and that's too much. 

00:29:50
CHARLES Yeah, really, and that's too much. 

00:29:50
BRIDGET I don't need to do it, right. 

00:29:50
CHARLES  You can't get your work done and work on me at the same time. 

00:29:55
CHARLES You can't get your work done and do this at the same time 

00:29:55
MICHAEL WHITE What was it that put you in touch with those realizations, Bridget? 

00:30:00
BRIDGET  Nobody has ever said that they appreciated our experience or what we go through and really honored Michael's efforts as well as mine. And it really helped me see that we are collaborating. 

00:30:20
MICHAEL WHITE  So something about being an audience to the team's comments that brought forth some very important realizations for you. 

00:30:30
BRIDGET It did for me, yes. I've really had it brought to my attention that our work together has been good and has been special and the news of difference for me is that Mike is getting stronger and stronger and I can go ahead and --. 

00:30:50
CHARLES Oh, Bridget, what do you think of those pamphlets I gave you from some of those places? 

00:30:50
CHARLES Oh, Bridget, what do you think of those pamphlets from some of those places? 

00:30:50
BRIDGET  Yes. Michael gives me many pamphlets. He gathers information and I keep that information. So I can allow Mike to find out all the information he needs for his next move and gather it all up and tell me what he wants and we'll explore it if that's okay. 

00:31:10
MICHAEL WHITE So, there's so much I'd like to ask you about that, but I can't because we have to stop. 

00:31:20
CHARLES Well, next time. 

00:31:20
CHARLES Well, next time. 

00:31:20
MICHAEL WHITE If there was a next time, that would be wonderful. I don't know if there will be or not, Charles. 

00:31:25
CHARLES Well, it was nice meeting you. Are you into any sports or anything like surfing or anything like that? 

00:31:30
CHARLES Well, it was nice meeting you... Are you into any sports or anything? ...like surfing or anything like that? 

00:31:30
MICHAEL WHITE I used to, yes. 

00:31:30
CHARLES  Surfing? 

00:31:35
MICHAEL WHITE Yes. 

00:31:35
CHARLES Well, what's the best beach you like to surf in? Melbourne? 

00:31:35
CHARLES Well, what's the best beach you like to surf? Melbourne? 

00:31:35
MICHAEL WHITE  No. Lots of beaches. Bells beach in Victoria. 

00:31:45
CHARLES I surfed a little bit in the 1960s. 

00:31:50
CHARLES I surfed a little bit in the sixties 

00:31:50
MICHAEL WHITE Did you? We've been surfing at the same time. I'm 48. You're 46. 

00:31:55
CHARLES 46, yes.. 

00:31:55
MICHAEL WHITE That's not a big difference. 

00:31:55
CHARLES  Do you in Australia rent some independent living place? 

00:32:00
CHARLES Do you in Australia rent some independent living places? 

00:32:00
MICHAEL WHITE  Yes, there would be some. There would be. 

00:32:05
BRIDGET  So, Mike will be asking (inaudible ). 

00:32:15
CHARLES I wish I could, I wouldn't mind. 

00:32:15
CHARLES I wish I could... I wouldn't mind... 

00:32:15
MICHAEL WHITE It would be great to see you. Thinking about coming to Adelaide to join me in Adelaide. So yes, we have independent living places. I just want to just I guess make a comment that I've really enjoyed meeting with you both and I've had the opportunity to appreciate your connection with each other and what we stand for. And that's been a privilege for me to be connecting with you around that and I felt that the team members also triggered off some of the questions that maybe I'd have too about your experiences of this and your experiences of the team, I'll have to give to Jennifer or someone here and they can maybe catch you up with here. 

00:33:05
BRIDGET That would be wonderful. 

00:33:10
CHARLES And we might film again sometime? 

00:33:10
CHARLES ...and we might film again sometime? 

00:33:10
MICHAEL WHITE Sorry? 

00:33:10
CHARLES We might film again sometime? 

00:33:10
MICHAEL WHITE I'm sure there'd be a possibility of it. Would you be into that? 

00:33:15
CHARLES Maybe sometime. 

00:33:15
CHARLES ...maybe sometime... 

00:33:15
BRIDGET You're going to get more used to this and you're getting into it now. 

00:33:20
MICHAEL WHITE I guess the thing that I was connecting with is the caring that you both stand for in a world where there's an absence of that. In fact many of you should practice it. 

00:33:35
[sil.] 

00:33:40
FOLLOW-UP 

00:33:40
ONE YEAR LATER 

00:33:40
(Charles was not 

00:33:40
available for the 

00:33:40
meeting) 

00:33:40
JENNIFER ANDREWS I had asked you if you would look over the tape or maybe look over the tape with your brother and kind of comment on what parts of the tape felt important to you. 

00:33:45
BRIDGET  I was really surprised at really how things have changed. I think I was surprised because I hadn't been thinking consciously of things, events the way that our relationship goes that it had changed, but it really has. 

00:34:05
JENNIFER ANDREWS For the better? 

00:34:05
BRIDGET For the better, absolutely for the better. And really taken a step to the sidelines, this is actually something that Michael says, my brother says in the tape. He'd like to see me on the sidelines. Well, I am definitely on the sidelines. 

00:34:25
JENNIFER ANDREWS What does that mean? Like what you said before, he wanted you to back out more? 

00:34:30
BRIDGET Right. Michael makes a comment that I overwork in a situation and I've really backed off big time. So that it's just --. 

00:34:40
JENNIFER ANDREWS In what ways? 

00:34:45
BRIDGET Well, he's now in the community, he's in the residence he wanted to be in, so this is all really good news. 

00:34:50
JENNIFER ANDREWS  How did that happen? 

00:34:55
BRIDGET It happened it must have been right because that conversation we had here with Michael White. The social worker took my brother to see the residence, there was an opening. I interviewed with the director and I think he was a little concerned about me. 

00:35:15
JENNIFER ANDREWS You didn't even want to move in. 

00:35:20
BRIDGET Right. That maybe I would be too much of a hands-on, they're not used to people family members like that. Told him I've never had anyone I could trust to do that work with Mike and if he could do the work with Mike, I'd really appreciate it. I do have other things I'd like to do. So -- and then the only other thing he said was that my brother would have to follow the rules and that was the part I was really concerned about. And so Michael moved in last April, this is October, and the first two weeks were real shaky and probably the hardest times I've experienced in the recent past because it's really a compliment to him. He just went off and started doing his thing, but he was supposed to be following some rules and so we had a very difficult conversation where I pretty much lost it. I just said look, I don't have any other place to turn. The residence director called me and said well, Mike can't follow the rules so he's got two weeks here and I thought well, he's got two weeks there, I'm leaving this alone. And Mike settled down and settled down, we kind of had a rough talk where I just said this is it and I don't know what else to do so if you don't -- if you cannot find a way to work with me, I don't know what's going to happen. 

00:36:45
JENNIFER ANDREWS  So, you say he just settled down. Do you have any sense of how that happened like what contributed to him settling down? 

00:36:55
BRIDGET I was really upset. I think it's the caring. What I took from that first interview when I walked out the door was this whole message of caring. I was not looking at my brother and I as in a caring relationship. Nobody had really highlighted that for us before. And so despite the problem and it was so emotional and I was really upset and he knew it and he cried. 

00:37:25
JENNIFER ANDREWS He cared too. 

00:37:25
BRIDGET He cared. So when I put my head down on the steering wheel, it was like this is it. He said okay, I'll go back, I'll talk to the director, it's going to be alright. There was something else where he talked about sort of being the broken record and asking questions over and over again. That's really stopped. That's really stopped. 

00:37:45
JENNIFER ANDREWS  Because it seemed like that was like part of the illness. 

00:37:50
BRIDGET Right. He was sitting right here and I think he really got it and I was saying God, that's so hard. So, he was -- he wanted to know when we were going Christmas shopping and he called me and I said not till the middle of November. 

00:38:05
JENNIFER ANDREWS That's it. 

00:38:05
BRIDGET  But see there was a time when he called me three times a day and asked when are we going Christmas shopping. He said I have my calendar here and so we put it on the calendar for November I think 13th and he won't ask again. And we had a birthday party for him which was that's in October, October 8th. So that's one year in the film, we've come one year and this was real interesting. I gave him gift certificates from everyone to various stores because then he can pick out what he wants and if he doesn't want that, it's like cash so he has a gift but nobody's made him have anything. And so my dad is sitting at my house and he's saying to my brother I really think your sister should take your gifts until you go shopping together, that he can't be trusted. And I turned to Mike and said what do you want to do? He says I can handle it and I said okay and I walked out of the room. And when I picked him up for shopping, he had all this. He hadn't lost them, he didn't trade them, he didn't throw them away. We have family parties and most of the family has really dreaded when Mike was going to be there because it would be either they're asking lot of questions sort of getting in their face. I mean my husband said last party we had, he'd be sitting with a group and then if he wanted a cigarette, he'd go off where the smoke wouldn't bother anybody, it was fun. And it was nice that my husband noticed because after 30 years of his experiences, Bill's at the point where sometimes he's had enough. He's a nice guy so for him to notice gee, your brother was no problem and he was just part of the family and everything went well, that's saying a lot. In our relationship, I think the words I used we were stuck like in cement, we're not stuck in cement. 

00:40:10
JENNIFER ANDREWS How would you describe it now? 

00:40:15
BRIDGET I have moved three giant paces back. As a matter of fact, I might even want to come a little bit closer, but I'm just allowing Mike to live his life. I don't ask a lot of questions. We went back to court just a month ago and it was real casual and there was another family there that Michael knew with a man about his age and I sort of felt that the mother of this man was rude to Mike. Mike went to get in line. They treat you like cattle over there and you got to sort of hang out and then they'd make you all line up and so Mike was sort of at the front of the line. It always takes me a little bit longer to get in line and I think this woman sort of told him to move. Well, this man was a friend of my brother's and I had brought a bottle of water each for us and we're waiting our turn in front of the judge and Mike turns to me and he says can I have that bottle of water. I said sure and I gave it up. He gives it to this man, he's say he's having some problems and he needs this for his medication. So, he's not looking just out for me, he's looking out for his friend and I'm thinking and I said to my husband because my hackles were sort of up and I thought here this woman is being rude to him and he's looking out for her son. I'm a lot more hopeful than I was before, yes. 

00:41:55
JENNIFER ANDREWS That's what you said also, so is he. 

00:41:55
BRIDGET And I take the relationship as caring now. For a few weeks after I left that initial session, that was sort of my mantra. I thought wow, I never thought of it that way.
