Resolving Identity Conflicts Through the "Tetra Lemma" 

00:00:20
Robert Dilts 

00:00:30
ROBERT DILTS So, hello everybody, welcome. Thank you for coming here this afternoon, I am Robert Dilts, and I wanna do a demo here this afternoon on working with sort of this notion of uh… identity conflicts and in particular this notion of the dilemmas that can emerge. Umm… the, in, in the conversation hour that I had this morning, people were asking about, really, really sort of discussion about the difference between identity and identification and obviously I think one of the things that we often are dealing with and confronting in the areas of psycho therapy and coaching. Our conflicts that emerge between various kinds of sub personalities and ego states that we have, so we will, in, in my uh… background practice in neuro linguistic programming NLP. We frequently use the term aparts to, acknowledge existence of the these various kinds of sub-personalities, different parts of ourselves and frequently , especially in times of transition, crisis change, these parts come into conflict. Uh… so that they are in, in, this has to do in sometimes from this dynamic from where I have become identified with certain way of being, identified with certain values, identified with certain umm… a aspect of either acting or thinking and when I am in certain situations I get into a sort of a dilemma. Sometimes that dilemma happens because I have to, you know, very different desires or urges what we would call an NLP, different intentions or some part of me has an intention. For example, to protect myself and other part has an intention to grow or to be more free etcetera, and then these two things end up in, in a conflict and uh… obviously what sometimes happens is we try to resolve the conflict by choosing one part over another. We try to uh… take one expression and sort of diminish the other and, and try to push forward in onside. The problem and the challenge with that is that of course it's umm… I am creating sometimes a type of a, a worst situation. Because, especially if I am suppressing some side of myself, it's going into a more unconscious expression and then can erupt in ways that I am not gonna be able to predict and ends up emerging as a kind of a self sabotage, or what we call a sort of an internal terrorist if you will. So, the thing I would like to present is a way of working with these kind of dilemmas umm… that is based upon a, a Buddhist practice that is known as a Tetra Lemma, and it's an expression of both some principles of uh… NLP, neuro linguistic programming. But also some principles of what if the work that I do with Steve Gilligan in our generative coaching process. And uh… this, the, the idea of a Tetra Lemma, the term die in Greek, die means two, lemma means points essentially. And so a dilemma is two points, Tetra means four. And so, what you're trying to do is turn something that has only two points into four points. And these four points then have a, a very interesting potential impact in freeing us from a certain kind of dualistic thinking where again, where, you know, there's, there's the old terminology, we're caught on the horns of a dilemma, we're caught with only two possibilities. And so the purpose of this is to in a way help to get us outside of the box. So first part of it is being able to be aware of, more aware of what is the dilemma, what are the sub personalities involved in that dilemma what kinds of beliefs are involved that, you that again usually create a sub personality. What we were saying is today is that on an identity level, the notion of identity means in Greek, sorry in Latin "iden" means the same, it's an essence of me that's always the same. So normally you would think that if you have, you have a single identity how could you have a conflict in an identity level. And this is where we become identified with certain kind as I said identified, with certain kinds of beliefs, certain kinds of expressions. So once we can sort these kind of different identifications, we can then look at what we call the positive intention that they serve, so instead of trying to suppress one and, you know, uh… support another, we're actually able to hold both simultaneously. Uh… oftentimes these sub personalities emerge in a kind of a, of a Good Self, Bad Self sort of dilemma, umm… what we would call this sort of idealized self versus a shadow. And uh… so just to give an example before we just do the demo, uh… there was a woman I was working with who was really struggling over a desire to quit smoking. And so on the one hand she was saying well smoking, it's a disgusting habit, you know, it's, I, I, I really truly am disgusted by the fact that I smoke. However, when she would try to quit she would say but I, but I find that, you know, having a cigarette, it's so delicious, right it's delicious. So she was kind of stuck in this dilemma, smoking is disgusting but it's also delicious, and so she would keep going back and forth and end up in the struggle and, and not go anywhere. So that's the dilemma, I find smoking both disgusting, disgusting and I find it delicious. So now what do I do, I, I can if I stay in that dilemma I go around and around in circles. So first step is to, we would say truly acknowledge these two sides and give them a place so in the, in the Tetra Lemma you start with, with this is true. And then there's the contrary to that, it's disgusting but on the contrary it's also delicious. And you kind of really acknowledge the truth value of both of those, rather than trying to say yes you're right it's disgusting, let's try to figure out how to get rid of it, how to change that. And, you know, make it, you know, kind of aligned with the so-called positive self, the good self and try to get rid of the bad self. You actually hold a space for both and this is where you get to the tri lemma, the third position is this is true or that's true, both are true. And you're more than that, and that becomes very interesting stuff, right. So I can hold both and when you hold both at the same time in NLP this is typically called a Meta position, or third position. In this third position I recognize that both are parts of me but I am actually more than either one, right, so there's more than that. And then the fourth part of the dilemma is actually rather an interesting place because it goes, uh… you step into a place where we would in NLP say the map is never the territory, it's actually a map to say that it's disgusting or that is delicious. And so we do a kind of what Albert Einstein would call a thought experiment, a thought experiment is I go to a fourth position which would be it's neither disgusting nor is it delicious. Can I actually enter into the flame of mind where smoking is neither disgusting nor it's delicious. And what happens there is you are sort of out side of the box of the dilemma and a whole space of possibilities opens up. So that you're no longer in this dualistic perspective, you know that it's bad, good or, you know, something like that. Suddenly there's this whole new perspective and the completion point is actually uh… being in the middle of all four points of you. Now in this case and this is where I think the, the legacy of Erickson comes in. You, you're not trying to in that moment make a, a decision of the conscious mind. You're allowing the creative unconscious now to hold that and then the question becomes, so what Erickson would say, we become very curious to discover what's possible, so I'd like to show how we do that uh… and we have our, a volunteer. That's true, it is. Volunteer to be our demo. So if you would like to come up as to, thank you. And umm… it's going to be a good idea to put that, put that in a pocket or something because I'm probably going to be using both hands. So thank you. 

00:10:10
ASTRID CYNTHIA Hi. 

00:10:10
ROBERT DILTS Maybe no, I'm not so sure, I should, I, I know that it's, it's a very different perspective to move from there to here but I find that this is usually the best seat in the house. 

00:10:20
ASTRID CYNTHIA Let's see. 

00:10:20
ROBERT DILTS Look at all these wonderfully supporting people. So, now, now usually by the way there are different ways to do this but I actually, I have given the, the work that Steven and I do with generative coaching. We and I, and I was saying earlier today that identity things are usually more than just cognitive, you want to involve the body as well. So I usually like to do the standing up, that's okay. 

00:10:45
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yup. 

00:10:45
ROBERT DILTS And, and so, if we could come here, what we're going to do as for it is we're going to start by having a sort of a middle point and then you will kind of mark out the Dilemma. And we'll put one side of the Dilemma on one side, one on the other and then what we'll do is actually the third position will be sort of standing back from both, sort of looking at both. And the fourth position is sort of leaving both behind. And just really exploring what happens with that and I think will be very, very interesting. Now the starting place since we're up here in front of uh… a group of people is uh… we always like to say in any of the coaching processes we do, we start in what we call the coach state, which I think, I see some of you nodding that you've probably heard of this before. Coach state is some, it's an acronym for being centered, open, aware, connected and sort of able to hold a space. And so again, since, before we start trying to sort out any of these kind of inner places, inner conflict within you. Let's just take a moment, and, and I invite you guys by the way to join us too. It's always a nice way I, I found that It's a, you get a lot more out of observing a demonstration if you're centered open, aware, especially at this time of day uh… to be alert, aware and then connected and sort of holding a space for exploration in curiosity. So centering the easiest way to center is just bringing uh, awareness to the center of the body and the actual physical center of the body is in the belly, halfway between the top of the head and the bottom of the feet. And usually when you bring your attention there, there's a kind of almost an immediate sense of a type of calming. And then it's up to open we often say, you start by opening the heart center, opening the chest. Uh… to be alert usually starts in the head center, all the distance receptors are in the head, the eyes, ears, nose, mouth. We bring that awareness to the whole body. And then this idea of connecting, connecting head, heart, belly, feet that sense of a whole person, because our, our ultimate goal of this kind of work is to become more whole, right, to become more integrated, to become more fully ourselves. And then the each of the coach state us just to be ready to hold a space. And I usually like to in, in any of this kind of coaching conversation or therapeutic conversation, when we're both able to be in that state well enough we just acknowledge it by saying, "I'm ready or I'm here." So I stood umm… I'm here and I'm ready. 

00:13:35
ASTRID CYNTHIA Mm-hm. 

00:13:35
ROBERT DILTS Are you here? 

00:13:35
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:13:35
ROBERT DILTS You ready? 

00:13:35
ASTRID CYNTHIA I am ready. 

00:13:40
ROBERT DILTS Okay, I see you, I believe you. So I should… uh… let's, let's begin to explore where, you know, where is this dilemma, where is the dilemma that you're facing and, and usually people can't, you know, necessarily start off by going my dilemma is A versus B sometimes. But a lot of times it's more, you want to kind of start with where it's the life circumstance, and then we can help to sort of find the dilemma from that so. 

00:14:05
ASTRID CYNTHIA So my dilemma is umm… oops. 

00:14:10
[sil.] 

00:14:15
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:14:20
ASTRID CYNTHIA That I, I don't know if I, if I really want to start so, and how to get started with my professional work. 

00:14:25
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:14:30
ASTRID CYNTHIA Umm… and how to step out or if I really like to step out of my, comfort, comfort zone, umm… 

00:14:35
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:14:40
ASTRID CYNTHIA Because I also, there's also this other side, just enjoying life and umm… 

00:14:45
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:14:50
ASTRID CYNTHIA Just enjoying the moment being not responsible for anything, just enjoying life and that I'm here umm… 

00:14:55
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:14:55
ASTRID CYNTHIA Resting, umm… 

00:15:00
ROBERT DILTS So we, we begin to hear a little bit, I mean from the, again from this is, as we listen. Astrid Cynthia I want to get started with something, I want to step out of my comfort zone into a professional life, at the same time I'm happy in my comfort zone. I feel like there's a aspect of just wanting to be present of enjoying what I'm doing. 

00:15:20
ASTRID CYNTHIA yeah, I am traveling, enjoying the states. I moved last year here. 

00:15:25
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:15:30
ASTRID CYNTHIA So, umm… but I am also so curious about working and using my english and working with clients so, and also asking, asking for clients. 

00:15:35
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:15:35
ASTRID CYNTHIA So, can I really ask for clients, umm… 

00:15:40
ROBERT DILTS So we actually hear there is another little bit of a dilemma. 

00:15:40
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:15:45
ROBERT DILTS I want to ask for something but do I really want to? 

00:15:50
ASTRID CYNTHIA So, it also, it's, it's it relates to, can I ask for it umm… 

00:15:55
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, carry on. 

00:15:55
ASTRID CYNTHIA So, guess not, not to me, there are not many things in my life, I, I really ask for. 

00:16:00
ROBERT DILTS Uh-huh. 

00:16:05
ASTRID CYNTHIA I did all the stuff on my own so… 

00:16:05
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:16:05
ASTRID CYNTHIA This, but now I know that there is some, there are some I have to ask, I have to, to show myself also umm… asking me to, to show myself, to, to tell about myself what I am, what I am able to do and… 

00:16:20
ROBERT DILTS Sort of be visible. 

00:16:25
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:16:25
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:16:25
ASTRID CYNTHIA Umm… yeah. 

00:16:25
ROBERT DILTS So we sort of hear, even to hear that there's, that's why we say it's sort of two different aspects of Astrid. One is I want to get out there, I want to get started, I want to begin, you know, begin this new professional life, I want to, you know, become visible, I want to ask for things. On the other side, well, I'm kind of happy with, you know, I'm enjoying traveling and resting and, and do I really deserve to ask I don't know, you didn't have to say the word deserve but I am, you know, can I ask is the way you put it. So let's begin to sort this out a little bit because what you can hear even right now is that as Astrid talks about one side, the other side kind of, they're sort of already, immediately comes up. And one of the biggest challenges with this kind of Dilemmas is, there as soon as I go to one side, the other side is there and so I can never actually explore them cleanly in a way, because they're sort of always cut, you know, be like two people immediately interrupting each other the moment one begins to speak. 

00:17:25
ASTRID CYNTHIA So also my right leg is shaking the whole time. 

00:17:30
ROBERT DILTS Yes. 

00:17:30
ASTRID CYNTHIA So this is the resting side… 

00:17:30
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:17:35
ASTRID CYNTHIA … which lies so, so badly to rest. 

00:17:35
ROBERT DILTS That somebody may have already noticed that through that, actually Astrid was already sort of beginning to when she talked about one thing she would use one hand and the other very often you're going to see this that we are spontaneously sort these into you know the, the, this internal uh, experiences are already showing on the outside. So let's, let's start with, if we took a step to the left first and this would be the side we are going at and step on out. And I want to show myself, I want to start this new part of my professional life, I've come to the United, I wanna begin this new life. There's a truth to that isn't there? You really do want to do that. 

00:18:20
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah, and I, I want to practice, I did so many seminars, I have so many certificates and I really enjoyed and, now I, now I am a yoga teacher, I just did it and I want to combine it and use all my skills. So… 

00:18:30
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, no, by the way notice, you're going to also see that there is a spontaneous posture, this right. I'm ready, right. I want to, I am going to do this. 

00:18:45
ASTRID CYNTHIA And I really, I, I like my few clients which I have so far. I like them, the, the smile on their face, after one hour before. So this makes me, oh, yeah, I want to help the next client but I have to wait for two, two weeks for, for next… 

00:19:00
ROBERT DILTS So now, yeah okay. But so I want to have to wait, but I really want to do this, I want to get out there, I want to see more smiles on the faces of my clients… 

00:19:05
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:19:05
ROBERT DILTS Yes, is this true? 

00:19:10
ASTRID CYNTHIA I want to, I want to help. 

00:19:10
ROBERT DILTS I want to help. 

00:19:10
ASTRID CYNTHIA I want to support. 

00:19:10
ROBERT DILTS And I want to use my skills. 

00:19:15
ASTRID CYNTHIA And it loves me too, so… 

00:19:15
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:19:15
ASTRID CYNTHIA It's, it's really, it's a wonderful world. 

00:19:15
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:19:20
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah, it's a wonderful world. 

00:19:20
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, fantastic Yes, but, now we're going to take two steps to the other side, but there is this other side and let's just take a moment and give. So, really, let's really acknowledge this side, because there is a contrary to that, right, there's something else that's also true for me which is, what would, what would this be. 

00:19:50
[sil.] 

00:20:00
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, really take your time really, honor that there is something very, very important here. 

00:20:05
[sil.] 

00:20:10
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah. Umm… I know there's, there was a specific situation in my, I just, it just popped out in my mind so. 

00:20:15
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:20:20
ASTRID CYNTHIA Umm… It's almost some kind of that I am, I am, I am helpless so, I don't know. 

00:20:25
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, so just, let's take a moment and so there's something for such a specific situation pops up and there's a feeling of helplessness. 

00:20:35
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:20:35
ROBERT DILTS And what is this, what was that, what would be the truth here for you, what is this about. 

00:20:40
ASTRID CYNTHIA The truth is that, that it wasn't my fault but uh… 

00:20:50
ROBERT DILTS But there's some, there's afraid of something here. 

00:20:55
[sil.] 

00:21:00
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah. I umm… the feeling of being lost, I don't know, so that was very, it was a bad experience. 

00:21:05
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:21:10
ASTRID CYNTHIA Umm… I failed, I failed and umm…oops, oops yeah. 

00:21:20
ROBERT DILTS Something about being helpless, I failed. 

00:21:20
ASTRID CYNTHIA And I didn't, I, I wasn't able to, to solve it by myself so. 

00:21:25
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:21:30
ASTRID CYNTHIA Umm… but I was, I really didn't have the, the condition to help, help myself so umm… It was, yeah. 

00:21:40
ROBERT DILTS So what is it that you would say is the thing that's happening here, is it I'm, I'm afraid I will fail again and I feel, I feel helpless and I'm afraid I'm going to fail. What would be that. 

00:21:55
ASTRID CYNTHIA Umm… 

00:21:55
ROBERT DILTS What would be the truth of this place for you? And we can see again there's clearly a very different sort of a gesture, with so this has just as much emotional and sematic reality. 

00:22:10
ASTRID CYNTHIA That the truth is that, that in this, what I really, don't like the world, I don't world. 

00:22:20
ROBERT DILTS Ah… that's very interesting because you said the world is great I don't like the world, and why don't you like the world what is it about it that it's not likable, is it dangerous? 

00:22:30
[sil.] 

00:22:35
ASTRID CYNTHIA Umm… It's a thing of umm… justice that umm… 

00:22:35
ROBERT DILTS It's unjust? 

00:22:40
ASTRID CYNTHIA Mm-hm. 

00:22:40
ROBERT DILTS So, so the world is unjust. Is that what it might be? 

00:22:45
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah, it could be so cruel. 

00:22:45
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:22:50
ASTRID CYNTHIA Leaving yeah, I rather than alone so they're… I tell you all, I'm alone, so it could be cruel too, so… 

00:22:55
ROBERT DILTS I'm alone, the world is outside, the world is cruel, this is another truth which is very interesting because as, as the great physicist Niels Bohr said, if in a shallow truth the opposite is false, in a deep truth the opposite is also true meaning, the world is great the world is cruel. Both are true and it's sometimes very powerful to really experience that. So let's, let's really touch this for a moment and honor this truth. I am alone, the world can be cruel, I can fail. 

00:23:35
ASTRID CYNTHIA Mm-hm. 

00:23:35
ROBERT DILTS And that's true. I mean that is, that is something that you experienced, huh. 

00:23:45
[sil.] 

00:23:50
ROBERT DILTS But we know that there's another truth, so let's take two steps to the other side for a moment again, because actually the world is also great and I'm ready. 

00:24:00
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:24:00
ROBERT DILTS I'm ready, right, I've been taking all these courses, I'm ready to go. 

00:24:05
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah, I'm really ready to go. 

00:24:10
ROBERT DILTS I can make people smile, I can, I can see that smile, so a really come back to the truth of this, this is all, this is true, this is also true. 

00:24:20
ASTRID CYNTHIA Mm-hm. 

00:24:20
ROBERT DILTS The world is great, there's all this opportunity out there, to take your time to really connect in to this truth as well, and I'm sure that you also have memories. And you have to see those clowns. They are not fake, right. That really does happen. 

00:24:40
[sil.] 

00:24:45
ROBERT DILTS Can you touch this truth? I am ready, it's time to start, I want to put my skills into practice. Is that true? 

00:25:00
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:25:00
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:25:00
ASTRID CYNTHIA I know… 

00:25:05
ROBERT DILTS Yup. That you see how's that? We got time for that over there we want to, kind of see, we want to… 

00:25:10
ASTRID CYNTHIA That was interesting, I, I wanted to, to talk about this other part of me. 

00:25:15
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:25:15
ASTRID CYNTHIA This part. 

00:25:20
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. Let's start, for this part, let's start here. Let's go, okay, come back to this. 

00:25:20
ASTRID CYNTHIA So, mm-hm. 

00:25:25
ROBERT DILTS And say again, you are ready, are you not? 

00:25:25
ASTRID CYNTHIA I am, I am ready. I am, I am ready. 

00:25:30
ROBERT DILTS I am ready. By the way, you've probably you noticed us a little bit, there was a little bit of this but that's because we're still, and this is actually the first step of this process, we want to sort of really get that too oriented so that they are not kind of contaminating each other. Because they contaminate each other I'm not congruent either way. And so, I just keep pulling the rug out, so just take a moment and really kind of reconnect to that fact that, I, I, I am, I do want to put my skills to work, right. There is a lot about the world, I love the world. 

00:26:05
ASTRID CYNTHIA I love the world. 

00:26:05
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:26:05
ASTRID CYNTHIA Umm… and I really wanna show this… 

00:26:05
ROBERT DILTS And I wanna show that I love the world. 

00:26:10
ASTRID CYNTHIA …to, to my clients. 

00:26:10
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:26:15
ASTRID CYNTHIA And to, to all the people who are interested and so, yeah. 

00:26:15
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, and that's true, yes. 

00:26:20
ASTRID CYNTHIA Mm-hm. 

00:26:20
ROBERT DILTS But, now we're gonna come over here, but we also know that I have had this situations for I felt helpless and failed. 

00:26:35
ASTRID CYNTHIA Mm-hm. 

00:26:35
ROBERT DILTS Hope that I failed even though I couldn't really do anything about it, the world can be cruel and I can be alone. And that's true. 

00:26:45
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:26:45
ROBERT DILTS We see a little bit more of that coming here though, so we, this is sort of this side. Let's get the, if you relax, yeah, just sort of there, yeah, do we connect with this. And I want to really invite you now as you connect with us, we're going to take a second step now as we begin to get them organized here, So Astrid as you really feel the truth of this, what is the positive intention of this, what is this, this all the sense of why the world is cruel, uh… I am alone what is this trying to do for you, what is the positive purpose of this. 

00:27:25
ASTRID CYNTHIA You have to do it by your own. 

00:27:30
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. And, and what does that mean, I mean what is the intention of that if you, if you have to do it on your own. 

00:27:35
ASTRID CYNTHIA That I'm capable to do. 

00:27:35
ROBERT DILTS That's very interesting. So that I'm capable, actually part of the intention of this is that I am actually capable to do it on my own. And that's important to know. I am capable, and the positive intention here is to, to watch out for myself, yeah. 

00:27:55
ASTRID CYNTHIA To watch out for myself and to, to care for my leg. 

00:28:00
ROBERT DILTS To care for your leg. 

00:28:00
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:28:05
ROBERT DILTS That's really letting you know, right, that leg is really letting you know listen to me, listen to me. And we honor that truth, you do have to watch out for yourself. 

00:28:15
ASTRID CYNTHIA Mm-hm. 

00:28:20
ROBERT DILTS But, but over here, we can go and… I'm ready to go. 

00:28:30
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yes. 

00:28:30
ROBERT DILTS World is good, I can show, I'm ready to show and I can, I can … 

00:28:35
ASTRID CYNTHIA I can tell you something. 

00:28:35
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:28:40
ASTRID CYNTHIA I can teach you something. 

00:28:40
ROBERT DILTS I can teach you something. 

00:28:40
ASTRID CYNTHIA If you want to know something about yoga I can teach you. 

00:28:40
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:28:45
ASTRID CYNTHIA Or I don't know, yeah, I have something to tell. 

00:28:45
ROBERT DILTS I have something to say, right. I have something to teach. And I'm curious what is the positive intention of this, what is this about, if that's about watch out for yourself what is this about. 

00:29:00
ASTRID CYNTHIA You can even do more. 

00:29:05
ROBERT DILTS Ah… 

00:29:05
ASTRID CYNTHIA You can even do more, you can believe in yourself. 

00:29:10
ROBERT DILTS Oh! 

00:29:15
ASTRID CYNTHIA You are the most important person to believe in yourself. 

00:29:15
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, that's interesting. 

00:29:20
ASTRID CYNTHIA I believe in myself. 

00:29:20
ROBERT DILTS Wow. 

00:29:25
ASTRID CYNTHIA Umm… the world is mine. 

00:29:25
ROBERT DILTS The world is mine, that's nice 

00:29:30
ASTRID CYNTHIA I, I, yeah. I can do it so, it seems a bit silly, I mean to say, I can…you can do it, so I, I can do it. 

00:29:40
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, I can do it. 

00:29:40
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:29:40
ROBERT DILTS Great. Now, instead of going all the way back over, what we're going to do next is, let's come first to the middle just right between the two for just a moment. And first without going to either of them. One of our principles as we say I want to sort to be able to be with both of them without becoming either for just a moment. So there's one side, over here and I, I can know that it's there without getting lost in it. There's one on the other side, I can know that's there and now we're going to do a kind of an interesting thing from this place of sort of being in between, if you took a step back Astrid. A step back far enough that you could actually sort of hold both at the same time without being for the moment one or the other, and this is going to be that place for we want to do the thought experiment, actually both are true. The world is both, you know, it can be cruel and the world is great. I have to watch out for myself and I can do it, I can do even more. But I can, I am helpless, alone and I am, I can believe in myself, that actually both are true. 

00:30:55
ASTRID CYNTHIA Mm-hm. 

00:30:55
ROBERT DILTS Both are true of Astrid. 

00:31:00
ASTRID CYNTHIA I think it's such a sad story, so that, it was so long umm… I had, I had this two parts. 

00:31:10
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:31:15
ASTRID CYNTHIA Who didn't know about each other, so they were separated. 

00:31:15
ROBERT DILTS And that's very interesting isn't it. 

00:31:20
ASTRID CYNTHIA This is umm… 

00:31:20
ROBERT DILTS They didn't know about each other. 

00:31:25
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah, they didn't know. 

00:31:25
ROBERT DILTS And that's the interesting thing about this kind of, this kind of ego states. It's like our own, it's kind of like our own little sense of a kind of multiple personality, right. I don't even know about them, why because when I get in this state, that sort of is disappeared. So let's just take a moment and if you could hold them both and realize both are true and much more than that. This is also not the totality of Astrid. 

00:31:55
[sil.] 

00:32:00
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah. I like both of them. 

00:32:00
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, well, that's interesting. They both have a positive intention, right, to take care of me especially my leg over here, but also to know I can believe in me I can do more. 

00:32:15
ASTRID CYNTHIA Mm-hm. 

00:32:20
ROBERT DILTS And I'm even more than that, I'm actually much more than that. 

00:32:25
[sil.] 

00:32:30
ROBERT DILTS That's a kind of a very interesting sort of spontaneous gesture anyway, the book. Now, Astrid, if you would be willing I am, I think, you've been in another very fascinating place to explore here which is the sort of the fourth place. Where I think this when I say there's more, let's find out, let's come back to the middle now. We need a little space in front, but we're not gonna go all the way over there. But, So now it is kind of you have that sense on the one side is the sense of, you know well, I want to stay in my comfort zone, I need to care for myself, the world can be cruel, I can be alone. On the other side I, I am capable, I can do what I believe in myself, there's so much more to give, I can, I have something to share, I have something to say. Again, we both are true and, and maybe for one of the first times they can actually get to know each other. Now the fourth filled far experiment here will be, wouldn't be interesting if we could enter into a frame, where we go actually the map is not the territory. And what if it was neither true that the world was uh… you know, dangerous and I was alone nor that, you know, I was completely believed in my self, I actually, it's, it's not that I don't, it's just that neither is fully true. It's a very interesting thing, there, that there's both are a map, neither is the territory. And that becomes a very interesting place to explore. Dr. Erickson used to take his patients to what he called the middle of nowhere. And in the middle of nowhere anything was possible, right. You're sort of outside of the box, so it's kind of an interesting… 

00:34:20
ASTRID CYNTHIA Can we go there? 

00:34:20
ROBERT DILTS Can we go there! let's go there together. Sounds like you are ready. 

00:34:20
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:34:25
ROBERT DILTS And so actually and there can even be like a little gesture where, where this when you were doing this, this one could kind of be just for the moment, I can sort of step out of that and find out what else is there, why this notion be curious, what's possible. So when you're ready you just kind of step forward and you go, I'm going to sort of go for a moment neither and you can either go, or. It's neither cruel, nor is it wonderful. It's neither have to take care of myself, nor do I have the, that, I can just enter in this place. A kind of an open space in, as we can even see already that looks like a very interesting inner experience. 

00:35:10
ASTRID CYNTHIA Mm-hm. 

00:35:10
ROBERT DILTS Anything you can share with us about what's going on. 

00:35:15
[sil.] 

00:35:20
ASTRID CYNTHIA Umm… It's like feeling, I feel like completed but I can't say what it was. 

00:35:25
ROBERT DILTS That's interesting. 

00:35:30
ASTRID CYNTHIA Completed and so, here I am really ready to start. 

00:35:35
ROBERT DILTS A lot times that people say I'm just me, because I'm, it's not this or that like from those… it's not like the sub personality, it's just, boom like as I am completed. 

00:35:45
ASTRID CYNTHIA Uh… and I want to start from here. 

00:35:50
ROBERT DILTS Start from here, that's a good place to start from. 

00:35:50
ASTRID CYNTHIA This feeling completed. 

00:35:50
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:35:55
ASTRID CYNTHIA And uh… with still a question mark umm… if there's something more to explore, some other parts I don't even know yet. 

00:36:05
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:36:05
ASTRID CYNTHIA But there, there will be a spot for them. So, this, this makes it completed, even if there's something if I am curious about, may be there is, there are some more, some more about me and some… 

00:36:15
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:36:15
ASTRID CYNTHIA And there will be space. 

00:36:20
ROBERT DILTS There's, might be there's some more about me, that I don't even know yet. 

00:36:25
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:36:25
ROBERT DILTS That's an interesting place to be. 

00:36:25
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:36:25
ROBERT DILTS It looks like it's actually fairly nice place to be. 

00:36:30
ASTRID CYNTHIA yeah, it's, it's like a, yeah it's like a, it's like a very calm state, it's umm… like I am, like I am looking into a Buddha face. 

00:36:45
ROBERT DILTS By the way you see, look there's a different gesture, then, then, that, that. 

00:36:50
ASTRID CYNTHIA I am really so devoted to myself. 

00:36:55
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:36:55
ASTRID CYNTHIA That, that I am wonderful. So, umm… this… 

00:37:05
ROBERT DILTS So there is a whole lot of nicest space here. So now, here's where we, where we actually complete the process itself, which is we complete the process and as you said you get started. We are actually going to step back to the middle. Where now you've got all four one side, because one of the basic principles in the notion of NLP is we say, you never want to, you never want to weird choice, you are always adding a choice. When you actually have it as a choice, one of the sort of presuppositions is that we will take the best choice. The unconscious, the, the conscious mind does not always know that you are unconscious if I can hold the choices, we'll take what is the best choice and I don't have to force myself, I don't have to struggle with it. So if I can go whether, so this is still a choice and obviously there is a positive intention for care for myself. This is also a choice, I have got a lot to say, I've got something to give, I have done all these workshops. Both are true and in a certain way neither is the full truth of me. There is much more than that. I can be curious to discover what's possible, so all four at the same time. 

00:38:20
[sil.] 

00:38:30
ASTRID CYNTHIA It feels good. 

00:38:30
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, it is very interesting breath that we all saw that, that kind of. 

00:38:40
ASTRID CYNTHIA That umm… this, no pressure to be either or the other. 

00:38:45
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, this actually very interesting that you find when there is no pressure in my example of, in my example of the woman who wanted to quit smoking like when there was no pressure, then it's actually just in this moment what is true for me, what do I really want to do. 

00:39:00
ASTRID CYNTHIA And I like to have that is a choice. 

00:39:00
ROBERT DILTS That it's a choice. 

00:39:00
ASTRID CYNTHIA My choice. 

00:39:05
ROBERT DILTS It's my choice. Yeah. 

00:39:05
ASTRID CYNTHIA Mm-hm. 

00:39:05
ROBERT DILTS One of the things that we like to say in, in NLP is that when we are no longer just are programming, right, so I'm not this program, that program, I actually have the possibility of choice, and who chooses it's not this it's not that, it's actually a deeper sense of myself. 

00:39:25
ASTRID CYNTHIA Mm-hm. 

00:39:30
ROBERT DILTS That looks like it is. 

00:39:30
ASTRID CYNTHIA Yeah, yeah. So how, how could you do this. 

00:39:35
ROBERT DILTS So. 

00:39:35
ASTRID CYNTHIA Thank you so much, thank you so much. Thank you. 

00:39:40
[sil.] 

00:39:45
ROBERT DILTS You are welcome, your pleasure. Thank you. So, so, thank you Astrid very beautiful. So now I have to say there was two people that wanted to be our demonstrations and I said, well if we get through the first one quickly enough, it might be interesting for you guys to see a second one with a kind of different content. And so, and just we can walk through it a little bit more quickly and I think that in some ways kind of also gives you a, a sense of how might we do this. So if you are we have our second demo subject and we'll just, we'll just kind of walk through the same steps, but will see that with different content, things also sharpen slightly different ways. I find that this is a very gentle uh… way to sort of get to a place of actually greater wholeness in ourselves. So as we do it again, it will kind of take it as a sort of review, what, what are the, and I'll kind of go over the steps a little bit more explicitly umm… because it is something that you can umm… I, I find it, it's, it's one of the probably one of the most umm… it's one of the things that I use most commonly, most frequently when I am coaching people or doing some kind of therapeutic work, because we're constantly getting, getting stuck in these struggles. Uh… so yes, yes yeah. 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:25
ROBERT DILTS That's, that's a good point. It, the, the comment is, and this is interesting from this in traditional sort of uh… NLP conflict integration, you would get these two parts, get their intention and look for common intention. And then try to get an integration, actually what, but the big challenge with that is you're still inside of this box, it's almost like you're taking black and white and making a gray or something. And what actually becomes rather interesting and, and that's why I really acknowledge that, that is a, that is definitely a process that you can do, but it actually is rather interesting to hold all the four points simultaneously. In the generative coaching work we actually find that it's much more generative, that is that I'm holding the space between and you actually oftentimes get that, you know, in this third position you, you will spontaneously get that as we saw this kind of thing. But there's actually more that can be done. So, would, if you would please join us let's walk through a second example. Yes. 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN What does the word Lemma mean? 

00:42:30
ROBERT DILTS Lemma means point, I was saying Lemma means like a point. So di lemma, two point, tetra lemma, four points. So, let's again start in the middle and so let's just sort of walk through and, and again, I mean NLP is a lot about process and I've been saying that one of the things that I learned most from Erickson is that, things are not all bunch of techniques. So this for me, this is a great process but I, I don't necessarily consider it as just, you know, that it's a technique. Umm… so I think it is also important to leave a lot of space open for, for both the individuality and creativity to emerge here. But it's a very, I find it a very nice structure for, for allowing a lot of flexibility. So we, always a starting point is we just take a few seconds to come to what I was calling the coach state, centered, open, alert, aware, connected inwardly head, heart, belly, feet, so a sense of an inner wholeness. I am whole and I am also part of something bigger than myself, I am part of the family, culture, community, that sort of sense of connection and then readiness to create a space to hold a space. 

00:43:55
[sil.] 

00:44:00
ROBERT DILTS And when we're ready we just acknowledge, you know, I'm here, I'm ready. 

00:44:05
UNKNOWN I am here, I am ready. 

00:44:05
ROBERT DILTS I see you, I see, are you, are you on actually. 

00:44:10
UNKNOWN I may not have. 

00:44:10
ROBERT DILTS There now. 

00:44:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:44:15
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, now your voice can be heard, so say a little bit about where, where again we'll start with the content and that helps us to sort out the, the points of the Dilemma. So what is the sort of dilemma that you find yourself in. 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN Umm… so I have reached a stage in my life, where I thought I could do whatever I wanted. 

00:44:35
ROBERT DILTS Yes. 

00:44:35
UNKNOWN And some, umm… you know, my daughter has been diagnosed with a serious chronic illness. 

00:44:45
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. Just take a moment to allow that to be present here. She said, well she is, she said, "I thought I had reached a point in my life where I could, you know, do whatever I want, then I recently got the news that my daughter has a serious chronic illness," and that's what sort of is taking a moment to sort of honor the emotional… 

00:45:10
UNKNOWN And so, I wanted to help her obviously, umm… 

00:45:15
ROBERT DILTS Yes. 

00:45:15
UNKNOWN But also I raised eight children. 

00:45:15
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:45:20
UNKNOWN And, you know, and, and then I did chat therapy for 25 years. And umm… umm… hope a way, you know, done therapy longer than that, but the kids were 25 years. Umm… 

00:45:35
[sil.] 

00:45:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, so I, I think I, I just have… 

00:45:40
ROBERT DILTS By the way, if you hear that, kind of that, you hear right in the middle of that dilemma it's a, right, there's, there's not even you can almost hear the voice almost disappears. But I think we have something where we go on the one hand you're saying it's time for myself. 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:45:55
ROBERT DILTS Raised eight children, I have done, you know, I've, I've worked and it's, it's time for me to in the sense enjoy my life to live my life. Is that what it would be something like that. 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:46:05
ROBERT DILTS How would you, what would you use for that? 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN Uh… 

00:46:10
ROBERT DILTS And, and I see is it more which side would you put that on, is it on the left or the right, that's really time for me. 

00:46:15
UNKNOWN Umm… well, I, I think. 

00:46:20
ROBERT DILTS Let's go here, yeah. And new even see those… 

00:46:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:46:20
ROBERT DILTS Now you noticed, now instead of being in the dilemma and, and that learning went to many years ago talked about the importance of sorting the two things, so again you're not just caught in the struggle, so here we go. 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:46:40
ROBERT DILTS What would be this truth is its time. 

00:46:40
UNKNOWN I can be, I can follow my own rhythm. 

00:46:45
ROBERT DILTS Beautiful, beautiful. 

00:46:45
UNKNOWN I can follow my own breath and I can be true to myself, I can be free, but I mostly follow my own rhythm. 

00:46:50
ROBERT DILTS Excellent means so here you get that's, that's a very powerful simple statement of the truth of this, I can follow my own rhythm, I want to do that, it's time. But, and now let's take two steps to the other side. But there again with this, this report about the, the discovery about the illness of your daughter, but there is something else. There's another truth. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN So many responsibilities. 

00:47:15
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN There's no time for me. 

00:47:20
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. I have responsibilities, and let's honor that. We consider that again… 

00:47:30
UNKNOWN And I want to do it, it's just so time consuming. 

00:47:30
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. I want to, I really want to be available for my daughter. But it's, it takes away, you know, it's, it's responsibilities, I have these big responsibilities. Really take the time to be with the truth of that. And this also of course as we know has a positive intention, I want, I want to be, I want to help. And what is the truth of that positive intention? 

00:48:05
UNKNOWN I love her, I want to be available and I also need to work and I also have a husband and a life and, and umm… I feel like they are into an hours in a day. 

00:48:20
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:48:20
UNKNOWN But though I did come here. 

00:48:25
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, yeah. But I, but there is a truth here. I do have, I have a lot of responsibilities that I take on, I willingly take on but it means there's no time for me. 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:48:35
ROBERT DILTS But, let's take two steps to the other side. But, and let's really get that gesture here. That I want to get my own rhythm I can be at my own rhythm, I've earned it, right. I've earned that is, it's time for me to live my life at my rhythm. 

00:48:55
UNKNOWN I feel so good. When I can just follow my own rhythm, you know, sleep when I wanna sleep, eat when I wanna eat, you know, whatever. 

00:49:00
ROBERT DILTS Right. 

00:49:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:49:05
ROBERT DILTS And what is the positive intention of this, what is that it's… 

00:49:05
UNKNOWN Self care. 

00:49:05
ROBERT DILTS Self care. 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:49:10
ROBERT DILTS So by the way in our study it's self care, care for others, those are both going to be very important parts of, of who you are. But one thing is myself care is, is important. 

00:49:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:49:25
ROBERT DILTS And my rhythm is important. 

00:49:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:49:30
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. But, let's take a trip to the other side for the moment, let's also honor this, there's another truth here. Now by the way you'll notice as we go, and the reason I like to go back and forth physically few times is you'll start to see that the part of the, what we call the crash part, you know, begins to loosen a little bit. As you really give space to what this is about, but I do care for others. I do have responsibilities and I want to. 

00:49:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:49:55
ROBERT DILTS I want to do that. 

00:49:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:50:00
ROBERT DILTS And, and what would you say again, you know, the positive intention here is, what is really that positive intention. 

00:50:10
UNKNOWN Well, I love and care for my family. 

00:50:10
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. That is true. I love and I care for my family. And I want to take on responsibilities. 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:50:20
ROBERT DILTS But, let's take the trip back over, I love living at my own rhythm and I earned it. 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:50:30
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. That is also true. 

00:50:30
UNKNOWN Yeah it's also true, yeah. 

00:50:30
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN Space for me. 

00:50:35
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, space for me. Now, uh… let's take a step to the middle here. And for just a moment, so before remember when we stood here it was kind of this uh… But now, if I can just open this place where on the one side space for me, self care, go wit my rhythm. On the other side, love and care for my family. Uh… I have a lot of responsibilities, all right, I want to take those responsibilities. Both are true, and for a moment then let's take a step back far and this is important, for sort of far enough from either one, even a little bit farther, so that you can sort of hold both truths at the same time without, now without them instead of being uh… I actually go both are true. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:51:35
ROBERT DILTS Myself care is, is important. My rhythm is important. I have earned the right to my own rhythm. It's also true that I love and care for others especially my family. And that I do, I, I willingly take responsibility. And it might even be interesting, yeah. 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:51:55
ROBERT DILTS That if you could even sort of hold them both. 

00:52:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. They are both a core of, a core of me. 

00:52:05
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. They are, And this is now the next part here, and I'm also much more, there's much more than just that to, it is not, that is not the total universe, right. I'm also, there's more than that, there's more space. 

00:52:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:52:25
[sil.] 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN Uh… I feel like I can breathe more here. 

00:52:30
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:52:30
ROBERT DILTS Isn't that interesting, right. This is this notion, we want to give that to all the truths their space, give them their voice and more than just a cognitive voice, right. That's why we want to use the body, so meant to get the somatic emotional reality of both. And it's really good to know both are true for me. And in a certain way and again this is where the creative unconscious can begin to come in. I don't have to sacrifice one for the other now maybe given in, in a just to, just to give a very quick little example, I was working with a man once, very successful young man. He was in his late 30s, he had achieved the level of chief executive of a major pharmaceutical company. And he said, you know, and, and company has been very successful. I was wondering, what do you want coaching for, and he said, he said very simply, "I don't go to work with a sparkle in my eye anymore. And I said well, what would put the sparkle in your eye, and he said, "all this that's crazy." It was crazy. I said well I come from California, you know, I do this thing called NLP, you probably won't startle me too much. Is it? Well, I would leave all this and I would go to the desert and I would help people that couldn't help themselves. But I can't do that because I've got a wife and four kids and I have all this responsibilities. And then the interesting thing was I said, "well, let's not throw one away, let's hold them both, because at that particular moment his only map of the world was I either stay in this job, right, or I go into the desert, right. And to, to speed my soul, like one was kind of feeding my, my sense of, my successful self, and the other was my soul. What I do to get my moment, but these were the only two images of the possibilities, and this is why it becomes an interesting generative process, rather than try to just do that, if I hold both of these becomes actually a rather interesting exploration. 

00:54:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hm. 

00:54:30
ROBERT DILTS Is it really one, or the other. And this is where I think that fourth position becomes very interesting. That if it was neither that I care for me or I care for others, there could be some interesting possibility, you know, possibility of some, some structure, some ideas I haven't even thought of yet. So let's explore that place if you would be willing. 

00:54:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

00:54:55
ROBERT DILTS So we come back to the middle. On the one side there's self care of my own rhythm. On the other side, there's love and care for others and responsibility, but it takes time, so I don't, that I don't have time for me. Behind now I've got both, both are actually true. And for a moment the thought experiment would be, what if I could step into a place where it wasn't either or that I, it was like I, it was like neither have to go at my own rhythm nor I have to, you know, uh… take on so many responsibilities, just a sort of an open space. It's kind of notion that the map is not the territory, there might be a lot of territory that I haven't even explored yet, and as Dr Erickson would say, "I just become very curious what's possible," ready for that thought experiment? 

00:55:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:55:55
ROBERT DILTS So we take, it's almost like you're going to step outside of the box for a moment. When you are ready, and it's in a sense for a moment I just leave both behind. I'm not abandoning, I'm not abandoning any choice, I'm actually exploring another choice, which is just a kind of open space. 

00:56:15
[sil.] 

00:56:20
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. That's interesting. 

00:56:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, it's like uh… yeah. It's like umm… 

00:56:30
[sil.] 

00:56:35
ROBERT DILTS To me that breath speaks volumes. 

00:56:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. I feel it's like, it's like just being that my body had re adjusted just being. 

00:56:45
ROBERT DILTS Yes, yeah. That's very interesting, just being, but actually to readjust and this is why I say this notion of identity shift, it's not just cognitive, right. It's, I can't do it just verbally, I've actually got to sort of fit into a sort of new me essence. 

00:57:05
UNKNOWN It feels more relaxed. 

00:57:05
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, it looks more like you actually you got enough space for a smile there, which looks lovely, looks beautiful. So now I know we're, are in our kind of final five moments but I think that's really nice. Let's take our, let's use the last couple of minutes, take a step back to the middle and here now, we're not abandoning any choice. I think myself care is important, I do love and I care for others, and I do willingly take responsibilities, I do both and I can also just be. 

00:57:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:57:35
ROBERT DILTS I can also just be and be curious to discover what is possible. 

00:57:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

00:57:50
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, again you could see that and see that big smile that's there and it's nice to know, it's nice to know. That that is, that that's a choice that you can know how. 

00:58:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:58:00
ROBERT DILTS And this is like, Astrid was saying, "this is a nice place to start, this is a nice place to become curious," now I'm here, how do I create the, the rest of it. And this is where I'm going to, I really say that rather than have some kind of conscious cognitive solution, now I want to let my creative unconscious begin to sort of let that percolate. And then what I found with this young man I was talking, began to find was, all the sudden all these synchronicities began to happen. Things that he never thought about began to kind of pop up into his life. And suddenly, it was no longer this or that, that suddenly like he would saw something on the television, you know, boom it just came and he went, oh! That's interesting. And I have to say by the way this, this young man now has, has become the chief executive, he was he was a chief executive of the division. Now he is the chief executive of the whole company, he has brought a lot of changes into this company, so that through his own transformation it's made a lot of difference in the lives of others, So, thank you very much for sharing. 

00:59:05
UNKNOWN Uh… thank you so much. 

00:59:10
[sil.] 

00:59:20
ROBERT DILTS And, so thank you all. So, this kind of, again, for those who have had that background working with this kind of typical sort of sorting the conflict and integrating, it becomes another very interesting choice, you have the choice. But this also gives you this fourth position of, if I get completely out of that box there's a whole open space there. So may you have lots of open space the rest of the conference and thank you very much.
