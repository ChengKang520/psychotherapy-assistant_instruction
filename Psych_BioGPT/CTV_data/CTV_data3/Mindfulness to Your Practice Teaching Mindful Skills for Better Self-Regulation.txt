Mindfulness to your Practice:

Teaching Mindful Skills for Better Self-Regulation

Alexander Simpkins, PhD and Annellen Simpkins, PhD 

00:00:30
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Well I'm Annellen Simpkins. 

00:00:30
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS And I'm Alex and together we were going to introduce this very nice person through mindfulness as part of our helping her with what she'd like to work with. 

00:00:45
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So this is May, could you correct us. 

00:00:45
MAY Yes. 

00:00:45
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Would you like to tell us a little bit about what you want to work on. 

00:00:50
MAY Uh… so I'm May what I want to work on is that whenever I feel stressed out I cannot speak clearly. I can't see the words as English is my second language but when I do function very well, I feel confident on stage or impress on conversations I'm very brilliant, I'm smart and I can express that those things where I can nervous… like this. And I think it's affecting my work and personal relationship a lot. Also I'm not going to a lot of social occasions because I don't feel comfortable or competent socially. 

00:01:30
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Good well thank you very much for disclosing that and mindfulness can be a very useful and positive way to address this we think. 

00:01:40
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS It, it really is helpful and we thought we'd give a brief introduction of mindfulness you are familiar with mindfulness and many of you are but we'll just give you a brief introduction I mean we are really fortunate to uh… Kevin's in for having done the wonderful research that he did that really opened the way for all of us to bring mindfulness into our practice I mean it's now considered efficacious and there's lots of research to Breck, back it up so you can be really confident in bringing some mindfulness into your work and so Cabot's in describes mindfulness as being present in the in the present moment being aware without making any judgments so how is this different from every day conscious when you think about it when you're aware something you know you think about it you think. I like that, I don't like that that's good or that's bad or you know, that reminds me of something long ago or that makes me think of the future or you know I'm having none of that or wow I want more you know, so we're always making judgments, time traveling all over the place and deciding whether we want to accept something or reject it and these are going on and this is a wonderful aspect of awareness. I mean many great discoveries in understandings have occurred by being discerning in these ways but when you're mindful you set that aside and you simply notice things just as they are. So in practice this kind of practice is very helpful for what you're working on, because probably in that moment like what do you feel when you're in that moment let's say you're front of let's just pretend that you're in front of a lot of people you know. And you feel awkward. 

00:03:30
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS So there you are they're all there all watching you and you become conscious of yourself. 

00:03:35
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Just pretend. 

00:03:35
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS If that's okay, you know, only the amount that you're comfortable with. 

00:03:40
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS But what do you feel right now? 

00:03:45
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS because you're also with us you know not keep please keep that in mind but there you are in that situation and that feeling kind of comes over you and what's that like? 

00:03:50
MAY So origin was sitting here and I felt comfortable to some degree and I feel that the awareness or this. I'm sensing the energy I'm sensing right here about this range. But when this was being reminded that I'm in front of the group of people with so many eyes looking at me, me it feels like there's huge energy is coming through and if I study conscious tried to evoke the fear of anxiety of being in front of group people, this is what happens like I go into a state… almost like going blink. And to feel that Blink sometimes comes up with the okay oh, people thank you. 

00:04:35
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Thank you. 

00:04:40
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So judgment's in a sense and you're worried about what they're judging you, right thinking of those judgments' 

00:04:45
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS And perhaps you also begin to think of yourself as how you're being seen as sort of projecting out to them I imagined feeling about you from them. And then that makes you conscious and then you have two things you're thinking of what you're what you're thinking about and then what you think they may be thinking and so that's right. That makes sense, umm… so, thank you for conjuring that up sort of free for us so here you are and that's beginning to happen so how do you experience that in terms of your breathing and, and, and your presence sort of there as well. 

00:05:25
MAY So I noticed my heart beat raced. I think a bit and I think my breathing becomes slightly short a bit my place becomes study but. I was speaking I also noticed my body to can't taking a deep breath may be I just unconsciousness… 

00:05:40
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS That's great. 

00:05:40
MAY Like those process was running up and becoming shallow… 

00:05:45
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS And down again yeah, so you notice that in after applying this mindfulness is she's feeling there within the practice on the one hand there is the beginning of experiencing oneself and on the other hand there is the inclusion of us in that experience that she had and so she feels herself shifting a little bit back and forth and the two begin to interrelate and that's got a lot to do with what mindfulness is about is, is it's a, it's a unifying gradually that happens where you meld things together a little bit and then the one can affect the other and when you're working on yourself as you are that can be a very positive thing as long as it's a positive influence that you're melding with as well so that's wonderful, well thank you for including us umm… so there is that feeling if we could go back to that now and, and you're beginning to have these, these experiences as you breathe a little bit and that slight awkward kind of feeling and everything. 

00:06:55
MAY Almost feel like there's an urge inside coming up and I feel like throwing up 

00:07:00
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yeah , yeah so it affects you know that area and that that makes a lot of sense and that connects you know, and you felt it in your heart beat and you felt it in that because there is nerves that run through your body especially the Vegas nerve that interconnects these areas so logically and correctly your body is signaling hey, something's going on and I want to make sense of it and so the different parts of your body begin to resonate with that and they're signaling you that this is going on and it's a little awkward but you're also like a compass finding the direction you know you're also beginning to find your way with the right instinctively it feels that you're happening there. 

00:07:40
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS so as you stay centered in the present moment, follow that, follow that experience, what, how does it change because it's not one Thing you know, it changes as you follow. 

00:07:50
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS And, and part of this whole process that we're, we're talking about with mindfulness is acceptance you know, and, and that's a difference between when you want something kind of overwhelms you. It doesn't, it's not something that one can accept because it's so overwhelming and you just have to cope with it but here in this situation even though you have these viewers and you know and you're giving something to posterity by doing this you know that others will learn from also. Umm… There is this there is this ability then to kind of bring it all together and, and really make for good blending you can use. 

00:08:30
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So as you stay with us. 

00:08:30
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS So if you could accept it. 

00:08:30
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS May be Close Your Eyes. 

00:08:35
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Allow yourself to. 

00:08:35
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Sense it as it goes but accept it as it is. 

00:08:35
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS And please trust us you know, we want, we want push in any way that isn't comfortable for you. And how do you feel now as you do? 

00:08:50
MAY I feel a coziness around and yet I can also feel ungrounded as if originally sitting from Lee but then root was being pulled up, so there's also a tightening up here. 

00:09:05
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS That's very good you're really / she's you're very descriptive it gives a very good sense of how you feel, wonderful. And please accept that and you know, know that that's good because then you can learn how to find your way around with that and make that you make that better. 

00:09:20
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Because acceptance when you accept it and I'm comfortable feeling it's not giving into it not saying oh, I can't do anything about it it's really getting to know it and getting to know it and getting to know just all those qualities like you felt that in your legs and coming up your body so can you accept each experience moment to moment. 

00:09:45
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS To get to get very sort of ground as you said grounded and allow that to sort of spread through you that you have as a potential there evolving. That's nice. 

00:09:55
MAY Right now I noticed that the coziness and that sense of contraction start to melt into each other. 

00:10:05
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Wonderful. 

00:10:05
MAY And I also notice that the original groundedness actually comes from an effort to some degree of effort to the right now they play into each other. That the need for the efforts to be grounded. 

00:10:15
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yes. 

00:10:15
MAY No longer exists. 

00:10:20
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS And that's, that's wonderful because that's, that's your potential May that you're letting evolve kind of like kind of like a great chef putting together a wonderful meal. Well you know that that it begins to melt together because you have that potential to be at ease and to as you accept yourself it all begins to make sense and tune and you're more tuned in and, and, and probably then as a result you can reach in deeper into your experiencing in your even more expressive because this is this is very articulate about how you're experiencing. And just please allow yourself to breathe as you are naturally that's perfectly all right. And be. 

00:11:05
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS And let those feelings emerge because we have a flow of experiencing some a sort of more in the foreground front of your mind and little flickers in the back of your mind all in the mind for a moment of now. 

00:11:20
[sil.] 

00:11:25
MAY For a brief moment I was worry about sitting here quietly and wondering how people will be looking at me. 

00:11:35
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yes. And then as you notice that. 

00:11:40
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS And then do you have a feeling with that what was the emotion, I see emotion in your face. 

00:11:45
MAY Yes, umm… sad. 

00:11:45
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Sadness. 

00:11:50
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS That's okay if you know, if you're okay with you know, without them we would love to learn a little more about that if you would, if you could all of your flying it's okay to explore it and it is important. 

00:12:05
MAY I connect to an image that I'd been seeing for many, many years, as they told girl can't hiding in the dark corner and looking out and seeing that people playing outside their kids going outside there's some lights and I always wonder could I also go out play with them and that's where the sense resides. 

00:12:25
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS It's a very, very vivid picture and. 

00:12:30
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So feel that accept that emotion that's you that's its a wonderful part and then in the emotion you find the seeds of your potential. Beautiful, sadness that feeling and that you 

00:12:40
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS And that genuine, innocent child there are that's, that's very much your inner you as well as the adult material you that you are as well. You're all of that. And what does that little child what would she you know if you could go back to that experience for a moment is that okay. As long as you're comfortable. 

00:13:05
MAY Present a moment looking back now you are hearing now little child. 

00:13:10
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS So how is she how is she experiencing herself and those others is, is there a good reason that she has to feel that she might not be accepted and, and sung by them or is that is it more of a concern that she has not knowing for sure. 

00:13:30
MAY I think it's the express of coming from poor family and sometimes when I go to other families they would judge me for coming from a poor family and I see by the bag I show up there. 

00:13:40
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS So there is the sort of source of some of the, that's wonderful you know to you notice how nicely and smoothly have reclaimed that and as long as you're okay with them. 

00:13:55
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS And can you accept that of course a young child not knowing it could feel such a feeling but here you are now you are the woman, competent, beautiful doing well all of you this is all of you makes you deeper more compassionate. 

00:14:15
[sil.] 

00:14:20
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS And what are you feeling now as you stay in the moment, the moment experiencing. 

00:14:25
MAY I feel grounded, it's a different kind being grounded than the feeling I had initially. 

00:14:35
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS And it's wonderful. 

00:14:35
MAY It's a grounding through my spine. 

00:14:40
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS You look very centered. 

00:14:40
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS You do, you look very poised and graceful and you noticed that, it's very nice the way she works. 

00:14:50
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Take a breath stay with the breath. 

00:14:50
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Please be please be you. 

00:14:55
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Without, another breath present. And feel your presence here and now. 

00:15:05
[sil.] 

00:15:25
MAY I feel Grounded and did that they don't tell stories so narratives that pops up here and there and there's a sense of its okay you saw just narratives. 

00:15:35
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS And accepting that it's okay and here you are you are you in this present moment fully yourself. 

00:15:45
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Graceful and with all that you are and with all that you become and are and are moving towards in the future where you'll be you'll be even more and yet you know all that you are begins that we all have a beginning and we all have a development of our lives and, and that's, that's very nice you can bring that to us now so that you can move here you're sharing that. 

00:16:15
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Now could you when you're ready open your eyes oh, God how do you feel. 

00:16:20
MAY Comfortable and I know this myself not being able to find words easily but it's more like I'm in the trance state rather than. 

00:16:25
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yes. 

00:16:30
MAY And to my stressed out. 

00:16:35
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS But it means a different thing you know, and so you know as you search for words umm… so you actually have choices from different languages don't you in how you depict and how you think you know which is a wonderful thing to have that option it's like different ways to perceive that in one language there might be a word for something that you have to kind of walk around to express in another so sometimes there is when there is a when there is that lacking in another language it takes a moment to just pause and consider how do I how to express it in that other way you know is that am I correct in that it's that little bit of that inner experience and feeling. 

00:17:20
MAY Fascinating, I never think of it as a good thing to. 

00:17:25
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yeah, 

00:17:25
MAY Speak two or three different languages and never feel fully grounding one. Even that way right now if I speak Mandarin to my telling these friends or families the way I talk the grammar I use it doesn't make sense to them. 

00:17:40
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yeah now that you've been you've been in America so long May. 

00:17:40
MAY Yes. 

00:17:40
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS You're not too sure. 

00:17:45
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS But actually you have a richer sense of experiencing that you can draw from… 

00:17:50
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS And actually probably they, they enjoy having an extension of their own dialect a little bit of what you've learned you know it first I don't quite know how to interpret the then they probably think Wow It's interesting you know another way to another different intonation how interesting because you offer a world of new experiences that you have lived in that you are living and it broadens the world by how you are. 

00:18:15
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Oh, wonderful, good, well, thank you May. 

00:18:20
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS With there anything else said you know. That would be useful to word we, we're comfortable with how you are but you know how really like you know. 

00:18:30
MAY Can we do a quick text what's the anxiety or stress. 

00:18:35
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yes, yes. 

00:18:35
MAY To see how my respond. 

00:18:40
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Okay we're comfortable with that and I'm happy to do that with I like the relationship we have here together and it looks like that would be good if you like to talk about that a little bit them read in a little more detail. 

00:18:50
MAY Okay, then we quick test here to see how I respond with the fact that so many eyes are looking at me. 

00:18:55
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yes please. 

00:19:00
MAY Yes I can notice the anxiety comes up but that's. 

00:19:00
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Oh good. 

00:19:05
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Can you accept it in the present moment. 

00:19:05
MAY Yes. 

00:19:05
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Part of you. 

00:19:05
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Yes, okay because there is a little difference you know it's a little more uncomfortable. 

00:19:10
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS But that even the negative feelings you know that you would call negative that's excitement right that's the kind of excitement we're here with all these wonderful people together there's energy. 

00:19:25
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS And I want to add would like to say please know that we won't push you in any way and we're happy to, to. You know if it's too uncomfortable we can know is you don't want to send us or bother us or the situation to say you know, not right now or something okay, because this is a this we us want this to be safe for you and comfortable. 

00:19:50
MAY I notice myself taking out few deep breaths but almost like. 

00:19:55
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Instinctively kind of yeah to try to catch your breath good. 

00:19:55
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS And make a mindful breath. 

00:20:00
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yeah but you know just a few because you don't want to get too much oxygen because it's a little to have too exciting. But one of the one of the definitions of anxiety that we've always like came from the pearls and it's the tension between now and later and a kind of excitement of life when you if you can sort of allow yourself to, to put in brackets any apprehension per se and just kind of be in the moment with it for a moment. 

00:20:30
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So as you take the breath we could learn a little bit more about it and around. Look at the people. Since you're experiencing here now and stay present and then the next moment day present in that accept as it is. don't judge it, Just is. 

00:20:50
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS And feel free to look at us too you know. That's quite all right. 

00:21:00
[sil.] 

00:21:05
MAY They are many different layers that Experience the past stuff some are more contracting some are kind of Scared. and yet there is so, so feeling of being okay in the background so I think I'm okay with only designing experiences cant waiting through. 

00:21:20
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Well, its very nice Yeah that's good. 

00:21:25
MAY Thank you so much. 

00:21:25

00:22:15
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Okay. 

00:22:20
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS It's not something new exactly but yet it is because it's staying in the present and in that present moment your client is always okay because they're with you and you're in that moment. You're welcome 

00:22:35
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Welcome, hello 

00:22:35
DONNA Hi, I'm Donna

UNKNOWN No. 

00:22:55
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Yes, he's saying yes okay. 

00:23:00
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Hello, well and the same question we asked her this isn't anything tremendously serious it's just okay, okay 

00:23:05
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So what would you like to work on ? 

00:23:10
[sil.] 

00:23:20
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Can we turn up the Mike a little bit is that possible?. Also you know. Do you know how to turn it on there's a little button right here and when you see it when you turn it on you'll see a little light so you know? 

00:23:30
DONNA Yes okay. 

00:23:35
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Is that better. How's that is that Is that better okay, okay You know that's, that's what I'm talking usually okay. 

00:23:50
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Well there will be times that she turns I mean I can sign but we'll do our best thank you okay I was out there okay, okay. Anyway thank you for coming and. So can you give us a little more, little more detail about that place so that and are you okay with, with the group here how do you feel first before you do that. 

00:24:15
DONNA I feel fine okay yeah. 

00:24:15
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Okay. 

00:24:20
DONNA I think this is also just learning to be in front of people and that's another thing that I'm not always very comfortable with although I've done it but I don't think too many people really feel comfortable being in front of people. 

00:24:35
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yes, so… 

00:24:35
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So if you get in touch in the present moment now just take a moment and sense what you are experiencing right here and now as you're in front of these people. Sensing that you're not that it that comfortable but okay you know, 

00:24:50
DONNA I kind of I've kind of pulled in and put my focus more on here. 

00:24:55
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Okay, go ahead. 

00:24:55
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS That's okay. 

00:25:00
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Since you're experiencing following the flow. 

00:25:00
DONNA And I feel comfortable I feel alright umm…I put my focus more on the three of us and concerning about what's going on out there it's doing what it's doing and It's my turn to do what I'm doing right here. 

00:25:20
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Good. 

00:25:20
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Okay. 

00:25:20
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So as you turn your attention in words in the in the present moment, moment to moment follow the flow of your experiencing and if you could verbalize that as you experience. 

00:25:30
[sil.] 

00:25:35
DONNA I feel a sense of umm… more comfort more coziness just bringing myself back in. 

00:25:45
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Wonderful, so, If I may ask then it's kind is it kind of like you when you large yourself to reach out with your perceptions and notice everything around you, you felt that awkwardness when you noticed the people and thought about them or… 

00:26:10
DONNA Feels a little overwhelming to think about all of the people out there, yes. 

00:26:15
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yes, but when you were here with us you were okay and yes with yourself. 

00:26:20
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS So that grounding in yourself there is that sense of okay and is here and now we are in touch with your moment to moment experiencing but when you look out is when you feel the breathing that's sure to… 

00:26:30
DONNA Yeah, the breathing gets a little shorter a little more rugged and uh… the heart starts racing a little bit more and when I bring it in it gets a lot more peaceful. 

00:26:45
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS What about midway. 

00:26:50
DONNA Umm… it feels kind it feels and Midway okay it does so with the breathing it's just a little bit more races just a little bit more but not too bad. 

00:27:05
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS So that when you reach out a little bit further and say you're in the middle there what's that like now you know where you're when you include a little more lightly… 

00:27:15
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Mindfully aware, aware of the just a little larger circle but in your own presence. 

00:27:20
DONNA It starts getting a little more comfortable as I realize that if I can go out to the first row I can go out to the second row. 

00:27:30
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Good that's a really good just really good discovery. 

00:27:35
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS I wonder if you could… 

00:27:35
DONNA And the third around. 

00:27:35
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yeah. 

00:27:40
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS And as you follow your breathing and let it stay, stay. 

00:27:45
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS But you know, stay with what you're comfortable with place and you know pull back a little bit and then step forward you know imaginatively you know on the way that's comfortable. 

00:27:55
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Because you have a resorts within right here and you sense that it was really there yes and it's always there. 

00:28:05
DONNA It's interesting that we teach it to other people but when it comes to us it's kind of like… I used to be a surgical tack and its okay to cut other people but boy when it comes time to cut that's right you don't like it so much. It becomes different. 

00:28:25
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Yeah, but that but yet you know when there are those skills are there because you have been teaching it and it's part of you and you very just very quickly centered in yourself now you're expanding can you go a little further, staying grounded in the moment not judging it just accepting it as it is. 

00:28:45
DONNA Observing it. 

00:28:50
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yeah, and sort of letting it be you know, not nice you did that very naturally and spontaneously and that's, that's what we'd like you to really get in touch with that natural capacity to spontaneously accept and then see where the limits were a little bit and then recognize, oh it's okay, so then be able to take another step and just it flows that way so you have potential with this you really do and having extended it to others. You certainly can have a dialogue with an extended towards yourself as well. 

00:29:25
DONNA It's a matter of taking it back into myself and umm… the internal dialogue of saying you've done it for other people you can do it yourself. 

00:29:35
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS So kind of like in that sense if I could ask you as if you need to sort of recognize it a little bit that it's there. 

00:29:45
DONNA It's there, yeah It hasn't gone any place. 

00:29:50
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So take a moment. 

00:29:50
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS It's wonderful. 

00:29:50
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Get very centered in your experiencing and notice as you scan through your body your emotions, your thoughts, anything flickering in the background it sort of wants to be heard or whatever is going on can you follow that. 

00:30:05
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS And I know that's not as we said today I, I want to reiterate to us that we want to push you, you know we're here for you and you to make this a good experience. 

00:30:20
DONNA I think I can feel that right here right now I'm okay. 

00:30:25
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS You certainly look at okay for sure. 

00:30:25
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS You know. 

00:30:30
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Breathe and just let that kind of feeling of okayness spread to whatever involved as it does in the next moment in the next moment. 

00:30:40
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Because that's really you know. 

00:30:45
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Maybe deep in a little maybe have more of a clear sense of it moment to moment developing. 

00:30:50
[sil.] 

00:31:00
DONNA I feel a sense of peace. That all is well. 

00:31:05
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Well and that's really natural I nicely have reclaimed that, some of that acceptance and being at ease is sort of recognizing that it really is there for you, you really have that potential and more than you even might imagine. You know, moments like that where you get a little apprehensive. 

00:31:30
DONNA Yeah I need to remember to breathe. 

00:31:35
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS I mean, part of the secret of mindfulness is remembering to do it and we get through we all data and I just want to say a wonderful time when you can practice mindfulness is when you're standing in line and nobody will know that you're doing it you're just standing there and we often have these experiences where we're in the back of the line and then we get to the front and we don't even know how we got there take those moments those free time when you have nothing else to do to be mindful or between sessions you know is another time when we as therapists you know, a lot has happened and you need that moment to bring yourself to the present moment and just remember you know to practice it you have that within you and you had it when you walked on the stage and you had it all alone but bringing it you know, just to your mind and there it is. 

00:32:25
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS So umm…would you be comfortable perhaps exploring a little what might be behind that. Even though you're sort of front of people and stuff okay. Umm… It sounded to me and listening to you like there was maybe a little bit of self-doubt you know, you're yourself as moment. 

00:32:45
DONNA Oh, yeah, oh yeah. 

00:32:50
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yeah, and so you know seeing you and seeing that you really are you have this potential to be at ease made me wonder, you know, kind of if I could understand a little better with him you could understand that better you know. 

00:33:05
DONNA I think I came from a family that didn't have a whole lot of confidence. I don't think they I think I came from generations. 

00:33:15
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Generations of not a little insecurity kind of about. About things. 

00:33:20
DONNA And I think it takes some. Sometimes to realize that I can love them but I don't have to. 

00:33:25
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Follow that… 

00:33:30
DONNA Yeah follow them. 

00:33:30
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Is there was there a history that it makes sense how they were developed that mind set kind of over. 

00:33:35
DONNA Oh yeah, my grandmother came over from Italy on the boat. She had no reason why she'd had no Idea why she was coming she came over with a half sister and was married off and umm…I think she had six or seven children and they she couldn't give them anything in terms of self-worth or because she was pretty confusing and she was a strong woman though. 

00:34:05
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yeah, very strong woman takes strength and courage to do something like. 

00:34:10
DONNA Fire she was in her own right but she came over it like about sixteen just the clothes on her back and her marriage was arranged for her. She has no say in say in… And I think my mom kind of saw that she got married at the same reason to have a roof over her head. Umm… so I think it was just sort of a message of my father you know, we live up to our relationships you know, our level of relationships. 

00:34:40
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yeah. 

00:34:45
DONNA And umm… they both of them I think had the model just you know put your head down and just plow through it kind of thing. Don't hold your head up just because troubles coming or something like that yeah. 

00:35:05
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS So, so you've coming from that kind of background and with us It was a journey that the family made them and where you are now you've kind of created a whole world you know of trying to be at ease in the world and really, really be yourself and be okay with that. 

00:35:25
DONNA Yeah, I tell my clients and I really feel strongly that we're all baking till the day we die. I tell my pineapple upside down cake and yeah, it's important to have a sense of humor about it and umm… not to blame our parents for what they didn't have because they gave the best that they did with what they had but then it's our journey to find the rest of the ingredients for our life journey. 

00:35:55
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS That's a nice metaphor. 

00:35:55
UNKNOWN So as you take the breath… 

00:35:55
UNKNOWN  when you had one how does that feel that understanding in that of grounding. 

00:36:10
DONNA A little anxious having to say it in front of everybody but it's not. 

00:36:15
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS I was concerned about that yeah that's quite of disclosure you know personal. 

00:36:20
DONNA But it's not something that I haven't shared with my own clients to get them on their own road. 

00:36:20
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yeah. 

00:36:25
DONNA As far as we do the best we can with what was. 

00:36:25
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS If you could be mindful in that moment of that experience of what, what is that feeling? 

00:36:35
DONNA Oh, for a little bit you feel the chest kind of tightening up a little bit it's time to kind of breathe. Go out in the world and look for the sugar and look at the. 

00:36:45
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS And accept that in the moment as it is without judging it either you know. And then other sensations chest. 

00:36:55
DONNA And then just noticing my breath your breath and just kind of reminding myself take a deep breath be with a breath and it's all going to be okay. 

00:37:10
[sil.] 

00:37:15
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS And in listening if, if it's okay to explore a little bit with you on that umm… one of the, one of the aspects of mindfulness and this sort of whole point of view involves compassion, compassion and compassion involves also forgiveness. Kind of a deep forgiveness where it really is let go you know you, you accept fully what spend and how others are and that's kind of like. You know when you let it you let it be going down the line and you know. 

00:37:50
DONNA That's interesting because that's one of the meditations that I do with my clients. 

00:37:55
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS I felt that. 

00:37:55
DONNA Imagine you know, that you have a rock and that you know the rock transformed into a dandelion. You know you make a wish and it's just infinite possibilities and. 

00:38:05
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS I felt that when you were talking about accidents. 

00:38:10
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So can you extend that compassion to all those ancestors who had those struggles. 

00:38:15
DONNA And I think the hardest one that's easy. 

00:38:20
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Is that? You know okay. 

00:38:20
DONNA It was a process but that's, that's a whole lot easier. Than having compassion for ourselves. 

00:38:30
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yes, that's, that's the that's the very essence within there that deep inner compassion for yourself. 

00:38:35
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Can you extend that to yourself now. 

00:38:40
DONNA I can now. 

00:38:40
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So allow that to happen for a moment. 

00:38:45
[sil.] 

00:39:15
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS That's that it's also a very vivid way you said. You know, there's an interesting conception of the soul that's part of the traditional Philosophy in Asia that not only do we have our individual souls but as a soul that we share with our ancestors and so as you, as you make your life good and you, you really evolve and you forgive yourself. Umm… The effects of your life and all that you become and all that you ,you do ripples back to the ancestors that have come before and that even though they're not in this world it affects them and affects them in effects in the hallway because they're, they're there you're part of them now which is a nice thing that is yeah it's a well yeah that's part of where the ancestor worship you know they have that tradition of doing that because honestly they feel the part that there is so much part of them there are here now and you're affecting them by your life and so these great things that you're doing in the way that you're, you're evolving actually helps them and their limitations that they may have had and trying to do the best they could you know. Yeah, Heidegger a great German philosopher wrote about how we're sort of thrown into the world and we don't choose the world you know we're just kind of thrown in there and then we find our way because we're it's inescapable where we're always being in a world of some kind you know that we have and sounds like you really you really evolving nicely and would be an honor to them you know what you become and. Probably somewhere they'd be very grateful that. To you and it gives it gives meaning that they did what they did, you know. In their and their way what they were capable of but that's good, well so. Are you okay now or how can I. 

00:41:25
DONNA I'm fine. 

00:41:25
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Good okay thank you very much. 

00:41:25
DONNA Thank you so much. 

00:41:30
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Thank you thank, you yeah, yeah. as I said we are on Facebook too if you'd like to continue to be our friend please do I mean you know, I mean that there was nicer appreciate you doing. You're welcome. And thank you for sharing that narrows very interesting nice. 

00:41:55
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So does anybody have any, any questions, comments, thoughts so I don't think we have enough time for another session, 

00:42:00
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yeah 

00:42:00
UNKNOWN Yes sir. 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN Yes, I read your. Read a few pages your book last night and I noticed that you advocated before a client would come in and use mindfulness where before they would use it on themselves should say that you recommended they check with a therapist and I always thought of mindfulness as from this is rather benign in the sense of harming you when I was just wonder if you would comment on your reasons for, for that you. 

00:42:25
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Were you talking about the Tao bipolar yes, yes when people have bipolar disorder we recommended that because often they do need medication and they you know it's good to be in conjunction with some kind of a therapist but yes mindfulness is something that you can do on your own and it's very benign as you said it's very safe and can be very helpful so that was what we had in mind specifically to help because this was a we wrote a book The Tao bipolar he's referring to and we use meditation to use along with medication in conjunction together they work great because people often think with bipolar disorder there's nothing I can do I just have to take the meds and then the meds don't totally do it for them but there's much that they can do and that's what we're addressing that but we just want to make sure that somebody picking up the book or maybe needed some you know medical care would be sure to get that too. 

00:43:20
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Often times we find in that people would like to just escape from there from their condition and just do some something that will just make it disappear you know, and not have to address it fully and what we what we want to encourage is the is really living one's life well and fully and responsibly taking, taking account of these various factors and having that sort of a positive team that you can always turn to as a resource umm… yes and often times what you do find is that with the resources in the support of friends and family and meditation you know the need for the intensity of medication diminishes somewhat but there is always a need for a regimen that you that your whole team kind of works out with you when you're bipolar to make it work because it's also not really all about living a fulfilling meaningful complete life through its development so. 

00:44:20
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:44:25
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS You're welcome. Excellent question. 

00:44:25
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Anything else. 

00:44:30
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Oh, Wow, Well, I'm glad I was very nice and we have a question here yes. 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN That was beautiful in both circumstances in the first with the first client you used senses I noticed and using queuing from her yes just lovely and then with the second client she's a thinker and so much about like story and history it was lovely I wonder if you could just elaborate briefly on that. 

00:45:10
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Yes Well we like to be on the one hand spontaneous and, and really try to as you may have noticed we were really interested and we'd like to work with the person there. We're with and each person is unique and, and as we noticed it and try to really address that well we have a variety of ways to work and we encourage you to develop varieties to have a sort of a vocabulary you know that you can speak together to, to help you really get in tune because it's together I mean this is a this is a cooperative kind of endeavor. 

00:45:50
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS And then of course you know, as you very astutely noticed I mean you try to speak the language of the person you want to be in the present moment in the way that you are in the present moment so some of us are more little more left hemisphere dominant we're more verbal you know we like to put things into words and then we know what they are other people are a little more right hemisphere you know they tend to be more sort of intuitive, emotional and so they speak more in sensory sort of you know, maybe not quite as verbal and both ways are ways of being present so you know when you think of mindfulness it isn't just sort of one thing it depends on how you process information as to how you're going to be present in the moment and of course you can expand your repertoire to include the other modalities but we always try to start from where you know, in (inaudible ) and where the person is the unique individual individuality of the person that's, that's the best place to start and then the client is comfortable there you're speaking their language and it flows. 

00:46:50
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS And it's genuine and there are genuine this is you recognize you know is really there and we like that instead of trying to impose some structure we want to be together present in a good dialogue and then good things can happen from that we feel and it's spontaneous. 

00:47:10
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So think of your mindfulness when you're practicing it in your work it's you're not sort of now I'm being mindful and all the therapeutic sort of wisdom that you have this is set aside you bring it to that, mindfulness is like the doorway you walk through but you walk through with as the therapist that you are so utilize all of your therapeutic skills but bring it into the mindful moment. Non-judgmentally in the present moment accepting things as they are it's very it's a simple thing and it's very deep and it's very therapeutic as you could see. 

00:47:45
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS And as we were trying to show and honestly demonstrating we hope when you walk through that door you walk through it together with the client, you don't just push the client through it you're right there with the person and so you live and you live your mindfulness and you practice it and we try to and we know that you will as well. 

00:48:10
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS And that is our clients both of them really showed you I think it's wonderful that we have this resource because that when you need it in your life when life throws you a curve you have that ability and you handle it better everything is easier when you're mindful. 

00:48:20
ALEXANDER SIMPKINS And it comes it should as it should very naturally and spontaneously Well I think our time is up, thank you very much. 

00:48:25
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Thank you everybody.
