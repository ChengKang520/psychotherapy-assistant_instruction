LISA PORCHE BURKE Our first keynote this morning promises to be an exciting and provocative one. It's my pleasure to introduce to you, Dr. Claude Steele. Claude Steele has been a professor of Psychology at Stanford University since 1991 and before that, served on the Faculties of the University of Michigan, -

LISA PORCHE BURKE  -The University of Washington and the University of Utah. His research interests are in three areas. Throughout his career, he has been interested in processes of self-evaluation in particular in how people cope with self-image threat. This work has led to a general theory of self-affirmation processes. A second interest growing out of the first is the theory of how group stereotypes by posing an extra self-evaluative and belongingness threat to such groups as African Americans in all academic domains and women in quantitative domains can influence intellectual performance and academic identities. Third, he has long been interested in addictive behaviors, particularly alcohol addiction where his work with several colleagues led to a theory of alcohol myopia, a theory in which many of alcohols social and stress-reducing effects that may underlie its addictive capacity are explained as a consequence of alcohol's narrowing of perceptual and cognitive functioning. He received his B.A. degree from Hiram College in Hiram, Ohio and his Ph.D. in Psychology from the Ohio State University in 1971. He has served as a member of the Board of Directors of the American Psychological Society and as president of the Western Psychological Association. He has also served as the chair of the Executive Committee of the Society of Experimental Social Psychologist, as a member of the Executive committee of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology and on the editorial boards of numerous journals and study sections at both the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse. He is a fellow of the APS and the APA, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Education. And he is the recipient of a Cattell Faculty Fellowship from the Cattell Foundation and the 1996 Gordon Allport Intergroup Relations Prize. He currently holds an endowed chair as Lucy Stern professor in the Social Sciences and as chair of the Psychology department at Stanford University. He is close to Jesus as they come. So without further ado, let me give you the renowned Dr. Claude Steele.

CLAUDE M. STEELE  That's gonna be hard to live up to there. (laughs) So bear with me. (laughs) Ah, it's, it's, it's a great pleasure to, to, ah, be here and to, ah, help launch, ah, -

CLAUDE M. STEELE Ah, this summit. And, uhm, I was just thinking I've never been part of that ceremony before but it, it does make one feel at home here and, ah, in this, this part of psychology. So, it's a real honor to, to be a part of that. Uhm, I would, ah, just like to describe basically our research program. Ah, it is focused on two concepts, stereotype threats and disidentification. Ah, these are very general psychological processes. We intended to be general. And in recent years, they have been increasingly researched as very general processes. Ah, but we have in our work used them to try to understand some of the school achievement problems faced by certain groups in society. Ah, so, that would probably the focus of, of, of what I'll talk, talk about today but I'd, I'd like to sort of point to the fact that, that the, ah, processes ap, apply to, are experienced by everyone and applied to a broad range of phenomenon. Ah, we have focused primarily on the work on, on the wo, women in mathematics and, ah, ah, other minority groups in particular African Americans, ah, ah, Latino Americans and Native Americans, ah, are pretty much across the academic board. Ah, this work is, I, is really prompted by an interest in a, a problem that has in the recent years come to be, ah, talked about as the achievement gap problem. I'm, I'm sure you're quite familiar with, with that idea. Ah, it usually refers to, ah, a minority group in particular in school, ah, on standardized tests having a lower performance level than other students who take the test or who in, who are in the same school. (clears throat) Ah, it is a, ah, a problem that with our new president, ah, ah, it seems as if, ah, there is going to be a renewed focus on it. Ah, ah, I think it's, I don't wanna give the Republicans complete credit for that but (laughs) it is a problem that has, that, that, that, you know, the, the importance of which, ah, ah, I think everybody recognizes. Ah, why would a psychologist be interested in it? I think there are a couple of features of these achievement gaps that make it interesting to psychologists. Ah, the first is that the achievement gaps occur in the middle class of these groups as much as they do in the lower classes of these groups. This goes against somewhat the idea that the, ah, gap is coming entirely from, ah, preparational differences, preparational disadvantages. Ah, also, ah, it occurs at selective schools as much as it does at less selective schools. It occurs at, ah, almost every single level of schooling, in law school as well as in, ah, the early years of K-12 schooling. Ah, it occurs, ah, ah, Bok and Bowen and, and their book, Shape of the River has some interesting data showing that at the college level expected, especially at selective colleges, ah, the achievement gap, the great gap is greatest among students who enter those colleges with the highest SAT scores. Ah, so, it isn't strictly a matter of preparation, ah, and the factors that, ah, ah, that lead to, ah, preparation. I, I wanna come back to that if I can because I, I don't want to, to leave the impression that I think it's all psychological. It isn't but I do think that there is a psychological component to it and that is what invited us into this problem. So, what I'll do today in my, ah, 30 minutes is to, ah, describe a little bit the concept of stereotype threat and disindentification. I'll review that a little bit. I'll talk about some of the early experiments that demonstrate the phenomenon. And then, ah, I would like you just take you on sort of a journey that our research has taken us on, ah, through a series of questions which I think refine, ah, at least we like to believe, refine our understanding of the, of the phenomenon. Ah, questions like which kinds of students are most affected by this process of stereotype threat and disidentification, ah, getting a surprising answer to that question, ah, it raises the deeper question of, ah, what is the nature of this threat? What is the kind of concern that the person has when they're experiencing this kind of threat? Is it a concern about the self and one's own abilities or is it a concern about the environment and one's sense of security and belongingness in the environment that is at the heart of the, of the phenomenon. And then finally, I'd like to, to point, ah at least tentatively to some general principles of remedy. If it is this, if this, this problem is, ah, a significant part of the underperformance problem, ah, what can you do to fix it? What can you do to improve things? Ah, and I, I probably won't have time but I'd love to have time to extrapolate this to a couple of policy, (chuckles) issues. One has to do with, ah, ah, what we're about to, ah, eh, eh, I, I, I guess intensify which is the National Testing program. I think our research has a very direct, ah, implications and I have some real concerns about that. And also, ah, the second policy, the kind of concern is just what of kind of, ah, ah, what, how do you design schooling in a way, in such a way as to reduce this kind of threat and its detrimental effects on, on academic performance? So, that's what I'd like to do. Ahm, stereotype threat is, ah, simply refers to the experience, of, ah, being in a situation or doing something for which a negative stereotype about your group applies. As soon as you know, as soon as you're doing something, you're in, in a situation where you know that you're group could be seen in a certain way. You know that you could be judged or treated in terms of that negative stereotype. It's a situational pressure, situational reality, part of the situation. You know at that moment at that you could be seen that way, treated that way or that you might inadvertently do something that would confirm the stereotype. Ah, if you're doing something that you really care about, this prospect of being seen this way, being reduced to a negative stereotype can be disturbing, upsetting, distracting, ah, ah, and, and the like. Ah, as you can see, I think everybody in the world experience a stereotype threat. We are all part of one group or another that has negatives, there's, for which negative stereotypes exist. Every group, you can't think of a group that doesn't have negative stereotypes about, the young, the old, Baptists, Methodists, psychologists, lawyers. (laughs) The list goes on. I, I have this, ah, ah, experience which I, I like to tell to illustrate is, ah, being department chair, ah, and having our Department of Psychology shifted from the, being a Social Science in the Social Science Division at Stanford to, to the Natural Science Division at Stanford. So, I use to report to a Social Science Dean and compete for resources with Social Science chairs. And then all of a sudden, I was reporting to a Natural Science Dean and competing with, with Natural Science chairs for resources. And I experience a very vivid form of stereotype threat. Ah, (laughs) I'm speaking to psychologists so you know what I'm talking about here (laughs). Ah, but I, I felt that they could see psychology as a kind of mushy science. And you know, compared to Molecular Biology and Astrophysics, ah, ah, that I might have to make a really hard case for the, for the department. And so, I did find myself, ah, in anticipation, or, or apprehension about being perceived this way. Adjusting how I presented psy, psychology, I, I found myself presenting the hardest edge of psychology, you know. Psychology is really, you know, substantially a neuroscience and, ah, (laughs) we're, we're, we do big science in the psychology. We don't do little booklet stuff. We do really, you know, (laughs) I was like self-hating social psychologist there for (laughs). I hope you'll forgive me but (laughs) but it, it certainly illustrates this. No one said a word to me, ah, that they were seeing psychology in this way but I just had the sense, you know, quite unconsciously and I, I had to realize this from observing my behavior. Quite unconsciously that I was contending with a stereotype about the field of, of psychology and presenting myself, engineering myself to, to, to do that. Well, our, our ro, work has focused on the possibility that the same kind of stereotype threat, ah, ah, especially in relation to groups whose intellectual abilities are negatively stereotyped. That this kind of threat, the same kind of threat I felt there, ah, may play a significant role in their underperformance in school and on standardized test. It's the heart of the idea. In two ways, this could happen. One, as I probably illustrated, ah, if you're performing in that, in that domain, an intellectual domain and you are a member of a group whose intellectual abilities are negatively stereotyped, you realize you could be seen that way. And you realize you could be treated that way and that people may hold you under suspicion because of that stereotype. And the, the whole sequelae of things could happen. And, and that prospect, if you care about doing well in school could right there be upsetting, distracting and undermine your performance on that situation or undermine your interactions in that situation. That's one way. The other is that if this persists for a long period of time, ah, you're in, every time you're in this domain, you kinda feel this way. You feel this discomfort, this sense of, of threat in the situation. You may get weary of it, tired of it and either leave the domain or in a sense sort of psychol-, if you can't leave it so quickly, you may sort of psychologically disindentify with it, make it less important to who you are. Drop it, reduce it as a personal identity. Then, this, then, the apprehension you feel there just isn't that important to yourself. Ahm, well, that is the whole theory of, of the way stereotype threat translates into, ah, differences, may affect differences in academic perfo-, ah, performance. You can see what we're trying to do here is to explain how the stereotype structure of a given society, the structures that characterize a particular society could come down into the lives of the individuals in that society in such a way as to affect important performances, academic performances, test performances and to thereby also affect identities that we have, that we feel comfortable with and thereby affect identities that entire groups of people feel comfortable having. So, as an attempt to bring the social world down into the psychological world in such a way as to explain some important, ah, aspects of, of school achievement. Well, some of the first experiments were very straightforward. One, we did with women in math, ah, was very simple. We simply brought very, ah, talented women and men, math students at the University of Michigan into the laboratory one at a time and gave them a very difficult standardized, ah, math test. It was a section of the, the math test you take if, if you're a math major and you're applying for a subsequent for graduate school in, in an area that's gonna require math, hard test, 25-minute test. Ah, we rea-, we reasoned from our theory that this would be a different situation for women than it would be for men. And the reason we felt this was that when women are in this situation at the moment they begin to experience and these are also I point women who, ah, ah, care very much about doing well at math. We, we selected them for being very good at it. They, they had taken at least two math courses and gotten at least a B to two Calculus courses and got a least a B in, in those courses. They told us that math is very important to their personal identity and their professional goals. So, these were selected people who were, who, for whom math was very important. But in the middle of this very difficult test at the frontier of their skills, we reasoned the experience would be different for women than it would be for men. It would look like it was the same. It would be the same test, the same desk, the same room, the same pictures on the wall but it, it was, psychologically be a very different experience for women than it would be for men because as women experience that frustration, there is available, a stereotype in our society that alleges a group- based limitation of ability in that domain. And for somebody who really cares about doing well and you're out here at the frontier of your skills, that frustration could signal that you've reached that limitation or that you're going to be seen as having reached that limitation. And for somebody who has really trying to do well on this domain, this is gonna be upsetting, distracting and their performance may on that standardized test go down right there. For men, they have concerns too about their own abilities and so on. Ah, but they, and we selected them for, for being very strong in math and for being just as, as, for it's being very important to them but they don't have this extra possibility of their frustration signaling, bringing in a group stereotype about their, ah, lack of ability or limitation of ability in this domain. So, that's the psychological difference bet, bet between the two groups of people in this situation. One group has this other, ah, reputation to contend with their, ah, and the other doesn't. Ah, well, I hope the overhead, ah, ah, works. I'll show you what happened here.

00:17:45
CLAUDE M. STEELE  Ah, as you can see, ah, women in that situation do not perform as well as the men in that situation pretty dramatically, ah, different, ah, ah, lower there. Even though, it's important to stress, they have the same skills in Math and the same motivation at, ah, coming into the situation. Well, ah, there is a dastardly alternative explanation, ah, which was brought to our attention very quickly, ah, is one I think psychology has too much possession of, too much identity with and that is the biological aspect issue. That, well, what you have found here, ah, is the same, ah, pattern of data that Benbow and Stanley used to make the argument that there is a biological difference between women and men in this math domain. They got very talented eighth grade boys and girls, ah, top two percentile on their California Aptitude Test. They gave them a very difficult test at the frontier of their skills, ah, an SAT, ah, exam and they found the boys did a heck of a lot better than the girls just like what we found. And they said, "Well, we, we don't like to come to this conclusion but the boys and the girls have had the same kind of, of education, educational experience with regard to math up to this point. They're performing at the same level on the, in the eighth grade and yet they don't do as well. Maybe this reflects a biological difference that doesn't present itself until we present very difficult work in that it emerges." Well, ah, we have to separate our explanation from their explanation. We have to show that if you take the stereotype threat out of this testing situation for women, if you remove for, for them, the, the possibility of being seen in terms of that stereotype about their group here then their performance in this situation should go up if our story is correct. If their story is correct, it should stay down no matter what you do because it's coming from a biological source. Well, we remove the stereotype in the stereotype threat in the next, ah, condition of the experiment in a very simple way, we simply told both the men and the women as they sat down to take this test that this particular test was a test on which men and women always do the same. It is incapable of discriminating between men and women as a, as a group on this particular test. Never has had that ability to discriminate between the two, the two sexes and never will. So you don't need to worry about that on this test. You may have heard that that happens on other tests that men outperform women but not this particular test. (coughing) Okay. That's what happens when you do that. So I would say I wouldn't be here if that didn't happen. (laughing) 

00:20:35
[sil.] 

00:20:35
CLAUDE M. STEELE  (laughing) Yeah, right. Don't worry I keep it to myself. All right. (laughing). Uhm, well. Ah, this, this is was, uhm this is the first study we did and have exactly the same reaction you did. We were really excited about this (laughs). Uhm, we quickly did it with regard to race and we done it with a whole bunch of other groups. At this point, I wanted to just mention ah, some, some, some more recent findings with regard to gender just to, just ah, to, to catalogue them. Uhm, there's one that I, that I, I think shows this effect in an interesting way because it shows that this sort of mundane features of everyday life can arou, arou, arouse this stereotyping or, arouse the sense of threat. This was ah, an experiment in which subjects were brought in and they looked at six television commercials and in one condition the six commercials were just that six commercials. In the other condition, two of the commercials involved women as the main protagonist in the commercial and the women was, were behaving in rather silly ways, you know, one woman was sort of bouncing on the bed excited about a laundry detergent and so on. Ah, so it's just the kind of garden variety television commercials but it was projecting women in a very ah, ah, you know, silly, demeaning, probab, probably way. So, they watched these because this because this, this is part of a memory experiment, they're gonna have to be tested for recall later. And while they're waiting for that we give them a, a standardized, difficult standardized ah, test. Only on this test it starts out with math, difficult math again but at any time you want to you can shift away from doing math to shifting into doing into verbal ah, ah, responses, now in verbal ah, items. Now verb, verbal the verbal domain is not a domain where women have are negatively stereotyped, where their abilities are negatively stereotyped, anything that maybe a slightly positive stereotype there about women in that domain. So, ah, here's what happened, first I'll give you the results with regard to performance. Ah, you see here pretty much the same thing. This is the stereotypic ah, condition and they, they're seeing that commercial with the women depicted in a silly way in it. And you get the same thing on math items women underperformed in relation to men on that. For the neutral ah, items, they this, there's somewhat of a difference there but not as much. Over here on the verbal items you start to see women performing actually better than men in that ah, situation. But this isn't the important of this experiment really. Ah, what I wanted to show here is to catch disidentification right in the act of, of, of happening. Ah, the next data I'm gonna present ah, is data which sh, which shows, ah, should I? (chuckles) Oh, that would, that would help, wouldn't it? 

00:23:25
LISA PORCHE BURKE Yeah. 

00:23:25
CLAUDE M. STEELE  Great, ah, the next data I'm gonna present show ah, what women attempt to do. What kind of a, of a, a problem, test item they ah, ah, attempt to do. Ah, do they start with math and shift over to doing verbal items? And this is what's kinda interesting to me. 

00:23:45
CLAUDE M. STEELE  Ah, in the stereotypic condition, what can you see is that, went just as a result of having seeing that particular commercial women start to do fewer math problems. They sort of just shift out of that, out of that domain entirely stopped doing them. When they're watching neutral commercials, interestingly they don't do that. But when they're watching ah, commercials that are have this kind of content to them, ah, that alone is enough to cause them to sort of shift out of that domain into a, a safer domain where you can see they're, they're shifting over to the verbal items. Or a, a place where they don't feel the same kind of ah, threat. And I just want to present that because I think it sort of captures the, the how one reacts to that threat and the small, uhm, the tiny cues in one's environment that are sufficient to ah, produce it. Ah, there are other data here showing that just as a result of watching their commercials they're less interested in math majors and also less interested in math ah, careers. Ah, okay. Uhm, I'm gonna go right to our studies on race ah, they basically we're done to see if the same things that happen to women in math would happen to minority groups in this case, African Americans ah, in a, on a test across this, this was a verbal test. It wasn't a math test because the stereotype about African American's intellectual ability is not confined to some particular area of intellectual life it's pretty general. So we shift to the content of the test and ah, ah, it's fair to say that we got basically the same kind of ah, ah, same pattern of, of results. What uhm, the way we did the experiment was of the, quite parallel to the gender one. We got white and Black students at the uni, at the Stanford University, very strong students. Brought them in one at a time, gave them a very difficult ah, verbal test, a test in literature, the advanced tests, the GRE exam in Literature, a 25-minute ah, exam, very hard exam. In the condition where we wanted them to experience this threat, ah, we simply mentioned that this was a test of verbal ability. You don't have to mention that, it's a test of verbal ability. They assume that anyway. Ah, by making it be a test of ability, you make the stereotype about African-Americans relevant to, experience, experiencing frustration on that test. That's all you have to do, is sit down, present the test as a test of ability and African Americans know that a stereotype about their group now is relevant to an inter, to the interpretation of their ah, ah, performance on that test. Well under those conditions ah, Black students very dramatically underperformed compared to white students and I'll present it this way. This is where the test is diagnostic of ability. Ah, in the condition where we wanted to turn the stereotype threat off in this experiment we simply presented the same test but this time we presented it as not a test of individual differences and ability but as an instrument we use in our laboratory to study problem solving and it's incapable of measuring individual differences and abilities. So you could take this, you can do this task without any fear that it reflects on your ability as an individual. They had this sort of peculiar freedom in this situation from the prospect of being seen through the lens of that stereotype that would ordinarily in everyday life be there. So again, under that kind of condition, their performance goes up. Ah, over the years, we, we find out we, we learn a great deal more about what's going on here. Ah, for example in this, in this condition, ah as soon as students sit down to take this test ah, negative stereotypes about their group are activated. They're cognitively available. This also present a motivation to avoid being seen by the stereo, by the stereotype to behave in ways that are actually counter-stereotypic, explicitly counter-stereotypic so as to deflect the possibility of being seen through the lens of the stereotype in that condition. Ah, and so also ah, most perniciously, their blood pressure is, is significantly elevated in this condition. Their vascular blood pressure which is the form of blood pressure that's related to ah, hypertension most ah, predictive of, of hypertension in this ah, situation. Okay, ah, the, the first point you wanna make after you present data like these is, at least my impulse is to, is to point out very carefully, this is, this is something that happens to a lot of groups. We can produce exactly the same pat, ah, ah, pattern of results in white males by giving them a test and just before they take it tell them that this is a test on which Asians tend to do better than, than whites. Ah, so now, ah this, this again is something that for very motivated white male math students, these are the subjects, these were ah, ah, graduate students of engineering at Stanford. A very motivated and very good care a lot about this but are taking a test in which all of a sudden they're under a form of stereotype threat. A kind of negative light of another group's positive ah, ah, stereotype and under that condition they underperformed compared to what they ordinarily would could do. Ah, it's also been looked at in sports, I don't know if some of you are real have, have seen this, this ah, research but it seems to be a burgeoning ah, ah, area. One is a simple golf task where ah, ah elite athletes of the University of Arizona, white and Black are, are, are performing in a, a little miniature golf course. Their score is how many strokes it takes to get through 10 holes in this course in one condition where you want the whites athletes to be under stereotype threat, the task is presented as, "This is a test of natural athletic ability." Boom. So (laughs), (coughs). You do that (laughs) and it befuddles them, and they don't score as well and Blacks of course, you know, embolden by that stereotype, you know, really killed that, that test. I'm looking at James over there I know who's a golfer. (laughs) You've gotta try that man (laughs) (coughs). But the tables are turned when the same test is presented put the, put Black athletes under disadvantage, white athletes under advantage by presenting the same task is a task on ah, "This is a measure of sports strategic intelligence." Then the results flipped. Whites outperformed Blacks on this, this sort of thing. Ah well, I just wanted to point there, there are a variety of other ah, of studies that show the generality of the effect in a variety of groups at this point. Ah, about this time though we embarked on another ah, ah, feature of it. Trying to get a deeper understanding of how stereotype threat would play its role in academic ah, outcomes. We went to Los Angeles in an inner city high school. We replicated this study here and we found something very interesting which was that ah, this, this pattern of results only occur among the very strongest, most identified students. It did not occur among the students who were less identified with doing, doing well in school, didn't care about doing well at school. That's of course implicit in our theory but to have the actual data was pretty surprising. Ah, this is what it looks like. Uhm, this is all for Black students. Ah, these are students who don't iden, who didn't identify very much with school. This is, these are students who do identify with school and you can that when you don't, didn't identify, it didn't make any difference whether that test was diagnostic or non-diagnostic. Whether that stereotype was available as an interpretation or not. They came in, they did their best for you, got frustrating they quit, "I'm outta here doc, thanks a lot." Ah for the students however, who really care a lot about this. Ah, you can see when you took the stereotype threat off of them such that the test was non-diagnostic of ability their performance shoots up again. But under normal circumstances where you just give them this difficult ah, test, their performance looks just like the performance of the kids who don't care so much. Ah, the, the psychology of these students is very different than the psychology of these students and this I think is something we've missed in our, in our understanding of this achievement gap. That there are several psychologies at play here if for a minute you'll forgive me and allow me to call these people the "Vanguard" of the group, and these people the "Rearguard" of the group. Ah, I think that our stereotype understanding of, of underachievement comes from the psychology descriptive of the Rearguard of the group and less descriptive of that cutting-edge Vanguard of the group. At every level of schooling, ah, let's say you're following a group of ah, Latino students ah, Black students through school, there is probably almost every situation some portion of that group that is very identified with doing well in school and is trying very hard. That, the, the burden of that group is not low expectations, low motivation, anything of that sort, that the burden of that group is stereotype threat or, in similar kinds of, of phenomenon. Now as they continue to experience that threat in that domain, in that school over a period of time, they may join through this identification, the Rearguard. A member of today's, you know, Vanguard may be a member of tomorrow's Rearguard because they are clearly dealing with a, a, an, an extra amount of threat in their ah, ah, performance here. Well, this lead us into somewhat different, if this is the case then, in, in our work is sort of been focusing on this ah, ah, Vanguard here ah, could we do something to bring that psychology into view more, more, more clearly. And I'll post two explanations. The standard explanation for the achievement gap ah, is the explanation that I think we psychologists are responsible for and certainly one I probably held going into this ah, ah, research is that ah, it's ancient theory in the 20th century ah, which is that, as a member an, a negatively stereotyped group, I'm exposed to that over the course of my life, Gordon Allport's terms, “It's hammered, hammered, hammered into me," ah I take those negative views with me, I internalize them as, as, ah, uhm, in the old days they would could itself hatred. In these days it's more like ah, low expectations for myself and then when I'm in situations with those expectations are relevant ah, I still fulfill them. And so low performance is ah, ah, a sort of an exercise of a self-fulfilling prophecy. But that did not apply to the, the psychology of the Vanguard of, of, of, of the group, of the students who are still very much identified with it. They're often have very strong skills, every time you measure them they have very high expectations about what they're doing. They're struggling, trying very hard. They're not scoring very low in this test because they're giving up their giving up. They're scoring because they're trying too hard, they're changing the, their answers. They're re-reading the stems of the question. Their blood pressure ah, is elevated. They are really trying to do it here. These people, no blood pressure elevation. The frustration, they are out of there (laughs). Uhm, so, that, that's that one story. So what would it, what would the other story be? Well our other, the other story ah, that, that comes into view maybe that they're worried not so much about themselves and their own abilities but their security in the, in the environment. That they are just features of the environment that signal to them that their social identity as African Americans ah, ah, or as minority students ah, puts them under, under some threat in this environment. Now when you think about it that way, you get a very different picture of things. Ah, you can think about people as having a kind of detector if you will. That is picking up cues all of us have this detector that picks up cues as to whether ah, given social identity we have our, our, our sex, our, our race, our sexual orientation, our age. Ah, whether these things in some situation is gonna cause us to be seen in a way we don't like, to be devalued in some way. And all kinds of cues bear on that detector set that detector off. Ah, I think it exists psychologically as almost like a theory of mind that I have coming into a situation a theory of other people's minds. What could they think of me? What are the possible ideas about me and my group that are relevant to me in, in this situation? And I'm picking up cues that make that theory of mine very strong, "Uh-oh! They really could be thinking of me this way," or "They may not be thinking of me this way." And when you think about the way American ah, let's say higher education is organized, you can see there are a lot of cues out there that just set that detector off around the iden, the social identities of race and minority status and gender and so on. Ah, first you're in a, in a minority. Your, your group is in a minority. That tells you there that that social identity ah, isn't gonna, isn't, doesn't have the, you know, isn't the dominant perspective here. Ah, there are, there's probably ah, for lack of a better term, a cultural hegemony in place on most college campuses for example that marginalizes your identity further the, the way you do things is not the dominant way things are done here. So that signals ah, something. Often on college campuses there's a very small range of how can you be a smart and cool person (chuckles). And a lot of those, those prototypes of smart and cool people do not include your own group ah, your social life, your romantic life are very intensely organized around this social identity. Ah, so all of these things tell you this is a very meaningful identity that I've got in, in, in this situation. And so that maybe the, the in a sense the default concern that this Vanguard has as it goes through school. Is, is, it's, isn't so much of concern about themselves as much as it is a concern about their security. Their ability to be appreciated in the environments they're in. They walk into psychology classes and hear lectures on the Bell Curve. They sit in, in the cafeteria and here ah, you know, them, their, their group degraded around affirmative action policies and the like. There's just all these cues, they trouble them around this ah, this social identity. Well, ah, we try to pit these two explanations against each other in an experiment ah, ah, I wouldn't claim it's an experiment it's definitive but it suggested and there's a number of data which I think the sets of studies that bear on this. In this experiment, we try to do what our initial impulse was. Let's take, take the Black students and before they take this difficult test we give them, let's, let's really bolster their confidence, as much as we possibly can. So we did this in an anagram ah, test. We gave them like a half-hour, 45 minutes of anagrams where you have to unscramble the letters and make a word. You can make those look very difficult but be very easy. So you can actually give a student a real success there. And then you for, you know, 35 to 40 minutes and you tell them that this success is a, this is a deep measure of verbal ability. So they were, were, were, have really feel you measure how much they, how confident they are and you know, they're really confident in this, in this situation. You give them the same old test we do. The same thing happens. Big stereotype threat effects, Black students underperforming in relation to ah, ah, white students and no gain whatsoever. But if you make the environment more secure, and in this experiment we did this by trying to convince them, that this test was a racially fair test. Now ah, I have to halt here (laughs). That is hard to do. Ah, we had to go to great lengths and basically the only thing that worked after, you know, 6, 7 months of, of messing around was to present the test as a test made by an integrated research team. Lots of Black researchers were involved in this test and, and you haven't heard about this test yet because you only have the 25 items that you're gonna take, otherwise you probably would have heard about this in the newspapers but it's really a completely fair test. Here's the pictures of the researchers who have, ah, it's been, (coughs) (laughs) it's been validated at Howard and Harvard and so on and so on. Uhm, then you can (inaudible )and, and when you do that their performance goes up dramatically. I got the overhead here. It's worth, ah, putting up here. Uhm, this is the condition where they are given successful anagrams and it's a typical test and you can see we replicate pretty much the, the standard, stereotype to that effect, white students don't perfo, perform a lot better than Black students. But, ah, here, we're under the fair test, ah, Black students performance goes up dramatically. And even when they are given failure experiences on those anagrams so that their expectancies are real low here in this case, ah, their performance stays pretty high. White students' performances are very effective by its expectancy but Black students' performances now, well, sort of helps you point to the point that, to the point that, what Black students are concerned about here is the, you know, what kind of world am I in? Am I in a world that is gonna appreciate me, who's gonna see my abilities? What, what, is that stereotype gonna bug me? It's a preoccupation. With, with women in Math, ah, an interesting paper published in Psychological Sciences made the, the, the, show the demonstration that when women come in and take this test, the magnitude, ah, of the stereotype threat effect, the degree to which you suppress their performance vary as a function of how many other men there were, how many men there were in the testing situation. So when they are all women, their perform, they weren't that affected by it. When they were a lot of, when there are few women and replaced by men, then there, there was a great deal more stereotype threat and lower performance in that situation. Well I cite these because they show, the, the, how, how subtle the sources of this threat are because in a largest part the threat is about, I wanna argue here just to put, put this in its strongest form, this threat is about my, how welcome am I in this environment? And I'm picking up all kinds of cues which are going to address that theory that I've got in my mind? Am I welcome here or am I not welcome here? And all kinds of cues, the presence of my, the numbers of my other group, the status of my other group, all of these things that are present in the situation affect the sense of apprehension or threat that I can feel in that situation around my, around this particular venue. Well in the way of remedy, how you'll fix this, ah, I'll say something glib and then I'll try to point to some concrete examples. But, ah, the glib thing is that if you want to, you know, if you want to reduce this threat, you have to do things. You have to presume that it's gonna be there in most of the situations that we're, that we're dealing with in, in school in United States. That's the important thing right there. You have to assume that the situation might look the same time, as I think I'm running out of time. (laughs) Uhm, well let me just, ah, point one example then I'll, I'll stop and let Jack take over. Ah, this, this example is, is I, I think a simple, and, and a heartening one. It's, it's useful in mentoring(ph) situations. Ah, how do you give feedback across the racial divide? Well, ah, I, skip right to the, to the most effective way to do that. Have, use high standards but affirm the student's ability to meet those things. Ah, when you do that, when you, when you look at the person's product, their work, and you say, "This is, this is good work and we're using very high standards and I think you can meet those standards," you're signaling to that person that the stereotype about their group is not in play with regard to how they're, they're being, how they're being treated and regarded in, in this situation, and that produces a very dramatic, almost, ah, uhm, it's, it's almost a, uhm, never, I've never seen anything like this in the literature before, increase in motivation among, among minority students. Well there are a variety of other things but I better stop at this point. Thank you.

00:44:15
DERALD SUE  Thank you, ah, Dr. Steele. You know, ah Claude was saying that, ah, one of the aspects that made for his success in being here was the outcome of his studies. I submit to you that the success of the social psychologist is their ability to lie with a straight face. 

00:44:50
Derald Wing Sue, Ph.D 

00:44:50
DERALD SUE Ah, and, you know, as I, as I stand here before you, I'm going to introduce another successful uhm, social psychologist and I look out in the audience and there is Dr. Philip Zambardo(ph) who, ah, recently elected, ah, ah, president of APA and I'm thinking, "God help us." (laughs) And then I also asked myself, you know, does the, does the specialty attract people who lie well or does the, or does this specialty produce good liars. I mean that, ah, in any case, ah, (laughs) ah, let me introduce our ah, second keynoter, John F. Dovidio is Charles A. Dana Professor and Chair of the Department of Psychology at Colgate University. He has served as Director of the Division of the University Studies and Director of the Division of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. Dr. Dovidio has been editor of Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin and he is currently associate editor of Group Processes and Intergroup Relations. He has been president of the Society for Psychological Study of Social Issues, Division 9 of APA, and Secretary Treasurer of the Society for the, ah, for Experimental Social Psychology. Dr. Dovidio is considered one of the foremost researchers on stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination, social power and nonverbal communication and altruism and helping. His research has been instrumental in helping us understand the complexities of racism and anti-racism. He has published over 100 books, articles and chapters on these topics. He shares the Gordon Oport(ph) Intergroup Relations Prize with Samuel Gaertner for their work on aversive racism and the ways to reduce bias. Dr. Dovidio regularly makes presentations on the topic of modern racism for professional and general audiences. As part of the panel testifying before President Clinton's Race Advisory Board in 1997, I have the opportunity of hearing Jack present eloquently his research and conclusions on the evolution of traditional and modern racism. Brothers and sisters, all of us who have worked on the field of multicultural education and psychology have read the works of doctors Claude Steele and Jack Dovidio. We have had the pleasure of hearing from Dr. Steele already and now we have the double treat of hearing from Dr. Dovidio. The topic of his presentation this morning, Why Can't We Get Along, interpersonal biases and interracial distrust. It gives me great pleasure to introduce a much admired white brother, Dr. Jack Dovidio.

John F. Dovidio, Ph.D 

00:48:05
JOHN F. DOVIDIO Is better? ah, thanks. ah, I'm, I'm really honored to be here and I'm, ah, I'm very, very humbled by this, ah, of course the two introductions just don't help because, ah, Derald's introduction, introduced me as a successful liar, ah, (laugh) and the first introduction, it's really, basically introduce me as a follower of Jesus, so, ah, (laugh) so either way, (laugh) ahm, so I, I do see this as an honor but in many ways I'm scared that what am I gonna say to you today are things that you already know, not because you've read my work or you've heard me speak or because you know it through your experience and you know it through your heart. Ah, but what I'm gonna try to do is document it, systematize it, ahm, integrate it around a single theory of modern racism we call aversive racism and try to put it together in a coherent story. So I don't think that what I'm going to say is new, but I think I may be saying it in a new or different way. And the work that Sam Gaertner and I have done on aversive racism, which is, I'm just gonna call a subtle modern form of racism, we use the, the more generic term, was based really on a couple of observations a number of years ago. And the first observation was that America had been changing in dramatic ways across time, and in general, the racial attitudes of white Americans towards the minorities in general and towards Blacks in particular, have, becoming less negative and more positive. And today, because I only have a half an hour, I want to focus on Black-white relations, which in many ways have been the defining relations in America historically, but I can also later on, through questions, talk about this in terms of biases towards other groups as well. But across time, you can see that the racial attitudes of white Americans has really been changing dramatically across time. For example, in 1933, 75% of the white respondent survey describe Blacks as lazy, and by, by 2000, that figure declines to just 2%. Now these data which are based on college samples also nicely track nationwide, ah, survey data as well. For example, the Gallup Organization to the first time in 1958, asked white American voters, "Would you be willing to vote for a well-qualified Black presidential candidate?" And whereas the majority of the white Americans said no to that in 1958, today, over 90% said they, said they would. Now, that's a dramatic change. Of course you can also see there's some bad news here, is that is, today, still about 8% of the white population say they will not vote for a well-qualified Black presidential candidate simply because that person is Black. Now think about that. I've been trying to find a well-qualified presidential candidate for years and I haven't found yet, you know? (laugh) And it's amazing. These, these people say even if they found one they wouldn't vote for that person simply because they're Black. What the hell are they thinking, you know? (laugh) So on the one hand you see these dramatic changes towards (inaudible ) turn with a majority of white Americans say they're not prejudiced And believe that discrimination no longer exist. On the other hand, this ample evidence, you see it in the newspaper of discrimination against Blacks. You see it on restaurants(ph), college campuses and you see it in a continuation of racial disparities in our society. For example, ah, here are basic industries(ph), but let me just talk about unemployment. This is the ratio of unemployment for African-Americans relative to white Americans, 1949 to 1994. The unemployment rate for African-Americans has typically been two to three times the rate for white Americans. But interesting, things, there's no better now than they were in 1949. Things are getting better for everybody, but the disparity between Blacks and whites continues to persist 30 years later. So what we see is, ahm, changes in America with things seem to be getting better in terms of racial attitudes, but we also seem to find an inconsistency in terms of this, in terms of the disparities and discrimination that persist in our society. How can we account for this discrepancy? Well, looking to this question, Sam Gaertner and I really began at the beginning and what we tried to do is start from the beginning and say, "What are the reasons of why people might be likely to develop biases in the first place? And when we went through this exercise, we developed the list, and when we did that I was struck by three things. First of all, the list was quite long, that there are a nuhmber of processes that will contribute to the development of bias. Second of all, these processes fall neatly fall into three categories: Cognitive which deals with the way people think, motivational, which deals with the fact that we have basic needs and try to satisfy those needs, and socio-cultural, which deals with the fact that we absorbs the values of our society. And the third, and I think very enlightening thing for me, was contrary to what I have read earlier about the psycho-pathology or the abnormality of prejudice, these processes are rooted in normal, often functional psychological processes that help us deal with a word that is complex and a word that is potentially hostile. And here are some examples of these. Let's go to them rather briefly. Cognitive, the mere characterization of people into groups and in groups and out groups in recent days(ph) is sufficient to initiate bias, where you begin to value the people who are now in your group more and you begin to devalue people of members of other groups. What is it that we do to categorize people? We can categorize people instantaneously and automatically based on what we see and what we see in our society is race and sex, not coincidentally forming the basis of two very pervasive forms of bias. Motivational, we have needs. These are power, status and control not simply for ourselves but for our groups, and in a world of limited resources, one of the ways we maintain the power, status, and control of our group is how, it's by resisting the progress of other competing groups, and this too is normal and this was(ph) cross cultural. And socio-cultural, we have to face the fact that America has racist traditions. We're a country founded on proposition that all men were created equal, but it took us 200 years to pass a legislation guaranteeing that Blacks were equal to whites, and that came at great personal and political cost and we were never able to pass an amendment guaranteeing that women were equal to men. So these are all the reasons of why people would be likely to develop biases and these involve normal, functional psychological processes. We then try to develop a list of reasons why people would not be biased. How was it that people become not biased in our society? When we did that, I was struck by two things. First of all, the list was short, okay? By the way, does anyone know what I'm saying when I say short? Ah, I had lunch with Joe Trimble(ph) yesterday. He was been at Harvard for a year. He now thinks I don't have an accent. (laughs) Harvard, Harvard changes you, no doubt about it. So the list is very brief and short, and second of all, in contrast of these fundamental psychological processes, the reasons why people tend not to be bias involved typically locked-in abstract principles such as commitments to fairness, justice and equality, such as religious ideology. So what we have here on one hand is a long list of reasons why people would be likely develop biases, and the reason involved is normal functional psychological processes, we have on the other hand a shorter list of reasons of why people would be not biased and these involve interlocking abstract principles and this changed the way I looked at things quite dramatically. Now when someone comes to me and says to me that have prejudice, that they have biases, I believe them. I can understand the reasons why. No problem. But now when someone comes to me and tell me that they, they have no prejudices whatsoever, they have no biases at all, that to me is a lot more interesting because what they're doing is they're applying to me and perhaps to themselves is that they can overcome this long list of basic psychological processes and rely solely on these abstract principles. What then is the nature of the racial attitudes of people who say they are not prejudiced and who may, to believe they are not prejudiced. We believe there are many of these people are who we call aversive racist, a modern racist, truly endorse the principles of fairness and justice and equality at the conscious level, truly embrace these principles at a conscious level but we also believe that these are normal people; therefore, they're susceptible of these normal processes and they do develop negative feelings and beliefs about Blacks and other people of color but they may not be aware of these feelings; they may try to reject these feelings. They try to dissociate these feelings, but these feelings still exist. So what we have is both positive and negative feelings existing side by side within the same individual, in such that some of the time and a case(ph) of behavioral instability such that some of the time, it's the positive aspect of the attitude that gets expressed and some of the time the negative aspects of the attitude that get expressed. What determines whether it's the positive or negative aspects of the attitude that gets expressed, we believe is the nature of the situation. Now what I want to do today is basically take four principles from this aversive racism framework and try to answer the question why can't we get along? ahm, first of all, this ah, ah, perspective suggest that racism today is much more subtle, indirect and rationalizable than in the past. Second of all, and it's very important to this approach is the roots of this bias may be un, unconscious, and therefore we're talking about unintentional biases. Third of all, Blacks and whites, majority and minority group members, whites and people of color, have different perspectives and in the way they view this subtle racism, and finally, that this subtle racism clearly has differential consequences for whites and people of color. So these are the four things that I'll take you through in terms of the implications. Now what do I mean about the nature if the situation? Basically our framework that guided a lot of the work we've done for many years is this. We believe that modern racists, aversive racists truly believe at a conscious level that they are not prejudiced and truly endorsing egalitarian ideals. Therefore, we believe that modern racist will not discriminate against a black relative to a white person in situations where what's right and wrong is clearly defined. In situations where what's appropriate behavior is clearly defined because to discriminate here would be obvious to other people and to one's self. Modern racists don't want to appear bigoted. They don't want to be bigoted. They want to do right things for Blacks, and they will when they know what it is, no discrimination here. (laughter) What, what we believe is that modern racists do have these negative feelings and beliefs and these negative feeling, feelings and beliefs will automatically be expressed but in subtle, indirect and rationalizable ways. In situations where what's right and wrong is not clearly defined, in situations where what's appropriate behavior is not clearly defined, or in situations where they can rationalize and justify a negative response to a black person but on a basis of some factor other than race. And in that way, you can provide an advantage to the whites, a disadvantage to Blacks but in a way that insulates and protects you from ever having to confront the possibility that your behavior was racially motivated. So in one of our earliest tests of this, ah, that one of the oldest test of this, that we use the Dalian (inaudible ) diffusion responsibility paradigm. We basically brought subjects into the lab and asked, ah, let them believe that they will gonna be the only witness to an emergency, ah, led them to believe that there'd be other people who would witness an emergency that was going to occur. What we varied in the study was the race of the victim. In half the cases, the victims were white, and the other half of the cases, the victim was Black. Subjects were all in the study. What we find here is when subjects of the only witness to the emergency and they bear 100 percent of the responsibility for helping and 100 percent of the guilt and blame for not helping. When the appropriate behavior is clearly defined there's no discrimination against the black victim. They are all helped quite a bit, 85 to 95 percent of the time. In fact, the black victim is helped a little bit more often. No old fashioned racism here where you let somebody suffer and die solely because of their race. But when we change the situation slightly and we give them an excuse not to get involved. And ostensively, non-race-related excuse to believe that someone else could intervene. In this case, the black victim is helped half as often as the white victim. The black victim is helped 37 and a half percent of the time; the white victim is helped 75 percent of the time. In this situation, that Black person would die 62 and a half percent of the time; that white person would die 25 percent of the time. Discrimination occurs systematically against that black person but in a way that people can justify or rationalize on the basis of some factor other than race. If you ask these people why they didn't get involved in that situation, they all gave the same answer, what was it? "I thought somebody else would do it." And they were quick to deny that race had anything to do with their decision, but, we know that race had everything to do with their decision because the only thing that differed between these two conditions was the race of the victim. So, they discriminated in a way that I believe they themselves didn't even recognize, but in a way that was very profound. Although the bias may be subtle, the consequences can be quite significant. Now, we also believe that this operates in terms of more mundane types of biases, such as in selection decisions for jobs or admissions to college, and I'll just give you a couple of examples of that. Ah, in one study we did, basically, what we did is we created a situation where students had to give some input on hiring someone ah, for, a, as a resident advisor at their college, and all we did was we created an applicant, ah, background form where the person was unambiguously qualified for the position; the person clearly surpassed all the criteria. We had another application where the person was unambiguously, ah, poorly qualified, didn't satisfy any of the criteria. And then we had, uhm, a moderately qualified person who arguably could be qualified for the job or, or who arguably could not be qualified for the job. So, we created an ambiguous decision situation based on the quality of the applicant, and then of course all we did was vary the race of the applicant. What we found here is if you look at the unambiguously unqualified applicant, there's no discrimination against the black applicant. In fact, the black applicant is recommended a little bit more strongly. If you look at the unambiguously qualified applicant, there's no bias against the black applicant. In fact, the black applicant is rated slightly better. But, if you look at the applicant who has, ahm, intermediate qualifications, which I would say represents most of the type of selection, ah, decisions that we face, it is in this condition that the black applicant is rated significantly not as good as the white applicant who we know have exactly the same qualifications. When you move into this ambiguous range, the bias occurs. And if you look very carefully at these data, it seems that the ambiguous qualifications for a white person is assumed to be like strong qualifications, whereas the ambiguous qualifications for a Black person is assumed to be weak, and we know objectively that they're the same. Now how do they justify this process? We've done another study where we looked at, ah, we asked people to help us, ah, make admissions decisions to their university and we varied two dimensions of an applicant's qualifications. One would be their SAT scores as being high or low, which we manipulated, and another one was their scholastic high school achievement, which we manipulated as being high or low. So we basically, when you combine this, you have applicants who are very weak, low on SAT scores and low on high school achievement, we have applicants who are very strong, high on both, and then we have two middle categories, ambiguous categories, high on SAT's, low on, on achievement, low on SAT's or high on achievement. When you look at these data, you see the same basic pattern that I got before. If you look at the very fully, the fully qualified applicant, no bias against the Black, in fact, a little bit more favorable. When you look at the well qualified applicant, the unambiguously qualified applicant, no bias against the Black, but if you look at the two intermediate conditions, what you see is the black applicant is supported and recommended significantly less strongly than the white applicant who we know has exactly the same qualifications. This, this effect by the way is a little bit more pronounced for high prejudice and for low prejudice scoring subjects, and you wonder, how can they justify this decision? Well, the way they justify this decision, ahm, it revealed on how they weighed the criteria for college. So, we asked afterwards, "How important are these things in terms of admitting somebody to college?" And the two things we're interested in was SAT scores and high school achievement. Looking very carefully at this, lets just take the two middle conditions. When the black applicant has high college board scores but low achievement, and you ask people to rank, what's more important, what's the most important things of admitting somebody to college, what they say is high school achievement is more important than SAT's. However, when you confront them with the Black applicant who has low college board scores and high achievement, and you ask them, "What's the most important criteria in admitting somebody to college?" it's going to be college board scores. So they shift their criteria in systematic ways that disadvantage the black person, and coincidentally in this study, advantages the white person and so, they can discriminate by justifying it's not race that's the issue, it's what? It's the criteria that the issue and they just don't meet the criteria. Too bad. Okay? Now, what I want to suggest is that you simply take this, I'll give you sort of a, an everyday example of this, if you take this out, it can help you understand, why we can't understand one another. And I'll give you this example, suppose I'm a, ah m, an interviewer. I'm a white interviewer for a job. And I'm interviewing a number of different candidates. They're all very good and it's a very difficult decision for me. And one of these candidates is black, who's very good and a number of these candidates who are white who are also very good and I have to make a decision. Well, I may feel more comfortable with a white person for a variety of reasons, I end up weighing all the different qualifications and say, "You know, what we really need here is somebody with a technical degree, not someone with a liberal arts degree." And so when I'm going to make my decision based on the technical degree. Well, who has a technical degree? It's the person who's white. And who has the liberal arts degree? It's the person who's Black. So I say to the black applicant, "You know, you're really very good but the criteria that's most important here is your, ahm, whether someone has a liberal arts or technical background." Now I walk away from that interaction, from that decision with a clear conscience, coz I can justify and rationalize that behavior on the basis of some factor other than race. I'm not biased. Now that Black applicant now goes for another job, is interviewed by another white interviewer, and again, he's really, she's really very good, and there's a lot of very good white applicants as well, but that second interviewer decides to do what, to hire a white person. And what's the reason? Well, we're really looking for someone who has a lot of sales experience, not someone just out of college. And now who has the sales experience? It's somebody who is white, not the person who is black. Now, that second white interviewer walks away with a totally clear conscience. It has nothing to do with race. It has to do with criteria. And that, that, then that black applicant goes for a third job, gets, doesn't get the job, gets a third explanation. Now, looking at the two perspectives, from the perspective of the white, each white interviewer, it had nothing to do with race. There was no racism in any way, there was no discrimination and certainly I'm not prejudiced. But, what about from the perspective of the person of color? What ties those three experiences together? Is it the technical background? No, that explains one but doesn't explain two. Is it sales experience? No, that explains one, but doesn't explain the other two. Is it the third excuse? No. What ties those experiences together most logically, most rationally, most parsimoniously? That fact is what? I am Black and I didn't get the job and the interviewer was white and the person they hired is white and they did get the job. So, from the perspective of a person of color, it makes most sense to see racism everywhere because you don't know where it is and you can't trust, ah, people. So, you see it everywhere, at least the potential for it everywhere, whereas, the perspective of whites is what, we see it nowhere. And so, you have these very divergent perspectives that we're not aware that each other holds. But, ah, these are not only divergent, but they're contradictory perspectives. Next thing I want to say is, sort of moving on to the next level, is that, what about this bias? Is it really unconscious and can we test that? And we have developed some ways and I'm gonna, just mention briefly some cognitive techniques we've done and then talk about the implications . We find if we ask our subjects, "Are you prejudiced?" 90 percent of them say no. But they are, they score very low on prejudice and on these overt self-report measures is not good at detecting prejudice because none of them are prejudiced. So, what we've done is we've adopted some methods of cognitive psychology and I'll try to summarize this technique very quickly. What we do is we present on our key trials in this method, we present a schematic of a black person and a white person, and we do that because these have to go up and down on the screen in about 16 milliseconds. Because you present the face very rapidly on a screen and then the next thing that occurs, uhm, is a geometric figure that covers the face. And the geometric figure can be an oval with a " P" and subjects are told, "When you see an oval with a "P," we want you to think about a person, or, in the controlled trails, it's a square with an "H", and that means a house, I won't talk anymore about those. So what happens is a schematic face of a Black or white person comes up on the screen and then it immediately gets covered by this oval and subjects are thinking about a person. But what that first face is, is really a subliminal cue. It registers on peoples minds even though they can't report that they've seen it, so it's a subliminal cue. And then we ask them this task. Can this word, the next word you see, ever describe a person, can good ever describe a person? Yes. Can bad ever describe a person? Yes. But, in this test, what we're really looking at the effects of the subliminal cue on how quickly people can make that decision. With the assumption that is, the more associated two things are in a persons mind, the more quickly you can make a decision about those two events. Did that make sense to people? So, good. So, here's what we find. Using the response latency measure, we find the biases there even among the people who say they're not biased whatsoever, that as our subjects associate more pos, ah, positive characters more with the white faces, with the white prime than the black prime, and they associate negative characteristics more with the black prime than the white prime. They're not aware of their biases. They're not aware we're testing the racial attitudes, but we find automatically and unconsciously that these negative feelings and associations linger below the level of consciousness. We also find consistent with aversive racism that there is only a weak relationship between these response or unconscious biases and people say, that is there's a dissociation between what they say, which is typically that their not prejudiced, and the fact that they do have these unconscious biases. So, you have people operating at two levels, the conscious attitudes, which I'll call the explicit attitudes, and the unconscious attitudes that would, which are the implicit attitudes. Now what are the, a, question that always comes up is a, "Which is the person's true attitude?" And it's really seductive(ph) to think that this is their true attitude because they're hiding everything else. What I want to suggest is something different, that both the implicit unconscious attitudes and the explicit attitudes, the self-report attitudes, are legitimate valid aspects of a person's attitude. That is who that person is and they do predict behavior, but they predict, ah, different behaviors. So, when I fill out a self-report prejudice scale, I'm thinking about my responses. I'm deliberating on how I want to appear to other people and to myself and what I'd like to suggest is that if these overt types of attitudes will predict comparable types of behaviors. So, if I am thinking about how I am going to respond on a, a prejudice scale, then that's probably going to be a good predictor of how I'm going to behave in an overt, public way. If I say I'm a racist on a prejudice scale, I'm likely to discriminate in an open way. So these, the, ahm, overt attitudes will map on to the deliberative behavior. But, not all behaviors are deliberative. Some of them occur spontaneously, reflexively without much opportunity for us to control or monitor, such as our non-verbal behaviors. And what we predict is that these non-verbal spontaneous behaviors we predicted better by the implicit attitudes, which are activated unconsciously and uncontrollably and automatically in terms of influencing behavior. Can, you still with me on that? So, to test that out, I'm going to give you just a couple of studies here. To test that out, we basically brought subjects into the laboratory, white subjects, had them fill out a self-report scale and a, a, a priming task to measure their attitudes. And then what we did was we had them, ah, be interviewed by a black or white ah, person, Black and white people. These are confederates of, of, ah, that we use, and then we ha-, measured a kind of an overt form of discrimination. We asked our subjects at the end to evaluate the black interviewer relative to the white interviewer. We have trained to behave in comparable ways. But, we also looked at some spontaneous behaviors. We looked at the non-verbal behaviors, and the two non-verbal behaviors we looked at was how much eye contact the subject had with the confederates as a sign of connection positivity in liking and how much they blinked their eyes, which is a sign of discomfort. ahm, and here's what we found. If you want to look at the overt and critically overt bias of subjects, the best predictor of the overt subjects of bias was the self-report, old-fashioned racism scale. If I say, "I'm biased against Blacks in general, I'm also biased against his particular Black." It was a good predictor of overt forms of discrimination. But, if we want to predict the spontaneous forms of bias, that is differences in eye contact and differences in eye blinking in the non-verbal behaviors, then the better predictor of that, it wasn't the old-fashioned racism, that as my verbal behaviors don't predict my non-verbal behaviors, what predicts these subtle non-verbal behaviors are the implicit unconscious attitudes. Now remember, there, there's another aspect of this. Most of the white subjects we have say they're not prejudiced, so the don't discriminate on the overt level, but they are unconsciously biased so they showed these non-verbal behaviors at a regular level. So, there was this inconsistency between what they say and what they do. So, that's the next thing I want to talk about here, which is because of uhm, ah, that blacks and whites in these interracial interactions have very different perspectives on one another, ah, particular, on the behavior of whites, and this idea of implicit and explicit biases, overt and covert biases, has real implications about the interpretations they form. Basically, if I am interacting with a person of color, I am aware of my conscious attitudes. I can say, "I'm not prejudiced. I'm a nice guy." I can mo-, monitor and control my verbal behavior. I can say all the right things 'coz I can control those behaviors, and if you ask me at the end of this interaction how did things go, how, how friendly did I behave, what will I say? Well, I like Blacks. I said all the right things. Everything is just hunky-dory, okay? But, what about the perspective of, of a person of color. When they're looking at me, they're monitoring not only my verbal behaviors, but they're monitoring how I say it, my non-verbal behaviors, things that I'm not aware of. And the research shows that when you have contradictions between verbal and non-verbal behavior, people pay more attention to the non-verbal behavior. They say there's more diagnostic. Particularly, if you're suspecting that somebody has negative attitudes to you, you're going to be particularly attuned to those negative behaviors. So this research, the different perspective that whites and blacks have can produce very different outcomes in these interactions and let me give you an example as I get down to my last couple of minutes here. We brought people into the laboratory, white subjects interacting with blacks in interracial situations. We measured their unconscious and conscious racial attitudes. We measured how ah, the verbal and non-verbal behavior, we had it coded for friendliness. And then we simply did this: We asked the white subject at the end of this interaction, "How friendly do you think you behaved?" "How friendly did you appear?". And then we also asked to the ah, confederates ah, the, the partners in this case, we asked the partners, "How friendly did the white person appear to you in these inter-racial interactions?" Ah, prediction is, that in a sense the priming task will predict non-verbal behavior and the non-verbal behaviors is what the partners are gonna cue into about the true feelings of the subject. However, the subjects, whites are sort of oblivious to all the non-verbal cues. They can only monitor the controllable unconscious things, and that will be related to their self-reports. I know I got one last against(ph) this I'm all set. That's what we found, that is the implicit attitudes, if I'm implicitly unconsciously biased, that predicts my non-verbal behavior and those non-verbal behaviors predict how friendly I'm perceived by my Black partner. That's what they're keying in on. But, if you ask me about how friendly I fe-, I, I behaved in that situation, I'm gonna fall back on my explicit attitudes, I'm not prejudiced. I'm gonna fall back on those behaviors that I can monitor, my verbal behavior and I was awfully nice and I'm gonna think I did awfully well. Now here's the dilemma. My conscious and unconscious attitudes are basically unrelated to one another. I say I'm not prejudiced and my implicit attitudes indicate a bias. So, that means if you track it all the way through, what's the correlation between the impression that the white person has of his or her behavior and the impression of the Black partner has of his or her behavior. It's essentially unrelated. So, I think I'm doing wonderfully and my Black partner thinks I'm doing terribly. And when we interviewed people, they had no clue that the other person could see it in any way different than them. So you ask the whites, "How did you do?" " I did great." "Do you think, do you think there's a chance that other person didn't think you did great?" "Oh, no. I did great." Okay? And then you say to the Black partner, "How did things go?" "Oh(ph), lousy." Okay? Do you think the person suspects they did lousy? Of course they had to know they did lousy. (laughter) Here's what I'm telling you. They have no clue, okay? (laughter) They are totally clueless. The last idea I'll talk about and we'll get to the end, I promise, is that, you just track this one step further and that not only do we have these different perspectives and these different types of biases, but they really have uhm, it's, it's obvious and logical I, but I, but I want to say it anyway, but they have different consequences in inter-group contact, and because I only have a minute, I'll summarize the study very quickly. What we did in the study was we simply categorized our subjects into three categories, non prejudiced whites, people who say they're not prejudiced and show no implicit bias, which is about 15 percent. Uhm, prejudiced whites who said they were prejudiced and showed implicit biases, which was another of 15 percent of our population ah, that we could classify and then we had aversive racist, people who said they weren't prejudiced on the overt measures but show these implicit biases, these unconscious biases, and this was actually the, you know, about 45 percent of our subjects ah, fell into this particular category, quite a, quite a few ah, though some people we couldn't classify very well. All we did in the study was we brought these three different types of subjects into, interact with Black partners on a problem-solving task. And what we did is, we, we measured the impressions that the white person had of himself or herself, just like we did before. We measured the impressions of the Black person had of the white partner just as we did before and we measured, as a kind of measure of effectiveness, how quickly the, uh, the two groups could perform the task and complete the task as a measure of task performance. And because I'm short on time, I'll take you through this extremely quickly and then, have, to do my conclusions. You know, I asked Derald to, to, Derald to ah, tell me when five minutes was up and then I, I knew I'd turned my back on him. Ah, (laughs) I felt terrible about that. (laughs) I know. So, ah, I apologize. (laughs) But if you look at the three classifications of subjects for a minute, just what I, I thought the same basic pattern occurs. The white subjects are falling back on the explicit attitudes when you asked them questions. So, if you asked the white subject how friendly did they behave, the people who say they're not prejudiced, these two groups, say they behaved in a very friendly manner. And whereas the high prejudice subjects say, "I don't like Blacks. I wasn't that friendly." Okay? If you ask the Black partner, how friendly did the white person behave, the same basic effect that we got before. They're keying in on the implicit attitudes, that is they see the non-prejudiced white as being friendly but they see the aversive racist and the prejudiced people as being less friendly. So, they're able to key in on that. If you look at trustworthiness, all the whites say, "Hey, I'm trustworthy," but Blacks have a very different picture of it. They see as most trustworthy the white person who's not prejudiced. They see the person who's next most trustworthy is who? The ba-, the white person who's, who's prejudiced. They say what they mean, well, they mean what they say. They are trustworthy. (laughs) Now, think about it. And finally, they see as the least trustworthy the aversive racist whose verbal behaviors may be all positive, but whose non-verbal behaviors undermine and belie that. The last thing I wanna show you in this, this thing as we just move over is the time it takes them to solve the problem as a measure of efficiency. And what we see here is the group that is the most efficient, whose performance is the best, is the Black person interacting with a non-prejudiced white. They solved it in four and a half minutes. What's the group that stays second most? It is the Black person working with a high-prejudiced white. There's some baggage there but is pretty much out in the open. But the group that's the least efficient is a Black person interacting with an aversive racist because they're dancing around. There's inconsistency. Nobody knows what's going on but they have to work through these inconsistencies and it takes them longest to solve the problem. I mean this also raised to something that Claude mentioned, is that these non-verbal cues can also be the types of things that elicit, you know, the cues about whether people are being seen as members of their category and it can have, expect the, the effects that you were talking about. The last thing I wanna say about this in terms of its implications then I'll do a thirty-second conclusion and leave it for questions is this and it's a simple thing of mathematics. In American societies, American companies that are largely white, these types of biases have very ah, different ah, impacts on Blacks and whites. Allow me to explain. If you have a company that's about 90 percent white, then 90 percent of the time, whites are gonna be interacting with whites and they're gonna be solving the problem in four and a half minutes because there's no racial baggage to deal with. So, if you average the performance of the white person, it's gonna be four and a half minutes. What about the performance of the black person? Ninety percent of the time, they're gonna be interacting with who? Whites. And what kind of whites? These kinds of whites. So if you average their performance, because they are part of this process, their performance is gonna be in the range of five and a half to six minutes because they have to deal with the racial attitudes of whites, and it ah, reflects upon their performance. So at the end of the day, at the end of the year when you evaluated the performance of these groups of people, who do you evaluate more highly? Who do you promote? What does the objective evidence say? The objective evidence says, "These whites can solve the problem in four and a half minutes. These blacks are gonna take six minutes to solve the problem. This is objective. There's no bias here, so we promote the whites and not the blacks and you have disparate outcomes not because of intentionality, but because it, it infects, the racism infects the process as well as the outcome and, and because people don't see it affecting the process, because whites don't see it affecting the process, they assume it's not there. And here are my conclusions. Uhm, bias today is often subtle and unconscious and I wanna point out though that even though it's subtle, its consequences can be very significant. But because it's subtle, because it's unintentional, because it's not overt, because it's implicit, most whites deny its existence while Blacks can see its existence very clearly, so it produces very different perspectives but it also produces a situation of miscommunication. Because Blacks often see the bias there and it's so obvious to them, what they assume is it's intentional. And so, when they say, "You meant to treat me this way," the response of an aversive racist will truly and honestly be, "I didn't intend to do it." So, the argument of intent really distracts people from the issue because we get into an argument. "You intended it." "No, I didn't." "You intended it." "No, I didn't." You sound like my kids, you know? That's what it sounds like and you can't win that argument. But what's happening is the bias can occur unintentionally by seeping into the process, by changing the way we, we deal with one another. And because we have two different perspective, two different views, and we're unaware that the other group has a different view than us, we cannot communicate, we cannot understand one another, we cannot trust one another. And until we can make each other aware, not only that each of us has a different perspective but both perspectives are logical and valid and reasonable, but both probably a little bit wrong, we can't move forward to understanding one another and building a really constructive dialogue with one another. And I'll stop there. Thank you.

JOHN F. DOVIDIO (inaudible ) 

01:25:48
LISA PORCHE BURKE  We wanted to have a little time for you to ask some questions of our, our very eloquent speakers so, uhm, there are microphones uhm, located uhm, in each of these aisles and I'll open the floor for questions. 

01:26:05
UNKNOWN  I have a, I have a question for Dr. Dovidio. Uhm, so you basically are implying with your research that it's a good idea not to ah, name the race in the, in college applications? 

01:26:20
JOHN F. DOVIDIO Uhm, depending on how well qualified you are. Uhm, I mean, I think that the problem is the subtle biases ah, do, in fact, slip in. And I think that, I will say that one of the things about this idea of aversive racism in this, the, on the plus side, is if you can make it very clear uhm, present information about race and make it very clear that it's about race, uhm, that aversive racists are really motivated to do the right thing that truly motivate it not to be bias. So, I think, (crosstalk) 

01:26:50
UNKNOWN Ahh. 

01:26:50
JOHN F. DOVIDIO ..in cases where they are accountable... (crosstalk) 

01:26:50
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

01:26:50
JOHN F. DOVIDIO ...and monitored and the outcome, your qualifications, the decisions should be clear, it can brought(ph) to your advantage. But in the cases where there's any ambiguity uhm, I think race becomes ah, a, something that you really have to worry about. Uhm. 

01:27:05
UNKNOWN Hmm. Okay, thanks. 

01:27:05
UNKNOWN  Uhm, this is for ah, Dr. Steele. Uhm, you said that you, if you use high standards but affirm a student's ability to meet the standards that that can help to overcome stereotype threat. I'm wondering and, and basically so you increase the motivation of the student and then you ah, ah, you negate the, the threat. Does this work with the rear, what you call the rearguard students? Because I'm very concerned about those students in my college. Uhm, the ones who are less motivated who are not like gung ho about education. Uhm, does that work for them and, and how do you, you know? 

01:27:45
CLAUDE M. STEELE Uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:27:45
UNKNOWN 'Coz it's like, seems like there are two levels. 

01:27:45
CLAUDE M. STEELE yes, that's, that's a good question. Is this on? Yeah. Uhm, and I, I would, I, I would say that it probably, it, it was done, the research testing, it was done with students who are very strong and very identified so the results are clearest ah, there and I, I, that, that should be understood. However, I do think that with regards to, to students who are seen in the rearguard that oftentimes challenge of that sort is more motivating than ah, other, ah, types of, of response to that kind of students so, ah, I, and, and I think that ah, the recognition of potential, even in the face of relatively poor performance on the part of the student that, that when a student feels that somebody in the ah, adult world so the socializing world ah, see some potential there then that, combined with really challenging that potential, can be an ingredient that I think would be generally useful. So, I think that would help, I, I mean I, I would like to, I, I would like to have the data that, that already shows that. (Laughs) Ah, but I would extrapolate to that, I would extrapolate to that idea. 

01:28:50
UNKNOWN I have a question. Is it on? I don't think it, it is on. Uhm, I have two questions, one for each speaker. One, is if assuming you believe in the ah, necessary evil of intellectual testing, big assumption, I'm wondering, Dr. Steele, what results you might expect if uhm, Black examiners examine Black children and if the instructions were given in the two different conditions that you suggest? I mean, it might have real clinical implications. 

01:29:25
CLAUDE M. STEELE  Ah, I, I think it's difficult to do what we do in the laboratory at home, so to speak, that is, (laughs) ah, it's difficult to, just to, in a real high stakes testing situation to have the kind of mo, most of the instructions that, that we use, for example, the test doesn't show gender differences or the test show, is racially fair or so on. You can see ah, might arouse more suspicion than the real testing. If someone is really sitting down to take the SAT or they're take(ph), now they're sitting down to take the high school graduation test. Uhm, I, I'm not sure we can in, in, in that context have the same power with these instructions. And I'm really very interested in, in trying to think out, I, I've been in conversation with ETS(ph) about this. Is there some way to, to do some of what we do in the laboratory in, in the real world? (crosstalk) 

01:30:20
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

01:30:20
CLAUDE M. STEELE Ah, but I think it's gonna be difficult because I think that the high stakes of a test would, that the higher the stakes get the, the more severe this kind of pressure gets and, and ah, the, the littler, the, the things that we do, I, I wouldn't expect to be quite as, as a, as impactful. There are other things, you know, maybe testing shouldn't be, you know, that the, is one day for a period of hours; one sitting you come in, you take a test, it's gonna have an impact on the rest of you life. Ah, that, why is that really the only way we can do this? There maybe other ways that we can, can get some of the, that, that we can test people, than, than to, than to create these situations that are just high, high stake situations. 

01:31:00
UNKNOWN Hmm, and Dr. Davidio my quick question is I have a client right now that I'm working with, whose alleging racial ha, harassment, and I was wondering about the implications of your findings for suits of racial and sexual harassment and, and being able to prove a, ah, systemic, systematic uhm, level of discrimination within the organizations. 

01:31:25
JOHN F. DOVIDIO Yeah, I mean, I, I, I mean I think it is directly relevant and I think that you, you had, you, it's hard(ph) in the court of law to talk about a system that's biased. Uhm, they're really looking for, for blame. The, the other thing that's tricky about the aversive racism framework uhm, and trying to, to work this out ah, and ah, can take too long. But there's a case that I had where I was, an expert (inaudible ) coming in a Black male and a White male performance was uhm, the performance records were not good. They were both put on probation. Uhm, what happened is they both performed exactly the same way on probation by all the objective measures that we had. And at the end of the probationary period the White person was given his job back and the Black person was fired. So I thought, you know, this is, like, the, this is great, this is, is (inaudible ) cases I've ever seen. It turns out the argument of the defense was that the Black person was treated fairly. That is by all the criteria that the company had the Black person should be fired. The White person should've been fired too. But they decided to give him a break. And there's no rule, there's no law that said you can't give somebody a break. You can just not discriminate against somebody. And so what happened is the outcome was exactly the same and the case was settled out of court uhm, but basically the, the, the Black defendant lost in that case. Life is not fair. 

01:32:50
LISA PORCHE BURKE And on that note, uhm, we're we're going to have to ah, cease the questions but I wanna encourage you all to uhm, catch these two gentlemen. But don't leave yet, don't leave yet. Uhm, we wanna present these two ah, scholars uhm, provocateurs and wonderful men with the Dalmas A. Taylor Award for light that shines eternally taking on the challenge of change. We're presenting to Claude M. Steele and John Dovidio, in honor of your pioneering leaderships, scholarship, and aggressive advocacy for the inclusion of persons of color in the central fabric of the mission of higher education and within the field of Psychology. Thank you so much. Please join me in really, really acknowledging their.
