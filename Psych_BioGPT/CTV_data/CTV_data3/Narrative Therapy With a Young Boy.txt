DAVID EPSTON I'd welcome you to - watching this video tape and before you do, I'd like to introduce you to myself. I'm David Epston and of course my co-conservationist on this tape, Dr. Sture Djerf and Sebastian then aged 12. Before I introduce you to what led me to have this conversation. I'd like to introduce you to Sture Djerf first. Until recently, Sture was the Director of the Child Guidance Services in Boras, Sweden. Boras is a city of 70,000 and the service provides inpatient, outpatient services for a population of a quarter of a million people. This meeting took place about eight years ago almost to the day. And I had been invited to teach for this services by Sture and his colleagues, and by the end of the second day, I was feeling and I'm -- no, that's right I was approached by an enthusiastic group to see if I would be willing to consult with Sebastian. By now I felt pretty much at home with my colleagues and I consented to do this. Sebastian's mother and stepfather were invited along with his young sisters, but they were unable to attend on such short notice and the fact that they lived about a 100 miles to the north. The reason it was tape was on their behalf. The -- before I met, I talked with Sture, and all the hospital staff, who had known Sebastian and that was 20 or plus people, all of whom then joined us, they were in another room served by a closed-circuit TV. And everyone when they talked about Sebastian, was so desperately concerned about him and for him and I'll tell you the nature of their concerns a little later. But whenever I look towards Sture, I detected a faint sweet nature smile across his face whenever Sebastian's name came up. And whenever I asked questions of him about Sebastian, he would often use the word special, a word that I must say I have adopted ever since that he was a special. We'll find more about how special he is and was as we go along. At the same time, I was aware that Sebastian had been confined to this hospital and had been there for, I believe, a year on the day of my arrival from Stockholm. And he had been -- oh yes, he had caused a great deal of concern to his school teachers, classmates and school administration in relationship to his violent outbursts and several premeditated attempts to grout some classmates. I think I remember being told that if there hadn't been active intervention, he might have been successful. The other thing that probably is important for you to know, I guess it was more like what was important for me to know and what I remember from this half hour long discussion before the video tape that you will see was that Sebastian's father had been brutally violent to his mother and she had left him when Sebastian was aged one and then remarried a very kindly man who I later met called Elpo who joined this family about a year later. But in July of 1992, this is June 1993, Elpo and Karina had triplets. The births were not without complications. However, sadly on January 1993 one of the triplets died of sudden infant death syndrome and you'll hear mention of that in the tape. Stranger that it may sound I -- my recollections of this conversation are that of being one of the most uplifting conversations I have ever had and I doubt if I'll ever forget this conversation to the day I die despite the fact that when I really consider it, if the equation that I read recently stands hierarchies of power are replicated in hierarchies of knowledge. I think you will see that this really compromises that point of view in that, there was a 12 year old young man, confined to this hospital, not free, I know his mother has signed papers for that, but he is not a free person. And Sture, a man of great kindness who bears this moral responsibility very lightly on his shoulders as you'll see, stands as a man empowered to confine him. And I too add a fair ingredient of power in that this maybe something like the reverse of the Lourdes effect. You may not know what the Lourdes effect is. The Lourdes effect goes something like this, no one in Lourdes ever got the cure. The further you travel to Lourdes the more likely you are to get a cure, but I think traveling consultants can -- can be considered by the same rule of sum, coz I had traveled from a country that borders with Antarctica to a country that includes the Arctic Circle, and I had traveled 36 hours from door to door from Auckland to Stockholm. So, I think I had that going for me. There are few other points I would like to make just before we turn the -- start the video. One is some comments that Sture made about the running away. I need to explain and give you a little bit of context for that. The running away referred to a meeting the day of my arrival, when Sture had instituted at his - in his service a practice, whereby whenever young people's lives were being decided upon, he introduced the idea that there should be a witness to that. And on this occasion, it was Sebastian's case conference, I guess it could have been called, I don't know what name they would have used, was the first instance of that. However, Sebastian was watching it from behind a - the meeting of professional speakers with Sebastian who -- with Sture who was keeping his company -- him company. Apparently at some point in this discussion Sebastian stood up said two words in English, which are well known and then we turned to his native language and said I'm out of here and he ran away and Sture ran after him, they had fight and embroiled, and Sebastian decided to return to witness the rest of this conversation. You will hear that referred to as the running after. Another thing that I -- a comment I'd like to make about this tape is that the circumstances. This is by no means a first interview. To me this interview was a last interview for me and a last interview for my, you know, everyone's hopes for Sebastian in the sense that his violence had been increasing substantially and I would find it hard to believe that such violence towards staff could be sustained for ever I don't -- I didn't -- I wondered if he would be able to be sustained in such a caring and therapeutic environment. And the other thing that is important to know that more recently he had, I think the week before he -- a large knife had been seized from him and he -- his preference for dressing as Rambo was becoming more and more pronounced. One story sticks in mind that I went into this interview with and that was a story that dates back to his second or third year of life. When Elpo in jest made a physical gesture one of well intention towards his partner Karina, and when Sebastian witnessed this, I guess assuming that harm was being done he attacked Elpo and there was -- it took quite a while to disengage him from Elpo. Another thing that struck my mind was the care and fierce protective he had for his little sisters, which was a well known in the interview. I spent quite a bit of time thinking about the first question in this –- on this -- in this interview. And it's a very important question for me, and it's one that I was glad to ask Sebastian seven years later what -- how he remembers it and he remembered it very well and I'll tell you later what he had to say about it. But it has led to a study and a restudy of a practice that I most currently are calling, I'm sure I could think of another name tomorrow or the next day, but respectful welcoming; an attempt to reconsider the actual order and conventions of an interview. I won't have too much time to talk to it, but I want you to pay attention to the first question that I ask Sebastian. My only regret is that you can't see the look on his face, a look of absolute shock as he rockets forward in his chair and then reels back saying oye, oye, oye, is which probably needs no translation. I also do want you to know that in preparation for asking this question, I asked Sture this in the conference with the staff and himself before hand, I asked him this I'm going to ask you a question I want you to know that the answer to it is not confidential, answer -- please answer knowing that this the question is not confidential. I think I'll stop there and oh! One more point -- one more point, given that the circumstances were desperate, given that time was limited, given that I thought I would never see that I was on my way to Norway the next day and never see anybody in this room ever again, there is a speed and repeatedly in this work that I guess metaphorically could be considered of going from first gear to overdrive, and I'm aware that I'm leaving out quite a few of the steps. But from my point of view, it was a race against time and such repeatedly certainly warranted by the circumstances. So what I've done to assist you with this is provided a transcript so that you can go back and at least watch the steps. But a lot of the intermediate steps that might have happened in a more meeting that didn't have this degree of urgency, I think, are absent and I apologize for them not being there. But I hope you'll agree that, you know, the circumstances warranted the measures that I introduced in this particular session. The questions that I would like you to entertain in watching this probably, you know, are twofold. One set of questions has to do with the matter of the nature of this conversation and how such a power laden conversation turns out to look like a bunch of, uh, age mates sharing their thoughts. And if anything Sebastian, takes the lead in this conversation. And secondly the point at which Sebastian takes over the interview and enters the imaginary with his relationship -- his punitive relationship with his admired soccer player. And I urge you just listen to the sound of his voice, the urgency in which he speaks in, the creativity in which he brings forth his knowledge in relationship to a concern that we all share. So number one, how did we convene a meeting between ostensibly jailers and a prisoner to as he says that we talked like comrades. And secondly, how did this conversation enroll Sebastian in his knowledge's rather than as it so often the case subjecting young people to the knowledges of their elders. Thank you.

DAVID EPSTON The tape you just saw was in late June 1993. Instead of the conventional follow-up, I'm going to read you some correspondence between myself and Sture. This is a fax with the conventions of sending fax, but I'm going to read it to you. This was sent in August. Sebastian, I met him twice in June. At our first meeting after your session, he told me that he had all the time since he was about three to four years old, thought that he had to be a bad guy, because that was the only way to make an impression and frighten all grown up people like his real father, who as you remember was something like an alcoholic and criminal man. When I recognized that he had been studying the techniques of being a bad guy in such a clever way, we talked about Sebastian as a clever pupil. The question then came up, if he didn't have to study the techniques of being a bad guy in such a clever way, did he think he could still go on studying, but now with another goal on his mind, and that was to create a good future for himself. He very clearly answered yes. I then met him another time with his mother, stepfather, and two sisters to look your tape. Sebastian was very pleased with this situation and his parents liked very much what they saw. When I met him in August, he really convinced me that he had changed and that the bad guy had disappeared out of his life. You remember the all planning that he should remain an in-patient another year and then attend our small school here as an outpatient? Well, he and his mother were able to convince the school about his change of behavior and he has started in his ordinary school one week ago. So far it's turned out very good and I'm going to meet him three weeks. He also wanted me to send you his kind regards. I replied, "Dear Sebastian, Dr. Djerf wrote meet to tell me -- wrote to tell me the bad guy had disappear out of your life since we met. That is great news. For me, that is better news in finding out New Zealand beat Sweden in soccer, not that that is very likely. From the moment I met you, I believed you could be the good guy you were. Isn't it great that you are now going to an ordinary school or do you think it is too soon for that? That your good guy hasn't had enough practice yet to take on ordinary school. Guess what I'm hoping? That you aren't ready to take your good guy to ordinary school or that you are ready to take your good guy to ordinary school. Sebastian, do mind me asking you a few questions? Because I meet quite a few young people here in New Zealand who have got into being bad guys thinking that was a good thing for them to do. They find it might work for a while and then they get into serious trouble, and is it okay if I tell them what you tell me? Please let me know. One, how hard was it for you to disappear your bad guy? Do you miss your bad guy? Are you finding your good guy is making new more friends? Are you finding your good guy is making you closer to your mother, your stepfather and your sisters? Are you finding your good guy allows your more happiness and fun? Did it help to evolve your sisters both living in dead in your heart? Did it help through your mom and stepfather to see the video tape in which you decided to have a good guy life? And are there any other things you would like to tell young people in New Zealand who thought they should be bad guys? I'd look forward to hearing from you and learning from you. Yours truly, David." Three months later, Sture replied. "As I told you the work together with Sebastian moves on in a -- in a nice way. At first he didn't want to answer your questions, but very soon, I could bring them into our conversation. And I'll also promise to write them down in my letter to you. One, he says it was easy to disappear his bad guy and of course he don't miss his bad guy. Yes, he makes new friends, especially at school. The good guy is making him closer to his mother, stepfather and sisters. Yes, the good guy allows his more happiness and fun. It was difficult at first for Sebastian to tell if his live and dead sisters helped in the way -- in that way, but when we went on talking, he thought that was the case. Yes, he thinks that his parents enjoyed to look at the video and that it help them to trust even more in him. He answers that you have to decide yourself if you want to change and then it was very easy." Sebastian was discharged from all contact with the psychiatric service four months after this videotape after eight more meetings following the tape you've seen with Sture. However, 16 months later I return to Boras to take up where I left off with the narrative training in their service, and I requested Sture that he invite Sebastian and his parents to meet with me, which we did, they willingly happily did that despite the fact that they had no connection with the service. Once again, I invited all those staff who knew him and attended that meeting to join us when he did. I'll just tell you that mood of that meeting that which struck me so strongly, was sort of like all friends reminiscing about old times. However, there were a few things that stick out from this conversation that I'd like you to know about. One was this question which I asked Sebastian. I said to him, "Is there anyone in this -- now that you'll never be back here again to the hospital, is there anyone who that you -- in this room or behind the video camera, who you would like to thank?" He immediately pointed his finger at Sture and said, "Him." And I asked him why, what his thanks were? And I know that this isn't translation, but this is what he -- the trans – Sture's translation was, "Everyone should learn from him. He never looked down at me, he was my comrade," which of course we can translate to comrade. The other comment that I remember once again in translation, I asked Karina, what struck her about watching the video and she said in translation, "Before watching the video, I thought that the problem was -- would prevail over Sebastian, but once I saw the video, I knew that he could and would prevail over the problem." Seven years later, I got a -- I've always kept in touch with Sture, got an email from him, you can see that we've changed technology. And he said that he was walking down the street in his city, and he met Sebastian by chance, they talked and caught up, and Sebastian said to him that he remembered the tape really when he can't get -- he couldn't get the questions out of his head, seven years later. It so happens soon after that I was invited to give the preliminary address that they will congress of family therapy in Oslo and this gave me the opportunity to return and also to -- it was the matter I was asked to address was the voices of young people, it seemed pretty hard for me to do that, but it gave me the idea, the rationale and the cause to return to Scandinavia once again and I asked if I could meet with Sebastian and he happily agreed. And we -- ones we met once again back in the same hospital, this time over coffee and pastry. And we talked about presenting this tape before the congress, he was very excited about that prospect and it was a little -- it was daunting for me to present in front of 1,700 people. So I didn't think it was fare to ask him. But we asked that if he would like word -- his words to go to this. I won't -- we -- what -- he would -- how we agreed to do this it was we watched the video whenever here anything he wish to say, he'd say stop the video. And I was interested in two things I remember so clearly from this. One was when after the first question that I asked you attend to, he said "Stop the video." He then said translation, "Look, I want to tell you guys something. To this day, I trust no one. I do not trust people, but I want you to know that when you ask that question David, I knew I could trust you." The next comment was that was so striking for me and I'd like you to know about, coz it has bearing on the subtitle of this video, which was when I asked him his -- no, if -- if his sisters were in his heart, he said "Stop the video". He said, "I want you to know that was the very sad time for me, but I feel that the death of my sister, though it was hard to bare at the time, it was very important for me and made me very strong. And also I want you know that I haven't been an angel in the last seven years", and he did mention some deletes, which I must say weren't that far off my own recollections of my same years. But he said, "I want you know that my new born daughter Hannah, who was three months at this time, I believe, she is now in my heart, and I will never do any of those things again, because I do not want her to be humiliated in the way that I was humiliated by my father." At the end of the tape, he turned to us and said to Sture and myself, "Do you think that you could sell this tape for me to raise money for my daughter's education?", and we turned to each other, thought that was a wonderful idea, something we hadn't thought about. And I know it's a long and winding path, but that's how I come to be sitting here today, thanks to Jennifer and your hard work with these videos, and Jimmy, your camera presenting here. And that's the title -- the subtitle of this tape, Hannah Is In My Heart Now. Thank you.
