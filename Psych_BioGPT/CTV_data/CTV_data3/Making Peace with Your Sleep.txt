ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember, the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in your trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do their best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is making peace with your sleep. After trauma many people struggle with claiming(ph) irregular sleep pattern. It might be difficult to fall asleep or you might wakeup through the night after disturbing dream and then can't get back to sleep after that or maybe you wake up early in the morning, leaving you feeling tired for the whole day. Whatever the struggle, there are several things to put in place to make things work better. We need to start with the basics of sleep hygiene and then I want to talk to you briefly about what to do when you wake up in the middle of the night or you simply cannot fall asleep at any time. Let's practice this together. Sleep hygiene basic steps, one, remove television, laptop, smart phones, iPads from the bedroom, basically no low bright screens one hour prior to sleep. Two, do not nap during the day. Three, regulate your sleep wake schedule. This is gonna be difficult to start with. You really want to have the same time to sleep and the same time to wake. So this is gonna be day three if you are pretty tired when you are starting that, but it gets better over time. Four, no caffeine after 1 pm. Five, no heavy meals, three hours prior to bed time. Six, exercise daily. Seven, if something is bothering you, write out your thoughts and solutions during the day well before you go to bed. Eight, ensure the room is dark, quite and comfortable. Nine, a cool room is easier to sleep in. What if you can't get to sleep or you are having nightmares, if you waken and cannot fall asleep, work on deep breathing or relaxation exercises. If after 15 minutes or 20 minutes of this you still cannot fall asleep, get out of bed and do some rewriting the end exercises for dreams or worries or anxieties or fear and go back to bed, for more deep breathing and relaxation. Can't get to sleep or having nightmares? Follow these steps. One, write out the dream content or anxious feelings and rewrite the ending for a positive outcome. Then try to return to sleep. Two, work on any of the deep breathing, relaxation exercises that you found to be helpful in the daily practice of the Trauma Treatment Online Program and three, if you can focus on your breathing and remind yourself that you are safe and can harness calm, it will help the body and mind to find rest even if you are not able to sleep. Practice this whenever you need help with your sleep. Keep a copy of sleep practice by your bed as a reminder. You'll find a copy in the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Practice whenever you need to recaptured feelings of comfort or calm. Take the time right now to form a new healthy practice habit. Take a step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky, from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
