00:00:00
ALLEN IVEY  Dr. John Ratey is one of the most outstanding psychiatrist and neuroscientist in the nation. Ah, I think what impresses me most is his scholarship and his ability to maintain his feet on the ground and direct clinical practice I and he has an immense amount to say to us and for us. Since 2001, each year he's been named one of the best doctors in America. I think that is on Law about the psychiatrist and it's importance. One thing that really impresses me about John Ratey, you think about a psychiatrist, as oriented to -- solely to meds and lets not bother with the environment, lets not bother with social conditions. This is a psychiatrist that really speaks effectively to the broad human condition. You'll see -- you'll hear him talk about the sociobrain, the connection of the person to the environment, what we learn through developmental history. The incredible mind in terms of this knowledge. I have really enjoyed his book, A Users Guide To The Brain. I've read it twice now. I would be going to the main points of that book as it provides such a wonderful basic foundation for our understanding of the importance of neuroscience in counseling and psychotherapy. I rece -- moved in to the reading and study of neuroscience about three years ago and I found him particularly helpful and I realize now that if counseling and therapy are going to survive, all of us are going to have to learn much more about brain functioning . One of the great reassuring parts about this is most of neuroscience says what counseling and therapist have been doing from the very beginning is correct. We are lucky to have a brilliant person such as Dr. John Ratey share his ideas with us. And I'm also going to give him a (inaudible ) as we will occasionally throughout the tape. He's got a new book coming called (ph) Spark which is going to make a real national impact. So here is our chance to listen and learn with Dr. John Ratey. 

00:02:40
Chapter 1: Dr. Rateys Background and Using Neuroscience in Counseling and Therapy Practice 

00:02:40
ALLEN IVEY  Dr. Ratey, it's a real honor to be with you today as not everyday I get to talk to and learn from a person who has been awarded "Best Doctor in America". 

00:03:05
DR. JOHN RATEY (Laughing) (inaudible ). 

00:03:07
ALLEN IVEY And to work with a psychiatrist at that level and to present you to the counseling and therapy field, I feel very -- very lucky today. So I'm, I'm really delighted to be here. I have --as you know a whole stack of questions and issues for you. Ahh, I think, the really interesting place to start though is that you've gone through an interesting journey. You started out psychoanalytically oriented and gradually moved. If, you could tell us a little about that history, going from the psychoanalytical approach to therapy to where you are now. 

00:03:35
DR. JOHN RATEY Well, I had started at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center under the influence of Alvin Semeraud and all in the Lasting(ph) Havens, and the whole bus in psychoanalytic school which co-existed with the biologist and I started my own psychoanalysis in medical school after being introduced to it at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center and then continued because back in the day when I was in training, everyone was in either psychoanalysis or barely intensive psychotherapy. And the highest form of being a psychiatrist was being a psychoanalyst back in the 70s. This -- many of the people that I worked with were both doing research in psychopharmacology or actual neuroscience but had a very deep interest in ahh, psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. Then I began to -- I started off as being the Assistant Director of the training program at Massachusetts Mental Health Center for the residents and the Harvard medical students for about 10 years in which I taught psychotherapy, taught interviewing at the same time- 

00:04:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:04:50
DR. JOHN RATEY  Ah, serendipituosly(ph) discovering stuff about the effect of, first the beta-blockers on aggression. So I spent 10 years really researching aggressive behaviors and writing about that in a variety of different diagnostic categories. Ahh, at the same time having practice, since seeing patients in psychotherapy and out of that groom I had interest in attention deficit disorder and out of that really moved me into being much more interested in the brain and how the brain works and influences personality in our lives. 

00:05:30
ALLEN IVEY And so it's a gradual evolution. I've been one -- of the reason I wanted to interview you is that I think that you do the cutting edge work and as a cutting edge feel which counseling and therapy needs to know a lot more about, ahh, my own feeling is that unless we get with the program eventually we are going to be obsolete. So I see this is a really important way to share the basics, some early basics with the counseling and therapy field. My first question really is how do you use -- how does a psychiatrist use neuroscience in actual practice? 

00:06:05
DR. JOHN RATEY Well, I think you think of what the way I do it and I know that every psychotherapist, psychiatrist uses neuroscience so that they use more diagnosis in using psychopharmacology. And from that angle, you're trying to influence systems from my viewpoint. And you try to manipulate the very systems that are, that you might be aware of in the brain to make them run a little better, or tone them down, tone them up. Ahh, and that's based really on the empiricism and some experimental evidence, ahh. So you try to understand what's not happening in the brain as well as it needs to be or interfering with- (crosstalk) 

00:06:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:06:55
DR. JOHN RATEY -the development of the way the person approaches life or their response time or their attention system, etcetera. 

00:07:05
ALLEN IVEY And so within that, ahh, attention system and understanding, ahh, do you believe that meds are the final answer or do you think that talk therapy can also produce changes? 

00:07:20
DR. JOHN RATEY Well I think there is -- I think what we've, what we've come to today is that it's, it's got to be both, especially the more serious disorders. That the bottom, up and top down approach which, I'd -- I'm falling in love with. The bottom up approach is, is really, ahh using medication or other physical interventions to really affect more of the (inaudible [00:07:51.021]) structures and the systems that are more automatic and more primitive. And then we have the top down approach- (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:55
DR. JOHN RATEY - which is, ahh, kind of behavior trainings, psychotherapy, ahh, planning, coaching ahh, the patient to begin to relearn or learn other options in response to ahh, the world and the problems that they've been having in the past. 

00:08:15
ALLEN IVEY One thing that has taken me about your work is your systems model, your four-part systems model. And where a lot of people think about psychiatry in as being strictly just meds, your four-part model I think is a really a great way that all of us need to think about thing, could you describe that? 

00:08:35
DR. JOHN RATEY Yes, I think one of the big things when I wrote this book over about five, six-year period of time code I use has got to the brain after I really got interested in attention deficit disorder and realized how important the brain was in producing attention and maintaining it etcetera, and was aware of how little we knew, I knew about the brain even though I have been steeped in neuro -- neurology and neurosurgery and had been kept up in psychopharmacology and developments. I knew a lot about that but I knew very little about the brain and in the late 90s, ahh, I was the Director of Medfield State Hospital, as one of the things I was doing and at State hospital system where I did some of my research and teaching and people were beginning to talk about rehabbing the brain. Well it was all very apparent to me that I probably knew more about the brain than most of my colleagues, ahh, and I didn't know much so I became very interested in learning about the brain from the bottom up and then writing about our ending up and my book is used as guide to the brain. 

00:10:00
Chapter 2: Theatre One: Perception Brain Basics: Vision, Hearing, Touch, Taste, and Smell Perceptual Systems 

00:10:00
DR. JOHN RATEY  Because I knew this was where we were moving towards and for me it was ahh, ahh, I was really spending a good five to six years reading everything I could about the various parts of the brain and how it worked and realizing for instance in the my four theaters (ph) of the brain, I talk a lot about the perception aspect that taking information in is, is often something that's very overlooked in clinical practice and this can be a tremendous, ahh, problem for people. Certainly we knew this and we're learning it. In dyslexia research where the sounds are different or not a being fully appreciated or the visual cues are off (ph) some and this lead to sort of a whole deep unders -- investigation in my beginning to understand that this was very important, because this is our first entry of information coming into the world. 

00:11:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:11:25
DR. JOHN RATEY - -- coming in to us from the world. And if it's distorted and if it's not, ah, ah processed correctly then and if it is not coming in correctly, to be processed even then you have to add that into your thinking process. And that happens time and time again with me and talking to patients and finding out that they -- well for instance, they might be reading a little slower than -- than their fellows even though they think that they're smarter or as smart as, and but they're -- they have a problem really in taking material in. 

00:12:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:12:05
DR. JOHN RATEY -ahh, quick enough and dealing with it and just identifying that sometimes can be very relieving, ah, and heuristic for the patient to understand that they're really not as -- they're not slow, or they're not stupid, or they don't have this conflict where they know they should be doing more but they can't because they are being held by these perceptual difference. 

00:12:35
ALLEN IVEY Dr. Ratey, perceptions and area, ah that we've seen as peripheral and unimportant in counseling and psychotherapy and yet I am fascinated by the idea that you come up with that first and I've -- as I read your book myself , I'd move now in two years of study and I said, well I got four years more years to go to get those important six years in. I've become increasingly convinced, cause each of these perceptions, that's where the data enters our brains, smell, taste, touch, sight, vision, and I think that counsels and psychotherapists gives in -- insufficient attention. Now, ah just to elaborate, as I look at it, it seems to me that the most accurate and basic data you can get or maybe the most inaccurate and basic data you get is, What is the information the client is taking in? And that assessment of how they perceive things, I think is really missing. Ahh, we do some of that in my developmental counseling in psychotherapy, where we do focus on what we call sensory motor cognitions and emotions as basic. And I wonder if you can just describe just a little bit about the senses in as the perceptions -- perceptional senses and how they relate to data coming in, the specific parts of the brain for example. 

00:13:50
Sensory data processed early, then integrated with other systems. 

00:13:50
DR. JOHN RATEY Well, they're all -- it's, it's much more intricate than we- 

00:13:55
ALLEN IVEY Can say. 

00:13:55
DR. JOHN RATEY - would assume, ah especially the, the sort of later senses like visual -- vision and auditory sense. They come in and they have a multitude of way stations before they hit the cortex, which is where we process and it there and try to put it all together and is along that chain where you see a lot of problems that might occur, that might affect, ahh, basic input of the very important visual or auditory information. But the other senses except for smell, which is the direct link from our nose into our medulla(ph) and the cortex itself, , ahh, it's a very most the primitives of our senses and it doesn't get preprocessed that duo(ph) and so it, it has a powerful influences for those of us who smell a lot or as some people can do it, some people don't, some people are infected by it and some people aren't depending on their, ahh own sensory mater -- you know, sensory gifts or, or problems. One of the interesting senses is taste. Because it, it gets processed (inaudible ) taste buds up to into certain parts of our brain and it's linked with something that in area the brain that's getting much more attention these days, called the insula which is a part of the cortex. And what I found fascinating is that the word "disgust" for instance is something that we take away from taste. Well it's, it's -- when we -- we're watching the brain act when somebody taste something that they feel disgusted by, that same area of the brain is involved with the way we feel when we're disgusted about other people or disgusted on situatia - 

00:15:55
ALLEN IVEY So where Paul Eickman(ph) comes in and mentions this new emotion disgust, slowly located in different part of the brain with the different system. 

00:16:00
DR. JOHN RATEY It, it's, it, but. It, it piggy backs on the basic sensory input system- (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
ALLEN IVEY No(ph). 

00:16:05
DR. JOHN RATEY - which is really what I found so fascinating because it's the same area and now, today, the insula is getting much more play in general in terms of emotional processing, not just, ahh the disgust or the pain sensation which it also has a lot to do with. So there is, there is a lot of ahh, inter, interaction and there is a lot of senses like our perceptual perception where we're adding space, all that is very important for instance, in, in what I call the social dyslexia(ph), people, the Autistic Spectrum, Asperger Syndrome, or just your average MIT student, who really doesn't do well with social interactions. Ahh, they -- people that don't know where they're standing or how much -- how close they should stand or how to react to the other person in a, in a very social kind of way. And all that has a lot to do with their basic perceptual abilities in where we're at where the other person is, etcetera. 

00:17:20
ALLEN IVEY So, one of the issues really in terms of reading another persons body language, this very much comes out perceptual systems. 

00:17:30
DR. JOHN RATEY Right, and if you're not doing that accurately or you tend not to use those, you miss a lot of data or you -- and especially if you start off with it being someone of, you never don't have to practice cause because brain and we know is very, very plastic and we develop around things that we're good at as we emerge through development- (crosstalk) 

00:17:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:17:55
DR. JOHN RATEY - and the more practice we get at, at doing things, the better our brains are to accomplish those tests, to read people for instance if you're having problems with balance and rhythm yourself, as, as an infant, it leads to or can lead to problems in developing that sort of feel for yourself as well as for you or for the other person when you are asked to move from just a solitary life to diatic involvement, where you're working with somebody or playing with somebody. 

00:18:35
ALLEN IVEY This is fascinating and new data for me and the whole idea that non verbal communication, which I tend to think of as learning type of thing you're saying. It is of course it's still a learning type of thing but depending on your whole perceptional system in your brain is gonna affect that very deeply. 

00:18:50
DR. JOHN RATEY Oh yes, and, and just think about this that, that someone who's off from the beginning and misses those things. I mean beginning meaning as, as an infant and then growing up through their early years. If they're missing things from that perception-input and their, their comfort level with it, they'll be noticed by the other children that they are a little bit off and that sets up a whole them being off and then being a nerd. But they come across that way. 

00:19:25
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:19:25
DR. JOHN RATEY They come across that way of not being there to fit in. They don't fit in. and, and many of these people then learn to not even want to fit in early on or that it is more comfortable because they meet with the derision or bullying early on because they are easy targets because they don't -- they are not accepted by the group. 

00:19:55
Chapter 3: Brain Plasticity The brain develops new neurons and networks throughout life. 

00:19:55
ALLEN IVEY  So what stands out for me in this particular discussion of perception hence new and it is very important to us as counselors and therapist, I am kind of aware of some of the stuff that goes on the medulla (ph), the cortex in terms of emotion. But I really wasn't aware of perceptual systems and the impact that they have on emotion. And I think that is something that's really important for us, as counselors and therapists to see. Moving on I'd like to talk about one of the concepts that really got me excited and really got me started was is the whole idea brain plasticity cause I was raised with the idea that I have so many neurons as a child and then they disappear, and then I read about brain plasticity and suddenly my world has opened, so could you talk a little bit about this really basic construct(ph). 

00:20:55
Neuroplasticity 

00:20:55
DR. JOHN RATEY Well, it's the most exciting thing I think that has happened in, in neuroscience. It really, the person I call the father of neuroplasticity is Michael Merzenich from UCSF or University of California in San Francisco who now is involved (ph) in doing -- working with training the brain. But he started back in the 80s with monkeys to show that they're, they're attempting to learn a task by sticking electrodes into various nerve cells and cells in different neurons. That they -- when they're attempting to learn something that they could recruit neighboring neurons to help out our nerve cells to help out to accomplish the tasks either to or on the perceptional side as well as the motor side, to get better at accomplishing that task which was, which was a big breakthrough. No one knew that. 

00:22:00
The brain changes with experience 

00:22:00
DR. JOHN RATEY No one would believe that and that lead to the whole move than to say well our brains are really changing. People don't recognize or so immersed these days in their world of neuroscience and that we think, oh yeah, we can change the brain, we can change the brain, but up until, up until really the late 80s, we weren't sure that things changed in the brain. We thought like you said we were given a certain brain structure and all we did was loose stuff. But now we know from of many, many peoples works that in fact the way we learned and adapt to the world is by changing our brain and that's what learning is. It's changing of the brain, so -- And ahh, ahh various people have contributed along the way to this phenomena but what happens when the building block of learning which is really adopting to the world and that's the basic charge of the brain- (crosstalk) 

00:23:00
ALLEN IVEY No(ph). 

00:23:00
DR. JOHN RATEY - to adopt. 

00:23:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh oh. 

00:23:00
DR. JOHN RATEY -and were, really good at this and our brain adopts by wiring together. 

00:23:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:23:05
DR. JOHN RATEY And when by wiring together we mean that a group of nerve cells coordinate and change so its easier for them to fire together. 

00:23:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:23:20
DR. JOHN RATEY And this is a -- was a revolutionary concept back in '58 with what [inaudible] had and no one believed him much. But it was something that people were beginning to, to think about that--that maybe this is happening and then as we moved in to the 80s and the 90s all this was coming to [inaudible] when we got better tools, we could look with our electronic microscope, we could begin to see the actual brain changing. 

00:23:50
Environmental stimulation changes the brain. Effective counseling and therapy change the brain of BOTH the counselor and the client/patient. 

00:23:50
ALLEN IVEY  That brain change is from environmental stimulation school, counseling and psychotherapy, counseling itself changes the brain. 

00:24:05
DR. JOHN RATEY Absolutely and one of the, one of the interesting thing that wasn't in the User's Guide to the Brain is in my new book. It's the Spark the Revolutionary neuroscience of exercising the brain is that most of the hard neurosciences today, I am talking to people that I think are at the forefront of talking about how to affect the brain, relieving depression or anxiety, those kinds of things. Looking at strictly from a brain perspective, you can change the bottom up, you can change the (inaudible ) of it, you can alter that with medicine, but if you don't train the brain in the frontal the cortex, if you don't give other scenarios or help the person relearn a way to approach themselves in the world, you haven't done anything. It's -- the environment sometimes can help that change to take place if you're lucky but using counseling or using cognitive behavioral training is what we call activity dependent learning. And you can make your nerve cells ready to learn but if you are just sitting there watching TV, you're not learning anything or if you are just sitting there playing with the cyber toys that you go over and over and over again, you're not learning. You're not learning the, the or you are not changing -- you are learning but you are changing it in a way that its gonna be helpful, so I think that's where I think that what you see is this people who are sticking electrodes into the brain and changing things. They are also saying at the same time you can change it but you then have to work with the person, which is a big move back to, to, ah, counseling, psychotherapy, (inaudible ) training whatever, ahh, mode you, you go for. 

00:26:10
Chapter 4: Theater Two: Attention, Consciousness, and Cognition Attention is central to development and to counseling and therapy. 

00:26:10
ALLEN IVEY  And I think this is what has been really exciting to me to realize that a lot of what I've been doing has been the right thing, but with neuroscience, neuropsychiatry, I can do a more precise, a more effective job. Ahh, one of my main interests overtime, ahh, in terms of this has been the issue of attention. And I've been writing on this since, ahh, 1968 and yet, I'd never really made this next important step to the brain and attentional systems. So, ahh, in your book, you say attention and consciousness are the foundations in which we create an understanding of the world. Together they form the ground upon which we build the sense of who we are as we define ourselves and relationships to the neuro (ph) physical and social worlds that we inhibit. They are also the basic the functions that give rise " the mind", a real kettle of fish. Where would you go from there? How would you define attention? 

00:27:20
DR. JOHN RATEY Well, that's what I, we started of talking about my fourth, what I call the four theaters of the brain. And the first one is perception. That is how we take information in. And the second one is really attention and, and consciousness. Because they're so intertwined. And we have to do what people call processing. Ahh, they process the information and the attention system is the part of the brain. It's a very big system in the brain, that allows us to process, that wires, parts of our brain that's just, to all these information is distribute all over the place. So unlike it's one center, it's upstairs, downstairs, right-side and left side. And the attention system is sort of the glue or the connection to keep all these information together. And so, the attention system becomes vital to, ahh, or being able to, ahh, take in the world, do something with that information, hold it in mind long enough to store it. 

00:28:25
ALLEN IVEY Now, one, in terms of putting that specifically, the brain, my understanding is that frontal cortex lights up during attention but then it's more complex than just a frontal cortex. 

00:28:35
DR. JOHN RATEY Oh my God yeah! That's where I think the, the, the, it's, it's been an evolution of our understanding of attention back in the 60s and 70s, the, the people who were interested in what we call attention deficit and attentional problems, we're talking about the arousal part of attention. 

00:29:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:29:00
DR. JOHN RATEY And that's something that happens in the brain stem, way down low. 

00:29:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:29:00
DR. JOHN RATEY Ahh, where the sleep-wake, ahh, buttons are, if you will. And that's very important to the attention system because if you're not aroused, you're not awake- (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:29:15
DR. JOHN RATEY - you're not paying attention, okay? That gets missed today because we learn more. Ahh, but that's still a key area of the brain and where some of our medicines work and some of where exercise can work very nicely, (clearing throat) and where novelty partly orks. And that, (clearing throat), I see that the attention system is sort of a wire that goes all over the place, but that starts down on the -- on-button, goes up to through the limbic system, in the amygdala, the hippocampus, learning area, up through the hypothalamus in the reward center, where we have what when we talk motivation, drive, ahh, (clearing throat), feeling of reward, our diction center is important there and our learning, ahh, modules or memory modules are, are guided and are very closely aligned(ph) to this part of the attention system. And then, it goes up in to the frontal cortex and you have to have -- it's like, ahh, I'd like to say it's like a bike, you have to have all the parts working well, if you have one thing to that's off, it's gonna throw, the, the, the whole movement, the whole system off a bit. And, ahh, you have to try and remedy it however you can. (clearing throat), now most people today , ahh, in the, in the -- talk about the evolution, but in the 80s and 90s we were much more focused on motivation and limbic side of the attention system. Ahh, and people meant by motivation that it was a problem with motivation, wasn't that, the person was lazy or they just weren't motivated. It was more on looking at it from a biological perspective. And that sort of now fall out of favor and we'd moved to the frontal cortex, which is also involved. But the, the issue is that all three parts of the brain are key, in, in developing and maintaining attention. And most people today, when they talk about attentional issues, they talk about the executive function, which are all part of the frontal cortex, enormously important. It's our big adaptable computer that has allowed us to evolve and be where we are today. So, all parts of the brain though are involved and people or now that we're getting more comfortable in learning much more about the different parts and more secure, we're also getting more humble- (crosstalk) 

00:32:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:32:00
DR. JOHN RATEY - which is really what happens all the time. 

00:32:05
ALLEN IVEY How long is this? 

00:32:05
DR. JOHN RATEY Ahh, and, and, and more systematic. For instance in dyslexia research, now, the, the research isn't just on the cortex, or just is in, in the area of the brain where we word(ph) or where you store memories of words or you make words, or you speak words, or you hear words up in the cortex, which their often our problems. But it's all through the brain, down to the lowest areas of the brain that are involved and all of them are part of the deal. For instance and with the attention system too, ahh, one of the big, ahh, exciting sub-areas of the brain, the cerebellum, ahh, which in the 80s, ahh, up until really the early 90s, we thought was just involved with the motor system- (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:32:55
DR. JOHN RATEY - keeping us balanced, keeping our rhythm, being able to pass the sobriety test, you know, that's one of the things that gets off when you have too much to drink. Ahh, you, you can't maintain that heel-to-toe, heel-to-toe, you can't, you're less coordinated. Well, we're finding that, that cerebellum is involved with just about every brain function we have- (crosstalk) 

00:33:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:33:25
DR. JOHN RATEY - including, ahh, reading, remembering, ahh, attention certainly, the social brain, emotions, I call that "rhythm and blue" center of the brain because it's, it's a big area that's involved when we look at the scans, etcetera. With bipolar, unipolarp(ph) depression, as well as ADD, autism, a variety of different -- and schizophrenia. Ahh, all these, ahh, different disorders, we see differences in the cerebellum. 

00:34:00
ALLEN IVEY And speaking of that, ahh, I notice there are some psychiatrists now that's saying you really shouldn't do therapy without a brain scan. I think there are some that actually gone that far. Ahh, I'm wondering, ahh, what your thoughts are in terms of just plain diagnosis and, ahh, brain scans? 

00:34:20
DR. JOHN RATEY Those people have made a lot of money, ahh. (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
ALLEN IVEY (laughing) 

00:34:20
DR. JOHN RATEY You know when, it's, it's , ahh, it by no mean is diagnostic of anything. I mean it, it is if there's a problem in the brain, if you can really see a problem, if you can see a tumor, if you can see a, ahh, a brain abnormality. But our scans are by no means diagnostic. If you see the complicated brain systems that we've talked about in, in counseling and therapy. Or we'd be doing that, you'd be hearing a lot more about it. 

00:34:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:34:50
DR. JOHN RATEY The people that are doing it or using actually very, (clearing throat), low level scans of brain scans which are picture of how much the brain is acting that second that take the scan as opposed to our fancy scans now like the FMRI and all kinds of other scans that we have that really show the brain at work- (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:35:15
DR. JOHN RATEY - and responding to sit -- different situations and even the people who are doing that would never talk to the, the efficacy in terms of (inaudible ) the useful things to diagnose people. You know, until we get to further on until we can label things, with -- we thought we had something for ADD for a while but it turned out not to be the case in terms of labeling ahh. different - 

00:35:45
ALLEN IVEY So this is really incredibly helpful because while neuroscience is exciting and important let's not jump too far on the matter. (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
DR. JOHN RATEY No, I mean, you'll see it. Things get, I mean it's nice to have a picture. It's nice to say this is really what's going on. 

00:36:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:36:05
DR. JOHN RATEY I mean it's comforting maybe and see it and maybe it's a little different but it certainly the, the diagnosis and the appropriate treatment isn't something that you can grab and most every case from, it's not something you can grab from the scan or even from an EEG or whatever. It's ah -- or would be doing it, would be doing it. 

00:36:30
ALLEN IVEY Looking at attention, just a little bit differently and own work is basically since sixty six was rooted(ph) in what I call attending behavior for good or ill ah, that's my term. And I talked about counseling is rooted in culturally appropriate eye contact, body language, verbal following(ph) ah. These types of dimension, ah, vocalist, appropriate vocals. And ah, what's been interesting to me is studying this as (inaudible ) a reasonable midpoint attending behavior for the counselor to listen carefully followed but I find listening to you- 

00:37:10
Consciousness as attention times working memory 

00:37:10
ALLEN IVEY - looking at neuroscience it takes the cons of attention much deeper in one section and then it also I think it becomes much more far reaching. Ah. given that, Francis Crick (ph) you quote this defines consciousness as attention times working memory uhm, I think we've got a pretty good sense to the importance of attentional systems. For myself that word "consciousness" is a little bit challenging. I don't think it has do something with, with working memory, we used to call short term memory and but it's a combination of long term. I'm just wondering if you could define consciousness in your perspective? 

00:37:45
DR. JOHN RATEY Well I could. 

00:37:50
ALLEN IVEY It's little challenging. 

00:37:50
DR. JOHN RATEY No. not only little challenging. 

00:37:50
DR. JOHN RATEY It's a when I wrote the book, I, I read 17 books on consciousness because what happens with biologists and physicists like Crick (ph) for instance the biologist (inaudible ) MR. DNA. They evolve and then they -- after they've done their Nobel Prize work in biology or physics then they go into neuroscience or that's what has happened . Then they do work on ahh, you know issues in neuroscience and finally they, they get to consciousness to try to figure out what's going on and then they end up writing a book on creativity. It is there last resort, that's sort of a an evolution of some of the great science that are in the field. However, when I read those 17 different books and they all sounded very credible and I believe to all them as I was reading them. But they were all very different in terms of what -- how they are defining consciousness. And, uhm, and, and what if, what it was, where it was, what was important in the brain. But we do know in Crick's good motto, there was certainly a lot of other very important people that have come up with mottos to talk about consciousness. But, its --his simple equation of attention times working memory, I think is a useful one. Because it involves the attention system to being able to be aroused in attending to the world. And being -- but to hold that information long enough to be aware of it. Now, where that is, what that is, it's how much we're reverberating(ph) circuits we need to keep up going on to develop a sense of consciousness. We're still at, at you know, still arguing over, you know, in the 90's when we were getting all that great machines, to look at up things people where all excited and there was the two son(ph) ah, ah, one, two and three, co, every year they conference on consciousness, that no longer are- (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:40:05
DR. JOHN RATEY - are meeting in there. They are bringing philosophers, psychologists, religious people as well as an art or science people, and they're all talking about consciousness, and they probably will spring up again some time, but it's, it's one of those areas that ah. It's really hard to define, where and how and what but I think most people would agree that you need that -- I mean you certainly need working memory which is one of the big part of the executive functions - big part of the frontal cortex. We have a bigger working memory area when I got to think of it as RAM (ph) then all the other species - animal species are close relatives - that are working memory is better - that allows us to hold things in mind, that allows us to develop a history, that allows us to pull up data from the pasts, as to who we are etcetera. 

00:41:10
ALLEN IVEY And ahh, what I hear there and I'm going to -- if you pardon me going kind of a personal (inaudible ) trip is I'd love your definition of consciousness, because it certainly fits with my own definition coming from a psychological point of view and I'm also quite taken with the RAM (ph) definition for long term memory or working memory goes into RAM (ph) to draw up information. But that's a structural answer. The issue is contact. I also know that you talked about the social brain. Dr. Khan (ph) talks about ah, great over simplification but the consciousness really is the discourse of the other which we really would mean the discourse of social history, environment and interaction. The content of our consciousness comes from social the world and that to me (inaudible [00:42:04.481]) rather nicely to what you are saying there about structuring and how do we react to (inaudible [00:42:09.097]) off the wall (inaudible [00:42:11) 

00:42:10
DR. JOHN RATEY Well no I think if you're looking at your consciousness of who of the self, that that's what it is. 

00:42:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:42:15
DR. JOHN RATEY You know being aware of your history, being aware of what's affected you, being in -- and response to it. And certainly there [inaudible] terms that you call up and run tapes but you know you -- it is the sort of sum total of our experience- (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
ALLEN IVEY No. 

00:42:30
DR. JOHN RATEY And that's what -- I'm sure that what looked on and was trying to get to. 

00:42:35
ALLEN IVEY And, and the exciting part about this is we're talking neuroscience, biology and yet again and again we come back to life experience in the social world. And that's one of the things. That's been attractive neuroscience to me and particularly attractive Dr. Ratey about your work 

00:42:55
Chapter5: Theatre Three: Brain Function Motor Cortex and Movement We give insufficient attention to motor action in counseling and therapy. 

00:42:55
ALLEN IVEY  Now big surprise this is next area of movement. Ahh, the motor cortex, the cerebellum and movement are not usually thought as important in counseling and therapy. Ah. and yet, you give it really high importance in successful therapy and I gather that's kind of a theme your book as well so surprise us and tell us what movement and in the motor cortex has to say to all of us. 

00:43:35
DR. JOHN RATEY Well probably the leading neuroscience person in understanding consciousness has said that consciousness is internalized movement. 

00:43:45
ALLEN IVEY Okay. (inaudible ) on top of that. (crosstalk) 

00:43:50
DR. JOHN RATEY Yeah, well some people don't get it and I didn't get it for the longest time that first of all, I grew up in the 90s and learning about the brain and hemisphere, that was a big thing because the split brain stuff going on it, Stanford and ah California Zoo technology and all the spare and all that exciting stuff, very important stuff. And we grew up taking up right brain, left brain and all their all that excitement going on. As we, as, as they say, as we've evolved even neuroscience was, not much as I thought-much-not as much attention being paid to the right left [inaudible] because what we learn and what we know is that, that it's a shared process that's going on, it's an important function, she has maybe on one side and then more so on the other but they both share pretty drastically. 

00:44:50
Motor cortex led to frontal development 

00:44:50
DR. JOHN RATEY The big split in the brain is really the front and the back, and def -- defining, meaning the front part of our brain is, is, is a frontal, what we call the frontal cortex and the back is, is really, mostly sensory cortex or dealing with sensory information, visual, auditory, spatial, ah, taking input. In front of the motor strip, which sort of is, defines the center of our brain looking at it magnitudenally(ph) is the motor strip. Everything that grew out from the motor strip is what we call the frontal cortex. And everything that grew out in that area allows us to have, what we call the executive function. Now, just think of the words execute, behave, ah you know, from action, ah the way the brain evolved, we know is that, that each new layer expansion was a refinement of the stuff behind it. 

00:46:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:46:00
DR. JOHN RATEY So we got better, we got better at adapting, we got better at manipulating, we got more precise in our movements and then we began to plan and to sequence and to anticipate and to evaluate our consequences of our actions and then we got abstract, and then we got Shakespeare, and Byron(ph), and Kitts(ph), and Physics. 

00:46:30
ALLEN IVEY That is really and exiting thing, of thinking we start with the motor [inaudible] cortex and move forward, and that's really in a sense of how children develop as well. 

00:46:40
DR. JOHN RATEY  Yes. And then, the way we see it with the, the toddlers, ah, there as, as, as a child is beginning to move today and move very irregularly and they sway from side to side, they're not directed, they're not discrete in their movements. They're more ape like, and that would distinguishes us from the lower great apes. That we are very discrete, very directive, very precise in our movements, part of that comes from all this develop and evolve architecture in our frontal cortex that allows us to rehearse even, and plan, and correct very quickly, ah our more spontaneous movements so that we get to our goal, ah, in a precise kinda way. 

00:47:35
Motor action and practice critical to counseling 

00:47:35
ALLEN IVEY So this is the sense, is something that we do in counseling psychotherapy we really don't give it enough attention, the idea of doing I think about-ah - for example [inaudible] training, where you do the role play, you're actually there are involved in the [inaudible] as well as the executive function. Ah, so bringing more movement in the counseling and psychotherapy can potentially be useful. 

00:48:00
DR. JOHN RATEY Oh I think so. I think that was a big-- that always been the big problem with psychoanalysis from a philosophical point of view, is that you could understand, understand, understand, but you have to act also. And I think today, we're getting much more into that as an action kind of thing. And, and the way the brain learns things is, is through actions, so I'm fond of saying, that you fake till you make it. You act as if you have this skill, or you know how to do things and you try it out or you do it with scripts and you, you, you walk through it, ah much as you do with people that don't know how to do things very well and then they begin to internalize that, that's what we call internalization in a way, but it's actually your brain is learning and making those, ah, connections in the brain and then practice, practice, practice. You have an internalization, of, of whatever the skill is, or the response that you want. 

00:49:05
ALLEN IVEY No, I can help but think, ah, ah [inaudible] who passed away this past week, ah, and the, the story about how he learned, how to be more social, apparently he is one of this nerdy types that wasn't, but he, he would go to the park, he'd sit there and he's made a determination. He's gonna talk to every woman that sat down on the bench beside him. And a hundred and thirty women, he finally got in one date, ah, but he learns social skills, out of that particular experience, so it's basically, to say and do, and the follow up. Ah, there also is a whole issue direct physical action as the result follow-up of therapy and [inaudible] is pretty good at that to go out and do something. The same time mental rehearsal apparently lights up these same areas of the brain. 

00:49:50
DR. JOHN RATEY Oh yes! 

00:49:55
Imaging or mental rehearsal affects brain 

00:49:55
DR. JOHN RATEY that's been a -- that's what's exiting, that even the -- I guess it was in the 90s, on the airplane you'd see all these magazines having these cybernetics, or these, I forget what it was called, but you had these tapes to help you be a better golfer, or better skier, and all that. Well, there is something to that, ah, this sort of just visualize what you're doing or what you're attempting your goal to be, ah, to actually training those same, ah parts of the brain that are involved with doing that action to think about the plan and to sequence and to imagine. Ah, one of the great stories is that, forget the lady's name now, but if she did have won the gold medal in diving at the Australia Olympics, and she was like number 10 in the world, ah, about six months before, ah, she was due to compete it for the U.S. and she broke her ankle. So she couldn't dive for three months, and obviously that's an important time to be practicing. So she went up everyday and spent six to eight hours on the diving board with her coach, thinking of what she was about to do, and what she couldn't do because of her broken ankle. Then had three months to, to get back in shape, and practice, so she ended up surprising the world by winning the gold medal. And part of that was just the visualization, the training, the imagining of that very, you know obviously very important skill. And one of the great things, I think that people don't recognize is that we took win, win at Newsweek, or Times some years ago, did a cover story on the great athletes. We took, took one, Jerry, and Martin, and [inaudible], Michael Jordan of course, Wayne Gretzky, and ah, Joe Montana from football, and they asked them. They interviewed them, and they were trying to discern what about them that was different, that they've been different, and it wasn't natural ability, it was that they love to practice, all of them love practice, they did it over and over and over again, you know that Michael loved to be out there, and always was on the court; Joe Montana, the day after the Super Bowl that they won, he was out throwing passes to (inaudible [00:52:37.886]). Every (inaudible [00:52:38.348]) at those people loved it, valued it, loved to get better, loved to try some stuff new, always were honing their skills. That's what separates the true superstars from the average Joe, though obviously they have to have some facility to begin with and genetic endowment certainly but its the practicing element that really shows up. 

00:53:05
ALLEN IVEY Dr. Ratey, ah, I really picked up on that idea of practice, practice, practice. We hear about Joe Montana, I think about Tiger Woods, and a lot of these people are practicing single specific skills. Uh, if I known for anything, it's the whole idea of teaching specific single skills in counseling and therapy such as focusing in on identifying and reflecting feelings, specifics of how to engage in various counseling therapy strategies. Practice, practice, practice is really, really, central uh, and as I listen to you I'm saying really what is going on with practice is that motor coordination, uh, uh which is really critical, and uh, and you've also brought up the idea of mental practice being important. 

00:53:55
Chapter 6: Theatre Three: Brain Function Stress and Memory Unless we are challenged with some stress, development and change are near impossible. 

00:53:55
ALLEN IVEY  But one thing that can really cause a problem at all is stress. And, uh, what is stress, what happens with the stress response in the middle of practice, practice or trying to do something? And I more and more see stress as one of the central problems of the human condition. 

00:54:25
Stress can be problem or solution. 

00:54:25
DR. JOHN RATEY Yes, but in my new book, Spark - 

00:54:30
ALLEN IVEY Your new book? 

00:54:30
DR. JOHN RATEY The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain,- 

00:54:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:54:35
DR. JOHN RATEY - stress is a very important chapter. Not only because of what you're suggesting is that it, it, it roads our brain for one thing and then interrupts a lot of our abilities to learn and remember. But that's the high end of stress. See, then -- this -- my new book talks a lot about what we call stress inoculation- (crosstalk) 

00:55:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:55:00
DR. JOHN RATEY or the good side of stress. 

00:55:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:55:00
DR. JOHN RATEY Because we, stress really is a spectrum. And we have to appreciate that up to a certain point, stress is very good for us. Stress is there to help us do things- (crosstalk) 

00:55:15
ALLEN IVEY You don't run unless it's a challenge. 

00:55:15
DR. JOHN RATEY (inaudible [00:55:18.149]). It helps us meet the challenges, right. And from getting up in the morning, throughout the day, to learning, all that is stress. And then you go over the top which is what you're referring to where it's stressful. What most of us think that is toxic stress. And that interferes with everything. That sends up, uh, gets too much of our sympathetic nervous system going, our hearts beating too fast, we're breating weird or muscles are too tense, and we're starting to generate a lot of cortisol which goes all over the brain but it mainly goes and this is something that we just learned in the past 5 years, in our hippocampus or our memory storage area. Which is before 2000, we didn't think was much involved with emotions per se, just memory. 

00:56:10
Stress is necessary for learning and growth BUT too much stress is damaging. Too much stress produces cortisol 

00:56:10
DR. JOHN RATEY  This is a memory control area. Now we know that this is really a stress control area too, because most of our, or a lot of our cortisol receptors are in our hippocampus. Which makes sense because when we're -- when we have a big challenge, and the stress hormone gets released, it allows for us to remember the events- (crosstalk) 

00:56:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:56:40
DR. JOHN RATEY - where the food is. How we got to escape from the tiger on the plane, or, uh, you know, all kinds of situations that we got out of. We wanna remember that, and initially, stress is good. What's bad is when we're in the chronic stress state. When we don't have the chance to recover and what we think of as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, high levels of anxiety, that are all part of a continuous stress response. This absolutely shuts down not just our executive functions but our ability to store memories, uh, and even can erode uh, our memory banks and our, our frontal cortex which we [inaudible] overtime. And this is one of the things that we've seen now in, in mood problems and, uh, in aging, premature aging, or aging due to too much stress, and that we know happens. We erode the -- our nerve cells, we make them thinner, uh, we actually kill some perhaps, but we certainly wither them away and make them less effective. 

00:57:55
ALLEN IVEY So stress management, or stress inoculation is really, is central issue for us all, uh, regardless of where we're coming from. At the same time, I really hear the idea of stress balance rather than a stress-free life. 

00:58:10
Mission and goals help keep stress directed. 

00:58:10
DR. JOHN RATEY Oh I, we, we, stress-free life means never moving. I mean uh, it, it, it really means that. Ahh, but its, its having the stress that gives you the direction and orientation and what I talk about in the current feeding of the brain is having the right mission. Having the right goal in mind, uh, that keeps you going, that keeps your stress directed towards whatever you're wishes and desires are. 

00:58:45
ALLEN IVEY And I think that, uh, kinda to wind up this, this motor area, I think about uh, perhaps a useful analogy is just plain muscle work at the gym. And we stress our, we stress our muscles to the point of, almost to the point of exhaustion. And that breaks down a challenge helps them move to new levels of strength. And if we go too far. 

00:59:10
Stress is a call for action. 

00:59:10
DR. JOHN RATEY Well, you, you, you're speaking to my chapter in my book Because what stress is, is a, is a call to action, basically. And then it is, is it's damaged. It's damaged. And the muscle analogy is a good one. And it's the same thing that happens in the brain. Because your building material. You're, you're, you're even thinking. Your having to use uh, now we know what happens intracellular (ph). You're having to use a ATP to change things to make more proteins, eventually to learn new material. That's stress. 

00:59:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

00:59:50
DR. JOHN RATEY And from stress, you get breakdown products. And the breakdown products are those free radicals. My idea of a free radical in New York in cartoon to years ago showed this uh, uh, Berkeley students running out of a, a jail cell, and carrying signs, free radicals. You know... 

01:00:15
Laughing 

01:00:15
DR. JOHN RATEY And uh, but we make them when we use ourselves. We make all kinds of stuff and I call it the toxic waste. Well, what's useful about learning, or, uh, uh, exercise, in, in a big way, uh, and, and actually some of our foods that we eat that are very important that they stimulate these, these toxicity in [inaudible] which then if we stop and recover , you build up an internal machinery oxidated enzymes, and these anti-uh, toxic waste proteins, that make the cell more resilient further stresses. So, you really build internally, what I'd see is, ah, an army of responses to the future, ah, stresses that inevitably will come in your way. And so, that's why you have made -- you make perhaps, intracellular, you make for healthier cells with the right kind of stress or excitements, you know, and directed where there is a recovery process, where there is -- you're not on it all the time, but the problem is it is with post traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, it stressed all the time. And you never have that chance for the recovery process. That's why your knowledge to the gym works. They, they say -- the advice is, " Yeah, go break some cells and stress and strain and, and cause some damage," but you gotta give it a few days to recover. You just don't go back at it in the afternoon the same way because it's, it, it doesn't work like that or, or bodies need a chance to recover and so do our brains. And recovery is essential. 

01:02:10
Confrontation produces growth 

01:02:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. So, so as part of this, I think about gross work in neuropsychology and neuropsychiatry, ah, where you talk about confronting patients as really the building block of, ah, of growth, confronting a patient rather than just hearing her story, bringing out discrepancies, differences and so forth to the very confrontation directly with the patient. Stressful causes, with a little bit of work, causes a little bit of breakdown in the possibility of growth. 

01:02:40
DR. JOHN RATEY Certainly. And it, and it -- and then the growth can come if certainly if the patient is held in the old way we used to talk about psychotherapy. They're, they're held with it that you're support of -- you're there but you're confronting them that it does cause a break in that dollop that they got into with their -- whatever than the neurotic issues are, and cause them to hopefully re-grow, ah, different connections. And that's essentially what we do with, what we do with learning their responses to any of these issues that, that people have, whether it's anxiety. Ah, they're learning this scenario to a phobic - previous phobic situation, what -- or depression, breaking that dollop that people get stuck in. Ah, and that's where it's, it, it really important to have a connection because a connection helps the building and helps with the recovery process. 

01:03:45
Chapter 7: Theatre Three: Brain Function Memory, Language, Emotion, and the Social Brain 

01:03:45
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, I think you give an incredibly powerful, ah, explanation of why we need to think much more, more (inaudible ) in counseling and psychotherapy. Ah, and I would, again, recommend your new book, ah, the "You just got in the brain," ah, will continue to say, ah, I'm (inaudible ) with the Colbert report, "look at this great book, folks." And it is a great book. I've read I, I've read the user's, ah, guide to the brain twice now and I was really struck, ah, how much more I got out of it the second time. But let's turn to the next theatre, memory, ah, how do we make a memory? 

01:04:30
DR. JOHN RATEY Well, the next theatre is actually all. There were other brain function, memory, language, and, and emotions, and social brain and all that. That's the way I see it. That -- the first perception, attention, consciousness, and then on top, that the -- those are the first two theatres, if you will, and then you have all these other brain functions. But we make a memory by, basically, by linking a group of cells all over the brain and people have to remember that, ah, when I'm talking about cellular linkage, your linking cells in the visual, in the auditory cortex, in the frontal cortex and the, and the, ah, parietal cortex, the decision cortex, ah, and bringing up associations to whatever the new memory is. 

01:05:20
Hippocampus coordinates memory 

01:05:20
DR. JOHN RATEY  And all those got linked. So you're not talking about the downed of one cell to another, but that's a basic way we learn what happens as you're looking at single cells. And, well, the way we make a memory is we take in information and process it up in the frontal cortex and at the same time, ah, link -- linking it altogether all over the brain through the hippocampus, as a major area where, ah, memories are linked, sounds that they're stored there. They're linked up its grand central station for the memories for a lot of the, ah, issues of memory. 

01:06:05
Amygdala-emotional intensity 

01:06:05
DR. JOHN RATEY And, ah, and it's, that's sits right beside the amygdala, which is the intensity button or the survival button of the brain. So, it's very much, ah, has to do with how intense the experiences because it turns on the hippocampus and makes it ready to, to sort of do its learning. But, at the basic level of memory, you're linking two cells one to another. 

01:06:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

01:06:35
DR. JOHN RATEY But this happens, as I say, distributed all throughout the brain. And the linkage comes about with one cell being a -- sending a message across to the other, and it having, ah, ah -- being something that's repeated because of your wish to learn it or being to step by the, the intensity because it's important, and there might be a stress factor there, that helps it, ah, the intensity grow and with one transmission across the synapse. It, ah, the -- they, the one -- the part what we called the postsynaptic side or the receiving side, gets to be more sensitized and makes it easier for the information to transport across from the pre-synaptic nerve cell. 

01:07:30
Practice and repetition needed for new neural networks 

01:07:30
DR. JOHN RATEY This happens again and again. We practice, practice, practice. Eventually, this causes, ah, redistribu -- redistribution of pockets of, ah, receptors and pockets of, ah, neurotransmitters on the one side and receptors, and then, that simulates the, the genes to send --- to say, "Look, we really got to remember this." And then the genes say, "Ok, we gotta get busy and we're gonna make more synapses or more connections on our synapses." And then you see actual as, as more and more of the stimulation occurs, more and more practice occurs because it's important. You actually see growth of these dendrites or these branches from the cells to meet, to sort of further link up and then they link up to another million or so cells. 

01:08:30
Stimulation produces cell growth 

01:08:30
DR. JOHN RATEY  You know, I was done it, ah, Neuroscience Conference some years ago now and this fellow came over from the Max Planck Institute and he was looking at a single cell binding together using electron microscope and fancy equipment and, and he stimulated the one cell when you're sought sort of stimulating the other, and then all of a sudden, you saw these dendrites beginning to grow out. 

01:09:00
ALLEN IVEY And you actually see them? 

01:09:00
DR. JOHN RATEY Yeah. And I - and it was like the most quiet room you'd ever heard, you know? Everybody was stunned because you'd actually see it grow. And I, I have a slide of it that I used and I say, "This is for now for neuroscientist." You know, that -- I mean, it something that's so striking that everybody's attention is rapped. 

01:09:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

01:09:25
DR. JOHN RATEY It was just, ah, so, oh inspiring but you actually can see that happen. 

01:09:30
ALLEN IVEY  Hhmm. And what made that happen on that particular- (crosstalk) 

01:09:35
DR. JOHN RATEY That was the stimulation- (crosstalk) 

01:09:35
ALLEN IVEY Stimulation. 

01:09:35
DR. JOHN RATEY - stimulation is practice. It's - they use an electrical stimulation- 

01:09:40
ALLEN IVEY But the same thing would happen with, ah - 

01:09:45
Counseling produces new networks 

01:09:45
DR. JOHN RATEY Absolutely, with, with, with repeating or- 

01:09:45
ALLEN IVEY Even today talking to me, you're repeating things and suddenly, I get new insights from just listening to you. If I'm actually building right now, this is gonna be some neuronal nets? 

01:09:55
DR. JOHN RATEY All the time. 

01:09:55
ALLEN IVEY And that's what we do in counseling and psychotherapy, is build neuronal nets. 

01:10:00
DR. JOHN RATEY All the time, everyday. Ah, if you're adaptive, if you're not just sitting and watching, ah, TV and sort of possibly taking it in, the more active you are on the process, the more engaged, by the way, because the linkage -- I mean important thing about counseling is that, with the other person, everything works better, in, in, in terms of learning, you know, and everything works better. Certainly, if you get to a point where you feel like you're working together, of course, it's not like it immediately happens. But if you get to that point, it works better. Your brain works better. You actually -- all kinds of good stuff, more serotonin, more dopamine, all of that, ah, helps to facilitate those -- ah, that growth and development of your, of your nerve cells. And then, all these great new growth factors that we're just exploding with information about these days, ah, also come from, ah, engagement with another person. 

01:11:05
Let's review that important statement once again. Counseling produces new networks 

01:11:05
ALLEN IVEY  Even today talking to me, you're repeating things and suddenly, I get new insights from just listening to you if I'm actually building right now, listening to you, some neuronal nets? 

01:11:20
DR. JOHN RATEY All the time. 

01:11:20
ALLEN IVEY And that's what we do in counseling and psychotherapy, is build new new neural -- neuronal nets. 

01:11:25
DR. JOHN RATEY All the time. Everyday. Ah, if you're adapting, if you're not just sitting and watching, ah, TV and sort of passively taking it in, the more active you are on the process and the more engaged, by the way, because the linkage -- I mean, the important thing about counseling is that with the other person, everything works better in, in, in terms of learning, you know? And everything works better as if -- certainly, if you get to the point where you feel like you're working together. Of course, it's not like it immediately happens. But if you get to that point, it works better. Your brain works better. You actually -- all kinds of good stuff, more serotonin, more dopamine, and all that, ah, helps to facilitate those -- that growth and development of your, of your nerve cells. And then all these great new growth factors that we're just exploding with information about these days also come from, ah, engagement with another person. 

01:12:30
Chapter 8: Memory, Wellness, and Positive Psychology 

01:12:30
ALLEN IVEY  Now, in our last book, ah, Mary, Mary Bradford Ivey and I, focused much more increasingly on a wellness approach. And as you well know positive psychology is one of the current hot topics. Ah, I was wondering what you feel about these people that are taking, ah, the more positive approach to counseling and psychotherapy as opposed to might be a problem-centered approach. Ah, I see pluses and minuses in that, but I'm wondering what your thoughts are. 

01:13:05
DR. JOHN RATEY Well, I think what you're doing -- the, the -- I'm all fours that the wellness approach is where I'm at, ah, because, ah, I think there's so much that we do that if you put it in the right state, ah, the, the better legal learn and adapt is, is really enhanced. And, and, and that's what our brain is made to do. And if we continue to do that, we age less and we age better and we make our lives better as we go along. Uhm, so, that is really a very important area. 

01:13:45
Wellness methods produce change 

01:13:45
DR. JOHN RATEY The positive versus the problem solving -- developing a positive approach and a, and, and developing a, ah, for instance, you using humor and, and spending, ah, more time laughing than, than worrying and the more positive to me means the more active approach to doing things. And, and the more action we, we put in things, ah, the less we're gonna sit and stew. And we know what happens now in the amygdala. The amygdala has two different parts where information comes in and we can -- it can send -- and this is our intensity button, ah, sort of the beginning of our emotional life. It can send information to make us more catatonic, ah, and sort of, ah, frozen, which is what happens to animals and to humans when you're up in front of a large group and you get struck down. Ah, you're frozen as opposed to another pathway that is the more active pathway that goes up to the frontal cortex and the motor cortex. 

01:14:55
Wellness counteracts negative in amygdala 

01:14:55
DR. JOHN RATEY And we know that you can influence that pathway by acting more. And so, positive psychology gives you more action up here, so when you're, when you're getting that stressful or that unpleasant or that difficult kind of signal that comes in, you're less likely to go into that frozen, catatonic, stewing which then just gets you into the negative dollop, ah, and causes more stress, causes more brain erosion, ah, as opposed to the more action, ah, active coping kind of, ah, approach. 

01:15:35
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, and what I've been arguing is what are your strengths? And, we got some strengths identified. We'll then look at some of your issues and how can we use those strengths to deal with your issues. The other thing I worry about if we take a negative problem point of view, ah, I think particularly, an inpatient, ah, ah, ah, psychotic and so forth, look at this strictly as a problem, your basic, you know, you're just gonna produce more cortisol and more disruption. 

01:16:00
DR. JOHN RATEY Yeah, and- 

01:16:00
ALLEN IVEY And you have to find some positive way out. 

01:16:00
DR. JOHN RATEY  Right and then there -- you're in, in, in developing skills that will help them be more active in their lives. I think it's really huge and really, really important. And that's why one of the, one of the things I've -- having been through a number of, of downturns in the economy after the, the internet bubble burst. Ah, I had a lot of very successful computer people who were then out of work and got very depressed and no one was hiring and they were sitting at home and, ah, and had been doing this for a period of time and then sometimes years. Uhm, and would sink further and further into their depression, and then they weren't doing anything. Nothing on it is directed out because they had tried and tried and -- whatever. 

01:16:55
Get the client active and exercising 

01:16:55
DR. JOHN RATEY So, one of the first things I told them to do, was to get to the gym first thing in the morning to help them structure their unstructured lives. Why? Well, that has so many positive effects. 

01:17:10
ALLEN IVEY Oh, absolutely. 

01:17:10
DR. JOHN RATEY And it helps with their mood, at their anxiety, their stress level, but it also gets them moving. And the movement as opposed to sitting and just being on the computer and playing video games or watching TV or whatever, ah, or other addictions that they might get into, but by moving that was a distraction, as well as, an action - 

01:17:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

01:17:35
DR. JOHN RATEY - that usually generates -- I mean, most people, a good feeling and, and, ah, again, my new book is all about that, about how that works in the brain, but it also is activating the positive pathways as opposed to just, ah, sitting and, and stewing. 

01:18:00
ALLEN IVEY And again, you're hitting the motor cortex, the thing gradually moves forward developmentally and in the here and now to the frontal cortex. 

01:18:10
DR. JOHN RATEY Yeah, well -- no, -- then, in what we see and what we know with exercises is, is you pump up the frontal cortex like crazy, ah, and that's one of the big benefits of exercise. 

01:18:20
Aging and memory 

01:18:20
ALLEN IVEY Ah, let's talk just a little about aging and memory. Ah, how does aging relate to memory issues, and how do you suggest that, ah, just with this aging population coming on, ah, and memory, of course is a big issue, ah, to people as they get pass 60? 

01:18:35
DR. JOHN RATEY Right. Well, I think, we know there are three things that absolutely you can do. One, you can eat less. And caloric restriction is a huge -- it is the one thing that has been proven to extend life of animals, cognitive -- ah, the, the retired cognitive decline in humans, people that really starve themselves but challenge themselves with, ah, ah, caloric restrictions. The other side of that is that 66 percent of American now are overweight and on the weight of 75 percent in 2010 or so it's estimated. Obesity itself or overweightness itself causes more rapid cognitive decline. When you get to one of the problems with obesity, ah, a bunch of them, but one of the big ones is, ah, glucose problems where you have metabolic syndrome and pre-diabetes, that causes memory, ah, areas of the brain to start to shrivel and change very, very rapidly. And, ah, so one of the, the pieces of the, the puzzle is to really maintain as, ah, your weight even below what, ah, as opposed to BMI as, ah, if you can. Uhm, second big thing, is, is learning. Ah, we know that people that are engaged continuously challenging their brains to remember or doing the kind of puzzles, sudoku, crossword, playing chess, playing bridge, doing posit science, ah, the, the new computer programs that have some, ah, ability to train you, learning a new language, all that really builds in your memory storage, you build your brain. And, along -- but that, that works specifically on the learning and memory areas of your brain in specific ways. Caloric restriction works everywhere. 

01:20:55
Physical exercise enriches brain cells 

01:20:55
DR. JOHN RATEY  The other big one is exercise, is physical aerobic exercise. That causes the positive stress that I mentioned earlier. But it also causes more than anything else that we know, a release of what we call the "nerve growth factors." 

01:21:15
ALLEN IVEY  Uh-hmm. 

01:21:20
DR. JOHN RATEY These are factors that were only recently discovered in the past 10 years, ah, that released by the nerve cells when they're stressed, when they're active, to cause growth. I call it the miracle grows of the brain. It's brain fertilizer. Ah, and this allows your brain cells to remain healthy, to grow bigger and more - 

01:21:45
ALLEN IVEY Which chemicals are these? 

01:21:45
DR. JOHN RATEY - (inaudible ). The -- there's a bunch of them. But the, the big one has been BDNF for "Brain-derived neurotropic factor." That little bugger has been -- is a focus of so much research in the past seven years. And now, it's sort of -- that we're looking beyond that. Ah, but that's released with brain action. It's released greatly. There's nothing close to except a seizure. We'll release a lot more of this BDNF. Ah, but exercise, physical exercise, is, ah, is a way to increase this growth factor more than anything else, including our antidepressants, lithium, all the other, ah, medicines that we use. 

01:22:35
ALLEN IVEY  And I guess that's thrown- 

01:22:40
Diet, nutrition, exercise central to counseling 

01:22:40
ALLEN IVEY - a little advertisement for our book and also the Sweeney-Meyers Book on Wellness because of true factor analysis of what, ah, involves the kind of 14 factors on wellness. And two critical factors were diet, nutrition, and exercise, physical exercise in terms of overall wellness. And so this is an area which counseling and therapy simply have not given enough attention to and others. I think I'm at the point now where I think it's almost unethical not to consider adding some type of exercise regime to every counseling and therapy interview. 

01:23:10
DR. JOHN RATEY  There was just a statement by the president of the American Medical Association that said just that. That it's, that it's a moral obligation of every physician to recommend exercise to everyone of his client -- or his or her clients, ah, patients coming in, because of its profound effect on all the cardiovascular and, ah, bones, and muscles, and, ah, health aspects. But, the big thing that I think of -- what I say in my new book is that exercise isn't really doing exercises or really just doing it for the body. It's really made for the brain because the brain really responds to aerobic exercise. 

01:23:55
ALLEN IVEY  From the motor cortex, again, becomes more central. 

01:24:00
Thinking brain - extension of motor cortex 

01:24:00
DR. JOHN RATEY Well, it's not only that. The -- see, the motor cortex is connected to our thinking brain, you know? It is -- it's an -- a thinking brain is an extension of our motor cortex. And when you're, when you're moving, you're, you're causing the release of all these great little things that cause building, building in our brains. And, and then, what's really exciting is this -- that ala George Bush's, ah, you know, problems with it, uhm, that we actually have stem cells everywhere in our body. And in our brain, we have stem cells, ah, in one particular place that actually feed into our hippocampus. S- (crosstalk)- 

01:24:45
Neurogenesis - new cell development 

01:24:45
DR. JOHN RATEY - we now know that we make more brain cells everyday from these stem cells. And our hippocampus grows if you continue to learn, if you keep your stress level, ah, at a certain level and with exercise. And, and, the, the effect of, of exercise is tremendous on cell growth. So, ah, you know, this is -- most people focus on that but, ah, because it's so sexy and exciting, it's called neurogenesis. But the whole business of, of, ah, of, of living the right kind of life, being healthy and, and friendly and, and well-tuned and exercised is that your, your brain's nerve cells are doing better at what they're supposed to be doing all over the brain, and certainly in the hippocampus where you repopulate, ah, cells. And as we age, that tends to diminish even though our cells are still -- their stem cells are still there, we tend to not move them along as much, ah, this from, ah, decline of all kinds of things. But, with exercise, you get that to boost so you actually increase the, ah, movement of stem cells into these new nerve cells all the time. 

01:26:15
ALLEN IVEY You make me very happy that I've been doing systematic exercise since I was 35. I think I am going to continue all the more. 

01:26:20
DR. JOHN RATEY Oh, yes. 

01:26:20
Chapter 9: Emotion 

01:26:20
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, let's, ah, move on to emotion. Ah, ah, this is, of course, ah, traditionally, our center of counseling is psychotherapy. Given what you've said, I'll be fascinating to find out, ah, ah, what you have to say here. Ah, I've been -- I've -- for me, I, I've talked for years. Ah, we've talked for years in our book, you know, the basic emotions: the sad, mad, glad, and angry. And now Ekman has added added disgust, and I think another one. Ah, and you've mentioned how disgust as, ah, brain functions. Ah, I've been just fascinated to find that our ol' rubric(ph), ah, turns out to be true via neuroscience. I was wondering if you could tell us about, ah, ah, maybe start by where the negative emotions, the sad, mad, and anger, develop and stored. 

01:27:20
DR. JOHN RATEY Well, I didn't -- it's, it's not like that. I mean- (crosstalk) 

01:27:25
ALLEN IVEY Not like that, okay. 

01:27:25
DR. JOHN RATEY - it, it, it's not like- (crosstalk) 

01:27:25
ALLEN IVEY Right. 

01:27:25
DR. JOHN RATEY - that at all. It's a, it's a, it's stored all over the place, if you will. You know, it, it -- what happens is, okay, with -- let's take anger. What about anger? Well, anger is a response to a threat, right? I spent 12 years writing about anger and from, ah, every perspective: anthropologic, psychologic, subanalytic, and biologic. Okay. Anger is a response to a threat. And what happens is you stress, you stress, you turn on your stress system, okay, to fight or to flee or to freeze. 

01:28:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hhmm. 

01:28:05
DR. JOHN RATEY Ah, and that -- then, you -- with, with people who have too much anger either have too sensitive triggers, too many sensitive triggers, or they don't have the frontal cortex to block it to say inhibit, no, don't do that. Evaluate. Ah, let's stop and consider rather than just respond. 

01:28:35
Antisocial brain patterns 

01:28:35
ALLEN IVEY Now, I understand in a social -- ah, clients have that particular problem. The frontal cortex is underactive under stress. 

01:28:40
DR. JOHN RATEY Underactive and it's under -- there's even changes in volume that is -- are suggestive of, of, of genetic, ah, input, ah, right from the beginning that they don't put the brakes on that, that, ah, that anger response. But it's usually a combination of genes and environment that really bring about that problem. So, anger is the system response to the situation and you can have too much of it and you can, ah, not have enough, ah, the -- this inhibitory cortex going on that puts the brakes on so that you can use your executive function to consider, to evaluate consequences, to plan, to rehearse, to imagine the future, all those things get turned off in the usual tantruming(ph) anger situation. It's completely dominated by the load on amygdala, which is like, "I'm in threat. I have to survive. I'm gonna kill." 

01:29:45
ALLEN IVEY In the -- while the amygdala is, is a center. Ah, we really need to sort of think of emotions more as a system, rather than a specific thing. 

01:29:55
DR. JOHN RATEY Right. It's not one place or another. 

01:29:55
ALLEN IVEY You're gonna make me revise my book. 

01:30:00
DR. JOHN RATEY Now, for instance, mood, mood, ah, ah, ah, depression. 

01:30:00
ALLEN IVEY  Uh-hmm. 

01:30:05
DR. JOHN RATEY Okay, let's talk about depression. It's a whole new way of thinking about depression these days. 

01:30:10
ALLEN IVEY So here, we're at sad, yeah. 

01:30:10
DR. JOHN RATEY Well - 

01:30:10
Physical results of depression 

01:30:10
DR. JOHN RATEY Well, yeah. Ah- 

01:30:15
ALLEN IVEY (laughing) 

01:30:15
DR. JOHN RATEY Ah, yeah, I would go a little further than sad but, but sad, okay. What we think of now for people who are depressed, sort of the end result of being sad too long, maybe, ah, is that our brain's ability to adapt stops. Our neuroplasticity begins to stop. And, in fact, we see erosion of the brain, the frontal cortex, the hippocampus. 

01:30:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

01:30:45
DR. JOHN RATEY  Ah, parts of the temporal cortex actually shrink. We actually have seen this on scans and whatnot, in chronic depression. 

01:30:55
Physical results of depression 

01:30:55
DR. JOHN RATEY  You see the wasting way, you know, from work with PTSD where you have, ah, chronic state of stress and depression that you have, ah, got and it made -- I mean, it may not be true that you actually erode the hippocampus. But we'd know for a fact that that this happens when we use animal models and we use or follow this with humans. So there's this -- the way I see depression now is a problem in neuroplasticity in general. And think about it. What happens when you're depressed? You don't learn anything new. You can't think your way out of the problem. You can't think your way out to remember that you weren't such a bad person all the time, when you're really immersed in that depressive feeling, you can't call up those memories, and you certainly can't adapt to new situations which is what you're supposed to be doing in terms of the brain's function. So, it's a real shutdown and then an erosion or what we call the wintering of the brain, and you see this- 

01:32:10
Effective therapy grows new cells 

01:32:10
DR. JOHN RATEY - and with treatment at times with CBT, or counseling, or medicine or ECT, electroshock therapy, or even deep implants. You see, ah, ah, a re-birth, of, of, of this neuroplasticity, the brain begins to function like it's supposed to get. We actually see regrowths, ah, of some of the withering nerve cells. So, that's -- I think, it again is sort of a system. It's, ah, you know and, ah, Richard Davidson in the '90s was talking about depression as being, ah, right hemisphere over activity and left hemisphere was under active and that may or may not -- I mean, there are differences but it's not nearly as, as, ah, solid as, as weak. Now, that sort of emphasis is much more on, on -- in shutting the whole brain down and you get stuck, and I- 

01:33:20
"Brainlock" and psychopathology 

01:33:20
DR. JOHN RATEY - I like to think of some of our more problematic, ah, issues in psychiatry and psychology, ah, ah, anxiety syndromes, phobias, depression, ah, as a model of having your brain in a brainlock situation where it's locked in and you can't work its way out of, of that situation. So, you either avoid with the, with the anxiety syndromes. You avoid the triggers. You avoid the -- you, you put yourself in jail, ah, away from whatever it is that you're afraid of, like in a social situation particularly, or with depression, you can't think of anything else. You're constantly in how horrible you are and how horrible your life has been and how -- maybe how people have done your wrong but maybe how bad you are as you deserve that kind of treatment. So you get locked in and you can't think of anything else and, and it's sort of a locked-in syndrome that, ah, that dominates. 

01:34:25
ALLEN IVEY Hmm, that locked-in syndrome and -- or the word brai-, brainlock kinda rings true for me at another, ah, level. I can't help but think of, ah, when I was director for college counseling center, somebody would come in who have broken up with some-, somebody else and they got it basically in a form of brainlock and the sadness. 

01:34:45
DR. JOHN RATEY  Right. 

01:34:50
ALLEN IVEY And it's -- so a lot of just normal sadness 

01:34:50
DR. JOHN RATEY Oh. 

01:34:50
ALLEN IVEY - and worry is, is a brainlock- 

01:34:55
DR. JOHN RATEY Oh, absolutely. I think it's all the way down. I mean, I think it's a spectrum and, and a lot of this comes from early work with the obsessive-compulsive disorder which is truly- 

01:35:05
ALLEN IVEY A real brainlock. 

01:35:05
DR. JOHN RATEY - a brainlock, that's real brainlock. But, ah, you're, you're counseling this, this student who'd just broken up with her, as a heart break, they're into a brainlock for the moment and hopefully they can work their way out of that. And that sadness, that's all they can think of even, but when they're in love, when they fall in love, they're also in brainlock but that's a pleasant, you know, that everybody get started of hearing about it, you know? I mean, worst person at the bar apparently is a is a person who's just fallen in love because they tell the story again and again and again and everybody wants to kill him after a while, you know? So, ah, anyway 

01:35:40
ALLEN IVEY So what is the fear system? 

01:35:45
DR. JOHN RATEY Well, the fear goes along with the- 

01:35:45
ALLEN IVEY You go me changing my language. 

01:35:45
DR. JOHN RATEY  Yeah, yeah. You know, I understand, and, fear is 

01:35:50
Fear and CBT 

01:35:50
DR. JOHN RATEY - is a response of the, of, again of the amygdala. I mean, when I see fear and aggression as being part of the same deal and, and anxiety and, and aggression as one to response to it. Uhm, but fear is, is, again, sort of, uhm, has been called by others these days as a, ah, especially a rational fear, uhm, is a learning problem, is a learning disability, that they can't learn anything but the fear response. 

01:36:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh-hmm. 

01:36:30
DR. JOHN RATEY They can't learn that it's safe. For instance, people being afraid of going on a plane. Ah, they can imagine what it's safe. They can't believe that it's safe, and so what you do is you desensitize all the time and you approximate and you extinguish -- you really don't extinguish. What you do is you re-learn, you teach the brain a different scenario again and again and you practice like Joe Montana, like we are talking. You practice the positive scenario, the positive response. 

01:37:05
ALLEN IVEY So, there's a lot of strength in the cognitive behavioral approach and, ah, flight anxiety, flight fear, I think, of Woopy's(ph) desensitization and variations of it. So, that basically it's almost back to what we've been saying consistently, get the patient client moving. 

01:37:20
DR. JOHN RATEY Right 

01:37:20
ALLEN IVEY  Now, positive motions- 

01:37:25
Positive emotions 

01:37:25
ALLEN IVEY - I think the riskier, you have a different process, I understand. Ah, the main component seemed to be physical pleasure, develop a positive emotion -- just physical pleasure, absence of negative emotion and meaning, which means frontal cortex action, this leads, ah, I understand, the dopamine rush, no man lasts as long as the neurotransmitters flows, I'm reading it here of course. Ah, so, what about positive emotions? Coz they don't seem to be as very -- is deep, ah, how are they fit with amygdala? Ah,- (crosstalk) 

01:38:00
DR. JOHN RATEY Well, they are part of the amygdala, too. But for a longest time - (crosstalk) 

01:38:00
ALLEN IVEY (inaudible) they found in amygdala. 

01:38:00
DR. JOHN RATEY - the longest time, that's just recent history. The longest time it was all about fear and anger. They make (inaudible [01:38:11.946]). It's just the, the fear button, but it's a survival button. And positivity meaning or achieving meaning, achieving love is part of the survival network. So the amygdala is involved in pleasure and in excitement and in love, but where it really gets to in the, the sensation- 

01:38:35
Nucleus accumbens - the pleasure center 

01:38:35
DR. JOHN RATEY - and pleasure, that area of the brain is a little bit beyond the amygdala and sort of the gateway to the frontal cortex, the area of the hypothalamus which has everything to do with our hormones, and, ah, a little button area called the nucleus accumbens. And it's, ah, it's sort of the pleasure center. Olds and Milner and 1957 stock electrodes and the rat brains to see where they learn best by pressing the lever and having a little shock going, right? It's up with McGill University and they put it in this one center and the rats that they -- where they put it, it, the rats would press, press, press, press, press until they die because they, they stopped eating, they stopped drinking, they stopped having sex, they stopped running, they stopped doing everything. They didn't do anything except press the pleasure button. And that's where this nucleus accumbens is, and this is our reward, pleasure, sensation(ph), ah, area, and an area that's been hotly studied because, one, it's a very -- for me, it's a very important area for the attention system. And two, it's the center of all of our addictions, and all of our problems with addictive substances, because that addictive substances all work eventually through this little area of the brain that has a lot to do with feeling okay, feeling safe, feeling love, feeling hot, ah, and -- or addictive substances. Ah, most of them cause, ah, a huge release of these various chemicals that, ah, the dopamine is one of them. Ah, endorphins have some roles there, and some of the other newer ones. One is the, ah, the, ah, ah, a new neurotransmitter or a new nerve factor that's an admin(ph), which is something that you find in marijuana, coz there are marijuana receptors in the brain, ah, and that's around our pleasure center and involved with our -- with pleasure. So, all these areas in our part of the feeling that you'd survive, basically, or you're passing your genes on with sex, drugs, and rock and roll, that your -- in your -- you know, you've found somebody, ah, or your -- in the sexual response again very close to the hormones, and that then guides the frontal cortex in a very very positive way then you, then you feel good and then you want to repeat that behavior again and again and again. 

01:41:35
ALLEN IVEY So, ah, it goes Glasser(ph) talked about positive addictions- (crosstalk) 

01:41:35
DR. JOHN RATEY  Yeah. 

01:41:40
ALLEN IVEY - you only need to find something positive to addict yourself to. 

01:41:40
DR. JOHN RATEY Well I agree with that - 

01:41:40
Note emphasis on MEANING 

01:41:40
DR. JOHN RATEY - and I, I, -- that's another way of saying that you have to find the right mission. You have to find something that's organic, that's growing, that keeps you focused on and, and, and continues to provide meaning and growth and development for yourself. 

01:41:55
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, we were lucky enough to meet with Dr. Frankl certainly before he passed, and the whole idea of finding positive meanings and even kind of skirting around that word "meaning" a few times, I wonder, ah, ah, how you put together that word "meaning," ah, with positive emotions or just where do you see " meaning" in this whole (inaudible )? 

01:42:21
DR. JOHN RATEY Oh my! I see meaning as a big part of it. It, it's sort of the meaning drives. I mean, you could see it as meaning driving, the, the, the lower centers, if you will. It, it's something -- and, and connected to the to the, the, the, the drives and emotions and motivation areas. It's, ah, is a huge, huge, uhm, uhm, human construct that, ah, means so much to, uhm, our race and our, our species. It, ah, uhm, it involves, uhm, obviously involves the memory and learning, remembering the, the good stuff and remembering what your goals are, remembering what you want to do, ah, and, ah, so you need all those things working well to, to keep you on the right meaning path. And so, what we say, for instance, in treating ADD people if you, if you can get them into a situation where there have the, the meaning direction provided by their mission or their job or their goal. They don't need medicine, they can stay with it because that's sort of a top-down kind of pool that lights up the whole, ah, attention system. So they arouse. They're, they're motivated. It's, ah, generating. Ah, they're, and they're, and they're on their way. Ah, so you, you see so, so many people who -- I mean I do, who are so successful who have pretty significant attention deficit disorder but, ah, whatever their meaning has been has kept them very focused and they can get over focused which is always the problem. 

01:44:15
ALLEN IVEY Well, that well,- 

01:44:15
Meaning, direction, and spirituality 

01:44:15
ALLEN IVEY - so meaning, mission light up the whole system, ah, and, ah, reminds me (inaudible) said that he or she who has a "why" will find the "how." And, ah, I think that was an important statement to Viktor Frankl. And, ah, we'd been, ah, Mary and I had been writing about discernment, if discerning your life mission. And, ah, that's an area where cognitive-behavioral work is probably not given enough attention although spirituality seems to be entering in. I understand there's a specific area in the brain which lights up around spirituality. 

01:44:50
DR. JOHN RATEY Right, and, ah, you know, there -- I mean, a lot of people have been talking about the, the sort of meaning beyond your, your own existence and that's where the, the ultimate meaning can come from. Ah, and it's something larger than yourself because if you're achieving your goals and this is what I find and probably where you find work with people who had been very successful in their lives. And then there is a -- and then there's -- they're beginning to get into the generative phase, ah, of life. They're, they're not prepared. They don't know what to do. A lot of people don't know what to do, and they need to sort of think about that with coaches or with counselors as to how to put their money or their time or their skills into another meaning direction. Ah, and it's usually something, not just altruistic, but it has a link to something bigger than themselves and I think we were made for that. 

01:45:50
ALLEN IVEY  So we start with neuroscience, and we are talking about transcendence. 

01:45:55
DR. JOHN RATEY Well, I think that's where it comes to, you know, in terms of our own missions. It, it does, ah, really get to that. 

01:46:05
ALLEN IVEY I see we're coming down to about our last 10 minutes and I have not got through my questions. However, they were pretty well. Ah, ah, I have language, the social brain and the care and feeding of the brain, maybe just a few words about language. Ah, certainly, counseling and therapy are language based. So, ah, what is some key points about language for counselors and therapists, keeping in mind we no longer have a full leisure? 

01:46:30
DR. JOHN RATEY  Geez, ah, key points. Well, I mean often times and I think you've alluded to in your own work, ah, you said that it's important to help that person put into words what their feeling or what their missions is or what their meaning is and that's that's one of the big challenges. And for many of our patients, they have a hard time, not only acknowledging their feelings, but putting into words and being able to, to say those words that, that, ah, that will help guide them. 

01:47:10
ALLEN IVEY It's difficult in our materialistic culture to define meaning. 

01:47:10
DR. JOHN RATEY  Yeah, it certainly is. And it's, it's one of the big problems that we're facing as we evolve in this wonderful cyber world. 

01:47:20
ALLEN IVEY  One thing you did say is that talking with a therapist through writing in a journal makes us feel better just by itself. 

01:47:30
DR. JOHN RATEY Oh yeah. When you're, when you're in the- 

01:47:30
Breaking "brainlock" 

01:47:30
DR. JOHN RATEY - brainlock situation, okay, one of the things that happens is the words are all stagnant, that you're, you're just going round and round on how bad things are and by using -- and, and that part of the brain is really shut down. The, the, the language and talking part of the brain, so by, by verbalizing, one activates another part of the brain that may help break the brainlock. 

01:47:55
ALLEN IVEY  So just naming things as really critical, the, the act of, act of naming which in someway, brings I can't really say the accurate naming. I can't help to think of my hero (inaudible) is working multiculturalism and oppression. Naming a person's problem is oppression rather than their own problem seems to be therapeutically helpful. You know, you stop blaming yourself to become aware of system issues 

01:48:25
Dr. Ratey argues that environment maybe even more important than biology. Genes often only are activated in environmental context. 

01:48:25
ALLEN IVEY  I think you had some wonderful writing on what you call the social brain, ah, and, ah, here I say -- this -- I'm gonna read (inaudible [01:48:46.156]), you strike me as a particularly unusual in important psychiatrist, who said, we are not prisoners of our genes or our environment, poverty, alienation, drugs, hormonal imbalances and depression don't dictate failure. Wealth, acceptance, vegetable, and exercise don't guarantee success. Experiences, thoughts, actions and emotions actually change the structure of our brains. Indeed, once we understand how the brain develops, we can train our brains with health, vibrancy, and longetivity. I like this balanced orientation. I mean, that's my summary of it, of course my summary of it picking your words, what would you add to those important statements? 

01:49:25
DR. JOHN RATEY Well, and I think, I think that what I am - 

01:49:25
Connection and wellness 

01:49:25
DR. JOHN RATEY - you know, what is obviously in the counseling work and, and the emphasis, I think is so important especially in our world where we have become more sedentary and more solitary is the connection, and the whole idea -- I mean, meaning connecting to something beyond yourself but also connecting to others. And that's a big part of, ah, -- that gives a big load of BDNF. Ah, when you're feeling connected, when you're, when you're speaking with others, when you're involved, you are not alone. Ah, one of the ways of -- ah, one of the ways we, we stress rats- 

01:50:10
Aloneness and social stress 

01:50:10
DR. JOHN RATEY - these days in terms of stressing, ah, testing out stress in animals is to make them alone, is to take them out of their social group. That is much stress, hormones and all the changes that we see as having them shocking their feet or having them throwing them in water, which they hate because they're not very good swimmers. And, ah the those kinds of stressors that we also use. But, the social stress is by far the more prob- -- I mean, as problematic as, as actual physical threat. It stresses up. And so, when we're connected, when we're involved, ah, one of the, the key points of exercising, moving is it usually leads to you being involved with others and especially with aging, the solitary decline, ah, that occurs, or the, the social decline that occurs with aging because people pull back. They're not as looking forward. They, they think they've done all the challenges that they need to do. Ah, so they don't meet new people. They don't engage- (crosstalk) 

01:51:20
ALLEN IVEY They don't touch. 

01:51:20
DR. JOHN RATEY They don't touch, they don't get out there. Ah, they don't challenge themselves. Well, that's, that's the recipe for brain erosion, for instance, and that's a recipe for sadness and, and loneliness and not being connected. Uhm, and I think that's a big danger and what we're seeing is that we, boomers, are entering that base. We have to be more aware of and, and supportive of that there, there are thankfully more and more awareness of staying involved and getting involved in, in whatever kind of group or, ah, affiliation that you can muster. 

01:52:05
ALLEN IVEY And so, in terms of issues of racisms and sexisms, and so forth,- 

01:52:10
Oppression and the brain 

01:52:10
ALLEN IVEY : - those are, in fact, damaging to the brain. 

01:52:10
DR. JOHN RATEY I think all those kinds of, ah, socio-isolation, ah, they being outside the group kind of thing is a huge, and that's all about survival, that's survival, being outside of the group, shunning, you know? They're all shakers, you know? They shun people and you know that's a very stressful situation and survival challenges of their survival. 

01:52:35
ALLEN IVEY  Dr. Cline who left, ah, their concerned with religions and, ah, they've been very close and suddenly they're alone- (crosstalk) 

01:52:45
DR. JOHN RATEY They're alone 

01:52:45
ALLEN IVEY - and the pain they go through. 

01:52:45
DR. JOHN RATEY  Absolutely, because they're -- they, they had that social group and now, they're, they're gone from it. And it's, it's very high levels of cortisol get -- to get released and, ah, and, and very high stress and anxiety, depression, and all those stuff to call us. 

01:53:05
Chapter 10: Wellness: Care and Feeding of the Brain 

01:53:05
ALLEN IVEY  So, we have time finally for the critical one of caring and feeding of the brain. Although this has been a theme through out and you certainly have pushed, ah, physical exercise, movement and, ah, ah, learning as critical to this, ah, ah, what -- so let's just take this as our final topic and you got your big book "Spark" coming out. Ah, what about this idea of caring and feeding of the brain? Let's wind up with that and how counselors and therapists can help. 

01:53:45
DR. JOHN RATEY Well, I think the big push is, is again this sort of taking off from the social brain is to, is to really help them see the value and improving and increasing their social involvement because that's a great way to care for your brain. Ah, the more connected you are, the more your brain will maintain itself and, and, and be challenged. Actually, one of the things that social involvement does is it challenges you because you have a group of two or three other people or just another person that causes you to respond in a different way than you would be if you're sitting in front of your computer playing solitaire or doing sudoku by yourself or watching T.V. and, and being alone. So, but by being with the group, there's more action. Your brain is involved with action plus there's the affiliation. There's the interest, there's a motivation. There's a novelty. There's all of that that really comes from, ah, the social connection. 

01:54:45
ALLEN IVEY Hmm, ah, so basically, physical exercise, movement, mental exercise, food, ah, spirituality and meditation we haven't talked much about that, Davidson's work, for example, (inaudible). 

01:55:00
DR. JOHN RATEY Ah, I'm a big fan of those guys, and, ah, the, the, the, the whole issue of, of meditation of sort of, you know, getting into the different brain state and, and all. I mean, I think all that is really important and helpful. Ah, it helps to gain balance and centering. And now, I look at centering as a much different than, than just yoga or just, ah, meditation work or, or, ah, you know, it's, it's a physical centering, too, because it, it, it, it really works physically as well as mentally. That's why I think the whole emphasis these days on -- in physical training as a working on balance, ah, not that because when we age especially we lose our balance skills and if you train them up, ah, if you work on it, ah, doing things that challenge your balance so that you get better and you -- where you retain that ability, then you're, you're more balanced in everyway throughout your life. 

01:56:05
ALLEN IVEY  Hmm. And finally, ah, passion. That's in your list. Ah, Viktor Frankl said, mean- -- finding meaning in life can sustain all else, and again, I'm -- particularly (inaudible) talked to you, we start with neurons and we end up with passion. 

01:56:25
DR. JOHN RATEY Oh my, yes, I think that's -- Viktor Frankl was one of my heroes. I grew up in the '60s and his books were big part of my development, and, ah, one of my heroes for sure. And, ah, you know, and, and his whole drive to meaning was what (inaudible) talked, what (inaudible) talked mean, and, ah, the, the, the good stuff from that period that, ah, really never dies. 

01:57:00
ALLEN IVEY Never dies. Ah, Dr. Ratey, ah, I'll shake your hand here. I can't thank you enough for, ah, -- I think anybody can go through a whole book in two hours- 

01:57:10
DR. JOHN RATEY  I don't know that we made it all the way through, my friend. 

01:57:15
ALLEN IVEY But we, we covered a lot of highlights and, uhm, I'm very appreciative of this and, ah, a great learning experience for me. I've updated a lot of key aspects of my learning and I intend to, ah, keep the challenge going and thank you so much. 

01:57:30
DR. JOHN RATEY I appreciated it and I enjoyed doing it. 

01:57:35
ALLEN IVEY Great! Thank you.
