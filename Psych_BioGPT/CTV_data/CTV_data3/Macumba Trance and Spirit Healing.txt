EMMANUEL LOGROÑO Voodoo, Macumba, the very words call up images of malignant which is sticking pins in dolls, are evil sorceress raising devils in dark secret graveyard rites, of naked hysterical black savages holding wild, erotic orgies like vailai(ph). For years these acts were persecuted, but today they have grown to proportions of national religions. Yes Voodoo and Brazilian Macumba are religions with dual African and Christian rules and often work as therapy for millions of people in Latin America and the Caribbean Islands. We shall see something of these afro spirit religions in Brazil where they help white as well as black. Educated as well as unlettered find peace and solace in our troubled modern world.

00:01:50
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO We are in the southeast region which includes Rio De Janeiro in São Paulo. This is the wealthiest area of Brazil, but displays sharp contrast between the rich and the poor. The luxurious condominiums at the beaches are surrounded by sprawling congested slums on the hillside. Unlike like the rest of the country, suffers from spiraling inflation and vast unemployment. Although Brazil appears at first to be a paradise of racial harmony with persons of African, American-Indian and European descent mingling equally. On closer inspection, it reveals great inequalities. In general, people with lighter complexions enjoy higher social positions, while darker persons are poor and of lower classes. Christ the redeemer is a towering symbol of the largest catholic country in the world. Thousands of believers who have faith in miracle cures, visit this lord shrine. People practice a personal Catholicism expressed in promises and devotions to saints. It is often difficult to grasp what spirituality means in Brazil. It is felt in the depth of the soul and represents once worth and dignity. 

00:03:20
[sil.] 

00:03:25
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO Although 90% of Brazilians declare themselves Roman Catholic spiritist religions are an extremely powerful force in the country. More than half of the people participate in them. There are more than 40,000 registered centers in Rio De Janeiro alone. These cults form a continuum from the most African forms to the European type of Kardecian spiritism. 

00:03:50
We are a Catholic family, my mother and all of the children. I received my first communion when I was seven. But my mother had an obsession, a spiritual obsession without knowing anything about spiritism. She had no knowledge of it at all. She had her first manifestation in a church in Pilar, St. Benedict Church. When I was just a child accompanying my mother, the priest said to me "Your mother's case is Macumba." This expression is used by Catholics to talk about black magic, but we didn't understand. Since she was feeling bad, we found a spiritist center. When we arrived here, we found that it was a purely Kardecian center. My mother became a medium and began to work at the table. She was completely cured, today I lead this group. 

00:04:45
[non-English narration] 

00:05:00
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO Spiritism is based on communication with the dead, and the belief in reincarnation. Kardecian spiritism is always conducted around a table where the mediums concentrate and go into trance to receive their spirit guides or protectors. It is based on the codification of a 19th century French school teacher, who is nom de plume was Allan Kardec and whose book of the spirits is still a bestseller in Brazil. Mesmer’s notion of animal magnetism is important in spiritism. He held that sickness and health were controlled by the balance of a universal invisible fluid in the human body. This fluid is felt as vibrations or sensations by people as they go into trance and can be interpreted in different ways. For Mesmer it was a magnetic force in the hands. For Kardec it was due to the actions of spirits and in modern science and medical hypnosis, it is seen as the power of the mind. Yet millions of people still believe in the invisible world of spirits with all of the individual characteristics motives and passions they had in life. 

00:06:10
[sil.] 

00:06:20
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO These mediums are receiving their guides, spirits of illustrious dead doctors, lawyers or teachers. There are also imperfect spirits characterized by malice, envy, prejudice and hypocrisy. Illness or bad fortune is caused by molesting spirits and maybe related to coma or the sense of former life times. The neglect of spiritual obligations, evil eye are the need to develop once medium ship. 

00:06:50
[sil.] 

00:06:55
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO People come with all kinds of problems such as the cerebral palsy, mental illnesses or unemployment. 

00:07:05
[sil.] 

00:07:30
This girl has been spontaneously possessed by a wild Umbanda spirit and needs training to develop her medium ship. 

00:07:40
[sil.] 

00:07:50
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO These developed mediums have already studied Kardec’s doctrine, have received their spirit guides and can limit unwanted spirit possessions. Some mediums can expel the cause of a problem. They take the spirit into themselves and then expel it. 

00:08:10
[sil.] 

00:08:40
You have a message for us. 

00:08:40
I want to get out of the fire, the fire. 

00:08:45
Powerful father of the creator of heaven and earth. 

00:08:50
Jesus Christ, son of our lord people are conceived from the high spirits. 

00:09:00
[sil.] 

00:09:20
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO One or more of the clients present may interpret this problem as his or her own and accept the mediums expulsion of the spirit as a resolution to the problem. 

00:09:35
[sil.] 

00:09:55
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO Believes in reincarnation, possession and the curing powers of magnetic hand passes together with the Catholic and Amerindian elements are all blended into the more African forms of spirit religions such as Umbanda which has been called the national religion in Brazil. 

00:10:15
[non-English narration] 

00:10:25
Umbanda means divine force. The entities who come to posses mediums come to practice charity, the obligation to help ones neighbor. 

00:10:35
[non-English narration] 

00:10:40
Here we practice what we call clean Umbanda, not that Umbanda have the crossroads where they use goats and sheep. We don't do that here. You have already seen that our spiritual mentor is St. Anthony from Padua. He is not only that he is Anthony of Padua and is not that important. He is a saint of the church because when he was incarnated, he had an advanced evolutionary level, all mediums are Catholic. 

00:11:10
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO Catholicism and spiritism do not conflict. Since plantation times the African gods of the slaves were celebrated at the Catholic altars of their masters and eventually they were equated with saint based on similar mythologies and characteristics. For example, St. George killing the dragon with his iron spear was identified with Ogun, an African god of war and iron. 

00:11:40
[sil.] 

00:11:40
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO Along with air conditioned banks and shopping centers with the latest consumer lures are the Macumba shops, similar to botanicas and Hispanic neighborhoods in the United States. They sell plaster statues of the Orisha's the Yoruban gods and goddesses, catholic figures, herbs, cowry shells, glass bead necklaces, alligator teeth and all the paraphernalia you need to perform spiritual obligations. 

00:12:10
[sil.] 

00:12:20
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO The major Umbanda supernatural entities are also present, the Indian. The old black slave and a prankster Ezhu. The last one is an ambiguous spirit representing both good and evil who has a female counterpart in the central bombagida. 

00:12:45
[sil.] 

00:13:00
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO The mixture of Catholic and African elements is seen in this celebration on the birth date of Saint Cosmos and Damian. They are equated with the African twins Ibeji. Children receive candy on this day and Umbandas deposit their offerings candy, cakes, rum and flowers. 

00:13:20
[sil.] 

00:13:45
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO In the Copacabana section of Rio De Janeiro three generations of the same family participate in Umbanda ceremonies, Mosier(ph), a lawyer, his daughter Bejie(ph) a school teacher and her husband Raul a bank clerk have busy lives. Three days a week they go to the Umbanda center Raul and his family have been participating for more than 30 years. He met Bejie(ph) and they will marry in the center. 

00:14:15
[non-English narration] 

00:14:20
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO Mosier(ph) began his medium ship just 10 years ago, when he gave some friends who lived to the center and while there was spontaneously possessed by his Indian guide. 

00:14:30
[non-English song] 

00:15:15
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO The central ritual activity begins when mediums go into trance through stimulation to all of their senses from the music, incense and intense concentration. The mediums are receiving their strong and forthright Indian guides who like to smoke cigars and drink Kashaza, in Mosier(ph) own words. 

00:15:40
MOSIER (ph) There is consciousness, the Indian is completely conscious of everything we are doing our say. He transmits through us a greater force then our own. We don't have the strength to do what we want to do. We are at the command of another consciousness within us that makes us do certain things which are not habitual such as smoking cigars. 

00:16:05
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO The music is playing for different Orisha's or African gods. Each medium has his or, her own Orisha protector. Mosier(ph) is son of Ogun, the god of war and Beje(ph) is daughter of Yemanjá the goddess of the sea. The possessions take place in an orderly passion. First the chief receives his Indian guide next the mediums with the high status and then the less experience mediums and novices everyone is possessed by Indians simultaneously. 

00:16:40
[sil.] 

00:16:55
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO Some people may experience visions, hallucinations or clear buoyant phenomena and be encouraged to develop medium ship. They are told to attend sessions regularly, first they are given a physical exam by the doctor who works in the center. If they are in good health, they are taught to go into trance. This is one of the principle induction techniques. 

00:17:20
[sil.] 

00:17:45
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO Applying the understandings of hypnotic trance of doctor Milton Erikson and his colleagues Hilton Lopez and David Akstein to the trance dancing. Mediums learn to function at multiple levels of awareness, liberating depressed emotional tensions and breaking habitual patterns, subconscious thinking, which may often lead to healing, creativity and personal growth. Together with group support and prestige in the group, these mediums make a new way of life. 

00:18:15
[sil.] 

00:18:40
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO The awkwardness shown at the beginning disappears as novices practice going into trance and receiving their spirit guides. 

00:18:50
[sil.] 

00:19:15
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO Some mothers may look if scared as children participating in these activities, fearing contamination by evil influences or lose of control. On the contrary, children learn to enjoy these ceremonies, most importantly they learn to go into altered states of consciousness in a supported setting, which in the future can help them, if they should get sick or have a problem. 

00:19:40
[non-English song] 

00:21:05
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO The second major supernatural entity in Umbanda is the old black slave. As Benjamin, the spiritual head of the center takes his place on a low bench. He receives his Papa Roberto who likes to smoke a pipe and sip red wine. The old slaves are known for their patience, indulgence and gentle fatherly scolding. 

00:21:30
[sil.] 

00:21:35
MOSIER (ph) Coming out of (inaudible ) my guide is a noise, you know fall to the floor and the knees with one inside the other. He beats the floor twice with the hands open and three times with the hand closed. They are strong blows, even violent enough to injure them. With this the recovery is complete. 

00:22:00
[non-English song] 

00:22:15
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO The other mediums are being transformed from Indians to old slaves. 

00:22:25
[non-English song] 

00:22:40
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO In contrast with his possession by the Indian, now Mosier(ph) is conscious of nothing, not even of the lines people waiting to consult Papa José(ph), his old black slave for diagnosis and treatment of illnesses and for his advise on such problems as how to win back the land remain or get jobs. 

00:23:05
[non-English song] 

00:23:15
MOSIER (ph) I don't like to call these consultations because we are not doctors. We simply give advises to what people should do to better their spiritual and material lives. They look for jobs and they don't know what to do with all this desperations we are experiencing today. So we raise their morale. The old blacks have this objective, since they are very much alike to the material world. 

00:23:40
[sil.] 

00:24:00
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO While people are consulting the old blacks, the third major entity in Umbanda appears. This is the child entity equated with the Ibeji twins in the African pantheon and Saints cosmos and Damian in the catholic pantheon. Earlier we saw the offerings to this supernatural entity on the beach. This other self displays the innocence and playfulness of the child and loves to eat candy. 

00:24:30
[sil.] 

00:25:10
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO This youngster enjoys his meeting with Papa Roberto with the same exuberance an American child would feel visiting his indulgent grandpa. The comforting warms and patience of the old slaves provide solace from the stresses and everyday life. 

00:25:30
BEJIE (ph) I feel that weight, such a heavy weight that once I'm on my knees as much as I want to I can't get up. Its like I'm carrying something on my shoulders, although the possession of the old one is easy coming out of it is a horrible thing. I think that my head will leave my body, I begin to feel weak. Now the children are another story they just say good bye. With the Indian, the entrance and departure are equal. We feel tired physically but with the rested head. I have the impression of it being a little like a catharsis you know you get everything bad out and bring within a great deal of peace and tranquility. 

00:26:15
[sil.] 

00:26:35
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO Often advice can be offered and be followed with less resistance during the possession by a guide. Mosier(ph) can interact on another level with his daughter and grandson making him more effective in getting them to follow his wishes. 

00:26:50
[sil.] 

00:27:00
[non-English song] 

00:27:20
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO Mosier(ph) has been in trance for more than eight hours, although you have seen only a small part of it. During this time, his black slave Papa José has given advice to 100s of people, helping to resolve their problems. 

00:27:35
[non-English song] 

00:28:15
MOSIER (ph) The possession of the old black leaves a person very well, in spite of it being slow and difficult for the medium it leaves that person feeling very real afterwards. 

00:28:30
[non-English song] 

00:29:00
MOSIER (ph) The possession by the old black makes me feel very differently from the one by the Indian. In a possession by the old black instead of feeling vibrations in the upper region, I feel it in both of my legs. My legs begin to get cold and a kind of pain comes into the knee and ends up knocking me on the floor. Upon feeling knocked down on the floor I'm nearly unconscious. I don't have the ability to reason to talk for myself, to know people. I have a certain lack of consciousness my work as the old black. 

00:29:45
BEJIE (ph) The two possessions are totally different, not at all similar for example with the Indian, the hand begins to tremble, tremble, it keeps trembling, trembling, trembling until I feel the vibrations and fall to the knees. With the old black I don't feel anything then it seems that I turn off them, ba… ba… I'm on the floor. 

00:30:15
MOSIER (ph) As for coming out of the old black, it is very difficult. It really hurts when he leaves the medium after you feel a pleasant sensation, as if you would come out of a sauna, you feel very tranquil, serene without pain or preoccupations. 

00:30:40
[sil.] 

00:30:45
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO The fourth major entity in Umbanda is Ezhu(ph), who is often associated with the black magic or the devil. 

00:30:55
[sil.] 

00:31:00
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO This medium on the floor has capture the wicked Ezhu(ph) who was possessing this client in order to expel her problem. This ambiguous spirit can represent good or evil it maybe the spirit of someone who committed suicide or led a wicked life(ph) and hangs around(ph) making mischief for everyone. Or as in the case here there are good issues who have the power to expel the bad ones. Issues favors are sort after because it is he who opens and closes the doors of destiny. 

00:31:40
[sil.] 

00:32:00
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO This Ezhu(ph) is the guardian of the cemetery, identified by his hands. The female counterpart of Ezhu(ph) is the cretaceous Bombagida who likes perfume, flowers and jewelry and makes off-color jokes and sensual offences. Possession by her permits the traditional Latin American woman to behave in way unacceptable in everyday life. Bombagida may also possess a man making it acceptable for him to play a female. 

00:32:35
[sil.] 

00:33:25
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO A client may also be spontaneously possessed by Bombagida which allows her to indulge in erotic enticing behaviors. 

00:33:35
[sil.] 

00:33:40
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO Her Ezhu(ph) was expelled, but she will be encourage to develop her medium ship. It has been said that the sensual and aggressive prankster Ezhu's(ph) together with the stern and fort light Indians, the patient and indulgent old slaves and the playful and innocent children provide a well rounded personality. 

00:34:05
[sil.] 

00:34:20
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO The beliefs and practices of spiritist religions are used by some medical professionals with their patients and seem to produce beneficial results. Some of the doctors are spiritists as themselves and belong to a movement of Spiritist Medicine in Latin America. These doctors believe that 90% of mental illnesses and many other problems are spiritually caused, therefore they use spiritist techniques in their therapy. 

00:34:50
[non-English narration] 

00:34:55
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO One such doctor is Ilias Ermenidis(ph), a psychiatrist trained in medicine in Bahia. He is treating 20 patients here with spiritist techniques, they are suffering from epilepsy, schizophrenia, drug addiction and other illnesses. 

00:35:15
[sil.] 

00:35:20
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO He begins with a series of exercises to induce trance many of which you saw in Umbanda. His technique is called de-obsession as in Kardecian spiritism. It permits mediums or sensitive as he calls them to capture the patients problem and expel it. He claims to treat epileptics without medication using this technique. According to Ermenidis(ph) psychosis is a permanent trance, we take them out of uncontrollable trance and put them into physiologically controllable trance. 

00:36:00
[sil.] 

00:36:30
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO This 25-year-old boy has been diagnosed as schizophrenic drug addict. He has spend the last ten years in and out of the mental hospital, he use to go into periodic rages and break everything in the house. 

00:36:45
[sil.] 

00:36:50
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO This medium receives the spirit causing the boy's aggression. 

00:37:00
[sil.] 

00:37:15
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO The therapy is like an ethno drama where the different negative forces of the boy's personality the aggressive, the self destructive, the hurtful are acted out before him and then banished symbolically. According to the boy's mother, he was an animal and after spiritist therapy he became a human being. 

00:37:40
[sil.] 

00:38:20
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO These religions have recently moved into American cities like New York and Miami. 

00:38:30
[sil.] 

00:38:35
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO Donia Hulia(ph) is a spiritist who came to New York city from Puerto Rico nearly 40 years ago. She still preserves the spiritist traditions and the privacy of her own home where family and friends come to consult her for all kinds of problems, nervousness, alcoholism, marriage difficulties as well as physical complaints. This client is consulting her about his difficulties in sleeping and his problems with his wife. Her spirit guide tells him that he has an obsession and that he will be rid of the evil and melancholy. She advices him to stay with this woman as god has united them. The guider shows him that no one but god can speak in his mind. 

00:39:30
[sil.] 

00:39:35
The doctor gave me the pills, I took them, but those pills the doctor me didn't do a thing. The only thing that worked for me was what you did. 

00:39:40
On that occasion my husband had what's going on with this women you know and for me, for me, I mean my belief is that you know there's a lot of evil and most of the evil people deal with some kind of powders, you know and for me the woman had put the, the evil in my husband's pocket, you know for me to tranquil it in my apartment not anything like nothing just flying in(ph). I look like, like a… like a crazy person. You know, I'll comb my hair or anything and I came here when I went out of here you know I can pale and other when I went out of here I was nice and pink you know natural, natural pink and I felt beautiful that's it. 

00:40:30
[sil.] 

00:40:35
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO As in Brazil mediums are possessed by spirit guides of African-American-Indian oriental and European descent. Only the names differ, for example instead of old slaves they are called Mahama(ph) or Combos(ph). 

00:40:50
[sil.] 

00:41:05
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO In this houses with ward of setting people can go into trance and play out yourselves thus practicing self help program to cope with their thoughts. 

00:41:15
[sil.] 

00:41:50
EMMANUEL LOGROÑO We have tried to show that Afro spirit religions are not witchcraft, but important cultural expressions of history which provide therapy for millions of people and their techniques are already being integrated by some therapists.
