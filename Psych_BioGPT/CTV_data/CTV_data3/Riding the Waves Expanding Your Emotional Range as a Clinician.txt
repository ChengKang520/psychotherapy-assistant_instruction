RICH SIMON Well, welcome, everyone. My name's Rich Simon. I'm editor of "Psychotherapy Networker", and I'm your host for this series, "Who's Afraid of Couples Therapy? So, what we are, we've been doing in this series is really exploring the challenges of being a couples therapy and some of the ways, some of the things about couples therapy and the emotional intensity that one often finds in couples therapy that can make it challenging for so many of us, particularly those of us who are steeped in the individual therapy tradition. So, we're very fortunate today to have a couples therapist, someone whom I've known for 15 years and who, in my view, is about as comfortable with all the twists and turns of couples therapy and all of the intensity and all the emotionality of couples interactions than anyone I know. And so it's my great pleasure to introduce today's guest, Hedy Schleifer. Hedy from, from Miami, Florida. You look very sunny. Welcome. 

00:01:20
HEDY SCHLEIFER Hi, Rich. 

00:01:20
RICH SIMON So, I just want to let, let the audience in on my experience. As soon as I knew we were going to do a, a series on who's afraid of couples therapy, I thought of you. And I remembered a particular experience I had, my wife Yetta(ph) and I were at a couples weekend with you, and, uh, you did a, an exercise with the group that was about as intense an experience that I have ever had, not only in a workshop or in therapy, in my marriage and in my life. Uh, can, can you describe what it is that you did and how you used that kind of, uh, intense experience in the context of what you're trying to accomplish in therapy. So, so why, why don't you give people a sense of what, and, and fit this exercise into the context of how you use it. 

00:02:15
HEDY SCHLEIFER Okay. Well, I did this exercise, if you remember, well at the end of a workshop where we builded the intensity of the connection. 

00:02:25
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. 

00:02:25
HEDY SCHLEIFER And so, every, ever y exercise that was there was meant to bring you into deep encounter with each other. And, the, that realm, that realm of the encounter was building up in the workshop. And as a result, my belief then is that we really become aware together of the, of the web that holds us. So, at the end of the workshop, I am quite confident to do what I did. And I'm going to tell you, of course, what I did which is that I gave each couple the following sentence. And explaining that in life as a couple, we, we are most afraid of losing one another, uh, our mortality. And we're afraid to let ourselves deeply deeply love each other because there's always that sense of the more I'm gonna love you, the more I'm gonna lose, were you the first one to die. And, given that in a couple relationship, we will go through illness, we will go through scary diagnosis, we will go through many things that bring us to that, to that edge where we actually are literally afraid I will lose my partner. And if we don't know how to enter the realm of, and I'll say the sentence, if I never see you again, what I want you to know is. If we can't enter that realm, then these types of events in our lives actually aren't lived fully. We will, we will withdraw from connection because we don't know how to say what we would say were I never to see you again. And so the sentence I gave all of you was to actually sit very close, to really deeply look into each others' eyes, and with the connection you had built up over the weekend to then say, "If I never see you again, what I would like for you to know." 

00:04:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. I, I still, I just got a wave. I was back there. It just, you know, imagining that. Yeah. So it's, it's not something one does in the first moment or first session of couples therapy. I think that's, kids don't, do not use this at home. 

00:04:55
HEDY SCHLEIFER No. 

00:04:55
RICH SIMON Without asking permission. Yeah, and that was... 

00:05:00
HEDY SCHLEIFER The point I want to add here is it's not just that I trust the couple connection at the end of that workshop. I also trust, as I said, the web that was built that holds us as a safety net. So, we're in a community of practice in a sense, a community of practice being a couple. And in that community, I will then trust myself when I sense the community is alive and well to enter that domain. 

00:05:30
RICH SIMON Cuz, as you say that, what, the other thing that I felt that, because we went off separately to, to do this, this say that, have that experience. And just the awareness that, this wasn't just us, it was just our own, uh, vulnerability, our own mortality that was part of that, but that was, that this was a shared experience that you as a concept, I guess, you have of the reweaving the web of life, the web of... 

00:06:00
HEDY SCHLEIFER Exctly 

00:06:00
RICH SIMON And so, if I'll bring much a part of that in that weekend. Okay. 

00:06:05
HEDY SCHLEIFER Exactly right. 

00:06:05
RICH SIMON So, maybe we'll get back to that. I just wanted to sort of get people to have a sense of you and you, the stakes, the emotional stakes that, that you're capable of, uh, of, uh, of playing for, that level of intensity that you as a therapist, uh, feel comfortable with and what makes that possible. We can talk about this a little bit further down the line. But, in terms of for today, I think part of, uh, what my, may be a place for us to start is that you aren't always, uh, a Hedi Schleifer and someone who felt, uh, that that's a kind of exercise that you can be a leader of with a group of couples, and that you did not pop out of the womb as a couples therapist, although seeing your work, sometimes people might think that you had. Uh, so that you began, really began as an individual therapist, and this did not immediately come together for you. So talk to us a bit about how you, how you started and your discovery of couples therapy. 

00:07:10
HEDY SCHLEIFER You know, it's interesting how the personal and the professional weave, because I started out as an individual therapist, but kind of a generalist. You know, I saw families. I saw couples. And, uh, I didn't like working with couples. I found couples threatening, and of course it sat on my own marriage in which I didn't know to live the intensity I wanted to live. I knew to live the intensity in individual, in individual therapy. That's where I had the intensity I love. In my marriage, I didn't know how to really enter it. And interestingly enough, what made my husband and I turn a corner was a first experience which was Huey's(ph) heart attack at age 48 and a quadruple bypass. And the understanding that there was a lot about life we had not faced either individually or as a couple that he suddenly was attacked by his heart, meaning there was a lot we needed to open up together heartwise. And that was the beginning of our deepening our connection, but also the understanding that the heart needs to be wide open. And it began a journey of opening the heart in our relationship. That still did not help me with couples. I, I was still quite lost. How do I structure the couples work. I understood now, I really am ready to have couples open their heart wide to each other because we were doing that in our own marriage after Huey's heart said, "I'll attack you if you don't open." So, that was a really, a very powerful turning point. And then the next one was getting to know a marital therapy and theory and the relational paradigm. And within that, we for the first time had a structure that was amazingly helpful. And I continued to develop my understanding of the relational paradigm with the continued development of what I now call the three invisible connectors, which is the relational space that was described by Buber. The bridge between the two worlds that we are. We are two completely different worlds with two languages, two cultures, two rhythms, and how to cross the bridge to the world of the other, to honor that space. And then ultimately, and that also is a Buber concept, the encounter which is, you could say, biologically is limbic resonance, but it's much deeper than that. It's that wordless domain where we feel thoroughly connected where there are no boundaries, and yet your individuation, uh, intentionality is completely there. So, it's, it's hard to put in words really, but we all know that domain. And so I went from not knowing couples because I didn't know my own couple to knowing couples from knowing our own couple, not having a structure to entering a structure and ultimately arriving at what I now call encounter centered couples therapy. 

00:10:40
RICH SIMON Okay. So, let's slow down a bit. And so, let's talk at the nuts and bolts levels. SO, when you were doing this initial work, and you were just discovering your own couplehood and you were moving from primarily an identity as an individual therapist, and then you started doing Imago work. So, if I was watching what was going on in these couple sessions, what would I have seen? What was the big, what was the difference moving from one, one kind of way of working to the other? 

00:11:10
HEDY SCHLEIFER I think that a very big difference for me was going from being very drawn into content and being a manager of the content and sometimes getting into complete desperation about the content and sometimes even recommending the couples to leave each other because I couldn't handle their content. That's all extreme. To actually for the first time taking a step back, sitting on my chair having the couples face each other and beginning to see that I was teaching a process. And it's that process that has evolved. But, the big shift was that I am a guide. I am a coach of a certain kind of process that I would like the couple to embrace. And of course, there are different kinds of couples. They embrace it in different ways. But, that is what I am presenting to them, the possibility of now entering content through a process, and I manage the process. They manage the content. And so I am not in their content ever again. It is really a very comfortable position as a therapist to be able to then watch as the content emerges, unfolds, develops, and to be able to assist in deepening what goes on, amplifying, deepening, but never inside. So, that's a big difference. 

00:13:10
RICH SIMON So, just so people who may not be familiar with the Imago process, uh, why don't you describe, uh, the fundamentals of that, that process and how about, how that characterizes what you do. 

00:13:25
HEDY SCHLEIFER The first thing that I want to say about Imago relationships theory, that is very relaxing for a couple therapist is to know that only the most incompatible people are going to make a couple. And, the couples are people who can at least give each other what each wants the most and are chosen at the unconscious level to wake up the worst relational nightmare. So, just in knowing that, you know that every couple is going to come to you with a nightmare. You can already relax. If there's a nightmare, they're a couple, and they are (crosstalk). 

00:14:05
RICH SIMON It's a reassuring assumption to make for you. 

00:14:10
HEDY SCHLEIFER In terms of the theory. Now, in terms of the process, uh, I have now evolved the process into introducing couples to the three invisible connectors. I introduce them to the relational space. And the way I introduce them to the relational space is by having them have a 13 minute horrendous conversation about their most difficult, loaded, embarrassing issue. And when they then externalize and look at themselves and see what just happened, they themselves describe a polluted space. So, I am not the person who introduces the concept. They do through the description of their worst dance. But, once they show me the polluted space, I can then say, "Your job as a couple is to honor that space." 

00:15:10
RICH SIMON So, how might that go. So, so if you were to give us an example of what a couple might say in that first stage. 

00:15:15
HEDY SCHLEIFER So, in, in my structure it's already a second stage because I will have them dream about the ultimate they want in relationship. But then I will invite them to have their worst conversation. And so what happens, it could be the conversation about the affair. It could be a conversation about sexuality and how it absolutely doesn't work. It could be a conversation about money, the children, their in-laws, that conversation is that horrible conversation that couples have. I give them 13 minutes, 13 because in Hebrew 13 is love, and it's also one. So, it's unity. I chose 13. After 13 minutes, I go stop. 

00:16:00
RICH SIMON That's the bar mitzvah moment, that 13th moment. 

00:16:00
HEDY SCHLEIFER That's the bar mitzvah moment. I hadn't thought of that. Then I have them look at that couple from the outside as if they were sitting from where I was sitting and saw that couple in a restaurant, but they don't know their language, because this couple comes from another planet, speaks another language. And I have them just describe the process they saw. So the planet is called Wygelia(ph). It's, there's a Wygelian man. There's a Wygelian woman. And the couple suddenly enters into the realm of metaphor. The man seems to be holding back from arrows that are coming at him. He's built a wall. He's got a little window there through which he's looking at the woman. He always keeps looking at her, but he's now behind a thick concrete grey wall. The woman is really sending arrows. She's got a back filled with them, and they just seem to keep going. But at one point, she's exhausted from it. She resigns herself. She pulls away, and that's when he starts looking from behind the wall to see if she's still there. So they are really describing the dance, the survival dance, they've been dancing their whole entire marriage. That's the point at which, and then I say, "What's in the middle?" And they'll say, "Broken arrows. There's a fire starting. There's a vortex sucking all the energy." Meaning they will describe the spacing between without me ever having said a word about it. That's when I introduce the idea, the Buberian idea of the sacred space between people that once we honor that space, we can emerge and unfold as the potential we are as a human being. If we don't know about the space, we will automatically pollute it. And usually what does happen is that in danger, one energy grows big and one energy becomes constricted. And the couple themselves will actually describe that. She seems to be going on and on, those arrows are coming out. He seems to get smaller and smaller. He's like, like a little dwarf behind his wall. So that you, I can then explain these pollution that happens through that dynamic of the maximized energy and the minimizing energy. I can then describe the space, the responsibility to keep it sacred. I introduce the concept of the sanctity of the space. I then introduce the bridge in the two worlds, and now it's very clear to them they just described their dance. They can see the two worlds more clearly than they ever saw them because it's not with the content inside. It's devoid of content. And then I talk to them about the encounter. Couples always know the encounter. They've had quite a few of them. But, it's an elusive thing. They don't know how to, how it happened. They don't know how to go out of it. They are accidental tourists in the domain of encounter. And so I tell them that with a visit across the bridge, learning how to become bilingual, learning how to learn the language of their partner. Hearing it with new ears. Looking at the partner with new eyes. They will actually be able to honor the space and begin to know how to create the space of the encounter in an intentional way. So, the visit, the way the visit works is that now they've had the experience of being at the distance and polluting the space, I will bring them very very close to each other. I explain that in order to hear well, we have to touch skin to skin, because our skin is also talking. And our, our, our nerve endings as a couple, we have a secret code when we give each other our hands, they will begin to squeeze. The thumbs will start moving. There is a language that goes on between couples that even the person sitting very close to them like I am sitting there will not understand and will not know. It is a domain accessible only to them, but they wouldn't want to miss it in the visit over the bridge. And so, I have them actually hold hands. And for some couples it's, "Oh, finally." For some couples it's, "Ew. I can't touch you." But, I'm dealing with something much deeper than a psychological touch. It's actually biological, and it's also very helpful for the creation of limbic residence. So, much research has shown that we remember what people tell us when we are touched by them. So the touch is really important there. Also the gazing. At about let's say, 18 inches, the gazing of our early, early primal times, at birth really and as little babies, when we are real masters at understanding the landscape of the face. And so, I'm telling the couple that they are going to become masters again at knowing the landscape of the face of their partner because from that close, they are going to begin to see how rich that landscape is: the colors, the different expressions. But they will also begin to see some of what cannot be said in words. Waves of emotion that have tears in them. Fear. Rage. Whatever the landscape, the emotional landscape that you can begin to see forming on the face. And instead of being afraid of it, you become a witness to your partner's landscape as you visit. And that's a metaphor I love to use, as you visit a certain neighborhood. So our world is filled with neighborhoods. There are good neighborhoods, bad neighborhoods, tough neighborhoods, scary neighborhoods. There are neighborhoods I don't dare to go alone. I need my partner to cross the bridge so I can go there, because by myself I'm afraid of that neighborhood is out of my own world. So, this is what I'm really teaching the couple once they've externalized their survival dance. I'm teaching them visits to neighborhoods, the various neighborhoods. So, it could be than sexual neighborhood for example. Couples really don't know how to safely visit each other's sexual neighborhoods. So that could be a neighborhood that we visit. I don't start with the sexual neighborhood. I start with a precious neighborhood. And what I mean by that, a place where I feel alive, where I feel good worth, a place in me where things go well. And I start by couples visiting a precious neighborhood because I'm just teaching them how to be present for each other fully. 

00:23:40
RICH SIMON And so as you do, as you do this, so physically you have people who are, when you say they are touching, just describe kind of the concrete detail of it. And then when you, uh, when you began, I think you said earlier, before you get to these troubled neighborhoods you might begin this process with a precious neighborhood. So again, just, if you could just give us a concrete idea of what you do as a therapist and what instructions you give to the couple. 

00:24:05
RICH SIMON Okay. So first of all I bring them really close. I have them touch hands. And that sometimes takes a little time for the hands to work, work it out there. I bring their eyes very close. And I ask them to look at each other with new eyes. I, I quote Marcel Proust, the French poet, that the real adventure of life is not discovering new landscape, but seeing the ones you know with new eyes. And so I have them really look at the landscape of their partner's face with new eyes. And I have them, and they say something like, "Thank you for the journey up to this point." I say those words, but I have them look at what happens to the landscape. Thank you for being my friend through some of the tough things we've gone through. Thank you for being alive in this moment. Hi. You know, so I say some of these things that shift the landscape completely. Sometimes people at that time will begin actually to cry. One person starts crying. The other one, they are not sure why but it's a kind of reunion grief. They find each other again in this wordless space where I'm simply saying you are alive, I'm alive, thank you for that, thank you for being you, thank you for the journey even through the tough stuff, thank you for your courage, thank you for your resilience. So, the beginning of the visit is a, an expression of gratitude for the present moment. And that in itself already shifts the whole atmosphere. There is already there the beginning of the encounter. And then there's a host. One person develops the art of hosting. The other person develops the art of visiting. And in my question to them before I put them that way, I ask them to choose. And in that choice, often some of the patterning of that relationship will come out. Like, he'll say, "Ladies first." And I'll say, "Well, ladies first is not a choice." Or she'll say, "Whatever you want, sweetie." Well, whatever you want sweetie is not a choice. And what's very interesting is that in having to choose to stretch into first of all a choice, secondly will I host you. Will a visit you and make it a real choice. They already learn that a real relationship is about constant choosing. You choose maybe what's hardest for you to do. So, that in itself becomes a very interesting learning. Who's going to be the host. Who's going to be the visitor. And then the host says a very simple sentence. "I'm inviting you to cross the bridge and come to me. I'd like to see something very important to you." I then guide the other person to take this as a moment of learning how to come to be present because your own world, everything in it is the past until now. So you are leaving the past to enter the potential of the president with your partner. You have no idea. You are going into unknown territory. It is the present. And so that distinction between my world, everything in it, every neighborhood, everything I hold dear, my opinions, everything is now already the past. Crossing the bridge is the present. Being with my partner, seeing them with new eyes is the present. And so I often repeat the date. You know, it's November 2, 2011. This moment. Right now. So, there it goes. 

00:28:05
RICH SIMON The present is intruding on this lady. 

00:28:10
HEDY SCHLEIFER So, as the person lands, I amplify this moment of connection. Really to see each other in this moment and then, the other person will take them into a precious neighborhood. What I mean by that is a place that I have really wanted to share with you, where I feel fully alive, where my life has meaning, where things are important to me. And people take each other to very amazing places. You know, I had once a very disconnected couple. And a precious neighborhood for a man was every once in a little while on Friday Shabbat dinner, when everything works out well. And there is a sense of holiness. And he took his wife there, and of course, she had not seen him in that light in so long because the content of their relationship had been so polluting for both of them that having the possibility of visiting together a Friday night Shabbat dinner, the kind of holiness that's there. And he took her, I'll use a metaphor, he took her to every street, every alley and even main square of that Friday night when it is really holy. And the reason to go there first is because they are learning how to be present. I know I'm going to go with them to the toughest neighborhood, whatever that is. It could be the affair. But, to first get to know each other again where they feel alive and where their humanity shines. And what the, what to the visitor does is I say, "You are learning a language. I hear you say, really the words, but to wait until those words have actually penetrated, because you can actually repeat words or you can let words penetrate deeply until you feel that these words transform you. And then you repeat them." And I like the formulation , have I got you? Which is you, subject. Not have I got it, which is it object. Have I got you, you subject. And so, the host knows the visit is done when they have what I call a cellular sense of feeling satiated. I feel physically that you have been with me. I feel nourished. I feel connected. I feel full. And I want couples to begin to know that sensation of satiation that comes from the actual nourishment of the encounter at the end of the visit. So that the sign I'm done is not content to driven. It is physically driven, what happens inside of our bodies when we feel someone is really, when we feel felt. That experience that I think Daniel Siegel describes feeling felt. When we feel felt, what happens in our body? And that's the end of one visit. And then I will do a precious neighborhood on the other side. And that could be, for example, a person taking their partner to their professional life because that's where they feel alive. They feel dead in their marriage, but they feel profoundly alive in their profession. And suddenly their partners sees a landscape they never see because they see the aliveness, the passion, the excitement, the interest engagement that clearly needs then, needs them to be transported to their connection. But at least they know it now. They see, they see it. So, that's the first visit across the bridge. 

00:32:25
RICH SIMON And so, so for the couples, the, you are able, so you're not getting into trouble, troubling material early on. You're doing this. And so, in your experience most couples who come to see you for their first session, this is something with your help in with your structuring, this is, they can make this kind of a visit. With a full. Go ahead. 

00:32:50
HEDY SCHLEIFER I only work now for either a full day or two full days, usually two full days. So I really structure each piece of the, of that encounter with me, and I know I have all the time in the world. I even have the possibility of them sleeping one night and coming back to talk about the main take-home concept that has come out of that first day. So, I've given myself, and that's also an evolution, because I've noticed that as I'm slowing down the work, an hour and a half just wasn't enough. When I went to four hours, well, it wasn't enough, you know. And, so because I do want to get to the place where, that we started our talk with. The place where they could say to each other being held by the fabric of life, "If I never see you again, what I want you to know is." I want to get to that place. And I realized that I am, I am, I'm giving myself more and more time because then I want them to feel held by that fabric at the end of our work together. So it's much bigger than me. It's much bigger than them. It's really the fabric of being. 

00:34:15
RICH SIMON So, the fact that, so people are able to do that out, that doesn't mean that all the difficulties in life are cleared up. So, but they, they've had a different experience I would imagine, most people, most couples I would think, certainly lots of couples. They've never had an experience like that. 

00:34:35
HEDY SCHLEIFER They've never had it. You know, and I think often of the, the four levels of learning, and I'm not sure whose theory it is, you probably will know. 

00:34:45
RICH SIMON Bateson, Bateson. (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
HEDY SCHLEIFER Yeah. Zero, where really you haven't learned a thing. Level I, you've learned a skill but you don't know what to do with it. Level II, you've learned this skill and you can integrate it. Level III is where it's transformative. You will never be the same person again. You have just integrated something where there's a before, there's an after. It isn't a skill you've learned even though you've learned skills. The transformation that has taken place in terms of the learning, and that's why I've waited two days. I want to level III learning. I want to the couple to be able to say there's a before, there's an after. We are not the same. We've tasted something that has us go, "That suffering was useful because we are now different people." 

00:35:40
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. So, what you're, so you are teaching them what that exercise does is it teaches them a possibility. It doesn't mean they stay there. It doesn't mean that they necessarily without you, that they could never get, that they can never really get to there again. But at least they have a possibility in their relationship they didn't have before. 

00:36:00
HEDY SCHLEIFER Exactly. And, the transformation that is internal also goes with them so that they always have in the implicit memory that climate that they internalized. That climate lives inside of them, and that really is level III learning. So, I, I do trust capacity human beings have to internalize a climate and have that in them forever. In order to re-create the encounter they would then have to redo the skills they've learned. Some couples will never do it. But they will never go back to where they were before because they've had, they've internalized something that lives in them. 

00:36:45
RICH SIMON But least they recognize there's an alternative to what they thought was hopeless and, and that they need to repeat it over and over again. So, what is it from that point, so just, you, that, that's, it sounds like you typically in your work, and I can certainly understand this from knowing you, that you get off with a bang. A very, a sharp departure for them probably from what they thought about couples therapy, this terrible thing we have to dredge up the horrors of our relationship. You give them a very different kind of experience. They have this possibility that day, of meeting and having this kind of a visit and going across the bridge. What's the work? How do you think then from that point. So there's a possibility. You give them a direct possibility, an experience of a possibility. What's, what's the work once that's happened for them, and you are hoping they have a new paradigm in mind about relationship. What's the work of couples therapy in your view? 

00:37:45
HEDY SCHLEIFER So for me, the couple, the work of couples therapy is to assist couples to go from their survival dance, from their automatic survival dance, which I call being abducted by the extraterrestrials, because now they know that couple they saw in the restaurant are the extraterrestrials who have got room and board in their home for a long time. It's an abduction. So we moved that from the abduction by the extraterrestrials to the encounter of the souls. Essence to essence, giving each other a chance to create a living laboratory where two grown-ups can become adults. And so the work is having that couple recognize survival dance, and I do write to them the whole script of I call it the Wygelian couple in the diner. I will send that to them so they can put it on the refrigerator. As soon as the Wygelians come to abduct to them, they can scream, "The Wygelians are here." And, you know, they can begin to recognize that there is no content really attached to that dance. It's pure survival, even though the content is very attractive. It's pure survival. So, from the abduction to then the slow work of getting to know one another in old neighborhoods of our world. So Huey and I, after 45 years of marriage have just now designed a new workshop called "The Art of the Sexual Connection". We are ready to tell that part of our story and to invite couples to visit the sexual neighborhoods in various ways, including what we call the toughest sexual neighborhood, because every couple has got also in their sexuality what I call the survival knot. It's the place where there's no energy because one survival pattern meets another. And in this case, one sexual survival pattern meets another sexual survival pattern. So we've designed this visit that opens up the energy there are so we can be creative sexually in that place where at first the Wygelians got into bed with us. It's, exactly, yeah. It's kind of like I see couples therapy as my guiding a couple from that abduction to their intentional, uh, coming to know one another as two very different people, honoring each other's differences, rhythms, language, culture. And as a result of being able to have a real encounter of two very different people. So that's the journey. 

00:40:50
RICH SIMON So, and what, and so this, some couples make that full journey. Some couples don't. What is it, where do things break down? Where do they get stalled? What determines how far along from your observation, both in terms of the couple and in terms of you and what you can and can't do as a therapist, what keeps that from happening, uh, more often? Or what are the factors that limit the journey? 

00:41:20
HEDY SCHLEIFER You know, I noticed that that question relates to a developmental, uh, to, to the developmental stages because couples who are developmentally further along can more easily recognize the Wygelian dance, stop it and go into an intentional I want to know you, let's bridge to each other. 

00:41:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:41:55
HEDY SCHLEIFER Couples, for example, who have been wounded pre-verbally, the survival dance is at that level, so the Wygelian abduction is complete. It's like they don't even know they've been abducted. It's harder for them to go, "Oh, it's those extraterrestrials." because the education with in the sense of I'm going to be annihilated here is so profound. And the, the lack of, of attachment there, so that it's harder to, for that couple it's harder to trust. I can stop that dance, and you will be there. And yes, you are on the other side of the bridge. I, for that couple, I'm all alone and you are going to destroy me or I'm all alone and I'm going to destroy you. That, you know, they are inside of that. And so two days with me do not actually shift. There sometimes even, even a level III transformation. It's still a skill. The skill. See, I know the couple is leaving home with something they can use if there has been a level III transformation. It still a skill, a skill they do understand. They do practice under my guidance, but the level III has not happened. I know. 

00:43:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) or them. Or whatever the language that's not incorporated. 

00:43:30
HEDY SCHLEIFER Right. It's not incorporated. Rarely do I get a couple where it's level I, meaning it is a skill and they don't understand where to put it in their lives. Those couples don't come to see me. I guess my reputation is such you're going to learn such and such. You know, and those couples don't come to me. So it's self-selected. But, I do get couples where I can see that the level III hasn't happened. It's at a level to. It's a skill. They've learned a way, but they haven't been transformed. There I need to work more, and I will invite them. I write couples a report of the two days. They get a report of everything they've done. Their vision, their initial vision for the relationship, the Wygelian dance, the survival dance, the precious neighborhood, the learning how to cross, where was the neighborhood, what does it represent in their life, the toughest neighborhood, where did they go. Now the couple who stays at the skill level will not go to the toughest neighborhood. I can't take them better because it requires that level III. It's on the second day. I ask on the second day, "What was your core concepts you came out of day one?" And if the core concept hasn't been a level III transformation, I can't go to the toughest neighborhood. I'll do other things. There are more neighborhoods to visit, but I won't go to that toughest neighborhood work, which is again very transformational. And couples who go there again feel like there's a before and after. 

00:45:10
RICH SIMON Yeah, so this is very interesting. We had day, a dialogue between Sue Johnson and Terry Real(ph), who are two couples therapists who you know. And so, part of that discussion was about what's, who, what's the role of the therapist. And so, what Sue was saying was that the way she looks at it is the therapist really has this attachment figure. And people are stuck and, and I think there could be a lot of overlap I think of what your account of what happens with couples and hers. And then Terry, and then I turned to Terry, you know, and he does, she does what I will crudely referred to as, you know, female therapy. And he does guy therapy. Crudely, and forgive me, Terry and Sue. And he's a coach. And he's, and he says, I asked him, "Are you an attachment figure?" And he said, "No, no. I'm a coach." And he's helping them to make decisions and clarifying what the decisions are. So, where, where do you come out on that, on the attachment figure, I'm a coach as my primary identity as a therapist? 

00:46:20
HEDY SCHLEIFER You know, I see myself as a guide across the bridge. And I do only that. I don't see myself as an attachment figure. I do not enter their content. I don't have them relate to me. They do not look at me. If they look at me, I send them back to each other. They are each other's attachment figure, and I will make sure that they get to that. I am not that. And, uh, the only time they speak to me is in the beginning when we look at their dreams. And yes, I do cross the bridge with them, and yes they do experience me as someone who sees them, but I'm tough because of their dreams don't match what's, what a marriage is or what life is about, I can get very tough. And I can say, "Wait, wait, wait. You've come to me because you want your marriage and that's your dream?" So, I, I'm, I'm not, I'm not an attachment figure. 

00:47:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:47:20
HEDY SCHLEIFER When I'm done with dreams, people have deeply clarified what they really want. And it sometimes takes a long time because one it makes no sense what they really want in marriage, we will look at that. So, that first piece of the wildest dream gives me sometimes an occasion to be quite a tough person. 

00:47:45
RICH SIMON So when you say, clarify that a bit more, Hedy. So when you are saying, so you'll, you'll confront them. What is it, what is it that you were, you're doing when you're getting, when you're being tough? Just an example of that. 

00:47:55
HEDY SCHLEIFER Let's say, uh, somebody says, uh, "My wildest dream is that my wife think I am amazing." Let's say that's his wildest dream. Well, I will hear it. You know, so you would really like your wife to think you're amazing. Marriage is really not a guarantee that anybody is going to think you're amazing. Your wife is going to learn about you, and she might with time discover that you are amazing, but that can't be your wildest dream, because if that's your wildest dream there is nothing for us to work here. Uh, I want my husband to constantly visit my family and, you know, to feel good with my family. Well, hey, you know, now, peoples wildest dreams, one you start, once you start working with them become actually essential, and they become very touching. It becomes like a poem once people focus in terms of what they really really want. Like the man with, "I want my wife to think I'm amazing." may ultimately come to "I would like to reclaim my self-worth. And I would like to come to know myself as who I really am. And I know that's going to take time, but I'd like my wife's help in knowing who I truly truly am." You know, so we work with that until the dream is something that we can work with, because yes I know she's going to visit his neighborhood. She's going to get to know him. She's actually going to think, I know she's going to think he's amazing after a while. But that can't be a dream. So, I work with that. That's why I start with the dream, because I want to know who has come to me, what do they want. And I don't stop until on the horizon are six dreams that make sense in terms of a journey of connection. Then I invite them to have that conversation, you see. So when they have that conversation I already know who they are in their essence, and I can say quite clearly to them, "these Wygelians aren't you. I met you in your dreams." Do you see that distinction? And that's where I see my role as a therapist is leading people from that survival pattern into their essence. So I start with the essence that I will confront there if I get, you know, makes no sense. Then I go to the pattern. Then I come back to how will you now go to your dream. 

00:50:40
RICH SIMON So that's interesting. As you're describing that because, this is again, this is part of this conversation between Terry and Sue, who really define I think a number of these very central dimensions of being a couples therapist. And they were talking about, uh, Sue took exception to this term, truth telling, uh, sort of when, when you are confronting where someone in your case here, where the dream seems out of relationship to what you think of as a reality that's possible within a couple's relationship. So what enables you to get away with that, because that's a tough, what, to tell somebody, "You know that dream you, you have that you nurture in your heart of hearts." (crosstalk) That's a toughie. So how do you get away with that? 

00:51:25
HEDY SCHLEIFER A look, I've had an affair. My big dream is my wife forgives me completely and we move on. 

00:51:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:51:35
HEDY SCHLEIFER Moving on from an affair is a process. So, I will say I will hear it because I understand why someone suffers the result of an affair and would like to move on. I understand fully. And when I hear it, I hear it with compassion. So, because I'm compassionate, I mean, because I've lived some tough things in my own life. That's why I'm compassionate. Not because I'm an attachment figure. I'm compassionate because I know toughness in life. But, I will say forgiveness is a process. The dream can't be she has forgiven you. Let's look again, what is the dream here. And then, he might say, "The dream is that I can come clean and I can, I can really have her know me where I took another path and with her help enter the path of a new marriage." Yes. In which forgiveness is a part of it. Yes, because I know I can work with that. So, I will look at what can I work with. I, as the guide over the bridge, what can I work with? (inaudible ), like she has forgiven you. What can I do with that? So, I am, I am a guy. And a girl. I'm a guy and a girl. I'm whatever is needed in that full circle. 

00:53:05
RICH SIMON You are whatever is needed. 

00:53:05
HEDY SCHLEIFER In that first piece. To have six dreams that I can work with them towards. 

00:53:15
RICH SIMON So, jumping ahead a bit here with this, when is it done? When do, when is your sense, what happens, what tells you I've helped these folks sufficiently. This is, this is, they don't need to have me as part of their ongoing life. 

00:53:30
HEDY SCHLEIFER You now have shifted that whole idea because I don't know when it's done. I just, I just give them two days of my life. And in those two days they have me 100 percent, and then they don't have me anymore besides the report I will send them which is long. I put everything in it. They can read this report and relive all the learnings. They have a book. I give them a journal, and every junction of our two days I will have them integrate through four learnings were re-learnings or interesting ideas. And so that journal gets filled up in the today's. I write constantly because I'm going to send them the report. They write at every juncture. And again there, I can become a guide if that's the guide is. No, not a guide. Sometimes people heard things that actually aren't what the purpose of connection and that particular visit was about. They'll go somewhere and that means, and I can't think of something right now, but it means something that isn't going to be supportive of their continued relationship. And so I will get in there and say, "Wait, wait, wait, wait. That's an interesting idea you just had." I will repeat it. I will even understand it, but I will say that's not helpful. Take a look again. And then, I will have him or her cross this out in the book and have the new idea that actually is useful for the journey of connection in the book, because that journal continues to be the journal they will be using after the, their two days with me. So they are done with me when they are done with me. You know, I give them what I have. 

00:55:35
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. 

00:55:35
HEDY SCHLEIFER Some people come back. And when they come back, I will go back to the core, to the toughest neighborhood. That's what I do again and again to open that up. 

00:55:45
RICH SIMON That's lovely. I mean, that's, it's, uh, there are so many images that come to mind as you're describing this. This seems like a, uh, a very effective way to catch the imagination of people and this, this domain of relationship that, for, for many people and particularly guys, we don't have a map. And then you are giving us, your, your, you know, it sounds like you're a great coach in giving. You're able to, what, what a coach does is take something, a complicated skill and then breaks it down in ways the person can really envision it. And then you can work on pieces of it and eventually you hope develop it more. So my question to you, and we just have a few minutes left here, so at this stage of development. You've been doing this for a while. Uh, clearly from my view, both listening to you here today and having done a weekend with you and seeing you in action, you really are one of the masters of working with couples. What's, what's the limitation for you as a, as a couples therapist right now? What keeps you from being even more effective than you might be? What's the learning challenge for you at this stage of your career? 

00:56:55
HEDY SCHLEIFER You know, it's very interesting that you asked that question. It's when I cannot assist a couple in firing the Wygelian extraterrestrials. It happens rarely. It just happened. A couple came to see me for my two-day experience. And it was clear that that Wygelian couple was just entering the room from everywhere. I just owned it. I said, "You know, I'm trying to teach you something, but those Wygelians, they seem to have a real grab on you. And what I teach is really to fire them, and I don't know if we can do this together." And then, I don't take your money, you know. You know, it's, it's like I teach this. 

00:57:55
RICH SIMON I see. 

00:57:55
HEDY SCHLEIFER You see what I mean? This is what I teach. And I don't know how to fire those, I, I'm not the one to fire them. You are the one. And they don't seem to want to leave you. You have given them room and board for so long, and they understood that piece. It couldn't, you know, that's my limit. I sometimes can't do it. 

00:58:25
RICH SIMON You can't do it. 

00:58:25
HEDY SCHLEIFER I mean, the, the couple has to be really willing to transition from the survival dance of coping to living in connection. And I won't do it for them, and they decide, you know. And if that doesn't work it's very interesting. Before I had to that one, your question would have been so easy for me to answer, because it's worked, you know. It self selects anyway. People come to me because they know they're going to learn this. 

00:58:55
RICH SIMON That's right, that's right. 

00:58:55
HEDY SCHLEIFER That couple was pushed into this therapy by their therapist who is hopeless, etc. Do this. Hedy is, not a master, she's a magician. Do you understand? I'm not a magician. I'm a master, but not a magician. 

00:59:10
RICH SIMON Yup. Yup. That's great. Well, we are just about out of time here. If, uh, Hedy, is, uh, what's, uh, people want to follow-up with you. They want to, uh, were at your trainings, opportunities to learn from you in various ways. How can they do that? We, we, will they, everyone has a, we'll have a link to your website as part of the series. Are there some events coming up? 

00:59:35
HEDY SCHLEIFER I'm doing an encounter centered couples therapy training in February in Miami. 

00:59:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:59:45
HEDY SCHLEIFER And I'll be using for the first time the DVD, the 10 part DVD that I have created following a couple through the process that I described to you. And so, the training will have clips of that, uh, work. 

01:00:05
RICH SIMON The actual work. 

01:00:05
HEDY SCHLEIFER Of the actual work, and we will then take the therapist through the whole structure. And, the rationale behind it all and my basic three invisible connectures(ph): the space, the bridge and the encounter. 

01:00:20
RICH SIMON Okay. So, people can really get a chance to see you in action. That's, that's great. 

01:00:20
HEDY SCHLEIFER Right. 

01:00:25
RICH SIMON And then, on your, uh, in your website, your, your other kinds of training events and other (crosstalk). 

01:00:30
HEDY SCHLEIFER I'm actually starting, but it's closed now, a master class for three years next week. Therapists from around the world are coming, and it's going to be a community of practice. I was really inspired by your letter about the community of practice, and we are going to work together for three years on encounter centered couples therapy. A laboratory for the relational paradigm. 

01:01:00
RICH SIMON Sounds very exciting. What an experience for, for all of them, for all of you. 

01:01:05
HEDY SCHLEIFER Yes. 

01:01:05
RICH SIMON Now, so, uh, what I would say to our audience, you'll see at the bottom of your screen a comment board. Those of you, uh, this is a, if you're like me, there are all kinds of images and thoughts and connections that have been stirred up by, by what Hedy's had to say and how she's described her work in this, uh, with such a vivid roadmap of this process of couples trying to create a relationship and build their bridge for each other. Take a moment. Your thoughts. If you have some questions for Hedy, she will, uh, she has agreed she will check our comment board. She will not write an encyclopedia in response to each, but, uh, I'm sure she'll be interested to hear your reactions. And that the conversation, this incredibly rich and, and emotionally full conversation that we've had, will continue in the most meaningful way beyond just what's happened between the two of us, but with all of us who have been, all of you who have been listening to this and participating in it in your way, and take it to the next step. Hedy, uh, thank you so much. I, I've been on a long trip you're with you. So, you brought up, I'm thinking my own relationship. I'm remembering what a terrific experience it was to be able to work with you and have all kinds of new ideas about couples thanks to our conversation. Thank you so much. 

01:02:30
HEDY SCHLEIFER Thank you, Rich. I've enjoyed it very much. 

01:02:30
RICH SIMON Take care, and will, and there's more to come in "Whose Afraid of Couples Therapy". We'll see you next time. Bye-bye, everyone. 

01:02:40
PSYCHOTHERAPY NETWORKER Your source for community, learning and excellence Thank you!
