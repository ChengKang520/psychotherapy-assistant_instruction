DIAGNOSING MENTAL DISORDERS

DSM-5® AND ICD-10

NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDERS 

00:00:15
SIOBHAN DOHERTY The brain is the most complex organ in the body. So complex in fact that the Director of the National Institute for Health, Dr. Thomas Insel said that he can't tell us nor can anyone else how the brain functions as an information processing organ. However, given the complex interplay of processes within the brain, what we do know is that even the smallest insults to brain function can potentially impact our lives in fundamental ways. These intrusions caused by injury, disease or other medical conditions can alter the way we behave and our identity. This could progress to the extent that our family and friends may notice that we are not able to live our lives as we once did. We may no longer remember how to make a cup of coffee. How to get home from the store or even the word for chair or we may realize that we are unable to manage complex projects in the way we once could. These changes in cognition are characteristic of neurocognitive disorders. A grouping of disorders codified and defined in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM-5®. 

00:01:30
DSM-5® AND ICD-10 CODING 

00:01:35
DSM-5® 

00:01:35
SIOBHAN DOHERTY The neurocognitive disorders grouping contains a number of distinct disorders, each given its own diagnostic code. The diagnostic codes correspond to those used by the World Health Organization in the International Classification of Diseases or ICD. In DSM-5®, each disorder is first linked to the coding system from ICD-9 with the codes for (ICD-10) listed in parenthesis. Hence all of the DSM codes crosswalk to the ICD codes including the newest iteration, ICD-10®. For example, probable major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease with behavioral disturbance is assigned the code 294.11 in ICD-9 and (F02.81) in ICD-10® which is listed in parenthesis. This is because the ICD-9 system was still in use when DSM-5® was first released. ICD-10® was released in the fall of 2015 in the United States, although it was adopted previously in other countries. However because ICD-10® is now the standard in the United States, this program will be listing the newer code from ICD-10® first, followed by the (ICD-9) codes in parenthesis. It is important to note that for almost all of the major neurocognitive disorders, the clinician should first code the etiology of the neurocognitive disorder followed by code for the major neurocognitive disorder itself. So, in the case of probable major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease with behavioral disturbance, the clinician would first code Alzheimer's disease followed by the particular major neurocognitive disorder. There is however no medical coding for mild neurocognitive disorder. In ICD-10® as well as previous versions of DSM, major neurocognitive disorder NCD is referred to as dementia. However, DSM-5 adopted the term neurocognitive disorder as it can more accurately encompass a wider spectrum of circumstances. For example, while dementia maybe an appropriate term for an older individual who developed cognitive deficits over time, it is an inappropriate term for a younger individual experiencing cognitive deficits secondary to traumatic brain injury. ICD-10® lists their equivalent major neurocognitive disorders in F01 or F02 part of the F00 to F09 block of organic, including symptomatic mental disorders. The equivalent mild neurocognitive disorders on the other hand are listed in G31 for other degenerative diseases of nervous system not classified elsewhere, part of the larger system of diseases of the nervous system. Both of these classifications highlight the inherent connection between the disorders and their etiologies. In ICD-10®, the codes for delirium due to a substance or medication are separated by substance, whereas DSM-5® groups them all under the heading of delirium. Delirium not caused by the effects of a substance is included in ICD-10's F05 block of delirium, not induced by alcohol and other psychoactive substances.

COGNITIVE DOMAINS 

00:05:00
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Thorough knowledge of the cognitive domain is essential in understanding and diagnosing the neurocognitive disorders or NCDs. Each domain describes a different area of cognitive functioning. All of these domains could potentially be affected by a neurocognitive disorder depending on the disorder in question. Some disorders such as Alzheimer's impair an individual primarily in one specific domain such as memory, whereas others may affect multiple domains. We will begin by exploring the cognitive domains and how they maybe affected by the various major or mild neurocognitive disorders. This will help to illustrate the underlying characteristics of major and mild neurocognitive disorders in order to better facilitate diagnosis. 

00:05:50
COGNITIVE DOMAINS 

00:05:50
LEARNING AND MEMORY 

00:05:55
[sil.] 

00:06:00
UNKNOWN Who are you? 

00:06:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:06:10
UNKNOWN Did you want something? 

00:06:10
SIOBHAN DOHERTY There are numerous methods used to categorize memory, each with its own subtypes. Some possible subtypes to consider when evaluating deficits in memory include working memory sometimes called short term memory or recall which refers to tasks such as remembering a shopping list or tracking the characters in a movie. Implicit learning which includes tasks like remembering how to ride a bike or play the piano. Autobiographical memory which entails remembering events from one's own life and the semantic memory which might involve recall of times tables or the name of the current president. With an NCD, a patient may demonstrate adequate memory of one type but display deficits in another. For example, a patient may experience trouble remembering stories from their life while still being able to accurately name the members of their family or recite all 50 states. In neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection, patients are often good with recall but have issues learning new information. Neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease includes learning and memory deficits as well as deficits in at least one other domain. Substance medication induced neurocognitive disorder is more likely to include learning and memory issues if the NCD is caused by methamphetamine use or use of sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics. Learning and memory may also be affected by neurocognitive disorder due to a traumatic brain injury. It is less commonly affected in frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder. The early stages of Hunnigton's disease are also unlikely to affect learning and memory. The clinician should use some form of quantified testing to determine the extent of the individual's performance level in each cognitive domain. In the case of memory, the clinician may ask the patient to remember three unrelated words after having a conversation for five to ten minutes. In conjunction with clinical testing, the clinician may also use testimony of someone who knows the patient well such as a family member, friend or co-worker to determine the duration and severity of the symptoms. This will also be helpful to determine the patient's baseline prior to experiencing cognitive changes. For example, if the patient was never able to recite the times tables then being unable to do so at the time of clinical assessment would not indicate cognitive decline. Prior treatment records can help shed light on the progression of symptoms. 

00:08:45
COGNITIVE DOMAINS 

00:08:45
SOCIAL COGNITION 

00:08:45
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Those with deficits in social cognition will have trouble considering the thoughts and feelings of others. This may manifest in a difficulty to understand the emotions of others through their facial expressions. For example, an inability to infer that someone is happy because they are smiling. They may behave in a socially unacceptable manner and could come across as indiscreet with everything from their choice of a tire to topics of conversation. 

00:09:15
UNKNOWN What do you mean it's not awesome? What do you mean if that's not something fun that is enjoyable, what are you, what are you talking about? This is freaking football, this is what I dedicate my life to. 

00:09:25
[sil.] 

00:09:35
UNKNOWN I'm sorry. 

00:09:35
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Social cognition may particularly affect those with frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder, potentially causing a lack of sympathy or empathy as well as more reckless behavior. 

00:09:50
COGNITIVE DOMAINS 

00:09:50
COMPLEX ATTENTION 

00:09:55
SIOBHAN DOHERTY An individual engages in complex attention when they are actively paying attention to more than one thing or when they are trying to pay attention to one thing for a sustained period of time. Deficits may manifest as difficulty maintaining conversation while in a room with the TV or radio playing or an increase in the amount of time it takes to complete a set of tasks around the house. These individuals may find it difficult to keep newly gained information in their minds. Their thinking process may move slower than it once did and they tend to do best when only taking in one stimulus at a time. In the early stages of neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, the individual's attention may oscillate. This domain may also be deficient in patients with a traumatic brain injury or vascular neurocognitive disorder. 

00:10:45
COGNITIVE DOMAINS 

00:10:45
LANGUAGE 

00:10:50
UNKNOWN I was in the store. You know the, the store from where we get our food. 

00:10:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, the one, the one the (inaudible )most of the time, yeah. 

00:11:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. What's it called? 

00:11:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:11:03
UNKNOWN Oh, of course. Anyway, so I'm going up the aisle where they have the, umm… the cans of what's that food that we use to buy, that… 

00:11:15
UNKNOWN Is that the vegetables or what? 

00:11:15
UNKNOWN They used to… the… umm… the… 

00:11:15
UNKNOWN Or do you mean the, the condiments? 

00:11:20
UNKNOWN No, no, no… 

00:11:20
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Deficits in this domain involve challenges in both communicating and understanding language. The language domain also encompasses grammar and syntax as well as understanding and responding to others verbal cues. These deficits can involve difficulty naming objects or substitution of generic terms such as a thing, or you know, for the name of the object. These individuals could also have difficulty with the names of other people using general pronouns instead. This could escalate to the extent that the individual may utter repetitive sounds, echo the sounds of others or see speaking altogether also known as mutism. Fronotemporal neurocognitive disorder patients may experience difficulties with language similarly those with neurocognitive disorder due to HIV may find themselves less fluent than they previously were. 

00:12:15
COGNITIVE DOMAIN 

00:12:15
PERCEPTUAL-MOTOR 

00:12:20
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Difficulty working with previously familiar tools and trouble navigating one's familiar neighborhoods are just two of the ways in which the perceptual motor domain can be negatively affected. Deficits in this domain entail diminished abilities not only with motor skills but also with visual and perceptual cues in spatial relationships. It isn't that the senses themselves are impaired, only the individual's ability to navigate them. These difficulties become particularly pronounced in darker environments or at night. Perceptual motor decline maybe seen in those with neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease. 

00:13:00
COGNITIVE DOMAIN 

00:13:00
EXECUTIVE FUNCTION 

00:13:05
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Deficits in executive function can involve issues formulating plans, problem solving and decision making. This domain is composed of any process that groups singular tasks or ideas into multiple components. This could be the completion of a project that has multiple sets of decisions, finding a friend in a crowd or tracking a specific conversation in the clamor of a party. Individuals impacted in this domain may not be able to work on complex projects. They will have trouble taking in new information or encountering new situations. This could make them more likely to revert to habit rather than adapt to changing circumstances. The early stages of neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies and Huntington's disease may include evidence of decline in executive function. Those with a traumatic brain injury, HIV or vascular neurocognitive disorder may also experience issues with executive function. When it comes to substance, medication induced neurocognitive disorder, executive function is more likely to be affected when the disorder is due to alcohol or methamphetamine use. 

00:14:15
MAJOR AND MILD NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDER 

00:14:20
SIOBHAN DOHERTY A major or mild neurocognitive disorder entails a decline in functioning for an individual. For any NCD, this decline maybe brought to clinical attention either by the individual or someone who knows them well. The clinician will then assess the extent of the deficits through standardized neuropsychological tests. The collected evidence will support a cognitive decline which interferes with the individual's ability to complete independent tasks. A mild NCD is indicated if the individual is still able to continue their independent life or be it with some difficulties in coping strategies. If the individual is unable to maintain daily activities, such as taking medication or paying bills without significant help and if this impairment is not better explained by other factors, then a major NCD is indicated. For all of the major and mild neurocognitive disorders, the clinician should specify if the disorder is with behavioral disturbance or without behavioral disturbance. This is part of the coding for major NCD but only indicated for mild NCD. For major neurocognitive disorder, the clinician should also specify the severity by mild, moderate and severe depending on the degree of help that the individual needs in their daily life. The etiological specifiers for major and mild NCDs indicate the possible or probable cause of the patient's disorder. We will briefly review each of these specifiers as they vary some in their characteristics. Even as they share the underlying similarity of major and mild neurocognitive disorders including deficits in the cognitive domains. As previously mentioned, Alzheimer's disease primarily affects learning and memory. This cognitive decline sets in gradually. This disorder is indicated if there is a family history of Alzheimer's or if the individual's genetic tests show one of the rare causative Alzheimer's disease genes. There are two manifestations of frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder. One includes behavioral changes such as disinhibition and apathy as well as deficits in executive abilities or social cognition. The other includes deficits in language. However, patients may show symptoms of both types. Around half of people with frontotemporal NCD have a family member with the disorder. Neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies or NCDLB is characterized by repeated episodes of specific visual hallucinations, shifts in the ability to be alert and focused, REM sleep behavior disorder and tremors and other symptoms indicative of Parkinson's disease. NCDLB must be distinguished from NCD due to Parkinson's disease which is determined by the timing of the diagnoses of Parkinson's disease and major NCD. In NCDLB, cognitive decline manifests earlier in the course of illness before the onset of major symptoms. Vascular neurocognitive disorder maybe caused by a stroke or white matter disease. Characteristics include deficits in executive function and complex attention and must be differentiated from other NCDs. Vascular NCD and Alzheimer's disease are the two most common causes of NCD. Traumatic brain injury or TBI is caused by blood force head trauma or another event which impacts or jostles the brain within the skull. In addition to cognitive deficits, a TBI is characterized by amnesia, confusion, losing consciousness and seizures or other markers of neurological effects. In order for a substance or medication to be considered in the induction of a neurocognitive disorder, the characteristics of the disorder must continue beyond the time limits of intoxication and withdrawal. The substance or medication must also be capable of causing the specific neurocognitive deficits. This specifier is coded by substance which includes alcohol, sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytics, inhalance or other substances. Neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection is diagnosed when an individual with documented HIV shows symptoms of a major or mild neurocognitive disorder which is not better explained by another condition. In addition to the neurocognitive deficits of a mild or major NCD, the effects of neurocognitive disorder due to Prion disease include tremor, ataxia, rigidity and jerky movements which are all features of Prion disease. If a patient has already been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and then begins to experience cognitive deficits, then they maybe diagnosed with NCD due to Parkinson's disease. Similarly, if a patient has been diagnosed with Huntington's disease or shows genetic risk for Huntington's disease and begins showing signs of neurocognitive decline, then neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington's disease is indicated. If none of the previous specifiers applies, then the clinician may choose to use neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition. Neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies or unspecified neurocognitive disorder. 

00:19:55
DELIRIUM 

00:20:00
UNKNOWN Delirium is grouped with a neurocognitive disorders due to similar characteristics, a deficit or deficits in one of the cognitive domains. The word is not grouped under major or mild NCD. This is partly because a predominant feature of delirium is difficulty being aware and attentive which isn't as prominent in the NCDs. Delirium also develops over a much shorter period of time than the other NCDs, hours or days as opposed to weeks and months. And the effects of delirium are more apt to be reversible. Individuals with delirium will have trouble focusing or orienting themselves and this disturbance may increase later in the day or evening. They may not be able to maintain attention on a subject for a prolonged period of time or shift their attention from one subject to another. They'll also experience difficulty in one of the cognitive domains. The cause of an individual's delirium determines how it is coded. Causes include medications such as anxiolytics or steroids and intoxication or withdrawal from substances such as cannabis, inhalants or alcohol. Delirium may also be due to another medical condition or to multiple etiologies. The clinician may choose to specify the duration of the delirium whether acute meaning between a few hours and a few days or persistent lasting upwards of weeks. In a hospital setting, delirium typically lasts a week. Additionally, there is the option to specify the level of psychomotor activity. If the patient is slow moving and fatigued, the clinician may specify hypoactive. If the patient is energetic perhaps even to the point of being uncooperative, then hyperactive is appropriate. And if a patient's energy levels change frequently or if the patient is at a relatively normal energetic level, then the clinician may choose to specify mixed level of activity. Neurocognitive disorders as a whole are unique among most mental disorders, in that the physiological etiologies can often be discovered. A thorough understanding of the fundamental characteristics of these disorders coupled with confirmation of an underlying cause through testing can potentially offer the patient the first step in a treatment process. The affects of some of these disorders maybe reversed especially when recognized early enough and treated properly. For those disorders that cannot, the diagnosis and treatment process can help the patient effectively manage their disorder and improve their quality of life.
