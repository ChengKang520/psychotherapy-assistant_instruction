Shades of Black Diversity in African-American Identity WILLIAM E. CROSS, Jr. 

00:00:00
WILLIAM E CROSS, JR.  Good morning. Uhm, have a chance to share some time and some thoughts with you. I'm speaking from Mount Holyoke, ah, Massachusetts, in a lovely, ah, summer morning. And, ah, today, I'd like to speak to you about the issue of diversity in African-American identity. Ah, from my point of view, there are two, uh, shall we say, issues that often interfere with our better appreciation of the diversity of African-American identity, which I would say has always been there. Ah, but in some ways, it has taken a long time for us to empirically and theoretically understand, to incorporate it in what we call, uhm, ah, Black Psychology or, or the Psychology of the African-American experience. 

00:01:00
WILLIAM E CROSS, JR. Uhm, in a sense, we would have to find a way to rewrite the early history of the study of Black identity, and that really is the rewriting of the notion of self-hatred. And secondly, we would have to find a way to revise our notions of the stages of Black identity or sometimes what we refer to as nigrescence. Why would we have to revise that? Well, in a sense, if we take the way, ah, identity is normally talked about in the Black experience, it's a notion that between 1939 and, ah, up until 19, late 1960s, ah, the key issue for discussing Blackness was the notion of self-hatred. Ah, the research literature allegedly said that this was normative for most Black people, that most Black people hated themselves. Uh, and in a sense, if we believe that diversity has always been a part of Black identity, that self-hatred was there but there were also issues of strength, of variability, ah, there, there are other issues in self-hatred, then we'd had to find a way to rewrite that aspect of the, ah, of the literature. 

00:02:00
WILLIAM E CROSS, JR. Likewise, from the late 1960s onward, we are faced with the fact that the, there were models produced, my being one, my, my, ah, being one of the producers, models that suggested that Blacks went from a self-hate, hating mode to a more self-loving mode and that it was only that instance that we moved toward, ah, ah, some variability in the way Black people saw themselves. Ah, here again, that is almost the reverse of the self-hatred notion that's kind of promoting almost a romanticization of Blackness, that, ah, in a sense, we can only achieve a, a sense of self-love if we first go through some sort of process. The fact of the matter is, anyone familiar with literature, with history, ah, have, having done participant observation studies in the Black community, having lived in the Black community, neither of these models capture the diversity of, ah, ah, ah, Blackness that is there today and probably has been there in the past. And therefore, we as researchers, we as clinicians, we as students of the field of, of Blackness, have to wrestle with how can we explain the pre-, the, ah, presence of diversity and identity that probably existed in the past, you know, what way can we talk about that? Giving recognition to self-hatred but at the same time going beyond the self-hatred model, how can we do that in the past? Likewise, how can we approach this notion of developing a Black identity in the presence, present in the, in the context of nigrescence models? How can we do that and at the same time give recognition to the fact that diversity is the hallmark of the Black experience. 

00:03:35
WILLIAM E CROSS, JR. I believe that the answer for this is our understanding that, for any human being, the self-concept consists of at least two important domains: a personal identity doma-, domain, and a reference group orientation domain. A, ah, that is to say that the, the totality of the self-concept consists of, that aspect which is, ah, uhm, not necessarily defined by race, by gender, by religion, in a sense, is dictated on how a person feels about himself at the most personal level. And likewise, there's another part of, of the self-concept that can be considered almost the cultural content, the group identity contech, content, which I refer to as the reference group orientation content. Throughout this talk, I'm gonna make this re-, make reference to the notion of self-concept or LSC, equaling(ph) PI or personal identity and RGO or reference group orientation. The PI refers to the personal identity component, the RGO will refer to the group identity or reference group orientation component. 

00:04:40
WILLIAM E CROSS, JR. With that in mind, let me now try to show, how in effect we can rewrite our notions of self-hatred and we can also rewrite and modify some of our, our notions of the way in which Black people discover their identity in some ways, ah, with, through the nigrescence process. In my book, ah, Shades of Black, I divide it into two parts. The first part is essentially a rewriting of the notion of self-hatred. Let us begin by talking about that. It is a curious fact that we have a literature in psychology which suggests that between 1939 and the late, late 1960s that if you want to talk about Black identity, the starting point for that discourse would be with self-hatred. People usually took this for granted and yet we have this other material coming from sociology and from history that would say, that from about 1945 or the end of World War II, to about 1960, ah, in the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement, we have one of the greatest periods, ah, of working class vitality in the history of Black life. Now, what do I mean by that? Well, after World War II, the GI Bill was signed and many white, ah, males were able to take the GI Bill and gain an education and to move up into the middle class. Well there's, there was not much immigration allowed into the United States and so the work pool of that became extremely value were Blacks themselves. And so, we moved in large numbers into the heavy industry, factories, GM, Frigidaire, ah, tire companies and so on. We were being paid a good buck and in a sense this allowed us to sub-, sustain family life at a level we probably had not known before this time. Ah, this was true in the south but more so even in the urban centers of the south and in north. We now know from other sources of literature that this produced, ah, family life, ah, community life with, which was often very vibrant. The level of crime in the Black community during this time period was manageable. The level of, ah, ah, dope addiction was, ah, manageable. Instead we find rather than these negative in disease(ph), ah, being the hallmark of our experience. Instead we have, ah, in the sense, ah, ah, communities in which there was almost nowhere that you can walk. There was almost no place you couldn't go. Ah, there were, not necessarily, ah, millionaires, but there certainly were healthy businesses at the working-class level. And of course, this is a period when we had some of the children of these, ah, stable working class families moving on into college and beginning the Civil Rights Movement in the, in the mid '60s and eventually the Black Power Movement of the late '60s and 1970s. 

00:07:20
WILLIAM E CROSS, JR. So, in a sense, we have this literature from sociology and history telling us about variability, telling us about strength, telling us about, ah, not necessarily a romantic period of the Black experience, but one that is very healthy, yet we have psychology that tells us that the dominant psychology of these folks was self-hatred. Something simply didn't seem to fit. Turns out, when you go back and you examine the original studies on self-hatred, this variability actually was already there. You don't have to redo studies to discover this variability. So, in the famous doll studies that were done by the Clarks and other people, we discovered the following, that yes, there is some evidence in their data to, to, to suggest that at least some of the children, they were testing mostly children, may have shown some instances of, of, ah, ah, self-deprecation. 

00:08:05
WILLIAM E CROSS, JR. On the other hand, there were other images that were there that suggested that in fact, ah, perhaps, self-hatred was not the only theme in this data. And in part one of my, ah, ah, text, I tried to show how you can re-examine this data without any particularly fancy statistics, just simply examining it with a clear mind, and you discover, yes, there may have been a self-hatred profile but there were evidence of these other profiles. So, number one, the original data on self-hatred is, is called into question by the fact that this data reveals competing images and not just simply the self-hating images. 

00:08:35
WILLIAM E CROSS, JR.  I don't think that, that we should try to replicate the, ah, details of the text here, so let me summarize what we have essentially found in our re-examination of the self-hatred notion. Number one, we discovered that, ah, in the past, too many studies of Black identity were done on very young children. That is to say, studies would be done on children who were three, four, five, or six years of age, and usually around some notion of racial preference which doubted the person like, ah, did they show a color preference. Ah, and then this kind of behavior in very, very young children would be, ah, ah, imposed on the discourse and how we discuss the complexity of Black identity in adults. In a sense, literally, the, ah, evidence from little children would drive our discussion of adults. This should not have made sense for anyone at any time, but, and, the fact of the matter is that is in fact what often drove it. So, number one, some of our distortion on the nature of Black identity, some our failure to discover its diversity, is related to the fact that sometimes we do too many studies with children when in fact we should be doing studies with children, with adolescents, with young adults, with middle-aged adults, et cetera. When one looks at the life span, you discover that simply measuring racial preference, which color do you like and so on, I don't mean to, to downplay that totally, but just simply looking at color preference in children is not enough information for us to understand the complexity of Black identity. For example, on the surface, it appears that you can have some Black children who has measure by their group identity and racial preference, might choose Black, might choose white, whatever. And yet, if you try to equate those kinds of choices with their performance on self-esteem tests, there doesn't seem to be a match between the two. And yet, allegedly, if a child, Black child was, is using white, he or sho, he or she should also measure very low on self-esteem, and this doesn't always occur. Ah, we know this, ah, in one interesting way that gives us some insight into the limitations of only measuring Black identity with young children, uh, on racial preference. 

00:10:40
WILLIAM E CROSS, JR.  You ca-, can discover ra-, very easily in the everyday behavior of Black children, ah, young Black children. But in some instances, they have learned to appreciate both aspects of the white world and aspects of the Black world. So in a sense, they almost have a bi-cultural frame of reference. Yet, these racial preference tests that are often given to them require that they show some sort of mono-racial preference. That is to say, they are expected to show preference primalier, primarily for Black, or of if they, they should show it overwhelming for Black. Well, that's a contradiction to in fact their basic frame of reference. Their, their frame of reference is one that showing appreciation for both worlds. So given a child, given that a Black child is given 10 preferences, in theory, a better match for in fact how they are trained to view the world would be choosing white and of, ah, five times and maybe choosing Black five times in that perticu-, particular experiment. Or if you will, the group of Black children might show more of a tendency to be bi-cultural in their choices than maybe white children might show more of a mono-racial frame. Well, they're, they're not choosing Blacks all, the, the Black all the time. It's not an indication necessarily of self-hatred. It may have be, a, a reflection of their bi-culturality. So, the complexity of the world in which the children live in has to be shown in the fact in how this identity is measured, and typically in fact, these experiments have been so simplistic to begin with that they've almost brutalized the complexity that is even there in the young children. 

00:12:10
WILLIAM E CROSS, JR. But let's take this issue of preference and choice to another level. What happens when talk about using color preference with adults, because sometimes people do that as well. Well, here, we're talking about adults who are often have a very, very complicated, uhm, ah, frame of reference about who they are. They of ten have a cluster image, images about themselves, not that that suggest confusion, by that I mean they may say, "Well, when I'm in this kind of context, this is the dominant role. This is what I stress. This is the identity that comes forward. So in a sense, as a professor, I might show some tendencies to wanting to be a, a very effective professor, and therefore, I may, I might be thinking today right now, not so much about my Blackness per se, but my ability through this medium to communicate very effectively to you. Uh, likewise, if I moved down the street and I go and buy a, a high fidelity shop because I'm in audio file, I may engage myself with the person who in fact is, ah, ah, uhm, ah, talking about tube equipment or transistor equipment. In the sense, I can wear multiple hats. I'm still the same person but I may choose to, ah, stress different things. Likewise, let's take this even more deeply. Let's suppose that I was gay. I'm a Black man but I'm also gay. And do I, I pit one against the other? No. In some ways I may integrate those things, so there are some times when race may be very highly salient to me or culture, if you will. Other times my sexual preference may be highly salient. Likewise, let's suppose I was Black. I am also gay, but I'm also a woman. In a sense, these things now suggest a great complexity. Well, how can a simple racial preference test in any fashion tap into that complexity? It simply cannot. And so, when you look at research that allows for that complexity, you discover that, oftentimes, we have rushed to notions of self-hatred and have literally brutalized and so, totally, just avoid it, the complexity of a Black identity that has always been there, probably always will be there, and that's not to suggest that as, a critical mass of us don't suffer from self-hatred. That's not the point here. There are Black people who do suffer from that, but we shouldn't use that as the model for describing what Black people do in general. 

00:14:25
WILLIAM E CROSS, JR. One of the greatest examples of this complexity of Black identity was, was produced, uhm, in a dissertation, an unpublished dissertation by Julius Johnson in the late 1970s. He did a study of, of about, ah, 55 or so Black males, all of whom were gay, but about half of that sample affirmed being Black first and their gayness was given less significance. Another half made being gay more significant and their Blackness was, was given, ah, less, lesser concern. Now in the old model of how you should predict self-esteem in Black people, those Black gays who made being Black the most salient part of their identity, they should have tested out the highest on self-esteem, on personality dynamics, on strength, if you will. And likewise, the gays who made being gay the most important, they should have tested out lower in self-esteem because somehow they might have been denying their Blackness by stressing their gayness. Well, it turns out that when Julius did his study, ah, he did a marvelous thing. He had a variety of measures for Blackness and he had a variety of measures, ah, for, ah, personal mental health or PI as we wanna call it. And what he discovered is that neither group could be differentiated on their personal identity characteristics, on their PI characteristics. In effect, whatever identity they had going for them, both those sets of identities were servicing them well with regard to their mental health. Does that mean there were no differences between the two groups? Oh, he found profound differences, but it was at the RGO or the group identity level and let me show you the kind of difference, talk to you about the kinds of differences that he discovered. 

00:16:05
WILLIAM E CROSS, JR.  With regard to the Black men who made being gay most significant in their life, they were more likely to have white lovers because in effect they were living primarily in a white community which, ah, stress, ah, gayness. They were more likely to feel more free to publicly display their affection with other men because in a sense they lived in a context where this, this was in fact, if not encouraged, was allowed. These Black, ah, gays who stressed their gayness sometimes felt some degree perturbation, some degree of nervousness when they were in a all Black suit situation. Not so much again because of self-hate, self-hatred, but in a sense, that was not the, the, the situation in which they had the highest comfort level, et cetera, et cetera. On the Black men who stressed their Blackness, they were more likely to have Black lovers. They were more likely to live in a Black community, and therefore, because the Black community is in fact traditionally somewhat homophobic, they were not comfortable with public displays of their gayness. And, ah, they were more likely to experience some degree of anxiety when they were in an all white situation. If you will, let's step back. Their identities were performing extremely important functions in their everyday life. They dictated some preferences, some comfort levels, the nature of their social networks, ah, what they would display and not display, et cetera, et cetera. So, we can't say that they were the same, they were in some ways very, very different. And it is only our ability as researchers to make this distinction between personal identity, self-esteem, what have you, ah, internal/external extraversion, all the things that I mentioned in the book that defined personal identity, versus group identity or reference group orientation. Once we make that distinction, we could figure out how it is that these two men, these clusters of men, who, in some ways looked alike physically, who in some ways, ah, seem to be operating with high levels of "personal identity," nonetheless, have these somewhat radical, ah, differentiations with regard to the functions of their group identity. 

00:18:15
WILLIAM E CROSS, JR. Well, we could go on and, and the point being made here is that Black people have always had a variety of ways in which they have achieved personal happiness, personal integration at the most intimate of levels. In a sense, their personalities have often been formed by a variety of parental styles, by a variety, a variability in their neighborhood's and in their communities and this has reflected in the variability in their personalities. Likewise, we have never been able to achieve total consensus on how we are going to interpret being Black, and that's at the essence of a Black identity. One is physically Black or one, uhm, ah, ah, is defined by the self in the community as Black, and the question becomes, how do you relate to that? In the sense, what, ah, in what way do you refer to that? That is why I like the term reference group orientation. And we have shown great variability in that. And our, our studies suggest that in some instances, not all Black people place, ah, high salience, ah, high significance, or the same degree of significance on their being Black. Some in fact get, more, more out of their identity through their religion, ah, through their lifestyle, ah, through their occupation. In a sense, we probably all find a way to achieve some degrees of happiness, some degrees of personality integration, but that may be driven not necessarily by making race or culture the most important part of our life. That maybe something that you and I might not favor. We may want, we may want more and more Black people to favor race and culture and, and, I'm not, that's not the issue here. It's not what must be, it's what we'd actually discover in the community itself. But once we understand that, we can see where it was impossible for the racial preference studies to ever do justice to the diversity of Black identity that existed in the past, and I say that in the past because these were the studies that were used in the past. So in a sense, that's almost our explanation for why it is that the self-hatred literature is a very limiting lite, literature. It tells us some important parts of, of the Black experience in the past, but quite frankly it probably misses 90 to 80 percent of what was always there. Why was this a case? Why is it the case that we have spent so much time in our discourse on the history of Black identity focusing on self-hatred? Well, there's a bit of irony here. In a sense, we had the chance in the, in the 1950s as, as a community and we weren't doing it alone. There were White allies as well. But in this sense, in our own community, we had an opportunity to do what, to destroy the edifice of segregation. Now one can go back with other lawyers and say, "Well, why didn't they destroy segregation," at least the legal frame for segregation by showing that, well, we were, we were experiencing housing discrimination. We were experiencing limitations in employment. We were experiencing limitations in education. I mean wha, why was it necessary for us to cart out some sort of notion about self-hatred to argue before the Supreme Court that some how it is from that evidence that they should destroy the ed-, edifice of segregation. Well, that will be arguments that we will have for years. The fact is that is, in fact, how, ah, segregation was destroyed. Ah, the evidence of alleged self-hatred in large numbers of Black people was, ah, very touching, very sig-, significant, ah, to the Supreme Court, and in 1954, they certainly placed a great deal of evide-, ah, ah, significance on the fact that there was evidence that, ah, Black people were suffering, ah, self-hatred from the segregationist era. Well, all well and good, so that's something that's argued in the court. Ah, why should that end up distorting our discussions of Black identity from 19, ah, 54 onward. I mean, there shou-, isn't there a distinction between the way we might argue some evidence in the courtroom versus what we might say in the class, in the, ah, in, in the world of academe. That should have been the case, but it was not. Instead, we have a history in which once we won the Supreme Court decision in '54 based on the evidence of self-hatred, that begins to, in some ways, distort the discussion of Black identity in the academic circles, because in a sense, people almost began to say, "If you question the validity of self hatred as the starting point for Black identity, aren't you somehow questioning the validity of the 1954 Supreme Court decision?" That of course, really is an intellectual absurdity, but the fact of the matter is that in part helped to drive this distortion. And so in, in chap-, in the first part of my book, I point out and give evidence of studies that literally were discovering, ah, variability in Black identity, Black strength along with self-hatred, and yet, these studies often found it hard to be published or if they were published, people just simply didn't give recognition to them, so that, it's not that you can't find evidence of diversity in the past. It's not you can't find evidence of strength and variability in the past, but it's often forgotten, ah, washed over, or simply given not very much significance. 

00:23:20
WILLIAM E CROSS, JR.  Well, there's another irony here in which this self-hatred notion has often been extended into the present, and that, that has to do with the evolution of nigrescence models. Nigrescence is a French term that means the process of becoming Black, and in that, that sense, it's a very powerful term. It describes what happens to people of African descent who upon being fo-, fo-, forcibly removed from the continent, in this case through slavery obviously, and dispersed to Brazil, ah, to the West Indies, and of course here in the United States. That, ah, in a sense, they almost lose or in effect they seem to become deculturalized in various ways, and then there's a need, there's a process in which Blacks have to reconnect to their sense of a more authentic self, and we often refer to this discovery of self, discovery of Blackness as nigrescence or literally the process of becoming Black "again," if you will, if, although for some people they, they would perceive it as becoming Black for the first time. In 1971, ah, the psychological literature, within the Black community anyway, explo-, exploded with the number of these becoming Black kinds of models. They were, were a reflection of the Black '60s. Ah, many of us were simply graduate students. Ah, some, of, course, were more advanced. But the totality of our effort was to try to describe people starting out in a stage in which we assume they were operating with more of a self-hatred mode and then they would go through, in effect, uh, identity changes over a series of stages in which they would eventually achieve a new identity that was more self-affirming. In some cases people would say more self-loving. And that from the power of this more positive identity, we would, we would, in a sense, try to build new institutions, try to change political situations, but that one had to go through this conversion. This is not to say that everybody, ah, had to go through it, but we suggest it, it was a dominant dynamic of the '60s and we would even argue that it is a dynamic, easily understood and, and identified in present Black life as shown in the works of Thomas Parham and Janette Helms or Robert Carter, for example, Robert Carter being at Columbia University. 

00:25:35
WILLIAM E CROSS, JR.  We didn't know at the time but that was another form of simplicity. In a sense, we were almost suggesting that we accepted the notion of self-hatred as being true in the past and that this model will help us explain how we escaped self-hatred and achieve a different kind of identity, ah, in the latter stages. You can see now the way I framed this discussion. In some ways, we weren't escaping the self-hated notion. We in some ways were reinforcing it. Well, in the text I try to show that once on understands this distinction between reference group orientation and personal identity, that the self-concept is made up of these two dimensions and they don't always fit the way the simple notion told us in the past. Once you do that and understand you have to re-write the literature on self-hatred, you really have to, at, at least revisit the literature on, on nigrescence or on identity change. So ironically, I started out a book which was meant to be a critique of other people's work, and yet as I got more into it I understood I had to have, in fact, a critique of my own work, or, or if you will, the work of those of us who have been working in the field of identity change. Now, this is a real challenge because in a sense, on the surface it appears that in going through the stages of Black identity change, it does appear at one point as though some aspects of negativity are converted into aspects that are more positive. And that is so powerful that it, it, it requires for us to take our time and explore, ah, how we might rewrite the nigrescence models in such a fashion to accommodate a more diverse notion, of the, of the identities that people bring to that change and also understand that they may end up at the end of this model of, or nigrescence with continued diversity. If you will, that going through nigrescence may not force us, may not cause to achieve consensus in identity. And likewise, we have to understand that in the beginning of the process, we may come to the process with a great deal of variability, diversity in, in the input, diversity in the output. Well, I found again that this distinction between personal identity, and, and group identity again helps us, help me as theorist to better understand the diversity that was probably always there for the first days, and the diversity that seems evident in people with advanced identity. 

00:28:00
WILLIAM E CROSS, JR. This meant, though, I had to find, and we have to find, different words to describe, different ways to describe the behavior of people in what I refer to as the pre-encounter stage, that is to say if we use the word self-hatred to, in a dominant fashion, describe the identity to, to, to be changed, then we're kinda stuck with that frame of reference. How can we reframe that identity that is going to be changed in such a fashion that it allows for a variability and identity functioning that may even include people who are in the early stages and who quite frankly, psychologically speaking, are quite healthy? They're well integrated. They have high self-esteem. Well, how can I do that? Well, in the text, I try to show that we have to get away from the notion of self hatred per se and, and add another phrase, which is people in the first stage, in the pre-encounter stage, often place lo-, low salience, less significance to issues of race and culture in their everyday life. By low salience, I mean to say, that is not that they deny being physically Black. It is not a case of denial. Rather, it a case that they will place more importance on something else to the importance of their identity than their Blackness or Black culture. So it's almost the, the kind of person who in some ways accepts the fact that they are physically Black. They may even accept some aspects that are related to culture. But in the overall scheme of things, when you examine their life, if you can find a way to follow them around, so to speak, or as we do in psychology, we try to present them with a variety of tests, we discover that their priorities in life, their philosophy of life, ah, the way in which they frame their everyday activities, there's something else giving them a sense of importance. There's something else giving them a sense of high self-esteem. It may be again, what, their religion, their occupation, their being a student, ah, ah, their, ah, having certain kinds of interest, their being from one part of the Diaspora versus another. You can find some people placing emphasize on I'm from Haiti, or I'm from the Dominican Republic, or I'm from Manhattan or whatever, there's a variety of ways in which Black people in the pre-encounter stage put together their identity. It's not like they are doing it with blocks, but you know what I'm trying to say, they, they evolve an identity that in a sense allows them to feel a sense of comfort, of integration, of well being, but it may not be primarily anchored in how they interpret being Black or how they interpret, ah, ah, the issues of race. So the low salience does not necessarily mean what, self-hatred. Now, the fact of the matter is we can identify some small percentage of Black people who do appear to suffer from self-hatred. Aha, that means now we can really get into issues of diversity for this first stage. By using the notion of low salience, by using notions of such a miseducation or being socialized in a different way or being taught to have this kind of identity, that helps us to explain diversity and the mental health of Black people. But likewise, we can say that, yes, in some instances there are some Black people in this early, this early stages of which, our model we're talking about where they actually to experience self-hatred. In a, in a kinda twisted way, they have a high salience on race but in a very negative way. They almost view Blackness as an, an antithesis of mental health. And so, we have both. We have the presence of, of a way of explaining those Black people who suffer classic self-hatred, but we also through the notion of low salience, have a way of explaining that, yeah, but the great majority of people in the first stage may not be suffering from self-hatred. They may be suffering from ver, not suffering, but they may be experiencing or constructing their identity in such a fashion that they achieve mental health, but they achieve it in such a fashion that they don't place much salience on their identity. If you will, we're able to see in the pre-encounter stage people who have high and strong levels of personal identity, high personal integration and at the same time show a variability on the RGO frame in which they would probably score low in importance on race. This can be misinterpreted as self-hatred. If you give a measure to a person who actually is, is bubbling with levels of self-esteem and yet you feel as though they must or they should test high on Black consciousness in order for that equate with their self-esteem, you may, therefore, interpret their low scores on a racial test of some sort or racial consciousness test as "self-hatred." Their low score may simply mean to you the following: "Hey folks, on this particular measure that you've given me, I'm trying to tell you not that I'm anti-Black necessarily but I don't place much significance on being Black." And there's a distinction between the two, because someone who would actually have an anti-Black frame of reference, we would expect perhaps that they would test out low on self-esteem or other measures of personal identity. But someone who might be trying to communicate to us, "Hey! That's something I don't place much importance on." They're trying to say the following, "You tested me on your measure by identity and I'm trying to tell you that that's not important to me. You didn't give me a measure of something that is important to me. So therefore, my low score is not an indication that I have no identity. It is an indication instead that I'm low in terms of salience and importance on the measure you gave me and if you could find a way, you would discover I'm high on something else. So, so the reason that I have high self-esteem as a pre-encounter Black is because my self-esteem is anchored in something else that I do." That was a fundamental for me, fundamental rewriting of, of the first stage of nigrescence. It allowed me, and I'd like suggest to you as students of the field, not that you totally accept it, it allows you to explain the fact that you will discover it in any court, so, sort, sort of decent study of Black people, well put together study of Black people. You will discover tremendous variability of people who have pre-encounter identities. And in many instances, they will look just as healthy on their personal identity measures as will people in advance stages of Black identity development. You as a researcher and as a clinician have to explain that. You can't wash it away. I as a theoretician can't wash that away. The evidence that is there. It is, ah, it is evidence that cannot be avoided, and therefore, the issue becomes how can we rewrite theory to match the empirical evidence? How can we rewrite theory to match the, the clinical evidence? How can we account for diversity in Black identity at the pre-encounter level? And I think that the issue of PI and RGO, and this issue of salience of race is how we pull it off.

WILLIAM E. CROSS JR. Now, I think that the stages in between the nigrescence don't need to be rewritten. Ah, if anything we need to know the following. Look. If you develop an identity in which you, ah, don't place much salience on being Black, you're almost a sitting duck for some point in your, your, your experience as a young adolescent or as a, an adult or an older adult that something may come along to cause you to have rethink what it is you, you place importance on, especially you're on the issue of race and culture and that's of course what we mean by the encounter stage. The encounter stage becomes something that causes the person to begin to question what was otherwise, at one time, a very stable identity constellation. It causes the person to be shaken up. Again, this could have been, ah, someone who is self-hating, but in, as I'm trying explain it, it could be someone who, it was anchored in some other aspect of identity. The encounter stage comes along, and they finally say the following thing, "Perhaps, I am mistaken to place so little significance on being Black." That would be in the healthy pre-encounter person. In the case of the self-hating person, "Perhaps there is a way in which I can escape this notion of hating myself." Now, we have an ability to understand both dimensions. So encounter has that effect on the person. The immersion-emersion stage, the middle stage and with the identity is in fact, ah, the two identities are at war, the old identity is at war with the emergence of the new identity, I don't think we have to necessarily re-examine that. I think that over time, that discussion is very stable. It seems to be as appropriate today, ah, as written as it was in 1971. I don't think the issue of diversity, ah, ah, was missed, if you will. Ah, what's more powerful is understanding diversity at the, I always hesitate to say final stages because Black people don't stop growing, but in a sense be it more advance stages, ah, the stages four and five, internalization, internalization commitment. How can we explain diversity there? Isn't it the case that people come into this model with diverse identities, they go through an identity change process, and then in the advance stages don't they come out looking more alike? Again, that's what we try to argue in our early models. Now the evidence suggest that that is simply not true. In a sense, we now know that people in the advanced stages of identity, uhm, do not show the same degree of agreement about how one should interpret being Black. If you will, all the people in the advanced stages for the most part seem to show that they place greater salience, ah, on race, greater salience on culture, greater salience about being Black than do the people in the first stage. And to the extent, there is consensus. Let me repeat that. People in the advanced stages tend to go through a process which results in a fact that they end up placing more significance on race, and really the issue becomes culture, because there's not so much race per se, it is in fact a much deeper issue. They place more emphasize on Blackness as a cultural entity than is typily, typically the case of people of the first stage. So that becomes the consensus. But within this issue of saliency, ah, or greater saliency, there is tremendous variability, tremendous variability. And again, it seems as though we're talking about variability more at the RGO or group identity level than we our personal identity. Let me now try to, ah, discombobulate what I'm trying to say. Number one, the evidence is, ah, for me, if not overwhelming, very, very convincing, that in going through the identity change models, Black people tend not to experience permanent change in their personal identity. In a sense, if you have a pretty good understanding of the personality dynamics of a person, and vis-à-vis such measures of self-esteem, internal, externality, level of happiness, the level ego integration, et cetera. Those things that tend to define the dynamics of personality at least within the context of Western, uhm, ah, psychology. I'm trying to say to you that people will tend to go through the stages, and they will tend to come out with the same personality profile. If you will, ah, sometimes I say with, hopefully, with some degree of, of humor, "neurotic in, neurotic out." (laughs) Ah, in a sense, ah, well-integrated going into the process, well integrated coming out. Let me see if I can give you an example of this. Let's say we have a person who, ah, ah, shows low salience for race and pre-encounter, but this person tends to be someone who's very good with groups. In fact, he or she may even be, ah, ha, have, ah, ah, ah, be a group leader. But what they're, the groups that they're likely to be leading in pre-encounter are likely to be groups that don't place much significance on race. But in a sense, they show a personality tendencies in which they are reasonably well-or, ah, integrated, and in fact, they're not so much followers or not members, members types, they are more pe, more like people who eventually gravitate to roles of leadership. I'm suggesting that when they go through nigrescence, they're likely to exhibit the same kind of behavior in the final stages. Likewise, if a person entered into the model with some degree of shyness that is likely that they'll be just as shy when they leave it. Now, in the middle of the process, keep in mind that the middle of the process is a storm between the old and the new, and the evidence also suggests that the people do tend to experience temporary personality perturbation or change. That is to say they often become more defensive; they often become, uhm, ah, more volatile, ah, so, some degree, somewhat less, somewhat, ah, less predictable, but this perturbation that may occur in various personality dimensions tends to, in fact, fade and the person tends to reintegrate where the, the notion of reintegration is the kind of personality they had at the beginning. So in a sense you can always imagine personality integration at the PI level that is very tight in the, in the pre-encounter stage, there may be some loosening up or reconfiguration as they're trying to go through their changes at the group identity level. And then when that is resolved to some reasonable degree, they tend to reintegrate and the constellation that you see, the profile that you see seems to be very, very similar, if not identical, to the constellation that was there. Shy in, shy out. Neurotic in, neurotic out. Ah, very strong and dynamic in, very strong and dynamic out. That, of course, suggests that nigrescence, for the most part, has it's most profound effect at the RGO level, at the reference group orientation level. And as I'm trying to talk about it to you to, today, it has its most tremendous effect on the issue, how much salience does the person give to their everyday life? Putting it in a, in a more detailed fashion, people in the advanced stages tend to rework their value orientation, their frame of reference about life, their worldview, if you will. And race and culture goes from, maybe, being low in the totem pole, as it was in the first stage, to being very high, and at the core, in some instances, of their, ah, identity frame of reference at the RGO level. Now, having said that, though, I've already told you that we must explain, nonetheless, that these people who end up placing more salience on their everyday life with regard to race and culture nonetheless, don't agree. In some instances, they get into heated debates. How can that be? We have to understand that there are probably at least three categories or three frames of reference that can result in the, ah, uhm, ah, and the final stages. One is a very, very strong nationalistic frame, that is to say, people often find themselves developing a nationalistic frame in the transition stages and they will often carry over that nationalistic frame and they will amplify it in their everyday life as they go into the advanced stages. In a sense, they become African-American nationalist, in the 19, ah, '60s, we referred to it as Black Nationalism. A more sophisticated frame of African-American Nationalism of today, at least in, I'm speaking here of 1993, would be what we refer to as Afrocentricity as, ah, ah, ah, originally, ah, proposed by somebody, ah, ah, by Wade Nobles in the late 70s, and more recently in, and in a very sophisticated fashion by Professor Asante at Temple University. Ah, there are variations on the nationalist theme. In the text, I go into that, in a sense though, ah, the point being that some people end up having a, really, a lifelong nationalistic frame of reference, ah, in their advanced stages of identity. They place, in a sense, almost categoric salience on race in their everyday life. Sometimes they openly deny the, not deny, we'll say that nothing else is as important. They clearly make that the, the primary emphasis in their life and it often dictates a number of aspects of their everyday behavior, especially with regard to cultural, cultural issues, political, political issues. The fact of the matter is, however, there's another cluster of people, who, when they reach the, ah, ah, the final, the more advanced stages, they will tend to integrate not into a nationalistic frame, but into a bicultural frame. They will literally have a repreachment(ph) with their Americanness. In a sense, they almost suggest that, "Yes, I am Black," and they now integrate that into their everyday activities, but they say, "I'm also American," and they go through kind of a psychological filtering, where they pull out and almost publicly display, if you will, make publicly salient the fact that, "I am both an African, a person of African descent and I'm also a person of the American experience." And therefore when they say African-American, they mean that in the most profound bicultural sense. They're not denying the sense of Blackness. They're not denying, they're, they're simply saying that my way of integrating this is to give saliency to both, and this dictates their social network, the things that they give preference for, their lifestyle, ah, their marriage patterns and so on, where they might choose to live. But it doesn't stop there. There are other Black people who develop, not necessarily a better. That not issue here isn't that nationalism is bad and these are the better, that's not the issue here. We're trying to explain the variability that we see in the way people construct their identities in the advanced stages. Ah, I may prefer multicultural. You might prefer multicultural, but someone else will prefer national. That's a value judgment. That's not where I'm coming from. I'm trying to explain the variability in identities in this final stage. Well, we've already said there can be people who are nationalistic. There are people who can be bicultural. Well, there can be people who are multicultural in their frame. Again, they place significance on being Black, but they also share, ah, or they also have a, an identity constellation that places emphasis on something else. So in a sense, with regard to a woman, it might be that their Blackness, their being a woman, it might also be their being gay as we talked about earlier in the example. It might be that their being Hispanic. I, er, met recently a student at Cornell, very comfortable with his, his Blackness, but also keenly interested in Japanese culture. Spent an entire year in Japan, now speaks, ah, Japanese, at least, some variant of it, ah, extremely well, more than likely will experience a lifelong, ah, exploration of what? His Americanness, his African, Africanity, and, in fact, his ability to explore another culture to which he is not normally identified. Now, I don't need to tell you, those of you who are serious students of identity, these kinds of clusterings of people in the advanced stages, from time to time get into very heated debates. That is, if you will, their identities have enough divergency that it can lead to political conflict, to cultural conflict. If you will, Black people in the final stages don't end up thinking alike. There is no one way to be Black. We may wish there were, we may wish, in fact, nigrescence resolves in that fashion, but just as there was diversity in the pra, in, in the beginning, why should we be surprised that there's gonna be diversity at the end of it all? And that leads, of course, to our poli, political struc, ah, debates and so on. As Henry Louis Gates, ah, of Harvard and others would suggest, maybe this is not necessarily health, unhealthy at all. Perhaps, in fact, it is through this vitality, our recognition, our embracement of this diversity that we come closer to understanding the way, at least in this Western context where individualism is stressed and so on, that this, in fact, is more likely to lead us to ah, a, a, a, a, a, a, a discourse in race that is full of vitality, full of, ah, civil conflict and so on, ah, civility in our conflict and debate, and which can lead to better solutions, and solutions probably that don't look alike because in a sense, if we're diverse in our identity that must dictate the fact that there's diversity in the eco, in the various human ecologies in which we are operating in. Perhaps the solutions for, ah, race relations or racial activity or, or cultural activities in this small town in Massachusetts is different than the kinds of solutions that black and white people will, will talk about living in Harlem or in Chicago and so on. In a sense, then, if we look at this kind of frame of reference, we discover that we now can explain diversity in the input of nigrescence and we can explain diversity in the output of nigrescence. In a sense, now we have a notion of nigrescence that does not require us romanticizing Blackness, does not require us denying the existence of self-hating people, but the same time, allows us just to talk about tremendous variability that is likely to occur in our test, in our clinical work, on Black kids, Black adults and so on, who might be described as pre-encounter in their frame of reference. And likewise, we now have a frame of reference which allows us to explain the diverse in identity that exist after nigrescence. I wanna point out, of course, something that should be obvious, but I, I, I think it's important for us to stress. Not all Black people need to go through nigrescence to discover their Blackness. There are a large number, I don't know that we've ever had a, a very good study to explore this, of Black people who are raised and have always been, by, by always, I mean, this has always been the case. There's always a large number of Black people who have been raised in the fashion where they feel very comfortable with their Blackness. In a sense, they feel very integrated around this, ah, ah, this issue in their life, and so they don't necessarily have to go through a nigrescence process per se. Ah, nigrescence helps, helps us to want, better understand those Blacks who might need it. Now, keep in mind, however, that so much of our educational experience, so much of the way the culture, ah, is experienced, by that I mean the American culture, that in some ways we all discovered, ah, experienced some degree of its education, some challenge to, ah, how much salience we're gonna place on race and culture and so it shouldn't surprise you that a large number of Black people, nonetheless, ah, often find themselves, uhm, moving through this kind of experience, ah, because, in fact, there were some things left undone by the way they were socialized at home and in their communities. Now, having said that, Thomas Parham has reminded us, though, of the marvelous, ah, thing about this issue with diversity and Black identity, that even for the Black people, even for Black people who have, ah, reached a point of high levels of Blackness without going through nigrescence, they often experience something called "recycling," and this can also be the case of people who go through an initial stage of nigrescence, but then eventually, ah, later in life go through recycling. By recycling, as I understand it, Thomas reminding us of the fact that we may go through our initial, ah, upbringing with Blackness or initial nigrescence experience, and that may be appropriate for when we are young, ah, to adolescence or young adults. But as we go through the life span, we may encounter new questions in life, new challenges in life, getting married, getting divorced, having a loved one to die, ah, having one's children to grow up. Both positive and negative instances can impinge upon us. Losing our jobs, ah, being fired or whatever can cause us to, in a sense, have to, ah, encounter new questions, which we, for whatever reason, did not really, ah, understand when we were going through our first episode of Blackness, and these new questions, in a sense, uhm, are almost representing new encounters, and these new encounters cause us to rethink some aspects of our Blackness that we really could not think about earlier on, and these new questions may stimulate a full-blown, ah, experience in which, ah, we don't go back to pre-encounter, but the new encounter causes us to go through, ah, tumultuous middle stage again or, as is probably likely the case, it may cause us to have to rethink some small but important aspect of our Blackness, and so, therefore, the recycling is not so volatile. It is not so emotional, although it is very important. Well, there's, of course, much more to be said and I hope that this, this chat that we are having is a stimulation for you to read what I've written. Uhm, uhm, I'd like to think that I've made a real earnest attempt to engage you both in the film, but even more so on the text, ah, in a fashion that does what? That shows you that this is a marvelous period in the study of Black identity. We have broken away from the simplistic models, the self-hatred model in the past even the is, the simple models in nigrescence which I and others have written in the past. We have broken away from both frames of reference and we are pushing forward to better understanding in the present, ah, ah, tense, uhm, instances the di, the, the tremendous vitality and diversity that one has to, to discover both in Black people who are really troubled about themselves as well as Black people who are experiencing various degrees of high levels of middle health, that this diversity was probably always present in our experience. In some ways, it's a diversity and, and, ah, that we can discover in history text and in, in, in literature text and in text on plays and poetry more readily than we can find the psychology. I think, though, today, with people like Tom Parham, Janet Helms, Robert Carter, ah, Gerald Jackson, who were experimental in industry, ah, ah, ah, Wade Boykin at Howard, we are now moving away from these issues of simple-minded self-hatred or simple-minded self-love. We're discovering literally a sea of mystery of Black people, ah, that is absolutely fascinating, and yet has always been there. And so therefore, the, the, ah, time to explore this is gonna be more difficult because the questions being asked are more difficult and more unpredictable, but I would argue with you and for those of you who are students of this field, it is a wonderful time because, in a sense, we are really discovering the true depth of our humanity. Any model, be it a nigrescence model or a self-hatred model, which oversimplifies the psychology of Black people, is inherently inhuman because, in a sense, it is making us less human than other people who we would never think of describing in some simplistic terms. So while diversity is a challenge for you and I, it is another expression of, of our truer discovery of the real essence of who we are, and that is fundamentally human beings as complex as everyone else, and therefore, our psychology is likely to be as complex. Thank you.
