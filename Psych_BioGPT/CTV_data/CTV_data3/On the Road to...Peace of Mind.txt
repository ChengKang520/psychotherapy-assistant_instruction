00:00:00
A MOLENWIEK FILM IN ASSOCIATION WITH HEALTHNET-TPO UGANDA, EAST AFRICA 

00:00:00
NANCY BARON  Relief workers gather in Uganda from around the globe. Most are survivors of war. They're counselors, teachers, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, and community leaders. They work with HealthNet-TPO, a Dutch organization with projects dedicated to helping people to manage the psychosocial and mental health consequences of war and violence. They are here for a TOT, a Training of Trainers course. 

00:00:55
[sil.] 

00:00:55
NANCY BARON  At the end of three weeks, they're expected to return home with new knowledge and skills so that they can train others about the consequences of war and how to do practical, community-based, helping interventions. 

00:01:10
on the road to... PEACE OF MIND A FILM BY HENS VAN ROOIJ & JOOP VAN WIJK HEALTHNET/TPO OFFICE, KAMPALA 

00:01:10
FETSUM  The world has never wanted to recognize us, so we still don't exist on this map, but I think, ah, Eritrea is, ah, located in, ah, East Africa. It still doesn't show on the map, but it is the north part. I think I should put it on the map. 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN I have here (inaudible ). 

00:02:21
NANCY BARON Most importantly, this experienced, multicultural group will learn from each other through sharing their experiences and expertise about war-affected people and by offering each other support and feedback as they practice the skills necessary to become trainers. 

00:02:35
NANCY BARON  I wonder what word you use in your own local dialect for "psychosocial," yeah? Stephen, maybe you can start by giving us an example? 

00:02:45
STEPHEN  [non-English narration] it means you have a problem. 

00:02:50
NANCY BARON  Okay. 

00:02:55
STEPHEN And this problem makes you not sleep. Uhm, you're not at ease. Ah, it makes you worried. Now, it, it describes something like stress, actually. 

00:03:10
UNKNOWN [non-English narration] and [non-English narration], [non-English narration] means, explaining the mental status and [non-English narration] explains the social. 

00:03:20
UNKNOWN Ah, psychosocial problem, [non-English narration]. 

00:03:25
NANCY BARON Okay. 

00:03:25
UNKNOWN It means any psychological problem, feeling, thinking related to our experience in, ah, society. Any problem differs, any psychological problem related to any, ah, problem in a society because. (crosstalk) 

00:03:40
NANCY BARON Okay. So there are words right within your own language that allow for psychosocial. Again, within your own countries, there are similarities and differences between different groups and different people, let alone country to country, so we're gonna look at the differences in problems, in needs. 

00:04:00
CONSEQUENCES OF WAR 

00:04:00
UNKNOWN  Food supply is not enough for them. 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Agressivity(ph). [non-English narration]. (crosstalk) 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Which would then become a big problem. (crosstalk) 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN  And the food given is very little. 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN As (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:04:18
FETSUM ERITREA/PSYCHIATRIST 

00:04:18
FETSUM They had, ah, a conflict within, ah, which was an independence struggle between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and the Eritreans have struggled for about 30 years, which started in 1961, and the war was finished by freeing the whole of Eritrea after 30 years of struggle in 1991. 

00:04:35
STEPHEN SUDAN/CO-TRAINER 

00:04:35
STEPHEN There has been war already twice in our country. The first one was in, ah, I think, '55 up to '72. That was between, ah, Southern Sudan and the, the Northern Sudan, which is Arab, of course, against, ah, Black Africans. Then this. (crosstalk) 

00:04:55
FETSUM And rebuilding of the country was going on very well until 1998. In 1998, the situation has changed. Over the previous years of independence, the relationship with Ethiopians was very good. Everything was going smooth, ah, but for a reason of the border conflict, ah, in 1998, another, ah, war was started, and this war was. (crosstalk) 

00:05:15
STEPHEN Like I said one time, ah, the war is, you know, it's religious. it's racial, and, and both sides, you know, are not easy to compromise with the, with one another. Ah, many people have tried to mediate. It hasn't worked. So, personally, I believe there may be no peace soon. 

00:05:45
UNKNOWN And after you're finished. 

00:05:45
UNKNOWN Prioritize. 

00:05:45
UNKNOWN  Okay? 

00:05:50
UNKNOWN And there was (inaudible ). 

00:05:55
[sil.] 

00:05:55
UNKNOWN  So, being a Tibetan, the first one is we didn't have a country, and second one is economic problem. Third one is unemployment. 

00:06:05
FETSUM In the last 30 years of war, Eritrea has been totally destroyed. No infrastructure. No services. A lot of, ah, human resource has not been there. 

00:06:15
UNKNOWN We have family neglect, human rights violation, community conflict. 

00:06:20
UNKNOWN Influx of new refugees, adaptation problem. 

00:06:25
FETSUM Sometimes a whole village of women had been raped. 

00:06:25
UNKNOWN  Then HIV and AIDS. Deep in the rural areas is a very big problem. 

00:06:30
NANCY USA/MASTER-TRAINER 

00:06:30
NANCY BARON  Uhm, right, yeah, when we look at our own programs and we look at the reasons that we've started our programs, oftentimes what we've said is we're starting our programs because of war, either conflict/post-conflict, but we also say we're starting our programs because of the problem of trauma. What's a trauma? Yes? 

00:06:55
UNKNOWN It's a terrifying event, factor(ph) in life. 

00:06:55
NANCY BARON Okay, so trauma's a terrifying event, an unusually terrifying, big event, yeah? 

00:07:00
STEPHEN  Uhm, well, of course, as a person who comes from a, you know, a country ravaged by war, definitely, I have faced a lot of difficulties. 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:15
STEPHEN  We had faced a lot of difficulties. When I, you know, when the rebels came to the, the town in which I was living, you know, they came just suddenly and made everybody just go where, where they wanted, and you had to go without anything. So I left. I left everything. 

00:07:40
NANCY BARON What else? 

00:07:40
UNKNOWN  Earthquake. (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
UNKNOWN Earthquake. 

00:07:45
NANCY BARON An earthquake, could be. 

00:07:45
UNKNOWN Flood. 

00:07:45
NANCY BARON Flood. 

00:07:45
UNKNOWN Volcanoes and. (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
NANCY BARON  Volcanoes, a disaster, a national disas, natural disaster. A war. What else? What else is a trauma? So what's a trauma and what isn't a trauma? 

00:07:55
UNKNOWN  In the way you react to it. 

00:08:00
NANCY BARON Ah, so the, the way you react. (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
UNKNOWN The reaction. 

00:08:05
NANCY BARON All right. So an event takes place and the way in which I respond is whether or not I end up traumatized or not. It's the meaning of the trauma to the person, their own reaction and the way that they can take care of themselves in it, correct? 

00:08:20
STEPHEN I left by foot, went to some village, stayed there for about six months. And later on, uhm, I came to my original village, and then after about another six months, I, I came to Uganda as a refugee. 

00:08:45
SIVA, SRI LANKA/PSYCHIATRIST 

00:08:45
SIVA Their repeated displacement is a kind of "plucking you from your root parts." So after that, you see, ah, the people don't have good faith in long-term plans. They all have some very short-term plans. I mean, it's a kind of day-to-day plan. Ah, I could remember in my child years, I was thinking of, "Okay, after 20 years, I, I'm going to become a doctor," or something like that. But nowadays, nobody is sure about that. There's uncertainty about the future. Ah, people think that they can't do anything because the, the power is not in their hand. They can't do any change in the system. So, ah, if you ask me what's the main problem in our part, I would say repeated displacement. 

00:09:30
LOUISE BURUNDI/COUNSELOR 

00:09:30
LOUISE  Now, ah, maybe I have moved from my place where you, and you have left everything there, have been thrown in a camp, hmm, just on, ordinary(ph) day room. You don't have, ah, maybe, ah, (inaudible ) anywhere. You can now go in front. We are waiting for NGOs to come to, or can now, even in, ah, that some place, we had NGOs, I don't think, (inaudible ) there are nobody to say, now, we have end our work. We have to go back and people has still have that fear of going back to their villages. Life is terribly hard because, like now, where I'm working, I know all, all the people, they come and just, we say socioeconomic problems only. They wouldn't mind their own food they want. So I'm saying, there's our problem. It is a hard, hard life, you know? 

00:10:15
NANCY BARON Protective factor usually would be, and maybe sometimes it is, all right, but it, is it, a, a protective factor would protect us and help us to overcome or cope with our problems. So protective factor could be what? Family? (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN Family. 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN Family. 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:10:33
NANCY BARON Hmm? 

00:10:33
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) systems. 

00:10:35
NANCY BARON Ah, ah, your family system? 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN Social System. 

00:10:35
NANCY BARON Social systems. 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN Experience, can it be if, can, can experience be a protective factor? (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
NANCY BARON Sure. Experience, past experience. Yeah, absolutely. 

00:10:45
FETSUM Like when the war really got severe, people have gone to church and prayed for hours and hours. So that gives them a sense of, ah, having some, you know, believing in God that God is in control and that gives a sense of security. So that helps in coping with trauma, and, ah, ah, people would be able to cope and fight whatever is around to, to overcome the problems they have. 

00:11:10
NANCY BARON I was tortured. I can't get it out of my mind. It's two years later. I'm depressed and I've become an alcoholic. Yeah? So we have primary symptoms, the beginning symptoms, but we also have what we would call secondary consequences. So we're not necessarily saying, because they have a next to next event, it's because they have so many events, that they have a problem. It's this cumulation. 

00:11:40
[sil.] 

00:11:40
NANCY BARON  Individuals, families and communities- 

00:11:45
MAAJI REFUGEE CAMP 

00:11:45
NANCY BARON - have coped with problems, culture by culture, throughout eternity. Survivors of war have amazing resilience. Most manage to adjust to their changing worlds. However, natural support structures often become damaged or overwhelmed. In addition to assisting people with problems directly related to war, those with physical or mental difficulties can become particularly vulnerable. 

00:12:10
UNKNOWN  Brum, brum, brum, brum, brum, brum. 

00:12:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:12:16
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:12:16
ROSE REFUGEE/COUNSELOR 

00:12:16
ROSE  Ah, people here, they have a lot of belief in spirits. At times, ah, they think that people, ah, ah, inherit, ah, the, the, the spirits of the grand-grandfathers. They have that belief that spirit is just, uhm, is, for them, they think they can live with the spirits, and then at times they may, they say that, ah, it could be bad luck, could also be bad luck that maybe he, he crossed the river or he crossed the mountain and these bad spirits landed on, on him, so that is their belief.

00:14:40

00:14:40
MICHAEL But now, when they came here, all their brothers died now, they are left to just, alone and life has, has become difficult in terms of food and support. 

00:14:50
UNKNOWN [non-English narration]. 

00:14:50
MICHAEL  They first began by going to traditional healer, they, because they didn't know, ah, that, ah, ah, TPO would help. They wasted a lot of, ah, goats(ph) and then money, ah, giving to the traditional healers trying to, to, to, to, to get for families and for all the sickness.

00:15:35
[sil.] 

00:15:35
NANCY BARON  I, I know that in our experience is that there are very few people with epilepsy who don't have psychosocial problems, is that they have psychosocial problems because of the stigma in the community. Then what do you do? 

00:16:05
FETSUM Okay, but I mean, that's why you need the counselors. 

00:16:05
NANCY BARON Yeah? And the psychosocial, ah, distress that's caused by having that problem is, is horrific. 

00:16:15
FETSUM Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
NANCY BARON I mean, it's horrible, and they're stigmatized. They're beaten. They're, they're, they're, they're... (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
FETSUM Many of them having seizures? (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
NANCY BARON ...believed to be, yeah. well, and that people don't help them. 

00:16:20
FETSUM Hmm. 

00:16:20
NANCY BARON  People let them die. 

00:16:25
FETSUM Yes. 

00:16:25
NANCY BARON Ah, people encourage them to die. 

00:16:25
FETSUM Yeah. Hmm. 

00:16:25
NANCY BARON Did you, did you wanna make a phone call home? 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:16:30
NANCY BARON Herman told me that you wanted to make a phone call, so I, ah, just, whenever you want or, uhm, maybe after class, just take my telephone and call? (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:16:35
NANCY BARON Yeah? Okay? (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:16:40
NANCY BARON Okay. Talk to baby. 

00:16:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:16:40
INTERVENTIONS 

00:16:40
NANCY BARON  We can train a counselor in a few months, but we can't train a psychotherapist nor in many of the context we work do we feel that psychotherapy would be the best choice of treatment. It's a Westernized model or a Western model that we feel is not the most appropriate to the people we're servicing. So what we feel is most necessary, though, are the psychosocial interventions that have to do with survival, that have to do with politics and human rights and policy making, all right? We feel that those are the most important, and oftentimes, those are the places that psychosocial work has not been very actively involved. It's not just one thing, is that there is interaction between a lot of these levels, yeah? It's that, if you give psychiatric medication, all right, you also oftentimes are providing self-help groups for those people so that the people are also meeting together with others with similar problems. You're providing support for their families so their families are able to also help them. You're providing community empowerment so the community knows how to help the mentally ill. So a lot of them interrelate, yeah, so thereby, are fluid lines. 

00:17:55
SIVA Our families were more, kind of, extended family system earlier, and it, not only that, it's more than that. So, families tend to live together. We used to call it as a "village," in Tamil, "ur". So the village system is a very powerful system. If something happened to one family, all the village people will come and gather to that family. We are, we were not alone. 

00:18:15
UNKNOWN We didn't know what to do, was running about. We felt as if everybody was the enemy. So in that process, ah, the, the, the families come together. 

00:18:25
NANCY BARON But what was wrong with him? He was paranoid? He, he, (crosstalk) 

00:18:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:18:30
NANCY BARON people were out to get him and the traditional healing, up to this day has helped him? 

00:18:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:18:35
FETSUM Traditional issues and cultural issues is usually a taboo of the intellectual people. We don't want to, to really talk about it, but we also don't want to, ah, deny it exists. 

00:18:45
NANCY BARON The question, I think, that we're trying to talk about is how to take that concept, the concept that says, "Yes, we all agree that culture is important and what people believe is important," or do we integrate, which is, we actually, you know, share cases. We work together. 

00:19:00
UNKNOWN We all recognize that they, they also can help people, so why we don't integrate them, why you don't encourage people to go to them because the traditional healer is at the same village, ah, nearby them, they can, ah, not spend a lot of money and then they can get help. 

00:19:20
SIVA So, I think, in future we can, step by step, we can, ah, gradually incorporate the traditional system into the psychosocial working group, and to, if possible, to teach them what is their limits, I mean to how extent they can go, what kind of problems need traditional sector, what kind of problems needs "Western" medications and other kinds of therapies. I think it will take some time, but, ah. 

00:19:45
PETER / THE NETHERLANDS PSYCHIATRIST 

00:19:45
PETER  I see a lot of problems in that. If I imagine, uhm, I, as a Western-trained psychiatrist with a lot of knowledge behind me, a library full of books, uhm, hundreds of thousand of double-blind studies and, and evidence-based psychiatry and then those healers, uhm, without much formal education, without, ah, a, a well organized system, there is a huge power difference. There is a huge difference in knowledge. I, I don't see how, but I think we have to find ways to cooperate but don't ask me how. 

00:20:35
NANCY BARON  Actually the problem is much greater than that. Vengeance, yeah? Revenge? 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN  Revenge is something which actually we have inherited from traditions, cause the, ah, this is what have been happening. One clan will go and attack the other. When one person, one person of that clan is killed, the rest also organize a revenge. 

00:21:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:21:00
UNKNOWN So this is an issue in which a way continue to expand and, ah, go endlessly. 

00:21:10
UNKNOWN If somebody kills one person, he has to be killed. Otherwise you cannot live, ah, on that area and the family who's, who lost the family member has to revenge. For example, if my father is killed by another man, and if I am a boy, if I don't kill the killer of my father, I will not be accepted in the society. 

00:21:30
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:21:30
UNKNOWN So I have to revenge. 

00:21:30
UNKNOWN If you are not revenging, then you are not considered as the, the strongest, uhm, tribe or, uhm, clan of course in that community. 

00:21:40
FETSUM But when there is a severe life-threatening situation coming towards you, then there is a natural feeling that you have, you need to do the same thing. I mean, everybody is saying that we have the feelings. (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
NANCY BARON Is that what you're saying? Is everybody saying there's the need to do the same thing? I don't think so. (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
FETSUM No, no. 

00:21:55
UNKNOWN I think it's better not to take revenge. 

00:22:00
UNKNOWN Uh hmm, Uh hmm. 

00:22:00
UNKNOWN It will never end the war. (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:22:05
UNKNOWN And we, we never, ah, take revenge the same. It all went over that what they did it. 

00:22:10
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:22:10
UNKNOWN Like, ah, a lot of, have mentioned, usually it never comes through to the one who do it. 

00:22:15
NANCY BARON Hmm, okay? Forgiveness. Do we forgive? Can we live next door to our enemy? In Rwanda, they're not with us. They're in Rwanda, yeah, how many, 800,000 people were massacred, yeah. And now people are living next door to each other. 

00:22:35
LOUISE For us who are now civilians we are, we know what we are and, ah, and that we are suffering. We know we are losing too much. I live in the capital city now. I'm not allowed to go to my village. Why? Because I know, I don't know the person who would take me, would, would he take me as a, a Hutu. So, I don't know. So, there is a problem, but you can see, ah, for people they are tired, really tired, even I who had to see would finally to say, "No, we are tired. It is enough. We have lost enough." 

00:23:00
STEPHEN Forgiving and forgetting will never be very easy, I think. Well, if both parties realize, if they think that the war is doing more harm than, ah, having peace, then probably they can say, "Let's forget this and begin life anew so that we can have peace. We can live in peace and just have a good life." That's if both of them come to that level(ph) but I, I don't think how either party can come to, to realize that. Yeah, it, it's not very easy, yeah. It's not. 

00:23:45
LOUISE It will take long because now we are going this, ah, a peace process (inaudible ) have been involved there, but we are still having a, a rebel, a rebel group that, who hasn't, shoots(ph) everything, even today. 

00:24:00
SHERIN NAMIBIA / OFFICE MANAGER 

00:24:00
SHERIN We have a national policy of reconciliation, but, ah, right now it is more on paper than on anything else, but the, the majority of the population at least tries to work together for the sake of, ah, the economy, for the sake of development. 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN  It, it could be a culture change. 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN Could be, ah, the culture of hate could be changed into something more acceptable or more or less violent or, or something, but it, it, it, if, if these things don't happen overnight, there, mi, might just so be that the next generation would be so militant that they would even be, things would be worse than they, they were before. I don't know. But, ah, the element of forgiveness, it, it's there to, to a certain extent, especially if you want a better future, if there is a better future, if we can. 

00:25:00
NANCY BARON  It's, ah, well said as to what reconciliation is, what it's about. How does that enter our work though? How does that enter our psychosocial work? Where does that go next to and work inside and integrate with psychosocial work? How do we use that?

00:25:35
TRAINING METHODS 

00:25:35
PETER  What I learned in this course is how important it is to, uhm, to change your message in a way that the people are able to receive it, so that you, ah, use the right teaching methods, that you use ways to make your message as simple as possible, and, uhm, adapt it to the way they think and feel. And this seems an open door, but, uhm, it proved sometimes difficult in all the role plays and things we did, ah, that we often had, uhm, cultural clashes, like the people from Asia and the people from Europe and the people from Africa, they didn't immediately understood what the other meant. 

00:27:35
STEPHEN  Madang ta. 

00:27:40
UNKNOWN Madang ta. 

00:27:40
UNKNOWN Madang ta. 

00:27:40
STEPHEN And when you are saying that, your hands should be up. Everybody put it just like that. "Madang ta." 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN Madang ta. 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN Madang ta. 

00:27:45
STEPHEN Madang ta. 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN  Madang ta. 

00:27:50
UNKNOWN Madang ta. 

00:27:50
STEPHEN Okay. That's how you greet a crowd. 

00:27:50
NANCY BARON How come we all know how? 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN Because we practice. (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN We did it just today. 

00:27:55
NANCY BARON Hmm? Because we practiced, all right? So when you're learning how to do something, you're teaching someone how to do something if you practice and he can see you're doing it, he knows for sure that you learned, and the only way you'll know what people understand is either by questions or asking them to tell you what they learned. Very often, what's essential to know can get lost in all this other stuff, and people have listened to "nice to know" and "useful to know," all right? They've listened to it, maybe even they'll remember it, but they haven't gotten the point, yeah. So they have to know what's essential to know and that's where we stay. 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN  I'm looking at the poster and I'm a community member. 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN What am I learning? 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN This man is very rich. You can see how he's dressing. He's very smart. He has a lot of money and he's trying to get hold of this girl. This is a school box, he's from the school. Then the end result of that would be pregnancy, teenage pregnancy. 

00:29:00
NANCY BARON I see this picture. 

00:29:00
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:29:00
NANCY BARON  I see this picture and I see this picture. What have I learned? 

00:29:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:29:09
UNKNOWN  Hmm. 

00:29:10
UNKNOWN How to rape a teenager. 

00:29:10
NANCY BARON Hmm? 

00:29:10
NANCY BARON How to rape a teen, what di, what did you heard she said? Say it again. 

00:29:15
UNKNOWN (laughing) Yeah, how to rape a teenager. 

00:29:15
UNKNOWN  (laughing) That's too harsh. 

00:29:20
NANCY BARON Uh-oh. (laughs) 

00:29:20
FETSUM Being the only psychiatrist in the country, I should be able to train other to do things very effectively. So what I've learned from this course is to pick specific teaching skills that would make other people effective in doing, ah, mental health work, in doing counseling, in helping people, in doing community type of work et cetera. So, ah, I have learned some new skills that I can incorporate with what I have been doing in the past. 

00:29:50
UNKNOWN 'Coz I have a wife who drinks and it causes problems to my neighbors. 

00:29:55
NANCY BARON  Uh hmm. 

00:30:00
UNKNOWN She's, quarrels. She beats the children. Ah, she doesn't even cook. She's troublesome to them also. 

00:30:05
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:30:05
UNKNOWN  Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:30:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:30:10
NANCY BARON So she's troublesome to you and she's troublesome to your neighbors... (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:30:10
NANCY BARON ...and to your family... (crosstalk) 

00:30:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:30:15
NANCY BARON ...as well of course to your children? 

00:30:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:30:15
NANCY BARON Yeah. 

00:30:15
NANCY BARON He needs to feel as if, all right, I, I'm understanding him, or doing my best, but I'm trying to stand in his shoes. What do I need to be sure to do right now so that I'm doing that first step of beginning to build a relationship? What do I need to do? (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
UNKNOWN Postu, body posture, eye contact, so you were saying, "Uh hmm, uh hmm." 

00:30:35
NANCY BARON So my first steps were that I was encouraging him to speak. 

00:30:40
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. Okay. 

00:30:40
NANCY BARON So role-play, I think, has to be used clear purpose in mind. Earlier, I said I was gonna use it for this and this skills. As long as I know exactly what I'm gonna teach by it, the role-play is very, very useful. 

00:30:55
UNKNOWN I can do it. You can do it. We can do it. Epilepsy can be managed. Go to the clinic. I can do it. You can do it. We can do it. Epilepsy can be managed. Take your pills daily. I can do it. You can do it. (laughter) We can do it. (laughter) 

00:31:20
NANCY BARON  We walk away singing about epilepsy in a positive way, particularly again in rural communities, where people can't read; they can't write. It's very hard to get the points across. 

00:31:35
SHERIN  It is useful in the sense that we can learn a lot from her way of doing things. It could be more optimistic, you know, in, in the sense that, ah, it does not have all these other connotations of war and conflict and there's a moment of motivation and, ah, all this, all the other reasons that could make it not work. So, it is kind of something positive that we can look up to and that we can use as motivation. 

00:32:15
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:32:15
UNKNOWN They can even take the, the message to their homes. (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible) to their homes. 

00:32:20
UNKNOWN Okay? Where they just move, (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
UNKNOWN Not. 

00:32:20
UNKNOWN they can begin singing. 

00:32:20
UNKNOWN Singing and then. (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
UNKNOWN They can begin singing for, for later, but the, is it written. (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN Is (inaudible ) 

00:32:26
UNKNOWN And these (inaudible ) 

00:32:27
UNKNOWN They can do it. Everyone can do it. Parents can do it. Every person does it. (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
UNKNOWN (laughing) Yes. 

00:32:30
UNKNOWN  You can do it. (laughing) 

00:32:35
FIELD BASED LEARNING 

00:32:35
NANCY BARON  During field visits, the TOT group sees how psychosocial interventions, like community education, support groups and individual and family counseling strengthen the capacities of war-affected people, so that they can help themselves. They also witnessed the workings of the community-based mental health clinic.

00:33:50
MAAJI REFUGEE CAMP COMMUNITY CENTER 

00:33:50
NANCY BARON  -by preparing a training workshop that they teach to leaders in a community site. This gives them the opportunity to try out their skills and receive feedback to further their learning. 

00:34:00
PETER  'Coz I know, I, I feel ashamed about my problem. 

00:34:05
UNKNOWN  You have big problem I think. 

00:34:10
PETER Yes. 

00:34:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:34:10
PETER My wife, she left me. 

00:34:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:34:10
PETER  And the, the children are also here. She took one but she left the two with me. I came to ask you for advice so maybe you can help me. 

00:34:20
UNKNOWN No other assistant for the children? No? 

00:34:25
PETER No, no, maybe some neighbors can help but it's, I find it difficult to ask. 

00:34:35
UNKNOWN That's very good. Listening. What do we mean by listening? Is it very important, eh, Mr. (inaudible ), is it important in our life? 

00:34:46
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:34:46
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:34:46
UNKNOWN Eh, ah? I want an answer. Not the same, ah, the people also, you will also say, "ah, the people," eh? [non-English narration]... (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:34:57
UNKNOWN "Why, why have you come here?" 

00:34:57
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:34:57
UNKNOWN  "Why are you not talking?" (crosstalk) 

00:35:00
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:35:00
UNKNOWN Eh? [non-English narration] 

00:35:00
UNKNOWN Oh. 

00:35:00
UNKNOWN Yes, you must talk gently to the person, so that the person also feels he is respected or she's respected, is that not so? 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN So. 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:35:10
NANCY BARON It's very nice when you're doing your conclusion at the end to repeat yourself so they know what you're concluding. (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:35:15
NANCY BARON They just need a simple, basic understanding that's useful for their community. 

00:35:20
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:35:20
PETER Does not want to eat, (crosstalk) 

00:35:20
UNKNOWN [non-English narration] 

00:35:20
PETER  does not to have sex with the husband anymore. Doesn't want. (crosstalk) 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN [non-English narration] 

00:35:30
PETER But when the person has mental illness it gives problems in the family also. Their husband wants to divorce or the children are not taken proper care of. So mental illness gives problems in the family life. A person with mental illness is a human being. He needs our respect and our, ah, attention. 

00:35:50
LESSONS LEARNED 

00:35:50
PETER  I worked in, uhm, in the Netherlands with traumatized people, uhm, for example traumatized police officers, ah, in Amsterdam, and, uhm, well I don't want to make their problems smaller than they are because they are suffering, really suffering from psychiatric, ah, ah, problems. But then if I see here the, the huge amount of trauma that, that, that came off the people on a collective level, then you would expect that people would sit quietly in, in their house, ah, with a full blown post-traumatic stress disorder just waiting for a doctor to come to help, them. Ah, this is not what I see here. There is ah, uhm, an enormous resilience here and people, I don't know how, but in a way people find ways together to overcome a lot of the problems. 

00:37:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:37:00
PETER Yeah. 

00:37:00
LOUISE Now having these people from different, ah, country, ah, I was somehow, I get also some kind of comfort 'coz, I find that, we are not only the Burundi's(ph) who are suffering. There are other people even, who are suffering more and was(ph) especially touched with the, the people from Tibet, who, and they say, "We don't have a country." I, it was too much for me, because I remember the day as I've spent in Kenya, ah, I just could feel that I am not in my country. It was something I had to bear, but, but for somebody who said, "I don't have a country," and there's no hope of you getting that country is something touching. 

00:37:45
