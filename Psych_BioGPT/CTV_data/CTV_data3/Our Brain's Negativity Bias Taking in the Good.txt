RICH Welcome, everyone. Rich Simon, Editor of Psychotherapy Networker, I'm your host today and for this series. And in this series we've been looking at the issue of working with emotion in the consulting room. Therapist are-- must be experts in human emotion. People come to us typically in states of emotional distress and they're recently in our field. I think there've been a number of retrospectives and scientific input, technical breakthroughs that have really uh, given us the opportunity to look at this issue of working with emotional consulting groups in different ways. Today, we're fortunate to have with us Rick Hansen the author of Buddha's Brain, someone's who's really been a student of both spiritual practice and of these recent developments in brain science to bring those to bear on our understanding of emotion and how therapists work with emotion in their practices. Rick, good afternoon, how are you? 

00:01:15
RICK Hi, Rich. Great! Happy to be here. 

00:01:20
RICH So, let's just get into it um, in the last 10 or 15 years following the decade of the brain and all that we've learned about how the nervous system works and finally gotten inside the black box, what is it that--? How is our basic understanding of human emotion? How's that been affected by what we've discovered about how the brain actually works? 

00:01:50
RICK Well, it's context uh, it's been realized how enormously influential is and how much it organizes the brain as a whole. And continually uh, in effect confers what's called balance; pleasant-unpleasant, approach-avoid, or if it's neutral kinda brush it aside and move on. Uh, it continually confers balance to things or it establishes the values of things and it helps us as very, very mature primates uh, very developed primates, as well as other animals uh, with a limbic system which is to say certainly, the mammals, uh to-- or really organize and direct themselves towards the goals that promote their survival as well as, you know, have fun along the way. Uh, you know, emotions have been a huge area of research. And one of the things to say about it actually is to point out our kinship with other animals of fundamentally the emotional and motivational structures and processes in the brain are what's called homologous or equivalent or consistent among all mammals. Uh, ranging from humans, you know, to mice and squirrels. Uh, when I see a little rat scuttling around I feel like kinship I go: "Cous' how are you?" It never answers but I'll ask it. 

00:03:10
RICH Well, that's-- that you know, I-- and I am sure there's many pet lovers in this audience and that certainly seems like that's the-- the fundamental connection. That human beings really uh, particularly with cats and dogs, but with other mammals too, feel like kinship . So, what are the things that you've addressed uh, and really zeroed in on as what you've spoken of as the negativity bias uh, in our human emotional experience? And how that is related to the way we're-- our brains are wired? Talk to us a bit about that. 

00:03:45
RICK Yeah, well, to create a little bit of context uh, in any moment in time uh, we're having states of mind and presumably our cousins, if you will, the monkeys, and the rabbits, and the mice are also having uh, mental states. Or more fundamentally even uh, if you think about unconscious processing, which is the great bulk of the information processing in the brain, these various states of information are continually flowing through the nervous system headquartered in the brain. We're aware of the tip of the iceberg, of course. Now, these mental states create neural traits. In other words, what people experience moment to moment builds lasting structure in the brain. The brain is a learning organ. It's continually trying to learn from its experiences, most fundamentally to pass on its genes. So, the negativity bias comes in, in this way. Our ancestors had to both approach carrots and avoid sticks, all right? But here's the difference between a carrot and a stick in the wild, if you fail to get a carrot today eh, you probably have a chance at a carrot tomorrow, but if you fail to avoid that stick today, no more carrots forever. Sticks are different from carrots typically in the urgency and impact. So, the brain has evolved what scientist call a negativity bias that is very organized around rule one in the wild, which is, eat lunch today, don't be lunch today. So, there are many examples of that I'll give you a few. One is the familiar finding from John Gottman who finds that strong lasting couples need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions. That means that, in effect, you know, one negative interaction is as powerful as five positive ones. Might think about the research on learned helplessness in which it's very easy to train mammals, whether they're dogs or humans, in experiences of entrapment, futility and defeat, which as we know is the fast track to depression . On the other hand, it takes many, many, many more times-- many times as many, five, ten times as many, alternate experiences of being able to be successful, to have some efficacy with your hammer instead of a nail to unlearn that helplessness; another example of the negative bias. And the last one I'll mention here which is really relevant to the impact of positive and negative emotions is that negative experiences, unpleasant experiences, including unpleasant emotional experiences , particularly everyday ones, such as irritability, or anxiety, or sadness, or a sense of inadequacy, those negative experiences are fast tracked right into implicit memory storage. Implicit memory being the great bulk of the learning of the structure building of the brain that has to do with how to do things as well as the emotional residues of lived experience. So, we have the fast track system that takes those negative experiences right into storage because once burned, twice shy. If you in the wild ever have a-- ever escaped from a predator or a natural hazard or aggression, inside or between primate BAMS including human BAMS, well you better remember how to do that because you may not get a second chance. But unless they're very intense novel million dollar moments, positive experiences, ordinary pleasant experiences of daily life have plain vanilla memory systems. And, as we know, from lots and lots of research on cognitive psychology, plain vanilla memory systems uh, information needs to be held in short term buffers for fairly long periods of time, 10 or 20 seconds in a row, often with a fair amount of intensity and repetition, to transfer to long term storage. But how often do we actually do that with pleasant experiences, even if we're having them a few-- for a few seconds at a time? And even if new pleasant experiences come in, will they dislodge the current ones before they have a chance to form neural structure? In effect, positive experiences typically flow through the brain like water through a sieve, while negative ones get caught every time making it, as I say, you know, the brain like Velcro for negative experiences, the Teflon for positive ones. And that has a lot of impact in the therapist realm in terms of our clients uh, over-learning from unpleasant or negative experiences and being very inefficient, in effect, at learning from, or creating new structures in the brain from pleasant or positive experiences. 

00:08:25
sp>RichOkay, so, let's-- we're gonna be talking today about that, that kind of um, the knowledge about neural science and how the brain operates, and evolutionary uh, the impact of uh, evolutionary experience on the structure of the human nervous system. And making that of um-- what's the practical meaning for therapists in their clinical work. So, as you-- tell us about as you've been studying this and you've been writing about this, how is your practice as a psychotherapist been changed by understanding these, this, these uh, these basic-- this basic understanding about human uh, learning processes and how the nervous system operates? 

00:09:10
RICK Yeah, I think there're two big changes or two big impacts I would say right off the top. One is um, it's helped me put negative and positive experiences in context. So, to create a little bit of a frame here, negative experiences are inevitable. There's in fact, a place for them in life. In other words, if you think about it, as therapists we're focused on two kinds of things, momentary psychological states and over time psychological and therefore, neural traits, in other words, lasting qualities. Well, so, if in the moment we go negative about the negative, if we develop aversion or resistance uh, toward the negative that's gonna be a problem for us. I mean, if you think about it, one of the main negative factors for people is they don't have sufficient tolerance of distress. And one of the most powerful things we try to help people do in therapy is to develop what's called distress tolerance. Distress tolerance is a major factor in psychopathology. So there's a, there's a place for negative experiences. You know, negative experiences can build up strengths inside. I've done a lot of rock climbing and mountaineering, my experiences there have done me well. You know, there's a saying in medicine: Good judgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgment. Well, in the wild, I've had a lot of experience. But anyway um, all right, on the other hand, there's no shortage of negative experiences in life. It's not like we have to go looking for them. Second, they have-- they're painful to experience in the moment, and they also tend to have pernicious effects over time, in terms of, structure building in the brain. Very often, people are coming to us in our practice who are dealing with the legacy of the structures that got built from their negative experiences in childhood or in certainly, certain events or situations, in adulthood as well. So, that's number one. I've really started uh, thinking a lot more clearly, I guess, about the negative impact really of negative experiences. And have frankly also become uh, I'd say chastened and chagrined and humbled about the amount of time I spent rehashing and rehashing negative experiences with my clients, which because of experience dependent neural plasticity, you know, the famous saying, "neurons that fire together, wire together," if you're just rehashing and rehashing and rehashing past the point that's productive, it's like doing another lap around the track in health, you just dig the track deeper. So, that's one take away. The second take away is been the real power of using positive experiences in building inner resources and building structure in the brain. You know, positive expe-- well, we all need inner resources. We have-- you know, we think about character virtues, executive functions , various attitudes, capabilities, positive emotions, the approach orientation that Dan Siegel and the developmentalist talk about, for example. I mean, these are inner resources. How do we get those inner resources in? How do we install them in the brain? The primary pathway is through, number one, activating positive experiences and number two, mindfully installing them into a brain that's not very efficient at transferring positive experiences into lasting neural structures. So, I've given a lot of thought to actually how to do that in, in therapy, both in the therapy hour and encouraging my clients to do it between sessions. I mean, I think with regard to this, I'll just call taking in the good, as an over-arching kind of umbrella term, and the idea of deliberately internalizing keep positive experiences in implicit memory. That's what I mean by taking the good. I think it like any good thing the therapist do there are four ways to do it. I'll just go through them fast. One, is to just do it on the fly. A lot of-- we do a lot of good stuff as therapists on the fly. So, for example, regarding taking in the good, I'll just slow my clients down, so that they actually stay with and with a positive experience like uh, feeling seen by their partner in couple's counseling or having a sense of their own good qualities or respecting themselves for not getting drunk the night before. So, instead of them rushing on to the next thing I'll just deliberately get them to dwell on it for another 10 or 20 seconds in a row. It's this critical threshold roughly around a dozen or two dozen seconds, and the threshold varies depending on the intensity of the person. If we're not staying with the positive experience past that threshold, from the standpoint of structure building, it's like water through a sieve. It may as well not have happened. So, I'll do that kind of thing informally. The second thing I'll do is I'll just describe taking in the good. I think a little bit of brain science goes a long way in psychotherapy it's often motivating for people, it gives them a sense of why they're doing it, kind of makes them more mechanical and material, they like that. So, I'll describe it, that's all. Just like as therapist we'll mention how people might do relaxation or might-- how they might argue against uh, depressogenic thought. Uh, third way I'll formally take people through it sometimes uh, I'll deliberately do it with them, they know what I am doing. I'll say, for example, someone's having a positive experience, let's say, of their own worth or uh, a sense of strength or a sense of feeling cared about uh, by anyone including me as the therapist. I'll say: "Hey, can we just sort of stay with that a little longer. Maybe right now, you can get a sense of it sinking in. I'll be quiet perhaps for a couple dozen seconds while you just kinda try to stay with it," for example. And then in the fourth way we do any kinda method including taking in the good, we encourage our clients to do things outside of therapy uh, to use these skills, where they are developing skills, in the other 167 hours of their life besides the one hour a week you know that they're sitting in our office. 

00:15:20
RICH Yeah, okay, so, um, now, just to make a link here and to um, give us some labels. So, there's a part of-- an influence on the emphasis on positive experience is positive psychology in Seligman's work you talked earlier about learned helpfulness. Is there--, is your-- what influence in your own work is this framework this uh, which is imp--, has been imperfectly applied within the, the uh, it's more of a research tradition than a clinical method, has that been an influence on you? And is there anything within that positive psychology research tradition that you've found particular useful to you as a psychotherapist? 

00:16:15
RICK Uh, that's a very I think interesting question so, I'll come into to it kind of in two steps. In the first step, as people--, as you and probably many people watching this series know there's been a--, well, I say if we put psychology in a historical frame, 100 years roughly of clinical psychology, ballpark, as we know especially if we have the kind of gray hair that I do, you see the traditions come and go, right? There are these rhythms and there's-- it's the dialect that writes thesis, antithesis, synthesis. 

00:16:50
RICH Sure. 

00:16:50
RICK So, there's kind of currently a backlash against positive psychology or a, or a reconsolidation, if you will. And there've been some recent papers that point out that what's positive in one context may actually be harmful in another. And it's really important to pay attention to context and pragmatic outcomes. Not all pleasant experiences are positive, really. Uh, getting buzzed is a pleasant experience but-- or feeling angry and really just lashing out and letting somebody have it has certain gratification that doesn't mean it's positive. Alternately, there are certain unpleasant experiences, like healthy remorse, that can have very positive benefits. 

00:17:25
RICH Sure. 

00:17:25
RICK So, I think creating context is really important. And then second, for myself, as you mentioned I have a background in contemplative practice especially Buddhist contemplative practice. And as Buddha began his first novel truth is the truth of suffering. There is difficulty, you know, there is stress, there is strain, there is dissatisfaction, there is inevitable discomfort, there is suffering. Um, that's where we begin and it's really important I think, to face that squarely and not use positive psychology um, as what John Welwood called the "spiritual bypass." Or a therapeutic bypass that we skip over the pain. I mean, it's really important I think, to appreciate that what we're talking about here is not the entirety of a therapy, it's just a really important thread I think, in the tapestry of a good therapy. And I'll offer a little context that's really has served me here. I think that the psychological healing, everyday wellbeing, personal growth, and spiritual practice, in effect is like a great bird that needs two wings to fly. The two wings are being with what's there, being with the mind or what's in the mind and working with what's in the mind. Being with is I think more primary. I think it's really important to be able to be with things because you can't always work with them, sometimes you're overwhelmed by them. So, being with, is really fundamental. That's where I think the infusion of mindfulness in the world of therapy has been wonderfully important and kind of a corrective to the emphasis on clinical psychology on very active fix it you know, being with things, working with things. On the other hand, to put it in context, even as big a fan as the Buddha of right mindfulness also included right effort, which is the working with element of the eightfold path. Which involves both releasing negative states and cultivating positive ones. So, in effect, uh, we have three great actions if you will in healing, wellbeing, every personal growth and psych-- and spiritual practice where we be with what's there, release what's negative, and cultivate what's positive. So, when we talk about cultivating what's positive, to me it's only one third of those three. And it needs to be placed in context. On the other hand, sometimes we need to cultivate the positive to be able to be with what's there, or to let go, or release what's problematic. And sometimes as well, people can get stuck in just sort of being with what's there past the point its usefulness and then they're like I say: "Doing one more lap around the track in health. So, it's in this context you know, that I really think it's important to understand uh, efforts to use positive emotions or positive experiences more broadly as a major pathway into building up the inner resources we need for dealing with the negatives. You know, they all work together in a positive kind of cycle. 

00:20:25
RICH Okay, so what-- a few moments ago you were describing the four different ways in which you're working with positive emotion and helping people create resource states. Do you-- and some of those seem very much as you, as you were putting it, on the fly, let's just slow it down, you know, you hadn't had that experience before that's-- that sounds like that must've really felt good to hear that from your wife. In a-- as you in your practice as a therapist are there um, are there any uh, are there some particularly systematized ways in which you've found it's helpful uh, to work with positive emotion and to help people create resource states? And are there particular kinds of presenting issues, a certain kinds of clients who you've discovered this, this really pays dividends? 

00:21:25
RICK Right 

00:21:25
RICH For those, for those folks? 

00:21:25
RICK Yeah, well, I think about that in a general way and also very concretely. So, first, generally, thinks happen in the brain at different paces. For example, the flow of verbal thought goes by very quickly in terms of the brain but it often doesn't produce any lasting structural change especially down in the emotional and motivational systems of the brain that are where the real action is. Our clients don't tend to suffer with they think, they tend to suffer what they feel and what they want. And so, if you are interested in creating lasting changes in terms of the bottom line of what it really feels like to be in their own body in their own experience, in their own life in terms of in particular emotional motivation. Uh, it really pays, it really pays off to think about what's actually going to make changes. And very often the flow of verbal thought is too fast to make the changes that happen much more slowly down on those lower structures. Which, remember, as we talked about in the very beginning here, are very similar to, in humans, to those in monkeys, squirrels, and rats. So, in terms of trying to get down into those lower systems uh, they're slower and they're very-- they're much more based on sensation and emotion and feeling. And so, one thing that has been a take away for me is that it has been humbling to appreciate how many uh, conversations I've had with my clients where they're talking on that have had no benefit. Or even more humbling, the number of times my clients have been listening to me spew my infinite wisdom and that's had no benefit either. So, I think a lot more about what's actually gonna build structure deep down in the limbic system of the brain. That's a general point. And then concretely, how to do it. Um, I'll give you a couple examples here. The first uh, the first one is that in my own formulation with my clients, I'm really asking myself frequently, often many times a session, what's the, what's the key experience that will really help here? Not the key idea but the key experience. It goes back to uh, a well known saying from a psychoanalyst in the 30s. I don't think it's an accident it was a woman, as kinda rebuke to the male psychoanalytic, psychiatric uh, establishment, she said: "The patient does not need a new idea," in other words, not another interpretation. "The patient does not need a new idea the patient needs a new experience." So, I think about what would make all the difference in the world to this person, which often, frankly, is what would've made all the difference in the world back in the day. You know, back in childhood or their last job, their last relationship or their last weekend with their friends. What would've made all the difference in the world? So, number—so, in terms of formulation I'm zeroed in, what are the key experiences? And then very pragmatically and sometimes shamelessly, I'm really resourcefully looking for any way, shape, or form to, in effect, activate those key resource experiences either in the therapy hour, or outside my office, and then through the methods of taking in the good install that key resource experience over and over and over again into underlying neural systems. So, to give a concrete example, um, I'm thinking right now of a client I am working with who's a guy in his 50s, I'll disguise some of the details here, he's actually very handsome in a classic male way, but he has body dysmorphic disorder. It's really difficult for him to uh, recognized his own natural good looks or to realize more fundamentally, he's heterosexual, that that's the least really of what women are interested in you know, generally speaking, particularly in a long-term relationship. And he has a huge heart, he's very intelligent, he has a good job, he's a great guy. But it's really hard for him to experience that because of his own childhood issues. So, I'm thinking that key resource experiences for him are things like a felt sense of worth, or feeling cared about, or capability, or strength, or other assets, other virtues. So, whenever he is having an experience like that or there could be an opportunity for one. Maybe the verbal narrative track is tripping along at 90 miles an hour um, but then I'll slow him down, I'll say: "Uh, could you say more about that? Or what happened then? Or what were you feeling then? Or what would you be feeling now as you speak about that?" Very standard therapeutic methods, no rocket science here but very directed at changing the brain one positive experience at a time, a dozen seconds at a time. And so, that, that would be an example of him. And then sometimes, to take it a step further, in what I call the fourth step of taking in the good, which is the optional step. Where we, if we choose pair positive and negative material together in the field of awareness of mind. So that, since "neurons that fire together, wire together" the positive material seems to increasingly infuse the negative material. Sidebar - I did not invent the fourth step it's routine in psychotherapy, I'm just really interested though in how to do it very skillfully and effectively to maximum benefit to teach your clients how to do it on their own. So, for example, with him if he's having a, let's say, valued and useful key positive experience like feeling cared about or recognized, maybe by someone that he works with or the wife of a friend. Um, if he's having that kind of experience we then sometimes will talk about him connecting that experience with the sense of being a little kid inside that has been wounded and unloved. And um, so, he's aware of both those things and awareness at once, very important technical point, it's important to have the positive material be prominent. Because, otherwise, the person is then hijacked by the negative. 

00:27:40
RICH (inaudible ) 

00:27:45
RICK Yeah, and building neural structure the wrong way we want-- it's like a valve, we want it to go one way. 

00:27:50
RICH Slow it down for a bit cuz this sounds eh, something that could be of uh-- it seems very interesting and of value to lots of us. So, how might you set it up with this-- in this particular case? What's, what's-- take us through the uh-- perhaps a bit more methodically how you set up to make sure that these experiences are in balance and what exactly is the process? 

00:28:15
RICK Yeah, well, maybe that will be a way into the-- I'll just give a quick summary of the four steps and by the way, very freely offer um, I've got slide sets from all one-day workshops I do on this for therapists on my website www.rickhanson.net. Anybody can download that and are-- they're able-- 

00:28:35
RICH We'll get to that at the end of our conversation. 

00:28:35
RICK Yeah, so, I'll just give the headline version here. 

00:28:40
RICH Okay. 

00:28:40
RICK Four steps to taking in the good. First step, have a good experience in the first place. Sidebar - either we are having a good experience cuz we're having one in the flow of life. Let's say my client is just having an experience of inner strength after doing a workout or very often we deliberately activate or call up a positive experience by thinking of a good fact uh, in our life today or just noticing one around us or recalling something from our past or, if all else fails, and this is a tricky one but if all else fails, imagining things that actually never happened but are very healing to imagine. For example, I've had clients who never had good parenting. They really never did have loving care giving but it's valuable for them to imagine what it would be like to have had the kind of loving care giving and then as a result self activate states of mind that gradually become installed as important resources in their brain. So, anyway, back to the first step. You're having a good experience in the first place. Second step, we extend it in space and time. We make it last, we stay with it10 or 20 seconds in a row, and we also help it fill our body uh, and become as intense as possible. And then in the third step, which overlaps with the second, we're priming memory systems by intending and sensing that this positive experience is sinking into us, going into us. Lots of cognitive research shows that you can intensify uh, memory, which means building neural structure through deliberate intention. We probably all had the ordinary experience of that in a beautiful situation we remind ourselves. Remember this one, this one's a keeper. All right, those are the three basic steps of taking in the good. In the flow of life they typically take a few seconds, maybe a few dozen seconds at most. Uh, but in learning them it helps to unpack them as in learning any skill. And in the fourth step, which is optional, we deliberately-- so far, I've only spoke of positive experience uh, in the fourth step we deliberately hold an awareness both of positive experience and some kind of negative material. Uh, I'll tell a personal story about that if you like a little bit later on. Um, anyway, so, we hold a positive and a negative together in awareness at once and we do it in a way that's very skillful. So, we want to make the positive experience prominent. In effect, we want the bulk of neural processing in the substrates of consciousness to be dedicated to that positive material, so that when "neurons that fire together, wire together," the positive material is predominantly infusing the negative material. Then when we stop thinking about it, in other words, when the negative material--, which by the way it's a very important point, is not necessary and usually it's not a specific memory, in other words, it's not an explicit memory that's activated, it's implicit 1 memory that's activated. In other words, a kind of uh, sorrow or a sadness or a feeling that is young of not being seen or a sense of frustration deep down or an expectation, that if one speaks from the heart or swings out, that one will be smack down. You know to quote the Japanese proverb: "The nail that stands out gets hammered down." So, we have that expectation in the body that if we speak up or speak truth to power, if you will, we'll be whacked. Uh, those are the kinds of things that are the-- what I mean by negative material, mainly. Although, sometimes there's specific memories of-- that are explicit recollections. Okay, so, what happens then is we sense, in addition to having the positive material be prominent in the fourth steps, we kinda sense, we guide it, there's intention in directing it into the negative material. People experience this in different ways and talk about it in different ways. They might feel it like water going into a sponge or a sense of a golden soothing balm salving old places that have been bruised and wounded. I actually had a therapist in a workshop I taught once, the therapist talked about imagining that her very loving and nurturing qualities were embodied in a very maternal way holding in her lap the little girl she once was who felt wounded and unloved. Many different ways to do it. so then when we're done doing the fourth step, which again often is 10, 20, or 30 seconds later, there's a reconsolidation process, and memory systems, and during that reconsolidation phase, uh, there's a lot of research especially recent research shows uh, structure building is quite vulnerable to intervention. So, we now have positive inputs in the negative memory trays that go with it during reconsolidation. And then for bonus points, if people want, again recent research shows that if um, over the next 5, 10, or 20 minutes the client let's say, deliberately or the person deliberately reactivates the positive state alone, that will particularly disrupt the reconsolidation of the negative material in implicit memory and gradually progressively soothe and replace it. That's pretty great. I mean, of all-- I've been around the block a long time as therapist and a teacher and what not, and as a personal practitioner 35 plus years and this one is in the top five for sure of all the methods I know and have personally experienced. 

00:34:25
RICH I see, okay. Now, so, how uh--, just as we have spiritual practices and people do their meditation every day or whatever their other kinds of practices may be. So, is this a uh, a practice? Are you describing perhaps a, a session or an experience that someone has with you perhaps where you're guiding them through this four stage process? Is it um-- does it get any uh-- is it more of a-- or do you encourage your clients to have daily practices where they do something like what you've just described for us? 

00:35:05
RICK Yeah, um, in sessions uh, as you've said uh, in those four ways the therapists do anything really with clients uh, especially the first three. Um, I definitely will routinely slow things down uh, to do this fourth step sometimes without explaining why I am doing it. Sometimes in a context in which there's been a mutual understanding of why we're doing it. Uh, and sometimes I'll do it quite formally with the client. And I think it's really quite powerful. I was trained psychoanalytically so, I get-- I pay a lot of attention to the transference and the impact on frame of therapist guiding people and teaching methods. I think with definite pitfalls there to be watched out. But just because the path has pitfalls on either side of it doesn't mean we don't walk it we just try to avoid the barbs and brambles. Okay, outside of the therapy hour, oh yeah. And this goes to my notion of antidote experiences. Which again, I think much like the fourth step or the other steps of taking in the good, I think are used informally uh, or implicitly often in therapy. What's been interesting to me is to try to call them out explicitly and then get more skillful at them. So, in terms of antidote experiences let me create a fast little model here. As the brain evolved in three basic stages you know, reptile, mammal, primate, the inner lizard, the inner mouse, and the inner human--, the inner monkey, as we did that the brain also was learning how to meet three needs or pursue three aims for motivations. To avoid harms, approaching rewards, and attach to others. So, we have these three fundamental motivational systems. And that's a very useful organizing structure for what we're doing in therapy for many reasons including it takes to us to thinking about how to categorize the issues of our clients. In other words, most of DSM-IV soon to be DSM-V can be sorted into issues of reactive patterns in each of these three systems. For example, issues of trauma or anxiety disorders or anger disorders fall under the avoiding harm system. Um, addictive disorders uh, including subtler versions such as overwork, fascination with your personal to do list, I have to watch out for that myself, that would fall under the heading of approaching rewards. And then a lot of the personality disorders or ordinary experiences of loneliness would fall under the heading of attaching to others. Okay, I should add that uh, issues of loss often depression also fall under the heading of approaching reward, so there's a loss of rewards. All right, so, in terms of that uh, if you think about people's issues, as I said, they often fall into those three categories--, one of those three categories. That means that their antidote experience, the particular vitamin C if you will for their own kind of scurvy in a sense in the brain um, could also fall into one of those three systems. You know, if you're anemic you need iron, vitamin C won't help but if you have scurvy, you need vitamin C, iron doesn't do much for you. So, for example, with my client either informally or often quite explicitly we'll talk about what might be for them key antidote experiences. That would be available to them to increasingly activate and then internalize and then reactivate and then re-internalize in a wonderful positive cycle in their life outside of the therapy hour and in their life after we terminate therapy altogether. So, for example, um, If a person has a history of feeling let's say, traumatized or unprotected then uh, key experiences of feeling strong and protected and relatively safe are their particular vitamin C. on the other hand, let's suppose someone has experienced losses or been frustrated with (inaudible ) for whatever reason including maybe having had serious health problems that were um, disabling or limiting, well for that person experiences of efficacy including small ones including reaching for the cup one wants on the table and putting the amount of salt one wants in ones food. Those can become in everyday life opportunities for activating that particular um, key resource experience that's that person's vitamin C. You know, the experiences that our patients or clients need not the ideas. And then last, if a person, like me, frankly, um, have lots of experiences of not feeling attuned to or seen or recognized or included or really valued growing up, opportunities there, my vitamin C and other people's vitamin C in that category are key antidote experiences like feeling included or seen or liked in small ways or large or appreciated recognized even cherished or loved. So, when you know what your key antidote experiences are fantastic because then life is this, is this wonderful opportunity really in everyday life typically in small and mild ways. But uh, half a dozen or more times a day to really take in those key experiences and brick by brick gradually fill the hole in your heart. 

00:40:25
RICH Hm, so, this is great! So, that this is a new one I mean, the idea of the antidote experience. And what you're describing here, what you're concretizing, what you're operationalizing is what we often talk about very metaphorically as psychological healing. We're going-- we're offering a healing experience to clients. Clients are coming in and often the idea that, that can get very mushy. So, you have a far more uh, precise and enviably brain based map for describing what you mean by healing. I don't know if that, that, that's a term that uh, you would apply but it's certainly--. So, all this seems very interesting and extremely useful to me. Now, I just want to get a little more. So, part of what-- is this part of homework with clients? Or just in the sense our lives-- most of our lives are practices of one kind or another anyhow. And often they are practices-- negative practices of rehearsing you know, self denigrating statements to ourselves and we don't recognize those as a practice. But I uh, in terms of how you work and use what you're describing, would it be typical intervention for once you've identified with a client what that antidote experience, what their particular psychological vitamin C happens to be that becomes a uh-- they have a-- developed with that a set of practices where they're doing what you've been describing for us. 

00:42:00
RICK Right. Uh, I guess I think of healing-- and I never really realized this before so, I'm having a new thought, live, anyway-- 

00:42:10
RICH Great! 

00:42:10
RICK For a change, thank goodness! 

00:42:10
RICH (inaudible 

00:42:11
RICK Anyway, I guess, I think of healing in terms of those three steps. You know, where we be with what's there, we release what's problematic, and we cultivate what's positive. So, you know, healing for me means being able to step back from this pain in a very mindful and spacious way. And then to gradually release it, to let it go, to help it move on. And then to build up over time the alternative (inaudible ) replacing. In other words, I guess to use a metaphor here uh, if our troubles are in our garden. Uh, in the first phase we observe the garden mindfully and try to see what's there with as few reaction to it as possible, you just be with it. In the second step, we pull the weeds. And then third, we plant the flowers. (inaudible ) important here, you know? And so here we're talking about planting flowers but it's only one part of the healing process. And I really try to attend to all of those. Specific though to planting flowers, yeah, I will definitely talk with my clients and they vary. I think this where, for example, well known methods of cognitive behavioral therapy uh, can be employed directed at the activation and then installation and then reactivation of these positive resource states of mind. And people can do it in formal ways in terms of little daily diaries, or uh, you know, gratitude checklists or things of that sort. Or they can do it much more informally. Uh, I have clients very often when they get into this uh, they will report back to me these key positive experiences they had. And I gotta tell you, Rich, it's often really very moving for people including sort of tough minded, often no nonsense types, ranging from the business version of that to the blue-collar version of that to the busy Mom version of that just-- and yet they say: "Wow! I Had no idea how many moments are actually available to me in the day where I could have a small, good experience. You know, I got a load of laundry done, I got the kids to bed." uh, I-- relief is an underrated positive emotion, I finished my day of work, coffee taste good, chocolate is good, you know, people are nice to me, that yeah! And they're happy for the possibility for feeling good. And the second thing they talk about is how motivating it is once they start to tip into this. Because the pleasant experiences that I am talking about here, it's just a subset of what we do in therapy but an important subset. These pleasant experiences are rewarding in their own right. I think the major issue in therapy is motivation, really. You know the classic line how many therapists does it take to change a light bulb? Only one but the light bulb has to want to change. It's both lame and profound. And how do we help our clients want to change. Well, one great way to do that is to orient them to the value of every day mildly pleasant experiences. Um, as both pleasant in their own right and a major pathway to healing including building up you know, good resources in the brain. 

00:45:20
RICH Hm, so, in dealing with the stresses and the strain of being a therapist and all the occupational hazards that we experience in working with people, who at least initially, before we uh--, they move on in their healing path, are bringing in a lot of pain and suffering, how has this influenced the way you take care of yourself? How you maintain yourself in your practice? You avoid compassion fatigue and other occupational hazards. 

00:45:50
RICK Yeah. Before I answer that, if I could, I have one last little thought about what I was thinking. 

00:45:55
RICH Okay, great! 

00:45:55
RICK I think also, as in much research on, on therapy shows, it's that implicit factors, the non-specific factors that often make the most difference. And in the process of taking in the good, this general process of cultivation of the positive that's the third aspect that I am talking about in path of healing, growth, spiritual practice, well-being, and so forth. Anyway, implicit in that are several good things. One, is people are being active and resourceful rather than passive, inert and (inaudible ). Which is I think implicitly particularly valuable especially these days when so many people feel pushed around by powerful external forces; globalization, your pension plan going away, crazy political system, etc. The second that's implicit in this is a stance of being for themselves, of treating themselves like they matter. Cuz there's an inherent kindness or self-compassion or self-advocacy, they're on their own side. They're not against others but they're for themselves when they take in the good. And that too is a particularly important implicit uh, resource. Uh, especially for people who've very often in therapy have not felt like they mattered enough to others. So, I wanna finish with that. 

00:47:20
RICH Well, let's stay with that thought for a second. We'll come back to the other question. Cuz I uh, I really like where you're taking this. So, it has occurred to me uh, as we're talking and before this conversation that the environment, the physical environment, the emotional environment of psychotherapy so often is under-nourishing. And that we-- I'll speak generally and folks who are listening doing something quite different I'm not talking about you. But this very verbal channel is often (inaudible ) just words. How underutilized experiences of the arts, of music. So therapy is a under-nourished experience so the implications of what you're saying about antidote states and bringing it seems to me it says a lot about bringing imagination bringing about enhancing the environment both in terms of the activity level of the client and encouraging the agency of the client. But really what you might, might use-- the kinds of uh-- listening to a certain piece of music, watching a clip from a movie, we have this uh, little treasure chest on our desks that we're both talking through to each other of all these things that we might begin to bring into the therapy experience. So, I'm just curious to see you in your own practice or are you aware of other therapists who are beginning-- who are thinking along the lines that you're thinking? Which seem to me very exciting! And then taking it the next step. 

00:49:05
RICK Rich do you mean bo--, oh, you probably mean both. For therapists ourselves when self-- you know, self care. But in particular-- 

00:49:10
RICH But, I am thinking, I am shifting a little bit to that to focusing more. But yeah, in terms of we can apply this to the question that was on the floor about uh, self-care before your answer got me really thinking about uh, the, the enhancing the therapy environment and the resources, the imaginative, artistic, emotional resources that we bring to bear on the relationship. 

00:49:35
RICK Yeah, when you start in a sense you work backwards from. If you start by thinking about what would make all the difference here? What's the key (inaudible )? What's the key resource that would enable the person to tolerate the experiences that we need to get at for healing? Uh, what would really ground what so far and eerie-fairy master's thesis about their own neurosis. 

00:49:55
RICH Okay, right. 

00:49:55
RICK So, we're thinking about that. When you work backwards from that , like I was saying in a sense, life becomes this enormous game board. This vast, to use an artistic metaphor, palette of colors that clients can draw on resourcefully to create those key experiences. And very often the kinds of things that are going to enable them to activate those key experiences are found in uh, areas of life that we wouldn't normally think about, I think as therapists as resources, like working out at the gym, or mild physical pleasure. Mild physical pleasure is a phenomenal resource for activating a positive experience. For people who are clinically depressed, particularly severely depressed, it's kind of if all else fails go to. Sidebar - I think that using methods of taking in the good uh, are actually effective for dysthymic disorder and mild to moderate depression, but need to be used very carefully with uh, severe depression, because often people cannot self-activate a positive experience. And also methods like the fourth method, the fourth step of taking in the good need to be done very carefully with trauma. People who get hijacked by the negative cannot do that fourth step of pairing together. That said, um, boy, physical pleasure um, a hug, doing art, listen to music, being happy, happiness is skillful means in everyday experiences. Your own team winning. Uh, I hope I am not offending anyone here but when the San Francisco Giants won the World Series back in the day I was very, very, very happy about that. Of course, it's a great teaching in impermanence there. Anyway, so yeah, definitely. And then for self-care for therapists, I think it's very important to avoid compassion, fatigue, and so forth. To really look for opportunities especially the small mild everyday opportunities in daily life for feeling good. You know, when you orient a life in this way you see that it's kinda like you're bestrewn before you, strewn before you are all these pearls that normally you just step over or barely notice. But now, you can go through life with a big vacuum cleaner sucking them into your brain. I didn't want to go too far with that metaphor you know, it's a little disgusting but you get the basic idea. 

00:52:15
RICH All right, well, I'll pair it with a positive so it doesn't have a negative impact. Now, in the-- so, in the one of the uh, the findings I think of the positive psychology people talk about is happiness having a some kind of a some kinda of a set point that we have-- that people-- that all kinds of circumstances having in people's lives uh, sometimes seemingly very positive sometimes devastating. And there's this very provocative research that seems to show that given a certain amount of time following these kinds of experiences people's happiness their sense of well-being in the world stays relatively constant. Now, what you're describing which tend to takes us into a somewhat, a different direction it seems to me, in that we have a far more ability enhance that set point than with this kind of skillful use and understanding of things like antidote experiences and taking in the good practices. 

00:53:25
RICK Yeah. 

00:53:25
RICH So what's your take on that, that finding about well-being set points and uh any other research that-- 

00:53:30
RICK Hedonic treadmill . Yeah, definitely so, you're talking about the Hedonic treadmill and in the research community actually there's be a fairly significant push back against that um, finding. Which it's like a lot of things. You know, an interesting finding that is uh, sort of uh, sensational gets a lot of media attention but the kinda careful details that come on its heels sort of get ignored. Two points here, first of all, negative experiences tend to have a much more lasting impact than equally intense positive ones. It takes a lot longer to recover uh, from a negative experience and return to your previous resting state than it does to go back to your resting state from a positive experience, first of all. And second, it's interesting how often just our language forces us to generalize to all the members of the class a social science finding that's essentially about the average of the group. So, even if the average person tends to return to their fundamental thermostat setting if you will, their Hedonic setting after a substantial period of time, usually measured in months sometimes years, even if the average person tends to return to that setting, that doesn't mean that that is everyone's fate. And it doesn't mean that that's necessarily the outcome when people make skillful and sustained efforts toward healing. As we're talking about it here in terms of being with what's there, releasing what's negative, and building up what's positive. Uh, and there's tons and tons of research that shows, as you've been a fantastic champion of for many, many uh, years now, tons of research shows that there's a kind of dosing effect in uh, well-being and mental health as much as there's a kind of dosing effect in exercise. The more you do, the more skillfully you do it, and over a longer period of time you do it typically the more results you're gonna get. And that's the case here, you know, as Barbara Fredrickson and other researchers have shown, as the mindfulness researchers have shown , as many other researchers have shown that by focusing on practices one, for me, big category of which is working with positive experiences and skillful ways that are neurologically informed. Um, by doing those kind of practices over time you really can gradually change your brain for the better, you really can make structural changes in your brain which then translates to what we care about which is we fell better, we function better and we treat other people better. 

00:56:05
RICH Yeah, okay. So, we're just about out of time here. you've given us all kinds of very interesting and, and provocative pathways and doors that people may be interested in opening and finding out more about your work and other kinds of resources. So uh, we made a brief reference to this early so, where do they go to find out about things they might read, training opportunities and so on. 

00:56:35
RICK Sure, if I could though, I'll just say one thing fast which is that people routinely underestimate the value of positive experiences. And when you start orienting this way as a therapist it tends to surface a lot of very interesting obstructions like feeling like they don't deserve a positive experience, or that it would be disloyal to a parent who's been depressed, or that if they feel good they'll lower their guard or lose their edge and whap that's when you get nailed or it would violate their gender socialization or be at odds with their cultural upbringing. And um, I think that generally speaking we don't have clients who are uh, vainly or like Pollyanna only looking at the positive. We have people typically caught up in the negativity bias. We could really you know have a corrective balance here by tilting towards the positive which would just level their own personal playing field. So, that said uh-- 

00:57:25
RICH So, what you're pointing out and it seems like an important thing to let me just underline it before you go on. It's in that it's not so straightforward. It's not so uh--, it can be tricky and we need all of the skills and then our understanding of some of the paradoxes o human relationships and the way our minds work in order to uh, go down this road with our clients. 

00:57:45
RICK Yeah, I think for every one person who has this sort of only positive thinking, only think about the positive sort of stuff uh, we've got ten people who are caught up in um, the negative excessively and of course, to underline the point here, I'm not really talking about positive thinking, I'm talking about positive experiencing cuz that's the pathway into inner resources or a key pathway. All right, my own shtick. So, what do you want to know, anyway www.rickhanson.net website chock full of freely offered resources, slide sets from many workshops I've taught, talks, video and links to other good things. So, that's a good place to go and then of course, if they're interested in my book, two books really, Buddha's Brain and also Just One Thing that's the most recent one. It's a collection of 52 little short and sweet practices that are very accessible to anybody Just One Thing a little practice you can do including taking in the good. 

00:58:45
RICH Okay, that's great! So uh, duly noted and people will also find this on the fulfillment page on the-- for this webcast a link to Rick's website. Remind folks again about our comment board here's your chance to one, just crystallize your thoughts here, what stood out for you? Listening to today's conversation what was the learning for you? What positive experiences perhaps that just got triggered? Whatever it happens to be , put it into language that's going to enhance your own personal learning. Let's uh, sharing that with a group will take this conversation and move it one step further so, I encourage all-- everyone listening. This conversation it begins with Rick today but the impact will really be this continu-- this conversation and these ideas continue to ripple afterwards. Rick has graciously agreed to take a look at the comment board, he may perhaps respond to some questions as uh, if he is so moved. In any case, I really encourage everyone to participate on the comment board. Rick, I can feel my (inaudible ) at some point has been altered. I uh, perhaps not permanently but certainly for this afternoon. So, what an interesting conversation and lots of very-- you have a very fresh perspective on this old, old craft, this traditional craft. So I salute you and thank you for uh, participating in this webcast. 

01:00:15
RICK Oh, thank you and I salute you, Rich. Honestly, you've made an extraordinary difference in the field of mental health over multiple decades. 

01:00:25
RICH Thank you. all right folks, so that's it for right now. Uh, take your moment and cultivate your Hedonic set point and um, I hope you-- there's a lot to chew on, a lot to think about in this-- out of this conversation. In any case, we'll see you next time. But for now, bye-bye.
