RICH SIMON Welcome, everybody. I'm Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker, and I'd like to welcome you to our Networker Series on parenting skills; all you need to help families today. So, in this series, we're gonna look at some of the, both the shifts in families and the experience of kids growing up and some of the challenges of childrearing in our society and, at the same time, the various ways in which this has challenged some of the conventional wisdom in our field and changed some of the ways that folks who work with families and with kids are, what they're doing in the offices. So, to start off our series, we're very fortunate today to have, ah, someone who's chronicled for readers of the Networker over the last 20 years; the changes in the family and the change in some ideas about how to be helpful therapeutically. The one, the only, Ron Taffel, direct from the west side of Manhattan. Ron, welcome. 

00:01:10
RON TAFFEL What an introduction. Well, thank you very much. You're the guy who provided the, ah, platform so you're really introducing not just me but you as well. So (crosstalk inaudible ) 

00:01:25
RICH SIMON Well, that was the important part. I wanted to make sure-- 

00:01:25
RON TAFFEL You want to make sure you got yourself in there. Okay, I got it. 

00:01:25
RICH SIMON Well, temporarily we'll forget me. So, um, what we, there's a lot of ground to cover in, ah, in this, ah, our conversation today. So let, let's start us off, ah, the most recent point of reference. So, ah, those of you who may not be aware, Ron is, in my view and I'd think the view of many of the readers of the Networker, the, the, not only, ah, a terrific therapist and ah, a thinker about psychotherapy, but he's one of the leading, perhaps the leading, Anthropologist of, ah, in our field today and has really be charting these changes and the experience of parents and kids over the, this last, ah, 20 years and, and longer. But he's been writing for the magazine for, ah, ah, a good deal more than actually 20 years. So, in this, in the, um, in our, ah, ah, the January issue of the magazine, ah, you wrote a, a piece about, ah, some of the these, the, the challenges to parental authority, but particularly there's a tone that you're discovering, a kind of ah, antagonism that has developed between parents and mental health professions that you're seeing in, in the speaking you do and you're, the work you do at schools around the country. Ah, how did you discover this? What are you, what are you seeing in this shift in the dynamic between parents and mental health professions and school professionals these days? 

00:02:50
RON TAFFEL Well, wherever I speak I usually speak to both parents, in the evening let's say, and to faculty, teachers, ah, professionals during the day. And of course I work within a very large professional, um, community and it's impossible. It's impossible not to notice when you speak to parents how the feel either judged, blamed, misunderstood, by most of us. Um, and this is something that I hear whenever the, the, ah, faculty or whenever the profess--child professionals are out of the room. So then I go, let's say that, ah, afternoon and I speak to the, to faculty or child professionals and they will say to me, Ron, can you do something with these parents? They're absolutely impossible. They're not raising their kids. They're handing them over to us to raise. They're not teaching them any values. We can't teach anymore in the room. What's going on with them? And you get this thing where you feel like you're literally like one meeting has been bugged and mic'd and the other group actually has been hearing the other one because they say the same thing about each other. And that's why I've wanted to, that's what we talked about and, ah, what I wanted to start at least the last piece about and to talk about, um, the fact that I feel that in some way we professionals have to take a, a gut check. We had to, had to really start to think (inaudible ). Do we, do we understand parents in the same way, the way we questioned ourselves whether we understood women during the feminist era, whether we understood men during the men's liberation time? I wanted to write something that would ask, ah, the question do we understand parents the way they really experience this world because of how much has changed? And my feeling is that no, we have a long way to go. 

00:04:40
RICH SIMON So, one of, what came out in your piece, and what was very striking, was this shared experience of both, ah, ah, ah, teachers, school personnel, ah, mental health professionals and parents, is this sense of incompetence, the sense of not being able to feel like you're, um, that, that you're able to control what's going on, that you're not, you, you're feeling like you're not being effective; in the case of parents, as parents with their kids and as teachers feeling like they're not really getting through to kids. Is, is that your experience of it and, and if so, what is that, what's behind that? 

00:05:20
RON TAFFEL We laughed at therapists; therapists feeling, ah, how, how competent or incompetent we feel. 

00:05:30
RICH SIMON No, no. Include, include-- 

00:05:30
RON TAFFEL You're including them, yeah. Um, see, I think that the, that the secret of the piece is that, um, and of the way that I see things, is that I believe that therapists and parents actually have and share a similar degree of a sense of a lack of authority, with, in terms of kids, in terms of the treatment. And that in--one of the reasons we end up blaming each other is because there's a certain degree of identification that therapists have with parents and their own difficulties, and that parents have with therapists. Now, what's changed? And this is very important. We don't have to get into this right not but I feel that parents have begun, when it comes to the world of psychotherapy, to become much more assertive, much more assertive in terms of what they need, what they want; that there is a sense of discontent, of rebellion, ah, almost like when we were talking about it the, ah, the 99%, ah, ah, ah, sense that parents, ah, they, that they feel that there's much more that they can do. They don't have to depend just on us. And to the extent that we, as therapists, can really begin to grasp their experience, help them concretely with their kids. They're not gonna continue to do, that feel as, um, um, ah, disenchanted, and there are many reasons why they feel this way, with therapists, with schools. Ah, because they're starting to act much like in an iTunes world. They're going around us. They're starting to do many things, parents, to create their own way of helping each other and they'd like much more from therapists. I think it's a, actually it's a terrific group of parents to work with. I think they're more open to change than I've seen in decades. 

00:07:20
RICH SIMON So, let's focus in on this question, 'cuz this is, this is what we're calling our session about reclaiming the parental authority and we'll, ah, we'll talk a bit about that. We'll talk about some of your ideas about what, how therapists can help parents and kids in the therapy room, and then some of these other ideas about, ah, how to empower parents to do things beyond the therapy room. But let, let's start with this question of authorities. So, what's in the, in the context of our time, what's the nature of things that, what, what's happened to parental authority? And you've been working as a psychotherapist for some time now, for maybe three and a half decades-- 

00:07:55
RON TAFFEL Right. 

00:07:55
RICH SIMON By my calculation. Um, so what is, what shifted here about the, ah, parents experience of authority and their ability to exert authority within their families? 

00:08:05
RON TAFFEL Well, since about the, ah, early to mid '90's, when we started to chronicle this in the Networker, there's been a shift, a demographic shift. Parents now are basically post-boomer parents and by being post-boomer parents the bottom line is that they don't really buy and believe in the notion of authority the way we were taught, ah, to think that parents should have it. They don't, they don't buy it. They don't believe it. So when you, when you walk, walk into a therapy room and you try to get a parent to establish and create more authority with their child, you're, you basically have an audience that doesn't believe in it in their soul, in their gut. 

00:08:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:08:50
RON TAFFEL And, so that part of the therapeutic process is to get parents to understand that this is actually something that is necessary in families. They know they should, or they know they might. Ah, they, they remember it from when they grew up. Like, I ask a lot of, I ask a lot of, um, parents can you imagine what would have happened to you if you had said one thing to your parents the way your kids talk to you every single night? What would have happened? Then I also ask is there anyone from social service in the room? So, be careful what we say. 

00:09:20
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:09:20
RON TAFFEL Because all of them say no, absolutely not. So, part of the thing that I, that I think is important for us. as therapist. to grasp is that we need to be able to get parents to buy into the notion of authority and to make it fit to post-boomer parents in a post-boomer world where it's become much more complicated. I mean, it's, the, the whole setting is much more complicated and fragmented then it ever was when you and I grew up-- 

00:09:45
RICH SIMON Yup. 

00:09:45
RON TAFFEL Or when, um, ah, late bloomers grew up, grew up. 

00:09:50
RICH SIMON Yup. Okay. So, so, so part of it is this, this generational shift and you're written about this, the non-hi-hierarchical family, the vertically challenged family as your, ah, you (inaudible ). So, so how does that effect--so let's, let's, ah, people are listening to this and they're practicing therapists. So how does that effect how you operate as a family therapist and as a therapist who also spends time talking to, to kids? What's, what's different about what you do today, perhaps than what , what, how you were trained, ah, in the more classic family therapy traditions? 

00:10:30
RON TAFFEL I don't immediately impose a template of hierarchy onto the family. I don't say, ah, come up with rules. Um, I don't assume that they're going to even be able to figure out how to do that. 

00:10:40
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:10:45
RON TAFFEL If they even want to. Um, I, I basically work from a position where I think that that's artificial. I think that it was good for another age. I think it was absolutely right for the '70's, the '80's and just part of the '90's, but that it doesn't feel authentic to most parents and most kids. Most parents can't do what we ask of them. Like, I'm, I'm hearing all the time when people come to consult with me that the previous therapist said just take away all the, their electronics. 

00:11:10
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:11:10
RON TAFFEL Just do it. 

00:11:10
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:11:15
RON TAFFEL As if, as if that parent were able to do that in one fell swoop. 

00:11:15
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:11:15
RON TAFFEL Um, the days of being able to impose this kind of authority on to kids as, and onto parents as a therapist, I think actually don't exist anymore unless they're working within a structured program. Like, if you're in a wilderness program you can do that. 

00:11:35
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:11:35
RON TAFFEL But in, in an agency, in an office, um, in a community center, you don't have that kind of buy-in or power. So, it's, it's changed the way I approach families and I try to basically, ah, look at it from a perspective of I want them to have and create genuine authority, authentic authority. Not one imposed by me. That just isn't going to work from my experience. And that's the beginning of treatment is me trying to figure out, um--and I can over this with you if you want to-- 

00:12:05
RICH SIMON Yeah, let's--tell us-- 

00:12:05
RON TAFFEL Get into a couple of specific areas more. 

00:12:10
RICH SIMON (inaudible )here is how that sounds. So when a family's coming into you and this is a, one of our post-boomer families or just a, a family that's in the authority quagmire of our time, take us through a session and how, what is it, what are those early messages you're trying to--in addition to finding out about them and taking in what the situation is. If we were to encounter you as ah, if we were in that family and, and were to have a session with you, some of the things that you say, some of the ways in which you organize that experience. 

00:12:35
RON TAFFEL All right. Now we're just talking about authority now. 

00:12:40
RICH SIMON In this, in this partic-- 

00:12:40
RON TAFFEL In this, in this, okay. So-- 

00:12:45
RICH SIMON We'll get to other issues. 

00:12:45
RON TAFFEL So, basically, basically most parents are held hostage by their kids-- 

00:12:50
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:12:50
RON TAFFEL Or held hostage. They're, they're literally held hostage by their fears and by their children. So, one of the first things after we get to know each other and I find out, ah, what their kids are like and what their kids like, I don't get into right away what, ah, the problems are, what the presenting problems are, because in this world that is not a way to make a real connection with either a child or a parent. So, I want to find out what the kid likes, what their interests are, what they're passionate about, how they spend their time, how they spend the time online. Only after a while do I begin to start putting together a genogram, and I start asking them, ah, kids and the parents, about the specific issues. 

00:13:30
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:13:30
RON TAFFEL So, one of the things I ask the parents and I might do this in the room alone with them, or I might sometimes do it with the kids there, is what are you afraid of? What are you afraid of with your kids? What are you afraid will happen? 

00:13:45
RICH SIMON Ah! Um-hum. 

00:13:45
RON TAFFEL And you get incredible, incredible material right away. Um, straight from their heart, I'm afraid that there gonna end up if, ah, I've laid down a law about curfews at night, they're not gonna talk to me, or they'll get oppositional. They know what, they know all the diagnosis. They're really very familiar with them. 

00:14:00
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:14:00
RON TAFFEL Ah, they'll get more opposition. They, they'll, they won't come home at all. If, ah, if I don't let them stay home from school for one day then they'll literally, ah, stay out for a long time, 'cuz there are a lot more kids actually are refusing school. I've, I have found this, ah, throughout the country. Um, they won't make it to college. They, ah, I feel that if I see something going on and I talk to anybody about it--this is critical. My kids will never talk to me again. So someone comes back--well, (inaudible )serious stuff. Someone comes back and says, listen, um, you know, Jenny has an eating disorder but mom, you can't tell anyone. She's in danger but you cannot tell anybody, and this mom or dad, ah, is in a really impossible dilemma. When I was calling, when you and I were talking the almost impossible profession, they're in an almost impossible dilemma. What do they do? They, they feel responsible. They want to say something but their kid kind of means it, that they won't talk to them or trust them, which is one of the biggest fears that parent's have. So I get into, um, finding out what their fears are. And in the genogram I literally--it's, it's, um, I do two additions to the genogram that we're all taught and that you were taught, I'm sure, you know, as well. Um, and, so I do the regular genogram. I also do what I call a tempergram, which is, um, um, I try to find out what the temperamental constellations are of this kid, the identified patient. 

00:15:35
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:15:35
RON TAFFEL And we all, we all, I think, I mean, we, we started this discussion, the field you've been helpful, ah, to say the least, um, in, in, in promoting this discussion about temperament. And so I, I do a tempergram and I find that the issues, let's say it's a tenacious kid, a really, actually stubborn, strong-willed kid, ah, or one who is depressive, and I do a tempergram and see that, you'll see it, ah, ah, happening and pre-exiting and going on from one generation to the next. But I also do what I, I don't know how to call it any, ah, more, ah, gracefully, but, ah, a fearogram; fear. F-E-A-R. 

00:16:15
RICH SIMON A fearogram, okay. 

00:16:15
RON TAFFEL Fear, fearogram. So, I find that, like, this parent, let's say, is worried that their kid is gonna just, if they don't do homework one night and they can't make them do it, they're gonna stop doing homework forever, start cutting classes, end up getting kicked out of school and end up, ah, fin-finally being, ah, addicted to some sort of drug and out there on the streets. Why? When I do a tempergram, of course, and a fearogram, I find out that in fact an Uncle had the same history. Ah, one of the, ah, parents, ah, ah, parents themselves, ah, were, ah, had the same exact history. And so I want to be able to find out what has gone on historical-- 

00:16:55
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:16:55
RON TAFFEL That makes parents afraid, and then the second part of it, and you can break in if you want to ask a question about that, but the second part of it is I also want to find out how their kids are literally holding them hostage. So, so, the 21st Century kids, they have become masters of saying the exact thing-- 

00:17:10
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:17:10
RON TAFFEL That is going to scare the hell out of their parents, make them afraid, negotiate endlessly, back them up against a wall because their parents are literally afraid that what their kid is saying to them is true. I've, ah, had kids that say things like knowing that this, it, that mothering means the world to this mother, saying before their adolescence, much worse when they're adolescents, you're the most un-motherly person I ever met. To that, to many mothers. I've heard this dozens of times. Um, to another one, ah, if you, ah, if you tell anyone this--this is like what I was saying before--I will never, ever, ever speak to you again. Now, that is a fear in the present. Um, these fears hold parents completely at bay and I need to work with them to find out immediately what they are and to try and then release them from being held hostage. 

00:18:10
RICH SIMON So, so let's just shift it for a moment. We'll, we'll continue on but I'm, I'm curious do you ever get into a conversation like this with the kids about what their, their fears are, and what does that sound like? 

00:18:25
RICH SIMON What the kids' fears are, are most of the time--and it's shifted. It used to be that they were afraid of things happening to their parents. They were afraid, ah, Dad might have a heart attack or, ah, at another level, might be sent to jail. Um, ah, they're afraid that something would happen to their sister and brother. Those are still there, but they're more afraid, and it's especially so--it's interesting. In the early years of high school they're really afraid of their standing online, standing online; online with other kids, meaning on Facebook, ah, where they are in terms of-- 

00:19:00
RICH SIMON (inaudible ) 

00:19:01
RON TAFFEL The way their standing literally is, right. It's hard to, to get how important this is. When we do surveys with kids this is, besides their academic success or failure, this is the thing that pops right out. And the interesting thing is, is that it's really, really, important to them, starting in 8th, but it hits a peak in 9th and 10th grades, that's, ah, that was a shocker for me to see that it made total sense. So they're very afraid, themselves, of where they are at any given moment, any given night, because it can change from one minute to the next-- 

00:19:35
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:19:35
RON TAFFEL In terms of the rest of the social group. And that turns out to the biggest thing that I, ah, that I hear from them besides whether they're making it, ah, in, in school. Interestingly when I say to them what bother you the most is really what's going on relationally in their social life and in their world. 

00:19:55
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:19:55
RON TAFFEL It's not most of the time what's going on at home. I guess either way, the last thing I ask them, when I first meet, ah, kids, is so tell me what annoys you at home. What is it that's--'cuz I--annoys is a, a word, it's, it's, it translates for every kid. 

00:20:10
RICH SIMON Right-- 

00:20:10
RON TAFFEL I want to know what annoys you, yeah, has a lot of [non-English narration]. And then they'll begin to talk about it. It's not what they come in for and one of the things that I think makes it possible for me, even with all this white hair, um, to, to be able to talk to kids and have them talk to me is because I want to find out what's actually going on in their lives. So I do meet with them alone; not just with their family. And what I find out in terms of their lives is almost always, and this is what creates a relationship that actually works, is about their, what I call their second family. 

00:20:40
RICH SIMON Yeah(ph). 

00:20:40
RON TAFFEL Their family that their peer group, the pop culture and, ah, that gets me into their world. If Freud, Freud said the royal road to the unconscious was, was dreams. 

00:20:50
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:20:50
RON TAFFEL Right? With kids the royal road to the unconscious is, is the second family, their pop culture. Yeah. 

00:21:00
RICH SIMON So, so let's, let's, ah, spend a moment on that 'cuz this is, that you, ah, introduced this term to me at least, I, I know you coined this term and wrote about this. What is it about 20 years ago, 15, 20 years ago where you began to talk about the importance of the second family and also inviting the second family into the therapy room? 

00:21:20
RON TAFFEL Into the room, right. It was, ah, in the early '90's that it was, ah, kids would start to bring other kids to the waiting room, both in agencies and in my office. 

00:21:30
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:21:30
RICH SIMON And, you know, being a little slow on the uptake, ah, this one kid brought a friend of his over and over and over again and he'd sit in the waiting room and wait until he came out of the office. So finally, one day, as I said being a little slow it took me a while to get it, I said do you think you want, do you want your friend to come in? Do you want Johnny to come in with you? 

00:21:45
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:21:45
RON TAFFEL And Johnny just jumped up and ran into the office and all of the sudden I had for the first time my first second family session-- 

00:21:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:21:55
RON TAFFEL And that, for quite a while, ah, helped me to learn 'cuz I would start inviting kids in. Um, of course you have to find out in your agency whether this is, ah, this is okay, whether it's all right in terms of, ah, state guidelines. Um, and I would find out from them talking together who was really the kid in the second family that needed help. Very often the identified patient, just like it was in the family, the first family at home, that's not always the, the real patient. 

00:22:25
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:22:25
RON TAFFEL Right? So, in a second family of the peer group in pop culture, very often the sickest kid is not the one you're seeing. 

00:22:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:22:35
RON TAFFEL The one, the one that you started to see does have a lot of trouble but they also have friends that are in way worse trouble, way more trouble. And I began to, to see this by having people come into the office and that's, you're right, that's when we began to write about it. It was '95 or '96 when we wrote that particular piece. 

00:22:55
RICH SIMON Okay, yup. So, and, and so, so the, the, the second family-- we'll get back to parents in a moment here, but finish this idea. So, the, the, with the second family it was a source of inspira--of, ah, information for you. Um, and also of a broadening your view of kids in their real life and what was important as opposed to what our therapy theories had lead us to believe was important in kids lives. Was there ways in which, did you, ah, try to intervene in addition to getting information, how did you, did you work with this second family in any particular way? 

00:23:30
RON TAFFEL Very carefully. 

00:23:30
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:23:30
RON TAFFEL Um, very, very carefully because there are real, um, guidelines and rules as to who you can see and who you can't. 

00:23:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:23:40
RON TAFFEL Um, I'd, ah, get permission from, ah, the kids to, to, ah, to speak to their parents. Um, that I was, in fact, asking their friends, ah, to come in. Ah, that's in-incredibly important. Then I would be able to talk with the parents because many of these parents were very concerned and who were talking about authority and, and felt very, ah, in some way, disempowered because they saw things going on that they didn't know how to talk to their friends, um, ah, parents about. 

00:24:10
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:24:10
RON TAFFEL And so, ah, I helped them to be able to talk to their friends, the parents of these other, of other kids. Um, that is by the way, how I started to work more with parent groups and how I started to move beyond the office, not just to focus on what went on in the office clinically, but to move some of the work or a lot of the work that I do outside of the office and into the community and we can talk about that if we, ah, if we have time-- 

00:24:35
RICH SIMON Okay, so before--'cuz that's, that was a, a very interesting aspect and both of us have gotten a lot of feedback from (inaudible )offered a new way of understanding families and helpful with them(ph). Let's go back to this, ah, your role with families. You gave us a little flavor in this, this tenuous grasp that parents have, that they have some, any degree whatsoever of control with their own children and how edgy they are of, ah, pushing it. So, in terms of what you've been working with, what you've learned about how to help parents begin to reclaim some sense of authority with kids in a change, a changing world, a non-hierarchical world. What have you learned? What is it that you do these days that perhaps you didn't do? And, ah, let's focus for the moment on if you, when you're working directly with parents. 

00:25:30
RON TAFFEL After I, um, found out what they're afraid of I want to release them from those specific fears to get to what I call, um, for them to be able to have real, I mean it moments where their integrity can start to, to really be felt by their kids. See, do you see what I'm saying that I, I want to move away from just focusing on rules and something from the top down, to focusing on some, on ways to get parents authentic, um, authoritative self to start to emerge. It's there for most parents and the first step is to see what's holding it back, what they're afraid of. The second step to start to feel, is to get them to express what it is they actually believe in. 

00:26:15
RICH SIMON Hum. 

00:26:15
RON TAFFEL Parents, we don't ask that. In therapy we don't really ask very often, well what do you believe in? 

00:26:25
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:26:25
RON TAFFEL You know, I know what you think you should be doing or what you think, what we're telling you to do, but what do you believe in? Um, an example of that would be, um, one of this, ah, I think I wrote about this last, ah, piece, but it was, ah, we described this kid as in, ah, these are all composites, of course, but this kid is an uber jock. 

00:26:45
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:26:45
RON TAFFEL Very athlet--athletic kid. Um, but lost of drinking going on. Lots of, ah, you know, weekend escapades; enough that, ah, he was getting to the edge of having trouble in school and that he was perhaps in danger of being, ah, kicked out. And I, part of what I then focused on was I took mom--and I say this now to parents all the time--if it wasn't for everything around you what do you really believe in about his, about, let's, let's focus on, on his drinking. She said, I know, I know everybody's telling me that this is just what kids do and what is normal. 

00:27:20
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:27:20
RON TAFFEL And what is normal is part of adolescence, but I don't think he should be drinking. And I, and I, myself, felt--and I don't know what you feel--I felt a lot of it, you know, some of it is normal and, you know, try-trying to, to be realistic here, although I understood what she was saying was really not good for this particular kid and for most kids. And I said what would you do? I would, I would say to him you can't drink. And everybody has been telling me that that's insane. 

00:27:50
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:27:50
RON TAFFEL And I actually in some way hesitated but then I said, no, this is what this woman, this mom really believes. And so I said, all right, let's figure out how you're gonna do that. It may not work, and it probably won't, but it seems, as all the sessions that it became clear, this is what you really believe. So she went ahead; she, she confronted her son. She said I do not want you to drink. I know I can't be there all the time but this really matters to me and I want to explain to you why it matters to me. And, of course, there were three generational reasons why it mattered and she really believed it. She said I don't care what anybody else says. This is what I want even though I can't control it. She then went one step further. She took him down to a police station. I didn't, this was not our therapeutic planning. She took him down and she had him see what it looked like when kids got thrown in. Now, this was, did this kid stop completely? No. But it was the first authentic, I mean it moment that she had with her kid. She actually, she actually said for the first time, this is what I believe in. And if you go back to some of the early tapes, um, some of the Minuchin tapes that, when we were talking before, I thought that the reason that they matter is because regardless of the, of the theater of it, these were parents who were saying I really mean it. I want you to eat, at the anorexic kid, or in one of those tapes where there was an issue of authority, one of the parents literally got out of his chair and stood right over his kid in a very semi-mena-menacingly way-- 

00:29:20
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:29:25
RON TAFFEL Ah, menacing way, menacingly-- 

00:29:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:29:25
RON TAFFEL All right, however, he stood, and you got the feeling at that moment that he meant it. Now, there, there's a parallel here. I often feel that we therapists don't say things in ways that sound like we really mean it. Just think, oh! That, that must have made you feel really terrible, right, Susan? (crosstalk inaudible ) just awful. Or, I think you should try this. Instead of saying I really believe that you should not be hooking up with this person this weekend. I can't stop you. This is therapy, but I really believe this. I believe that learning to handle your feelings, your zone of comfort in terms of your, of your anxiety, for example, that that matters. 

00:30:05
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:30:10
RON TAFFEL Um, we are not that different from the very parents that we sometimes hold in such disdain. Our, our, our field doesn't teach us how to do that. Certain people who are geniuses, and cert--like Minuchin, he, they exude that. 

00:30:25
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:30:25
RON TAFFEL We're not taught that, and yet I think that that's critical for parents to learn. So that's, that's a second thing that I try to get across to parents. The third thing that, that, ah, unless you want, do you want to break in now 'cuz there is a third thing that's critical-- 

00:30:35
RICH SIMON Well, I, I guess--I, let's, we'll get to that in a second, but just what's really striking here, as you're describing this, is the difference between parenting as a role that's assumed, ah, with a lot of shoulds to it but isn't experienced as something that's coming out of that particular parent, that person. And what you're trying to do is get people from this kind of role playing of being a parent in, in the contemporary world, and it's I, I think it's, ah, a lot more of a, 'cuz people have more ambivalence about every role, more choices. And this experience of authentically trying to protect one's child in a way that is a real direct expression of who you are as a person. 

00:31:20
RON TAFFEL You've got it. And, and part of that is because parents have been turned into stick figures, two-dimensional stick figures, because of all the shoulds, because of all the rules, in part because of the diagnosis. Um, there are ways that parents, myself included, ah, very powerful ways, have been turned into caricatures. 

00:31:45
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:31:45
RON TAFFEL And we are doing roles. Um, and what a, an important part of the work is, is to get a child to start to see their parents and feel their parents, his or her parent, as a three-dimensional, real human being with-- that brings a parent implicit authority. 

00:32:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:32:05
RON TAFFEL Another example of this is we don't demand, and this is part of the way that I work with kids, I expect kids, and I expect parents, to begin to demand that their children do this. I expect kids to become more empathic towards their parents. Our therapies are about us becoming more empathic towards children. They have not been about--and this is one of the biggest and main reasons that I wanted to write this last piece with you, Rich--is I wanted us to be able to focus on parents as three-dimensional figures(ph) to put to, in some way, as a field be able to empathize with them more. And my feeling is that, basically, and this is after two children and working with countless kids and families, that kids impact their parents as much as parents impact their kids. 

00:32:55
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:32:55
RON TAFFEL The kind of kid, the kind of kid you get, you know, people say to me, well, do you think I'll be able to continue with this job; people that I, that, um, who I, work for me, after I have my first child or after I have this child. I said, I don't know. It depends on the child you're gonna get. 

00:33:10
RICH SIMON Hum. 

00:33:10
RON TAFFEL Children in their incredibly ways to, ah, to make their presence felt, and especially in a child centered, child-catering world, have a profound impact; much more so than they did two or three decades ago, on their parents. So, part of the work is also getting kids to see, and getting parents to see themselves more three dimensionally, more empathically. 

00:33:40
RICH SIMON And even (crosstalk inaudible )expectation to, as a parent, 'cuz there's, again, ah, the, the world changes. The, ah, professional, ah, helper culture changes. We give different messages. We, we're, we are really over the top about self esteem and then we, as usual, we're, there's always, ah, the overdoing it and you had to, ah, play your child's self esteem and you've, you've written both entertainingly and quite powerfully it seems to me on this and how that went overboard. But this idea that in some ways that, that it isn't part, hasn't been. And this is what struck me about your idea about 3D parenting. It hasn't been part of this, ah, culture that's child rearing literature that I've seen, ah, it, ah, until recently, until perhaps you and I started talking, this idea that the parent really feels like the, there's an expectation the child gets you as a person, a real person in some way. That's not part of the, of the expectation of 21st Century parenting as I experienced it. Is that, is that how you see it? 

00:34:45
RON TAFFEL Absolutely and it's, it's not just an ex--not an expectation of 21st Century parenting. It's not an expectation often enough of 21st Century therapists. The training that we do does not focus us on, and that's, again, be-- I think we need to move further. I think we need to look at how we do not, in fact, empathize with parents deeply enough, with how profoundly they need to fell both acknowledged, appreciated, ah, and I don't mean this in a guilt-provoking way, but gr--that their children feel gratitude, and that they get them. That the, it's not just getting your child. It's that you, you are gotten, so to say, by your children. That they understand who you are. Ah, you know, this was something that you, you, you said to me, ah, a few times that, um, it surprised you some of the connection to the past that I had. And I think one of the reasons is because-- 

00:35:45
RICH SIMON Here(ph)from your Brooklyn childhood-- 

00:35:50
RON TAFFEL Make a mistake. No, it wasn't Brooklyn. It's, it's, you think it's Brooklyn but it's actually a place called Washington Heights, in the heights. 

00:35:55
RICH SIMON Right. Okay. 

00:35:55
RON TAFFEL All right? All right. 

00:36:00
RICH SIMON I stand corrected. 

00:36:00
RON TAFFEL There's a difference, yes. 

00:36:00
RICH SIMON Anything outside of the Bronx, for me, is Brooklyn(ph). 

00:36:05
RON TAFFEL You're, you're, you're rooting for a different baseball team now. That's what it was. 

00:36:05
RICH SIMON That's right. Okay. 

00:36:10
RON TAFFEL Um, so, but one of the things was that it actually mattered how my father just, ah, using him as an example, how he felt. It actually mattered. Now, if we lived within a culture which is so youth oriented and is so child centered, and I don't meant this in a, in a stiff or molistic(ph) anti-child way. We need, we needed to do that 'cuz a lot of abuse happened back then. I mean, and we needed to switch things around and to ah, to show and to understand the, the life and the mind of a child much better. But, what we forgot in the process, was that for a parent not to feel some kind of understanding as to the position their in and, and to go through the, their entire just take adolescence, and never expect that of their child makes them resentful. That's why in many of the surveys many parents will say they'll have, they'll have fewer or no children. We have expectations of parents that put them in an impossibly inhuman situation. And this is not feeling sorry for us; this is just a reality. It's not healthy for kids. As therapists we don't spend a lot of time on this. We really don't. And, I'm glad we're talking about it actually now. 

00:37:30
RICH SIMON So, so let's stay with this, in this practical way that we were focusing a moment ago. So, how is it, what is, what are the kind of experiences that you're trying to help generate when people come to see you; with parents or parents and their kids in the room? How do you then operationalize what we, what we've been discussing. 

00:37:50
RON TAFFEL Right. Um, ah, I want to change the dances to go on at home. That is--and that go on in the office. So, the dances, which is an old structural family therapy concept that I--the way I, I use it somewhat differently, um, and one of the concrete ways that I do this is I ask parents to, to write story, what I call Stories from Home. 

00:38:15
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:38:15
RON TAFFEL And so it would be so, Rich, ah, you know, you're, ah, you're 14 year old isn't, ah, you know, is not coming back on time, ah, is not doing their homework, is about to be kicked out of school or whatever it is that's happening. I want you to write me some stories about things that go on around the house; very short. He said, you said, he said, you said, he said, you said; that's it. We're-- 

00:38:35
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:38:35
RON TAFFEL And I learned, I learned this working--and this is where you get confused--I learned this working in, in Brooklyn, um, with, ah, a families in Brooklyn and I said to them just write these stories. And they said but I don't write well. I said just simple, he said, you said, and so on. They come in the next meeting and from, and I said gimme three or four of these. This operationalized(ph) is that they come in and they would read the stories, I'd have them read it. And they would read the stories to me and the dance, the place that they'd, that they're either held hostage, the place that kids are able to get them-- 

00:39:10
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:39:10
RON TAFFEL The place where they, where they are out of line themselves, or don't get their kids, the way the dance has basically gone out of hand becomes incredibly clear. So, this is, besides doing it in the office, which is basically what old family therapy would do, when you, you know, and I would do it in the office and also get these stories from home. At that point I'd start to change the dances by working both with the kids and with the parents in the room and outside of the room. When those-- 

00:39:40
RICH SIMON Okay, so, as you (inaudible )as you said, so, just, just give us this is, this is, sounds so interesting. So just add a little detail. So tell us what are the kinds of stories that people bring in and then how do you work-- 

00:39:55
RON TAFFEL All right. All right, so, ah, so this mo--ah, single mother, ah, comes in and, ah, she, um, her, her kid, ah, curses at her endlessly, whenever he gets mad, whenever she wants to, ah, do anything, ah, like create a rule or a consequence or even not just then. He gets furious at her, curses her and just keeps cursing at her and she keeps following him, demanding an apology. This is what I learned from the stories, ah, from home. And, of course, when she does that all he does is curse at her more. 

00:40:30
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:40:30
RON TAFFEL And she can't, and, basically this is the dance they, they need to stop. She's asking for an apology from this kid. 

00:40:35
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:40:35
RON TAFFEL And I worked with her for weeks and weeks to get her to stop this dance and she can't do it. So when that happens what I tell the, the, the, ah, students who supervise these that I work with, I say at that point when someone gets stuck it's either some hidden diagnosis we don't know about that we need to find out, um, what's going on, ah, with this parent or with this child, or whether there's a three-dimensional script that's going on. And then so I asked her why are you going after apologies? Why, when you know you're only gonna in some way, ah, have this come back at you? And all the sudden what is this, what, where is this from? 

00:41:10
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:41:15
RON TAFFEL And all of the sudden she's starts sobbing. And she, she starts sobbing and I said what's going on? And she said basically, um, you know, I hadn't put it together. I know this sounds crazy 'cuz I've worked on this a lot but I, I was abused by my fath--sexually abused by my father and my uncle. I've gotten over this to, to as best as I can, but in me, I still want one more thing. I want them to apologize. So at that point I said if you still want your son to apologize when he abuses you, when he curses at you, at that moment she could begin to start working, weaning herself off of following her kid. And of course the moment she did that he stopped walking away from her and he literally said the next week to her, ah, after he cursed at her and she didn't, ah, start to follow him, he said does that upset you when I, when I talk like this? And she, she said of course it upsets me. What the hell do you think I've been trying to get you to apologize for? He said, well we talk to each other all the time like that, meaning all him and all of his friends. And then they had, and she then burst into tears again, and she then talked to him about how this was unacceptable to her. It was just, it, it annihilated her when he did this. This need to change. I want to say one more thing, Rich. We don't, this is another thing I've learned over the last decade. We've put so much emphasis on rules that we forget we're not just teaching rules when we create authority. We're establishing values. If we're talking about authentically creating authority, you're not just creating 12 o'clock as a curfew, let's say, you're cre--you're trying to get across the value that, you know what? I want you to keep your word. I want you, as my child, to keep your work that you are gonna come in. I don't care if it's 15 minutes or 20 minutes. What matters to me here is your word. 

00:43:05
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:43:05
RON TAFFEL When I don't want you to keep pushing me and negotiating with me, I want you to understand that I actually, it matters. It, it, I actually have feelings. At a certain point and there are points that I can't go past. A, a stark example are numbers of kids I know who'll go into their parents' in the middle of the night, literally, and wake them up and say I want to talk to you right now. And these parents, and I know it's hard to imagine but-- 

00:43:35
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:43:35
RON TAFFEL You know, it happens all over the country. These parent's feel like oh my god, I better start talking to my kid. He'll never talk to me again. 

00:43:40
RICH SIMON (inaudible ) 

00:43:43
RON TAFFEL And they'll start talking. So, what's the value? The value is what are you doing? I mean, I can work sometimes for months with a parent to get to a place, what are you doing? I need to work tomorrow. I cannot get up and you cannot literally use me as a piece of furniture and wake me up in the middle of the night just be--or even when I'm about to go to sleep, or when I can't, or just when I come home from work and I need to transition. Because, if you're lucky enough to have a job, because actually, well, it matters to me. It, I feel it inside. I feel it and that should matter to you. 

00:44:15
RICH SIMON Hum. 

00:44:15
RON TAFFEL Do, do you see this? There is a difference between just putting a template on to the family. 

00:44:20
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:44:20
RON TAFFEL Rather than trying to get a parent to feel it and to be able to then, ah, in some way stand for something that they, ah, that they believe in. 

00:44:35
RICH SIMON So, one, one thing that's come across, ah, very clearly for some parents, lots of parents, there's a, a trigger here. They're, they're, ah, they're not behaving. They're not realizing that the ineffectiveness of their own behavior because they're entranced to some experience in the past, like the woman that you just described. Ah, that's not, but the, the, getting parents to come to this kind of I mean it moment, this three-dimensional moment, that's not always the case with parents. So, it, when, is it what's the, is there another kind of, ah, kind of parent where it's not obvious that there's a, a genogram issue here or there's a historical issue but somehow, for whatever reason, they can't bring an authentic sense of I am a parent and I mean it; not just because they have some wound from the past, but for they're, they're just, they're not comfortable as a, in the parenting role, or what, whatever it happens to be. Do you have, do you have that experience as well? 

00:45:30
RON TAFFEL Um, if most times, and I don't know whether everyone will agree with this, in, but in most of my work most parents want to be parents and they want to be more, more authoritative. 

00:45:45
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:45:45
RON TAFFEL They want to guide. They, they want to guide their kids. Um, there are, of course, there are parents who don't. So, um, but most of them, they actually do. This, which, what you just said is a reality and it's also a myth that's part of the way we don't understand the reality of parents. We think they don't want to be parents too much of the time. They're abdicating. 

00:46:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:46:10
RON TAFFEL No. They're afraid, as I mentioned earlier. 

00:46:10
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:46:10
RON TAFFEL They have scripts. There are diagnosis. We didn't talk about this, that the parents, then we have to--parents have issues that they need to, to deal with where, for example, you trying to get a parent to just lay off of their kid. They can't stop. Lay off him. Lay off him. They can't stop. They're not getting through. But, they literally are unable, um, ah, to, to hold themselves back. Often, I'm not saying--this is just an example. I'm not saying this is the reason why all the time, but it may be because they have some sort of, um, self-regulatory issue. Some sort of, ah, hidden affect disorder. All, you can go down the whole range. So, that's another whole area that I'm always looking out for if I cannot break the dance. What here is not being in some way understood about this parent? 'Cuz in their right mind, if they could have had control over it-- 

00:47:00
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:47:00
RON TAFFEL And I can get at it through their fears or the other things we've been talking about, there, there is something diagnostically. It could be going on in one case, um, this mom, ah, gave out seven different, ah, um, things, tasks that the kids needed to do, literally in the space of five minutes. Every five or ten minutes she'd give out a half a dozen new instructions. 

00:47:25
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:47:25
RON TAFFEL So, of course, what ended up happening is we finally got to the fact this mom literally had some kind of self-regulatory disorder that we needed to be able to work with. When that was under control this parent began to rise to the occasion of guiding her kids in a totally different way. Another thing that gets in the way is parents don't know, don't know the facts. And you and I've talked about this, right? I mean, we've talked about how much of an article to include in it, but if you look at our training, we do not teach supervisees, trainees, candidates and, in most of the training centers around the country, and this disturbs me greatly. We don't teach them the facts and the changing facts of adolescence. So, how much authority can a parent say, have, when they don't know what's really going on? 

00:48:15
RICH SIMON Yup. 

00:48:15
RON TAFFEL So, how many kids are, in fact, smoking? How many kids are drinking? Do you know how many kids and when, ah, when it happens that, ah, how many kids start to have sexual, ah, become sexually active and when it happens has it changed? Do you know the facts of adolescent life that keeps changing every few years? So a parent is left in the dark. So their kid says to them, what are you talking about? Everybody does this. 

00:48:40
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:48:40
RON TAFFEL The fact is everybody doesn't do it. 

00:48:45
RICH SIMON Yup. 

00:48:45
RON TAFFEL And not knowing the facts, and us as therapists not knowing the facts, so that we don't have courses that teach therapists-to-be the facts of life of adolescents and, ah, development and childhood, really ends up hurting, ah, parents and their authority. We're teaching them about the, actually I want to say something about it but we're teaching parents diagnosis. 

00:49:05
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:49:05
RON TAFFEL Almost every parent--I don't know if you're aware of this, 50, almost 50% of kids are diagnoses by the time they reach 18. 

00:49:15
RICH SIMON Amazing. 

00:49:15
RON TAFFEL So, when I used to say to, ah, a group of parents when I would talk with them, how many of you know blah, blah, blah, you know, A.D.D., A.D.H.D, O.D.D., all of the, ah, the, ah, diagnostic categories we use, and they used to not know, no. They know now. They know now no matter where I go. So, we teach them diagnosis but we don't teach them what to do. I just came back from working with some, ah, teachers. Teachers aren't taught parenting methods or what the facts are either. And one of the things that this group of teachers just told me literally an hour ago, was saying, you know what? We need to have this written up for us. We need to be able to know what to tell parents about how to handle certain situations at home, certain facts, like what their kids need. And that would make a big difference. We would feel, and this is the word they used, more like we were in authority. 

00:50:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:50:05
RON TAFFEL You see? It's, we all don't feel that way and there are certain things that would make a difference. I, I don't know if that's, like-- 

00:50:10
RICH SIMON So, so let's, let's get to this and we're, we're, we have about ten minutes left and, and, ah, let's get to, ah, where you were taking us towards the very beginning, 'cuz it seemed to me one of the things that really, ah, stood out about this last piece of the Networker that, ah, many, many readers re- responded to so strongly=-- 

00:50:30
RON TAFFEL Yeah. 

00:50:30
RICH SIMON Was you were looking at this, this, ah, this imbalance between this community of kids, as you were saying a moment ago, the second family and these very extended second families of, ah, social media and Facebook and these very elaborate social structures the kids are plugged into. And they get their sense of the norms of the world and, ah, the, the sense of the reality of things because they're taking in all these relationships. And then on, on the one hand--so you have this world, this teeming world with kids and interconnectedness, and then you have the rather isolated world of many, many, if not most parents, where they don't have a connection with other parents. They feel like they're the only schmucks in the world. They're the incompetent ones and all the other parents, and so one of the things that you, ah, did and I think people responded to with a great sense of relief, is you're trying to address that in saying how do we begin to create this experience of community among parents? So talk to us about how you think about that and what, in a practical way, some of the things that you have done as a therapist to encourage it. 

00:51:35
RON TAFFEL Okay, um, I'm, I'm glad we're back, ah, to that piece of it as well. Ah, there's something that, that you need to know and that we've talked about and that everybody else needs to know. That the sense of parents being isolated is starting to change. Parents are not putting up with that anymore. 

00:51:55
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:51:55
RON TAFFEL And so the e--whether they're getting together online with each other so if their kid has a problem with bullies they're plenty of places for them to go online, um, or whether they're doing the sort of thing that I began to start to, to, to help facilitate. Ah, this is starting to change. Parents are not gonna be, and therapists I don't believe should, should think of therapy as basically just happening in the fall walls of the office. So, I, I ask them why this article touched a nerve, which it did. I've never gotten the kind of, ah, of feedback, ah, as I did with this particular piece, but this is what I do out there in the world. It has to begin to create, first it starts with conversations between adults, conversations outside of school and between the, the two parts of the adult community that don't talk to each other enough, which is school and home. I help to create as, um, Alvin Poussaint calls it, chit-chat. Chit-chat meaning natural conversation between parents before, and school, before there's a crisis. You know, we have a lot of ways to talk to each other after, god forbid, there's a crisis, right? Or after your kid develops an eating disorder or has, ah, some issues. But I want to create it before there's a crisis. And so I started years ago to get parents to start creating first, um, ah, what began it was the beginning of parent groups, and I called them peer groups for parents. 

00:53:25
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:53:25
RON TAFFEL And what they were, were, ah, ways of parents getting together, ah, should I--I'm not sure. I heard some noise there. I don't know whether you want to, if that came through but peer groups for parents, parents to get together and talk about the average, ordinary daily parts of their lives. If kids were doing it, parents certainly needed to do it, and the neighborhood of old had disappeared so parents needed to, to come together. 

00:53:50
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:53:50
RON TAFFEL At a certain point, at a certain point, and this is critical, and therapists can be a huge component in this. Parents and schools create a partnership, a partnership together. And what they become together is a community of learners. A community of learners to work on being partners, school and home, in raising kids together. Now what that means, concretely, is that parents, teachers, administrators can get together and therapists can play an incredible role in this because those, this partnership creates events for, that happen throughout the school year, about issues that actually matter, um, to that particular, to that particular community. And who knows the secrets of the town better than the therapists? 

00:54:35
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:54:35
RON TAFFEL The, they, we hear what's going on so events get created and I, I'll give you a couple of examples if you wanna hear them. 

00:54:45
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:54:45
RON TAFFEL Um, where a partnership is formed, this, ah, parents get together with each other, with the administration, ah, in one particular school, and then they bring the kids in. Kids wrote up scenarios of impossible situations that they would, that they, ah, came up with that they would like their parents and teachers to talk together about. And they wrote them anonymously. So these were situations like what would happen if you came home and you found your kid in bed naked with another kid? 

00:55:15
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:55:15
RON TAFFEL What would you do, mom, dad? What would you do? 

00:55:15
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:55:20
RON TAFFEL What would you do if they were, if they were cheating, lifting stuff offline because they have five assignments that night and they needed to have it ready the next day? Um, and they came up with a half-dozen scenarios. There were ten different groups, 200 parents, ten different groups where therapists lead each of these groups and parents talked with parents, talked to each other and part of the administration about how they'd handle this. And did this solve any problems? Maybe, maybe not, but it empowered parents. It began to make them feel like, oh, there's parents here I can talk to, which lead to the formation of more peer groups for parents. Um, in another school there were literally 15 volunteer therapists who came in and helped lead, um, parent discussion groups with the school about bullying, about bullying, about scapegoating, about social cruelty. 

00:56:10
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:56:10
RON TAFFEL In which every part of the system began to talk to the other parts of the system. And the parents were able to identify the fact that, you know, we don't know what to say to our kids. They said to the, to the therapists there, please, give us the words to say to our kids when one of them is being tortured on the bus, on the school bus coming back. I don't know what might, to tell my kids to say. 

00:56:35
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:56:35
RON TAFFEL And what they did is then they created more of these events to figure out together the things that could help kids to get through. That the words that they needed. 

00:56:45
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:56:45
RON TAFFEL In another, I, I don't know if you want me to keep going on, but these were, these are examples of partnerships in action. What happens then, this is wonderful, is the kids start to get involved after awhile, very directly. And in one place, for, ah, as an example, they had a partnership in which the kids did a survey of all the other kids, an anonymous survey of what creates stress for them. 

00:57:10
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:57:10
RON TAFFEL We, you know, we wrote an article at the beginning of the 2000's about the new anxiety. 

00:57:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:57:15
RON TAFFEL And we didn't realize that was right up, right on target. Kids were felling not old, neurotic stress, but the stress of everyday life. 

00:57:20
RICH SIMON Yup. 

00:57:25
RON TAFFEL And so these kids went out, did a survey. They spoke to every kid that they could in the school and then they created a night in which the kids actually told parents who, and believe me the parents were very interested. Hundreds and hundreds of parents came to watch this. The kids told them what causes them stress. And it wasn't the usual parent-blaming that you would think of. This is the amazing thing; that you don't see the blame start to, to get bigger or more. You see it actually start to settle down. So, the par--so they said to, to, things to parents, um, that parents had never thought about. Um, like, we know we fight you but get us to bed earlier. 

00:58:05
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:58:05
RON TAFFEL They said to the tea--to the, to the school we can't do, we cannot have three assignments due the same day. That led the school to start doing a reassessment of assessments. Doesn't happen a lot. It's just beginning but it's happening all over the country. So these, these partnerships move and, and, the notion, you have to have, have the self, um, concept as a therapist to know that part of the therapy frame is not just in the office. Of course, it starts there. 

00:58:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:58:35
RON TAFFEL But then we have a place to move out into and they, and they literally, they want us to be there. 

00:58:40
RICH SIMON Yup, yup. So what strikes me as, as, from what you're, this last piece of what you're saying, that so, seems so powerful and so sensible, is that, that we live lives that are quite fragmented and compartmentalized and, you know, you've, you've written, ah, with, ah, so, ah, in a very captivating way about this life in the old neighborhoods and Washington Heights, apparently, and, ah, in addition to the Bronx, ah, ah, nice Jewish boys-- 

00:59:10
RON TAFFEL Or Brooklyn. Or Brooklyn. 

00:59:10
RICH SIMON And, and apparently in Brooklyn but I don't, I no longer, that has no credibility now so I'm gonna locate it in Washington Heights-- 

00:59:15
RON TAFFEL Yeah. 

00:59:15
RON TAFFEL Where you had, you knew what was going on in your neighborhood. You knew what the parents next door did with their kids. You, and there were, the norms in that world were known and shared, not terribly complicated. It wasn't a very variegated world. And what we're dealing with is literally what you're saying is nobody knows what these norms are. The therapists have a little piece of the puzzle. They get the secrets of the community but they don't get the wider life of the community unless they do what you're doing, going to schools and talking to lots of different parents. So, part of it is creating a world where the norms are, ah, they're not just facts that you read, would read in a book, but people have a sense of the, the norms in their communities. And you have to look at it. It's not--that information isn't gonna just naturally come to you because of the nature of which, ah, the way we lead our lives these days. So part of what, ah, what I'm getting from, from, ah, your discussion, is how do we, how do you create the opportunity for people; have a real life experience where they get this vision of the norm of their community and how other parents deal with things, and what are the realities of what kids do and don't do? Not just a conception from a newspaper story or their worst fears or from their genogram, and the imprint on them of what happens with kids. So, um, in the, in, so, so last--ah, we just have a few minutes here. So, so, ah, before, ah, I'm sure people will be interested in training resources and, and, ah, ways in which they can follow up, learn more about your work, but, but last piece of this, the interview here. So if I, I'm in practice. You know, I'm, I'm still trying to keep my family therapy roots in some ways. I'm trying to keep my systems(ph) perspective. It's hard. It's hard to make a living as a family therapist, to get a family to come in together. So, in terms of, if, if there were a, a couple of things that you would advise, ah, therapists who are sympathetic with this perspective that you're offering? How do I begin to make some shifts in my practice? What might I do, starting small? What might I do differently so I can begin to encompass, bring in this more complicated reality of kids and family life today into the kind of work I do and move beyond just these traditional tools that I've been taught? 

01:01:30
RON TAFFEL I'd be, um, so great, great question. Um, I would be sure that my agency or my, as a therapist in private practice, would approach the school. It's as simple as that. You approach the school and you say there's, and most often schools will approach us after there's been, as I mentioned, a tragedy. 

01:01:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

01:01:55
RON TAFFEL All right. So, then they come to us. That's the typical way. That's not the way, this is a multi-year process. It shouldn't be bit, based on a tragedy. It should be based on the notion that we need to repair our neighborhoods. And, so you approach; you go to the school. Um, whatever your area of specialty is, ah, offer to, ah, do a talk. Offer to meet with, ah, the, ah, teachers. Um, offer, ah, to meet with parents. Do it at first, ah, just because you're doing it because you think it's right. 

01:02:30
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

01:02:30
RON TAFFEL After that what will happen if you are able to get across that kind of, and have that kind of event occur, there will be a hunger for more. And, what I've seen happen over and over again is that people will then invite you, or invite other people into the school and it will start to organically grow into events, into, um, ah, different kind of initiatives that simply were not going to happen with therapists being involved. See, so you become involved with the normal, um, community building, especially between school and home. So, you approach the school with a concrete idea, um, or if they have something going on. 'Cuz what I want you to remember is what I said. This is going on around the country. Parents are doing this. They want to do this with or without us. 

01:03:25
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

01:03:25
RON TAFFEL I think they're better off doing--I think we're better off and they're better off, ah, with us being involved. So, the, the most concrete thing is, I would say, don't just sit back in your office. 

01:03:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:03:35
RON TAFFEL Um, go, go out to the school and say how can I actually be, ah, of help here in getting conversation going? As you and I talk about a lot, conversation is what gets it started and that will grow into events. That will start to create more of a community. What you think doesn't exits out there in terms of community-- 

01:03:55
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

01:03:55
RON TAFFEL This thing of Brooklyn or the Bronx or Washington Heights, is actually happening all over the country. There, it's happening and the, the, the place it's really focused on are two places. They are either faith-centers-- 

01:04:10
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

01:04:10
RON TAFFEL Or, they are schools. 

01:04:15
RICH SIMON Schools. 

01:04:15
RON TAFFEL And whatever it is, whichever direction that you want to go in that makes you comfortable, just leave the office and, ah, you'll, you have something to offer, and, ah, and that will begin this process, ah, will get it started. What is a wonderful thing is what happens is that parents, administrators and, ah, the, um, school faculty start, in a certain way, learning from the same book. We start reading the same materials. We start having the same teachers. And that helps to bring our children together. What we've had so far is we have these sort of fragmented units that are actually learning their, learning their facts from a different source. 

01:05:00
RICH SIMON Yup. 

01:05:00
RON TAFFEL So, of course, we don't see eye to eye about our kids. And so I really think that we can be part of creating a community of learners and a place I go to is the school, local church, ah, faith, ah, centers. Whatev--wherever it is, they, ah, want to hear what you have to say. All right? 

01:05:25
RICH SIMON So, if people who, ah, would like to follow up and read the collective works of Ron Taffel, they can go to your website and what, what will they find there? And, and tell them, and we-- 

01:05:35
RON TAFFEL Yes, the website. (inaudible ). The website is, ah, Ron Taffel dot com. 

01:05:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

01:05:40
RON TAFFEL You'll find, ah, the--actually the, you'll get ideas about some of these areas that, ah, one can talk about and one can work, ah, in the community with. And, of course, um, the books, ah, I don't know if you want me to mention the, the latest, which is "Childhood Unbound," and it's in paperback and it is, ah, authoritative parenting for the 21st Century. Just what we've been talking about. 

01:06:05
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

01:06:05
RON TAFFEL Every, everything we've talked about is in one way or another in there. And, as professionals, there is, um, another paperback called "Breaking Through to Teens," which is, ah, psychotherapy for the new adolescents or 21st Century kids. That's on the website and, um, also, ah, some of these ideas, topics that we talked about are right there for people to, to be able to think about. And they can get in touch with me and I will try my best to get back, ah, back to them. 

01:06:35
RICH SIMON And speaking of which, ah, those, ah, ah, we would like to invite you to respond to this conversation on the comment board. You'll see on your screen the, where the, you can, ah, respond. Take a moment for your own benefit so you crystallize what is it that's about for you about this conversation. What'd you learn? What did it remind you of in your practice? What, ah, what, what is it that, ah, what questions you may have? Ron has graciously agreed to at least come up and look at what's on the comment board and if he is so moved, as long as he doesn't have to write an encyclopedia, he'll respond to perhaps some of the comments, but in any case, the important thing, ah, as in all, all these conversations--I say it over and over again, but it's always true-- what's the, what's the ripple effect? What's the conversation? And Ron has this particular effect on his, his regular, ah, contributions to the magazine to really start a conversation in our professional community and I'm, I'm sure this conversation today is no exception. Doctor Taffel, now that I've, I've learned, ah, I'm, you're a credit not only to a mythical Brooklyn that I made up for you, but Washington Heights. So, ah, you're, you're a credit, your credit to your community as always, ah, ah, real delight to have a conversation with, Sir. 

01:07:50
RON TAFFEL Thank you Doctor Simon. 

01:07:50
RICH SIMON From Brooklyn. 

01:07:50
RON TAFFEL No, actually from the Bronx. 

01:07:55
RICH SIMON The nice, Jewish boy became, well, not medical doctors, but we're doctors of some sort. And we can at least address each other as doctors, though I don't think either of us use that title very much in our, our day to day lives. 

01:08:05
RICH SIMON No, no. 

01:08:05
RON TAFFEL Um, that's it for the moment. Ah, see you next time on, ah, this webcast and others. Ah, ah, bye-bye to everybody for right now. 

01:08:15
