THINKING ALLOWED with Jeffrey Mishlove 

00:00:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome, I’m Jeffery Mishlove. Our topic today is memory and suggestibility. With me is Dr. Michael Yapko, a clinical psychologist and private practice in San Diego. He is also the Director of the Milton Ericson Institute in San Diego and the author of six books including Trans work and Suggestions of Abuse, True and False Memories of Childhood Sexual Trauma. Welcome Michael. 

00:00:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Thank you very much. 

00:00:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's a pleasure to be here with you to discuss a topic, which I think is… is becoming of increasing concern to people and… and it's the issue of the reliability of memory and… and the ways in which memories can be affected by suggestions particularly in the psychotherapeutic setting. 

00:01:15
MICHAEL D. YAPKO I think anybody watching this program has been seen countless stories in the media now, all over television radio, newspapers and magazines, because now we're been asked to examine a little more critically what we really know about memory, what we really know about suggestibility and what we really know about the suggestibility of memory. 

00:01:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… And what we’re learning is that memory is really quite a flexible thing, it’s… it's the mind does not work at all like a computer in the sense of… of reproducing memory inputs with perfection. 

00:01:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO, PHD Suggestions of Abuse Correct and we have had that analogy now for many years of the mind as a video camera and that all we have to do is stop and playback the images that have been incorporated into our minds through years of experiences and what we are finding out is that that’s not an accurate representation at all and in fact memory is very prone to many kinds of errors and errors through suggestion are just one type. 

00:02:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… May be we can step back for a second and try and define what memory really is, as if it’s not like computer memory, it’s not like video memory, how… how can we portray it? 

00:02:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, the phrase I think that best captures it is that memory is reconstructive not reproductive, that in fact memory comes from a variety of sources and basically our memories can be very reliable, but that it can also be very unreliable. So we are trying to understand more and more of what are all the different factors that influence the quality of memoires and now what we are finding out it is… it includes things like the person's mood, the person's expectations, the person's pervious history with other kinds of experiences similar to what’s happening now, the person's degree of emotional arousal and how pumped up they are, what else is going on at the same time, background noise and… and many other such factors that… that determine the quality and quantity of memories that a person establishes. 

00:03:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And… and I suppose what’s really relevant here isn’t just memory, but it’s the whole process of how do we forget as… as well. How do we retrieve how do memory sometimes interfere with each other. 

00:03:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Right, you know we’re are looking at a very complex process. Memory has been studied know for almost a 100 years, but it’s really only been in the last 10 years or so that any really good quality studies have been done to address the questions of how do we remember, how do we forget and much of that research has taken place in neuropsychology and it really has not yet filtered into the world of clinical psychology, which is really the world that I operate, because clearly what happens in… in my professional practice and the professional practices of most therapists people will come in sit down and they will say some variation of this happened to me, when I was 5 or this happened to me when I was 10. 

00:04:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… Well, Sigmund Freud really setting up the… the… the first theoretical framework for… for what has become psychotherapy suggested that there were many unconscious factors that could affect memory. 

00:04:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO That’s true and some of what Freud had to say has been borne out over the years through research and through clinical experience and some of what Freud had to say about it is terribly dated and is in many ways obsolete. 

00:04:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… 

00:04:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO So the… the standard that Freud said is not really the one that I would encourage people use now as a current model of understanding. 

00:04:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Freud originally lets, with regard to childhood reports of… actually adults that they had sexual memories from their childhood; he discounted these as fantasies. 

00:05:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Right and that has lead to many problems you know, there… there are a couple of issues in that particular question that you’re asking and one is why don’t people remember much from their childhood in general and the so-called ah… childhood amnesia, that was assumed to be a psychologically motivated that there must have been issues and conflicts going on in childhood that somebody would repress or suppress keep out of their awareness and then the other issue is when people come and report episodes of incest, episodes of sexual abuse from childhood are they real or they fantasy. Now the fact the Freud deemed them largely fantasy has had a very lasting impact that has been very detrimental to the field, because what we know have come to realize of course is that not only does incest happen, but it happens far more frequently than we ever imagined, but for the first three quarters of the century people assume that wasn’t happening, that these… that… that when someone came in and said this happened to me, they were very likely to be ignored and… and their allegations dismissed as a product of sheer fantasy. 

00:06:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And… and I suppose it’s fair to say for the record that the real challenge to Freudian thinking on this issue came from therapist who had a feminist orientation and… and felt that he was discounting the reports of women. 

00:06:20
MICHAEL D. YAPKO I think that’s true. I think that feminism has played a huge role in starting to redefine our understandings of what happens in families, what happens in healthy families versus unhealthy families and what sexuality ultimately is about and redefines our understandings of parent child relationships in which there are elements of sexuality and I think we’re deeply indebted to them in that regard. 

00:06:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Thinking Allowed Hmm… hmm… So on the one hand I suppose we have the… the classical Freudian view that the reports of childhood sexual trauma are almost certainly fantasy and on the other hand there’s… there’s also a point of view that would suggest that these reports are almost certainly accurate memories. 

00:07:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO You’re right about that and… and that concerns me a lot, because what it represents that you've just captured so well is the extreme polarity in the field. You have at one end of the spectrum all the individuals you say you have to believe every report no matter how absurd or no matter how questionable the circumstance were in which the report was made and then you have other individuals who question everything. Who… Who believe nothing, who dismiss it right away and of course the… the… the extremes never serve an understanding of reality very well and so really what I’ve been trying to do in the work that I’ve been doing is try and help people understand both sides of it, which is that abuse happens with far, far to grade A frequency and at the same time it's also true that under certain conditions there are false allegations have come above and it… it seems to me that what we really have to do is create an atmosphere where people can be believed when they come forth with these reports and that we make sure at the same time that no one is creating these kinds of memories unintentionally. 

00:08:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I think this is a crucial point, because as you’ve written and I think most people would probably concede most therapists would certainly concede when a client comes into a therapist office and… and reports a memory the tools that are available to that therapist or to the client to determine whether or not the memory was an accurate memory are… are very limited. 

00:08:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Extremely limited and we have to be careful too about the… the… the conditions under which this interactions takes place. You see for most individuals who have been abused at least as far as the data currently show they know now and they have always known that they were abused. They may never have talked to anyone about it, but they have always known about it and so when somebody walks in sits down and says this happened to me there's no basis for discounting this person or disbelieving this person and to me one of the most serious charges that… that I hear leveled against some therapists is they will dismiss it out of hand as being fantasy and here's this person dealing with some of the worst things that can happen in life and they are being isolated again. They are being abandoned again by the one person who should be in a position to help. I think anybody who works with abuse survivors knows how very important it is to be believed. But now we are dealing with a different circumstance. Now we are no longer just dealing with the condition in which somebody comes in and says this happened to me. Now we are dealing with conditions in which someone will come in present symptoms and not specifically present a history of abuse in their background and then it’s the therapist who says, well(ph) your symptoms seem to suggest that you were abused as a child and the person says I don’t have any memoires like that and then the therapist says well you know that’s how repression works. So here's a… a strange situation that’s been evolving over the last few years of therapist doing this kind of work and so I… I want to make a very clear distinction for viewers between those individuals who come in know now have always known that they were abused versus those who are assumed to be repressing on the basis of their therapist perceptions. 

00:10:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So that there are two issues here that I think we want to try and look at clearly one is the issue of repression. Is it possible to have been traumatized and then to totally repress the memory? And the other issue I think we need to look at is can memoires be created through suggestions in… in particular by a psychotherapist? 

00:10:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, the simple answers are yes and yes. If we… if we take the first question first can someone repress, the answer is yes. What we are still needing to find out about is under what conditions and who and why. There are many things that we don’t really understand about repression at this point, we don’t understand who repress and why. We don’t know from what age repression is possible. We don’t know why some individuals repress episodes of abuse that have been known to happen in this person’s life and they never recover the memories and why somebody else retrieves the memory in a fairly accurate form 20 years later. We don’t know what types of memory recovery techniques working with repression contaminate the memories by their very use. There're… there're many things… 

00:11:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:11:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO …that we don’t know and so there's a… there's a lot to be said for this question about the nature of repression, but I think in a general way I certainly want to validate the observation that there is both clinically and experimentally plenty of evidence to suggest that repression in one form or another exists. 

00:11:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm. 

00:11:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO And then if we look at… at the second question about the… the way the therapy works with such individuals and what the role of suggestion is in this process I think that we have to be very careful in the use of memory recovery techniques when repression is assumed to be present and so that’s much of what I’ve written about as making sure that therapists recognize into the fact that they can unintentionally create the very memories that they then have to treat. 

00:12:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So when you say memory recovery techniques let… lets be a little more specific. 

00:12:20
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Okay, well let's… let's follow the scenario if we can, someone comes in and says I have these symptoms, maybe it's depression or anxiety or poor self-esteem and the therapist following a symptom checklist that has really no reliability, no validity whatsoever, but it’s enough to apparently to satisfy the therapist says (inaudible ) you seem to fit the profile of somebody who was abused. The individual says, I don’t have any memoires like that. 

00:12:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Let… let me just stop you what you’re saying if I hear you correctly as that we don’t have a valid profile for people who have been sexually traumatized or abused in childhood. 

00:13:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO That’s correct. But unfortunately there have been published in a number of places these very simplistic self-check inventories and it includes things that are nothing short of outrages that… that… that qualify someone has been suspect of having a history of abuse. For example, one checklist includes things like if you avoid mirrors, that if you steal, if you’ve poor self-esteem, if you have difficulty trusting people, things that most people can relate to that… that if you look their checklist you can say, yeah I fit that, yeah I fit that and yeah I fit that, gee I didn’t think I was abused but maybe I was. And once those seeds of doubt are planted, the person can easily start to convince themselves that, yeah this must… this… this explains things, this might have happened. And that’s an important point, but it’s at that point when the person starts to think, this is a possible reasonably explanation for my symptoms, then come the memory recovery techniques. Now we start using techniques like hypnosis, guided imagery, visualization, projective drawings, sandtrays, dream analysis, all kinds of techniques that individual seem to place a great deal of faith in that practice these kinds of techniques not realizing that these are the most projective, highly responsive to suggestive techniques… to suggestive techniques that there are. 

00:14:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:14:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO And their… their level of reliability is so low, and of course that’s why tools like hypnosis and even things like sodium anatol are considered to be so unreliable that they are not admissible in court and they shouldn't be in the therapy setting either. 

00:14:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So, what you’re saying fundamentally is… is that in practically any therapeutic interaction there is a great risk that the therapist who is holding a certain theory and… and may suggest to the client things that will cause the client to respond in a manner that confirms the therapist's theory. 

00:15:10
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Sure, and… and of course this is not… this part is nothing new. You know, when… when people were in Freudian Analysis at the turn of the century they would have Freudian dreams and if they'd want I see Carl Yung they would Yungian dreams and… yeah, and people end up in essence when they go to therapy they're learning a theoretical and philosophical orientation of the therapist. And there are times when that can be very useful. Obviously therapy helps a lot of people and a good therapist can be worth his or her weight in gold. But at the same time, anything that has the potential to help has an equal potential to hurt and so part of what I’m encouraging through the things that I write about is how do we better make the distinction between techniques that hold greater potential to harm people by absorbing them in that particular believe system. 

00:15:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! It seems that historically what's happened is… is that we’ve… we've come to realize that sexual abuse is far more common than we thought it used to be and now there are therapists, who… who have theoretical orientation, which is that sexual abuse is the cause of the problems that are coming into their office. 

00:16:10
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Some of the stories I can tell you. You know, I was just in London and I filmed a documentary for the BBC and part of what they did was an exposé about a clinic in London, that literally no matter what problems somebody comes in with they walk out believing that sexual abuse that’s been repressed is the underlying cause. And… And their checklist was even more extensive than the one that I was describing earlier. They included things like acne in theirs, so that if somebody came… They sent in a producer, undercover, who presented irritable bowel syndrome, and right on clue the therapist said, you know I think you’re going to be very surprised to discover what's underlying in that particular problem. Now, when you have that kind of one-size fits all approach to therapy, you are potentially dangerous. You know, I think it was Abraham Maslow, who once said, "If the only tool that you have is a hammer then everything around you begins to look like nail." And I think that there is a great potential for harm in that respect. 

00:17:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… Hmm…hmm… Well, I suppose particularly so, in… in that, the allegations of sexual abuse are very damaging to… to families, whether or not the allegation is true. 

00:17:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO No question about it, that here we're seeing something that holds far more destructive potential. You know, therapy has always had a difficult time in many ways proving its own value. You know, when… when you look at somebody who’s been in analysis for years and then turns around and makes bad choices, foolish choices, or somebody who's been in various therapies and gotten worse as a result. I mean, these were the stories that stand out in people's mind that… that make them wonder about the value of therapy. And… And again I… I want to make of point of repeating that good therapy is invaluable and good therapists are invaluable. But at the same time we… we certainly want to exercise caution and exercise judgment and not just immediately get absorbed into a particular person's belief symptoms simply because they have a… an advanced academic degree or… or something like that. 

00:18:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, if I’ve been through hypnosis and now I’ve… I've a recovered memory of… a memory of some sort of sexual activity going back to childhood that would fit the social definition of sexual abuse, I may feel very… very convinced by the memory, because it may be accompanied by strong emotions, it may be accompanied by very detailed visual images and auditory images, perhaps even smells and… 

00:18:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yes! 

00:18:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And other sorts of sensations, so it… it could have all of the dramatic qualities of… of a real event. 

00:18:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yes, and that’s really in many ways what's so confounding about hypnosis in particular. Now, I… I work with hypnosis a great deal, have published extensively, know a lot about hypnosis and… and that’s what… what makes hypnosis such a powerful therapeutic tool in the right hands. Hypnosis is invaluable as a… as a way of absorbing someone in a particular belief system, a particular mindset, a way of looking at things that helps them do what they want to do. But it’s precisely for the reasons that you mentioned that it’s so vivid and so rich and so emotionally powerful and at the same time, people can be hypnotized to get absorbed in entirely fictitious experiences and yet they will become very tearful and very dramatic and… and they will provide extraordinary details for things that never actually happened, but the lines blur between what's real and what's fantasy to where the persons can start to absorb themselves in, well, the… the retired professor Emeritus from Stanford University, Ernest Hilgard. And Dr. Hilgard termed hypnosis as "believed in imagination", and I thinks that’s still to date probably the most profound yet simple way of characterizing the nature of the hypnosis. 

00:20:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, most people I think they would look at the vividness of the memory and the emotional impact of the memory is criterion as… as to whether that's a valid memory or not. 

00:20:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, I think that that’s unfortunate, because what we're really saying here is that the amount of drama does not say anything about the accuracy. The amount of detail doesn’t say anything about the accuracy. And that’s really the point here is that someone can have intense emotional responses and provide massive amount of detail for events that never actually happened. 

00:20:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So what you’re saying is, if I’m a therapist somebody could come into my office and they may be complaining about problems today in… in their sexual life. Under hypnosis they may remember having been molested by a parent or a relative or… or… or some other adult, it might make perfect therapeutic sense to think that the… the current problem is related to this memory and still there might be other explanations. 

00:21:20
MICHAEL D. YAPKO There might be other explanations. Now here's where it starts to get very murky. How do I distinguish an authentic memory from a confabulation? Well you know, for my book I interviewed many, many people. I conducted a survey in actually nearly a 1000 therapists. I talked to experts of all sorts, experts in trauma, experts in disassociation, experts in memory, experts in sexual abuse, experts in hypnosis and suggestibility, and I ask this question of all of them. How do you distinguish an authentic memory from a confabulation or false memory? And this was the only question I asked that got an unanimous response and the unanimous response was without external evidence, you can’t. That’s discouraging. I told the story in the book about a fellow who reported for therapy that he was suffering all kinds of terrible symptoms associated with his experiences in Vietnam. And he described having flashbacks to when he was in fox holes and bullets whizzing past his head and bombs going off and bodies exploding and friends getting killed. He described his experience of being a prisoner of war, held captive, and you know, terrible symptoms of nightmares and uncontrollable rages. And in this particular story, he ended up killing himself and his wife of 20 years wanted his name placed on the Vietnam War Memorial, and they said, fine, but we need to research his background a little bit. And so they tried to find out then what unit he was in and when he was there and all of that. How could anybody have known this guy was never in Vietnam? Now that kind of story can happen to anybody. I mean, if somebody walked in and sit down and said to me, I was in Vietnam and here are these terrible memoires I have, I don’t have any basis for doubting or disbelieving. But we certainly in these cases of sexual abuse, we want to be able to distinguish, are these memoires that came up independently or under the influence of something like therapy or some other external source? That's… That’s the complicating factor here. 

00:23:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! And it seems from the point of view of the therapist, there are true real issues, one is the… the potential for the therapist to actually be creating the memory through a process of suggestion or perhaps even through something more subtle then overt suggestion and… and the other is, I think the therapeutic issue that even if… if it wasn’t a created, memory therapist tend to be… to cultivate empathy with their clients and… and to establish the rapport they may not want to challenge the client on… on a memory like that. 

00:24:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yes, and that concerns me too. One of the things that I asked about in the survey that I did of therapist across the country, I asked them to respond to this statement I have to believe my client if I’m going to help him or her. And the majority of the therapists said yes. And so basically the way that I interpret that or at least one interpretation is, that if I have to suspend any critical thinking in order to establish a rapport with someone, if I have to believe any story that they tell me in order to be able to help them or hurt them, I’m literally giving up my ability to think critically. And I think that it’s a… a fine line to walk of how can I put myself in the position of not having to validate you certainly not invalidating you, but being able to help you even thought I don’t really know what the truth is? I don’t know if this person was abused, I don’t know that they weren’t abused. I can’t… I can't validate it or invalidate it, but I can still certainly help the person and I think that’s an important point. 

00:25:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It… It seems that the key here in… in all of this is that the therapists and… and clients perhaps would do well to cultivate a greater tolerance for the ambiguity of the situation. 

00:25:10
MICHAEL D. YAPKO I love that phrase, "tolerating ambiguity", because the reality is most of life is ambiguous. We're just not that clear about a lot of things. And the problem is that because people don’t tolerate ambiguity well, that’s what leads them to then jump to conclusions that aren’t wanted. 

00:25:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE This is a sense of… of needing to rush to judgment, wanting to have an answer, wanting to have… 

00:25:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yes, yes! 

00:25:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …I suppose people feel that the answer will somehow ease their pain? 

00:25:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO I think so. And I think on the other side of it, you have therapists that have a very difficult time acknowledging that the answer to the question of was I abused or wasn’t I is, I don’t know, because they're the experts, they're supposed to know. 

00:25:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:25:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO And yet what I’m suggesting is that it’s real important to be able to say, I don’t know. 

00:26:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It’s probably true in many areas of life besides psychotherapy. 

00:26:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Absolutely! 

00:26:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I think this may be part of the human condition that in politics and religion, we often seek the answers prematurely. 

00:26:15
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yes! You know, my… my favorite way of describing their phenomenon is to say that life is an experiential war shock. War shocks are those inkblots that… that we are use as projective tests in psychology, but that’s what this is about. Life isn’t a inkblot, there aren’t really very many things that are clearly defined. And so one person looks at life and says, life is an adventure and somebody else looks at life and says life is really a drag. 

00:26:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, Michael Yapko, it certainly been an enlightening and very interesting half-hour with you, looking at the issue of memory and suggestibility. 

00:26:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Thanks very much for having me. 

00:26:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Thanks for being with me. And thank you for being with us.

00:27:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome, I’m Jeffery Mishlove. This is part 2 of our two-part series on memory and suggestibility. With me is Dr. Michael Yapko, a clinical psychologist from San Diego, California, who is Director of the Milton Ericson Institute in San Diego. Dr. Michael Yapko is the author of numerous books including trancework and Suggestions of Abuse, True and False Memories of Childhood Sexual Trauma. Welcome Michael. 

00:28:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Thank you Jeffrey. 

00:28:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's good to be with you again. 

00:28:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Happy to be here. 

00:28:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In part 1 of this series we talked about how memory is really more of a process of reconstruction rather than reproduction. 

00:28:15
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Right, we were talking about the fact that memory comes about through a variety of influences and that the fact that memory is not just a computer, it’s not just a video camera or a videotape that it's subject to errors arising under a variety of conditions. 

00:28:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE There are many well known errors and in fact I think you quote Mark Twain, who said the amazing thing, "Isn’t all the things I can remember, but all the things I remember that aren't true." 

00:28:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Isn't that a great quote? 

00:28:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:28:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO I really like that. 

00:28:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! But it becomes very serious when we look at it in the context of this psychotherapeutic process. 

00:28:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yes! Yeah, we’re in the midst now of… Well let me say it this way, I’ve been in this field for 20 years, I have never seen anything nearly as divisive as acrimonious as emotionally charged as this current debate that’s going on about the phenomenon of repressed memories. So, memory is front and center stage. What do we really know, what are the conditions under which false memories might be implanted, what do we really know about repression? Some of the things that I expect that we’ll get into. 

00:29:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… Let’s talk about how a false memory could actually be created in… within the content of psychotherapy. 

00:29:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Okay! 

00:29:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I think many people really would… would doubt if a complete whole false memory could be created? 

00:29:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, it depends on how you think about the process. You know, the idea of just implanting a memory in someone is as the critics contend pretty unlikely. But that isn’t how would it happens. 

00:29:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Alright, it’s not as if we have pills? 

00:29:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Right! 

00:29:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE For that purpose. 

00:29:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yeah! It… It’s a process. And to describe the way the process works, someone comes in for therapy, is in a vulnerable state, looking for answers, they are in a lot of emotional distress, they're trying to make sense out of all these symptoms that are very puzzling to them, and so now they're looking to the authority, the… the therapist as someone who knows about these things and understands about these things. And so when the therapist says, "well, all the symptoms that you’ve described to me suggest that you have been abused as a child." And then the person says, "well, I don’t have any memoires like that." The therapist says, "well, you know that’s how repression works." Well now the patient is in a double-bind, a no-win situation. If they accept the therapist diagnoses that they were abused and repressed it, then there is something wrong with them. They are an abuse survivor. If they don’t accept the therapist diagnoses, they're still something wrong with them, they're not facing what appeared to be clinical facts. 

00:30:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE They are in denial. 

00:30:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO They are in denial. And so, now what we have is this knowing scenario, where the person now first starts to form the belief that abuse is a possible explanation for their symptoms. At this point, they don’t have any particular memoires, but they now accepted the premise that abuse best explains their symptoms. And the important point is that once they have accepted their premise, once they have formed that belief, then slowly up come images that are interpreted as memories, up come ideas that are interpreted as evidence, up comet fragments of perception that are interpreted as evidence. And so the important point here is that belief precedes the memoires. It’s not like you just implant a memory in someone. 

00:31:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… I suppose what we're getting at is really one of the fundamental problems that… that scientific researchers have had with psychotherapy from the very beginning and… and that is often in the therapeutic context, we are dealing with… with premises that are unfalsifiable. 

00:31:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yes! 

00:31:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Untestable! That if it's way or if it’s that way the therapist has an answer so there's no way to get out of that system? 

00:32:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Right, and all of it is possible. And that’s the problem is, because these things sound possible. I mean, take… take the simple… Let… Let’s put aside sexual abuse as an emotionally charged issue for a moment, let’s just talk about something pretty routine like, somebody who wants to lose 25 pounds. They present the 25 pounds to their physician who says, "well, your problem is metabolic." They present it to an analyst who says, "you are fixated at the oral stage of development, let’s explore your relationship with your mother." They present it to a behavior therapist who says, "you must be getting reinforced for being overweight." They present it to a cognitive therapist who says, "the way that you're thinking about food is all wrong." They present it to a recovery therapist who says, "well, it’s just your inner child seeking nurturance." And so you… you can take that… that problem of 25 pounds overweight and you can interpret it from so many different frameworks and they all sound reasonably satisfying. 

00:32:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And an abuse therapist might say, "well, you were abused in the past so you are putting on weight so that you’ll sexually unattractive and won’t have to confront." 

00:33:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Exactly, your right! And… And that’s sounds good, that sounds reasonably possible. 

00:33:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:33:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO But possible isn’t necessarily true and that’s been the age old problem with psychotherapy and… and I can’t blame therapist for that and I hope it doesn’t sound that way, because the reality is a client represents a roar(ph) shocking plot. Somebody comes in and says depression and now it’s the therapist who has to figure out why is this person depressed and what do I need to do about it. And so if they have a more biological viewpoint about things they don’t interpret it as being a deficiency of neurotransmitters and if they have a more social viewpoint, they'll say it’s because your family relationships were disturbed. And so, we’re in the unfortunate position of trying to make sense out of things that don’t really have a lot of sensibility to them. 

00:33:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I… I think a key point here is that psychotherapy itself is probably more of an art than a science. 

00:33:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO That is true. 

00:33:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE As much as therapists try to be scientific and to take into account scientific researcher almost unanimously from the scientific community comes the criticism that… that therapists are not adopting points of view that are in principle falsifiable through scientific methods. 

00:34:15
MICHAEL D. YAPKO That’s right! And you see the problem is the therapy setting itself that makes it very difficult for therapists to do that and… and… and I can appreciate that as a… as a clinician myself. You’re relying on my judgment. You're relying on my experience, and because it is mostly art as you say, there is a tremendous variability in the quality of therapists, in… in the quality of the results that they're able to produce. And that’s why in many ways it's let the consumer be aware and be a very intelligent shopper about who you’re seeing and how this person interacts with you. 

00:34:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So the first step in any case is that the therapist is likely to… to… based on their own theoretical orientation is likely to say your symptoms seem to be like those of a person who has been abused. 

00:35:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Right, and once they offer that suggestion, it's… and… and… and when we look at all these suggestive influences of how someone can slowly be led to believe things happen to and then in fact never actually happened, here's the number one way, it's misinformation that's presented by a creditable authority. The reality is, we don’t have a reliable system for determining who has been abused and who hasn’t. Despite the fact that I even quoted some therapist in my book who said, "oh yeah, I can spot a abuse survivor just from the way they sit." And they believed that. "Well, I can spot a abuse survivor just from the way they dress or the way they hold their body." And that is when to me it has reached a point of absurdity, but it's misinformation presented by a creditable authority and it’s the person's well-being that's basically held hostage. You know, in… in the world of religion it's believe and you will be saved. In the world of mental health it's believe and you'll be healed. And so you literally see a tremendous amount of literature out there that says literally, remembering is the key to healing. So whatever your problems are, there is a very intense motivation to recover these presumably repressed memories as the path to wellness. 

00:36:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And… And I suppose also in the… in the… in the context of therapy, it's usually done in a… in a small room with just two people present… 

00:36:20
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Right! 

00:36:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …the therapist and the client. It’s… It's not as if, especially in the private context, there is much accountability and the therapist can… can develop a perhaps a sense of complicacy or a sense of arrogance about their abilities where… where they not really looking over their own shoulder to… to double-check, to… to look at alternative views. 

00:36:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yeah! I… I think that’s true and also to be fair though, what I've found in serving so many therapists for my book is that their intentions are benevolent. They… They genuinely believe that they are accurately diagnosing and accurately treating. And when you go to the therapy conventions there are book displays gore and dozens of titles that deal with the issues of abuse and so they pick up the journals and they're reading current research and that’s suggests that to them that what they're doing is correct. And they listen to charismatic speakers who are… who are acknowledged as being gifted therapists. And the therap… the… the speakers are telling them here's what's right. And so they… they… they come to believe that they are doing good work and so they… they start to form the idea that, once… once they accept the premise that sexual abuse underlies all of these symptoms then it becomes a matter of how do I convey that to my patient and help them understand what I understand so that they can get better. And despite the fact that this has resulted in many lawsuits and many instances of obvious malpractice, what's beneath it though is in fact a good intention. 

00:37:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I would imagine that therapists are reluctant to consider or… or believe or imagine themselves that they could actually implant a false memory. 

00:38:10
MICHAEL D. YAPKO That to me is one of the most dangerous observations of all. The fact that we have therapists who are largely uniformed about the workings of memory, who don’t understand the suggestions of their own treatment modalities, and so when I surveyed therapists and asked basic questions, do you know that memory is suggestible, do you know that you can implant false memories, do you know that you can lead people to believe things that aren’t true that end up influencing the course of the treatment? I was startled to say the least that how frequently therapists believe things that represent misinformation at least sheer myth at most. 

00:38:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, of course, therapists are human beings also. 

00:38:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yes, and yet at the same time, because we're entrusting people's care to them we would hope that they are better informed about some of the most basic aspects of their own work. I think it's unfortunate that someone can go through years of clinical training and never take a course in memory, when there're patients are coming in all the time and saying, "here's what happened to me, here are my memories." 

00:39:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's certainly not generally on the required course list? 

00:39:15
MICHAEL D. YAPKO It isn’t and it’s not… in most cases not even offered as an option. I think it’s unfortunate that most therapists are not trained in hypnosis to understand the suggestive nature of their own approaches so that they start to think that what works in therapy is some technique and they don’t realize the context in which the… the very suggestions that they're giving to people, verbally and nonverbally, directly and indirectly, have a very profound impact on the course of treatment. But to find out that therapists don’t know that much about memory and don’t know that much about suggestion, I think is a legitimate basis for concern. 

00:39:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well let’s talk further though about the actual process. I… I'd like to understand how if… if I were in there now and it’s been suggested to me that I might have this diagnoses, how is that gonna create a memory? 

00:40:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, you have to appreciate that you, as my patient, are very motivated to try and understand what's going on. And so, I give you this explanation and I’m satisfied with it as the authority, I’m telling you this as… as an authority, as someone who has an expertise in human behavior, as someone who has experience in treating, and so I’m telling you, you fit the criteria. Now, automatically that places you in doubt. "Could what he’s saying be true? Gee, I don’t have any memoires like that, but he says that that’s how repression works and so maybe I am repressing these things." And doubt, uncertainty is ultimately leads to conviction. 

00:40:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:40:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO That… That the… It's the uncertainty that precedes certainty, it’s the confusion that precedes clarity. Its… 

00:40:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But why would doubt lead to conviction? 

00:41:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO See once I have created doubts in you about your own history, about your own background, as if I know something about you that you don’t know, and I give you very compelling reasons, and literally even say to you, well the evidence that this happened to you is how much you don’t remember it, it again creates a double-bind, and so here you are in a position of wanting to understand, wanting to believe, and here I am giving you the mechanisms for believing, and I’m giving you the… the… the ideas of what to believe that will help you put this in perceptive. And I’m holding out as reinforcement, I’m literally saying to you that, if you believe this, if you come to terms with this, you will get well. And when you’re really motivated to get well, you start to believe. And so little by little, you will… this… this is the phase where people will say, well now I know I was abused, but I don’t have any memories. 

00:41:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right! 

00:41:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Now come the memory recovery techniques. Now we start to do hypnosis. Now I start to encourage you to remember. Well, you know, you mentioned that you remember that your father was giving you a bath, so your father was giving you a bath. Where was your father washing you? Where was your father touching you? Was it a touch or was it a fondle? And now again, I’m creating uncertainty, well, gee I've never thought of it as a fondle before but maybe it was a fondle. And little by little I can take these experiences that you’ve have… have little bits and pieces of and I can weave together a… a… a tapestry that strongly suggests abuse occurred and… and lead from being very uncertain to being very certain. And it’s… it's what… what another psychiatrist, Herbert Spiegel called the Honest Liar Syndrome and I think that’s a valuable perspective. He did a very interesting demonstration in… in hypnosis in which he convinced someone that he stumbled on to a communist plot to takeover radio and television stations. It's totally suggested under hypnosis. 

00:42:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The… The person who was hypnotized was convinced that they themselves had uncovered a communist plot. 

00:43:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Right, right! Something totally alien to their belief system prior to undergoing hypnosis, but it… it just demonstrated in a very quick and effective way, how you can immerse someone in a belief system that leads them to recover memories consistent with the belief and that’s my point about beliefs preceding memories. So now that I have you believing that you were abused, and now we start using these memory recover techniques like hypnosis, guided imagery, visualization, projected drawings, dream analysis, body symptom analysis, I’m… I'm continually giving you more and more evidence coming out of your own unconscious that this happened, that it's real. 

00:43:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Now, you should say that it’s… it's my understanding that therapists who are properly trained in interview techniques and hypnotic techniques are very careful not to make suggestions of this sort? 

00:43:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, that isn’t what was born out in my research. I… I wish it were the case, but what I’ve been finding out is that surprising a large number of therapists don’t realize that they're asking leading questions, don’t recognize that they are using suggestive techniques. Even people who have been trained in hypnosis did not know that hypnosis can be used to create false memories. They literally believed that once someone was in hypnosis that hypnosis basically acted as a lie detector and that any memories that came up in hypnosis must be authentic memoires. Now that’s startling in the face of having gone through formal training in hypnosis, because those represent sheer myths. Hypnosis is not a lie detector. Can someone lie in hypnosis? Yeah, absolutely! Can someone create memories or events and come to believe that they really happened in hypnosis? Yeah, absolutely! Hypnosis is no lie detector. I wish that there was a way to readily distinguish true memories from false memories. But this is a technology that does not yet exist and since we can’t tell true memoires from false memoires, especially those that arise during these kinds of hypnosis sessions or suggestive sessions, I… I wanna make the point of saying that it doesn’t have to be hypnosis, it can… it can simply be close your eyes and start to imagine. Now, lot of people would say, well that’s not hypnosis and yet it’s very hypnotic and so I make a distinction between formal hypnosis and informal hypnosis. But what surprised me was that many people didn’t realize that hypnosis wasn’t a lie detector. They thought you could hypnosis to uncover the truth and in fact that's how I got into this whole thing, because of my expertise with hypnosis, therapists would routinely call me and ask me, "would you hypnotize my patient and find out if she was abused." And that concerned me, because that represents the myth that you can use hypnosis as the uncover of the truth. And that’s why I added a section in my textbook on hypnosis about the fact that hypnosis isn’t a lie detector and that you could in fact use hypnosis to create false memories. 

00:46:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:46:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO That’s when I got literally hundreds of calls from all over about exactly these kinds of false memory situations. 

00:46:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Of course there are some instances in which hypnosis can uncover the truth. 

00:46:15
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yeah, absolutely! 

00:46:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And so it… 

00:46:20
MICHAEL D. YAPKO That’s the complicating factor. 

00:46:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It requires external corroboration. 

00:46:20
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Correct! I can use hypnosis to recover accurate memories that have been repressed and I can use hypnosis to create confabulations. And I can’t tell the difference between them without external evidence. 

00:46:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, now let’s take a hypothetical case. Let’s suppose somebody in your office has come in and say they've got depression. They don’t know… have any idea that they're sexually abused. 

00:46:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Right! 

00:46:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And in the course of your giving them hypnotic treatment for depression, which I know you’ve written a few books on, memory spontaneously comes up without any suggestions on… on your part or any expectation on your part of… of a childhood sexual abuse. 

00:47:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, the first thing that I would have to do is literally go back and review the tape of my interaction with this person. You know, it’s… it's funny how sensitized as I am to the suggestive questioning, can I throw out a suggestive or a leading question without me myself releasing and the answer is sure. So, the first thing I would want and do is go back. I tape record literally every session I do. 

00:47:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes! 

00:47:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO So the first thing I would do is go back and… and review the tape. Did I in fact ask anything that was leading or suggestive? If I come to the conclusion that no my questioning was contaminant free, that this was in fact an independent memory that came up, no external evidence, there's no basis for discounting it. 

00:47:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay! 

00:47:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Now, that doesn’t mean it’s true and it doesn’t mean it’s untrue. It may be true, but now I have to respond to it as if it is in fact true. That… That this person came up with memories that were free of course with influence by me free, free of contamination by me, there was no use of suggestive questioning, there was no pressure placed on this person to develop that as the explanation for their symptoms. I now, I'm going to have to deal with the fact that repressed memories do surface in and out of therapy that are in fact accurate. A repressed memory can be an often is an accurate memory. 

00:48:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And now, let’s suppose that your client says to you, "shall I discuss this with my family?" 

00:48:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, first of all, long before they take that step I’m going to want to explore a lot about that memory and what it means and what its significance is. You see the context in which a memory comes up does matter. You know, if somebody says, "well, here's something that happened to me when I was three months old and I have clear memory of it", there is some legitimate basis for questioning it. On the other hand if this person says, "when I was 9 years old or 12 years old this happened to me and I remember it and now it’s coming back to me and I know this happened." I’m now going to have to treat this like a bona fide memory of… of… that has been repressed of… of a survivor's experiences. But long before I would encourage confronting the family, if ever, that’s not a necessary step. And in fact some people chose not to confront their families and I think it’s a valid choice. Part of my criticism is when somebody follows a recovery formula that you have to confront your family, you have to cut yourself off from all those people who don’t immediately believe you, you have to do A, B, C, D, E, I think each person’s recovery is a very individual process. So long before they chose to confront their family, I'm gonna talk with them a lot about why do you wanna do this, what do you expect to happen, what happens if you get the response you don’t want? Let’s… Let's consider the whole spectrum of possible responses that you might get. How is this gonna aid you, how might it retard you in your recovery? And the point is if someone going to make that choice, and it’s their choice to make it’s not my formula, my job is make sure that they understand the implications of those choices and that they choice wisely. 

00:50:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Now, let me ask kind of an inverse question. Let’s suppose you have in your office a parent. Let’s… Let's suppose in fact that your client confronted their… their father, female client confronted the father, the father is now in your office and says, "I didn’t do it." 

00:50:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, I am operating in a position of utter ignorance and I confess it openly. I don’t know if he did, I don’t know if he didn’t do it. You know, that's… that’s what's so upsetting about these situations is her memoires are detailed, vivid, emotional, the last thing I want to do is discount her. His denial is vehement, it’s powerful, it's believable, it's creditable. He’s emotional, he’s tearful. I don’t know who's telling the truth and who isn’t telling the truth and yet we have two virtually opposite narratives of… of life experience. So, I can’t know and I don’t know. I don’t have a technology for determining whose telling the truth and who isn’t. She can take a lie detector, test and pass it. He can take a lie detector test and pass it. All the lie detector does is measures what somebody believes not what's really true. So if he's convinced himself he’s innocent and would never do such a thing even if he did, he’ll pass a lie detector. 

00:51:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes! 

00:51:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO So, I don’t have a way of knowing. All I can say is, "look your denials are very convincing, her accusations are very convincing. I don’t know what's true." Now the question is how are we gonna find a way to… to let this relationship continue in some modified form if continuing it as a goal as you say it is or as she says it is, but if she's waiting to hear an affirmation or a confession, he’s not gonna give it. 

00:51:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:51:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO If… If he’s waiting for her to drop the accusation, she is not going to. 

00:51:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And let’s suppose he is now your client. Let’s say he’s seeing you privately now and he says, "my daughter has said, what am I gonna do?" How would you… How would you… 

00:52:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO My first question is what does he want? Does he want her to drop the accusation? Does he does he want the relationship to continue without him ever having to offer a confession? What… What does he want? And so, you know, my… my personal goal as best as possible is keep the relationships going, keep communication going, that even though right now she’s adamant in her position, he’s adamant in his, I’m hoping that eventually there will be some middle ground where they can meet and so I certainly want to at least encourage him to do as much as he can to keep the relationship going, continue to send birthday cards. It’s okay right now she doesn't wanna see you, right now she doesn’t wanna talk to you, see if you can get into the therapy thoughts first. 

00:52:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Would you encourage have him to… to have hypnosis to see if he's repressed of memory? 

00:52:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Again, hypnosis is not a lie detector. 

00:52:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:52:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO You know, I… you take one of the most celebrated cases in the country, the subject of a book by Lawrence Wright called Remembering Satan. Paul Ingram confessed on the basis of false memories of being a perpetrator. Now, he… You know, most of the things that I described were cases of people falsely having memoires of having been abused, he has false memories of having been an abuser. So it… it works in all configurations and the problem is we don’t have truth, we only have people's beliefs. 

00:53:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! So, you wouldn't recommend that parents subject themselves to hypnosis. 

00:53:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO No! Hypnosis is not a lie detector. What I really wanna see happen is the therapists take themselves out of the role of being a patient's hitman and do the best that they can instead of cutting off communication, that they keep communication between family members going. 

00:53:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Keep communication open. Well, Michael Yapko, we’re out of time. It’s been a very informative half-hour with you. 

00:53:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO It’s been nice talking with you, thanks for having me here. 

00:53:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Thanks for being with me Michael, and thank you for being with us.
