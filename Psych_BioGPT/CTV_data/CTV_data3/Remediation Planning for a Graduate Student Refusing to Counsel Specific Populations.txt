AMERICAN COUNSELING ASSOCIATION ALEXANDER STREET PRESS Counselor Education & Supervision Academy Remediation Planning for A Graduate Student Refusing to Counsel Specific Populations 

00:00:00
Perry C. Francis 

00:00:00
PERRY C. FRANCIS Good afternoon. My name is Perry Francis. I'm a professor of counseling at Eastern Michigan University, and we are here to do a demonstration session on working with students with a remediation plan as they have a values conflict. Let me have my partner introduce himself. 

00:00:20
Shannon Hodges 

00:00:20
SHANNON HODGES I'm Shannon Hodges, and I am associate professor of counseling at Niagara University. 

00:00:25
PERRY C. FRANCIS Now, one of the things I want to make absolutely clear to everybody is that he is role-playing today. And, and there's a reason for that. Go ahead and tell them why. 

00:00:35
SHANNON HODGES Yeah, I, uh, a few years ago during role-play, where I was playing kind of, how do I say this, basically I was an obnoxious client. And there were several people very angry with me, and I was trying to get across to them that I'm playing a role. So either I must've been either a, just naturally obnoxious or b, I seemed that way. So again, I'm going to play a role. And this role is not who I am, and it would press the ceiling of my, in fact it would burst through the ceiling of my own value system. But part of it to bring realistic, because we all are going to encounter people who is going to be like this person I'm playing. And, to be realistic, I need to, uh, get into that character. And it's a character I know very very well, probably we all do to some extent. So, I'll be doing that. 

00:01:30
PERRY C. FRANCIS What we're going to do is role-play this. Shannon is going to be a student who is in practicum. And he's been identified as saying basically, you know, this isn't a population I'm working with. Now, he's got to there. We've done our best during the, uh, education process. We are heading towards clinical work, and it now it's really manifested itself. And I am the advisor who's in charge of working with him and remediating with him. So, this is where we're going to try to work this, and it's kind of a two-stage process. We're going to first talk about it as an advisor, as a faculty member to a student. And hopefully, we can get to a point where we can begin talking about a remediation claim. And that's very important because in, in, trust me, it's not as quick as it happens, as it's going to happen here. As you often times see when you look in your side view mirror, things are closer than they appear. Okay, this is going to happen a little faster than it really does in real life. So I want to make sure everybody understands that. Okay? Are you ready to begin? 

00:02:35
SHANNON HODGES I'm ready. 

00:02:35
PERRY C. FRANCIS Hi, Shannon. 

00:02:40
SHANNON HODGES Hi, Dr. Francis. 

00:02:40
PERRY C. FRANCIS Good to have you here. Hey, have a seat. 

00:02:45
SHANNON HODGES Sure. 

00:02:45
PERRY C. FRANCIS Uh, you know, do you understand why you've been asked to see me? 

00:02:50
SHANNON HODGES No, not really. I think my grades of that pretty good. I seem to get along with most folks. You know, I'm, you know, practicum is going well. Some struggles, but my class mates are having struggles. 

00:03:05
PERRY C. FRANCIS Okay, so tell me about the struggles. 

00:03:05
SHANNON HODGES Uh, well, I mean, you know it's different than the classroom. You know, suddenly you've got somebody there who's got a real issue. It's not like reading the textbook, you know. And, uh, you know, sometime, you meet people you don't agree with. You've all told us about this. Okay, I get that. I got that as well as I could in the classroom. But I meet people with different political opinion from me and a different educational opinions, you know, different social opinions of such. And part of it is just I'm working to understand that that's them, and this is me. It's a struggle sometimes to do that. I'll admit, you know. 

00:03:45
PERRY C. FRANCIS Yeah, and, and I'm glad to hear you say that, uh, because your practicum supervisor asked me to meet with you. 

00:03:50
SHANNON HODGES Oh. 

00:03:55
Perry C. Francis 

00:03:55
PERRY C. FRANCIS He has expressed a concern, and he said he's expressed it with you during supervision. And, part of our process is if there is a concern, it's shared with the faculty advisor, and the faculty advisor will sit down with the student in question, normally with the, with the faculty member who has a concern. Unfortunately, Dr. Smith is unavailable. So I said I'd go ahead and meet with you without Dr. Smith available and talk a bit about, uh, your approach to people who are different than you, specifically people who are gay. 

00:04:25
PERRY C. FRANCIS Okay. 

00:04:25
SHANNON HODGES Tell me a little bit about your experience in practicum, because I know that you've had a, a client who is gay. 

00:04:30
Shannon Hodges 

00:04:30
PERRY C. FRANCIS Yeah. Well, you know, one of the things that, that I'm trying to do, you know, is I'm looking at the ethics, and I'm trying to do what's in the best interest of the client. 

00:04:45
PERRY C. FRANCIS Sure. 

00:04:45
SHANNON HODGES You know, like, I had this client who is gay, and, uh, part of what he is wanting to talk about is his relationship and these other kinds. And this is a real value conflict for me because, you know, in my religion's, uh, community, being gay is a sin. 

00:05:05
PERRY C. FRANCIS It's a sin. 

00:05:05
SHANNON HODGES Yeah, it's very clear in the Bible in the book of Leviticus, it talks about, you know, that it's an abomination for a man to lie with a man. We take that very seriously, and to, I mean, for this person to get the best help he, he, I mean that he needs to get, I don't think I can give that to him. You know, I don't think I have that ability because if I were going to be real honest, I would say to him, "Well, you need to change. You need to be, you need to walk in the light, you know. You need to walk in the light and get out of the darkness." 

00:05:40
PERRY C. FRANCIS So, let me stop, stop you hear and see if I understand. One of the things that, that you're really struggling with is that you're, you're working with somebody whose value system and behavior is so different from yours that you are, you're unable to work with him. 

00:05:55
SHANNON HODGES Aren't you a minister? 

00:06:00
PERRY C. FRANCIS I used to be yes, I did. But, that's not the issue here. 

00:06:05
SHANNON HODGES I'm sorry. What is the issue? 

00:06:05
PERRY C. FRANCIS The issue here is, I'm glad you asked. The issue here is how can I, how can I as a counselor work with a diverse client population, work with people who are different for me. 

00:06:15
SHANNON HODGES Well, I'm doing that. I mean, I work with people. Most of the people I work with are women. I've work with people of color. I've worked with people who have a different socioeconomic status, some better, some worse than me. People I've met, people from other parts of the country and overseas. I'm working with a very diverse population. 

00:06:35
PERRY C. FRANCIS And you are. And, and I applaud you for that, and I support you in that. Yet, in this area you seem to be really coming across as that this is wrong, and you're wrong, and I'm right. 

00:06:50
SHANNON HODGES Look. I, I met a spirit filled Christian. 

00:06:55
PERRY C. FRANCIS Sure. 

00:06:55
SHANNON HODGES And, my understanding and what is taught in our community is this is a moral issue. And, I feel very strongly about that. I think I'm being very fair, because if I counsel this person he's not going to get what he needs. Because what I think what he needs is, is not where he's at. 

00:07:20
PERRY C. FRANCIS So, one of your biggest concerns is that you have already decided what he needs. 

00:07:20
PERRY C. FRANCIS In, in, in one case, yes, you know. What he needs to do is, what he needs to do is, you know, there are people out there, and I've read about them. They stop being gay or lesbian and they become straight. You know, and they talk about how happy they are. 

00:07:35
Perry C. Francis 

00:07:35
PERRY C. FRANCIS And I want to address that in just a little bit, uh, but first I want to address this particular piece. Because one of the things, and I've had you in class before. I know you to be a very kind of guy, is the difference between going in and building a relationship with a client that is nonjudgmental, that comes in and accepts the person for where they're at in the world, and going in and hearing about what a client's life is like and immediately labeling the client and in essence inserting your own values into the session. Let me give you an example if I can. Think about this client for moment. If the, what's the client's issue? 

00:08:30
SHANNON HODGES The client is having relationship issues with his partner, and they are not sure they're going to be able, that they're compatible and whatnot. In a nutshell, that's it. 

00:08:40
PERRY C. FRANCIS Okay. So, if the demographics of the clients were different, would you be able to help him? 

00:08:45
SHANNON HODGES Yeah, I think I would be able to try, yeah. I would be able to try. 

00:08:50
PERRY C. FRANCIS So, one of the first things we want to address is you have the competence to deal with a relationship issue. Under supervision, you have the competence at this point in time to deal with a relationship issue. 

00:09:10
Shannon Hodges 

00:09:10
SHANNON HODGES Well, yeah, I mean, I do. I mean, I've had relationship issues are not unusual in counseling. Of course, you know that, but I don't think I have the competence to deal with this issue because, I don't get it. How can I help somebody when I don't agree with who they are, and, and, and their practices. I don't agree with sex offenders either. They are different from me. You know? 

00:09:35
PERRY C. FRANCIS And I hear that, and I, and I wonder though if that's not your values coming through. And, and, and let me see if I can, if I can help you with this. When we go into a session with a client, we adopt those values of the profession. What do you think some of those values are? 

00:10:00
SHANNON HODGES Well, I, I think the values are to, as I understand them, to try to do what's in the best interest of the client, you know, to try and as best you can put your, you know, understand the client's values and not yours. I get that on most levels. Uh, I understand, you know, that being a self reflective practitioner is getting supervision, you know, and consultation etc, ongoing training. So part of that is it's a growth oriented profession. But here's what I don't get, it seems to me this profession is very good on sticking up for other people's values but mine. But me and, and the small group of people in this program who are religious Christians, because they're Christians in this program that are not like us. I know that. Like yourself maybe. I don't get why my values keep getting stepped on. I don't get why the gay agenda keeps getting shoved down my throat. I don't get why nobody seems to care about the values. I don't get why nobody seems to care about people like me. 

00:11:00
Perry C. Francis 

00:11:00
PERRY C. FRANCIS So, let me, let me stop you there for a moment, because I want to make sure that you, that you hear this because this is important. We are not asking you to abandon your values. 

00:11:10
SHANNON HODGES No? 

00:11:10
PERRY C. FRANCIS No. I want to be very clear with you about that. There's a difference between having you abandon your values, and having you be you. But the other piece is that when you work, work as a professional counselor, you adopt the values of the profession. And when you go to work with the client, you bracket off your values, and you put them aside. Not change them. Not give them up. Put them aside, because what you're doing is entering the world of the client. And when you enter the world of the client, you're not adopted their values. You're not taking them on is your own. You're going forward with the values of the profession in a non-judgmental fashion to work with a diverse client population and enter their world. To seek to understand where they are coming from. 

00:12:05
Shannon Hodges 

00:12:05
SHANNON HODGES That sounds good, you know, but I still feel like, I still feel like my values are being trampled on. You know, I mean, my grades have been good in this program. And, and you know, most of the feedback I've gotten from my field site supervisors has been good. You know, I know that I was aware of this issue, and I figured that's why you wanted to talk to me. But, again, I mean... 

00:12:40
PERRY C. FRANCIS You are hearing me say that we are not asking you to change your values. 

00:12:40
SHANNON HODGES I'm confused by that. I'm confused by that. I mean, it seems like you want me to change my values, but you're saying I don't have to change my values. What do you mean? 

00:12:55
PERRY C. FRANCIS Okay, let's talk about the difference. When, when you work as a professional counselor, you come into the profession and you take a look at the ethics. The ethics will talk to us about what are the values of the profession. One of them is, well, we don't judge our clients. We go forward to work with a diverse client population, and we seek to build a good therapeutic relationship. It doesn't say you have to give up your self at the door. It says your values are set aside. In other words, I suspend my values so that I don't push them on my client in fear of pushing my values on that person. And you know, in essence, and you said it earlier. They are walking in the dark. I need to, I need to let them know that that's wrong. How would you, how do you feel when someone tells you you're wrong, and they're trying to help you? 

00:13:50
SHANNON HODGES It seems like I get that a lot. I mean, this is a very liberal class, institutions etc. I feel like I'm constantly being told I'm wrong. I've got the wrong religion. I've got the wrong politics. I'm the wrong gender. I'm the wrong sexual orientation. You know, you name it. I, it seems like I am, everywhere I turn I'm being told that I've got, there's some reason for me to be ashamed of myself. And, when is someone, when is, when is the values of this institutionalist program going to say to somebody like me, "We care about you too. We care about your rights. We care about who you are as a person. We affirm you in the diversity that you bring to the table." I don't feel that. You know, I feel like that I'm constantly being attacked. And if I'm honest, at times whether it's in, you know, on practicum, during meetings or in class, I feel like I get attacked by people. 

00:14:45
PERRY C. FRANCIS Well, let me back that up a little bit. You said that your grades are good. The feedback on your skills have been? 

00:14:50
SHANNON HODGES For the most part, yeah. 

00:14:55
PERRY C. FRANCIS You've been strong. 

00:14:55
SHANNON HODGES For the most part, yeah. 

00:14:55
Perry C. Francis 

00:14:55
PERRY C. FRANCIS And so, part of what I'm hearing is being challenged to open your viewpoint to other populations feels like to you an attack on you. 

00:15:05
SHANNON HODGES Because I don't feel that other people are willing to hear about my values and my world. 

00:15:15
PERRY C. FRANCIS Okay, and, and I want you to know that we are interested in your world. And that we don't want you to change your values. I want to be very clear with you about that. 

00:15:25
Shannon Hodges 

00:15:25
SHANNON HODGES I keep, I hear you, I hear you saying that, Dr. Francis. I, I appreciate that. I do, okay. That's the first time anybody has said anything like that to me, because my experience in the classroom, I know what to say and when to be quiet to keep myself out of trouble. Because if I talk very honestly, I get attacked. I get attacked by my fellow students and sometimes by faculty, you know, for my more conservative views. I, I noticed liberal students in my classes, they can stand up and say pretty much whatever they want, and people are frigging clapping for them. Well, if I stand up and do that, I'm going to get stoned. You know? So, I, I appreciate you saying I don't have to change my values. You seem to be the only one who's telling me that. 

00:16:10
PERRY C. FRANCIS Well, so let's take it another step, just a little bit further down. Because I know that if we have a student who was on the other end and telling people, you know, from whatever viewpoint that they had something that sounded judgmental about say for example, a conservative religious client, the same thing would hold. 

00:16:35
SHANNON HODGES You, you know they say that, right? You know the other students make fun of people like me, and occasionally they get the client and they say things. You, you get that, right? 

00:16:40
PERRY C. FRANCIS Yeah, and the same thing holds true for them. 

00:16:45
SHANNON HODGES So, you're going to talk, I'm sorry to interrupt you, I don't mean to be rude. And I do respect you. But, you talk to people, you talk to the other students, the one to make fun of people like me? 

00:16:55
PERRY C. FRANCIS Well, let's take a look at that piece from a larger point of view. What is the point of our training? 

00:17:00
SHANNON HODGES To be helpful. 

00:17:00
PERRY C. FRANCIS To be helpful. Help to all people. To be helpful to all people, a diverse client population. And this isn't a battle against you or a battle against them. This is about our trying to help you focus on what is necessary to know to help a diverse client population, to be able to, and I'll use that term again, bracket those values off, hold them in suspension as it were, so that when you enter into a relationship with the client, you do so with an open mind about who they are as a person. Not, not judging them. 

00:17:40
SHANNON HODGES May ask your question, Dr. Francis? 

00:17:45
PERRY C. FRANCIS Sure. 

00:17:45
SHANNON HODGES Uh, one of our classmates is staunchly pro-life. I am too. Are you telling me that it's realistic for her to sit down and do a counseling session for someone who wants to talk and explore the possibilities of getting an abortion? 

00:18:05
PERRY C. FRANCIS Let's take a look at that, okay, from your point of view. How can I enter the client's world and help her with her struggle? 

00:18:15
SHANNON HODGES Well... 

00:18:15
PERRY C. FRANCIS Can you, can you help somebody with their struggle? 

00:18:20
SHANNON HODGES Yeah, I think I can. 

00:18:20
Perry C. Francis 

00:18:20
PERRY C. FRANCIS Okay. So, it's not the issue as much as it is the struggle to help the client within their worldview work with their struggle. Now, let's say, let's turn it around another way. Let's say if it were a conservative Christian client who was struggling with some issue of a challenge to their faith, and I were an atheist. Would it be fair for me to say, "Well, you just needed to give that up." 

00:18:55
Shannon Hodges 

00:18:55
SHANNON HODGES Well, you know something? I've been canceling before, and I've heard counselors say things like that to me. 

00:19:00
PERRY C. FRANCIS And how does it feel? 

00:19:05
SHANNON HODGES Terrible. It felt like I was judged and devalued and demeaned and a whole bunch of other things. 

00:19:10
PERRY C. FRANCIS And now you've just identified why we suspend those beliefs, not give them up, suspend them, put them aside so that we can enter the world and not do that. 

00:19:20
SHANNON HODGES But it seems like were suspending conservative beliefs. It seems like liberal beliefs and liberal values are just fine. We can have abortion. We can be atheists. You know, we can be anti-, be anti-wars in the Middle East. We can be... 

00:19:35
PERRY C. FRANCIS We can be all these things. 

00:19:35
SHANNON HODGES But it just seems like I'm the one, it seems to me like I'm the one who's constantly having to make the sacrifice. I'd like to see some of my liberal fellow students make some of these sacrifices. 

00:19:50
PERRY C. FRANCIS And I'm hoping that, you know, that the message does get out, but I can't, I can't deal with that now. I have to deal with who I have here in front of me. And I do hear that part about you that is, "Hey, this isn't just about me. This is how we approach counseling." And that's the part I want you to hear. 

00:20:10
SHANNON HODGES Do, but... 

00:20:10
PERRY C. FRANCIS And, let's, let's, let's go a little bit farther. In opening you up, how do you understand other people, because you so much want to be understood. How does that play out when you're trying to understand other people? 

00:20:25
SHANNON HODGES I try and understand people that are different than me. I do that every day. I sit down and do role plays and talk with people who have very different, who were very different from me politically, socially, in socioeconomic standing. I grew up very poor. I, it seems like I'm one of the few men in the program, you know. It just seems like, uh, I was in the military. It seems like I'm constantly trying to empathize with somebody and value them, who often doesn't give that back to me. I'll admit. You, I'll admit you're doing a really nice job here trying, in talking with me. I appreciate that. Nobody else seems to want to have this kind of a dialogue with me. It's, you know, that kind of the thing. And, it's hard for me because I feel so judged. You know, it's like I feel like one more time I'm being judged, whereas you know, other people. I hear my fellow students that make horribly derogatory comments about other Republicans like myself. And, and I look, and I see all the faculty who, you know, when Obama came through, everybody went. There were all these placards and everything. I put some up, you know, for Romney and they were torn down. 

00:21:35
PERRY C. FRANCIS And how does that feel for you? 

00:21:40
SHANNON HODGES It felt terrible. 

00:21:40
PERRY C. FRANCIS Now, again, let's take that to the next step. How would that feel for the client? 

00:21:45
SHANNON HODGES What, what, you, which client? The one... 

00:21:50
PERRY C. FRANCIS Either one, whatever client. If they hold a different value system from you, how would that feel for the client to note that their counselor shared that? Now I want to walk you down. Just keep that in mind, because I'm going to walk you down. How quickly do you think clients begin to share what's really going on for them? 

00:22:05
SHANNON HODGES I, I think what I get is you have to show that you care first, and you have to show that they can trust you. Because I don't think they're going to if you don't, if you can't create that kind of alliance. 

00:22:20
Perry C. Francis 

00:22:20
PERRY C. FRANCIS So, you've got to create the alliance. Okay, so let's say you create the alliance, and the client begins to trust you and begins to share with you some of their really deep things that are going on for them. And it trips something in you. It sounds like you're very, you, you, you're trying your best to be self aware. And that trips something in you. What do you think might be the best way to handle that? 

00:22:45
Shannon Hodges 

00:22:45
SHANNON HODGES Well, I think as I understand it, that's where good supervision and consultation come in, you know, and I, I try to go to my supervisor when I get tripped up as much as I can, because I am, I am very, I am very concerned about becoming a good counselor, as good counselor as I can be. 

00:23:05
PERRY C. FRANCIS Okay, so let me identify something here, because I really want to build on this. This is really good. You want to do consultation and supervision. So one of the things is you want to go check out with your supervisor what's going on for me. 

00:23:20
SHANNON HODGES Yeah. 

00:23:20
PERRY C. FRANCIS So, in essence, bracketing off your value system. Holding it in suspension so you can go talk to a supervisor to see how this might be impacting your ability to work with the client. 

00:23:30
SHANNON HODGES Well, I did. I mean, this is what started the whole ball rolling. I went to talk to my supervisor, and, and laid out my concerns, you know, about counseling somebody who I believe is wrong. And, and I, and he does. He needs to get, I feel like, I felt like I was being ethical. It's in his best interest to counsel with somebody who can be there and, and empathize for him in a way. I don't agree with, with his lifestyle or his values. 

00:24:00
PERRY C. FRANCIS Now... 

00:24:00
SHANNON HODGES I understand what you're going to say. Bracket it off. But, it's really hard to do that at times, just like it's hard for some of my other classmates. 

00:24:05
PERRY C. FRANCIS Okay, so, you got that part about bracketing off, about supervision and consultation. What about education? 

00:24:15
SHANNON HODGES What, what do you mean? I feel like I, I, I take it seriously. I work hard to, I actually read the lesson plan, and, and prepare. I ask questions. I participate. 

00:24:25
PERRY C. FRANCIS So, let's say you're gone from here. You're, you're meeting with the client who's got an issue that is a little bit beyond your knowledge base, but you're willing to work with them and you're willing to get supervision. Would you be willing to do more education? 

00:24:35
SHANNON HODGES Oh, well sure. I have to because that happens all the time, you know. 

00:24:40
PERRY C. FRANCIS Right. So, supervision, consultation and education to help you learn to manage those value systems so that as you go in with the client, you can work with who they are as a person from their system and leaving your judgments at the door. Does that make sense? 

00:25:00
SHANNON HODGES It makes sense. The only, mind, again, what I would say is I, I just hope, Dr. Francis, you and the other faculty are doing this with the other students, because they are having real trouble leaving their judgments at the door. I, I, I wish, I wish there was somebody who could be my champion. I feel like the values that are championed are the liberal values, and this is definitely a liberal profession. I still feel like I can be a helper as a conservative, but I, I don't, I just wonder, not my business, but I wonder how often my fellow students get called in to meet with the professor for their judgments. 

00:25:35
PERRY C. FRANCIS You know, and I appreciate that. You know I can't share that with you. 

00:25:40
SHANNON HODGES I understand that. 

00:25:40
PERRY C. FRANCIS I want to, I want to walk down a couple of other things that may help you understand how we can manage this for you. And then I want to talk a bit about how we can help expand it for you. Okay? Can you be respectful with your clients beliefs related to their presenting concern? 

00:26:00
SHANNON HODGES I believe I've been very respectful. I've been respectful to this person that, that brought the issue up, you know. I didn't, I mean, I, I really feel like I was. 

00:26:05
PERRY C. FRANCIS And if the client's issue was something that you're either competent to deal with or you could get competent quickly, could you see yourself doing that? 

00:26:20
SHANNON HODGES Yes. 

00:26:20
PERRY C. FRANCIS Okay. So, how might your reaction change for say a client who is gay if the demographics were different? In other words, the issue is something you can work with, but it's a male and female client. 

00:26:35
SHANNON HODGES Well, let me say something. Here, here's what that you're asking. I mean, I, I, your saying your not asking me to change my values. Okay. Okay, I appreciate that. But, I've grown up, my father is a Southern Baptist minister. All right, I know you know about that. You've studied other religions. All right, I've been taught these are our values. Okay. I hear that you're saying I can keep the values. Okay, I got it. I got that. But, it's really hard, it's really hard to sit down and put that behind me. It's, it was a core value of who we were, who we are as a movement. And to, to not have that intruding between our relationship, I mean, I can see me working really hard to not let it. I don't know if I can do that, and I don't, I mean, I can, I can certainly see me trying. I want to get through this program and be a good counselor. What if I can't do that? 

00:27:35
PERRY C. FRANCIS You know, that's a good question. What if you can't? 

00:27:35
SHANNON HODGES What if I can't do that? 

00:27:35
Perry C. Francis 

00:27:35
PERRY C. FRANCIS You fall back on what we've talked about. Supervision, consultation, education. And if after that that doesn't work, you do it again. You work hard to understand your client from their worldview as you struggle with your own . Always under supervision, if you need to be to protect the client and to provide for the client. See, and that goes to the next part. Are you willing to expand your competence in working with a diverse client population? 

00:28:15
SHANNON HODGES I feel like I worked so hard to understand other people. You know, I'm really... 

00:28:20
PERRY C. FRANCIS I get the feeling you don't feel enough understanding. 

00:28:25
Shannon Hodges 

00:28:25
SHANNON HODGES I, I don't. I don't feel understood. I feel very judged. I feel very hurt. I feel like, I just want once for somebody to care about me. Why can't people care about me? What's so wrong with me? What's so bad with me? 

00:28:45
PERRY C. FRANCIS And that's hard to hear all the time. 

00:28:50
SHANNON HODGES (inaudible ) 

00:28:55
PERRY C. FRANCIS And I want to you to hear that is that there is nothing wrong with you. That's what we are working on is helping you be the best that you can be, the best counselor that you can be. 

00:29:05
SHANNON HODGES I, I, I, my mom is a teacher. She was so happy when I got in the program, finally got my life. You know, I had a hard time after the military. I got my life going in the right direction , you know. Got back in the church that I was, you know, Team Jesus Christ, and all that stuff, you know. It's just hard to be told constantly that you're wrong, and you're bad, and that's how it feels. I'll do what I can. You know, it's not going to, I don't think this is going to be easy. 

00:29:50
PERRY C. FRANCIS No, no. I don't think it's going to be easy either. Just like it's not easy for anybody when they're being asked to, to dig deep, to look inside. I know I struggle with it every day. And I know that you can do it, and that we are here to struggle with you and be with you on that journey. I want you to know that. Okay? 

00:30:10
SHANNON HODGES I, I just want to feel, one more time, I, I appreciate the understanding and the brackets and all that. It would be nice to when I do role plays in class, when I speak in class if I didn't feel attacked. People don't have to agree with me. I wish they would bracket their values off a little bit more. I'm not saying that if they don't agree with me they shouldn't have to. That's why I joined the military, all right? They should get their right. I just want the right to be different too. 

00:30:45
PERRY C. FRANCIS You want the right to be different. 

00:30:45
SHANNON HODGES Yes I do. Yeah. Oddly enough, yeah. Maybe, I, I, I get what... 

00:30:50
PERRY C. FRANCIS Be affirmed for who you are. 

00:30:50
SHANNON HODGES Right. I want to that. 

00:30:50
PERRY C. FRANCIS You want to be affirmed and supported for who you are. 

00:30:55
SHANNON HODGES Yeah, I'd like that. That would be nice. 

00:30:55
PERRY C. FRANCIS So, I want to check in with you right now. Do you feel that now? 

00:31:00
SHANNON HODGES You and I? 

00:31:00
PERRY C. FRANCIS Yeah. 

00:31:00
SHANNON HODGES Ironically, yes. You know, oddly, yes. I do. I'm going to have to, Dr. Francis, I'm going to have to sort through this a bit. I, I can't make promises other than I'll do my best. 

00:31:15
PERRY C. FRANCIS Sure, sure. 

00:31:15
SHANNON HODGES But, yeah, yeah. Oddly enough I do feel this, feel listened to. 

00:31:20
PERRY C. FRANCIS Okay. I want you to know that. I want you to feel this right now, because this is what we want you to learn to do with your clients. Now, in order for that to happen, I, what I want to build a plan for you, with you actually. Not for you, with you. 

00:31:35
SHANNON HODGES This is like an IAP, yeah? 

00:31:35
PERRY C. FRANCIS If you want to call it that. 

00:31:40
SHANNON HODGES Okay. I was on one of those in high school. Okay. 

00:31:45
PERRY C. FRANCIS This isn't to the type where, you know, somehow there is something wrong with you. This is the type of IAP where we are helping you gain more knowledge to be an effective counselor. 

00:31:55
SHANNON HODGES Yeah, I, I have to admit. It feels like there's something wrong with me or we wouldn't be doing this. I mean, I, I know you won't tell me, and I won't ask. I know that there have been other students who have been on plans for various reasons, you know. So, it feels like I've done something wrong. Honestly. 

00:32:10
PERRY C. FRANCIS Sure, sure. Uh, have you ever, have you ever tried to bake bread? 

00:32:20
SHANNON HODGES Sorry? 

00:32:20
PERRY C. FRANCIS Have you ever tried to bake bread? 

00:32:20
SHANNON HODGES Oh, god, I can barely boil water. 

00:32:20
PERRY C. FRANCIS You know, some bread rises faster than others. You know, they put it in the thing and the yeast and all that. And yet, both loaves of bread are great. Sometimes it just takes a little longer for it to rise. 

00:32:35
SHANNON HODGES What are you, what are you saying to me? 

00:32:40
Perry C. Francis 

00:32:40
PERRY C. FRANCIS And that's what I want you to understand is sometimes it just takes a little longer to, a little more time for things to germinate so that that knowledge gets built in. And so what I want to do is work with you on helping that knowledge grow in you. I want to make some suggestions for you, something that, that this might be helpful for you, okay? Okay. The first is I've got some reading I'd like you to do. Some very specific reading about working with diverse client populations. Okay? So, what I call targeted reading. So, it's not going to have a particular agenda. It's going to be about particular populations. About, it's more about how do I work with I diverse client population? 

00:33:25
SHANNON HODGES People who are gay, you mean. 

00:33:25
PERRY C. FRANCIS No, I'm talking about people from all walks of life. 

00:33:30
SHANNON HODGES Well, okay. All right, yeah, yeah. 

00:33:35
PERRY C. FRANCIS The second thing though, is that I want to build on something that, that you have already and that's your religious belief. Now, I know you go to church close by. 

00:33:45
SHANNON HODGES I do. Yeah. 

00:33:45
PERRY C. FRANCIS So, there are other churches close by that I don't like you to check into. Now, I have a real good friend of mine who is a pastor at the Metropolitan Community Church of Christ down the road. 

00:34:00
SHANNON HODGES I've seen it. 

00:34:00
PERRY C. FRANCIS Okay. Now, I'm going to be perfectly upfront for you. This is a church that's very open to people who are gay and lesbian. Okay? 

00:34:05
Shannon Hodges 

00:34:05
SHANNON HODGES The church? 

00:34:10
PERRY C. FRANCIS Mm-hmm. 

00:34:10
SHANNON HODGES Do they have the same Bible you and I have? 

00:34:10
PERRY C. FRANCIS They have the same Bible. 

00:34:10
SHANNON HODGES Do they cut, do they cut versus out of that or what do they do, you know? 

00:34:15
PERRY C. FRANCIS They look at things from a different point of view. And what I don't like to do is have you talk to the pastor. 

00:34:25
SHANNON HODGES You're not saying I have to join this church. 

00:34:25
PERRY C. FRANCIS No. 

00:34:25
SHANNON HODGES I mean. 

00:34:25
PERRY C. FRANCIS Not at all. 

00:34:30
SHANNON HODGES All right. 

00:34:30
PERRY C. FRANCIS All I'm asking you to do is to go talk to the pastor. 

00:34:35
SHANNON HODGES Okay. What... 

00:34:35
PERRY C. FRANCIS What I want you to do is go talk to the pastor, share some of your concerns. Now, I know this guy. But I want you to go talk to him and hear what he has to say about the people he works with and how he works with a very diverse group of people. 

00:34:55
SHANNON HODGES Are they all gay down there? 

00:34:55
PERRY C. FRANCIS No. 

00:34:55
SHANNON HODGES There are straight people there too? 

00:34:55
PERRY C. FRANCIS That's right. 

00:34:55
SHANNON HODGES There's straight people and gay people. 

00:35:00
PERRY C. FRANCIS Yeah. 

00:35:00
SHANNON HODGES In the same church. 

00:35:00
PERRY C. FRANCIS Yeah. 

00:35:00
SHANNON HODGES Worshiping the same God? 

00:35:05
PERRY C. FRANCIS Same God you and I worship. 

00:35:05
SHANNON HODGES Really. How do they do that? 

00:35:05
PERRY C. FRANCIS Well, that's what you're going to go find out. 

00:35:10
SHANNON HODGES Well, I never had a Sunday school class like that. 

00:35:20
PERRY C. FRANCIS Well, you said you would be open to finding out. 

00:35:20
SHANNON HODGES I'll work, I'll work at it. I'll work at it. 

00:35:25
PERRY C. FRANCIS So, what I'd like is to have you write a reflection paper about that. Okay? So some targeted reading, visit with this particular pastor and write a reflection paper about that conversation that you have with him. And I'd like you to meet with them more than once. 

00:35:40
SHANNON HODGES Is this counseling? 

00:35:40
PERRY C. FRANCIS No. This isn't counseling. 

00:35:45
SHANNON HODGES Okay. Well, what if, what if I meet with him, and he's probably a nice guy, right? Okay. Because I know there are, because there are nice people in our class who I don't agree with. I mean, like one of the people in the class, she's a staunch Democrat. She's nice. She's one of the few people I can talk with there. But, I might not agree with them, so should I, what should I tell you in the reflection paper? Just? 

00:36:05
Perry C. Francis 

00:36:05
PERRY C. FRANCIS We'll talk about what questions I'm going to ask you to answer in the reflection paper, okay? All right. 

00:36:15
SHANNON HODGES Okay. 

00:36:15
PERRY C. FRANCIS Targeted reading, visiting with his pastor, okay? The first two steps. After that, I'm going to want to meet with you and talk about what the next steps might be. Okay? 

00:36:30
SHANNON HODGES All right. 

00:36:30
PERRY C. FRANCIS And in, in this particular case, what we are trying to do is help build on what you already know to help you develop further so that you can be the best, the best pasture. Here I am, here we go. The best counselor that you could be. 

00:36:45
SHANNON HODGES 

00:36:45
SHANNON HODGES Well, I actually might be a pastor someday. I think after I finish, after I get licensed I might go to seminary. So, because there's a lot of pastors, will you know this, who don't have good mental health training. My dad is, and he doesn't have good training. He's a nice guy, but these, I don't think he's so good in counseling, you know. 

00:37:05
PERRY C. FRANCIS And it's been my experience that, you know, there's a much, there's a huge difference between pastoral care and real counseling. 

00:37:10
SHANNON HODGES That I would agree with. 

00:37:10
PERRY C. FRANCIS And that's, that's an important thing for you to separate should you head in that direction. 

00:37:15
SHANNON HODGES Yeah. Well, first things first. 

00:37:20
PERRY C. FRANCIS So, we need to review. 

00:37:20
SHANNON HODGES All right, okay. 

00:37:20
PERRY C. FRANCIS Let's talk about, again, being able to separate your values from your client's, not impose them on your client and to hold them in abeyance. 

00:37:30
SHANNON HODGES I, I'm going to struggle with how do I do that. It sounds, I know what you're saying, but how do we do that? 

00:37:40
PERRY C. FRANCIS We are going to, were going to talk about that. We're going to struggle with that together. Second thing, it's that we enter that relationship, and you know this, in a non-judgmental way. And to leave our values at the door so we can enter the world of the client. Three, is that when those do bleed through, and they bleed through for everybody, is we seek supervision, consultation and education. So that we can ask ourselves, if the demographics of my client were different, I'd be able to work with that person. So what is it about the demographics. I need to get some supervision, consultation and education. 

00:38:20
SHANNON HODGES Oh boy. 

00:38:20
PERRY C. FRANCIS And that's part of what this is, this remediation is about, is helping you with supervision, consultation and education. 

00:38:25
SHANNON HODGES I'm back to remediation again. 

00:38:30
PERRY C. FRANCIS Yeah. I'm afraid so. I'm afraid so. The other piece I really want you to hear, I want to really reinforce this again, is that this isn't about judging you in the sense of, I'm saying your values are bad. I want you to know they are your values, and I respect you for having your values. 

00:38:50
SHANNON HODGES Well, I, I do appreciate that. I do feel respected by you. I would be less than honest if I didn't say I frequently don't feel that in class. I feel very guarded. I feel I can't say what's on my mind, what my opinions are because my experience is when I do that I get labeled, I get attacked, I get the shit beat, I get beaten up. Sorry. Sorry, I shouldn't have said that to a professor, but that's how I feel. 

00:39:20
PERRY C. FRANCIS Sure, you feel like you get... 

00:39:20
SHANNON HODGES I do. I feel very devalued. And, and it hurts. I didn't mean to cry in front of you. I don't do that in front of people, but it just really taps into that. I, I don't, people don't have to like me, but I just want to be, feel respected also. 

00:39:35
PERRY C. FRANCIS Yeah, and you felt respected in here. 

00:39:35
SHANNON HODGES I did. 

00:39:40
PERRY C. FRANCIS And what we want to do then is work together to help build on your education through supervision, consultation and education. So, targeted reading, and then we're going to work with Pastor Jones over at the MCC. I'll let him know that you're coming. Just so you know, he's done this for us before. 

00:40:00
SHANNON HODGES Okay. 

00:40:00
PERRY C. FRANCIS Okay? So, he's, he's aware. He'll keep everything confidential, and he'll meet with you. Okay? Are you ready to do that? 

00:40:05
SHANNON HODGES I'll do it. I want, I want to finish this program. 

00:40:10
PERRY C. FRANCIS Can we work together? 

00:40:10
SHANNON HODGES You and I? Yeah. 

00:40:10
PERRY C. FRANCIS All right. Thank you very much. 

00:40:10
SHANNON HODGES Sure. 

00:40:15
PERRY C. FRANCIS Stop. I don't know about you, but that was intense for me. It was intense for me. Questions? 

00:40:25
How do we create a learning environment where somebody can feel validated but put their values aside? 

00:40:25
PERRY C. FRANCIS So, one of the things that I want to reflect on this a little bit, and Shannon, join me if you want. 

00:40:35
SHANNON HODGES Sure. 

00:40:35
Perry C. Francis This goes back to the second piece, which is how do we create a learning environment where somebody can feel validated for who they are and yet hear the message that we need to put that aside as we enter the world of the client. Not give it up. Not say that that is wrong even though in your heart of hearts it might be. Gee, that would involve our modeling for our students what it is we expect them to do with their clients. Okay? And that's part of the point. That's why I didn't get into the argument of name-calling other professors. I didn't want to go there with him. 

00:41:20
How do we help our students understand the difference between the ability to treat and the values? 

00:41:20
Perry C. Francis 

00:41:20
PERRY C. FRANCIS You bring up a very good, excuse me, a very good question, because this is a question that went specifically to (inaudible) as well as a few other cases that go on this. How do we help our students understand as counselors that, and it says in the ethics you don't enter into a relationship with the client if you do not have the ability to treat. I want to make sure that everybody understands the difference between the ability to treat, competence and values. Childs(ph), 2009 asks these questions, these six questions. She did a wonderful job in an article which was based on her dissertation dealing with this question. Okay? It's, and the answer is we have to separate values from competence. Yes. And trust me, it's going to get clearer. Based on your training and experience, do you feel competent to work with this client? Here are the two words: training and experience. Training and experience, okay? Can you be respectful of your clients beliefs related to their presenting concerns? How might your reaction to this client differ from your reaction to a client with a similar issue but a different demographic variable? Now that's the catch. That's the real kicker. That's the hook. Because that's the difference between competence and values. And know, in the preamble to the ACA ethical code, and it gets clearer. And if you haven't yet, the 2014 draft code is up online. We will have an ethics revision task force town hall meeting tomorrow. I can't tell you the exact time, I'll be facilitating that. Okay? 

00:43:15
SHANNON HODGES Two o'clock. 

00:43:20
PERRY C. FRANCIS Two o'clock? Okay. Thank you. But, that's the difference in, that's the hook is if the demographic were different, then what's the issue? You identify the issue. Can you expand your competence regarding this issue through reading, supervision or other professional activities? Now think about that for a moment. We've bracketed off those values. You've bracketed them off and put them aside. And now it's about competence, because the ethics are clear. It's about competence, not values. Are you willing to work on expanding your competence, and if not, why? That is a gatekeeping issue. And that's a gatekeeping issue for students and practitioners. Okay? We are trained to work with a diverse body of clients, and that is what we are asked to do. If it's beyond our competence, then we either seek to get more competent or we refer because we cannot get competent quickly enough. And there's a difference, okay. How many people here have worked with clients who you didn't feel real competent, but you were able to, to get that competence up and running pretty quickly. Okay. Is this an area that the counseling profession, and this we didn't get to, but is this an area that the counseling profession regards as essential for competent practice? Ladies and gentlemen, the ability to work with a diverse client population is in the Krup(ph) standards. It's in the ACA ethics, and it's just simple common human decency. 

00:44:55
Is there such thing as valueless counseling? How do you measure whether a counselor can bracket their values? 

00:44:55
Perry C. Francis 

00:44:55
PERRY C. FRANCIS The first is right, and how do we deal with that? Because there's no such thing as valueless counseling, because clients, through research we know this, tend to gravitate towards the counselor's values. And that's when you work with supervision and consultation to make sure that you're doing your best, because there will be bleed through. There always is. It would be foolish to say that there isn't. But, that's where you work with a colleague. We are trained to work as lone rangers. We are. We are afraid to go get supervision many times because were afraid somebody's going to think were incompetent. It's the incompetent counselor who doesn't get supervision that increases incompetence. It's the competent counselor who is deficient and goes and gets supervision and continued education that is competent, becomes more competent. The second piece to your question is how do you measure that. 

00:45:45
UNKNOWN At some point in time, you will evaluate Shannon's character and say you're checking your values at the door or you were not and you have evidence to suggest that. How do you evaluate that? 

00:46:00
PERRY C. FRANCIS You know, I think the best way to do that, that's a good question. I have no, I have no hard and fast assessment other than a good DVD. To sit down and go step-by-step through somebody's interaction with the client and ask them in a nonjudgmental way, "Wwhere were you here. What was happening here?" That's difficult, especially if Shannon demonstrated so readily the feeling that I am on the spit, and I'm about ready to get roasted. And then that comes back for us on how do we create in our own classrooms that atmosphere that you were, that you can do that. That you can, we will listen to you. Now let me bring it back go to a gatekeeping issue. And that's, and I want to address what this whole session was about, which was remediation. It's in essence helping the student feel joined with and walking that path towards greater supervision, consultation and education. I, I really want to hammer away at this because this is important for you to know. Is that if the student feels as if, you know, that this is a, a judgment on them in the sense of, you know, "Bad, bad student. You've wet the floor. You know, we're going to rub your nose in it and spank you and send you out the door." That's not going to work. What it is is that I respect you, I want you to understand that what we want to do is build upon your knowledge base and expand that. One of the best things what we stop students halfway through practicum or at the end of practicum is to ask them to repeat, is let students know, you know, sometimes it just takes a little longer for good wine to sit in the rack and gets to be better wine. Okay, I like food analogies. 

00:47:55
SHANNON HODGES And some wine may never get there. 

00:47:55
PERRY C. FRANCIS Some wine may never get there. 

00:48:00
SHANNON HODGES Some wine may never get there. We may pour it out. 

00:48:00
PERRY C. FRANCIS And, and the most important part is exactly that. How do we counsel somebody out of the profession appropriately. Not telling them that your bad, but that for some people this isn't the profession for you. 

00:48:15
Do you have to meter what your goals are for this intervention? Are you comfortable with the outcome today? 

00:48:15
Perry C. Francis 

00:48:15
PERRY C. FRANCIS Yeah. I, it's going to have to be, because if I push too far, I'm setting the student up for failure. 

00:48:20
SHANNON HODGES But, but I would argue that at the end, the character I'm playing is moving toward contemplation, because he is, I think there is a shift there. And I think in the role, just in that character mode, as a former C or D grade actor, the, what I think was so important for my character was it wasn't pounded into me. So, and, I think with hard. I go back to what you were saying, Stephen, I think what's hard for a lot of faculty, particularly more liberal faculty, and I would say that's me, is how to work with a hot button issue like this without the student feeling judged. And it isn't always going to be sexual orientation, but that is the hottest button right now. 

00:49:10
PERRY C. FRANCIS That, that is one. 

00:49:10
SHANNON HODGES So, how can you do it? I think Perry's example was really well done. So, I think having, knowing where you're going. I think you need a clear idea of where you're going, and in the meantime, with somebody in pre-contemplation like this character, you have to be very instructive, very patient and very nonreactive. Because, with a different professor, this character would've blown out of there. 

00:49:30
PERRY C. FRANCIS Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you so much. For Shannon, are great student. Take care.
