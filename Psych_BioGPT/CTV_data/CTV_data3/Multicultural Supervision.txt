Microtraining Associates, Inc. MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development 888 - 505 - 5576 info@emicrotraining.com www.emicrotraining.com Multicultural Supervision Anika K. Warren Melissa Corpus Teachers College, Columbia University This video is an update on the career progression and personal development of a client who participated in the Microtraining video entitled Career Counseling: Multi-ethnic Demonstrations - Career Counseling Skills for Contextual Decision Making. The client is not an actor. He is a person who agreed to share his personal and professional experiences while reflecting on his future. In this video, Melissa Corpus, an advanced doctoral student in Counseling Psychology at Teachers College, Columbia University, counsels Douglas. Afterwards, Dr. Warren provides Melissa Corpus with a full multi-cultural supervision session. This video was not scripted. The client, counselor, and supervisor agreed to conduct impromptu material to maintain the authenticity of their work together. Counseling Expectations: A Client's Perspective In the following chapter, Douglas describes his counseling experiences and expectations. As you listen to Douglas, please consider your own experiences in counseling as a client or clinician and how your background (race, gender, ethnicity, social class, age, abilities, and religion) might influence your work with Douglas. 

00:01:25
MELISSA CORPUS Douglas! 

00:01:25
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:01:25
MELISSA CORPUS I wondered if you could tell me a little bit now ah... about what you usually expect from counseling? 

00:01:35
DOUGLAS Ah... I've had pretty limited experience with counseling and I... you know, when I've reached out and tried counseling, what I've looked for is somebody to serve as a sounding board, ah... what I haven't liked is when people, I-I feel that people have taken like a backseat and just kind of listened. Ah... I wanted a lot of ah... kind of pushback and feedback. Ah... I'd want... I'd want I guess what I'd call more of proactive type of counselor, ah... because you know I wanna a... I wanna get something out of the session, ah... and on a regular basis. I think, ah... in my past experience of counseling, I kind of feel like I kinda hit a wall with it and, and nothing, probably nothing about him, nothing about me, but just kind of the whole milieu of it, it was a kind of, I just kind of called it a wrap, ah... So, I really want somebody who can, kind of interact with me and kind of engage with me, much like someone in my life would when they provide support, but from a very objective perspective. Ah... You know one thing I've thought about a lot is kind of what type of counselor I would want, like someone who is more aligned with my personal experiences or someone who is outside of it and my, one of my early assumptions is that I would want somebody who was queer, or was a person of color, ah... And when I actually, and actually, and ended up trying one on one counseling, ah... this person was not-he was a heterosexual white man, ah... even though he was familiar with lot of LGBT queer issues and so- and it actually worked out great, so it kind of opened up my perspective a little bit about kind of that side of it, who I could ask for support from and who would actually understand, but again I think it was a little more about our, inter... interpersonal dynamics kind of, something you should have... 

00:03:30
REFLECTIVE QUESTIONS Consider the following questions in small groups or supervision • What were your reactions to Douglas' description of his counseling experiences and expectations? • Without knowing much about Douglas' presenting concerns, what theoretical orientations and approaches would you consider using with him given what he just shared? • What theoretical orientations and approaches do you think might be inappropriate with Douglas? • Are you comfortable discussing multicultural issues with clients? Are you familiar with the appropriate terms and definitions when discussing culturally different clients in session or supervision? • What are your biases and assumptions when: A. Listening to Douglas in the prior segment? Please keep those in mind throughout the video. B. Working with different demographic or cultural groups of people? C. Working with people from your own demographic or cultural groups? How might these help or hinder you in the counseling process? Information Gathering and Establishing Rapport In the following chapter, Douglas gives Melissa an overview of his work with Dr. Warren and Melissa establishes rapport with Douglas by applying active listening skills, suspending judgment, expressing acceptance of him, and learning his personal background and professional goals. 

00:05:05
DOUGLAS I'm actually still working with communities of color, which is something I appreciate, ah... but definitely kind of learning as a young person ah... and developing professionally, kind of interfacing with these different, ah... kind of systems of management and kind of figure out how I fit into it. 

00:05:20
MELISSA CORPUS Okay. 

00:05:20
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:05:20
MELISSA CORPUS So how are you liking it so far? 

00:05:25
DOUGLAS Ah... I like it, in that it's, it allows me to kind of work with lot of people and meet people ah... ah... it gives me a fair amount of responsibility, but, you know, not so much that I'm going crazy. 

00:05:35
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:05:35
DOUGLAS Ah... I've also recently started night school in a Masters degree program full time. Ah... So, it's great that it's a good balance between my day, my day job and my night school. So it's a healthy fit. 

00:05:50
MELISSA CORPUS So you're, you are doing a lot. You... You're working nine to five, you also started ah... graduate school. So, what, what specifically are you doing, pursuing? 

00:06:00
DOUGLAS Yeah. I am getting a degree in urban planning. So, while I was doing a lot of community health work, ah... being on the program side and the management side of things for a number of years ah... I actually, maybe it's because I felt a little burned out by that work, ah... I decided to go back to some of my early interest around local community development... 

00:06:15
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:06:15
DOUGLAS ...ah, kind of working with the communities, mainly communities of color and low income communities, ah... And I, you know at the time, I thought, you know an urban planning degree, you know, wanting to go more into the design kind of field too, was something I wanted to do more long term, so that's how I chose and I'm about half way through my degree as well. 

00:06:35
MELISSA CORPUS So, it sounds like you're merging some of your interest in terms of community outreach, common working people of communities of color, ah... what specifically are you doing, in terms of the design aspect of it? 

00:06:50
DOUGLAS Ah... You know one, one thing I appreciate is that, it was difficult for me to incorporate this into my public health work is, you know I actually worked as a theatrical carpenter for many years. 

00:07:00
MELISSA CORPUS Wow! 

00:07:00
DOUGLAS Ah... And I really liked just, you know, the construction of things. I've always really personally been very interested in architecture and, and designs, so the approach I like to take for urban planning, it's not only the kind of the policy side of things, but also kind of the design of spaces... 

00:07:15
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... 

00:07:20
DOUGLAS ...especially looking at communities and how we, you know, one can design communities towards and also a kind of social programing goal I'm involved as well. 

00:07:25
MELISSA CORPUS Okay. 

00:07:25
DOUGLAS So, it's like, that's why I'd like to explore more, as I go to school. 

00:07:30
MELISSA CORPUS So what you think your plans are in the future, what you foresee yourself doing this degree? 

00:07:35
DOUGLAS Ah... You know I feel kind of torn, because where I'm at now, I've had, I've had, I've dabbled very much in this kind of, I guess what I call like a white-collar track of work, right... 

00:07:45
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:07:50
DOUGLAS So office work, administrative work, ah... government work, ah... but there is a part of it that still stays really involved and invested in kind of grassroots type work. Ah... You know, I'm on the board of an organization, I do lot of work with them for an organizing program as well too, ah... working with Asian immigrant communities in New York ah... And so, you know actually it's one thing I grabbled with and it's like I really care about ah... a lot of local development work... 

00:08:15
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:08:15
DOUGLAS ah... and you know self-determination issues in a place like New York City ah... but doing that kind of work is totally exhausting. And ah... I'm down for doing it and putting my all into it in a volunteer capacity, I think, making it my nine to five is more of a challenge. 

00:08:30
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... 

00:08:30
DOUGLAS Ah... And so I see myself going into more of ah... you know, for lack of a better word more like a white-collar respective on the work, I'd love to do some planning for the city or for kind of firms in the city, that, that do local ah... affordable housing or community development. Well, right now I'm kind of torn you know it's like two value systems... 

00:08:50
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:08:50
DOUGLAS ...that one I feel, isn't more comfortable, one I feel is more kind of, I'm more deeply rooted in some of the grassroots work. Ah... So, I'm, I'm also taking the time to figure out exactly what I wanna do, how I'm going to balance it out, you know, what path I'd rather go through. 

00:09:10
MELISSA CORPUS So what you think is pushing you more towards the nine to five white-collar work, as you say? 

00:09:15
DOUGLAS Ah... You know I think, I think it's the ease of it, so you know, in the limited organizing work that I've done, it's really, it's like a... Well firt off, I don't know if I'd be the best at organizing work full time, but I also think that, it takes up so much of you life and your, your emotional energy. 

00:09:35
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:09:35
DOUGLAS Ah... And you know the office job, you know you can put into it, but you know, it ends at the end of the day. Ah... I need to be honest too, you know, I grew up kind of working poor, working class so now that I've had the opportunity that I've been afforded I feel, you know, I would rather be making like a moderate to higher salary... 

00:09:55
MELISSA CORPUS Ah... 

00:09:55
DOUGLAS You know, ah... supporting myself, supporting my family members ah... And so it's weird, you know. It's weird. So it's just kind of little things that I deal with. 

00:10:05
MELISSA CORPUS So what are your family's expectations around you contributing to your fa- their income, your household's income? 

00:10:10
DOUGLAS Sure. I mean I've been supporting myself for a while probably since, you know, I moved to New York when I was 17. Ah... and my family was back in Boston. Ah...Their demands aren't as high, like you know, I help out like here and there, ah... but it definitely kind of thinking long term that my parents are getting older now, and they don't work anymore. I wanna be able to provide for myself and my life here in addition to, you know helping out my parents, ah... my littlest brother is still in college, so, you know they need some help with him too. Ah... So it's so much, it's not as much of a demand, but it's really about you know having ah... that freedom, right, that, you know, steady source of income and enough income to go around brings in that ah... that comfort, say if someone did need something, you know it wouldn't be an issue for me to give, right. Ah... So that's very cultural, at least in my family. 

00:11:05
MELISSA CORPUS Is it more so because you're a son or are their expectations for any of your other siblings? 

00:11:10
DOUGLAS Right. Ah... I think pretty equal, ah... across the board at least in terms of like ah... like anything financial or like resource support. Ah... I think for a while my parents floated the idea of me being the son that they settle in with, move in with in older age, even though I am- I have an older brother who's about 12 years older than me, but they don't have such a close relationship. Ah... My parents and I have always had a very close relationship. So, ah... this is one of thier inklings of an idea, I think at this point they've basically scrapped it cause they know that basically all five of their kids, have their own life, they're gonna do their own thing, ah... ah... but you know we try to be there for them too. They're also in another city. I don't see either one of us switching any times soom, my parents and me. 

00:12:00
MELISSA CORPUS So how would you feel if they did ah... rely on you in terms of moving in and ah... as they get older? 

00:12:05
DOUGLAS You know, that's a difficult question, you know, I think, I would feel very torn and very conflicted, I mean, ah... the selfish side of me says that I love my life here, you know, I live with my boyfriend of several years now, we have our life. And in a way it's been very convenient that, you know, I have my life here and then I go home and then I enter that life, right. So, I don't really foresee it, even as a possibility of us trying to move in together and make it work. Ah... I hope that you know, if my parents ever did need that kind of support, I could provide it, I could even move back to Boston, but not live with them. Hahaha... 

00:12:45
MELISSA CORPUS Okay. Hahaha... 

00:12:45
DOUGLAS Ah... So you know, I think, you know, try to find some middle ground, but to be honest, you know the selfish side of me thinks that you know, you know, this is my life here, I need to enjoy some of that, I mean, and not give and give and just give. Yeah. 

00:13:00
MELISSA CORPUS Ah... Ah... Well, it seems like in some ways you've already ah... met some that middle ground where you, your earning, I mean the moderate income as you say, it's feeble to get them some money, I mean, but also meet your needs as well ah... in terms of living here in New York. 

00:13:15
SUMMARY: In that chapter, Douglas shared openly and Melissa followed his lead through most of the segment. She then used hypothesis testing to gain greater insight about Douglas. Specifically, toward the end of that segment, Melissa gently nudged Douglas by asking a hypothetical question about how he might feel in a specific situation. He responded in a way that allowed him to explore the hypothesis she presented, and she responded to him by affirming, validating, and reframing what he shared. Keep in mind the following based on the intake segment you just watched • Melissa gathered information about Douglas cultural context by asking him questions about his gender role, family expectations, and his personal expectations. • It is not always necessary to ask specific or direct questions about culture or to assume that a client's presenting concerns are related to their race, gender, sexual orientation, social class, or other cultural groups. • It is important to recognize how a client's demographic or culture may be influenced by experiences of prejudice, oppression, privilege, and/or access and to determine when such material is appropriate or inappropriate to integrate into your clinical work. • Seek support from consultants, supervisors, experts, professors, colleagues, and literature focused on core content that your clients present in counseling. MEANING MAKING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND A CLIENT'S CULTURAL CONTEXT In the following chapter, Melissa uses meaning making and clarifying to understand and help Douglas explore how he understands his cultural groups, terms he associates with his behaviors, and familial roles and boundaries. Such strategies allowed Douglas to actively explore his own assumptions early in his work, and also allowed Melissa to gain a better understanding of Douglas' point of view. For example, when working with clients, a counselor might ask questions such as "what does being selfish mean to you" and "how does it inform your relationships and roles?" 

00:15:40
MELISSA CORPUS You mentioned something about, I am here in selfish that you want to have your life live in your apartment with your partner ah... as supposed to moving back to Boston and having your parents to live with you. 

00:16:00
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:16:00
 Can you tell me a little bit more about that? 

00:16:00
DOUGLAS Yeah. Ah... I mean, it's definitely a lot of, I think the programming I got growing up. 

00:16:05
MELISSA CORPUS Umm... Umm... 

00:16:05
DOUGLAS Ah... You know my parents ah... they actually my parents and my older siblings are first generations, so they came in from Vietnam. You know, at home they grew up very culturally, programmed ah... kind of with a lot of values and, you know I could label as Vietnamese, kind of a lot of, kind of expectations of the family, giving all to the family, ah... especially considering that we have no extended family here in the country. 

00:16:30
MELISSA CORPUS Umm... Umm... 

00:16:30
DOUGLAS You know, us and my parents and the five of us, brothers and sisters, were this kind of self-contained unit in a lot of ways, taking care of one another... 

00:16:35
MELISSA CORPUS Umm... Umm... 

00:16:40
DOUGLAS ...ah, relying on one another supporting one another. Ah... And I think, I feel, I've these kind of, I guess I used the word selfish because it's a, it's against this programming that I have. Like I feel like, I know that I don't wanna give everything and all to my family, ah... but still somehow I feel like I should give them more. And at times, that I struggled with it for a long time, ah... around kind of how much to give, where to draw boundaries. 

00:17:05
MELISSA CORPUS Umm... Umm... 

00:17:05
DOUGLAS Ah... I am in a much more comfortable place now than I had been say couple of years ago... 

00:17:10
MELISSA CORPUS Umm... Umm... 

00:17:10
DOUGLAS ...where ah... that's for example, couple of years ago, I would give it, give it, give, and then feel burned out and that not want to talk to them right or not wanna to really deal with it, ah... until I got dragged back into another crisis. Ah... I think what I learned from that was that, you know, then my relationship became all about crisis and it didn't- there was all those in-betweens, you know with a where you, you know, where you just spend time in your family and things are normal, ah... that I missed out on them in a way because I was just kind of not balancing how much they asked at me and how much I could give. Ah... So I think in that way, ah... that's where it's harder sometimes. Ah... But I am okay with it. 

00:17:50
MELISSA CORPUS So it seems like you've ah... been really conditioned to ah... be really dep-, interdependent, and ah... and really provide for not only your parents, but also your siblings as well. So, can you give me a specific example of ah... how you come to terms and have met that middle ground, that has been comfortable for you ah... as well as ah... comfortable in meeting expectations for your family? 

00:18:20
DOUGLAS Right. Ah... let's see. I think you know one recent struggle we've been having is my little brother, who is actually entering his sophmore year of college right now, ah... he is, you know, the baby of the family much younger than me, who is the second youngest, ah... there's just a lot of struggles that freak my parents out, like he's trying to get a job, he struggled at the school, they don't like the people hangs out around, you know. And it's, for older siblings we are very, like we did our, we did everything, they didn't watch us, whatever, but they've had to be really hands on with him, and being hands on parents, you know in their 60's and 70's, it's little bit of a challenge. So, we'd to remind them that actually, the older kids were far from normal and he is more actually normal for somebody who's grown up here in U.S.. But ah... you know so, some of that middle ground is around, you know, I... They are always like, you know, you should call him, you should talk to him, you know, get him to stop smoking, get him to do his homework. The things that I-I'd rather not have to be involved with. 

00:19:25
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:19:25
DOUGLAS You know, I'm not his parent. Ah... And so, I've basically kind of struck a middle ground of him, an accord ah... that you know, so we're gonna check in every two weeks, even if it is over email, because he is in Pittsburgh. 

00:19:35
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... 

00:19:35
DOUGLAS Ah... How are things going with looking for a job? How are things going in school? Are you doing all those little things that you find difficult in school? Are you reaching out for support when you need it? Ah... And that way a middle ground- he was reluctant to take on this decision, but ah... I think that way, I can try to be of support to him without being down his throat and also my parents feel comforted because they feel like I am the only one who can work with him or tell him anything that he'll listen to. Ah... And so you know, I am not, (inaudible ) to visit him, it has been a weekend there. And you know, I am not, I don't know how (inaudible ) that would be, right... 

00:20:15
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:20:15
DOUGLAS ...ah... me going there, for me and for him? Ah... But at least these kind of small ways, ah... to have them, have them feel like, you know, ah... there is somebody on their side involved in this problem, even though they feel very disempowered to do anything about it. Ah... 

00:20:35
MELISSA CORPUS In... In terms of your parents? 

00:20:35
DOUGLAS Umm... Umm... Yeah my parents. Yeah. They basically were like, you know, we have no control over him, we can't help him with anything, we can't guilt trip him into anything. "So, as long as you can stay on top of him we'll feel a little bit more at peace that at least somebody is trying to work, help him work through this stuff." 

00:20:50
MELISSA CORPUS Well, it's, it's seems as you were sharing the story it seems like, there is still some reluctance in being involved in your brother's life because... 

00:21:00
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:21:00
MELISSA CORPUS ...you were talking about feeling like, you were kinda forced to be a parent, doing that. 

00:21:10
DOUGLAS True, yeah. And... And I think you know, that's like another cultural thing too ah... um of the five of us ah... there is about a 12 to 8-year gap between the two oldest and the next two, me and my sister and then a seven-year gap between me and my little brother. So, it's kind of a, kind of a... 

00:21:25
MELISSA CORPUS Mmhm big gaps, yeah. 

00:21:25
DOUGLAS Yeah, so... And of course my parents are working all the time, they so do so, obviously the oldest ones took care of me and my sister and then when they were out of house, me and my sister took care of like each other and my little brother, ah... And you know, my parents would always support throughout, there's this history, right, of you know having to care of one another. Ah... And so I think that's all part of it too. And when we became a little bit older they're much more hands-off as parents were very strict with all of us, we are older, and they know they're 60s or 70's, that they don't wanna parents anymore. They just kind of elephant. Ah... And my little brother gives them I think more trouble than any one of us ever gave them. So ah... Yeah it's very much part of kind of our history, this kind of, this relying on one another to take care stuff. 

00:22:10
MELISSA CORPUS So it seems like ah... you are, you play a big role in your brother's upbringing compared to some of your other siblings, is it? 

00:22:20
DOUGLAS True. 

00:22:20
MELISSA CORPUS Did they mainly rely on you for that as well? 

00:22:25
DOUGLAS Ah... I guess they did, you know growing up, ah... you know beside my parents, it was me one of my older sisters who was about two years older and then my little brother who was a little kid, you know, when I was in middle school or high school. Ah... And so a lot of the house stuff fell on me and my, my sister a little bit, but even though she's a couple years older, I took care of her, even she is probably as older and my little brother, a lot growing up, on the Saturdays and stuff, when my parents were working. And so, you know, it's something that I became very used to. Ah... And I still feel like ah... I have this role in the family, ah... and when I go home too, it's a kind of switching right back. And so, you know, helping with dinner, helping things out, helping with you know any type of planning for the family. Ah... So, yeah, they're very, it's very involved family life. 

00:23:10
MELISSA CORPUS How do you understand that in terms of ah... you being really heavily involved compared to, it seems like compared to some of the other siblings... 

00:23:20
DOUGLAS Sure. 

00:23:20
MELISSA CORPUS ...that could make it, you mentioned earlier that ah... they look to you ah... in times of crisis? 

00:23:30
DOUGLAS Ah... I think there was a time especially in like during crisis, where I probably harbored some resentment for having to be like one of go-to people in the family to take care of stuff. I think at this point of my life, you know, I feel, I feel like it's, it's fine, you know, like ah... that they think we have a better, I think my parents and I have a better sense of boundaries ah... not the healthiest set of boundaries, but I guess it's like a better sense of boundary like more actual boundaries ah... even though they are very difficult to manage. Ah... And so when they need things, you know, you know, I don't really have, harbor any kind of negativity anymore around, contributing or helping out, ah... and yeah. 

00:24:15
MELISSA CORPUS Can you ah... say more about the boundaries that you need to find with your families, you previously mentioned that they aren't the healthiest set of boundaries. 

00:24:30
DOUGLAS Ah... I think... I think going back to what I was talking about earlier, ah... you know my life, one thing, if I could resolve anything with my parents, ah... it's kind of this division between my life here and my life at home. 

00:24:40
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:24:40
DOUGLAS Ah... You know, they know, they actually know, understand very little about my life in New York, you know. All my siblings know, you know that I am, that I am gay and that you know I have a partner. 

00:24:50
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:24:50
DOUGLAS My parents don't actually. So that's kind of the, kind of the stream, right that creates all the other division. So even thought my parents and I are very emotionally close... 

00:25:00
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:25:00
DOUGLAS ...ah... I know, I know most of what's going on in their lives. They know very little about what's going on in my life, except for the really safe stuff like, how's school going? Am I eating? How's work going? things like that. Ah... They don't really probe too much. They're started to probe, because I'm 26, which is pretty old in terms of, in their mindset to starting a family... 

00:25:25
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:25:25
DOUGLAS ...or approaching that. So, they are starting to probe like, you know, do you have a girlfriend ah... you know, are you in a relationship, and this kind of, I always laugh if off. 

00:25:35
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:25:35
DOUGLAS ...I just-whatever I don't want to go there right now. Ah... And over the years, I've really grappled with telling them, it's just never like the right time, because I feel like usually I want to tell them in person, but whenever I'm home in person, ah... it's like good family time. So, I don't wanna like mess it up with kind of bad news or you know, it'll be a very difficult kind of conversation or it's ah... we dealing with some kind of crisis thing and the crisis thing ah... for me it takes priority over having this really frank conversation with them, about my life and kind of where I'm going with it, personally. So that's, you know, that's some of this break. 

00:26:10
MELISSA CORPUS So, in some ways ah... you see your sexual orientation has not been important to some of the larger family issues, but at that same time ah... it's been somewhat of a barrier in communication, in terms of... 

00:26:25
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:26:25
MELISSA CORPUS ...integrating your personal life... 

00:26:30
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:26:30
MELISSA CORPUS ...with your family life. 

00:26:30
REFLECTIVE QUESTIONS 

00:26:35
Consider discussing the following questions in small groups or supervision. • Think about some of Douglas' value systems (e.g., racial/cultural, gender, and social class). How might his values influence his counseling expectations and needs, educational and professional goals, and relationship dynamics? • Explore you own biases and assumptions about family systems. How might this influence your assessment of Douglas? • Think about your knowledge of other culturally different groups and the various ways that these groups define family roles/expectations and gender roles. How culturally competent are you at this point in your training? • How might gaining Douglas' point of view be important for the therapeutic relationship? • What other questions would you consider asking Douglas at this point? MEANING MAKING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND A CLIENT'S VALUES AND BEHAVIORS In the prior segment, Melissa acknowledged the challenges that Douglas described as he attempts to meet his own needs and those of his family. Together, Douglas and Melissa explored his values and behaviors. Toward the end of that segment, Douglas came to a realization. MORE REFLECTIVE QUESTIONS Consider discussing the following questions in small groups or supervision.• Explore strategies on how to effectively highlight Douglas' conflict that he seems to have concerning his "middle ground". • At times, Douglas refers to topics in his life that can take on several meanings (e.g., "In my culture"..."crisis"). What are some other areas of this session that could benefit from clarification? • Based on your impression of Douglas thus far, how do you understand his role in his family? • How do you think Douglas understands his role? When working with clients it is important to understand how they engage interpersonally with people in their lives. In the following segment, Melissa checks in with Douglasby sharing her impression of his interpersonal interactions with his family. 

00:29:05
MELISSA CORPUS Have you ever experienced ah... honoring like your, your own needs where you, where you didn't account for your family, okay. You just, you just went on to pursue maybe it was like a career move or relationship move, you know, obviously, you've done some of that with your personal relationship? 

00:29:30
DOUGLAS Yeah. I mean I think me, when I went to college here in New York, and me deciding to stay in New York and kind of make out my life here with was kind of very much, a personal decision that I made, that they just had to understand, I mean, I think they were warning me to move back to Boston, to figure out something there. 

00:29:45
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:29:45
DOUGLAS But I was very clear that you know, I saw much more, what personally I saw New York much more as my home than Boston was at that, at that time and today still. Ah... I just saw so much more opportunities for me to pursue here as well, ah... and so it's kind of a deciding to stay here being for nine years now and both of my life here, professionally, personally is one of the decisions, ah... I think also, you know, it's a challenge, you know what the challenge is and one of the smaller, but I guess persistent decisions I have to make it on around the holidays. I mean, every relationship has an issue right, like where you spend holidays. I guess my specific context is that you know my, my boyfriend, he is actually Japanese from Japan, so all his family is in Japan and he had some friends in New York and we are, I guess they're his other family and just me, there is always a struggle of you know, do I make him go home to Boston. Ah... And in the early years, he was yes, you have to come possibly every single holiday, now it's more of a balance of you know, so in holidays, I will go home with or without him, whether he wants to come of not he is always welcome, other times he will just, just stay here, while I went to see my family, because also them not knowing our, my parents not knowing our true relationship, you know being involved for four years now, and also made things tough for him. So, I think ah... in big ways or small those are the ways that actually, I at least have to make kind of very, self-centered decisions for myself. 

00:31:20
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... Well it sounds like difficult ah... variables to contend with in terms of ah... you know deciding who goes where, particularly because, you're not out to your parents. Ah... What do you think prevents you from disclosing sexual orientation to your parents? 

00:31:40
DOUGLAS I think it's like a vulnerability, I think it's something they're not very comfortable with or... I think they, they must have a sense of something going on. 

00:31:50
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:31:50
DOUGLAS Ah... But I guess, you know I've always had a weird or it might be you know I've always, I've always felt like letting them know and ah... would be really burdensome to them. Just the stress of it. Ah... So I don't know whatever, whatever is going on, for me it's just, ah... it would be such, it would be such a challenge for them to have to deal with. Even though I'd love for them -and I'm sure they would want to be knowing what's really going on in my life and like all the, all the nitty gritty ah... And you know, I mean, I'm in a really happy relationship and I'd love to share that with them. You know what I mean? 

00:32:25
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:32:25
DOUGLAS Ah... But... It's just... It's weird. It's just... You know so much like you know that borderline, you know, they're not like violently homophobic but you know it's definitly something that they didn't grow up around, you know, used to. They know very few people and even those people they know they're distanced from yourself. Yeah. I guess, you know pretty common. 

00:32:45
MELISSA CORPUS Can you say more about ah... being, of being burden so? 

00:32:50
DOUGLAS I would hate for it to be ah... I would hate for my coming out to them to be a wedge in our relationship. You know, I don't think they would ever cut me off, cut me off like that for good. I know that it would be kind of that's really big wall for us for a long time. Ah... This used to bother me emotionally a lot more because they used to very kind of, this saddening and it would make me feel very vulnerable... 

00:33:15
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah, yeah. 

00:33:20
DOUGLAS You know, this idea that, but what's really messed up is that, I didn't, I didn't feel so sad and bad because, I felt I was losing them for a long time, actually I felt really bad about it because, if coming out of them caused this kind of break between us, I could no longer be there for them. 

00:33:35
MELISSA CORPUS Uh... yeah. 

00:33:35
DOUGLAS So, like totally messed up. Hahaha... 

00:33:40
MELISSA CORPUS And... And actually it seems like it's also really really important for you, as you ah... fulfill those obligations to and started being there for ah... Ah, So I could, I can see why, it's, it's difficult for you to ah... you know come out to them. Ah... And how have your brothers and sisters reacted to... 

00:34:00
DOUGLAS Yeah, Ah... 

00:34:00
MELISSA CORPUS ...for your sexual orientation? 

00:34:05
DOUGLAS There were really weird about when I was younger. I think, since I came out when I was really kind of like a young teenager, ah... then, they were really weird about it, but I think in time as they grew, they grew up, I grew up and now it's really like a non-issue, you knew they accept-my partner's name is Yoshi, they accept him like you know, like anyone from the family, they like him a lot ah... It's really just a non-issue with my brothers and sisters. So really, the only really kind of soft spot in that relationship with my parents and them knowing about it. 

00:34:35
MELISSA CORPUS Ah... So how has ah... finding a middle ground and keeping your, your relationships, you know in somewhat, in some ways like ah... I'm only his or you know, you're not, it seemed like you tried not to like really make waves with your family. 

00:34:50
DOUGLAS Sure. 

00:34:55
MELISSA CORPUS Ah... How does that translated into you in your work life? 

00:35:00
DOUGLAS I think it has translated. I mean I think I've had a lot of opportunities, that I have been fortunate just to have. Ah... I’ve also been very oriented to them. So I, you know, I search them out ah... I take them on responsibility, leadership opportunities. Ah... But I also often find myself where, once I'm in a place, I get a job or in a relationship, fresh relationship of what situation, and things aren't working out, I am usually not terribly proactive around changing situation. You see, my first response would be, let's make a best out of it. 

00:35:30
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... 

00:35:35
DOUGLAS Or you know, you know there are these XYZ issues… 

00:35:35
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm… Hmm... 

00:35:35
DOUGLAS …or challenges going on, ah... and instead of, and I think ah... in very passive way I try to solve it, but I'm most active around, to say, try to make a best of situation. So, I mean, I have to really think about a really concrete thing to talk about, but... 

00:35:55
MELISSA CORPUS But where do you think you learned that value from? 

00:36:00
DOUGLAS Ah... Hmm… I think just you know like little... I think I had that type of value before I started working professionally, ah... just you know, through you know, through some of my carpentry work, like you know, just go in, you have a plan, you have your resources and you go in and make it happen… 

00:36:15
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm… Hmm... 

00:36:15
DOUGLAS …you give the best job you possibly can. Like with my current job where I wanna be like, actually I think it should be done XYZ and you should change the way you're working to, to make it happen. Ah... For me it's like, I'll make small, if I can affect small changes outside of my own, kind of scope of work, then I'll advocate for that, but I am not gonna be kind of pushing anyone's buttons. I am not gonna be, I am trying to press other people, my way of working or my perspective on that work, on to some of my colleagues, even those I'm close with, but I am always like, this is what did, it might well be right and it could be wrong, so this is what I did and it worked for me it might work for you too. Ah... 

00:37:00
MELISSA CORPUS What you think prevents you from initiating ah... some of that dialogue? 

00:37:05
DOUGLAS Hmm… Ah... You know, I have experienced it in my current job and in past jobs too. I have initiated that that kind of dialogue even when it's been challenging, when if I felt like may management has been receptive for doing something about it. Like I can complain, I can put up constructive criticism ah... and challenge people pretty well, but it's the first couple of times I put it out there and the management kind of doesn't do anything with it... 

00:37:35
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm… Hmm. 

00:37:35
DOUGLAS …or pushes back or as punitive, then I like it's, okay fine, like I know where things, I know how things work, I know where... and now I know where you guys are at, let me just do my job and you keep doing your job. So, I think you know I, where I've worked with other folks who keep on pushing it and keep on pushing it, keep on pushing it, even though they might obviously hit that wall. Ah... And maybe, you know this job, while I'm enjoying it, I'm not incredibly invested in it… 

00:38:05
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm… Hmm... 

00:38:05
DOUGLAS …so it's not like a job I would die for, where there are other, other jobs were I felt are very personally important to me. 

00:38:10
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm… Hmm... 

00:38:10
DOUGLAS …Ah... They might also be part of it too. 

00:38:10
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm… Hmm... 

00:38:15
DOUGLAS Ah... 

00:38:15
MELISSA CORPUS So, it seems like you are, you're willing to ah... initiate ah... some of your feedback, even if it ah... goes against what, what they are doing, ah... Being... It seems like being two persistent ah... where there would be like negative applications, you seem to like back away ah... somewhat similar to how you relate to your parents ah... in ways that it, it seems like you, you do maintain, you know, your personal life here... 

00:38:45
DOUGLAS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:38:50
MELISSA CORPUS …and you really, you provide some of the expectations that they want but ah... only to get certain... 

00:38:55
DOUGLAS Some extent. 

00:38:55
MELISSA CORPUS ...extent. 

00:38:55
DOUGLAS Hmm... I guess so, yeah. Never saw that way before. 

00:39:00
REFLECTIVE QUESTIONS 

00:39:05
Consider discussing the following questions in small groups or supervision. • How do you understand Douglas' interpersonal style? • How might his interpersonal style come into play in their therapeutic relationship? • As a person with multiple cultural identities (e.g., gay, Vietnamese-American, male), Douglas navigates the world from numerous cultural values and personality traits. What is your impression of how he negotiates conflict in his life? • Explore how you handle conflict in your life and when working with clients. • Douglas revealed his indirect approach to communication (via narrative about his parents and the topic of dating). How might your understanding of his communication style be useful in your work with Douglas? • How does Douglas' communication style help you understand the importance of "timing" and "reframing" in therapeutic relationships? In the next segment Melissa briefly describes her understanding of Douglas' communication style. 

00:40:05
MELISSA CORPUS In some ways ah... people in your family are very responsive to indirect cues. 

00:40:10
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:40:10
MELISSA CORPUS Ah... Like when you kind of laughed it off and joke about it and say, you know, "why are you asking me that?" 

00:40:15
DOUGLAS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:40:15
MELISSA CORPUS …family members and you it seems like you are very ah... aware of that boundary and if hits you like you, you guys back off or you back off? 

00:40:25
DOUGLAS Yeah, yeah. 

00:40:25
MELISSA CORPUS Ah... So has there ever been a time where ah... they haven't respected those boundaries and... 

00:40:35
DOUGLAS Probably not. Nothing I could think of, ah... you know I think ah... because partly because of the distance that I put, you know, like living here, and having my life here, probably that opportunity to cross the kind of boundary hasn't really come up, yeah. But, ah... now I do look at like some of my other siblings, right. So... Ah... I'll go back when I was talking about holidays, so you know, if I don't wanna go home for Labor Day, I say, "Oh mom, I gonna work". 

00:41:00
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:41:00
DOUGLAS Hahaha... You know, it kind of ends there… 

00:41:05
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:41:05
DOUGLAS …where ah... my sister who is just you know, two years older than me, a little bit older, she lives in Boston and she was, she lives in Cambridge now. Ah... So she has been here for couple of years. So, you know, she can come and go as she pleases ah... and if she doesn't wanna come home, she says, "Mom, I'd rather not spent time with you this weekend. 

00:41:20
MELISSA CORPUS She'd say what? 

00:41:20
DOUGLAS She's just, she's just like, "Mom, I'd rather not, you know, come home this weekend". And that's it. Were I couldn't, I don't think I could ever say that, to so directly. 

00:41:30
MELISSA CORPUS How... How come? 

00:41:30
DOUGLAS I don't know. I think it's, I feel bad. I mean, sure if... Ah... Yeah I think I just feel bad saying that to my mom I don't wanna see you right now. Hahaha… It's yeah. 

00:41:40
MELISSA CORPUS So what do you forsee her ah... feeling like or reacting… 

00:41:45
DOUGLAS If I said that? 

00:41:45
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah. 

00:41:45
DOUGLAS Honestly probably the same reaction as me saying, "Oh I have to work this weekend. I can't come home for the long holiday." It's just so much easier to say, "Oh, you know… 

00:41:55
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:41:55
DOUGLAS I've got to, I've got to work," as opposed to, you know, I don't wanna spend... I wanna have a weekend in the city with my friends, you know, and my boyfriend and things like that. So... 

00:42:05
MELISSA CORPUS So it seems like when it's, I mean an issue of like work… 

00:42:05
DOUGLAS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:42:10
MELISSA CORPUS ...or with school like you mentioned before… 

00:42:10
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:42:10
MELISSA CORPUS …that you've decided to go away for school ah... that they do seem to respect those boundaries and you somewhat indirectly communicated to them. 

00:42:20
DOUGLAS Right, right. And I think it's like a, you know, there are also certain things that are just things you can sacrifice for, you know, so it's... Ah... You know if I wanted to move to Paris for six months and just not- kind of eke a living up there, but basically moved there to live there… 

00:42:35
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:42:35
DOUGLAS …that would not really be of great value, right, but you know making sacrifices, in terms of for a job or for school are things that, ah... you know, they'll take well. So, they're not gonna judge me, for example if I sacrifice XYZ or a school or for a job, that if I sacrifice and if I decided just to, you know, take six months off or year off… 

00:43:00
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:43:00
DOUGLAS …I need to travel, even on my dime, they would challenge that… 

00:43:05
MELISSA CORPUS Umm... 

00:43:05
DOUGLAS Ah... 

00:43:05
MELISSA CORPUS So, how do you think they will judge you if you did, did propose ah... that you moved to Paris just to get the experience… 

00:43:10
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:43:15
MELISSA CORPUS ...of living in Paris. 

00:43:15
DOUGLAS You know, they'd question. I mean, you know, they would question you why I was doing it, how it would impact kind of my career path, basically like that, I mean, in general they'll be supportive, but I guess it's like, you know, going to a small scale for example, like Labor Day weekend, right. So, I don't wanna go back there because I have some plans, ah... but I also decide to spend a long holiday… 

00:43:35
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:43:35
DOUGLAS …here in city. Ah... I blamed it on work when I them that I couldn't come, ah... but if I decide, oh I was barbeque, I've to go to… 

00:43:40
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:43:40
DOUGLAS …or to my friend's house ah... and I haven't seen them in a while. They probably would't argue with it… 

00:43:50
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:43:50
DOUGLAS …but it'd probably get a little bit harder… 

00:43:50
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... 

00:43:50
DOUGLAS …to them, then me saying, "Oh I have to work this weekend". So... 

00:43:55
MELISSA CORPUS So you're very protective with their, their feelings? 

00:43:55
DOUGLAS Sure. Yeah, I guess I am. Yeah. 

00:44:05
THE CLIENT'S IMPRESSION OF THE SESSION Douglas describes his experiences with Melissa, what he could have benefitted from and how he would try to get his needs met. As you listen to Douglas, consider the information he shared in his work with Melissa as well as the messages he conveyed verbally and non-verbally. 

00:44:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Douglas, thank you so much for participating in the video today. It has been very good to know you over the last few sessions. Ah... I'm wondering before I began supervision with Melissa can you tell me a little bit about what the experience is like, working with her. 

00:44:55
DOUGLAS Ah... I think she was good. I think she listened. Ah... I think she was, she got what I was saying, ah... she was responsive, I think to what I was saying. Ah... I think if there is anything I would have liked to see differently, I think I would have, I feel like I was kind of going from really deep into one direction and then really deep to another ah... You know, I think in, in my past, I'm trying to think in my past experience of counseling ah... it was personal counseling, but if I ever talked with my job, maybe it's, it seemed better at the time. Ah... So, I think, it would have helped me kind of be a little bit ah...to get more out of it if ah... these two parts of my life were talked about in a more integrated way, but I have to say that ah... she was really good that kind of making the connection at the end of it. Ah... So, even though there was a time I felt like I was going off this one avenue,and getting away from, what I thought I should be talking about, she brought it back and actually helped me get number of issues I haven't thought about before, smaller ones, but ones that were new to me. So, ah... I enjoyed the session. 

00:46:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Great. So, let me ask you another question. Earlier when we spoke to you, we talked a little bit about what you would like to get out of therapy and who you percieve to be your ideal therapist... 

00:46:15
DOUGLAS Hmm hmm. 

00:46:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Ah... I am wondering, if ah... you were to continue a therapy, what might you do definitely, as a client to get some of your needs meant? 

00:46:30
DOUGLAS I mean, I think if we ended up, if I ended up building a therapy relationship with Melissa, I probably would have asked her to ah... challenge me a little bit more. So, I think she was really good at synthesizing, and, and kind of putting pieces together for me. Ah... But I think, I guess, I, it's really easy for me to talk on for like five hours, about nothing and everything at the same time or just one thing, I think, ah... yeah it's a kind of a more ah... yeah more push back in a way and kind of coping more I think helps me because I often. I’ve thought, I said when that she was gonna talking especially in this kind of context. I get into a loop where I'd like to reiterate or just say something the same thing over and over again. Ah... It’s my that’s myself, you know. 

00:47:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Great, Ah... Thank you for sharing. I’m actually wondering if I challenge you with the next question. 

00:47:25
DOUGLAS Sure. 

00:47:25
ANIKA K. WARREN I had an opportunity to listen to the videotape or watching it earlier and I'm going to meet with Melissa for supervision later today. One of things I observed in your work with her as well as when I met with you a few years ago is that there was a tendency to kind of over explain and give a lot of detailed and nuances as you said get into this slew of information and as I was listening to the videotape one of the questions that struck with, struck me was, is he really ready to move or how much of this talking and explaining is really about kind of how he functions in the world or had he resisted some opportunity to grow? And I just was wondering what was your reaction… what's your reaction to me thinking that and then what would your reaction be for working with someone in counseling? 

00:48:10
DOUGLAS Yeah. And I think you’re on point. It's not... It’s not that easy to hear of course, but I’m, I totally agree because I think I’ve caught myself in... on that kind of stuff before. Ah... I think that, yeah getting more prospect and you know, none as your negative prospect or prospect from a counselor would help to keep me more grounded like I think two, I mean especially in a, in this kind counseling there are professional development and management and supervision. Ah... I feel like we, we get into these things when we are or I kind of script to where I talked about my work ah... and it's, it should be less about the information ah... and I guess more about kind of how I’m feeling about it. Ah... I mean, that was the feedback after my therapist when I tried to compare to her, people saying the same story over and over again but we talked get to really pushing me to kind of say what does that really mean and kind of all that. 

00:49:10
Supervision is an excellent way to learn multicultural counseling skills and strategies to embrace complexities that come will all clients. However, research suggests that most supervisors are not prepared to train their supervisees on how to become a culturally competent counselor. Effective supervision requires that both supervisors and supervisees remain open to learning and listening to one another when discussing clients and the supervisory relationship. As a counselor-in-training, it is important for you to know your strengths, growth edges, goals and counseling approaches and to find ways to integrate them into your supervisory relationship. MULTICULTURAL SUPERVISION: A Collaborative and Candid Discussion About Cultural Sensitivity In the following chapter, Melissa and Dr. Warren have an informal and impromptu supervision session. By sharing their impression of the session and discussing potential ways of working with Douglas, Melissa and Dr. Warren use their knowledge about multicultural counseling competence, theoretical orientations, and clinical strategies to brainstorm about how to work effectively with Douglas. They also provide analysis on Melissa’s work with Douglas. 

00:50:55
ANIKA K. WARREN Hey Melissa. It's good sit with you. I had a chance to look at the video that you did with Douglas Stan couple of hour, it was an excellent session as far as getting to know him and establishing rapport and determining kind of what is he coming in with. What is the experience since he’s been in counseling four years ago and when does he like seems of doing next book as a professional as a person in counseling and as a kind of personal level. So, like that you did a really nice job. And I really liked the way that you were warm and empathic and you established a really nice rapport with him. I wanted to spend sometime. I've jotted down a few thoughts and reactions that I want to share with you. But before we begin I wanted to see what you thought this session was like? 

00:51:40
MELISSA CORPUS I felt very comfortable with him. You know I felt good in terms of trying to gather some like initial background information. You know, one thing that I think jumps out at me is that I could, I could've gathered more information about his emotional response to some of his experiences. He’s ah... I think he’s, he presents his way like articulate and very aware of like his experiences and his perspective, which sometimes it's comes out like intellectualized and I think I got, I engaged in that without like kind of reacting to his emotional response. You know, I felt like I wasn’t being like aware about, yeah, about his that kind of experience. 

00:52:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Hmm... Hmm... 

00:52:35
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah. 

00:52:40
ANIKA K. WARREN I think it’s a great point you're making, because I think he also, I spoke to him afterwards, I think he also mentioned, you know some of his own experiences of how he functions in the world and he’s describing exactly what you described. I do think you did a good job of giving him some emotions in, since this was your first time meeting with him on some level I think that that is okay… 

00:53:00
MELISSA CORPUS Right, yeah. 

00:53:00
ANIKA K. WARREN …and I don’t want you to be too self-critical. It was a great first session and you can’t do everything in the first time you meet someone anyway. But with regards to slowing him down and having him pause and having him sit with what he’s saying, I think that that would be really really good. I just wonder, for you, like what do you think that might have been like doing those things with him and keeping within the cultural context you as a woman and him as a man... 

00:53:30
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:53:30
ANIKA K. WARREN …both as Asians and there were context you wanna use. But what do you think it’ll be like for you to slow him down a little bit, to pause, to challenge him on some of those feelings that he seemed to little bit engaged with? 

00:53:45
MELISSA CORPUS Ah... No, if think about it, ah... I think it would have definitely been useful to obviously slow down and sit with it. Ah... I think... I think that also, and I think it might have provoked anxiety from me and it might have for him too, because I think I got the sense of, I was flowing with, with his ah... momentum. 

00:54:10
ANIKA K. WARREN Hmm... 

00:54:10
MELISSA CORPUS You know, I felt like I was just going with his momentum in terms of ah... you know he’s, he’s very like kind of, even though there are some conflicts he’s very concrete about his conflicts. 

00:54:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Hmm... Hmm... 

00:54:20
MELISSA CORPUS So ah... you can tell that he's thought about things a lot about, you know, you know what he’s grabbling with A or B or integrating it… 

00:54:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Hmm... Hmm... 

00:54:30
MELISSA CORPUS …ah... that to kind of sit with it and challenge, challenge him on certain things I think, I think that would have ah... Yeah I think it, it would have been a little bit anxiety provoking ah... I think on both ends ah... Because I feel in so... in some ways ah... for me, for my style, I think it would have, he would have also felt a little bit too challenging for the first initial ah... session, because ah... you know not really I’d like to just kind of like sit and listen to how ah... to their nerve, so ah... Yeah I, I… 

00:55:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Yeah. 

00:55:15
MELISSA CORPUS …I... I feel mixed, kind of mixed about it, yeah. 

00:55:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Yeah, I agree with you. I think that one thing that I like to do in supervision is work with people where they are actually comfortable in, you know, how do I use myself as an instrument? And how you use yourself as an instrument clinically in doing what you think is most appropriate? So, I think that's a great call. And there was a point in the tape where you asked him about being uncomfortable or discomfort, I wrote it down. Ah… You see... You asked him about with regards that his family, and I just wrote down, what’s been comfortable with your family and what around some, you were talking a little bit about expectations. 

00:56:00
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:56:00
ANIKA K. WARREN And what I noticed is that he had some non-verbals that were very different than the rest of the tape where he was kind of pulling back his face kind of changed… 

00:56:10
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

00:56:10
ANIKA K. WARREN …and I... I don’t know if you were conscious of that in the moment or unconscious about but you did respond in a way where you were able to just give him enough to share and get to know you but not to make him uncomfortable and at any other point of the session. So, I think on some way that was working to your favor, that, that, that reaction. Ah... And I also think maybe there’s some cultural pieces of that as well as far as how comfortable you two might have been with challenging, connecting and establishing a certain type of rapport. And I, I think as you suggested earlier in sessions it’s better to air on the safe side of not doing too much or pushing anyone. But I’m wondering if you were gonna work with him going forward are there any ways that you might consider working in a way that will be a little challenging or pushing. Maybe… 

00:56:55
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah, definitely. 

00:56:55
ANIKA K. WARREN …session five session ten like if you were to have a bit of a relationship? 

00:57:00
MELISSA CORPUS Definitely. I think ah... I think one thing that I wanna highlight is ah... there’s a, there’s a lot of like kind of the ambiguous kind of terms or feelings around things and I, I think I would ah... again like a lot of intellect… intellectualization. So, I think I would definitely challenge ah... him on working on like labeling some of the emotions around it. Ah... And kind of exploring ah... his tendency to ah... talk about his experiences as more like factual concrete things ah... I supposed to ah... you know his, his affective, the affective part of it. Ah... So, yeah, I would, I would be more challenging in, in that aspects ah... and understand like the cultural ah... values around ah... expressing your emotions to the man, expressing your emotions ah... as an Asian-American man ah... and ah... gather more information on how emotions were expressed at his family. Ah... And the feelings around that, the comfort level around that 'cause ah... There’s... There’s a lot of like indirect communication within his family... 

00:58:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Hmm... Hmm... 

00:58:25
MELISSA CORPUS ...but ah... he presents his way like direct in some ways ah… 

00:58:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... 

00:58:30
MELISSA CORPUS …that is his, his contradictory to the style of the family. 

00:58:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Hmm... 

00:58:35
MELISSA CORPUS Because I… I… I envisioned him a very like direct work even though there are some boundaries around that… 

00:58:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Hmm... Hmm... 

00:58:40
MELISSA CORPUS …ah... as he’s mentioned of ah... not pushing too much, but there’s a part of him that is, is an initiator ah... in terms of whether it’s his long term goals or like making waves with ah... you know, like doing community work ah... 'cause, 'cause that’s like, that’s pushing peoples, it's like, it's very like pushing… 

00:59:00
ANIKA K. WARREN Hmm... Hmm... 

00:59:00
MELISSA CORPUS …peoples boundaries, it's very like ah... there’s an activist own into that ah... an activist, I don’t, I don’t see his like in foreigners. So, ah... I see like two sides of him… 

00:59:10
ANIKA K. WARREN Hmm... Hmm... 

00:59:10
MELISSA CORPUS …and maybe like working on ah... exploring like, if he'd want to integrate that aspect of him that seems he seems to be really passionate about integrating into like inter-personal relationships and how ah... you know, maybe that might have benefited him not to suggest that he should come up to his family or come up with… 

00:59:35
ANIKA K. WARREN …with his parents, yeah. 

00:59:35
MELISSA CORPUS …his parents ah... but just, just in other ways of… 

00:59:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Yeah. So, a few things that you said really resonated with what I remember in having worked with you in the past with regards to the clients or students you’ve seen is, there are few things. But one of 'em was where you talked about the duality of having functions. I think ah... it’s kind of multi-contextual or multi-complex with regards to, there are many facets of his life that don’t seem to gel like this cultural component this cultural maleness, gayness, Asianess. 

01:00:05
MELISSA CORPUS Right. 

01:00:10
ANIKA K. WARREN And ah... I think one other things that I was struck by is he doesn’t love storytelling and sometimes the stories are more focused on the other people, then on himself like what… how has this affected you? You talked about crisis in your family how has that affected you. And I know you talked about potentially challenging him going forward. And I think one approach into getting him comfortable with that is figuring up how he, when has he felt challenged in the past? How has he dealt with challenges in the past? Ah... And what, try to engage that comfort level for him by describing interactions, by using some narrative therapy approaches or ah... having him do some reflexivity on what’s happened, ah... just to increase his awareness and really to ask some questions that help you figure out what is my best strategy... 

01:00:55
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah. 

01:00:55
MELISSA CORPUS ...for pushing him and challenging him, and how much do I think he can tolerate based upon what he’s saying verbally and non-verbally. 

01:01:05
MELISSA CORPUS Right, right. 

01:01:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Ah... I think you also suggested that ah... you know, he had a good idea of who he was in your words, and I experienced him as very insightful too when he said that that’s good and at some point you’d even want to kind of shake up how he saw himself too much… 

01:01:20
MELISSA CORPUS Right. 

01:01:20
ANIKA K. WARREN …and I think that's right on, but I also felt like it was pretty fixed in definitive like this is kind of how I function and I think it’ll be a great opportunity within the context of his comfort level and yours to have him explore or who else would you be? And what else did you feel? And what else did you think? To really help it kind of unfold… 

01:01:40
MELISSA CORPUS Expand. 

01:01:40
ANIKA K. WARREN …or unpack or expand like there was a lot more in all those stories. Ah... Another thing I know we talked a lot in supervision and counseling when we’re talking about the clinical session around resistance and I'm wondering about his longer explanations and his discussions and descriptions. I think one way that’s how he connects and draws people in which is a great strength for him that I would highlight. But I think also in someway that does a diservice, for him because he does kind to get lost and he gives a lot of detail, ah... and sometimes targeting the richness ‘cause I, I, I thought you had some great questions at the end around what’s next for you or what do you see this or is there anything you want to focus on? And then the response will be three minutes or so long that you're like, like okay so can we make this a little bit more concrete, a little bit more tangible, ‘cause the insights and explorations go on and on but then have been some word association or some keywords or some, if this then what? 

01:02:40
MELISSA CORPUS Right, right. 

01:02:40
ANIKA K. WARREN So, how does that sound? 

01:02:40
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah, I mean, I think ah... that’s a good strategy and starting to work, work with him in terms of ah... kind of gaining comfortability with and it sounds like an aspect that reflects that ah... he hasn’t really explored in terms of ah... maybe outwardly expressing emotions you know, who's to say that he has an ah... you know, like journaled about it or explored that internally but in terms of outward ah... expression of it ah... I think those are good strategies. Ah... Also I thought of, in terms of the details that you’re talking about, trying to link the behavior and how the behavior tells, tells a story in terms of how, how he’s feeling and trying to kind of link that back in, into ah... in the beginning like one specific incident keeping it short and ah... really looking at that and thinking about like, okay how does that make ah... how did he experience that, what feelings came up for him ah... and just it really staying on the ah... like you know, staying here now. Right, yeah. 

01:03:50
ANIKA K. WARREN Yeah keeping it concrete. 

01:03:50
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah, keeping it, like keeping his feelings or else anything you are now so ah... yeah, you know I think, I think I could really use some of those strategies that you're... 

01:04:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Yeah. 

01:04:05
MELISSA CORPUS …you’re thinking about. 

01:04:05
ANIKA K. WARREN I... I think one of the things that also struck me as you were speaking is ah... if this is how we perceive him, how does he think that he’s perceived in the workplace? Meaning, one thing I’m curious about, as he moves forward ah... and he was talking about, kind of here are some of the interactions so I experienced them, this is challenge ah... to get it, his perspective of how, how he’s working. So whether that’s having him do some self-assessments having him bring a performance review in, having him do some benchmarking or querying or questioning, because he does come across as were you put together and organize and thought out, and not as much of a feeling person. And as a man and as an Asian, those are stereotypes of kind of how he’s expected to engage in the world about saving face. But I’m wondering how that might affect him as far as his career growth, his interest in urban planning? Ah... How does his, how he sees himself versus how the world sees him? So, having him do some work around that, having him test some perceptions and not just professional but also social and then familiar. This is how you seek yourself, how do you think other people connect with you or understand you in the world? And how do you think you might need to modify that... 

01:05:25
MELISSA CORPUS Right. 

01:05:30
ANIKA K. WARREN …to, to get some of your own needs met whether they are collective needs or individual needs? 

01:05:30
MELISSA CORPUS Right, right. 

01:05:35
ANIKA K. WARREN So, I think that using some of things you observed as ways to get him to think about his life in different ways or come up with different approaches could be very very helpful. Ah... When it comes to getting that work done, I think it’s also important to think some of the theoretical orientations that might be fitting for this client. 

01:05:55
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah. 

01:05:55
ANIKA K. WARREN So, I’m gonna ask that we should gear just a little bit, keeping Douglas and your work with him in mind, ah... and what we know about him, I know you’ve seen my work with him ah... and I’ve seen your with him. And I’m wondering what theoretical orientations do you think might be really appropriate with the client like Douglas who is as we just described him with all those attributes? 

01:06:20
MELISSA CORPUS Ah... I think ah... one think would be person-centered where I'd allow him to, I mean obviously he shares his, his narratives about it and give him ah... I like the client to feel empowered in their narratives and also it ah... it’s not um… 

01:06:40
ANIKA K. WARREN It's okay... 

01:06:40
MELISSA CORPUS Well I would say person-centered ah... I would also say ah... I mean, I look at things dynamically too so ah... from, from ah... his ah... how he, how he kind of looks at his relationships in terms of all the conflict ah... I would, I would like to get, get more background ah... in terms of how his family had conflicts and what did it look like, how they resolved it ah... ‘cause it seems like a very, an area that's is very avoiding around ah... and what that would mean for him that, if he did ah... kind of initiate ah... something that is more adversarial than, than normal, so ah... yeah, so psychodynamic person-centered ah... and you know, that’s, that’s mainly, mainly in terms… (crosstalk) ...yeah in terms of ah... trying to ah... be multiculturally sensitive to ah... kind of his experience, his experience as a gay male and his experience as a gay Asian male ah... just honoring ah... how, how he views it and challenging him in a way that’s respectable ah... by kind of giving other ah... perspectives and how to look at it. Ah... As you mentioned before in terms of how does he perceive himself, how do other people perceive himself or him and so, you know. 

01:08:10
ANIKA K. WARREN I think that’s great. I liked the notion of honoring who he is and what he wants in the world and I just wanted to highlight that while we’re saying give his understandings of others perceptions of him and helping him figure out what others perceptions are, it’s not necessarily to modify who he is, but it’s to really help him build strategies whether it's coping strategies. professional development strategies... 

01:08:30
MELISSA CORPUS Right. 

01:08:35
ANIKA K. WARREN ...so it’s not about changing him… 

01:08:35
MELISSA CORPUS Right. 

01:08:35
ANIKA K. WARREN …but helping him look at new nuances of his world, he got, okay so how do you wanna negotiate these things better? 

01:08:40
MELISSA CORPUS Right… 

01:08:40
ANIKA K. WARREN I think the approach is, I think person-centered and psychodynamic or excellent. So, you're really describing an integrative approach with the multicultural lens the honoring, the respecting, the getting to know, the being authentic. Ah... I think also person-centered is a nice was to really tap into some of those feelings. I think there are some other things you might try with him are some of the more creative approaches, not just having him do some narrative therapy ah... where he may do some storytelling and you might ask him to revamp a story or share how this outcome occurred and how about you modify the outcomes and things of that nature. But I think really dipping and dabbling and integrating so once you get into kind of putting him up in the workplace and trying out some of the therapeutic work is were kind of homework assignments, were kind of CBT, were kind of components can I integrate into how I’m working with him so it’s more effective it would be very good? Ah... Also getting an understanding of how he sees himself outside of work, outside of family and outside of social? How does he engage in a world as an individual, not from a individualistic versus collectivistic? What does he enjoy doing? Listening to music watching movies... 

01:09:50
MELISSA CORPUS Right. 

01:09:55
ANIKA K. WARREN …interacting with friends, particular type of music, hiking, bike riding? Getting to know who he is what resonates with him as an individual and how does he connect with that in helping him build coping strategies that are more harmonious and also honoring him would be… 

01:10:10
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah.. 

01:10:10
ANIKA K. WARREN ...a better approach? And I think often when we talk about multicultural counseling and what strategy, what theory, what’s your own bias, what are your own substance. I think there are critical questions to ask at all times. They’re very critical, but ah... I think there is also this part of getting to know the person in their own skin and how they engage in the world and how they live. And trying to figure how can I use this to help him? 

01:10:35
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah. I, I agree I think ah... I think there’s a way to integrate like CBT orientation in a very multiculturally sensitive way where you’re saying ah... gathering more information about ah... his background and his experiences and kind of ah... utilizing that from his lens and kind of finding out ah... developing strategies and therapying in terms of, okay what can you do when you have ah... you know, a kind of confrontation with your boss or co-worker? Ah... What are the things that are comfortable for him? What are other ways, you know offer other ways to ah... kind of resolve issues or confront someone ah... you know whether it’s in a work-setting or in a family, family-setting I felt like that came up a lot in terms of like even, even though the things like you know when his parents asked him if he's coming home for a Labor Day. 

01:11:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Yeah. 

01:11:35
MELISSA CORPUS Ah... Even that little interaction can, I felt like says a lot about ah... the communications are within the family and I felt like that translated into somewhat into his, his work life… 

01:11:45
ANIKA K. WARREN Hmm... Hmm... 

01:11:45
MELISSA CORPUS Ah... I thought if presented differently but ah... kind of gaining new skills in therapy in terms of ah... what he can do that is most appropriate for him in empowering him in, in that way. 

01:12:00
ANIKA K. WARREN Yeah, and when you say appropriate for him you really mean within his world… 

01:12:00
MELISSA CORPUS Right. 

01:12:00
ANIKA K. WARREN …and he… Right. So I just wanna make sure I understand that. I think that’s right on, I think great insights. I was, as you were saying it, I was thinking there was a few things that you might try doing, one is helping him get in touch with his feelings more so not just talking about them or living them… 

01:12:20
MELISSA CORPUS Umm... Umm... 

01:12:20
ANIKA K. WARREN …or sharing stories ah... and you could do that by you know, we’ll find out, you know does he journal, does he reflect, does he listen to music ah... what are ways that you could do it if he, does he like taking pictures, is he into art or photography… 

01:12:30
MELISSA CORPUS Umm... Umm... 

01:12:35
ANIKA K. WARREN …just a range of things, how does he sit with his emotions, in the moments, some existential work like in the here and now. 

01:12:40
MELISSA CORPUS Okay. 

01:12:40
ANIKA K. WARREN When you're with your parents ah... and what feelings, what reactions, what's happening for you or let’s do some of that right now together in this session would be one way. Ah... In some of my work around our therapy one thing I would ask clients who had difficulty to either expressing or connecting with their feelings who were into a certain type of music, bring in a song, bring in a CD, let's listen to it together and, and it gives you insight. 

01:13:05
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah, yeah! 

01:13:05
ANIKA K. WARREN You process the words, you process the melody and music and reaction when he listens to it, things of that nature. So really thinking about what’s appropriate for him and what’s comfortable for you. I know that you’re also very into music and you can connect in and be really authentic with him and I know he’s looking for that kind of authenticity ‘cause he shared that. Ah... And he’s also looking for those strategies. So, as I said I think the first session was very strong. I think we can look at the tape and, and think about ah... how it could improve and everything. But ultimately think you did a good job of drawing in some themes. You gave him a lot of space early on to share himself and you for you to kind of take it all then for you to get to know him. So, I thought that that was exceptional. And then kind of pulling it in and asking some questions about next steps and what you’ve observed and I think it was really good for that first session. I think what I’d like you to do is ah... sit with some of what we talked about and kind of start charting out what were the treatment plan, what are some session questions, what are some, what do I hear as his presenting concerns even if it’s just to have someone as a sounding board, or what do I hear is potential next steps that I want to check in with him on it. But before we end I just wanted to ask you a little bit about what do you think your kind of, your own kind of biases, expectations or assumptions? How do you think you might get in the way of the work? 

01:14:35
MELISSA CORPUS Ah... Yeah, it's interesting because I actually have not had very many experiences with another Asian client... 

01:14:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Really? 

01:14:40
MELISSA CORPUS So, ah... you know, when, when he talks about some of values I shared some of the same values but ah... you know, part of me also wanted to clarify that to, to make sure you know how, how he defined his values ah... is what I’m thinking on it… 

01:15:00
ANIKA K. WARREN Right. 

01:15:00
MELISSA CORPUS …or if there is something totally different. So, ah... I think ah... if anything I felt like it, you know, I feel like I’m gonna have to actually work harder in terms of ah... making sure that I’m, I’m not assuming things and to really ask him to clarify things. Ah... And secondly I, I really don’t know how he feels about like interacting with other. Hahaha... with other Asian to having an Asian therapist. So, ah... I don’t know if it’s more difficult for him, you know, to express some of ah... his concerns about ah... saying that he’s feeling selfish or, you know, maybe he might have assumptions about me thinking that I’m judging him for being selfish ah... as he perceives himself some, at times. Ah... So, ah... it was an interesting experience for me, because yeah I, I rarely have ah... Hahaha… like ah an Asian client so ah... but it was it was nice it’s a nice ah... ‘cause it reminds me that I can’t… can’t really assume and how ah... I really do have that probe more. 

01:16:10
ANIKA K. WARREN I’m glad you brought that up. Ah... You know, supervising you on a go over too many topics or shift you too many times, but I think that it is pretty loaded you know what is being spoken and what is unspoken about the interaction around both being Asian and also the male/female component… 

01:16:30
MELISSA CORPUS Right, right. 

01:16:30
ANIKA K. WARREN …then, then how is that hierarchy and I think there are ways to also get to that without being direct. Ah... I don’t know in some ways I see him as being very direct in his… 

01:16:40
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm… 

01:16:40
ANIKA K. WARREN …style and approach and then in other ways I see him as really indirect in how he kind of functions in, okay, so this is what I’m gonna do to meet everyone’s needs. 

01:16:45
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

01:16:45
ANIKA K. WARREN …is I’m going to get in the middle of it all. 

01:16:50
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

01:16:50
ANIKA K. WARREN Ah... So, for you figure out what that dance is as the counselor, to be direct on certain topics and indirect in your style in other topics right. Ah... And one way to get an understanding of this Asian values, I know there is tons of ways but when you were speaking I was curious about ah... what are his interactions with different siblings, older or younger brothers and sisters. So, you can kind of receive the gender component of it. 

01:17:15
MELISSA CORPUS Hmm... Hmm... 

01:17:15
ANIKA K. WARREN What are his interactions ah... with his parents, so you can get the hierarchy… 

01:17:20
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah. 

01:17:20
ANIKA K. WARREN …relationship with his mom, and his father. While we'll never really know kind of how he engages others that are Asian or non-Asian and male versus female or how he perceives you. You can start to kind of hypothesize based upon how he functions in the world with regards to the authority features, people of the same gender or the same sex the same sexual orientations social class and all of that, by getting some more background information or asking him to talk about past challenges or experiencing in learning how he’s negotiating those. Ah... There were some few other things that I wanted to talk about today. And I'm just gonna check in and you, you mentioned this earlier but I did when I was watching the tape, I did write down some things like he referred to kind of, it's weird or the two value systems and, and you know two value systems as a gender being or Asian being, ethnic being ah... sexual orientation… 

01:18:20
MELISSA CORPUS Right. 

01:18:20
ANIKA K. WARREN ...or professional versus… 

01:18:20
MELISSA CORPUS Right. 

01:18:20
ANIKA K. WARREN …social value systems, I think that there are so many value systems that he functions within… 

01:18:25
MELISSA CORPUS Right. 

01:18:25
ANIKA K. WARREN …even to Boston versus New York. 

01:18:30
MELISSA CORPUS Right, right. 

01:18:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Ah... So, I think that that was a place that could be explored further moving forward and I think he could be exploring within the context and how he sees himself, how he negotiates, how he wants to cope better going forward. Ah... And to figure out how many value systems are they and which ones does he lean towards. And I mean that could take two to three sessions in itself... 

01:18:50
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah. 

01:18:50
ANIKA K. WARREN ...that one topic. So I, I don’t want to overload you. I think one thing I like to do in supervision is to touch on a lot of different directions one can go in. Brainstorm about how to move in those different directions. And then figure out how much you wanna follow the clients need in the next section or direct it. But regardless of what ways he might go you’ve got a little bit of here little bit of there a lot of different ways… 

01:19:15
MELISSA CORPUS Right, right. 

01:19:15
ANIKA K. WARREN …you can use what he’s, what he’s bringing in. But that was another piece that I thought. And I think for me what was really key is how complex he is as far as… 

01:19:25
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah. 

01:19:25
ANIKA K. WARREN …his multiple identities as far as his reference groups as you know ah... speaking on multicultural issues ah… 

01:19:35
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah, now I think your touching on a point of just how complex his identities are which come along with how complex the value systems are which is also you could see in his life of just like other different conflicts that he has but he experiences it. It’s not really cut and dry ah... it’s, there's a lot of variables that ah... It seems like he considers so… 

01:20:00
ANIKA K. WARREN Yeah, I think that you hold all that multiculturalism, you hold out the client's stuff meaning the content they bring into the session and then you still have to go back to psychological well being. How do we engage him? Is he someone we need to diagnose? How do we diagnose him? What do we say his GAF is? What is his GAF? And then from a mental health perspective, how can we help him? Coz he seems like a relatively high functioning client, high functioning person. How can we help him grow? Or How can we help him learn? How can we help him get his needs met more effectively. So you have to still bring all that in the middle… 

01:20:35
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah 

01:20:35
ANIKA K. WARREN …dealing with psychological stuff. 

01:20:35
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah, yeah. 

01:20:35
ANIKA K. WARREN But given that I haven't worked with him that much and you haven’t either. We haven't really got into do a deep dive on with where his feelings coming, where his thought patterns coming from, what is his general way of engaging in the world from a kind of psychoanalytic or psychodynamic historical perspective. So is there anything that you need from me that you think might be helpful? 

01:21:00
MELISSA CORPUS No um, it's you know that seemed very helpful and really thorough. Yeah, thank you.

An integrative approach to counseling and supervision can increase a counselor’s ability to apply multiple strategies in culturally sensitive and critically appropriate ways. Dr. Warren and Melissa give examples of how Person Centered Therapy, Psychodynamic Approaches, Multicultural Counseling Competencies, Narrative Therapy, and Cognitive Behavior Therapy might facilitate Douglas’ clinical work. When working with the clients in a multicultural counseling context, some counselors who are early in their training might want to quickly highlight some of "contradictions" that are shared. However, it is important to consider the various impacts of how a client living in multiple cultural contexts might negotiate their relationships without assuming that the client has not adjusted or adapted to either lifestyle (e.g., inherent therapeutic biases about empowerment and individuation or the assumption that LBGT clients need to "come out" and want to focus on their sexual orientation.) Explore your own expectations and assumptions about what a treatment plan would look like for Douglas. How many different ways of being or negotiating interpersonal relationships can you come up with that are culturally appropriate and sensitive for Douglas? Explore some of the racial, gender, sexual orientation and social class dynamics that could come to play. Consider using the Cultural Context Assessment by Cary and Marques to facilitate your supervisory relationship. Examples of Collectivistic Orientations among some Asian Cultures (Sue & Sue): Instead of promoting individual needs and personal identity, Asian families tend to have a family and group orientation. Children are expected to strive for family goals and not to engage in behaviors that would bring dishonor to the family. Asian-American parents tend to show little interest in a child’s viewpoint regarding family matters. Examples of Collectivistic Orientations among some Asian Cultures (Sue & Sue): Because of a possible collectivistic orientation, it is important to consider the family and community context during assessment and problem definition. Do not automatically consider interdependence as a sign of enmeshment. To assess the degree of collectivism and acculturation, one might ask a client about how important family is in his/her decision making. Examples of Collectivistic Orientations among some Asian Cultures (Sue & Sue): Sue & Sue suggest that counselors recognize how hierarchical relationships within different cultures influence the clinical relationship. For example, traditional Asian American families tend to be hierarchical and patriarchal in structure, with males and older individuals occupying a higher status. As a result, communication flows down from parent to child in ways where the child (even as an adult) is expected to defer to their parent and sons are excepted to carry on the family name and tradition. Examples of Collectivistic Orientations among some Asian Cultures (Sue & Sue): Sue & Sue acknowledge that differences across and within cultures do exist and that counselors must use knowledge, skills, and awareness when working with clients from any cultural group. MULTICULTURAL SUPERVISION: A Final Check-in Before Closing Supervision 

01:24:25
ANIKA K. WARREN So, as we close supervision, I just want to check-in as your supervisor and find out is there anything that you might want to work on going forward? Or do you have feedback for me with regards to how I can more useful and helpful to you in your development? 

01:24:40
MELISSA CORPUS Um, you know just get, getting guidance, um for the future sessions in terms of, um how to, how to really to a kind of help him to like be, be more expressive in terms of or being in touch with his emotions. I think um, it’ll be helpful for me to, to have like check-ins with that in terms of um, in terms of that. Because I, I, I felt again like that with the first session with him, um I, I got caught up in the, um in the stories and intellectualization, so um I know that was the first session, but, um like being more cognizant of that. Um, I like to, I think I’ll be helpful to, in supervision. 

01:25:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Well, I will say, you know part of establishing rapport when you first get know someone is taking up the face value and going on the ride. 

01:25:35
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah, yeah. 

01:25:35
ANIKA K. WARREN You know, so I think for the next few sessions with him that is part of the journey as can't do too much… 

01:25:45
MELISSA CORPUS Right, yeah. 

01:25:45
ANIKA K. WARREN So, I think you’re right on target with that, but I definitely agree with you as you progress in your word with him to, um not necessarily stay on the same ride. 

01:25:55
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah. 

01:25:55
ANIKA K. WARREN But I think that it was a very appropriate session. And I really want you to sit with kind of the clients work, look at some of the theories we talked about and think about what type of supervision you've had in the past that’s worked for you, that hasn’t worked. And I want to welcome you to share that with me. And to as you move forward challenge my suggestions, challenge questions or ask specifically for this is what I’m looking for today or can you help me with this. I’m very open to that, so I think it's important for me to get feedback from you and for us to have a strong collaborative relationship, um which mean you can tell me, you know slow down. I wanna focus on this topic or I wanna sit with this part of the session. 

01:26:40
MELISSA CORPUS Yeah. 

01:26:40
ANIKA K. WARREN That I have with the client for 30 minutes or this I really struggle with this. Let's-can we focus on that for a couple of weeks. Or developmentally this is where I am and I wanna kind of drill down this theory or this theoretical orientation a little tighter. Or I want whatever. Okay? 

01:26:55
MELISSA CORPUS Okay. 

01:26:55
ANIKA K. WARREN So, alright? So I'll talk with you soon? 

01:27:00
MELISSA CORPUS Okay. 

01:27:00
ANIKA K. WARREN Sounds good.

Dr. Thomas A. Parham suggests using the following strategies and approaches for “raising the bar” for what passes as competence. Parham developed the following skills for working with people of African descent. They have been modified by Dr. Warren and are written so that clients, counselor, and supervisors from all backgrounds can consider using them: STRATEGY 1: Connecting with the clients/supervisees skills and cultural values: 1. Using rituals such as handshakes, libations, music, poetry, metaphors, and storytelling. 2. Exhibiting realness by discussing popular issues when relevant and appropriate, creating an ambiance that is safe and comfortable, and self-disclosing enough so that you client or supervisor/supervisee feels connected to you. 3. Shifting context and settings for your work by talking a walk, being in the community or going to the park. STRATEGY 2: Assessing your own clinical: 1. Understanding your cultural strenghts.2. Recognizing and helping clients/supervisees anticipate setbacks. 3. Using culturally appropriate and relevant clinical instruments and assessments approaches. 4. Understanding how distress related to their unique multicultural contexts and identities might impact their work with you (race, gender, ethnicity, social class, sexual orientation, abilities, religion, etc). STRATEGY 3:Facilitating Awareness 1. Owning your biases, assumptions, and worldviews and determining how your past experiences have contributed to how you interact with culturally similar and culturally different others (e.g., recognizing how your own projections and perspectives might help of hinder others). 2. Rephrasing , reframing, summarizing, and reflecting what you or your supervisee is hearing and seeing as thematic patterns in a client’s presenting material. STRATEGY 3 continued: Facilitating Awareness 3. Helping the client’s/supervisee’s better understand how their functional behaviors, defense, language, values, thoughts, feelings, and reactions influence their way of engaging in the world and their counseling work. STRATEGY 4: Setting goals, taking action and instigating change: 1. Exploring theoretical orientations and assumptions from a culturally sensitive perspective. 2. Becoming a subject companion by learning about the clients cultural background in session and outside of your clinical work. 3. Respecting a clients need for distance and preferences for managing challenges in ways that are not consistent with “traditional therapeutic interventions”. STRATEGY 4 Continued: Setting goals, taking action and instigating change: 4. Restoring balance and helping the client create better harmony in his/ her life. 5. Empowering yourself and your client/ supervisee by teaching problem solving skills, building their knowledge, skills, and awareness necessary to be more effective at negotiating their opportunities and challenges. STRATEGY 5: Being accountable, giving feedback, and evaluating outcomes: 1. Reviewing the client’s initial presenting concerns, patterns in the client’s presenting issues, relevant theoretical approaches and diagnosis, and assessing progress formally and informally on a regular basis inside and outside of counseling and supervision sessions. 2. Examining congruence and incongruence between clinical goals and outcomes and working with your supervisor to develop new strategies for meeting goals and enhancing outcomes. STRATEGY 5 Continued: Being accountable, giving feedback, and evaluating outcomes: 3. Remembering that making mistakes and knowing your strengths and weaknesses requires honest exploration and reflection of your knowledge, skills, and awareness as well as a commitment to continuous training and development.
