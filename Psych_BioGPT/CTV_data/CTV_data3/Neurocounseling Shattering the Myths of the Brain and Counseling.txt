THERAPY Talks Neurocounseling: Shattering the Myths of the Brain and Counseling Lori A. Russell-Chapin 

00:01:55
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Thank you so much for inviting me today. Neurocounseling is very, very new in our field but it's something I'm really excited about talking to you about today. So I'm hoping to shatter some of the myths of the brain and counseling in general. And I think the way to do that is I have to talk to you a little bit about something that just happened to me. Uhm, I've been doing counseling for a very long time and, uhm, as a neurofeedback specialist, I really want to learn as much about my own brain as possible. So last, I've been doing 5-channel EEGs for assessment in neurofeedback. But last talk I said I went to a training, and, ah, in this training they had 20 of us in there and they actually did a 19-channel EEG on each of our brain. So there's-- imagine you know, 19 electrodes all over your head. Uhm, it's very messy but it's fascinating so afterwards they analyzed the statistics and the artifact in any muscles are effects that come out so they make sure it's pure. And then they give you this, uhm, assessment about your brain and this, this instructor said, "Now, would any of you like to share anything about your brain? Would you let me show you-- your actual assessment on this large LCD projector?" And my husband's nudging me and he say, "Yeah, yeah, Lori you should do that." So I said, "Yes, I'd be happy to do that." So, they put the two, uhm, first, they were all helping professionals up and, and what they do, the software is incredible. It's-- if you can imagine it's, uhm, it takes your brain you know, at 3D and it rotates your brain 360°. So you can see every aspect of your brain. And so, uhm, he put the first two up and they say-- said they were pretty healthy brains. And then he put mine up and he did this. "Oh, oh, oh, my gosh." And now I'm getting really nervous because he's talking about my brain in front of all these people. And he said, "You have the busiest brain I have ever seen." Now, I knew this wasn't a good thing but I was in too far so I had to keep going. And so I wanna share with you, uhm, I wanna share with all the audience this picture. 

00:03:55
Delta Amplitude Asymmetry 

00:03:55
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And you don't have to know anything about anything but if you see this kind of schematic in front of you and you know, these are 19 different channels. And most of them work really good except there are two that look really bad. You'll notice that on the bottom there's occipital lobe too and there's F7. They look not so good and so this-- instructor says to the whole class, "I think this woman had a brain concussion." And I said, "No, I haven't." And he said, "Yes, you have." And I could not recollect any brain trauma. Now, since that time I've kinda gone backward with my brother, my parents are both, uhm, passed away unfortunately so I really couldn't talk to them. But I have figured out when I have this brain concussion and this concussion is so interesting as called the Contrecoup and, and you can kinda see this in the schemata. So you can that whenever I hit my brain or had it accidentally some sort, it hit the back of my-- the-- my brain hit the back of my skull and it impacted it so much that it forced the other part of the brain to go farther up which hit into my left prefrontal cortex and about F7. Not the executive functioning part but an F7. So, suddenly, amazingly every part of me, I mean, I'd-- I've been in my doctoral program they forced you as you know into lots of counseling and I kinda know all my strengths and liabilities. But there were particular things about me that I could not explain. This explains everything. And my husband now is raising his hand going, "Oh, my gosh she tells me everything, I know exactly why my wife is so weird." And honestly this is the truth, I know exactly why I function the way I do. And I just have to tell you this, O2 represents trauma. Now, I didn't have a kind of trauma who I see birds, and you know, I ca-- and I was unconscious but I can tell I have trauma there. The F7 that you see here is really interesting for me, it, it also is very closely connected to the Broca area, the language center. But for me it's controlling stimulus and input control. So I get over stimulated really quickly and I have to just round out these things or I can't even function. When I'm driving in downtown Chicago, everything has to be just perfect. So what I want you to know about neurocounseling is we cannot be afraid of this. Don't be afraid of understanding our own physiology. 

00:06:15
Definition of Neurocounseling Behavioral and psychological symptoms have correlating physiological and neurological underpinnings. 

00:06:15
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And so what I want you to know is the definition of neurocounseling would just be to know that for, for every behavioral and psychological symptom that walks into your office there really is a correlating physiological and neurological underpinning. That can only help us as therapist. It can only make a difference, it's, it's tasked to make a difference in how we view our clients in their world view. So if you wanna embrace neurocounseling, here's what I want you to do. The goals of neurocounseling would be these. 

00:06:45
Goals of Neurocounseling Be better understanding neurobiology and the advances in neuroscience, counselors can shatter many personality and behavioral myths and embrace even more the benefits of the counseling relationship. The knowledge only aids to your clients' wellness and treatment strategies. Being neuro-wise allows counselors to be more efficient and efficacious. 

00:06:45
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN By better understanding on neurobiology and in the advances in neuroscience we can shatter so many personality myths about the brain. And, and personality even myths about neurofeedback, myths about, ah, personality disorders, but if we will embrace neurocounseling, I really believe it, it truly gets to the roots of counseling and that-- in our therapeutic alliance and it allows us to be even more efficacious as helping professionals. So, I don't want you to be neuro like an expert. And, you know, nowadays it seems like we put neuro in front of anything, it's supposed to be true. I'm not buying that. But I am saying to you that I want you to be neuro-wise. I don't want you to be a neuro expert but I also don't want you to be neuro-naïve. I want you to find out the things that could really benefit us. So I'm gonna try to shatter some myths. Some of these things are things you already know but let me just talk to them about real quickly. 

00:07:40
Essential Neuroanatomy Concepts • 100 billion neurons in our 3 pound brain • Neuroplasticity allows rewiring or colonizing to occur. • Neurogenesis, especially in the hippocampus, creates new neurons. • The brain consists of three major regions: forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. 

00:07:40
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN You know that we have this lovely 3-pound brain. Now, most of us have a 3-pound brain. Albert Einstein did not and you would expect his brain to be larger cuz he was so brilliant. In fact his brain was smaller, so get that. But we have this lovely 3-pound brain that has about a 100 billion neurons in it. And what we now know is that we know that through neuroplasticity, that we can build new neuronal pathways until we die. And the brain loves to be challenged and so not only does can we build new neuronal pathways but we have the capacity to build new neurons especially in the hippocampus area, the part of the brain that's internal. If that is true then, there is the myth we can get rid of which is you can teach all dogs new tricks. You can absolutely. So here's the one. You know, I was taught in my doctoral program many years ago however, that you know, by about age 4 our children's brains are pretty well molded. That is so not true. We know that the brain develops from the back to the front. We know that it does not develop probably until about honestly 24 years of age and maybe even 35 years of age. So what I think so fascinating about that and so what develops last is our executive functioning. Now we have two children, they are 22 and 20 now but I really stopped about 4 years ago saying, "You did what? What were you thinking?" Because I knew they were thinking so why, you know, why blame those poor creatures. So I know that our children's brains are actively developing through neuroplasticity, through neurogenesis. And I know that if it's true that our brains probably aren't fully developed till later on that-- about this? Carl Jung was right. How cool is that? He said we began to individuate at the age of 35. No wonder he would see that because by that time our brains are fully developed. I think that's remarkable. My mom died at the age 90 and she was probably as remarkable woman as I've ever met. When she turned 80, she decided she wanted to, uhm, read all the Shakespeare's plays. And I thought, "You know, Mom, why are you doing that?" And then I thought, I know why she's doing that because at 80 she's building new neuronal pathways and she's actually doing neurogenesis at its very best. So my mother was a vital and engage in life till the very end. So that's one thing I want you to think about. I also want you to be aware that just-- I don't-- again, I don't want you to be an expert in this but I think it makes a difference in our clients. They truly if-- we, we have to be able to educate them. So I want you to know that the brain consist of three major brain red-- regions, the forebrain, the midbrain, and the hindbrain. 

00:10:30
Brain Lobes Parietal Lobe Occipital Lobe Cerebellum Brain Stem Temporal Lobe Frontal Lobe 

00:10:30
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And ha-- on, on your screen what I want you to see is just sort of this generic picture of our brain. And I don't again think you have to be experts on each one of those but if a client comes to you and says, "I'm really feeling depressed." We go through all the basic psys-- psychosocial history. We talk about certain symptoms but now we know that probably that depression is housed around the left part of the brain. We know that anxiety is probably housed in the right side of the brain with all these different brain waves going through it. And if I can teach my client that I think that that's pretty phenomenal. I think that just really amazing. It feels to me that if I can educate our clients just a little bit about the brain, they seem to take a little more responsibility about who they are and, and what they can control. I'm kinda back to that intrinsic locus of control. So here are some things I want you to think about. 

00:11:25
Brain-based Treatments • Benefits of Exercise • Heart Rate Variability • Neurofeedback • Nutrition • Sleep Hygiene • Neurotherapy • Education about the Brain to Clients • Birth History, Head Trauma and Other Major Life Events Lori A. Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:11:25
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uhm, this may be-- not be shattering myths but they are brain-based treatments that I think we need to incorporate into our cognitive counseling world. We know that, already we know this. We know that exercise is one of the ba-- one of the best things we can do for our bodies. We actually have some research that says many times exercise is better than an antidepressant. We know that we should be exercising in the morning. And if we can exercise about 20 minutes a day that's as good as it's gonna get. And here's what we know. We know that when we exercise especially in the morning that our brain elicits this brain derived neurotropic factors. And so these cascading hormones tell the rest of our body to wake up, be engaged and let's do some learning. Without that, that couch potato kind of syndrome sets in it and I think we're in trouble. So I think its if-- almost an ethical obligation as counselors that we tell our clients about the benefits of exercise. I think that one of the things that has changed with me more than anything else that-- all my 30 years of doing therapy is when my clients come into my office, one of the first thing I do is I watched their breathing. Most people don't breathe, and I can tell you a highly anxious person comes to my office, they start breathing shallowly in their chest. I know exactly what to do. So I think one of the brain-based treatments we have to do is this heart rate variability. I used it on myself, it took me 3 months to finally figure it out but, uhm, I practiced heart rate variability, breathing through the diaphragm and allowing our-- we have the capacity to actually control the amplitude of our heart rate, that is incredible to me. So I think that's something we can do. Uhm, I'm a fan of neurofeedback so that's a bain-- brain-based treatment and that's something else we go, do it and you know, talk and talk about neurofeedback. Here's another one I think we need to talk about nutrition. We, ah, you don't have to be a dietician to do this but we know that healthy eating helps our need. We need to be talking about that. What about sleep hygiene? I think that's amazing. We know we live in a society of sleep-deprived people. Most people need even to-- here's a myth, even into our old age we need to be getting as much sleep as we can because that's rejuvenates of process, that's hugely important. If your client says, "Well, I'm sleeping about-- I'm taking a lot, ah, sleep aids and I'm sleeping about 4 hours a day or night." That tells you a lot what's going in their life. So that's something we need to do. And any other brain-based intervention that you can think of will help our clients. This is all an aspect of neurocounseling but it talked to you about how I think it's so important to talk just about generically to our clients, about, uhm, the brain and, and education-- educating the brain. But here is something I don't think we do as well as counselors. I know most of us do some really nice psychosocial histories but I'm now delving in more and more into-- I wanna know about your birth, I wanna know about my client's you know, were they vacuum babies, were they forcep babies? Did they have oxygen deprivation at birth? Ah, I wanna know about head traumas. And here's one of my favorite all-time stories. I recently was interviewing a mom and her child because he was coming-- he was presenting with some AD-- symptoms ADHD. And so I did ask mom about birth trauma, she said, "I'm always normal." Uhm, I ask her about any head traumas later in, in the child's life around 6 or 7, he was 9. "No," she said, "no, but I don't think there was any head traumas." And I said, "Well, just anything that you can remember where there might have been some injury to the brain." And she thoughtfully stopped then she said, "Well, you know now, he has brother whose 2 years older and the other day, not the other day but last year, uhm, they were playing with a bat and he hit, you know, Jacob(ph) in the head. Would that be an example of a brain injury?" When I said, "Yeah, uh-hmm, I'm pretty sure that would count." And as mother start thinking about other things came into play. Those are things I think we really need to include in our psychosocial histories. I think the other thing that I would wanna tell you, that I want to incorporate as far as neurocounseling goes. 

00:15:30
Lori A. Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. Continued The brain fires electrically, communicates chemically and moves with physics. One out of three of us have had a brain concussion and don't even know it. Empathy and mirror neurons help in establishing relationship. 

00:15:35
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And I did this, I teach two classes at Bradley right now that, uhm, have information about the brain. And the other day I was in class and I decided I'm gonna bring chocolate chip cookies to class probably because my mother always made them and I like them. But I really wanted them to think about this chocolate chip cookie. And so I brought this cookie in and I gave one to every, every student. And I said, "I want you to look at this, it's really quite incredible cookie." And to make this cookie you have to think about how the ingredients with each other, you have to think about how the electricity has to be just right and how everything has to work to make this cookie happen. And then I said, "Now, when you eat this cookie, I want you to eat it with intension. And I want you to eat it and as you're eating it I want you to think about all the chemistry that's having to happen to make this cookie be digested. I want you to think about all the physics that involved. I want you to think about the electricity, the synaptic responses that are happening just as you eat this cookie." And then I asked the classes, "So tell me how that cookie was." And I had a student raising hand, "That was the best chocolate chip cookie that I have ever eaten." And as-- I thought about that. So here's what I want you to think about with neurocounseling. You have to know that the brain fires electrically, it communicates chemically and it moves with physics. If we, everything we do right now as I'm doing this talk, all that's happening, if I really saw my body as a marvel, would I treat it differently? I think it will impact if we do this with our client, I think it impacts how we view the client and the counseling world. That one was just incredible to me. Uhm, the other thing I think we need to know and I showed you at the beginning of my talk today about, uhm, that I have a contrecoup brain concussion and one out of three of us has an unknown brain concussion. That's amazing. So your client says, "No, but I don't have one." We probably need to look into it if there is chronic, chronic history I would suggest some kind of EEG assessment. I think that's gonna be really important. And the last thing I wanna talk about just a little bit is when we talk about neurocounseling is the whole piece of empathy and mirror neurons. I think they're fascinating. You use them all the time in therapy, I know we do. Uhm, you're with a client and the client begins to brush their hair away and the next thing I know I find myself brushing my hair away or they do their nose, the next thing I know I'm doing their, their nose. That is also how we have therapeutic alliance. Our mirror neurons really help us in therapy and so we need to know more about that because I think it, it truly helps us understand why therapy works. We know therapy works. We've seen behavior changes but now we know it, it works through all these wonderful neuroscience pieces. FMRI Research, I mean it's so much fun. Therapy used to be considered a soft science, it's not a soft science anymore and I love telling my clients that. I love telling insurance providers that. I love telling anybody that we are now in a very hard science. So counseling really works. I think what I'd like you to take away with this and I think it's pretty powerful is that I think it's important that we don't have to take sides. 

00:18:55
Conclusion We don't have to take sides but using all of our counseling skills and all of the recent neuroscience advancements can only make the counseling process more effective for our clients and the profession. 

00:18:55
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I mean what-- the sides that I-- the debate that I hear right now are you know, we just need to stick to counseling, we're good at it, we-- we're deep in the roots of our therapeutic alliance and our relationships and let's not be something we're not. I think we have to embrace neurocounseling. We have to embrace neurophysiology because not only will it make us better with therapeutic alliance but I think it, it gives us this value added benefit. It truly helps you understand what's going on with-- in your client's brain. And it helps your clients understand what's going on with them as well. So it could-- all it make our counseling profession go forward. I think it-- it's better for our clients, it's better for our profession, and I think it's better for us as clinicians. 

00:19:35
Call to Action Professional: You don't have to be neuro-wise, but don't be neuro-naïve either. Explore the basics functioning of the brain parts and embrace neurocounseling for its additive value. Personal: Learn about your brain, its beginnings, your birth and your history. 

00:19:40
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN So the take away I want you to have today from my therapy talk and again I would do a professional take away and, ah, and a personal call to action. Professionally, I am not asking you to be neuro-wise, I am asking you to no, ah, take that back. I want you to be neuro-wise, I don't think you have to be neuro, an expert but I do want you to be neuro-wise. I don't want you to be neuro-naïve. I think that's hugely important. We cannot stick our heads in the sand, it will not help the counseling profession. So I want you to professionally explore the basic functions of the brain, embrace it. It will help your clients and I think it will certainly-- we're advocating and pushing the profession even far-- farther. As far as a personal call to action, I'm really asking you to start learning more about your own brain. There's a whole realm of research right now and it's called phenotypes that truly says that maybe who we are has nothing to do with anything but our brain that it's my brain that makes me my personality. I'm not sure I, I buy that totally but I am buying that a lot. I think our brains have a great impact as to who we are as functioning individuals. And so I'm asking to learn about your beginning, your birth, if your parents aren't around ask other people. Do some investigation. Really understand your history and I think we have to start looking at who we are based from these wonderful bain-- brain-based interventions and wonder-- wonderful theories about the brain. And so I'm hoping that you will shatter some of those myths we have and really embrace neurocounseling. I think it's here to stay and I truly think it makes a difference on how we function in the counseling profession. Thank you so much. 

00:21:35
THERAPY Talks 

00:21:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER Lori, thank you so much. 

00:21:40
JEANNETTE BOLT You're welcome. 

00:21:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER Thank you. I've decided we might change this to your neurotherapy talks since anything that has neuro in front of it that is seen that's true. 

00:21:50
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN There we go. Well, it'll be okay with me. 

00:21:50
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:21:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER Now, you said and actually you mentioned there that not everything that has neuro in front of it is actually, uhm, valid or true or-- what do you think is happening in our field? Because I do see that, that worried a lot more - 

00:22:05
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:22:05
DR. SHANNON DERMER - whether it's interpersonal neurobiology or neurocounseling. What's, what's the good stuff, ah, from the bad stuff. 

00:22:10
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I guess I would just say as helping professionals we need to be investigators and go-- and just because it says neuro don't go-- oh, it must be true. 

00:22:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:22:20
Lori A. Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:22:20
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Go and-- I mean, we-- we're taught how to do research. Excuse me. Go and do that research, figure out what we have to do and decide for yourself whether you think it's valid or not valid. Uhm, I think so much, ah, the, the work I'm doing at the Center for Collaborative Brain Research is work that always does research with functional MRIs. So, I can see changes in the brain. With these young children who were, uhm, ADHD and on similar medication that I did. I could see their brain it-- at the beginning opposed a pretest then I got to see their brain after the treatment. And I could see visibly changes in their brain. 

00:22:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER Uhm. 

00:22:55
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN That is valid information. 

00:23:00
DR. SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:23:00
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And that is the material we need to embrace. 

00:23:00
DR. SHANNON DERMER Great. So, yeah, not all of us are like a we-- are lucky enough to have functional MRIs. 

00:23:05
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:23:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER But, ah... 

00:23:10
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN But we can read. We can go into the journals just because the journal is not, ah, journal that we typically read. Go and read them anyway. Ah, I'm giving it out to all my students. I just gave out an article last week on-- came from the cell, most of it I don't even understand but I'm-- all of us are pretty bright people and we produce them together and we went, "Wow, that's interesting. I didn't have to get it all." Right? That's just fascinating. 

00:23:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER Right. And I have to say there, uhm, I have been seeing more and more about connecting, counseling to the brain and how, what we do as counselors, therapists, psychologists, clinicians that it does actually have an influence on the brain even if we're not trained in neurocounseling or neurotherapy. Ah, for instance, I know Susan Johnson had done some work with functional MRIs and looking at when you have, uhm, someone-- a loved one holding your hand. 

00:24:00
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hand. 

00:24:00
DR. SHANNON DERMER And they, ah, and you're experiencing pain that you actually experienced pain differently - 

00:24:05
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:24:05
DR. SHANNON DERMER - when you have someone near attach to you, holding your hand - 

00:24:10
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Absolutely. 

00:24:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER - versus a stranger. 

00:24:10
Lori A. Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:24:10
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Absolutely. And I know part of our roots in counseling happens to be therapeutic alliance, it happens to be relationships. But we also know that with our mirror neurons we can make a difference with psychological residents. I kinda believe that and I know that there are things that have come out of my mouth as a therapist that weren't mine. And I'm thinking to myself, well that was really good. But I knew it wasn't mine but I think it happened because we have that symbiotic relationship, we have that psychological residents going on. But those are brain-based connections. 

00:24:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER Now, can you, uhm, define may be a little bit mirror neurons and speak a little bit more about those cuz I've heard it before - 

00:24:45
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:24:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER - but maybe some people are watching haven't. 

00:24:50
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN One of the best I have-- kind of a fan in YouTube and one of the best YouTube videos I ever saw that-- is the best answer to your question where there's two babies, they were tiny little babies and they were, uhm, one baby would go with their leg, would move their leg. And then the other baby would move their leg and one-- and honestly it was like they saw each-- they're like a mirror. The other baby would go like this and the baby go like this. That's what happens with mir-- mirror neurons. It, it gives us the capacity to connect and, and learn and observe from one another. Now that's good news and bad news. One of the things I love to teach and, and, uhm, counseling to my clients and I don't think you have to be a neuro expert to do this. But the difference between plasticity and negative plasticity, I think many of us that had some real bad habits and our synip-- synaptic response is just go that way. That's the, that's the way that they are routed. That's negative plasticity, it's not healthy. But with, with compete, com-- constant and continuing, I guess practice we build new neuronal pathways and has to go this way. And so, you know, we, we have to work at to do it that way but those are the connections that I think make a difference and our clients get that. They understand, "Oh, I can keep going this." Or, "Oh, I can practice and have-- go a healthier direction in my brain." 

00:26:05
DR. SHANNON DERMER So you're saying our brain can have bad habits? 

00:26:10
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah, unfortunately I think so. Yeah, I'm pretty sure we all have those. 

00:26:15
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:26:15
DR. SHANNON DERMER So when our brain forms bad habits it's just the pathway that gets keeping using over and over again. 

00:26:20
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Almost like a rut. And the example I used, ah, from Wyoming and the example that, that sticks in my head is you know, if you're on top of a mountain peak and you look down and I just watched all the Olympics and I love them. But, uhm, I-- ah, you look down in the mountain peak and that's wonderful and then you take your skis and you go down then. It has a little rut there and then you go down it again and again, and again and the rut gets deeper and deeper. If you don't quit that it-- that's just the way the synaptic responses go. So it takes a while for us to change our habits. 

00:26:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:26:45
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN You know, it takes a little bit of time and a lot of work. 

00:26:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER So you're building a new pathway in your brain - 

00:26:50
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:26:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER - when you're changing a habit. 

00:26:55
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And yes, and that's the thing I didn't say, uhm, with the template I showed when I was talking with my contrecoup. You know, those are damaged areas in my brain and that's a little bit sad for me to see. But it doesn't seem to matter because our brain has the capacity to rewire itself. And there's different connectivity going on in my brain. So, I probably have to work harder but you know, it's, it's actually on to a different direction. 

00:27:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER So our brain I know can, uhm, accommodate for problems that we've had injuries, traumas that we've had so it creates almost like a little detour - 

00:27:25
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:27:25
DR. SHANNON DERMER - from the usual path. 

00:27:25
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Connectivity pass a different - 

00:27:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER Okay. 

00:27:30
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN - and more efficient, I'm hoping now. 

00:27:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER Now, I want you to say a little bit, you have a book. 

00:27:35
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:27:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER I want you to say a little about your book because that is meant to... 

00:27:35
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh, thank you. Thank you. 

00:27:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER That is meant to help the, ah, the clinician know a little bit more about - 

00:27:40
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:27:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER - neurotherapy and neurofeedback, correct? 

00:27:45
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm, and I would have to say, uhm, a lot new neuronal pathways were developed as we are writing this book. My husband and I wrote this together. And, uhm, I think this is a book-- it's not-- you don't have to be an expert, but this is a book that would give you a really like one-stop shopping at-- experience of what do you need to know about the brain. There's some wonderful things in there about self-regulation about physiology in the brain. If you don't know where to look I think that's why we wrote it. I could not find this book and so I went directly then they said, "Well, then write it." So Ted and I wrote. And, uhm, this is truly a labor of love but I'm so pleased because I keep, I keep going into it because I, I know where everything is. And so I think it would help anyone who wants to know about the brain, understand more about what we can do. I supposed we could have labeled it neurocounseling but, uhm, we decided to label it neurotherapy and neurofeedback instead. 

00:28:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER Good. So if you wanna learn a little bit more about, ah, neurocounseling and neurotherapy, ah, please look up Dr. Russell-Chapin's book but also please go to Alexander Street Press' website so you can learn more about Dr. Russell-Chapin and also more about some of our other, ah, therapy talks with some of our other experts. Thank you for joining us today and thank you Dr. Russell-Chapin for helping us learn about the brain. 

00:29:00
DR. LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN You're welcome and thank you and don't be afraid of this stuff. I hadn't said that but don't be afraid it's gonna-- it's really gonna make a difference. 

00:29:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER Well, I'm gonna be braver, I'm not afraid. Thank you. 

00:29:10
