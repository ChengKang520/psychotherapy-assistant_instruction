SHANNON DERMER Welcome. I'm Dr. Shannon Dermer from Governors State University. I'm the Chair of the Division of Psychology and Counseling. And I'm here today with Dr. Terri Christiansen who is going to be talking to you about Research and Program Evolution. Dr. Christiansen?

00:00:40
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Hi. Umm… I'm Dr. Terri Christiansen, and I'm an Assistant Professor at Governors State University. I'm also duly licensed as a Clinical and School Psychologist, and I've been practicing for about 18 years umm… in the clinical setting as well as teaching um… 

00:00:55
SHANNON DERMER Good. Yeah, I know, and that background for you really does inform… inform research and program evaluation because… and correct me if I'm wrong, but good research and program evaluation usually for our fields is a little bit of statistical knowledge and things like that, but especially for program knowledge, it's also a lot about understanding clinical work in counseling or therapy. 

00:01:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Yeah. It… it becomes a little bit of the marriage of both to umm… come up with some good information to again as we're in that era of evidence-based practice, and whether we're in school settings or organizational settings or even in our own practice, we want to be looking at as we implement programs, how effective are they? Are the evidence-based? What kinds of movement are we getting with the program? It's very much the same way that we may with an individual. 

00:01:50
SHANNON DERMER Okay, good. So then umm… for those people who aren't as familiar with research and program evaluation, so it's really… it can't be with an individual that you are kind of assessing your effectiveness, but really program evaluation is a particular program that has been developed, and is being used with clients, and measuring maybe its overall effectiveness, right, but also maybe components of that program. Is that accurate? 

00:02:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Certainly. Umm… when… when we take on program evaluation and for example, as a counselor, a counselor may be looking at starting up an anti-bullying program in the school setting, and as they begin to look at what type of a program they want to implement, and at what level, are we looking at doing that at a preventative level, are we targeting some folks who are a bit more at risk, or is it a more intensive intervention because we've identified a small group of students who seem to be particularly umm… impacted, for example, by the bullying. 

00:02:50
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So is it a needs assessment like who needs these interventions? Is that part of a program uh… assessment? 

00:03:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. Umm… different… generally, a needs assessment is a great way to start off with, you know, implementation of our program, and umm… then in terms of evaluating it, because we really want to see, and we want to be assessing from the stakeholders, and by stakeholders, if we're talking about a school setting, that's going to include the administrators, the teachers, the students themselves, the parents possibly. There is different umm… with the more involvement, the more support that we have for our program in identifying what people are seeing is relevant. If I as a counselor or a psychologist go in and say, "This is what I wanted to do, because it's my thing," as opposed to assessing whether the students see that as a need, and teachers are seeing that as a need, I could fail miserably. 

00:03:50
SHANNON DERMER Okay, good. So a stakeholder is, so as a friend of mine would say someone who has some skin in the game. It's important to them. It affects them. Umm… and so you want to make sure when you're doing any kind of assessment, whether it's a needs assessment, who needs what, where, when uh… or the full program assessment of looking at something that's a program that's already in place, then umm… you want to make sure that it connects to the stakeholders that it gives them important information that they can then use to make their lives better or more efficient or whatever. 

00:04:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. And again, I think, one of the things to think about as counselors becomes that a lot of times when we start thinking about assessment, we start thinking this is involving numbers and data, and we get a little bit overwhelmed and intimidated by it especially with all the other pieces that they may be juggling during the course of their day, but this doesn't have to be quite that complex. Part of it can be as simple as developing a few questions and saying out of the following umm… five areas, which ones would you pick as your top three concerns and rate them accordingly so that you start to get some of that information. Sometimes we may look at pre-existing records. So, for example, if I'm looking at discipline referrals, what types of things seem to be stacking up? And that may drive how I'm going to approach my needs assessment in terms of saying, "This is what our existing data says based on just school records." 

00:05:20
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:05:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN And do students and teachers see this as a problem as well? 

00:05:25
SHANNON DERMER Right. So you could… yeah. So you could collect information like why are most of the kids who are referred to the school counselor or social worker whoever referred? You know, is it anger issues? Is it depression? Is it anxiety? And then maybe based on the top three reasons that they referred, which you could look at records or you could also ask people. You could do a simple little survey. You could do all of those, and see based on the top three reasons that they referred, you might create a program around that. 

00:05:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:05:55
SHANNON DERMER Okay, good. Good. So it's not something that has to be scary. I mean, sure, there are like program, you know, assessments. I have all kinds of statistics and numbers, and things like that, but for the average clinician, they should really be able to use some basic either qualitative, which is more like words and ideas or quantitative, which is numbers based to kind of assess what they're doing, and the effectiveness. 

00:06:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. I think paying attention to what types of issues seem to be popping out most or what types of umm… as I talk with folks what types of things do I continually hear that they're saying seems to be problematic, and then just going and digging around a little bit. It's a bit like being a detective to say what really is out there, where's the evidence that supports moving forward. And again, are people receptive to that need? Are they… are they attuned with it? 

00:06:50
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So being a bit of a detective, I'd say that probably most clinicians, not all, have this curiosity in them. That's why they want to work with people. They want to help with people, so help people, so using that curiosity around programs and needs, you… you are just channeling your curiosity in a slightly different way that helps… that helps with the clinical part. 

00:07:15
SHANNON DERMER Absolutely. I think, umm… one of the things that we want to be aware as… as counselors or therapist are biases that we may bring to the table, and often times by bringing in that additional information it… it… we can either find the thing support our intuition or our thought thinking process or we may find something that is… is really much deeper and more important in terms of what's at the root, and so we want to be pulling all that information in. 

00:07:45
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. That's a great point, because I think a lot of times we think oh, just our intuition or you know, these uh… sometimes things that are in society like this should be what works. So this should be what you assessed don't necessarily workout when we do research, like I know the example I always give my students with, you know, which is if you are a better communicator, do you have a better marriage and all of… all of them were like, you know, relationship, and all of them like yes, that is the key, good communication. Well, I know from some of the research, it's not necessarily that you communicate a lot. It's that your style of communication or dealing with emotion is matched with your partner. If you're both avoiders, that's okay. If you're both big communicators, that's okay. If you're both people who like to be, you know, bicker and… and work out your communication and issues that way, that's okay, but it's if you have similar styles… 

00:08:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. 

00:08:30
SHANNON DERMER You know, but that one is one that goes against their intuition that we wouldn't have known unless someone had done a research on it. 

00:08:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. Something that came to mind as you were talking about that was the notion of our theoretical orientations, and how we even start to conceptualize. So if somebody comes in and they're talking about overwhelming and where I might start to approach that from what's going on, what's been going on in their life in terms of need, frustration, things of that sort. And in reality, what's happening is right here and now I'm overloaded, and that's leading me to feel inadequate. So sometimes again, the data really helps keep us in check a bit umm… with the direction that we're moving. 

00:09:15
SHANNON DERMER Right, okay, good. So we should be guided by our model. You are talking from a psychodynamic perspective there with needs frustration, but sometimes it's something more immediate, like you are in that example, there's some kind of a crisis that's going on, and sometimes you have to move away from your model a little bit, and pay attention to the data that's sitting right there in front of you, which sometimes matches what your model and where you want to go, but sometimes it leads you in a different direction. 

00:09:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:09:40
SHANNON DERMER And that's the importance of collecting data, and assessing and checking yourself to see if you're going in an effective direction. 

00:09:45
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Um-um. Umm… we also want to use that data to start with the second phase, which starts to become about setting our goals, our objectives, and what our outcomes are for the program that we're going to be looking at, and again, we're in the era of evidence-based practice. So, coming up with measurable goals umm… that… that drive the programs that we're using and what we're looking to accomplish is… is very important. 

00:10:15
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So you're not talking about now goals for an individual client. You are talking about for a program. 

00:10:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:10:20
SHANNON DERMER That you have to set, you can't assess something that isn't… well, it's very difficult to assess something that isn't clearly defined and measurable. So that's important too as part of program development is creating clear measurable outcomes for that program. 

00:10:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Certainly. And again, very similar to in an individual client case, we work from a similar framework, which is to be thinking about the organization or the organization's values. If it's a school setting, for example, what are the values? What are the target goals that the school has set for itself and how does this program fit with that or not fit that becomes important, as we're starting to think about that. 

00:11:05
SHANNON DERMER Great. So instead of some people being like, "oh, well, research or program development skills are so much different than my clinical skills." You are actually saying, no, there are lot of similarities to working with clients as well as working with a program or a system. A lot of the same skills you do to, you know, to do really accountable clear effective counseling you also use in program development. 

00:11:25
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN It's exactly, it's a very similar type of process just with more folks, so more data to try and manage. 

00:11:35
SHANNON DERMER Great. So tell me what are the basic things that everyone should know about program development, some basic terms or concepts? 

00:11:40
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Umm… so as we are looking at program development, and we start to think about implementation of a program, and again, we will stick with that example of a bullying umm… program, an anti-bullying program that we're utilizing at a couple of different levels within an organization. One of the things that again becomes very important is going back to setting goals that are measurable specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely that smart goal type of piece. We need to be putting out some anchors and guideposts, so to speak that we are looking to accomplish are the implementation and how we're going to actually measure that. So that becomes a very important consideration. What… how… what are our outcome indicators? How if I'm going to look at umm… decreasing bullying, what is that going to look like in terms of the specific types of things I'm going to be a, measuring and b, looking for in terms of improvement. 

00:12:45
SHANNON DERMER Okay, good. So there needs to be clear goals or smart goals like we often talk about with clients. You do the same thing for a program that you're evaluating and umm… that there need to be clearly defined goals, uh… but they also need to be measurable because it doesn't do you any good if your goals, that might be a good goal, but if it's not measurable, then how do you evaluate it? How do you assess it? 

00:13:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. So things that we might be looking at in terms of outcomes if we were using that bullying example might be what our discipline referrals looking like for interpersonal conflict. 

00:13:20
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So you would expect to see a decrease in referrals over time for interpersonal conflict once this program is instituted. 

00:13:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. And again, I think it becomes a collaborative process when we're working. It's not just driven by the person who's implementing the program. There should be… should be following a little bit of the clients' needs, meaning it might be umm… within a school. So we're looking at what does the schools need? How… how do we move forward with umm… putting that program in place? 

00:13:55
SHANNON DERMER So it might not just be umm… reducing… reducing bullying behavior. There might be some interventions and therefore more prosocial behavior, so it's reducing aggression, but also increasing umm… you know, helpful interactions between kids. 

00:14:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. So again, that might go back a little bit to the needs assessment where we are looking at who is… who seems to be experiencing, is bullying a bigger problem in a specific classroom? Is it specific to students who are second language learners? Those types of things become important to say how are we going to… what are we going to do, possibly at a school-wide level, and what… what might we do in other ways to bolster and resolve this problem? 

00:14:45
SHANNON DERMER Good. So when you're figuring that out, you had to figure out is this a school-wide program that we do? Is it for a particular population uh… within the school? Uh, is it for a particular classroom whether something going on or it maybe even be… be that it's with particular umm… teachers uh… that their style, that like not that they are doing anything wrong, but maybe they just refer more often for that kind of stuff, because they see it, you know, they tend to interpret more things as aggressive behavior or bullying behavior. 

00:15:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Sure. 

00:15:15
SHANNON DERMER So it could be that it's school-wide type of things. It could be that it's with a particular group. It could be training to teachers. It could be interventions with students, and so part of that would be based on the stakeholders what they want and that needs assessment that you looked at maybe some of the records of umm… what is needed based on referrals and things like that, correct? 

00:15:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:15:35
SHANNON DERMER Okay, good. So what… what are some other basic ideas, so measurable outcomes because there is no good in having these goals if they can't be evaluated with the program of valuation or assessment, what else are some basic things that people need to know? 

00:15:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Umm… things that we want to be thinking about, I mean, we want to be clean and defining, and sometimes that can be umm… be one of the most tedious pieces, so to speak is who are we going to be targeting? How… what is the designing, what that is going to look like, and then how are we going to measure it, and collect that specific information that we're needing to kind of see what the impact has been? So similar to things become deciding again, we may use some existing records that umm… come through discipline referrals, but we may also be administering measures to look at student attitudes, beliefs umm… and things of that nature. And we want to again, be looking at those measures, are they solid measures? Are they going to give us the type of information that umm… we are looking to get so that they are reliable and they are valid. 

00:16:50
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So it sounds like you're saying not just who, but how you assess them, what measures you're using it, and are those good measures, but also you mentioned something that a lot of times people don't think enough about I think, which is, how do you define something. So bullying, how are you gonna define if you're not doing this just, you know, school-wide, you're doing it with a certain group of let's say you want to only do these interventions with kids who have been labeled bullies, how do you define bullying in order to identify these kids, you know, is it that they have a certain number of referrals? It is a particular aggressive act that they did? Is it a self-referral? Is it from teachers that just labeled them that? Whether they are, they aren't, you know, how are you going to define what is a bully? 

00:17:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. That… that needs to be determined as we move forward so that we're decide… you know, that begins to drive how we are going to approach it. How we are going to assess it? 

00:17:45
SHANNON DERMER Right. So defining that, deciding who fits that, and then how you're going to measure that, and what the outcomes are that you wanted, you know, a decrease in this or an increase in that, you know. 

00:17:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I think it's important to think about umm… when we're looking at program evaluation, thinking about how we get some good information before we start the intervention because how we are going to determine its effectiveness is going to be based in part with where we're at when we start, and where we're at after the intervention. We need to be able to have a pre and a post. Sometimes too what we want to look at is if we try an intervention or a program with a specific set of students, what happens with the students who aren't getting the program? What do we see going on with them? 

00:18:35
SHANNON DERMER So if the control group… 

00:18:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN The control groups. 

00:18:35
SHANNON DERMER And you are talking about, let's say, pre test and post test or baseline data, I remember a little bit. 

00:18:45
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Yeah. Looking at where so… and that gets into the measurability component so that we can actually see as opposed to just say, yeah, that looks like something good happened, and work off of our intuition. 

00:18:55
SHANNON DERMER Right. Okay, good. So when you think about a minute left before you're going to do like a little demonstration, what do you want to leave everyone with knowing before we moved to like the little interview demonstration portion? 

00:19:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I think, umm… in this era of evidence-based practice where we're all being pulled in to look at these numbers and working through our own phobia, or anxiety about working with these numbers, part of it is working collaboratively with other colleagues. Umm… it's helpful to brainstorm and get that different perspective and also to have different… different folks who are helping to work through those logistics. It doesn't have to be as scary as it sounds. Umm… working through those numbers may be as specific as looking at comparisons of averages or percentages. We can start at very basic levels, how many… what percentage of students were bullying before the intervention and what percentage of bullying do we have reported now, and being able to look at it in that capacity. 

00:20:00
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So… so the main things you want people to know is that it doesn't have to be complex and overwhelming that, you know, there is all levels of information and sometimes simple is better and very informative. And then also that use your clinical skills that you are already… that you already have in order to do good program evaluation, which means being collaborative and getting to what people really want and fining things well and defining goals well, and if you use those skills that you already have as a clinician, you can also use those for a program evaluation. 

00:20:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. I think then program evaluation becomes a very rewarding process instead of an overwhelming one. 

00:20:40
SHANNON DERMER Excellent. Well, I look forward to… to your next demonstration of how to put some of that stuff into effect. 

00:20:45
RESEARCH & PROGRAM EVALUATION: 

00:20:45
EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 

00:20:45
INTERVIEW 

00:20:45
with Terri Christiansen, Ph.D. 

00:20:45
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:20:50
SHANNON DERMER So Dr. Christiansen, I know earlier we talked a little bit about some basic concepts that people may need to understand in order to understand research and program evaluation. But I'm going to take this time now to help uh… bring it alive or you're actually going to bring it alive, some of those concepts that you are talking about. I'm going to do a little interview, and ask you about a real project that you did, where you did research and program evaluation. 

00:21:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN okay. 

00:21:15
SHANNON DERMER So, Terri, why don't you tell us a little bit about the program that you evaluated? 

00:21:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Sure. Umm… some colleagues here at the University had actually obtained a rather sizable grant umm… and the grant was geared towards working with children who have had adverse childhood experiences. Umm… and as part of that grant, we were invited to create a project that would support adverse childhood experiences and umm… some colleagues and I got together, and decided we would like to look at implementing mindfulness curriculum for children umm… who are at risk, considered at risk, socioeconomically challenged with that experience prior trauma. And so that was how the project came about and we were fortunate to umm… have the opportunity to do that utilizing a family development center that was nearby umm… where they had some students who fit the criteria, and we were able to umm… work with them. 

00:22:20
SHANNON DERMER Oh, okay. So the grant was really to help kids who are at risk who uh… either had experienced trauma or might be at risk for experiencing trauma, and so you then created and implemented, or you and your colleagues then created and implemented a program at a little family development center where they have kids in… I think it's before preschool, early headstart all the way up to age, do you know what the highest age is? 

00:22:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I think it goes up through grade school, but umm… we specifically targeted umm… the preschool children over there in the… in the classrooms… 

00:23:00
SHANNON DERMER Okay. 

00:23:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN At the family development center. 

00:23:00
SHANNON DERMER So that was one of the things you talked about that was important with program evaluation is that you had to define what population you are going to use, so you didn't use the whole population. You are going to talk more about the study in a minute, but you didn't use the whole population that was available over there. You defined a very specific. You said the umm… preschool? 

00:23:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Preschool. 

00:23:15
SHANNON DERMER Preschool. 

00:23:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN The preschool students, and it was actually umm… a bit serendipitous, because I had received an email from the director of that center umm… during the probably about a year prior to this opportunity coming up asking for implementation of a similar type of project something that would be working and supporting prosocial skills with the children over there at the center umm… to remediate some of the challenges that they were experiencing around behavior impacting learning in the atmosphere of the classroom. 

00:23:50
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So earlier when we had done intro part of basic concepts, you had mentioned the concept of the stakeholder, so the family development center who contacted you about maybe creating this program was a stakeholder. The funding source would be a stakeholder. 

00:24:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Certainly. 

00:24:10
SHANNON DERMER Who else would be stakeholders in this project? 

00:24:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN The students umm… would be stakeholders as along with their families, and the teachers certainly who are overseeing them in the classroom are also stakeholders. 

00:24:20
SHANNON DERMER Okay, good. So uh… what you are doing basically is creating a mindfulness program to as an intervention or prevention for some of these at risk kids. So tell me how did you get interested in that? 

00:24:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Well, I was able to see on a regular basis the impact of social emotional regulation on learning, and umm… often times was this notion that social emotional needs were something that were taken care of at home and that coming to school was academically focused. There wasn't a defined need or belief even in the idea that explicit instruction in social emotional learning was something a valuable… a value in the classroom. Umm… so part of that was seeing that through my day and day our experiences with children who were struggling, it was impeding their learning and part of that was trying to get those pieces moving through my practice. Another part of it was even just through my own reading umm… somebody by the name of Walter Mitchell long ago did an interesting study called the marshmallow test, and his work… 

00:25:35
SHANNON DERMER Oh, I remember that. Yeah. 

00:25:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN That is… it was back in the late 60s, early 70s, and extended over a pretty umm… long span of time, a 30 year span of time, and what they looked at with children were those who were able to… they were given the marshmallow and told that if they could hold on and not eat that marshmallow that when the person came back, they would get two marshmallows. And so really entertaining and interesting findings, but some of the most powerful pieces that came from that work were seeing that years later, children who were able to self-regulate and self-control actually had higher levels of achievement, had better health outcomes, and were defined by their colleagues, family members as more competent than children who struggled with that self-regulation. So the notion of saying how do we support this with children so that we can actually increase is something that we can intervene upon. There are differences in children. Some… a child may very much struggle with self-regulation where another child may do quite well with it, but the idea that that can actually be impacted and changed through things like teaching of prosocial behaviors through work on executive functioning types of things that help with their cognitive flexibility. For example, just thinking of the marshmallow as a cloud that you would be floating on as opposed to this delicious marshmallow helps… helps in terms of what we're doing with our self-regulation. So umm… that was where a lot of that interest came in. I also have some colleagues who were umm… quite interested in work with mindfulness, and so we felt like it would be a nice, you know, collaboration to be able to pull in mindfulness in the ways that we could look at how that would support that prosocial, those executive functioning, that achievement piece and look at… look at that specifically with some of our younger students who are considered at risk. 

00:27:50
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So you are using some mindfulness techniques to get it at the prosocial behaviors, some of the executive functioning skills and what was the last one that you said? 

00:27:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Umm… the prosocial, the executive functioning, self-control, self-regulation and self-control. 

00:28:05
SHANNON DERMER Self-regulation, okay. So you're using mindfulness as a way to influence those. 

00:28:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:28:10
SHANNON DERMER So what type of evaluation did you conduct and why? 

00:28:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Well, we didn't talk about this earlier, but there is actually different kinds of evaluation that can be done. Umm… the first is something called process evaluation and that really becomes about just looking at the actual process. A lot of times it's more associated with things where we do have grants in place, because there's a need for documentation and showing what's happening there in the work process. So umm… process evaluation was part of what we ended up doing, but we also wanted certainly to look at outcome of valuation where we'd be looking at where students were before we implemented the intervention, the program and where they were after the fact. Umm… we also wanted to have a group out there that would become the control group. 

00:29:05
SHANNON DERMER That didn't get any kind of intervention. 

00:29:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN That didn't get any kind of intervention so that we could look at the differences between those groups as opposed to saying the children weren't doing better because they developed over that span of time. 

00:29:15
SHANNON DERMER Oh, great. Got you. So you had to have a comparison group because sometimes kids might get better at some of those skills that you are measuring just because they're little bit older versus your intervention, which is the mindfulness? 

00:29:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. And since we were approaching it from a research standpoint, you know, we really thought that piece was important obviously, but if we were just going into this family development center, and implementing this strictly for the sake of a program, certainly we wouldn't… we might ideally want to have those pieces in place, but again for counselors out there who are thinking about implementing programs, part of it becomes a little bit overwhelming sometimes holding all of this pieces due to time resources umm… just being spread very thin. So the idea of just saying we can get a pre-measure and a post-measure, and that becomes a nice way of seeing what kind of effect we've had with our program. 

00:30:10
SHANNON DERMER Good. Okay. And earlier when we're talking about basic concepts and ideas in program evaluation, research and program evaluation, you stated like for counseling or therapy that goals are important for defining outcomes. What specific goals did you set and what were the related outcomes that you defined for the mindfulness program? 

00:30:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Sure. The specific goals that we were looking at were very similar to another study that had been conducted previously by Richard Davidson and some of his colleagues up at the University of Wisconsin. And that study was somewhat groundbreaking in terms of looking at the impact with young children. So we specifically targeted similar types of goals that come about as a result of mindfulness things like specifically prosocial behaviors. We wanted to also… 

00:31:00
SHANNON DERMER Can you give me an example of a prosocial behavior? 

00:31:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Sharing. 

00:31:05
SHANNON DERMER Oh, okay. For… not kindergartens, preschoolers, that's a good… 

00:31:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN For a preschool. 

00:31:10
SHANNON DERMER Prosocial behavior. 

00:31:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Sharing, caring, how do we resolve conflicts, umm… how do I rein in my feelings when I'm at a point of frustration, those types of things. Umm… and uh… we also wanted to look at executive functioning. That's a bit of a hot one in the educational realm right now and when we're talking about executive functioning, we're talking about thinking and planning umm… being able to control our impulses, being able to be… 

00:31:40
SHANNON DERMER Not to eat the marshmallow. 

00:31:40
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Not to eat the marshmallow, being able to be flexible in our thinking, umm… and exhibiting some self-control. So the other area that we obviously wanted to look at similar to the work that had been done by Michelle was to look at what we saw with achievement because that's also important as well. 

00:32:00
SHANNON DERMER How are you defining achievement for umm… preschoolers? 

00:32:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Believe it or not, they get report cards as well so. 

00:32:05
SHANNON DERMER What? 

00:32:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN It's handled a little bit differently, and more on a Likert Scale where they might get a rating of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, in 5 different domains from health to their socialization to their language development to their learning skills looking at those types of areas. So we did look at ratings in that capacity as well. 

00:32:30
SHANNON DERMER So you were comparing then some of the scores. And you can tell us the test in a minute how you measured those, but you are comparing some of the scores on those prosocial behaviors, some of those executive functions, and then how they are graded on their report card in those different areas. You are comparing the group that was receiving the mindfulness interventions to the group that was not receiving, and you would expect to see a statistically significant higher… 

00:33:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. Yeah. 

00:33:00
SHANNON DERMER Achievement or you know, scores on prosocial behaviors for the group receiving the intervention versus the group not receiving. 

00:33:05
SHANNON DERMER Right. Thanks for bringing me back to that piece, because with research what the question or the goal becomes framed around do we see significant difference. If we were just approaching this from the standpoint of let's see how much we can increase, and we defined it as we're looking for a 20 percent improvement in sharing, for example, a goal might look more along the lines of over the course of a semester we would like to, you know, we plan on achieving a 20 percent increase in sharing, as defined by their ability to umm… give their stickers, more stickers away umm… 

00:33:45
SHANNON DERMER Okay, good. So you could do either uh… or both. You could look at an increase or you could look at a significant difference between a control group or… or both depending on some of the goals of your… your study. 

00:34:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Sure, absolutely. 

00:34:00
SHANNON DERMER Good. So tell me in this particular situation with this example of research and program evaluation about your sample and your procedures? 

00:34:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay, so we had the defined place that we were going to be working with that was kind of dictated by the grant, and what we were able to do was we recruited six classrooms from that family development center, and within those we sent home to all of the 99 students in those six classrooms, we had sent home consent forms and invited folks to participate. Out of that umm… group that the surveys or consent forms that we sent out, we obtained umm… 68 from… from the folks that said yes, they were willing to participate. And based on that then we randomly assigned the classrooms to either a treatment condition or a control condition. Umm… so we ended up in the treatment condition having 30 students and then we had 38 in the control condition where they were not getting the curriculum, the mindfulness curriculum. 

00:35:10
SHANNON DERMER Good. And what were the measures then that you used to test whether these things were effective or not? 

00:35:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Well, and then in this case because we were replicating something we followed what had been used previously umm… to look at the prosocial what had been done in this prior study was they looked at a sharing task, and the sharing task was a for trial type of situation where a child was given 10 stickers, and they had identified a preferred peer and a not so preferred peer, and told these are your stickers, how many will you give to this person, or to this person it's up to you. They also were introduced on another trial to appear who was sick, and each of those trials they got to determine how many they were going to keep for themselves versus how many of they were going to give away. Another task that we looked at umm… we looked at some executive functioning types of tasks. And specifically, there were two types of tasks. One was called the Flanker test, and in that test, it's a measure of inhibitory control so can I refrain from just jumping, and there is a layout of five stimuli on a computer screen. They may be fishes, and the fish are all swimming the same way, and we're watching the middle one and when they're going all the same way, we're pushing the button, but if all of the sudden the middle guy is going a different direction, we have to refrain. So what kind of inhibitory that's an executive functioning type of measure. The card sorting task was another one, and that had to do with again a computer tasks where the students had cards up on a screen, and they originally sort in one way, maybe by color and then they have to come up with a second way, and that looks at cognitive flexibility, which is another executive functioning. Umm… so he looked those types of things, the prosocial, the executive functioning, the self-regulation there was something along the lines of the marshmallow test, where they were told, here's a toy, or here's a piece of candy, and again, over those trials, if you wait, you'll get more, and increasing increments to see what that would look like. 

00:37:35
SHANNON DERMER And then grades you mentioned. 

00:37:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN And then grades, which were given by the teachers. 

00:37:40
SHANNON DERMER Umm… we don't have too much time to spend on this, but can you give us a overview little bit of how you analyze the data, and then what you found? 

00:37:45
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Yes, wlel, so this is a piece that would maybe get overwhelming as a lot of counselors were thinking about it if they weren't in a research setting, but we actually looked at to, to put it very simplistically, we looked at umm… the means between all of the groups before we started in each of the task. We got the average, and we said how are they doing in sharing, how are they doing in their achievement? And there were no differences. And then with the post-task, what we looked at was something called a repeated measure ANOVA where we could look at differences within each of those umm… each of those groups, but again, if we go back to a more simplistic application of it, we could look at simply getting averages of students in terms of sharing before the intervention averages the students and the aftereffect of the program, and comparing and do we just at a very simplistic level see improvement or change? 

00:38:40
SHANNON DERMER So you could, I mean, you could eyeball it, and see is there a difference if you just want to kind of know for… for yourself. There's also, I mean, a lot of simple packages now can do, even Excel can do some basic simple stats for you that are not a big deal where you could get, you know, is there a difference between these two scores, you know, and is it significant? 

00:39:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. 

00:39:05
SHANNON DERMER Umm… as well as you could do much more complex. So just to summarize, and it sounds like you gave the test beforehand and you did not see a significant difference between the two groups and then but then after the mindfulness interventions, what did you see a significant difference? 

00:39:25
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN What we found was in terms of teacher grades, we found very similar findings to what had previously happened in that work with Michelle, and another study that had been done previously. We found improvements in grades in the areas of health, in the area of socialization, and also in terms of learning, so very similar to where it had previously been found that the SAT scores were better that they were ranked as more competent by peers and friends. We saw very similar findings to that. It was also interesting that in the control group, the sharing condition where part of it became that sharing task actually got worse without the intervention. 

00:40:10
SHANNON DERMER Oh. 

00:40:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN So they actually didn't share more as time went along whereas we saw the group that was receiving the intervention doing a little bit better. 

00:40:20
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So not only did the intervention group do better, but the other group who knew now they were going to get stickers actually did… 

00:40:25
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Of course, right. So that speaks to that a little bit in an very interesting way. In terms of executive functioning, which become very important skills in the classroom how am I focusing and attending, we actually saw some improvement around the areas of the cognitive flexibility, which is nice to see, and also in terms of their ability to self-regulate umm… not grab the marshmallow so to speak. 

00:40:55
SHANNON DERMER Good. So thank you. So you're not… there's two great things, you know, not only do we have a great example of research and program evaluation, but also for your particular project with your colleagues you are able to replicate some previous research, and find that mindfulness was… was helpful to preschool age children. 

00:41:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. And then it's a powerful tool not only for prosocial behavior, which we might expect, but also in terms of executive functioning, which is important for academic success and ultimately, in terms of how teachers rated their students with their achievement. 

00:41:30
SHANNON DERMER Well, Thank you for sharing that example. 

00:41:35
RESEARCH & PROGRAM EVALUATION: 

00:41:35
EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 

00:41:35
WRAP-UP 

00:41:35
with Terri Christiansen, Ph.D. 

00:41:35
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:41:40
SHANNON DERMER So, Terri, I got to interview you a little bit about a project that you did some research and program evaluation, and that was really fun to hear about the process of program evaluation, but also the content of mindfulness with little kids, which I'm not sure everyone realizes that you can do mindfulness with, you know, preschoolers. And I do want point out to the people watching that they may think well, I'm not to be a researcher so program evaluation doesn't really… research and program evaluation doesn't really apply to me, but there's been a big push in accreditation standards umm… in algorithms that specifically for CACREP for the counseling ones that that students be able to at least understand if not actually do their own program evaluation at both the master's and doctoral standard level. They're supposed to understand what program evaluation is. 

00:42:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. I think umm… you know, in the school setting is… is the most obvious, glaring example that jumps out. But school counselors play an instrumental role in the schools with setting up programs that are geared towards addressing a variety of social, emotional or behavioral issues, and even just being able to collaborate and be involved with how are we going to approach this? I think that's such an important thing to have as somebody who's worked as a school psychologist. I always valued they're tended to be this will step back and lets you handle the data, and I think having that collaborative process with a social worker, the counselor, everybody is involved with how to making sense of this information, these numbers, and saying how do we umm… evaluate its success or what… where we're wanting to go next. 

00:43:25
SHANNON DERMER Good. And I know that, you know, a lot of times people want to know hey, that it was successful, but they may not think they want to be involved in the process. But we talked about a lot of the skills that you use as a clinician, you also can use in order do a good program evaluation. You can use that curiosity. You can use some qualitative type of things, but mostly it's about… good program evaluation is about answering questions that are important to the people who are involved with the program. 

00:43:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. Very much the same way that we would go about setting measurable goals in therapy. We want to be looking at measurable goals in terms of programs that we implement to help larger groups of kids, and many counselors where they're dealing with a group setting or dealing with larger numbers of students that becomes really important to be able to be a part of that process. And even though the numbers can be intimidating, they are very much equipped with some practice can do a wonderful job in being an active part of that. 

00:44:25
SHANNON DERMER This is something that, you know, almost no clinician, especially ones that are working in the schools like school counselors, but really no clinician can get away from accountability is become… has become such a big part of counseling and therapy, and I think will only continue to do so. So it's something that we have to be able to teach students and supervisees in a way that makes sense to them and that like you said with goals for clients that also motivates them to get involved in it. 

00:45:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. I was just thinking as you were saying that that I had actually watched a continuing education video regarding ethics and ethics training. And one of the things that was brought up is the progression of the field of therapy, and that it is very much part of our ethical obligation to be able to demonstrate that what we're doing has some backing, and so collecting umm… data or umm… waiting in a little bit, even if we start with some very basic ways becomes important to show that we're attempting to be evidence-based, and… and measure what it is we're doing. 

00:45:35
SHANNON DERMER That's a great point. It used to be more or like, oh, we had to be ethically responsible for making sure that we weren't doing something that was harmful. Now it's even more we have to make sure we're doing something that is helpful, not just not harmful. 

00:45:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. We have accountability around umm… there's a higher level of accountability that we've been called to as therapists and counselors since so pulling in measurements related types of information becomes important towards demonstrating that. 

00:46:05
SHANNON DERMER And again when you talked about in the interview, you talked about like yeah, you get really complex with a lot of the stuff. You can use some complex statistics and complex measurement and assessment, you know, models to… in order to collect the information, but they are also can be just something as simple as a, you know, a simple pretest and… and posttest or a simple comparison between a group that, you know, got the program or a treatment and… and a group that didn't. There doesn't had to be huge complex things. 

00:46:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN No, it can be quite simple, and again, what we want to make sure is that we're getting a measure before we start the inov… at the very least, we want to make sure we get a baseline measure well before we start the intervention, and then see where we're at afterwards. Then that becomes important information where if we weren't using that, we could be continuing down that road whereas this gives us some information to reflect on outside of our intuition to help guide where it is we're going. 

00:47:05
SHANNON DERMER And your intuition may be 100 percent right, but you want kind of that data to show that like hey, I knew it, and here is the numbers to help support this. 

00:47:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Certainly. 

00:47:15
SHANNON DERMER We don't prove anything, but we do support things with collecting, and it can be observation. It can be checklist. It could be, you know, tests that we give. It could be a lot of different things that we… that we use to support some of our hypotheses about what is going to be helpful or what is not going to be helpful. 

00:47:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. It makes me think of a saying that goes along the lines of in God we trust everybody else show me your data. 

00:47:40
SHANNON DERMER I like that. I like that because we're going to come on our money anytime soon, and I do like that. Well, what would you say to all the naysayers out there you say, yeah, but you can make the data show anything. Anything you want, you can make the data show. 

00:47:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I think, umm… that's there's probably some truth to that, but before we're staying true to being ethical, and making smart selections around the measures where we have reliable valid measures that we're using to assess things, the reality is… is that we're going to get some honest feedback in those numbers. Umm… I think where we might fall into stick your turf would be where we are just maybe as we're waiting into this process, and we're looking at averages and trying to figure out if it was significant growth or not, umm…. That can get a little bit fuzzier. But umm… the reality is that while we're heading in there, that's still better than not operating looking with any data. 

00:48:40
SHANNON DERMER Well, I'm going to throw something at you that we didn't talk about, and so if you don't want to about this, you know, that's fine, but the difference between umm… statistical significance and clinical significance. Do you want to say anything about that? 

00:48:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN So when, for example, with research program evaluation umm… where we start… we're very much looking at do we have statistical significance. 

00:49:05
SHANNON DERMER I know. 

00:49:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Do we have that statistical significance, and that becomes about running some statistical analysis. It may be a bit more complex, and with that we can say with a bit more certainty, although not absolute 100 percent, right, we also have some margin of error in there with any kind of testing that we're doing. We have error built in, and we didn't really talk about that piece either, but there's always error in our measures. So by doing statistical analyses that's important where we see something umm… that we may feel is clinically significant where we see some movement umm… that's a different way of looking at it umm… than… 

00:49:50
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. But I mean, I think sometimes where it comes when people say, oh, you can make statistics say anything. So if you have a large enough sample, even a small difference can be statistically significant, but it doesn't really make an impact in someone's life. 

00:50:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I see what you are saying. 

00:50:05
SHANNON DERMER Versus I know what you were talking about is oh, we might see something that we really think is clinically significant. But we don't have enough… we haven't done the kind of research we need to, to be able to show that statistically, but also it can go the other way. And that's usually what we think about like oh, I think, I think this works. And I think, you know, it… it's powerful, but we didn't really set up the research to say, oh, there's a statistical difference before and after between these two groups, but it also goes the other way where sometimes our stats can show a significant difference, but it doesn't really have meaning in someone's life. 

00:50:40
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right, absolutely. 

00:50:40
SHANNON DERMER So we need to make sure that both, and I think that's where sometimes the… when you talked about the ethical part of that is that umm… okay, yeah, we show that there was a significant difference. But we want to make sure to go after this step that is going to have meaning to the people that we're working with. 

00:50:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. And hopefully even our in our research programs, you know, we keep that we're mindful of those pieces umm… of saying is, you know, what value is this really bringing? Umm… and is this meaningful in terms of an applied aspect of what that work is? 

00:51:10
SHANNON DERMER And I think that is more in the research field now with institutional research boards that they are looking at, oh, that is this just, you know, some interesting research, but is it going to bring… are we wasting people's time by doing this research? Is something, you know, meaningful going to come out of it if we are having people be involved in this research? And again, that's I think as clinicians we definitely have that always in the back of our mind, you know, how is this going to impact people? Is this worth their time, their energy? And that's part of program evaluation too more so than just basic research. They don't consider that a lot of times basic research, but for program evaluation it's like is this worth the time, money, energy of the people who are involved in this? 

00:51:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. Absolutely. 

00:52:00
SHANNON DERMER Well, thank you so much. I think that's a topic that a lot of students don't think can be fun or interesting, but I think in your interview today you did demonstrate how it can be really interesting to do program evaluation. 

00:52:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. I think we're doing work around things that are important to us, and that we really value it's a nice way of being able to, to look at the impact that it's having aside from what we might experience clinically. 

00:52:25
SHANNON DERMER Good. Thank you. And thank you for joining us for CACREP essential skills for counseling practice. I hope that you have learned how you can do some basic research and program evaluation in your own practice or your own schools. So thank you for joining us.
