RONALD F. LEVANT  Thank you very much and good morning to you, and, ah, thanks for inviting me to spend the morning with you. Uhm, it may seem odd to say this but, ah, there, there are a lot of data that suggests that men in fact may be the weaker sex. Ah, from child onward males appear to be at risk. Infant males are more likely to undergo complications during labor and delivery, and they have more birth defects. Boys often manifest behavioral difficulties and learning disabilities, ah, by elementary school, and by the eight grade, boys are only half as likely as girls to aspire to a profession or career. Boys are nine times more likely to suffer from hyperactivity and attention deficit disorder more than twice as likely to be suspended from school. Ah, and, and by the way, these figures are greater among African-American men. Ah, men are less likely to attend college and the graduate school than women and the gap here also is greater am, among African-American men and women. Compared to young women, young men are four times more likely to be victims of homicide and are five times more likely to kill themselves. Uhm, now, men, ah, we, men, live under a code of masculinity. It requires us to be aggressive, dominant, focused on work, competitive, extremely self-sufficient, adventure-seeking, willing to take risk and emotionally constricted. I think this code takes a, a, a toll on men in terms of their morbidity and mortality. Ah, in terms of the latter, the average life expectancy for males in the United States is 5.3 years younger than that for women, according to the latest figures. I actually have a, I don't need this, I have another mic. Okay, traditional male role traits inhibit men from seeking medical help in the early stages of disease and from being sufficiently attuned to the internal processes to be able to detect early warnings of illness. Ah, Dave Berry, how many know who Dave Berry is? Raise your hand, okay. In his inimitable humor that captures his quality, uhm, in a chapter in his book, as, as, uhm, called, the chapter is called "Special Medical Concerns of the Guy" or "It's Just A Sprain." Doctor: So, what seems to be the problem? Patient: Well, I keep coughing a blood plus I have these open sores all over my body, I also have severe chest pains and double-vision, and from time to time, little worms barrel(ph) out of my skin. Doctor: It's just a sprain. Patient: That's what I thought. Now, uhm, while more women than men currently report psychological distress and attempt suicide, the gap appears to be closing and then IMH (inaudible [00:03:32.849]) study found that all the women show higher rates of their affective anxiety and somatoform disorders, men continue to have higher rates of substance abuse and anti-social personality disorders. In a RAND study, RAND study has demonstrated that depression is not only denied by the men themselves but it goes chronically undetected in primary care. Uhm, now, men who are in need of psychological treatment do not utilize it readily. Six factors appear to stand in the way, why men don't utilize psychotherapy. First of all, it's unmanly to admit that you have a problem you can't handle yourself, you know, I mean it's just simple it is. It's, it causes men to feel ashamed of themselves to, to admit, to admit this. This is what David and Brannon described as a "sturdy oak trait" that men must conceal weakness even from himself. Secondly, there's, men have difficulty in asking for help and this is linked to, ah, ah, one of the normative requirements for extreme self-sufficiency and also men's traditional inability to tolerate dependency on others. Pollock, ah, term, termed this "defensive autonomy." There's also difficulty in identifying and processing vulnerable emotions and carrying emotions. We're gonna be talking a great deal about this, but this is a gender-based form of alexithymia that leads to deficits of emotional intelligence in men who are reared under traditional norms. The fourth is fear of intimacy or the interdependent sharing of vulnerable feelings, often resulting from the traumatic effects of early socialization experiences in boyhood. Fifth, ah, men tend to sexualize everything. I don't know how many of you remember the comedian Lenny Bruce, but he commented about this that men will have sex with anything. If they're on a desert island, there's only mud, they'll have sex with mud. Uhm, but men tend to sexualize encounters with female therapists and they also develop, heterosexual men develop homophobic barriers in intimate encounters with, ah, male therapists. And finally, there's a lack of appropriate psychological and psychotherapeutic treatments designed from respective(ph) that's empathic to men's needs, struggles, and conflicts.

RONALD F. LEVANT  Oh, I missed out one thing. Now, there are some male traits that can be used to facilitate therapy. The ma, the male predilection for thinking things through and being rational, ah, lends itself to cognitive forms of therapy, and men's willingness to take action lends itself to, uhm, forge its therapy that have homework assignments and directs men to undertake certain task. Now, one can conceptualize the designing of psychological interventions and psychotherapy for men as kind of a cross-cultural process. The culture of traditional psychotherapy has required the expression of feelings and behaviors that often can flip with both conscious and unconscious aspects of the traditional male role. Traditional psychological therapies, as you, you know, may recall, were, ah, designed by men to train women, going back to the, uhm, beginnings of psychotherapy with Freud and Broyer.

00:06:55
RONALD F. LEVANT  In the past several decades, feminist scholars have pointed out the flaws underlying some of the assumptions that were, cre, that rose out of the notion that men would design therapy for women, uhm, but this traditional arrangement that has not worked well for women does not also work well for men. It is not taken into account the experience of male patients. So our task is clear, to create psychotherapies and, ah, interventions designed specifically, ah, for men, ah, that are empathic with men. As the field of professionals study, the psychology of men and masculinity, it's still very much in its infancy the Division 51 in APA is, ah, 10 years old this year. But we've began to recognize from a gender-aware perspective and aided by feminist-inspired scholarship the unique socializing and developmental influences that shape the personalities of men and how these influences affect men's life experiences. Uhm, there are several books that are out on this, these are mine, one of, one of the first was "A New Psychology of Men," and uhm, another one is "New Psychotherapy for Men." 

00:08:20

00:08:20
RONALD F. LEVANT  Now, I'm gonna focus on a fairly specific aspect of "A New Psychology of Men." I used this term once before, you probably didn't know what it meant. I'm gonna talk about normative male alexithymia, no, I didn't sneeze, the word is alexithymia. What does it mean? It's, uhm, it's a clinical term composed of some Greco-Roman words, "A" for Without, "lexus" for words, and "thymos" for emotions, so it simply means " without words for emotions." I'm going back and go on with this, take these things over here. Uhm, now, this condition was originally described by clinicians like Henry Krystal and Peter Sifneos to characterize a form of severe emotional constriction that they were encountering back in the 60's and 70's, and they're primarily male psychosomatic PTSD and chemically dependent patients. And they were dealing with extreme, a clinical alexithymia, which is at the far end of the continuum of this, of this disorder. In my work in preventive, beginning in preventive programs, the Boston University Fatherhood Project in the 80's, and continuing to my clinical practice, I came to observe this phenomenon in a milder form that seem to be normative for many men. Thus, I termed it normative male alexithymia. It's a subclinical or shadow syndrome version of alexithymia. Simply put, as a result of the male role socialization process which you're gonna learn about today, men grow up to be genuinely unaware of large aspects of their emotional life. When asked to give an account of their emotional experience, they cannot do what is automatic for many women, which is simply sense in word, feel the feeling, and let the verbal description come to mind. Instead, many men have to logically deduce what the feeling should be under the circumstances. Now, I'm gonna show you a number of comic strips, I want you to understand that this does not reflect my level of scholarship, I actually do read journals and, uhm, by the way, this is being videotaped, these lectures being videotaped by Microtraining, but none of the audience will be videotaped. I'll read the, ah, cartoons and I'll also, if people will ask questions, which you can feel free to ask me at anytime, I'll repeat the question. So, in this comic strip, the wife says to husband, "Can't you sleep?" and he says, "No." And she says, "Is something bothering you?" and he said, "Yes." And she says, "What is it?" He says, "I don't know." Normative male alexithymia, sometimes this characteristic is ridiculed in the comic strips. You know what's frustrating about men? You never open up and share your feelings. Okay, I don't like fancy restaurants, I don't like your hair short, I hate foreplay, I don't wanna go shopping, okay, okay, you've made your point. Now, this next slide is gonna separate out the generation, but there is one man in the 1950's who has a veritable font of emotional expressivity and was able to express a wide range of the emotions from joy and happiness and satisfaction, amusement or lie. I mean, look at these emotions pouring out of this man. This man is Ed Sullivan and his expression remains unchanged in each of these, ah, photos. I first noticed this, I mentioned the Boston University Fatherhood Project, this is where, where I got started in this business, uhm, and, and I, I ran, this is in the early 80's and I ran a project for, at that time, more and more men were becoming involved caring for their children, but finding difficulties in acting that role, and you know, it's fairly obvious that men, uhm, who were adult men at that time were really not prepared to be an involved father, they were pretty much compared to be like their own dads, this idea of, uhm, of ah, of child rearing was to be the chief disciplinarian and, ah, the good provider. So, a lot of men in their, and I was actually among them, I was a non, as a, a, uhm, a semi-custodial divorced father of a girl and we're all struggling. How do you, you know, how do you care for kids, you know? Uhm, how do you get beyond somebody's issues that seem to pop up? And, uhm, growing out of this, I started this, uhm, counseling program ran out of Boston University's preventive program, while the fatherhood project got a lot of publicity at the time 'cause it seemed very unique, but we offered workshops for men that, that wanted to become better fathers, it was called the Fatherhood Course. And in one of these workshops early on, there was a man who said, ah, described how, uhm, ah, his son had stood him up for a father and son hockey game, and since he was a divorced father, he'd been looking forward to this and, and, ah, so, I said, ah, "So, Joe, how did you feel about that?" He said, "He shouldn't have done it," pointing his finger. I said, "Okay, well, I agree, he shouldn't have done it, but how did you feel?" "Feel?" he looked at me blankly. So the way we do this workshop back then is we have, we have, a grant that allowed us to purchase more video equipment than any sane person would ever want. We had video decks and generators and spe, special effects generators and monitors and tripods and cameras coming out of the ceiling and things of that nature and somebody said, "Well, why don't we videotape it and you can role play yourself and, uhm, then you role play his ex-wife as she delivers the news that his son had gone to a Bar Mitzvah, then we'll videotape it, then we'll show it back and you can see how you're feeling," and we did that. And as his face fell into a frown and his shoulders slumped, we said, "Well, well how did you feel?" He, looking intently at the monitor concentrating, "I guess, I guess I felt disappointed, that's it. Disappointed." I guess I felt disappointed with this much coaching? My God, I said to myself, I thought of how, how would a, how would a, a comparable situation with the mother be. I mean, let's say, ah, a daughter stood her mother up for a shopping date. What would she say, how would she respond if I said, "How did you feel?" She said, "Well, first, I was surprised, 'cause it's not like her to act that way and then I was angry that she showed so little concern for my feelings, and now I was kinda worried that maybe she's upset with me about something and this is her way of showing it. And then I was, uhm, disappointed, you know, 'cause I built my whole day around this and now it was ruined." Big difference, right? Well, some would say, "Well of course a woman would carry on like that. Women are more emotional than men." Wrong. As we will see, males have the same capacity for emotional experience and emotional expression as do females, it's just that by the time we reach adulthood, if we're reared in a traditional environment, we have so learned that these feelings are off-limits or shameful or unwelcome, that we've genuinely lost touch with them. As Henry Krystal, a psychiatrist at Michigan State University, wrote: "Alexithymia is a disturbance in which emotions are not differentiated and are poorly verbalized. When alexithymic patients do mention having a feeling and are questioned about it, they're genuinely not able to describe what they're experiencing. These patients often cannot tell if they are sad, tired, angry, or ill. Occasionally, some become aware of vague physical distress in situations where an emotional response would be expected." Now, remember that last point, the vague physical distress, 'cause that's gonna come back when we talk about how do you help men learn to identify their emotions. Now, many men balk at the suggestion that they have anything in common with the severely disturbed patients, but these, these patients aren't really so different from the rest of us as we might think. Consider this example, a man comes home from a rough work, a rough day at work, having been called on the carpet for a mistake that might cause him his job, grabs a beer out of the fridge, sinks into the couch, reaches for the remote, clicks on the television and stares at it blank-faced, all circuits down. His wife comes into the room, concerned, noticing that his eyes twitching, "Honey, are you all right?" His response, "Yeah, sure, I'm just beat." Eyes never leaving the TV. Or this example, man comes home from a good day at work having learned that his promotion has just come through, grabs a beer out of the fridge, sinks into the couch, reaches for the remote, clicks on the TV, stares at it blank-faced, all circuits down, his wife comes into the room, searching his face for clues, "Well?", she says. "I got it," he says, eyes never leaving the TV. "That's great!" she says, he nods, she's confused, "Well, are you happy or not?" He says, "Why, I said it's good, what more do you want me to say?" Hey, do you know these guys? Do any of you know these guys? All right, now, clearly these are examples of a milder form of alexithymia than that observed by Sifneos and Krystal. But like others of my colleagues who specialize in counseling men, I'm continually saddened by how prevalent this condition is and how genuinely unaware men are that it's a problem. In the clinical videotape that you're gonna see a segment of, which is actually this videotape "Men and Emotions," the man is referred to me because his wife thought it was unusual that he had no feelings about the fact that she was pregnant. And he said, "Why don't I usually feel anything?" I asked him when was the last time you cried, he said, "Fifteen years ago when my dog died." Fifteen years was the last time the man cried. "'Cause I normally don't feel anything, is that a problem, Doc?" He didn't think it was a problem, it's normative. From boyhood onward, he was trained that boys, that boys don't cry, that males don't express vulnerability. Now, one of the men in my fatherhood project, uhm, beautifully expressed what the, ah, what the course, the eight-week course had done for him. He said, "Before, it was like I was living life in a black and white television set that had now gone to colored." You know, now, the emotions which were going on in him and around him have suddenly come out and he can see them and experience them. I thought that was a beautiful description. Uhm, as Krystal wrote: "The patients who do not experience their emotions fail to attain a sense of aliveness. And since they don't have emotional signals to guide them, they have to rely on a reason." Now, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with reason that, that would be foolish. However, if reason is our chart book, emotion is our radar. And without that, we'll wind up running into shoals that aren't on the charts, again and again and again. Now, let me contextualize this a little bit. There are differences, not all men are equal and like any trait, you know, there's a bell curve distribution of these traits are out to society. There are cohort differences. This trait was kind of the, the hallmark of the greatest generation, the World War II generation, ah, the strong silent type as epitomized by some of the television icons of that generation like Cary Grant and John Wayne and so forth. In my generation, the Boomer generation, who were reared to be like our dads, but then married those of us are heterosexual, married a feminist women, women who are enclosed by the feminist movement who pushed our notions about gender roles and gender relations. And as a result, we're kind of a transition generation. And I think so many men in my generation is less normative, although we had to overcome early childhood socialization. And then the ah, the divorce revolution generation, those children who were born when the divorces began spiking this country from 65 to reaching the peak around 1980-82 were very likely to have been reared in a female-headed household, very likely to have been reared seeing a mother performing both instrumental and expressive roles, much less likely to have been reared in a traditional way and therefore less likely to be alexithymic. There's also cultural differences. I mean just to take some of their fairly obvious view. When I was in Boston as a clinician, you know, two of the dominant, of ah, ethnic groups were Italians and Irish people. And uhm, I use to treat demurral therapy in one of the most difficult marriages to treat is the Irish-Italian marriage, okay, 'cause the, ah, you know the, ah, to the Italian person is no big deal, you know, to get angry. You blow up and then you kiss and make up. To an Irish person, if you ever say those words, it means the end of the relationship. So it's all these misunderstandings based on cultural variables. So, a northern European man would be more likely to be alexithymic, southern European men permitted more expressivity, same as true with Latin American men and they're all sorts of variations culturally. There's also variations in the degree of the severity of socialization. Now, some men repress, I, I'm sorry, suppress their emotions. They have not been in any way traumatized, but they know the display rules in our society do not permit a man to be overly emotional, so you simply don't show it. Other men repress their emotions. They've been somewhat traumatized as children about the big boys don't cry of ah, business. And others have been severely traumatized to the point that the, the psychological process going on is one dissociation. There's been trauma and there's actual dissociation. So, there's a continuum there of severity. And also, I'm not talking about all emotions, I'm talking specifically about emotions that I call the vulnerable emotions that is emotions that make up a person feel vulnerable like fear and sadness and loneliness and weakness and helplessness and so forth and the caring and connection emotion, the attachment emotions, fondness and affection, and so forth. What emotions are men permitted? You tell me. 

00:24:05
 Anger. 

00:24:05
RONALD F. LEVANT Right. And what other one? It was not really emotion. Lust. Right? That's it. Uhm, okay. So, this inability among men who are reared traditionally to identify emotions and put them into words has enormous consequences. First of all, it blocks such men from use, utilizing the most effective means known for dealing with stress. Whether we're talking about past, you know, minor hassles all the way up to major traumas, the best way to deal with it is to talk about it with someone else. Whether that someone else is a family member, a friend, uhm, a religious counselor or a professional, uhm, uhm, mental health professional. Men who cannot identify their feelings are blocked from this simple way of dealing with stress. Being so blocked, how do men deal with stress? You tell me. 

00:25:05
  Drink. 

00:25:10
RONALD F. LEVANT Drink. What else? 

00:25:10
 Sex. 

00:25:10
RONALD F. LEVANT Sex. Right. What else? 

00:25:10
  Grow tumors. 

00:25:15
RONALD F. LEVANT Pardon? 

00:25:15
 Grow tumors. 

00:25:15
RONALD F. LEVANT Grow tumors. Good, okay. What else? 

00:25:15
 Work, overwork. 

00:25:15
RONALD F. LEVANT Work, overwork, workaholic, right. Anything else? 

00:25:20
 They work out. 

00:25:20
RONALD F. LEVANT They work out, okay. 

00:25:25
 Going into the cave. 

00:25:25
RONALD F. LEVANT Yeah, going into the cave, right. Emotional disconnection. 

00:25:30
 ESPN. 

00:25:30
RONALD F. LEVANT  ESPN, no, let's not go there, okay? That's getting personal, all right. All right, okay. Ah, you've hit 'em all. I mean, there's some others are(ph) violence, I don't know if they made mention that, and of risk-taking behavior, the often leading to accidents, driving accidents, things of that nature. So, men who don't have the ability to identify and put their emotions in words lack the ability to, to talk about things when they're really stressed out. And they, therefore, resort to a variety of other unhealthy means. Another one I would add is somatization which is actually a problem in the patient that you'll see. Now, I hasten to point out by characterizing men's traditional inability to put emotions in words as a mild form or shadow syndrome of alexithymia. I am not trying to pathologize men, I'm a man, I like being man, some of my best friends are men. My daughter married a man, I mean, I don't have a problem with men, okay? Uhm, but I, I do think that this traditional aspect of masculinity is out of date and is, does not serve men well today in our society. Men need to be more emotionally intelligent, not less so. They need to be able to tune into themselves and to other people. We need to stop raising our voice to be little, uhm, you know, Rambos, basically. Uhm, now, uhm, I also by using the word alexithymia, I'm drawing your attention to trauma 'cause those of you who were aware literature know that alexithymia is like a, a major element in the trauma literature. And why am I doing that? Because I want to tell you that I think the male role socialization process is inherently traumatic. Okay, let's talk about that. First a little theory, uhm, the new psychology of men, the major theory that we use is the gender role strain paradigm, which is a social constructionist perspective that was developed by Joseph Pleck, published "The Myth of Masculinity" in 1981. He replaced an older of way of looking at gender called the gender role identity paradigm which basically thought that uhm, males must be masculine for essential personality development and if they weren't, it was a problem. And this particular attitude permeated gender psychology from the 1920's, all the way into, into the 60's. There's a tape that I show sometimes to illustrate this point, it's about group psychotherapy with boys. And ah, its activity group therapy, 14 boys are shown in this group therapy, 11 of them were referred. I think the tape was made in the 50's. Eleven referred for effeminate behavior. And that was the reason for referring boys, nowadays, they don't, you know, they probably all be diagnosed with ADHD, but 11 out of 14 were diag, were, were sent because they thought their parents are teachers, somebody thought they exhibited effeminate behavior. And the fear was that would lead to homosexuality which was at that time considered to be uhm, a, a mental disorder. Uhm, now, the strain paradigm. 

00:29:05
[sil.] 

00:29:05
RONALD F. LEVANT  the strain paradigm essentially says that uhm, it starts off with the ah, notion that in any given society, there's a view of the appropriate roles for males and females and that this view embedded in an ideology, a gender ideology informs how parents socialize children, how teachers relate to kids, and how kids relate to each other. Uhm, it also proposes that, uh, children's personalities don't fit roles particularly well. So, when you try to force, you know, I mean, let's just take any trait, like let's say aggressivity, you know, uhm, boys are not uniformly aggressive nor girls uniformly unaggressive. I mean, it exist most traits of, if you compare males and females, you get two overlapping bell distributions with maybe a small mean difference that may or may not be significant but vast areas of overlap. There are a lot of girls that are more aggressive temperamentally than a lot of boys. But when you say, all boys have to be aggressive and all girls can't be aggressive and you force children into these roles, you strain their personalities. So, this is why it's called the strain paradigm. Uhm, now, I talked about ideology, uh-hmm, the uhm, the traditional masculinity ideology that prevailed in the, from the, around the 1960s in the United States consist of a seven norms. This is drawn from my instrument, the male role norms inventory which I've been using for about 15 years to study ah, the norms of the male role in cultures and subcultures in the U.S. and internationally, consists of seven norms. The first one is avoiding all things feminine. This is a big deal. "Please, Rose, I need a pen," her husband says. She says, "There's, I told you there's one in my purse." He looks and sees the perch, the purse on a chair. He says, "I can't open it." She says, "Bring it to me." So, he picks up the whole chair and carries it up his head. Now, this is serious, this is serious issue. I mean, men are never supposed to touch a purse. In one of my first dates, uhm, I was about 17 and the girl asked me to hold her purse and I had my first full-blown panic attack. (laughs) And she never dated me after that, but ah, she probably made a good a decision, but it was big deal for, for guys, you do not hold a girl's purse. Uhm, the next is the restriction of emotionality which is the core theme I'm talking to you about. The third is an emphasis on toughness and aggression. Fourth, extreme self-reliance. I'm not talking about just normal self-reliance, but as the kind of self-reliance that is expressed in the stereotype of the man who's willing to drive around, lost for hours without asking for directions. Uhm, achievement and status, an over emphasis on achievement and status, needing to be the dominant one, workaholism. A non-relational approach to sexuality, that means that a male does not need to have a relationship with a person and have sex with them nor do they even need to like the person. And finally, fear and hatred of homosexuals, that's the traditional male role norms. And to put these on perspective, uh hmm, I wanna observe that traditional masculinity ideology obviously fits better with harsh social conditions such as prevailed in this country from the industrial revolution through two world wars and a great depression. However, as I said earlier, I don't think it fits today's society as well where emotional intelligence is much more important. Now, as I said the ah, strain paradigm proposes that uhm, gender roles don't fit personalities too well leading to several types of gender role strain. Discrepancy strain results when a, a child feels they don't measure up to the norm and they perceived a discrepancy leading to lower self-esteem, and there are couple of instruments to measure that: the gender role conflict scale and the gender role stress scale. Dysfunction strain is when a man conforms too well to one of the norms. Uh, uh, and I would submit to you normative male alexithymia as an example of that when a man conforms to the restriction of the emotions nor to the point that they can identify their own emotions, I think that's a problem. And then finally, trauma strain. This concept originally came about in relationship to certain groups of men whose socialization was thought to be particularly harsh. Like ah, combat veterans, uhm, men of colour gained by sexual man and athletes. But now, the view has emerged now for about 15 years that actually this applies to ah, all men who are reared in a traditional environment that ah, traditional male socialization, particularly what's called emotion socialization, is inherently traumatic. Now, before we get into that let me ask you a question. If you were doing a study of neonates, these are, these are babies who were just hours after birth and you had a good measure of emotionality, how many of you think the girls would be more emotional, raise your hands? How many of you think the boys would be more emotional, raise your hands? How many don't know? Okay. The boys are more emotional in these studies. So, when we talk about biological differences and, and it really annoys me by the way when the Newsweek has these studies showing, you know, FMRIs of males and females shown emotionally stimulating slides and the females light up more (inaudible ) and the conclusion is, females are by nature more emotional. Well, if a first year student ever said that to me, I'd flunk him because of confusing correlation with causation. There's no longitudal evidence that shows that's how it developed? There's no ruling out of rival hypothesis. And doesn't learning change the brain? But as far as biological evidence, here's biological evidence. There could be no socialization in the first hour after birth that would influence boys to be ah, more emotional than girls, and why would it go in that direction anyway? Uhm, Haviland and Malatesta reviewed data from 12 studies of neonates and what they found is that the male infants are more emotional reactive and expressive than the female counterparts that they startle more easily. They become excited more quickly. They have a lower tolerance for tension and frustration. They become dis, distress more quickly. They cry sooner or more often and they fluctuate more rapidly between emotional states. Uhm, and neonates evidently do not show a wide range of emotional behavior. Cunningham and Shapiro found that infant boys were judged to be more emotionally expressive even when the judges were actually misinformed about the child's actual sex, thus controlling for the effects of stereotyping on the part of judges. And behavioral observational studies show that boys remain more emotional than girls up to a year of age. Weinberg found that a 12-month old boys exhibit a significantly more joy as well as anger, more positive vocalizations as well as fuzziness and crying and more gestural signals directed toward the mother than girls. So, this study is important 'coz it shows a range of emotions, the positive and the negative. Now, what happens? By two years old, despite his natural advantage and emotional expressivity, males learned to tune out and suppress and channel their emotion by the messages they receive. Whereas emotion socialization of females encourages them to remain open to their emotions and express it. Dunn, Bretherton, and Munn found that two-year old females refer to feeling states more frequently than do males. But the most interesting ah, series of studies were those done by Ross Buck of the University of Connecticut. What he did is he showed children emotion, emotionally stimulating chi, a slides. He looked at four- to six-year-old boys and girls and he tried to get them a stimulated emotionally. He videotaped the individual child's face and showed it to that child's own mother. And the dependent measure was whether the mother could guess a slide shown her child by watching her child's face on the monitor. Well, at, uh, thank you. I don't know what's happening, you know, and I'll put something on it, put some chalk on it or something. Uhm, at four years of age, mothers of sons were as accurate as mothers of daughters in identifying the slides showed to their child. But as a child aged, the mothers of the sons became less accurate so that by the age of six, there were significant differences between the accuracy of mothers of sons who are much less accurate than mothers of daughters. So, during the four- to six-year period, boys are learning to suppress the facial expression of emotions. Now, what's happening to boys between the ages of four and six? They're in school. Peer socialization. Messages from teachers. Okay. Now, how can we account for this crossover in male emotional expressivities such that boys start out more emotionals than girls and wind up as adults less so? Levant and Kopecky in the book "Masculinity Reconstructed" proposed that four socialization influences result in the suppression channeling of natural male emotionality. First, mothers tend to work harder to manage their more excitable male infants. I don't believe that this is informed by gender ideology as much as it is informed by the fact that you don't want your child getting over excited going over the edge and, uhm, and, and, and having a, a meltdown. So, there are ah, studies that show that mothers of infants behaved differently with girls than boys. With girls, when the play face games, they would make discrepant faces, so the girls smile, they'll frown, and the girl giggles. With boys, they mirror the boy's expression to dampen down the emotion. So mothers behave differently with sons and daughters in a direction of encouraging them to curve their emotionality. Fathers enter the picture in a big way at the 13th month of life. Studies of traditional dads show that fathers tend not to be that involved with children until they are one year of age and from that point on, they zero in on their sons and spend twice as much time with their sons as they do with their daughters or as the mother does with children of, of either gender in a comparable time period. And what are the fathers doing with their sons? They're teaching them to be men. At 13 months of age, they're sending strong gender messages about what's appropriate for boys. Uh, Langlo and Dillan(ph) found, for example, that preschool boys got the, who got the least amount of attention or affection were those who play with dolls and doll furniture. So the fathers send a very strong message to their sons and we'll see more about this later on. Both parents participate in the gender differentiated development of language for emotions. Uhm, parents discourage their sons learning to express vulnerable emotions such as sadness and fear while they encourage daughters to learn to express vulnerable and caring and attachment emotions such as warmth and affection. What emotion do they discourage their daughters from expressing? Anger, right. You read the book. You're right. Uhm, finally, sex segregated peer groups complete the job. Young girls typically play in small groups of two's and three's where the play consist of conversation, and the goal is to kind of ah, maximize cooperativeness and feelings of inclusion, minimize conflict, and as a result, girls learn skills of emotional empathy, emotional self-expression, uh, the resolution of differences. How do boys play? Boys play in large groups and teams in games that are competitive, that involve rules and lots of action. Okay? So, uhm, and of course, boys never, never play with dolls, my God, uhm, dolls, that would just be unheard of. So, in this little cartoon, the girl says, "Hey, Kevin, do you wanna play with my dolls?" "Yuck! Boys don't play with dolls." "But I've seen you play with dolls." "Those are action figures, not dolls! Action figures!" "Hey, Kevin, do you wanna play with my action figures?" "Okay." So it's all how you call it. Now, the suppression and channeling of male emotionality has a number of important facts. Uhm, first is the development of a unique type of empathy that I call action empathy, normative alexithymia which is the central theme of this talk, the overdevelopment of anger and aggression, and the channeling of caring and connection emotions into sex, and also and at the fifth, the, uh, disconnection in relationships.

00:43:10
RONALD F. LEVANT  It's well-known that men are less emotionally empathic than women. Studies have shown that while men are equally as good as women in the cognitive aspects of empathy that is identifying the other person's perspective, they are less good at knowing what emotion the other person is experiencing. So in this, uh, cartoon, husband and wife in bed, husband says, "Laura, are you okay? You know, you seem distant." Facing the pillow, she says, "I'm trying to fall asleep." He says, "Gee, I mean earlier." Eyes are three quarters mashed, she says, "Gee, I can't imagine." He says, "Getting your hours at work cut back and it had me worried about finance and sure make me distant." Unimpressed she says, "I see." And pleased with himself and they say men aren't perceptive. So I will say this is, uh, an example of a, not an example of empathy. Now empathy can be defined as, in terms of interpersonal understanding, the ability to decenter from your own preferences, see things from another person's perspective. Uhm, emotional empathy also involves the vicarious ah, experiencing of the other person's emotion to know how they feel when they're in that situation. And if, as we've been saying, males are socialized to not be attuned to their own emotions, how in the world are they ever gonna be able to vicariously experience the other person's emotion? Well, the answer is they won't. But in the other hand, we males are, are trained to figure out what we see within another person's perspective is, what they will do. This is what's called action empathy. The focus is on what will a person do if they're in that, if they're in that situation. Boys learn this in a variety of ways often on the football field or the sports fields. Uhm, when I was, uhm, in high school, I played football, uh, I wasn't very good I was in the part of the B team or whatever it's called, but nonetheless, I played and the coach would show us, uhm, films at that time of the opposing team and he would teach us non-verbal behaviors. Look, when the quarterback, uh, drops his shoulder to the right, that often means he's gonna make a play right over the right guard. So, you'd learn to read behavior and figure out what people are doing and this is a valuable skill, action empathy. But it gets us into a lot of trouble with the women in our lives. So in this cartoon, wife holding a scrawny little flower says, "My flowers were pathetic this year," she says to her husband, "I can't do anything right." Okay. Now, what would've been a good response, empathic response there? Tell me. Okay. Yes, you can. His response, "Well, maybe if you watered, fertilized and weeded them," okay, see and then her, uh, ah, facial expression suggests that she's not too happy with that and he picks that up and says, "We're talking apples and oranges again, aren't we?" That's action empathy. He's figuring out what she should do. He's not getting at, "Oh, you poor dear, you must feel horrible." You know, he's not connecting to the emotional level. Now, normative alexithymia is a predictable result of the male role socialization process and, uh, what time does this go to? 

00:46:35
 Eight. 

00:46:35
RONALD F. LEVANT Okay. Uhm, specifically, as a result of the requirement that boys restrict the expression of their vulnerable and caring and connection emotions that's shown in the next slide. This is the cartoon that shows a little boy with his face looking a little bit like that painting, uh, by Edvard Munch called "The Scream," do you remember that one? Okay. That was the one that was stolen and hasn't come back. Skoalie(ph) stung his hand catching a baseball yesterday, his mother says, "He has been holding back a cry for 24 hours." The mother's friend says, "Does he realize how he looks?" The mother, "Real men are not overly concerned about their appearance." 

00:47:25
[sil.] 

00:47:25
RONALD F. LEVANT  Now, the socialization process includes the creation of skill deficits by not teaching boys emotional skills and also punishment as prohibitions against, uhm, expressing, uh, vulnerable emotions. Uhm, the mechanism of action in many cases is shaming the boy, making the boy feel ashamed of himself for being weak, you know, for crying, uhm, and, ah, or showing fear. And what this tends to do to a boy is it makes him ashamed of himself when he has those feelings, and he knows he has to suppress them and it puts him at odds and alienates him from his own natural emotional expressivity. 

00:48:15
[sil.] 

00:48:15
RONALD F. LEVANT  Now, uh, the next consequence is the overdevelopment of anger and aggression and boys are allowed to feel and become aware of emotions in the anger and rage part of the emotional spectrum. In fact, this is the one permitted emotion for boys. And as a result, men express anger more aggressively, uh, than do women and, uhm, in fact, the outlawed vulnerable emotions tend to get funneled into the anger channel. Uh, Don Long wrote ah, about what he called the male emotional funnel system. The final common pathway for all those shameful vulnerable emotions which it is too unmanly to express directly. Now, I actually believe that the process is more active than that. I think that, uh, we boys, learn as children to transform the energy associated with the vulnerable feeling into aggression. When a boy pushes this down on the playground, we know we can't come back up with a face full of tears. Instead, we got to come back up with our fist swinging. So we take that fear and we take that sadness and we take that emotional energy and we roll it up into a big fist and we throw it at whoever is harming us. And this is why so many adult men flash into rage when their, when their, when their feelings are hurt, when their feelings are hurt rather than saying, "Gosh, that really hurt my feelings," or crying. They get enraged like a, like a mashed magnetism(ph) in some men. So men tend to transform, boys, I should say, learn to transform their vulnerable feelings into aggression. Video? 

00:50:15
[sil.] 

00:50:15
RONALD F. LEVANT  This is, uh, Andy Sipowicz, one of my favorite traditional male characters in NYPD Blue. All right. Transforming vulnerable feelings into aggression. Okay. Andy Sipowicz is, uh, such a great traditional male character. Uhm, you know, he's obviously worried about his wedding and instead, what does he do? He displaces those feelings, transforms in an aggression and directs it verbally at the citizens that, you know, he's been interacting with as he's been canvassing a crime scene. So, uh, there are lots of examples of this. Now the, the next, uhm, the next, uh, consequence is the transforming a suppression of, uh, caring and connection emotions and their re-emergence into sexuality. Boys experience very sharp limitations on being able to be caring. Uhm, many adult men recall that their first experiences with this, of this was in, uh, connection with their father. Uhm, it was, it was fairly typical in the post-war era for fathers to stop expressing affection to boys about the time they went to school for fear that they would effeminize them or, or, you know, uh, uh, make them into sissies. So, uhm, in, uhm, Family Circle Magazine, there was a little article in father zone where the son, no, I'm sorry, the son is 6 years old, was tucked in bed by his mother and he asked for his father and his father came in and said, "Good night, Billy." And Billy reached out for a goodnight hug and the father responded stiffly, "No, Billy, men don't hug and kiss." So a lot of adult men that I work with in the Fatherhood Project would recount stories similar to this, uh, that their fathers abruptly withdrew affection from them in an age that the father considered the son too old for that stuff. Halfway, I think this has changed, but I see many, uh, young fathers who has freely expressed affection to their sons as well as their daughters. Now, young boys, uhm, also get the message from their peers that it's not socially acceptable to express affection from or receive affection from their mothers lest they'd be thought of as mama's boy. And you know what happens to a first grader who shows affection toward a girl. My God, they get teased mercilessly. You know, Johnny loves says, yada-yada. Any of you remember that? 'Cause I was doing one when I went to that elementary school. Uh, anyway, and of course, with boys, anything but a cool buddy-type relationship gives rise to the dreaded accusation of homosexuality as shown in this slide. Two little boys passing each other in the street. The mother says, "Why didn't you and Clems(ph) say hello to each other?" Son says, "We did." Little sister says, it was a guy hello. Oh, yeah, I forget, guy hellos are silent, quarter-inch nods. 

00:53:10
[sil.] 

00:53:10
RONALD F. LEVANT  Now, later in adolescence, the experience interest in sexuality suddenly accelerates due to the combined effects of hormones and culture. Boys become aware of their sexuality experience, uhm, their first orgasm or semenarchy, either through nocturnal emissions or through masturbation, and they become intensely interested in the release of their sexual urges prevailing cultural images of females as sex objects. Ah, for heterosexual, boys give boys the emerging objectification of girls a cultural imprimatur acting on messages from peers and the cultural large adolescent boys develop the need to prove themselves by, quote, end quote, scoring with girls or lying about it. Adding an additional layer of self-involvement with further serves to, uhm, undermine the relational aspect of sexuality. Boy's deficits in emotional empathy, uhm, reinforce the self-involved objectification of girls by preventing boys from realizing how it might feel to the object of their lust. And the long-suppressed caring and connection emotions gets swept along in this turbulent stream, but well outside of awareness. And as a result, sexuality for boys becomes at a contest level unconnected and non-relational, self-involved, narcissistic. It's a trophy, it's a, it's a badge of honor, uh, but it doesn't end endue(ph) with feelings about the partner. 

00:54:45
RONALD F. LEVANT  Michael et al in the famous Chicago, University of Chicago, "Sex in America Study" found that only half as many men reported that affection for their partner was the reason for having sexual intercourse for the first time. Now, throughout adolescence, this caring, the caring and connection emotions remain an underground, unconscious aspect of the sexual experience reinforced in this position by the (inaudible ) results from violations of the traditional male code. Later in adulthood, the, ah, care and connection emotions begin to surface taking the form as described by most men that I've worked with, uhm, and the, the man in the videotape, says this, but I don't know if you'll see that segment, a feeling most closely connected to their wives when making love and it's not about the physical act of making love, but it's only in that act that the men can let down the defenses enough to feel an emotional connection. 

00:55:50
[sil.] 

00:55:50
RONALD F. LEVANT  So, male sexuality has been kind of commented on in the comic press. Let's see. Okay. Uhm, husband and wife talking. The woman says, "That's silly." Husband, "No, it's true, men think about sex differently than women." "Okay, how do men think about sex?" "Constantly." Constantly? Yeah, you see, you don't have any idea what you're up against there. And then this one goes on, constantly? Now, you always wanna talk about these things, but you're telling me men think about sex constantly. Well, not constantly, how can I explain? Sex is the default setting on the male computer. But it is true if you look at all the literature. Men are far more likely than women to engage in casual sex. They, ah, young men think of, do you think about sex constantly? Ah, much more frequently than do women and so on. All right. Now, so here is the emotion wheel. Uhm, Kennedy picks the results of traditional socialization where a man get anger and aggression and lust and women get the vulnerable emotions and the attachment emotions. 

00:57:20
[sil.] 

00:57:20
RONALD F. LEVANT  Now, there's also, as a result of this emotion socialization process, right, oh, thanks. Oh, thank you, Fred. As a result of this emotional socialization process, uhm, men have difficulties in emotional intimacy. Ah, Stephen Bergman who wrote a chapter on our book, "The New Psychology of Men," talked about male relational dread and he says that emotional intimacy never, can never feel as good to as men as it does to women. And you see this commented on in the comic strips, and this is obviously a serious topic which we're gonna spend a long time about, but we're not gonna have time in regard to heterosexual relationships. So the, they're in marital counseling, Boopsie and Biddy, this is from, uhm, Doonesbury. Boopsie: "Biddy, I think what you're gonna have to do to save your relationship is basically build an entirely new one. You both have to admit, you're different people now. You have to rediscover each other, just imagine for a moment that you've just met. Look at your mate through fresh eyes, pretend that you're seeing each other for the first time. Ah, Boopsie, wow, I'm picking up a very special." Her husband, "Yo, who's the chick with the cowabungas?" I'm not sure what that term means, I think it's a military term. 

00:58:55
[sil.] 

00:58:55
RONALD F. LEVANT  And then, ah, in this one, romance novels for men. Well, they're more like short stories really. You'll see this in, ah, father-son relationships. The father says to son, "Hey," son says back, "Hey, father, are you good?" Son: "Yeah, I'm good, you?" Father: "About the same, good." That was fast. Well, our heart-to-heart don't last as long as they used to. And then men-to-men relationships, this is from Dilbert, uhm, so one guy says to other guy, you should've seen that fish and the other guy stretches his arm out and says, that's nothing compared to the fish I caught. And then Dilbert walks in the room and he still got his arms outstretched and says, "Hi, Dilbert." Dilbert thinks to himself, "He wants to hug me, that's strange." Okay, I'm a '90s guy. Hi, boss, and he gives him a hug. No, to hug this guy seemed awkward. Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you, and both of them freaked out said, "Well, I'm glad, we're both up grown the uptight 80s. Okay, what is the empirical status of all these stereos? Well, I've reviewed some of the literature on, on, ah, the development of psychology literature for you, and it seems to me that there's, uhm, significant, ah, by and I've only reviewed kind of, ah, a small part of it. But, it seems to me there's a substantial literature that suggests that between the ages of four and six, boys are, the, I should say the, between the age of two and six, boys who are systematically socialized do not express, ah, vulnerable and, and caring emotions. And I haven't seen any evidence that shows that, ah, that provides a counter for that at this point in time. 

01:01:00
RONALD F. LEVANT Uhm, in terms of, ah, we think also that if there's normative male alexithymia, you should be able to see this in measures of alexithymia. Now, there, there is, ah, a number of measures of clinical alexithymia, the most widely used is the Toronto Alexithymia Scale developed by Taylor at the University of Toronto. And that instrument has been used in, ah, a large number of studies, and when you separate the studies out between those done in a psychiatric or medical population and those done with college students, you find some very interesting things. The studies done on college students, ah, the males wind up scoring higher on alexithymia than the females in nearly every study, nearly every study. Do they score in, in a clinical range? No, but they score higher than females on an alexithymia scale. In the clinical studies, there are very few differences which makes sense 'coz we're dealing with psychiatric populations where clinical alexithymia is often a part of it, and it doesn't have to do with gender. Recently, I, I and Glen Good and some others have developed a normative male alexithymia scale and our preliminary validations suggest, and this is to try to measure this milder form, suggests that this is a reliable evaluative measures. So, I think, there are data that support this. There has not been a stratified random study of the population in United States or any of that. That may come in the future. 

01:02:30
RONALD F. LEVANT  Okay. What I'm gonna do at this point is show you a clinical vignette, uhm, of some of the work I've done. 

01:02:45
RONALD F. LEVANT The tape that we showed is a clinical tape in which an actor portrays an actual client that I saw. The client was referred to me, uhm, by his wife because he couldn't go, did not feel anything about the fact that, ah, she was pregnant and this concerned her. And in this tape I showed, ah, the fifth session of therapy of a brief therapy that lasts in three or four months in which I, ah, taught the gentleman to use an emotional response log as a way of learning to develop emotional self-awareness. Uhm, in keeping this log, he described an incident where, uhm, he had missed a morning crap report, ah, he's a commodities broker and that, ah, as a result of, uhm, an automobile repair company letting him down, and as a result, he disappointed some important clients. And he described how he felt through his emotional response log in which he wrote his emotions down. And the first emotion wrote down was anger. 

01:03:50
RONALD F. LEVANT Now, as I've been saying in a lecture that anger often is a way of, ah, often results from transforming vulnerable emotions. I tried to get him to identify the vulnerable emotions underneath the anger. And, as we explore it, he indicated that he was disappointed. He, the anger was directed as grudge for not having his car ready and underneath that was a sense of disappointment and being felt, feeling as always left down, let down by the grudge 'coz he'd given these folks a lot of business over the years and he expected better treatment. And, the next emotion he put on his log was stress. And in, ah, and the stress was about not, ah, having that information and laying his clients down and in exploring that, ah, underneath that word "stress" which is emotion, many men will say they have, but as you know, stress is not an emotion. Ah, but in his case underneath that was a feeling of fear that now he's maybe, he's afraid now, maybe his clients were gonna fire him as a result of, ah, this, this incident. This gentleman, when he experiences a lot of stress, he tends to have psychosomatic symptoms and, uhm, particularly gets stomachaches, headaches, and stiff neck, and he had all three of those that morning. And, but in the process of talking about and identifying the, the vulnerable emotions underneath, ah, the feeling of anger and the feeling of stress, he was able to experience and acknowledge in the interview that, that he experienced some relief that helped him feel a little bit better to know what he was feeling. But then, he raised the question, okay, well, I can identify this appointment and I can identify fear and I can identify 18 other emotions, but he still got a situation to deal with, and we discussed then. I told him that that was a very good question that, obviously, knowing what it is that you're feeling doesn't solve the problem. However, it does put you in a better position to deal with the problem because you're not spending a lot of time being angry at the garage, and you're not spending a lot of time trying to deal with stress symptoms, perhaps, by drinking or other things that, that people tend to do to deal with stress. But instead, you can focus on your clients and what you need to do there. So, ah, so, he could see that point. We talked about the possibility of utilizing, ah, ah, this process with, in his relationship with his wife that, uhm, that she might be a person he could talk to about daily hassles and stressors like many, many expressed great (inaudible ) about this, ah, thinking that his wife would, would, ah, ah, not want him to appear less than rock solid and, and, and strong, ah, and, ah, and, you know, and she may not. But, it is a question for him to discuss with her. 

01:06:40
RONALD F. LEVANT Ah, the other thing I would say, you know, he was a fairly healthy client. Uhm, I think I probably gave him a V Coder in adjustment disorder on the (inaudible )for 1500 form. Uhm, and he also, I picked him, ah, this is an actor by the way, but he was fairly, uhm, close to the case. Uhm, and that kind has to do with how we pick, the actors as we have them on audition by, ah, responding to an interview that I designed, and I tried to pick somebody that I thought had a very similar issue to the client rather than, uhm, other features. And I thought this man did. And if you see the whole tape, you'll see, ah, what he's able to do with his emotional self-awareness that he continue to develop. It turns out that a major reason why he didn't feel anything about his wife being pregnant was because he had a whole bunch of unresolved feelings about his own father in particular on the top as you would guess a lot of rage. But then, underneath that rage, a lot of grief. But, by being able to become more emotionally self-aware, he's able through the course of therapy to work through those feelings and, ah, and be able, and, and had an outcome that actually I rarely achieved in therapy where he actually felt like he could exonerate his father. He could see, he was able to, by connecting with a figure from his father's past, uhm, help with his, his father's behavior in some perspective and came to feel like his father did the best with what he could. Of course, with all of our patients, you know, we try to get him the point, if you're upright on this model therapy, I don't know, but I, I try, I always get into the point where they can kind of let go of all the things from the past, and a lot of them have grievances about their families, and as rare that somebody can get to that point where they actually can exonerate, uhm, a parent. This was also a patient that was extraordinarily a compliant. 

01:08:45
RONALD F. LEVANT  Ah, you know, Peggy Papp, Papp has written about compliance-based and defiance-based patient who was striking with little resistance. There was no substance abuse, this is a real, you know, healthy man relatively, and I chose him for this purpose 'coz I thought it would illustrate a kind of the processes I want to illustrate which is how do men become emotionally self-aware without dealing with things that you would see in any other videotape, which is how do you deal with the resistance and, and so on. So, there's a very limited resistance, ah, in this, in this interview. He kind of does what I tell him, of course, he's really, he was a treat, he was just like that, that client. 

01:09:20
RONALD F. LEVANT I was trained in Boston, and the story about Boston is that Freud when he came to Western, ah, came to Boston, everyone for the Western was when we got back to Boston, we never got back on the boat. And, you know, when you're trained in Boston, ah, you're trained psychoanalytically, okay. I mean, I can't escape that. That's how I was trained. And I think those things are a shame that, uhm, a lot of that seems not to be a part of our training programs today. 

01:09:45
RONALD F. LEVANT A lot of my referrals came about through wives or, ah, through, ah, female colleagues. We're seeing women, ah, who are complaining about their husbands. Uhm, so, where I go with most of these men is they started off with an assessment. I have a series of question, I didn't go through it here. I have a series of questions, ah, trying to see to what extent their alexithymia, and I asked him a series of questions in just, as part of my initial interview. And if I find that they have some degree of it, then I will go through five steps psychoeducational approach. This was, ah, the fourth step of it, but it involves, ah, teaching them to read emotions and get helping them develop vocabulary of emotions, teaching him to read the emotions in other people, applying this emotional response log for themselves, and then practicing. 

01:10:35
RONALD F. LEVANT My practice was, uhm, kind of, ah, an outpatient, uhm, sort of a, uhm, top-end(ph) practice. Ah, the men were typically doctors, lawyers, stock brokers, you know, and, uhm, ah, they were often referred for relational problems and behavior problems at work like substance abuse or angry rages and things of that nature. So, I didn't see a lot of medical patients. Uhm, I did see some, uhm, and, but chronic pain wasn't prevalent. 

01:11:05
 Just going back to the previous question in that last video. 

01:11:10
RONALD F. LEVANT Thank you, it's a good question. She mentioned the, uhm, for those who didn't hear the importance of treating the system and bringing the partner. And, and, ah, I've fit... (crosstalk) 

01:11:20
 (inaudible ) 

01:11:22
RONALD F. LEVANT ...when that's requested. In this case, that was not requested, but I, uhm, have treated couples, ah, who come in with very similar problems and, uhm, I sometimes do psychoeducation for both of them. And what kind of psychoeducation you might ask what I do for the female. Well, uhm, ah, whereas males, uhm, tend to be socialized, uhm, toward emotional constriction, ah, some, sometimes females are emotion, are, are socialized towards emotional rumination, and, yeah, being emotionally floated.(ph) But, they can go through a similar emotional self-awareness, kind of, ah, psychoeducational program that would enable them to, uhm, manage their emotions more effectively. So, I think of a couple that I saw would, uhm, ah, sort of a, ah, high-flying academic, very successful couple, and then they had a great relationship until their first child was born. And after that point, everything went to hell in a hand basket. And, ah, the husband got freaked out, and went on a six-week business trip, six weeks into the Orient, left away for long. Wife had serious abandonment issues 'coz her, her own mother was an addict. So, you could imagine what this did to her and she, she described herself as going to the shower in triumphful(ph) blast and screaming at the top of her lungs 'coz she was filled with rage. Ah, when I saw the couple, the husband, uhm, was literally shaking so much, so then when I try to focus on them, I would get nystagmus. And I asked him how he's feeling? Fine. Are you getting a little anxious? No. And, I think he just was so out of touch with his emotions. It was so obvious. Anybody looked that the man was shaking in shoes, but he couldn't acknowledge it. And this was a couple who had child care problems. So, there were often sessions where one or the other one came rather than both of them giving me an opportunity to do psychoeducation with each of them as it kind of haste into the therapy. So, I've used this method individually with couples and with groups.

RONALD F. LEVANT The men become less afraid of violating the male code after they have achieved the certain level of success in their lives, and they no longer, uhm, you know, worried that they're not gonna be seeing this manly. I mean, this is something that we pick up as boys. And so as we age, you know, it tends to burn off and we tend to be less afraid of it. Yes.

RONALD F. LEVANT  That's a very good point. I'm sorry, I didn't pick up on it. But, this is a good time to come back with a question as how do women, ah, in relationships, ah, react to men when they expressed vulnerabilities and the comment just made was that, ah, women can be very vulnerable about it and some can react very negatively. And, and I think, that's correct. I think it depends on the situation. I think it's pretty though common for men to fear it regardless of what the likely reaction is, and they don't, they don't, ah, have any data, but they just assumed that their wife expects them to be the strong, you know, ah, ah, you know, the strong type and do not show any vulnerability even if that's not true. Uhm, in our, ah, fatherhood, going back to our Fatherhood Project, it was Gregg Doyle's (inaudible ). We did a study 'coz we were warned that, ah, a very similar dimension that, uhm, you know, if you train fathers to become more skillful, and they're, they're getting more involved in childrearing, the, the mothers are not gonna like it 'coz they tend to be gatekeepers about child care. So, we built in a few measures. We, you know, we wanted to, we interviewed the husbands and wives. We gave the children various tasks and we found that, uhm, this was, uhm, this was not a randomized clinical trial with two convenient samples, so there are limitations with the design. But nonetheless, we did not find that to be the case that the mothers tend to, the fathers tend to develop skills, the kids could see the skills relative to the comparison group, and the wives were happy that their husband were more involved. But, I agree with you. It, it, it's not to be taken for granted and, and some women are quite ambivalent about it, about the issue. Other comments or questions? I, well, thank you very much. You've been a terrific audience.
