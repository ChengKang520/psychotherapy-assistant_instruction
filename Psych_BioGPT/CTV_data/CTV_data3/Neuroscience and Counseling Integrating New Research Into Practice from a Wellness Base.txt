ALLEN IVEY Neuroscience and counseling. You are the cutting edge. Counselors in training, therapists in training now are the cutting edge. We now know new things that are gonna change our practice markedly over the years. So, I really welcome you to this, pre, presentation. And you are cutting edge. You are going to have a very different future, a very different professional experience than I had. 

00:00:20
Brain plasticity Neurons and neurotransmitters and counseling's impact on brain growth Brain structure--social brain emphasis THE PRACTICAL--COUNSELING IMPLICATIONS Microskills & counseling's impact on the brain Stress and social justice implications Wellness counseling and introduction 

00:00:20
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, where are we going today? Ah, why neuroscience? I think I've just said because this is the future and cutting edge of our field. Ah, at present, ah, I know of nobody teaching any courses in neuroscience. Ah, I just completed the first presentation on neuroscience the American Counseling Association has ever had. So, this is material, it is just starting, obviously, just starting to enter the field. Neurons and neurotransmitters are really a critical part of our counseling practice now. You're already working on neurons and neurotransmitters. You're just, most of you have not thought of it in that fa, fashion. And so, that's the first area we're going to cover. Then, we're gonna look at the brain structure, ah, particularly, an emphasis on the limbic system, the social brain. And that's where counseling and therapy really takes effect. One of the big surprises for me as I've moved into this area is, not, it's actually not a surprise, is that most of what we're doing, I'd say at least 95 percent of what you're learning in counseling and therapy courses right now is accurate. And it's amazing how well we have done without the basis of neuroscience and biology. So, it doesn't change anything you already know, by in large, but it does give you I think some extra strength for your practice. Ah, then, we're gonna go to some very specific counseling implications that we can think about and making a difference for our students, ah, our students, our clients, our patients, those with whom we work, kids in school. This is implications all over the place for the change in our practice. Ah, then I'm going to get very specific. Ah, my work in microskills, counseling skills, I think there's, each microskill I think has specific implications for, ah, neuroscience and work on the brain. So, we can get fairly precise in terms of anticipating. Some of that work I'm presenting is speculative. But on the other hand, it's, it certainly shows a lot of promise at the same time. Ah, we will spend some time on stress and social justice. And, what about, uhm, biology and, ah, multicultural issues? If anything, I would say that neuroscience strengthens the importance of being aware of multicultural issues, issues of gender, ah, et cetera, because we need to consider, particularly is the statement I'll be saying again is, ah, poverty, abuse of children poisons the brain likely for a lifetime. And this means that you don't just counsel. That means we have to start talking about social justice, action in the community. We need to talk about children's, ah, physical health as well as their mental health. Ah, so, it's really essential that we take a different approach to our field in the future. Ah, now, I've already said that if you don't, ah, microskills and counseling impact on the brain, stress and social justice. I'm going to end with an emphasis on wellness and, ah, what, and, ah, the impact of wellness, another area that we're not giving nearly enough attention to in counseling. Moving to the second slide, our field is changing day by day. And, in particular, neuroscience is changing day by day. So, you've gotta take what I'm saying here as going to be wro, a certain percentage of it's gonna be wrong, just like a large percentage of what you're taking now is wrong as well. You're going to learn, ah, the real learning takes place after you get- 

00:04:15
Disclaimer Field is changing day by day--and this information will change as new developments arise. Not the first attempt to show how neuroscience impacts therapy, but perhaps the first in counseling First major attempt to be clear for beginners in the field and first book to use neuroscience THE BRAIN IS HOLISTIC AND INTERACTIVE 

00:04:15
ALLEN IVEY - out of graduate school. Ah, varying interpretations of brain functions constantly appear. Things are changing constantly. So, it's an area where you gotta really keep up with the literature. Ah, a lot of times, you're gonna see stuff, some pop stuff written that is interesting, but they'll take one study and they'll magnify it and give it more credits student(ph) likely needs to have. So, you're going to see something weekly on the news and in the papers. Read it, note it, and then try to get, get to the web and try to get to the source and see what's really going on. Ah, now, this is not the first attempt to show how neuroscience works, ah, in counseling and therapy. A fellow by the name of Graw, ah, a German Swiss that did fantastic work, unfortunately, he died young. His book is here for you to look at, by far in a way, ah, the most impressive piece of work that existed. Ah, there are other things that help, but this is the first attempt I think to take very sophisticated difficult concepts and then simplify them for people just starting out on the field. So, anything I say today has been reduced to kinda the bare essentials. And your task then is to use that as a skeleton to go out and add new things too. And then, if you don't like these ideas, tomorrow is likely gonna change them anyway. Ah, so be ready to be flexible. Ah, real critical to mention is there's a tendency to say, "This part of the brain does that, this part of the brain does that. Ah, the hypothalamus does this, the thalamus does that." Yes, they do, but everything is interactive in the brain. There is no one single spot that really doesn't, that really can be identified as having a specific function. Merzenich, ah, is a person that stresses this most clearly and strongly. That doesn't mean we don't want to get into the specifics just like counseling has a lot more than specific skills. And yet as you learn about these specific skills, you're gonna become more educated- 

00:06:30
Provides biological/environmental base of our interventions Counseling changes the organization of the brain--a learning process Neuroscience leads to more emphasis on prevention and wellness Most of what we are doing is correct 

00:06:30
ALLEN IVEY - and more effective. So, why neuroscience? Quickly, I've said this in a sense already, biological/environmental base of our in, interventions. We don't have that now. We use kind of a cognitive base. We need to look at what is biology have to say to our work as well. Ah, critical is the idea that counseling changes the organization of the brain. Counseling is a learning process. Okay, one of our failures to date in counseling and therapy is we don't pay any attention to classical learning theory. This needs to become part of our curriculum. The educators, the educational psychologists know a lot about learning theory, that counseling is a learning process. Counseling changes the brain. It's a learning process. We need to know a lot more about learning theory. We have handicapped ourselves by not getting into that area of learning theory. Ah, neuroscience and biology, you think here we're gonna be just focusing on biology and we're, that's, means just meds. Every neuroscientist I've talked with, of course I'd probably, ah, have a selection of people I talk with... 

00:07:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:07:45
ALLEN IVEY ...ah, focuses on the environment, becomes more important rather than less important. In counseling, we tend to do an eye focus, with insufficient attention many times to environmental conditions. Once you get into neuroscience you're going to think, "My goodness, I have really gotta pay a lot more attention to situational factors, not just what's going on in, in the individual. The classic example, ah, I think, which has both counseling and medical issues, is an African American with hypote, hypertension, high blood pressure. What can we do in that area? Okay, we can give meds. And what you do with meds is you lay the problem on the client. Ah, and, ah, we know it's a serious problem 'coz African Americans have a lot of heart problems, lot of issues, may even die sooner because of that hypertension. But where does the hypertension comes from? It tends to come from a constant rub of racist incidents that happen in our society, a constant rub of racist instance in our society. So, if you should be in a medical clinic and counseling an African American that has hypertension, not to consider the social, historical, contextual issues of racism, basically, I would say is in an unethical approach. Ah, the neuroscientific approach says we've got to think about what does the environment do to the body, what does the environment do to the body. And, as counselors and therapists, we can do an awful lot to help a person's body by effective counseling and psychotherapy.

Monkey finger skills led to larger brain area (one day!) Humans brains do the same via counseling Weiten, 2008. Reproduced with permission from Cengage 

00:09:15
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, brain plasticity and neuroscience, neurogenesis, is my next slide. And this is the point the grain, the brain grows new neurons and connections throughout life. And others, even I, at my age, can grow new neurons. I learned way back in Intro Biology, and even up to five years ago, "Hey, I was losing neurons all the time." Now, we've got real clear evidence that even old guys like me can learn new things. So, there's hope. Also, by the way, in your future practice, there are gonna be an awful lot of old people, senior citizens that you're going to wanna work with. And guess what? Me, ah, assuming that Medicare doesn't collapse, that's where the dollars are going to be. So, if you're not giving special attention to older people, you're missing a very important part of your practice. Ah, and the things, again, we need to think again about balancing that with work with children. So, brain growth happens throughout the lifetime. Ah, and I, I think the critical study, which I still find fascinating, Merzenich is the one that really brought the whole concept of brain plasticity. Brain plasticity basically, again, is another word for saying we can grow new neurons, neurogenesis, the genesis of new neurons in the brain. And the way he did this was fairly simple, and he had these wonderful new techniques of scanning and so forth. I frarinkly, frankly don't understand them, but we're going to need to understand these research techniques. And he taught monkeys to get reward by using one finger, any specific finger. And then, he did before and after scans and found that new neural patterns appeared in the monkey's brain after one day, after one day. This kicked off. People didn't believe his research. Finally, it was, ah, replicated enough. And now, we're aware that we can make significant change in the brain of the client- 

00:11:20
Neural Change/Growth Occurs in Both Client and Counselor Consciousness: the present 100-750 millisec. (RAS) Short-term memory: 10 sec, amygdala, thalamus Long-term memory: storehouse, hippocampus Working memory: multiple theories--draws on long-term and is activated by key stimuli Frontal cortex/hippocampus 

00:11:20
ALLEN IVEY - we're working with. But, guess what? Ah, we also change. Every client is changing us. And then we call that experience. And hopefully as you get experienced, new neural patterns will grow, one you understand, remember the name of that client. Hopefully, you remember the name of that client. Ah, if they're older, it may be more difficult. Ah, but we both change. Both the counselor and the client change. Ah, this diagram is particularly important, ah, 'coz it illustrates what's going on. Now, the data here I'm talking about comes from psychology. Ah, really, and it goes back to the measurement of what is attention, what are attentional processes? What is consciousness? Ah, the general sense, historically in psychology, consciousness is the present 100 to 750 milliseconds, a hundred se, a 100 to 750 milliseconds. That is what we call the now. When you do meditation work with the clients, relaxation training with your clients, you are bringing them to the now. We talk about the here and now in group work. The question is, are you bringing the group really to the now in that immediate period? And the thing is if anything is gonna enter the short-term memory, it has to be picked up in consciousness. And there you have the idea that you can remember five, seven things. Pick a, pick, there five to seven things at a time that will enter into your long-term memory. Ah, but we need to sort this out. So, how are you gonna direct your attention? Then we go to the microskill, but believe it or not, I was there at the invention of the word attending behavior, "selective attention". And that is really what happens there is the selective attention that leads to short-term memory. Now, obviously, what you wanna do in counseling and therapy is move the change into long-term memory. Move the change into long-term memory. And this means, by the way, that the, what I call the fifth stage of the interview, ah, generalization or action, is the most important phase. If you don't give homework, if you don't give people something to do afterwards, you're going to see a lot of loss of learning in the interview; You've got to reinforce the learning, you've got to get people things to take home, and you've got to get through them through the now, you gotta get their attention, you gotta bring it into short-term memory, and you wanna move it into long-term memory. And we're talking long-term memory. We of course are talking the ah, hypothalamus, and the, and the thalamus will actually direct in spotlight that particular memory. The thalamus is what I, what I always, what I call in my model "selective attention," choosing which thing to attend to. The thalamus kinda acts like a spotlight which takes things to the, ah, hippocampus. Ah, missing from that particular one, of course, is the amygdala, the source of emotion. If you don't have enough emotional energy, you're not going to have anything going to storehouse anyway. So, there has to be some emotional energy there as well. And part of the emotional energy comes from what we call relationship. So, does this mean that Rogers are thrown out with all of these numbers and so forth under? Of course, not. You have to have a relationship. You have to have an impact if you're going to take anything into long-term memory. The power you have then is really much more than you realize. I think sitting back and waiting for something to happen is dangerous. Obviously, I'm, ar, arguing for a more activist approach to counseling and therapy.

Neuron, Our Main Brain Cell Nerve impulse requires Long-term enhancement to transfer information Need to get client's attention and reinforce learning DNA at center of neuron Reproduced with permission from Dr. Chudler 

00:15:05
ALLEN IVEY Ah, let's get a look, micro here at this point, ah, familiar to I'm sure a good number of people. Ah, the nerve impulse requires long-term enhancement to transfer information. So, ah, this is just one, but when you say something to a client, it hits a whole batch of nerves to just think, think of just this one. And it's got to have enough emotional energy, enough stuff in short-term memory, to even move to the next cell. If you got a flat affect, and the client's got a, flat, ah, ah, ah, affect, nothing much is going to happen. There needs to be enough energy to move cells. So, you are a source of energy for the client, and by the way, the client is a source of energy for you as this information in the slide. You need to get the client's attention, we're back to the conscious now, and you need to reinforce learning. And that has to be reinforced during the interview. When a client says something and you paraphrase it back, it is a good thing. Ah, this thing(ph) it's not a, fa, it's, it's something positive. You are actually there and the, pa, act of paraphrasing it back, reinforcing learning. When you ask a skilled question, you open up a new avenue for learning. And therefore, you fo, and you follow that with a paraphrase and a summary, you're actually teaching that client new ways to think about themselves. And this is what's going on in just a single neuron. We also have DNA at the center so, lots of things happen in neurons, which are not to think about neurons as being relevant to counseling, but very specifically, we can see that your energy, your personhood makes a real difference, and how that person is-

Neural Networks "Neurons that wire together fire together" Learning in counseling requires neural networks and Long-term enhancement (LTE) (homework) Weiten, 2008. Reproduced with permission from Cengage 

00:16:50
ALLEN IVEY - gonna develop and grow. Ah, I like the saying, "Neurons, neurons that fi, wire together fire together," isn't just one neuron. The neurons build these connections like I've said, and you build neural nets. And here you see a neural net, a real neural net. It's really mind-boggling. You sit there in counseling, sit and say, "Hey, they can actually ge, get pictures of these neural nets." And this is what they took pictures of the monkeys with their fingers. Ah, learning in the counseling requires neural nets and long-term atacent, enhancement (LTE). A critical word in the neuroscience world is LTE. Some people call it long-term potentiation (LTP). I've chosen to go with long-term, ah, enhancement 'coz it's, to me, is a little more positive and perhaps a little clearer, but you have got to do something significant if we're gonna see change in our clients. Ah, this is just a picture of the synapse, ah, where the, ca, you can see there that the cell coming down and the picture of the synapse, and then, there's a receiving cell, ah, probably takes some of you back to introductory biology. Ah, let's move on to a more detailed look at the synapse. And here we see, ah, the axon, the large, large part of the, ah, synapse, the synaptic vesicles. And then, the actual synapse is the joining of the neuron with another. Notice there's a space. It isn't quite together. There is a space, and those little dots there are what we call neurotransmitters. And this is what we use our medications for, is to affect the neurotransmitters. Well again, what you're doing in counseling and therapy, if you get long-term enhancement (LTP/LTE), you are actually impacting the transmission of information. And what do we call that? We call that learning. We call that learning. 

00:18:55
Active synapses Reproduced with permission from Dr. Chudler 

00:18:55
ALLEN IVEY Ah, a lot of power, ah, that we have as counselors and therapists. What we have next there? Ah, and there's active synapses, and you can actually see the transmitters going from one to another. 

00:19:10
Example Neurotransmitters Glutamate--vital for learning and neuroplasticity. Too much, possible schizophrenia Dopamine--pleasure, reward system, increased by addictive substances--shows importance of strength-based approaches and wellness Serotonin--vital to mood. SSRI's permit more intake, wellness, meditation, exercise Norepinephrine/adrenaline-released in stress, makes one sharper. Too much, damaging cortisol is released 

00:19:10
ALLEN IVEY  Now, example neurotransmitters, ah, these are words, which, I'll predict in two years, will be familiar to all the people sitting in these seats now, ah, probably familiar to a fair, to at least some of you here now as well. Ah, glutamate, ah, ah, a neurotransmitter. This is the little mol, little neur, molecule as it goes from one synapse to another. Glutamate, vital for learning and neuroplasticity, are really central neurotransmitters. There are a raft of neurotransmitters. I actually think they're still finding new ones constantly. But these are the ones that really are kind of known at this point. Ah, dopamine, we hear about this in relationship to Parkinson's disease 'coz that's the deficiency of dopamine. And by the way, if you counsel with Parkinson's client, they're very likely to be depressed. But why is a ca, Parkinson's client depressed? Because the dopamine is low. Ah, what does this suggest for action when working with a Parkinson's client? We better work on positive emotions, positive strengths, and wellness. Ah, wonderful thing in my, ah, gym down in Sarasota, there is a, a book put out by a person in the gym who has Parkinson's. He worked with a personal trainer, and he described that a personal trainer did with him, to get him able to stand straight, move better, and so forth. Just 'coz you're, have Parkinson's, it doesn't mean that is the end. Now, one thing I'll probably say more than once, a president of the American Medical Association, a rec, recent president said, "It is unethical for any physician to see a patient unless they prescribe exercise." It is unethical to let a patient leave without prescribing exercise. I'll throw that at us. It's unethical for us to work with any type of client or patient unless we prescribe physical exercise. And what are we doing in our schools? No exercise, no gym, no nothing, a little, Governor Crist is concerned about the physical shape. You've got to move that body. You've got to keep things moving. You gotta get the blood flow going, exercise, exercise, exercise. John Ratey, ah, one of the America's ten best physicians, his book there "Spark" says that exercise is the, a number one thing for brain development, and for, and he summarizes the evidence. So, exercise needs to be a clear counseling intervention that you have available. Ah, serotonin, how many people know that serotonin are high of running? About(ph) few people do. We gotta get you guys out, you gotta like run because ah, I love the serotonin high. That first half-mile of running was a disaster. And then, about after a half-mile, it kicked in, and I came home happy. And then, my knee went out. And, ah, my wife says I have never been as nice since. You, that serotonin is real critical stuff. Ah, this is where we get the SSRIs, ah, vital for our mood. Ah, these SSRIs per, permit more intake. So, in effect, meds work. We've got to acknowledge that. I've been anti-med all, all my life, and yet, I finally had to accept the fact that medications are important thing. Question is a balance between. And I'll probably say this again but evidence is that, ah, cognitive behavioral therapy and, ah, medications, research indicates they're about equally effective short-term. But, guess what? Long- term cognitive behavioral therapy seems to be better. They put the two together, that seems to work fairly effectively as well. So, don't write off meds. What you need to do is learn about meds so you can talk intelligently. So, you don't sit there, ah, with the psychiatrist in your school or the, ah, physician with a blank look in front of your face. I think it's your duty, and honor, and responsibility to get with it and learn these various neurotransmitters and learn about which specific meds work. And that's my particular area where I'm really trying to push now, is to understand that more fully. Ah, now, keep in mind that wellness stuff: exercise, meditation, ah, relaxation training, really promote the development of serotonin. So the idea is think of, you need to think about what can we do to produce more wellness feelings. 'Coz once you've got more wellness feelings in the client's body and client's mind, their problems are gonna be much easier to deal with. Now, in 1974, I started writing about what I called the positive asset search. And I said at that point, "Don't do any counseling unless you've sort, sorted out positive strengths and assets in the client." Now, this has grown over the years. Until now I say, "What is, what are the family resources? And, what are the gender resources? Ah, what are the cultural resources? Ah, who are your heroes?" Ah, working with an African American client, "What does Martin Luther King say to you personally? What strength and joy can you get from him?" Ah, working with a, a gay client, ah, I was doing this at Stanford University during a live demonstration with a gay client, and I said, "Well, who's your hero? Who's your gay hero?" And, ah, he really couldn't think of any, anybody. And then I said, "What about Harvey Milk? This is a fellow in San Francisco that stood up and really initiated gay rights in the San Francisco area. This guy acted like a hero." And he brightened up. The idea of having a model, you've got a grandmother, you've got a friend, the idea that these people pepped you up. And, ah, actually, when you think about your grandmother, think about it. You can probably feel the presence of your grandmother right now, or your mother or the person that you care about. That presence from the past is there. That is a positive resource which actually affects neurotransmitters in your body. Or you can think about your problems and you, ah, re, reinforces those type of neurotransmitters. I'm strongly recommending focus on what can be done. Ah, norepinephrine, ah, which also known as adrenaline as they're released in stress, it makes you sharper. Stress makes us sharper. So, when you get into counseling, if you want to produce change, after you've gotta solve the relationship and so forth, a little stress is a good thing for the client. Now, what are, how do we give stress in the clients? We confront them. On one hand you say this, on the other hand you're saying that. That is a stress-inducing element. But you've done this from a secure base in terms of which they're better able to deal with that stressor of their incongruities and their conflicts. So, bring out the stress but don't overstress. If you overstress, boom, cortisol comes out, and the brain gets issues. And this is what happens I think in issues of sexism, racism, heterosexin or sometimes called homophobia, the way we treat disabled people is that we are really putting cortisol into the brain through harassment, through problem, a problem-oriented approach. Ah, in, when, when I, when I learned counseling way back when ah, I was told absolutely be not, the, the words then was non-directive, it wasn't person-centered. And I was supposed to sit back and let the client say whatever he or she wants to say. And with these results in, and I think it's still active on our field, is you spend hours listening to problems. And guess what? Your client always has another problem. And, ah, so you can spend interview after interview on problems, but it paid relative(ph), little attention to solutions. Fortunately, CBT, Viktor Frankl's, ah, logotherapy, ah, and people in experiential stuff have wised up and have learned to take a po, more positive approach. But let's not forget that Rogers also said positive regard. And positive regard is a real critical issue for building, ah, support, mood support. In the other hand, ah, the, I think we need a little more activation. Ah, I actually have got into this work, Gestalt therapy is coming back to me as important. Why Gestalt? It excites the person. Gestalt excitation is the word they used in Gestalt. How can we excite the person to a positive change? So, we're actually cha, ex, ex, specifically in our therapy, acting on neurotransmitters. 

00:28:10
ALLEN IVEY Ah, I'll just mention quickly here without getting into it. GABA, as an inhibitory neuron, so you got, ah, in, in, inhibitory neurotransmitter, and it prevents them becoming too active, and stimulated by a, alcohol. And anti-anxiety drugs can be calming, but you can also calm by meditation. My point basically is you take what the neurotransmitters do. We have counseling and therapy strategies to impact these neurotransmitters and the same goal as drugs. Ah, the next one, everybody fails. How is, ah, an, anandamide, anandamide, this, in fact's what is actually a little bit called the cannabinoid receptors. Marijuana affects the nucleus, ambu, accumbens, the brain's pleasure center. So, drugs, cocaine, et cetera, hit the brain's pleasure center. Can you see our problem? Can you see why we fail so often with this particular type of issue? Ah, we have thus far, no proven medications to work on this particular neurotransmitter. Let us pray that they find them. They're certainly searching for, ah, medication that will affect this particular neurotransmitter. Ah, if you're into marijuana, this is the part of the brain that you're affecting, the nucleus accumbens, that's also affected by sex and other fun things. Ah, the only thing that I've seen that seemed to be effective, ah, is motivational interviewing, ah, which is a strategy, which is, unfortunately, are not taught in our counseling and, ah, theories course yet. You also tend not to get fe, much in a feminist theory. You tend not to get brief therapy. These are some therapies that really make a difference. Your theories of counseling course is great but your theories of counseling text probably doesn't include some of these things. It doesn't, it probably doesn't include issues on wellness that I think that are really critical for producing human change. Acetylcholine, this is back to our old folks, ah, and Alzheimer's disease. Ah, this one affects the central nervous system and memory issues and Alzheimer's disease. Aricept is the most effective drug with this. There are many, many drugs right now in trial to work with Alzheimer disease. But, guess what? The specific treatments recommended by neurologists and psychiatrists for Azheimer is, number one, exercise. If you got an old person you're dealing with, get them moving. If they have signs of Alzheimer's, get them on a regular exercise program. This will get the blood flow going to the brain, obviously. Get the neurotransmitters working. Increase the production of acetylcholine, meditation, social relationships, work with your older folks on social skills. Ah, find them positive activities. All of these things research shows can slow the development of Alzheimer. These are counseling interventions. Ah, medications can be useful, but you as counselors and therapists can make one big difference, ah, and change people. So it really, in one sense, I'm not telling you anything new, I'm simply saying, "Hey, we can make a difference in this complex area of-

00:31:30
ALLEN IVEY - neuro, neurotransmitters. Ah, and this is just another summary of, ah, this one that goes on with it. This is acetycholine, and, ah, again, shows the whole issue of neurotransmitters, the axon, uhm, ah, with myelin. A small thing I think its important, not small, big thing is important to remember is that when we're working with that difficult age from 16, ah, 14 to 25, the problem there is myelination, which is the outside of the axon. And, ah, you don't really get fully myelate, myelilate, myelinated until about 25, 26. And this is one of the reasons we see all that impulsive behavior, ah, acting out and so forth. People, if you can get to keep them alive to 25, 26, the chances are, ah, they'll straighten out. Ah, I wish I had the magic book for how to counsel these particular difficult type, types of kids, but you need to be aware that you're actually working with the physiological problem when you're working with teens. What did that suggest? It suggests probably we need to work on, ah, the pleasure center. What can we give kids that is fun? And you're sitting here with this ki, child who's 16 to 18 with nothing to do. Ah, what are they gonna do? But they need something that's fun, so you can begin to see where the acting out comes from. So again, this leads us to prevention and social action, a real difficult thing for our community, because we really wanna store these kids away and not deal with them. And the question is what can we do as counselors and therapists to help them in that whole process of myelination so we can keep them alive and out of trouble. Ah, this one I don't know- 

00:33:10
Baseball Analogy Neurotransmitters - are molecules communicating messages--the baseball Pitcher transmitting cell--mols. 15 Catchers receives interacting balls (mols.)-- GABA, noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin Many balls or neurotransmitters together result in thinking Reuptake inhibitor - pitcher's glove clogs and the balls bounces back to the catcher SSRI's (Serotonin reuptake inhibitors) Prozac, Zoloft depression NARI noradrenaline- Wellbutrin 

00:33:10
ALLEN IVEY - I've, I have a little difficulty explaining. It's supposed to be simplifying the learning process. I'm not sure that it does. But over there on the, on the left, ah, you see you got a picture of a baseball picture. And then, you got a picture, ah, ah, a picture of a catcher. Well, neurotransmitters, we can think of it, they are molecules, but think of them as, ah, baseball. So, the transmitting cell, through the synapse, is throwing a molecule, ah, at the next, at then, at the, ah, next cell. Ah, but where it gets, ah, complicated is that each neurotransmitter needs a different type of rec, receiving cell. So imagine that this neurotransmitter, this pitcher is throwing 15 balls all at once to 15 different catchers, and these catchers have to be integrated for learning to occur. Ah, many balls or neurotransmitters together result in thinking. I mean, my God, how complex can it get? Ah, it's no wonder that we kinda wanna shy away from this stuff. Ah, then, just for what it's worth, ah, this is some language, ah, that eventually you're, you're gonna know far better than I do. But right know, ah, we need to think about reuptake inhibitors. Now, we're getting back to meds. And, a picture, and the thing is, the pitcher's glove clogs and the ball bounces back to the catcher. In other words, the ball, a catcher is forced, what was happening inside, there's not enough serotonin getting through. Ah, what, what happens is the catcher throws it back, but the pitchers bug is, glove is clogged and it forces it back and forces more serotonin into the cell, thus, the client becomes happier and here you have the SSRI's, ah, Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, Prozac, Zoloft, particularly effective with depression. But let's remember that cognitive-behavioral therapy is equally effective with depression. Ah, and one of the things I used to do with all the patients at the VA, I'd teach them relaxation training as the first step of therapy. I didn't know about exercise at that point but it's very, very hard to be depressed when you're on a machine. 

00:35:35
 Hmm. 

00:35:35
ALLEN IVEY Very, very hard to do. It is harder to be depressed when you're walking. It's harder to be, now, meditation when you're depressed is probably a little bit more difficult. Ah, then you have the noradrenaline as Wellbutrin, which attracts, ah, a little bit, attacks the same issue a little different, a little differently. 

00:35:50
Baseball Analogy 2 Agonists stimulate catcher's glove and unclogs the cell. Activate and mimic the neurotransmitter. 5-HT2 serotonin receptor stimulated by overeating, sugar, cocaine, Phen Phen -- sugar, amphetamines Imitrex, Buspar (anti anxiety, but some big time effect) Antagonists (SARI) clog the catcher's glove and bounce it back to the pitcher. Used with a variety of physical issues. Serzone and Dysyrel blockers. Which? SSRI's increase level in blood and cover a lot of territory. Agonists address the problem area with less side effects. SARI, alternative 

00:35:50
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, now there's also what they call agonist and that stimulates the catcher's glove, so, the other one, the SSRI's force the ball back and back and back and back while the a, agonists stimulate the catcher's glove, unclogs the catcher's glove and activate and mimic the neurotransmitter. Ah, particularly important, ah, is the 5-HT2 serotonin receptor which is stimulated by overeating... (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:36:20
ALLEN IVEY ...sugar... (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:36:20
ALLEN IVEY  cocaine, Phen Phen, that wonderful diet one. (laughs) I put sugar in twice (laughs) and amphetamines. So, if you can see the battle we have in keeping kids happy, much easier to take an upper and a drug than it is to, ah, going to something else and as fast letting to me to see sugar as one of those things that catches that same thing. (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:36:50
ALLEN IVEY And I mean, I don't know how many people here have a sugar addiction. I, I'll confess to it. We gotta have something sweet. Ah, what you're doing is that you're hitting up 5-HT2 serotonin receptor. Ah, now Imitrex and Buspar, ah, anti-anxiety, ah, seem to help but some, some people have a big time effect from Imitrex or Buspar, and Imitrex, by the way, is, is mainly a sleep med, right? 

00:37:15
 Yeah. Sort of, for migraine headaches. 

00:37:15
ALLEN IVEY Migraine headache, okay. It's a migraine headache one, that's right, migraine headache. That shows my knowledge about drugs. Ah, I'm working on it. And then there's antagonist which clog the catcher's glove and bounce it back to the pitcher and that's used at the variety of physical issues, and you're getting to Serzone and Dysyrel blockers. And which one do you pick, out of all of these possibilities for your depressed client? SSRI's increased level in the blood and cover a lot of territory, ah, they're the broadest that's why they're tend to be use the most. Agonists address the problem area with less side effects and, ah, the an, an, antagonist, ah, ah, provides simply another alternative. 

00:37:55
Medications that increase serotonin Increase serotonin synthesis: L-Tryptophan Decrease serotonin metabolism: MAO inhibitors Increase serotonin release: Amphetamines, Cocaine Inhibit serotonin uptake Tricyclic Antidepressants: Amitriptyline Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI): Prozac Other: Meperidine, Dextromethorphan Direct Serotonin Receptor Agonists: Buspar, Imitrex Dopamine agonists: Amantadine, Wellbutrin, Levodopa Other Non-specific Serotonin increase: Lithium 

00:37:55
ALLEN IVEY  Now, this is what kinda boggles my mind 'coz imagine, you're a physician, a GP or a psychiatrist, these are your possibilities. You got all of these list of things. I'm not gonna read them all, is that you can increase serotonin. You can decrease the metabolism. You can crease, increase the serotonin release. Give them cocaine and increase their, that will solve problem. I'll get rid of the depression. Ah, or we can give them, ah, an Amitryptiline, Prozac et cetera. Then, we can go to Buspar. You got lots of possibilities. (crosstalk) 

00:38:35
 Hmm. Yeah. 

00:38:35
ALLEN IVEY Now, I can't say this for sure but I would venture to say right now that most people in this room know as much or more than most general practitioners prescribing these drugs. 

00:38:45
 That's right. 

00:38:45
ALLEN IVEY Why do I say that? Simply because this is incredibly complex and when you, when you're sitting there in the doctor's office, I know we've all been in a doctor's office, there's always somebody there from the drug company. Those guys from drug company come by weekly to sell Prozac or Buspar or whatever it is. And so, the physician so pressed with, you know, patient lower of twenty-five hundred, three thousand, ah, they're gonna take the latest drug and crossed their fingers and they tend to prescribe these drugs, I think, by crossing their fingers. 

00:39:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:39:15
ALLEN IVEY  I would venture to say that right now people in this room know as much as the average physician. The other thing I say why I believe this, is that I've been interested in Alzheimer's. I have viewed, ah, the work of the most prominent neurologist, ah, ah, one of the most prominent neurologist, ah, I like him a lot, so I, (laughs) and from my, my perspective, he is the most prominent neurologist but Dr. Atri, ah, did a short, did a continuing education unit for, ah, general practitioners and I said, "Can I see it?" He gave it and he said, "But you won't understand it." I read it and I said, "Oh, my God." (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
 Hmm. 

00:39:55
ALLEN IVEY  I understood every word and I had not done that much study at that point and I said, "Is that the level of continuing education in medicine? Scary." (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
 Hmm. 

00:40:05
ALLEN IVEY  And the thing is most of them I don't think have seen a chart like this, ah, ah, which indicates the real complexity of this issue. Also, I also say, I gotta forgive the physicians simply because nobody really knows which one works. How do they do it? They deal the cards and pray. 

00:40:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:40:25
ALLEN IVEY They deal the cards and pray. Now, there maybe an expert physician that would come in and really disagree with me, and I suspect there are physicians that have some good signs and some wo, far out knowledge but I think, by and large, this is a level of practice we have with medications. I also wanna say, ah, for your edification, ah, we just got back from the American Counseling Association meeting in Honolulu and on the way, I picked up, ah, U.S. news and world report. They're talking about the ten best careers for the next, ah, ah, next few years and, ah, among the ten was wellness coach, (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
ALLEN IVEY  among the ten was wellness coach. Again, you gotta ask yourself what are you learning about wellness. How are you going to integrate it into your practice? Is it obviously going to be a lucrative thing in the future? Ah, is counseling gonna be smart enough to be part, be ki, ah, include wellness coach as part of our work? Are we gonna let it go to the amateurs? We have the basis to do fantastic wellness work. All we gotta start doing is say, "Hey, I can be a wellness coach." Almost by definition, ah, everybody who graduates in this program now, whether or not they know neurotransmitters is a, is a wellness coach. 

00:41:45
The cerebral cortex: Four key areas But the brain is holistic, interactive! 

00:41:45
ALLEN IVEY Okay. Ah, next, ah, something that's familiar to us all, ah, there is the good old cerebral cortex. Keep in mind, as I break things down, everything is interactive. I, gotten very precise that in a lot of, when you get to those neurotransmitters, you'll think, well, that's answer but hey, there's many, many other things besides neurotransmitters. The brain is an interactive system just like the university, in many parts, it can only function if it's all there (laughs) and with all the cuts you're having, maybe universities isn't all there right now but, ah, my sympathy. 

00:42:20
Frontal Cortex Keep holism in awareness Executive functioning, abstract reasoning, decision making, attentional processes-- positive emotions Language problems, personality changes. Alzheimer's Right more linear, intuitive, spacial, nonverbal, impulsive 

00:42:20
ALLEN IVEY Well, ah, and, this is defi, probably, for the most part, you do know, ah, that frontal lobe, ah, where concerned with executive functioning, decision making and so forth. That's what basically puts you right through, ah, graduate school. Abstract reasoning, decision making occurs in that frontal lobe, ah, the attentional processes, your brain fires when it pays attention to something, ah, and this is where, surprisingly, the positive emotions predominantly lie. Now, this is arguable because positive emotions again are throughout the brain but positive emotions take some thought. It's a little harder to build positive emotions than negative emotions. Just think, sad, mad, fear, glad, three clear negative emotions, only one positive from our classic rubik, never through with this so we can add disgust which is really a negative emotion again, and then surprise. I'm kinda hard-pressed to say where I'm gonna put surprise as an emotion. I have trouble of calling it emotion but these are called the six basic emotions. I'm kinda happy with the four and I'm willing, sometimes, to add disgust, but three negatives, one positive, in other words if you're, and there's an old saying in a marriage, ah, for every negative that goes on, you need three positives, comments, but doing marriage counseling three positives for every negative. And when the couples talk, they tend to talk about their negatives and their issues without much, in a way, a problem. I got a clue for you. I just got this recently at a conference and that is, ah, Gatshack(ph) who does work with, ah, ah, mar, mar, married couples up at the University of Washington really an incredible scholar but one thing I got, the thing that stood out from his presentation, he said, "When you come back to your lover or your partner, greet them with a six minute, six second kiss." 

00:44:25
[sil.] 

00:44:25
ALLEN IVEY Ah, it will make a difference. I've tried it with Mary and it works. (laughs) And, and the thing is, you sit there how many times and you come home and continue on the computer while your friend or lover or your partner comes in, get up. I was talking with, ah, Carolyn Tucker at Gainesville and she asked her husband what she, she had not, she would, this, this I heard her a week before. Carolyn was saying, she asked her husband what he wanted for, from her and he said, "What I'd like you to do is get off that damn little computer and come and greet me," and now, she does that and says it makes quite a difference to know what's more important? The stuff on the computer or the relationship, Rogers again. What's the most important? The relationship. So, that, though marriage counseling thing is something for you all to think about as well. That might help you keep things together. Ah, language problems, personality changes, this tends that Alzheimer's tends to happen with executive function issues. Ah, intuitive, spacial, nonverbal, impulsive. One thing that's fascinating to me is, ah, I've seen some things in the literature which suggest that creativity exist when the two parts of the brain come together, the rational and the less rational. So, in effect, working with the intuitive part and the executive part may be a very useful way to help, to confront people and help fi, people find new ways to think. That's just a speculative idea on my part. 

00:46:00
Parietal, Temporal, Occipital Keep holism in awareness (DCT) Temporal--auditory and memory (Learning style) Occipital--visual processing Cerebellum--motor and now seems important in many issues 

00:46:00
ALLEN IVEY Ah, the other three parts of the brain, the parietal, five senses and spacial sense, basically, what do you see, hear, feel, taste, ah, et cetera. And keep in mind, the very first, if you go to the conscious now that hundred, the hu, hundred, ah, seven hundred fifty milliseconds, this is where the senses come first, what do you see, hear, feel, taste, touch. Ah, that comes from the parietal section, but think about it, then it, then it, of course, it goes from there to the front where they organize these ideas. So, they are not just total isolation, the frontal cortex, ah, organize these issues. But if you're going to work with a client, I argue on our, my Developmental Counseling and Therapy is let's bring them back to "here and now" sensory experience. When you go hear a client's story and it's an important story, what did you hear? What are you hearing? And I, I don't say what did you hear. I said what are you, let's go back to that story, get it in your mind, what are you hearing? What are you seeing rather than what do you see, what, instead of bring it to a present tense here and now. When you bring it to the here and now, you've got a better access to short-term memory and long-term memory, so that awakening that comes from here and now type of things, consciously, what are you seeing, what, ah, are you feeling, et cetera, is going to be more powerful than sitting back and reflecting a feeling. When we reflect a feeling, you're really moving to the frontal lobe, asking them to think about their feelings. (crosstalk) 

00:47:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:47:35
ALLEN IVEY  Thinking about their feelings is very important. I don't deny that. But experiencing them in the here and now is very, very different than reflecting, but keep in mind that, ah, feelings can be explored at a sensory level. It can also be explored at a detailed concrete level or you can step back and reflect on them. Ah, a real critical skill is reflection of feeling, but are you gonna be in the here and now or the there and then of reflection, a very critical issue to think about. And then you get into the temporal lobe, ah, auditory and memory and then you're into issues of learning style, different, and I'm not going to get into learning style but this is a place in education and I guess in developmental counseling and therapy, different clients, different, ah, people have different learning styles. We don't, our counseling and therapy theories are top down. This is the theory we're going to impose on the client, top down. That doesn't sound very egalitarian. If you're going to work on the learning style, what is the style and being of this client? How can we work from their way of thinking, their way, their world view, and again we're back to multicultural. How can we come from the style of the client and then, our task is to match our style with the client, which is kind of turning things backward. We do that in developmental counseling and therapy. I think feminist therapy gets in this, into that as well because they see there is, ah, women's learning style as this multicultural work. Ah, cerebellum, ah, motor, ah, and actually a cutting edge area now is the cerebellum, which usually we just left, with just motor functions and now they're saying, realize it's critical in all kinds of other areas as well and the research on that is blooming, ah, so, expect a lot more to be coming out of the, at the back of the brain. The other thing about motor work is think about social skills training and role playing with your client. If they do something motorically, they're going to hold it much longer in their mind. Actually sitting there, if you're learning a counseling theory, if you engage in a role play or take the counseling theory into actual practice that's going to increase your memory and your effectiveness, and the motor stuff is really, really effective from making things happen. What are you doing to effect motoric stuff in your client? 

00:50:05
Mirror Neuron and Empathy Mirror neurons fire when we see another person experience life. If see pain, our neurons fire. A child may cry when another child falls. Premotor cortex, parietal lobe, cerebellum, supplementary motor area Empathy can be increased; if not used may be lost. Less firing at others' pain in antisocial personality. Mindfulness practice--compassion 

00:50:05
ALLEN IVEY Ah, one that's fascinating to me, and actually, this is the one that got me started in the whole thing to be totally honest. I heard about bringing plasticity but then I ran into an article by Decety, D-e-c-e-t-y, which, ah, is on our website, ah, www.emicrotraining.com, www.emicrotraining.com, and what Decety, Decety has, far in a way, the best review of empathy I have ever seen. He does the psychological stuff that we all know and then he points out the research in the fields which says that here's the stuff that really me, what empathy really means physiologically. And the thing is, mirror neurons are called fire when we see another experience life. In other words, we're not just changing brains but when we see somebody saying, when you see somebody else say something, it impacts our mirror brain, mir, our, the, our mirror neurons. Empathy really is the ability to sense the world of the other and that there's physic, clear physiological empathy, emphasis that there really is something called empathy at a biological level. And it makes sense if you think about it, is that, this automatic response we have to a baby, that's wired in and the fact that it's wired in, the mirror neurons is very important for human survival, for our survival, survival of the species, survival of your genes. Ah, now. 

00:51:35
ALLEN IVEY Mirror neurto, neurons, they fire when we see another person experience life. Ah, getting to children ah, particularly, young children, there's this classic thing where in two children are playing side by side, one falls and cries, the other child starts crying as well. This is actually the mirror neuron firing early on as a sign that empathy has basically started development, being sensitive to another pain which you've got there is the inability to separate self from other and of course, many therapists have trouble distinguishing themselves from their patient as well. So, it isn't just ah, the mirror, and if you get a person whose ah, life is somewhat like yours, you can get blurred in this mirror neuron empathy bit where you're not quite sure which is you and which is the other person. Ah, ah, one of the issues ah, I don't know if it's still true but ah, in the early stages of the lesbian movement ah, ah, one of the therapy issues was that ah, that the absence of boundaries between the, the, the, the couple, in other words they were so, so close together and they were in the family therapies enmeshed, that they basically an example of the mirror neurons firing and you're very close together, very empathic which has its pluses and of course the minuses because you start losing a sense of individuality. Ah, and this one thing I think where we need to see counseling su, supervision is ah, when our mirror, mirror neurons are firing a little too heavily, we may be enmeshed in a transferential ah, issue. There you have psychodynamic ah, concepts validated by what goes on in neuroscience. Ah, then apparently, the premotor cortex, the parietal lobe, cerebellum and supplementary motor area are particularly ah, important in this particular thing. You got at least four identified plus. I think several other areas in the brain, obviously, emotional areas and so forth. It's a good example. The mirror neurons, even if you can spot them, I think firing specifically in the frontal cortex, they are throughout the brain. Ah, within this framework, empathy can be increased. This is through listening skills, their conscious practice. You can start to learn to see how the other person is feeling. You can get more skilled at empathy. It isn't ah, just a fixed streak. You can become more skilled and empathic and understanding. Ah, this is a basic biological sense of kinship, human relationships putting people in relationship one with another and we're back to Rogers. Is it really is a critical aspect of counseling and therapy? Rogers stressed the relationship better than anyone else. It's been fascinating to me ah, who'll be, who gradually over the years became very much in a cognitive behavioral orientation to get into the neuroscience and be dragged back to a very key importance of Rogers. I've always felt the relationship was central but in neuroscience, I find relationship as even more central. Ah, one that's particularly catches me and this is in the Decety article, research indicates that antisocial personalities ah, the client diagnosed with criminal or antisocial behavior and also you got the child who's acting out in a cruel way in the classroom, simply their neurons, their mirror neurons are not firing efficiently, in other words physiologically, they don't really experience or understand the pain somebody else is experiencing. Ah, which is kind of a scary type of thing ah, literally there's a clear biological root that shows up in criminal and antisocial personality and again ah, our most difficult type of client. Ah, certain places ah, ah, all that neuroscience tells us, well, this is a tough client and ah, we still got a long way to go before we can work with some of these issues. Ah, although and again the clue is fun, what can we do to make life more pleasurable ah, for people 'coz then they don't need to get off on somebody else's pain. Ah, the work with the, the Dalai Lama group ah, Mary and I were lucky enough to do a two-day session at the MIT ah, Dalai Lama Institute a few years back and we've also done the ah, mindfulness meditation of ah, Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and ah, meditation is particularly useful in developing compassion and understanding for others particularly, if you meditate with a focus on compassion. So, the Buddhist have got it right ah, in terms of getting empathy and understanding for the world and meditation is very much a strong recommended treatment ah, for our clients. And think about that, that's a calming type of thing. Other clients are going to need the highs of serotonin. And so, you sit there and begin to see a lot of counseling is really about balancing highs and lows and what does this, what does this client need at this particular time, does he need an upper, in terms of our counseling intervention or does he need a downer in terms of something calming. Ah, so again, it gets us a little idea of balance and the idea that, well, one approach isn't going to work and that's one, that's where I come back to Gestalt excitation and this Gestalt empty chair exercises you know, they're very involving. They're motoric. They use the body, and really, they, very much bring the client to the now, that present now and I frankly can't think of any, any strategy at least at this moment in this room. It is really more effective in bringing a client to a now than Gestalt exercises, which ah, we really need to bring Fritz Pearls back and look at him again, I think in a much more depth and from a new perspective. Exactly, how that's going to work, I'll let you figure that out. Ah, ah, the limbic system, the social brain and this is where it becomes really important for us. The other stuff is important but this is really important for us as counselors. Ah, the hippocampus is the memory or organ that works with the frontal organ and this is where we want a nice, fat, plump hippocampus restores your long-term, which is central place for long- term memory. You really, this is really critical- 

00:58:25
Limbic System--2 - Hippocampus--memory "organ", works with frontal cortex - Amygdala--energy tells us what needs to be recalled.Too much PTS. Reproduced with permission from Dr. Boeree 

00:58:25
ALLEN IVEY - in terms of what a person knows and that really is the physical manifestation of long term memory and that ori, original thing where I talked about sho, consciousness short term memory. Ah, this is where you really get into, ah, e, 'coz you can't do much of the executive function if you don't have a long-term memory. So, you got this problem in Alzheimer's, of course, where executive function goes along with that memory and that at some point ah, these, these poor people end up in "Lala(ph) Land" and what is it ah, one person in three over eighty-five has it, one and five over seventy, you go down these numbers and they're rather scary when you think, look in this class, young now but ah, unless we come up with some good, good meds and there are good meds coming. Ah, we're going to have a ah, a massive ah, problem. Ah, the amygdala down a little bit lower, that's for the energy, in other words, if you don't impact enough you're not gonna ha, nothing's going to happen. That's where I start talking excitatory confrontation ah, thing ah, direct as think people actively doing something as really critic, you want that energy. Not enough energy, no memory ah, too much, now, imagine ah, ah, a war veteran some of the people in here I think are interested in ah, trauma counseling, posttraumatic stress. I don't say tra, by the way, I don't say posttraumatic stress disorder. I say posttraumatic stress, 'coz I say that what happened when you've been that severely stress is a logical response to an insane situation calling it a disorder, I think is really unfair to the person that's facing posttraumatic, serious posttraumatic stress. And I've seen things written by soldiers in which in Vietnam, a bomb comes by, and think again about those sensory area, areas. They talk about a, the bomb and the terror entering every orifice. It goes in the ears. Do you see it? Do you feel the blast? It even goes in, they say, up to the anus. They feel it coming inside. It totally comes into the body and these massive stressors in war. And what does that do? Cortisol, which is important for excitation, floods the brain ah, can destroy memory lo, can destroy memory and cha, destroy and change memory in the hippocampus. And too much energy really can destroy and so when you're working with a person with posttraumatic stress, keep in mind posttraumatic stress, rape ah, one of my students did a dissertation which she found that ah, the borderline personality style ah, when she worked with these people, she found that the ah, eighteen out of twenty of the borderline patients in her particular sample had experienced childhood abused. So we sit there and complain about the borderline patient, a good number of them have experienced childhood abuse. Ah, and we get angry and so forth, but you, again, think about that issue of boundaries. What the, the boundaries of a borderline had not been res, respected and they've learned to manipulate people by manipulating your boundaries. They're great readers of people. But the thing is, don't get angry. Start thinking what is really going on with them. They really are victims of posttrau, survivors, excuse me, survivors of posttraumatic stress. Ah, you can go through a whole wrap of things. I'm beginning to think that ah, ninety five percent of our clients will have some form of posttraumatic stress impact. And we really need to give that more attention because if you get divorced ah, go through a divorce, you're going to have sleepless nights and you're going to have night sweats frequently and you go through the symptoms of posttraumatic stress and you're going to have a lot of those symptoms. If you get a se, severe automobile accident, if you have a break-in, if you have a rape, you name it, again and again, most people, the loss of a parent ah, early on or later on can produce for some people posttraumatic stress. Ah, again and again we're working with the issues of post traumatic stress. I also wanna hit that issue of, of that word, "stress" because that is the real issue we need to think about in counseling and when I'll be coming to and a little bit more detail later. Ah, also the amygdala is the primary seat of sad, mad, fear and disgust those negative emotions located deeply in the base of the brain and I've mentioned earlier that the frontal cortex probably working with the hippocampus is the seat of our positive emotions. So in effect, and it makes sense ah, if you go through biological history, how do we, how did the, how did our forebearers survive not by thinking pleasant thoughts but by running when the bear came after them or the whatever ah, by being mad at each other in a competitive, I got to get something for my family versus your family and then sad when you didn't pull it off. Other, these are very ma, sensible emotions to have ah, from our history and they're located probably deeper in the brain which says that our whole issue of feelings, emotions are really, really, from my perspective, I've always been a be, a believer in feelings in the counseling process. I am now a deeper believer in feel, the importance of emotions in the counseling process. I'm also now aware that I've got to work a lot harder on wellness and positive emotions to compete with those primary things sitting that deep. Ah, you tend not to have posttraumatic stress ah, in form of a posttraumatic stress in your brain. The closest you've got to a positive feeling, I'm afraid is a cocaine rush and you can imagine ah, why we might see more ah, more veterans on drugs and ah, meds simply because they've gone through these very difficult types of experience. How can they get pleasure? Well, let's take some coke and ah, get on with it.

Limbic System -- 3 - Reproduced with permission from Dr. Doeree 

01:04:45
ALLEN IVEY Ah, the hypothalamus is a switching station from inside to outside. It's sort of ah, a relay ah, a lot of hormone control related to the pituitary and so forth. Ah, the nucleus a, ac, accumbens ah, the sex and pleasure center. That's the one I was talking earlier about and, and (inaudible ), a transmitter is that we really want to impact this pleasure center and how can we have fun and how can we make people, and that's a here and now type of thing. Ah, hi, it really isn't a there and then, so how can we help people ah, ah, get pleasure in the here and now? Again, a lot easier to pick up a piece of coke and it really shows the real difficulty in these areas. Ah, and on the other hand, that knowledge may in the long run make it possible for us to develop better treatment programs. And I think that again, motivational interviewing, we started out with alcohol and it's broadening it's scope and by the way, motivational interviewing is so close to the microskills' five stage interview. I'm not going to talk about that but ah, basically, the motivational interviewing and the microskills five stage interview are almost identical ah, different language at times. And then, the medial prefrontal cortex is the center of those mirror neurons closely related in ni, limbic system. So, the limbic system and the medial prefrontal cortex is really where we need to work on positive emotions to combat those more ba, basic, negative issues, which are present biologically. Ah, now, we're gonna turn to the microskills framework and I had here you see what we call the microskills hierarchy and ah, these are specific skills in counseling and this is really more, I heard that the people that have taken, anybody seen my Intentional Interviewing and Counseling book? Nope. Oh, you've missed the best book on counseling skills that exist. And by the way the original, if you had a counseling skills book that didn't cite me, they still came from my book ah, guaranteed, guaranteed ah, modesty. Ah, but we le, we bre, we break about the skills out in a hierarchy of, of action and at the bottom of this is wellness. Before I start getting the skills, I say, we need to build all of our skill work on a base of wellness. And I've said wellness throughout this thing and even though I'm talking biology, I'm obviously been talking environmental interventions, medications, yes, and appropriate ways but environmental interventions and social justice as part of this pro, product. Attending behavior, which goes back, you've heard this word. This goes back to our original work mega years ago. Ah, measurable, attention is measurable through brain imagining in both client and counselor. The recticular activating system gets aroused. The thalamus acts like a spotlight for selective attention and ah, communicating attention is central if you're going to do anything in counseling. Ah, simple point that is bio, intention is biological as well as philosophical, as well as a counseling skill. So you have to have attention and we can identify specific parts of the brain that relate to attentional processes. 

01:08:10
 Yeah. 

01:08:10
Questions - "Why" questions particularly move to long-term memory Closed and Open Questions 

01:08:10
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, questions and another skill in the microskills framework is asking questions can impact old memories in the hippocampus and these memories may be distorted or distort present experience, so the way you ask a question can distort. You can change a memory by the way you ask a question. Now, we're back to this issue of children. Let's take a look for a moment at children and we have kids that ah, said that they were abused by their ah, day care center. Okay? Then, you got an issue, what type of questions were being asked by the interviewers, leading questions which led to what we call a constructed memory. If you're working with a child, be very delicate and very careful with because a child would give you what you want. If you really want to know what's going with on with the child, be very, very careful with those questions 'coz you can change and distort memory. This is one of the issues really, right questions are always questionable in the counseling process and yet questions are really central also particularly, in cognitive behavioral therapy. It's just the idea we need to be aware that we change client's experience and meaning by the way we ask questions. Ah, the very act of interviewing changes the, the brain, remember, a long-term enhancement. How you interview changes the brain. Ah, did, did they show you this film of Rogers, Pearls, and Ellis, interviewing Gloria? Have you seen that? 

01:09:40
 Yes. 

01:09:40
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. There's a lot of heads not at there. Okay, ah, a friend of mine, Naomi Jemera(ph), studied this and she's studied the language interactions. In all the three interviews, Gloria mimics the language and style of the therapist. So Rogers influences Gloria's view of her life and she becomes a lifelong adherer. Ah, Ellis influenced her to talk like Ellis in a more rational sense. Fritz Pearls brought her to the here and now. Each one language system changes the client. So your theory of choice and do you still talk about theory of choice or do you talk eclectic? You're still talking theory of choice. No, don't do theory of choice, please, please. Ah, there's lots of good, I've gone through, I was a committed Rogerian. I was a directive therapist. I said, encounter (inaudible ). I got out to Big Sur and got in those hot tubs, as in encounter groups are the only thing. Then I, I, I did my, I got into my cognitive behavioral thing. I said, "No, no such thing as a motivation." Now, within five years of psychoanalysis and found that was the truth, along the way I said, "My God, they all work." 

01:10:55
 (inaudible [01:11:00.08]). 

01:10:55
ALLEN IVEY And where are we again? To some extent, we're back to Rogers, relationship, relationship, and then some skill and strategies after that, skills and strategies after that. If you stay with one theory, you're missing lots of wonderful stuff and there is no best approach ah, as long as you have a solid relationship from my perspective. Ah, but again, we also hear on our courses, why questions are dangerous. Now, they can see why I say, why questions are dangerous because they lead to the search for reasons and the truth is we never really can know why something happens. Nonetheless, I think why question is used to (inaudible ) our lies, but why questions, I think are the ones that are probably, the most likely to produce a particularly distorted memories. And we have this, we have this false memory syn, syndrome. I'm quite committed to, there are memories that are repressed. I mean, I have found memories in my own life and I've talked to, ah, many and I, I've talked to enough ah, service people that bring up long term post traumatic stress and they're hearing now that I know that memories are repressed and that is one way for the hippocampus to deal, we then put them in a corner and forget about them. At the same time, don't count on those long term memories that come and pop up by surprise as being real. They've got to be treated very gingerly ah, 'coz we don't what is real and what isn't. 

01:12:25
Observation Skills Eberhardt--Blacks and Whites both exhibit greater brain activity when they view same race faces 

01:12:25
ALLEN IVEY Ah, we have another skill in microskills called observations. Ah, and to be not too surprised, the Japanese are more holistic thinkers than we are. They use, there's more awareness of interaction. Ah, I think, Eberhardt's work at Stanford University is particularly interesting and we need to follow her name, E-b-e-r-h-a-r- d-t. Go to her website, just put the key in Eberhardt and you can read in detail ah, she's an African American scholar at Stanford University and ah, she is the one that found that when you have, have people sitting there and you show you them a face of the same race, that you'll get more brain activity than if you see a person of a different race. So the issue really is, is again you're kind of into the mirror neuron type of thing, the parallel of experience. So this business of multicultural, cross- cultural counseling is no joke, it's real, it's right there in the brain. And how do you cope with that? Ah, one way to cope with it, of course is to say, "I'm, I'm White you're Black or I'm Black you're White." How is this going to affect the interview? Let's talk about it for a little while ah, bringing up those cultural differences and pacing up to them ah, rather than stepping aside them. Are there, and if, and a male-female issue, I can say as most assuredly as a, as an older person or as an, I, I like the word elder. As an elder ah, I like if I were come to a young person in counseling. I would much prefer that person say, "Hey, I'm 32 ah, you're 74. How are you gonna deal, how was it going to be for you working with me as a younger person?" I think that's an obvious thing that really is necessary. The same thing holds true in many other situations as well. I'm wondering also ah, I've not seen applications at this point to children, but I'm sure there's something in there for children as well of sharing her cultural specific differences that really might exist. Ah, but Eberhardt has a lot of work on a race and neuroscience. Ah, take a look at her work ah, expression tran, expressions transmit emotions. If you smile, your client will be more likely to smile. This is called au, automatic mimicry. Ah, I think, one of the reasons Mary does so well, she's smiling all the time. She does incredibly well cross-culturally because she is just a naturally warm smiley person. You can get by all kinds of stuff if you smile and communicate that you're a warm person. Ah, all kinds of stuff but it doesn't mean you could do everything, but smiling makes a difference. If you're a happy person, I remember ah, when I start, was about to start psychoanalytic therapy, I want something really different, I want a union. I went and saw this guy and he was so depressed and I sit and say, "I can't, I couldn't see you, you're just too sad. You don't want to see a sad therapist." I didn't anyway, maybe you do, I don't know, I sure didn't. Ah, and then the thing is the smallest details were picked up by the brain unconsciously. So if you have some problems cross-culturally, Black and White, White and Black, Asian, et cetera, male, female, your client, patient is going to pick it up. Don't think it can be hidden. Why? They may not be conscious but they're getting it at some level. So this idea of authenticity and congruence, Rogers again, darn it (laughs) ah, is really critical. This means, look at yourself, your own biases, what's your cultural history, what's your gender history, what are your feelings about people who are gay and so forth. You need to get yourself straight the best you can. And the thing, let's face it, none of us can, but you need to indicate that you're in process at least for your therapist. And the thing is, one thing is interesting to me. If I'm looking around, if I'm walking by and I look at somebody, let's say in an airport, and they're not looking at me, many times they'll return and look at me. What's going on there is peripheral vision. Our frontal vision ah, moves a little more slowly. We have been taught gen, biologically, not taught, biologically, we're set up to have the corners of our eyes and watch for danger and the corners of our eyes are really wired right directly to the amygdala. And so we really are very vulnerable, and this is where nonverbal communication becomes really critical on looking at yourself. There is so much going on the counseling interview that I'm glad I'm about, about to be done with it all. (laughs) I mean, too much, too much, but it, it is fascinating, and you can tell I still love it, ah. Encouraging, paraphrasing and summarization. Well, active listening is a clea, clear part of that relationship, that when you mirror backed what they said, your mirror neurons are putting in verbal sense what they already sense nonverbally. They can understand, you get empathic, nonverbally but the words help as well. Ah, dopamine release occurs when positive events are discussed, particularly with visualization. So you are, if successful interview releasing dopamine in the interview, that positive neurotransmitter help them feel better. The critical thing to think about is that you are actually making them feel better through dopamine release. When you discuss positive events, if you sit there and discuss negative events endlessly, you're gonna produce more negative events and more hitting down in the more difficult parts of the limbic system. Ah, visualization, this, one thing I stress on my developmental counseling, a therapy is what, a lot of visual image, imagery and what are you seeing right in the now, and visual imagery brings about dopa, dopamine release. So one very good counseling technique is simply build a positive image. Maybe you do this ah, what is the pleasant place that makes you feel relaxed, they just visit the, the lake or the beach or your mother, whatever it is, a pleasant image is there. And you can, a pleasant image, just getting a pleasant image is going to release dopamine. And then if you work on the imagery, you can locate that imagery in a specific place in your body. Ah, a lot of people will say, "I feel my, that my grandmother in my heart." Well, that's true or not, or not, there is actually a physiological feeling that goes with visual imagery. It isn't just the image, the image is usually located in the body somewhere. Or "I can feel my grandmother's strength." "Ah, I like my father's way of being assertive," and this images are with us. And anytime we want, we can get that positive visualization to bring about a dopamine release. So we have our history with this all the time and visual imagery is a wonderful way to bring about dopamine release and help a person deal with stress in a more positive way, way. Being heard prepares people for new learning, so that summarization skill and so forth. "I have been heard. Now I've been heard, I'm ready to, ready to listen." So these listening skills are really critical. Ah, if you paraphrase negatives, expect neurotransmitters to pass on this information, thus supporting negative neural networks and reinforcing negative memories. How many teachers, how many people here are teachers that reinforce negative neurals, negative neural, nets? That's a problem in education. Ah, a lot of negative neural nets are reinforced in the educational process. One of the reason people don't support schools more often is they got those negative memories because of negative experiences. 

01:20:30
Amygdala powers the emotional system by noting intensity. Must have sufficient intensity for memory to occur. Think LTE 

01:20:30
ALLEN IVEY Ah, reflection of feelings, ah, emotions of sad, mad, ah, fear, amygdala, glad, frontal cortex, show in brain imaging. I've told, told you that. Ah, ah, amygdala intensity and the nucleus ambu, accumbens, a pleasure center, addictions that are, but again, there's spread(ph) action of feeling skill works on all of these critical issues of emotion retentioning, long-term memory. Unless you got emotions, you're not going to remember anything. You've got to have emotion or ah, emotional arousal for learning to occur. 

01:21:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, confrontation or you, it's the skill. It's pointing out the inconsistency in the, in the patient, thus motivating in need for consistency. Interesting, breeding recently, is creativity, some people are arguing and saying, I'm not saying it's necessary so, but it makes some sense, located connections between the right and the left brain. In other words, if you get the, the, the discontinuity between the right and left brain, this is where creativity and new stuff sparks. Confrontation leads to creativity. Ah, and another one, neuroplasticity, new learning, new neurons occur when the two hemispheres synchronize activity. If you got a client feeling this way and that way, un-centered, the chances are they're not learning and you're not doing neurogenesis. You're not helping brain plasticity. You need to get the person centered and the whole issue of centering exercise is to prep people for creativity is really essential. And a supportive emphatic confrontation may produce change. We always say we want to be supportive, but keep in mind you're working with the antisocial. To be, even get their attention, you may have to do a very rough rock 'em, sock 'em type of approach. And the soft approach in counseling is often laughed at by, ah, the antisocial or narcissistic type. Difficult types of people to reach. 

01:22:30
Helping Clients to Discover Multiple Perspectives Attention lights up frontal cortex (plus RAC) Client selective attention is guided by past memory and new input--thalamus spotlight Real goal to get move new consciousness, new perspective to long-term memory 

01:22:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Focusing, ah, when, when I talked about focusing is, counseling too often focuses on the individual and the skill is remembering to spend some time on the interview focusing on the family, particularly family resources. Focus on the cultural context, ah, look at the family, look at the relationships the person has, sort out the strength. Ah, the issue really is to broaden consciousness within focusing. As Fritz Pearls sometimes said, "I, I, I, I," I get away from a strictly, "I" focus. Counseling is for the individual, but what is the situation? What is the broader or the broaderest ex, and where do the supports exists? Focusing is critical for that and basically, the thalamus is really pretty critical in helping the client focus on the problem differently. A lot of you're clients will say, depressed we've had, I, I've been particularly pleased with my work with depressed clients. Depressed clients is often in themselves, blaming their self, and what you'd like to do with the depressed client is to get them thinking about things in a different way, to get away from the "I" focus and then to realize that their depression came from some type of conflict in the past, ah, some type of situational type of thing. Many, many, many and we find a lot happens when you bring, ah, focus on cultural environmental issues and say, "This is how, this relates to you." Think of working with a, a woman that's been held down in an abused relationship and she stays in that relationship, because why? She's blaming herself. You need to help that person externalize and to see the social context, which happened there, which will free them up for making new decisions. So you wanna move consciousness, and one way to view the type of therapy and counseling is changing consciousness over time. What happened with the women's movement, the African American consciousness raising moving was, get conscious of what's going on with you. Ah, it's not my problem, the problem is sexism. It's not my problem, the problem is racism. And once you make those types of observations, you've made a great step toward mental health. When a person comes in and says, "I'm depressed," and they say, "No, you, I'm beca, because I'm a bad person," they begin to see what happened in their growing up, perhaps being bullied or et cetera. You set the desire, "Oh, this is a very liberating thing, to think that you're depression is not just your depression. It has an external reason, something that often you can do something about. Reflection of meaning, ah, spirituality lights up key brain areas, ah, the stuff I've been reading most recently said, "There's many areas in the brain that are lit up with spiritual, ah, images." Ah, so it's hard to say whether spirituality is different simply than a positive resource, but lot of good impetus that spirituality, people are into spiritual, religious issues and religious energies do well, but is that a belief system that is any better than believing and, ah, something else? That's an open question, but there's clearly, when you're getting into spirituality, prayer, meditation, different areas of the brain do light up. A little more into the prefrontal area, quite related to, ah, the feelings. Ah, meaning and, ah, meaning derives the lower centers and, ah, Nishi once said, "If you can find a why, you will find a how." If you could find a reason for being, you can survive a lot of things. And one thing I do stress in our skills book is reflection on meaning, helping our clients discern what they really want to have, what they really value. What do you, what is important, what do you want to leave behind when you die? 'Coz if you can setup a vision of your life, a lot of this other stuff is going to follow automatically, and we don't give enough attention to meaning issues in counseling and psychotherapy. What is the meaning of your life and Viktor Frankl, ah, who Mary and I had a wonderful, ah, two hours with, ah, after we went to Auschwitz in, ah, Poland. Ah, Frankl of course survived Auschwitz and how did he survive Auschwitz? Through finding a positive meaning everyday of his life. He searched actively to find positive meanings. There goes that frontal cortex consciously working to find positive emotions, something to look for. So discernment, a spiritual quest can be very important in finding meaning for one's life, ah, an area where I would like to see a lot more emphasis given. 

01:27:05
Interpretation/reframing, logical consequences, feedback, self-disclosure, directives Aim to reduce the hyperactivity of stress and bolster nucleus accumbens 

01:27:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, influencing skills, ah, negative emotions bubble up from the amygdala. That's stress and we all go through stress, day in and day out. I mean, good norse, good night. I think the whole idea being here at this time of the night is stressful enough. I, (laughs), I, I remember the time I fell asleep in the back row and the professor asked me a question. So I have sympathy for you all about now, and I really do. Ah, but the negative emotions bubble up from the amygdala and then the cortisol, as I said earlier, comes in and destroys neural nets and produces, mixes things up, produce all kinds of problems. Our aim as therapists, in other words, stress management from the CBT, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Program is increasingly, while I've come to Rogers, ah, for relationships, I come to Pearls for exultation. I also go to CBT particularly for stress management, and we all need to be highly skilled in stress management to keep that cortisevel, cortisol level down. How do we help people deal with that cortisol issue? Ah, I think about, ah, Evelyn Brooks, one of my very, very favorite doctor students, an, an, an African American student and she could tell how stressful her, ah, month had been in terms of racial incidence by the size of her phone bill. In other words, she would call home or her sister, "Could you believe this? Could you, and this happened," and the need to debrief these constant harassment, stressful events. Ah, and what happens, that cortisol build up and, ah, problems of course result. So what we need really then in working with, to work with an African American in a medical (inaudible ) hypertension, I'd say it's unethical unless you're doing stress management with them as well. The stress management can do wonderful work. And I wanna mention briefly social action and stress management at Gainesville, Carolyn Tucker. Carolyn Tucker, ah, did a four-part study which I won't get into. I'd give the essence of this, ah, 'coz there's, she compared Whites and Blacks and other things like this. But what she did, she went into a medical clinic and, ah, taught physicians how to relate to African American clients, an educational approach, learning, changing this. She taught in such things, one thing that stood out to me was that, she taught the physicians always put the rubber glove on in front of the African American patient. They don't trust you. Ah, but she said also, ah, she also set up some questionnaires, "What would you like to be called, ah, what name would you like to be called by when you come in?" And if it's miss or Mrs. or, ah, ah, or the first name, this is how it, they, and basically, they spend a lot of time and also some evidence that some White physicians will not touch, ah, African-Americans. So they got into the importance of being willing to touch your appro, touch appropriately, by the way. Ah, and what happened as a result of this training was that African-Americans had lower blood pressure, better medical compliance to, with the drugs, and lower blood clus, blood glucose level. This is social action in the community, teaching people how to get along. So the v, this is a wellness approach. It is really very important. I had another colleague, a good friend of mine that's now looking at the same parallel types of issues with older, ah, Latino clients and depression, and again, how can we develop systems that are more supportive? So it isn't just one-on-one counseling, what can we do with group work in changing office systems to make things more respectful to our clients. Stress management is really our most systematic wellness education. There's that word "exercise" again, meditation, then the career of the future, wellness coach. Wellness, wellness, wellness. Ah, stress ne, ah, social justice. I don't know how much emphasis your program is giving to social justice. It really is the current hot topic at the Counseling Association, ah, the last two or three years. That means action beyond the interview. Not just repairing people, what can you be doing in the community to make a difference? Ah, keeping in mind that stress is necessary for learning and it, the model for this, of course, is weightlifting. If you lift weights, you breakdown muscle, and you take off a day and you can go back and you'll be stronger, but if you're stressed every day emotionally, you don't get the day off, you can see that it, all of the, it doesn't build, necessarily build greater strength. Ah, gluco, glucocorticoids are re, released with just short-term pleasure, but long-term cortisol is toxic, lose neural connections, lose neural plasticity. Ah, so, what do we need to do? As I said in the beginning poverty and neglect in early childhood poisons the brain. Stress hormones injure language and memory, so you're really setting up these kids that don't get enough to eat, that live in stressful environments, real difficulty in schools, lifelong challenges. Ah, to sit there and ignore these kids is really, ah, a great challenge for us all. Ah, in the uterus, you probably heard this one, but un, the unborn child reacts to stressors of the mother. Important to keep the mothers away from stress, and keep them comfortable. The mother is stressed, you really wanna make that a very important part of treatment of, ah, in a well, in a well-baby clinic. Ah, not only that, too much cortisol affects genetic structures. So, this issue of genes being fixed, ah, was really something that's probably passed on to you in Introductory Biology. Ah, genes, we now know that genes can be impacted by environment. We also know that certain genes don't even do anything unless the environmental conditions are there to bring them out. So, the environment has a lot more impact. We had years and years of the Russians saying the environment was everything, ah, and that people from England and the United States saying the genes were everything. Ah, it looks like the Russians are winning their, the long-term race, ah, in terms of the impact to the environment. I've certainly talked about the trauma of racism, sexism, harassment, bullying, can we, and we've seen the results of bullying in our schools, ah, the terrible damage that happens to kids and we, I don't know what it is in Florida right now, but, ah, some of the States, the religious right is opposed to anti-bullying legislation. Why? Because they like to see gays bullied, bullied, and so, schools in some states can't do anti-bullying programs because, ah, this mi, this might say that, ah, being gay is okay, and, ah, the damage that happens from bullying is incredible. So what are you going, going to do? Ah, Mary's school 10, 15 years ago, set up an anti-bullying program, was, came right out of the center of the school and very, very effective program which shut down bullying, I won't go into that detail, but, ah, then we have, they all may mean we need stress management wellness education. I've said that 20 times today, I guess, stress management wellness education. Become a wellness coach and trainer, and move into the community. Don't sit in your office, move into the community. What are you gonna do to make a difference at a larger level? I'm gonna close with a brief mention of the Tom Sweeney-Jane Myers Wellness Model.

Factor Analysis Reveals 5 Dimensions of the Indivisible Self with 17 Components Useful for Assessment and Counseling 1. Essential Self: cultural identity, gender identity, spirituality, self-care (Meaning of life) 2. Social Self: Friendship, love (Connectedness with others) 3. Coping Self: Leisure, stress management, self-worth, realistic beliefs (Cognitive behavioral strategies) 4. Creative Self: Thinking, emotions, control, work, positive humor (Giving to self and the world) 5. Physical Self: Exercise, nutrition (Caring for one's own body) 

01:35:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  To Factor Analysis, this is Research-Based Model, it's more comprehensive, been around for 20 years. We're now bringing it into practical, ah, practical application. Ah, Is, I guess I'll start at the Creative Self, which, is for Factor Analysis, thinking and emotions are the first two issues listed there. So here we have, to produce wellness, we need to get people thinking well, and again, you have all kinds of cognitive, behavioral, ah, person-centered, you-name-it things that help people think better. We need to work with their emotions. This is of ah, ah, emotional control as a particular aspect of the well person. Ah, a person needs to work and here we have careers. These are things that counselor do. How can we help a person find a happy, effective career? A positive humor and the ability to laugh in this business, you should have, try to have a several good laughs a day, and, and sometimes you're in graduate school, (laughing) it's kinda hard to find things to laugh about. They're always thankful for that professor that tells jokes 'coz it does break things up just a bit. Ah, coping, you need some leisure time. Ah, I'd say at least an hour a day for you to be by yourself incomparable. How many people get an hour a day to do what they wanna do? Well, just a few of you, ah, but this is something that's really critical, to have a wellness program. Ah, leisure, stress management, again, we talked about that, feelings of self-worth, realistic beliefs, we're back to Albert Ellis and the Cognitive Movement. Ah, these are the coping strategies. These are things that we do as wellness counselors. So, what you already get from your Theories of Counseling, all I'm asking is for a slight reframing of putting it in a wellness, positive model. And exercise nutrition a spirit, ah, exercise nutrition, I certainly pushed nutrition critical. And then we have spirituality, gender identity, cultural identity, (inaudible ) cultural identity is critical for emotional health and wellness. Self- care that mean brushing your teeth and putting seatbelt on as almost activity. Ah, friendship and love obviously are essential. Now, I recommend this 20 miles wellness models as a comprehensive way to think about this. Can what she, they ultimately recommend, that we recommend than our books is take your clients, your wellness assessment. Where are they on his dimension to wellness, were they're weak, start working with specific things to help them develop more of the positive approach.
