ROSIE  We are indeed blessed with a great opening and I believe now that with that blessing, the mic is even fixed. It is my distinct pleasure to introduce a phenomenal man to kick off the key note of this conference. We wanted to for sure, have a research focused on this conference, and no better person came to mind than Dr. Stanley Sue. And I can tell you he is the man who obviously needs not to have a vita read. He sent me a vita and I lost it. He emailed me a vita and I lost it. And I wrote something this morning and lost it. I can tell you that Stanley Sue is a full Professor, Director of the Asian-American Studies Program, and Director of the National Research Institute on Asian-American Mental Health, which is funded by the National Institute of Mental Health. Dr. Sue has received all kinds of awards including two distinguished service and contribution awards from the American Psychological Association. He is, of course, a Fellow in APA and a Past President of Division 9. Ladies and gentlemen, when I was out to dinner with my planning organizers last night though, that was Milba[ph], Derald, and Lisa. Derald said, "Rosie you don't have to worry about what to say about Stan. All they really need to know is that he is my brother." Dr. Sue.

DR. STANLEY SUE  Thank you, Rosie. Uhm, this is a very momentous occasion and it's already successful. I'm just looking around at the, the number of people here who are registered. I guess it was a record, what, 500 or 600. In fact, uhm, ah, I had four graduate students who registered late and they were denied registration. So, naturally I called Derald. I said, "Derald can you do something?" And he said, "Sorry." So I know the conference is very successful. Uhm, I think that uhm, ah, the conference is also a very ah, uhm, very promising and, and, and because, ah, we also have Dick Suinn as our APA President who has been, ah, one of his main goals is, one of his main goals is ethnicity and diversity, and I told Dick that since this was a momentous occasion that I would say something very candid and frank. And then he, he said, "Does that mean you're going to attack your brother Derald in public?" Ah, actually not. Ah, Derald made the mistake of asking me to introduce him, ah, this fall when he gives his, ah, Division 45 Presidential address and I had my comments, ah, waiting for him at that time. What I wanna do this morning is to reflect on, ah, issues that have bedeviled the field of ethnic psychology, bedeviled the, the field for decades. Namely the relationship between ethnic bias and the practice of psychological science. The questions I will be addressing are these. Is science biased against ethic minority research? Are we simply playing at, some believe, a white man's game? Should we turn to alternatives rather than traditional, experimental, and empirical methods? Why is there a relative lack of ethnic research and high quality ethnic research? How can we promote and encourage good ethnic research? Let me state from the very outset my position. I believe that there is a lack of psychological research on ethnic minority populations, that the quality of research on ethnic minority groups is at a relatively, at, is at a relative low level that funding for ethnic research has been woefully inadequate, and that science or scientific methods are not the culprit. Rather the culprit is how science has been practiced, a problem that I shall referred to as selective enforcement of principles of science. This selective enforcement of principles of science has discouraged the growth and development of ethnic research. Ah, those are my main arguments. I use them to introduce for your consideration two resolutions. Uhm, ah, if we are to overcome this selective enforcement problem, ah, not only in the interest of ethnic minority populations but also in the promotion of better science. And I'll try and use some of my research to illustrate the issues. Research on ethnics has not been very sophisticated. And, ah, for example, it was only a few years ago that we, doing research on Asian-Americans, had to argue that Asian-Americans are not among the minority group. Very basic kinds of questions. We did research on utilization. Uhm, very descriptive kinds of research. Uhm, we wanted funding for our, our work and it was initially very hard to get funding for, for the, the work. That there is this lag in, in sophistication and theory. Are ethnic researchers therefore, ignorant? Ah, are we poorly trained or are we bad researchers? This kind of issue plagued me for, for many years because I was on review groups. I reviewed uhm, ah, articles submitted to journals and I noticed that there was a, a difference many times in the kind of articles submitted on ethnics from different, uhm, ah, individuals. Ah, and oftentimes, my, my criticisms of papers, my review of papers, differed from those of other referees. Ah, as one example and some of you are aware of this, several years ago I reviewed a paper submitted to American Psychologist. Ah, I, I, ah, thought I was very unbiased. Ah, I read the paper, I criticized it and recommended that it not be published. The paper then ah, uhm, ah, was published because five of the other reviewers raved about it. Uhm, I then, ah, so after the paper was published in American Psychologist, a number of Division 45 individuals read the paper. Were, were, that they were infuriated by it, critiqued the paper and so on. Why do we have this variability in judgments about quality? Now, ah, and, and I'll, I'll discuss that a little bit later. But the facts ah, seem to support some of the problems I have identified. For example, uhm, in the 1980's, I did report, ah, for the National Institute of Health on the number of grants awarded to ethnic minorities. Ah, as you can imagine, ah, there were very very few. Sandra Graham, ah, examined the number of empirical research articles on African-Americans, ah, in several psychology journals. Uhm, only about 3.6 percent of the articles were on African-Americans, 3.6 percent. In fact there seemed to be a decline in the number of empirical articles on African-Americans over time. Ah, Padilla and Lindholm, ah, have also noted the paucity of, of publications, ah, devoted to, ah, race, ethnicity, and culture in major psychological journals. Now, my, my beef is with the way science is practiced and, ah, to explain this, let me go on to some scientific principles if you bear with me. Uhm, science is essentially a way of knowing. There are many different ways of knowing. For example, we can know spiritually, we can know by our intuition, ah, and so on. Ah, science then is a way of knowing that relies on certain kinds of methods. It is not that science, uhm, provides absolutely accurate, ah, facts. Ah, for example, in, in our research, by definition, our research, ah, is, ah, accurate only, only most of the time. We have uhm, ah, we have type one and type two errors by convention that, that simply say that ah, uhm, science, uhm, is not exact. Now, ah, science is concerned with describing, explaining, predicting, and modifying phenomenon. There are two basic operating principles. One is the principle of convincingness. It refers to the direct relationship between the use of rigorous scientific methodology and our ability to convince or persuade a fair-minded, critically-thinking person of our findings or our conclusions. Science tries to convince others through the elegance and rigor of scientific methodology. The more rigorous, the better. The second principle on science is skepticism. One must question, doubt, or suspend judgment until sufficient information is available. Skeptics demand that evidence and proof be offered before conclusions can be drawn. Scientific skepticism is considered good. One must thoughtfully gather, ah, evidence and be, be persuaded by the evidence. Uhm, now, these are the two kind of guiding principles and I'll show, I'll try to show how we violate them in practice and violate them to the detriment of ethnic minority research. Ah, but there are other more specific kinds of procedures and concepts that we use in science. Ah, we know that in psychological science, ah, the concepts of operation, definitions, replication, matching, control, ah, ah, random experimental designs, sampling, theory building, confounding variables; we're all kind of aware of these, ah, concepts. Uhm, but the most basic concept in science is the ability to draw causal inferences from the research. That is we want to understand why something occurs. In order to do this, there are two main concerns. One is internal validity, the extent to which conclusions can be drawn about the causal effects of one variable to another. Uhm, ah, and typically we've studied that looking at independent and dependent variables. Uhm, the other is external validity, the extent to which we can generalize the results of the research to the populations and settings of interest. Both types of validity are necessary and should be equal partners in the scientific endeavor. However, attention always exist between internal and external validity. To achieve perfect internal validity, a laboratory setting is often necessary. To achieve perfect external validity, we must do the research in the real environment with all the noise that occurs in the real environment. Now, it is my belief that the two are not equal partners and that we have made a terrible mistake, ah, in the direction of paying attention to internal validity rather than external validity in our psychological science. This is what I mean by selective enforcement of scientific criteria. We criticize research for problems in internal validity yet we pay little, relatively little attention to external validity. Whether submitting research papers for publications or submitting research grant proposals for funding, ethnic research is scrutinized for internal validity problems. Ah, this is good and fine. Yet much of mainstream research, that is non-ethnic research, is not criticized for external validity problems. Ah, for example, Americans are the largest producers of psychological research. The overwhelming of the subject of the research is White-Americans. Ah, so, the United States constitutes less than five percent of the world's population. So from a population of less than five percent, we develop theories and principles that are soon to be universal. That is we falsely assume that IMEK phenomena that are culturally specific, we falsely assume that IMEK are ITEK phenomena that are universal across groups. Uhm, and just to understand this tendency of, of, ah, psychologists and probably others to assume universality, ah, can be illustrated in, ah, some of the work that I've done, ah, with, ah, APA Division 12 Task Force. So, this was a task force on psychological interventions. See some of you, ah, know this is the Chambless Committee. Ah, the task of the committee was to identify empirically validated therapies or treatments, ah, based on research. Uhm, ah, I did extensive work as a member of the committee to, ah, see if, if any of the empirically validated, ah, treatments had been used with members of ethnic minority populations. I found not a single study. Now, the problem here is that we designate treatment as being empirically validated. When we do that, we claim that the treatment is valid. We don't say the treatment with the population or interacting with the population. We try to attribute the property to the treatment. And in doing so, if we haven't tested it with other populations, how can we say the, the, ah, method is, is empirically validated. That's one example, I think, of our tendency to, to use, uhm, ah, concepts that we think are universal when in fact we have never tested them as being universal. In fact, now, ah, we don't call them empirically validated treatments. We call them empirically supported treatments. There's a good, nice distinction here and I'm, I was very glad to see that, ah, occurring. Ah, furthermore, we take the subject, our subject population very casually. Uhm, as noted by Padilla and Lindholm, uhm, that oftentimes when we do ethnic research or we see ethnic research being reported, we don't have much details. For example, here's a quote from a research report that they found. Subjects were 32 children from the Berkeley area. Subjects included 15 boys and girls. Children came from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds though most were Caucasian and middle class. From that description, we, we wouldn't be able to replicate the study. We, we don't know the variables and how to cross the variables. Another example, in all 423 sixth and seventh grade, ah, students participated in the study. The school was in a predominantly working class community. The average student was 11.87 years old and 13.8 for sixth and seventh graders respectively. The sample was equally representative of males and females with 68 percent of the sample being Caucasian, ah, 23 percent Black, five percent Hispanic, and seven percent other, uhm, minority status. These two descriptions give information but they are far too general and we cannot cross-tabulate so therefore we cannot replicate the study. In contrast, here's a description that they found regarding, uhm, ah, bu, re A, A, regarding some research on primates. The subjects were 28 pigtailed macaque infants. Of these, 17 were classified as normal or at low risk for developmental deficits, ah, and the 11 were classified as high risk. Of the high risk animals, six had experienced significant trauma at birth or during their early neonatal period. Three high risk subjects were part of an ongoing, ah, study examining the effects of parental reproductive history. It goes on and on precisely describing the nature of the sample. The detailed information, uhm, ah, reflects the importance that the primatologist placed on the sample. We have not done this with human beings. And I think that many times, uhm, ah, we failed to do this because we fail to appreciate the sample. We're more concerned about, ah, internal validity. Uhm, ah, our modus operandi in research, and I'm talking about the field, is to inappropriately assume that the work is ITEK in nature to those research who are concerned about race and ethnicity and bias, the burden of proof is placed on them to show that there are ethnic differences. Whatever happened to the scientific notion of skepticism where little is taken for granted, where conclusions are drawn from evidence and not from assumptions. We obviously, much of our research, mainstream research, uhm, ah, has violated the notion of skepticism. Uhm, now, the National Institute of Mental Health has, uhm, has adopted some policies that I think are intended to ah, increase the research and concerns on ethnic populations including, ah, women. For example, there are, as some of you know, there is a policy on the inclusion of women and minorities. Essentially, several, uhm, ah, points, ah, uhm, are, are, are pertinent here. One is that NIMH requires that, uhm, ah, that in human research that women and minorities, uhm, ah, be included. Uhm, secondly, that, uhm, cost cannot be used as an excuse for not including, ah, women and minorities. Uhm, third, that if you do not include women and minorities in your studies, you have to justify why. When the policy came out, a number of researchers complained. They felt that the policy was one of political correctness, uhm, that, uhm, ah, because there's political pressure for inclusion of women and minorities that this was not a scientific reason for their inclusion, their forced inclusion in, in things. Now, NIMH through, uhm, ah, Ann Holman and Delores Perone argued that the, the policy did not reflect political concerns but rather scientific concerns. The scientific principle that they cited was that the population is heterogeneous. Therefore, the research would have to reflect this heterogeneity. Uhm, both sides were a bit correct, ah, and we shouldn't be naive. Of course, there were political considerations. The policy would not have been adopted by NIMH if they were not political considerations and pressures. And we can ask, uhm, our president-elect, APA president-elect Pat DeLeon if, if, ah, there's a relationship between NIMH policies and, and, ah, some legislative, ah, pressure. Ah, on the other hand critics of the policy failed to see the scientific merit of inclusion. The fact that the nation is heterogeneous makes the inclusion policy important. However, heterogeneity per se is not a scientific matter. It's when we generalize from one sample to other populations that a scientific principle is pertinent. This is the external validity issue. If you want to draw conclusions about human beings, we, we must study human beings and not particular human beings. Ah, now, I'm not arguing that engaging in ethnic research is equal to external validity. However, ah, we live in a nation that is among the most ethnically, culturally diverse in the world. Why not take advantage of that by studying other populations within, ah, the United States, ah, in order to see, to test generality of theories and, and policies. Okay, now , ah, incidentally I also want to just mention when I, ah, when I uhm, stated that some researchers thought the policy was political correctness. I hate the term political correctness. Uhm, ah, it, uhm, what is politically correct changes over time and in fact it's politically correct now to say that things are politically correct. Uhm, okay. Now, A, I, when I was serving on the, uhm, ah, task force on psychological interventions and I mentioned that, ah, the, the validated treatments, ah, had not been really, ah, tested on ethnic minority populations. One member of the committee said, "Well does that mean we have to always test everything with every population? You know what my answer was? Absolutely! I mean, we're scientists. I mean, isn't this in the interest of science. I'm not saying that, that the treatment is necessarily, ah, that is valid for one group versus the other. But there's no excuse for not testing it with different populations and we can't really just assume that. So in the process, we have this problem of internal-external validity, uhm, and there's some effects on ethnic research. When we, when we, when we, ah, pay attention to internal validity rather than external validity, we downgrade the importance of different populations. Uhm, therefore, ethnic research has had, kind of a slow start. We haven't got the kind of funding that, ah, other, uhm, ah, ah, research has gotten. The research tends to be descriptive. And once it's descriptive, reviewers tend to distrust ethnic research. There's already, uhm, ah, an attitudinal bias against ethnic research. Uhm, ah, therefore, we also have the, have, it is difficult to train a lot of our students in ethnic research because the research tends to be descriptive. And on and on, we have this vicious cycle that's going back around and around. One of the, one of the important reasons I think why people do not do ethnic research and I'm talking about mainstream researchers is that ethnic research is simply very difficult to do. The easy way is to avoid ethnic research. Ah, for example, uhm, ah, David Takeuchi who's a colleague of ours at our research center, ah, wanted to study the prevalence of mental disorders among Chinese-Americans. This would be the first true prevalence study of any magnitude. We, uhm, ah, wanted to sample 1700 Chinese-Americans in a two-phase project. Applied to NIMH. We figured out our budget. To sample 1700 Chinese-Americans, we needed, ah, we needed in direct cost from the grant 1.5 million dollars. Ah, NIMH wisely agreed with us and saw the need to, uhm, ah, give that amount of money, ah, to, to have this project. Although when you think about it, to sample 1700 you need that much money? The research was very difficult to do. We had to, we had to go to 20,000 households in order to find 1700 respondents because ethnic minorities by definition, small populations, very difficult to sample. In addition, we, we couldn't use, the we, couldn't, we couldn't just take measures of psychopathology to use. We had to translate them. We have to test for, for, ah, validity and so on. Ethnic research is very difficult to do. We had to find, ah, translators and interpreters to go out into the field to interview individuals. Ah, all of this means that uhm, ah, many individuals therefore avoid ethnic research, the mainstream researchers, ah, and it puts us again on, on, a leg down in trying to, to change things. Uhm, uhm, now, furthermore, we do have evidence at many times, ah, research does, ah, reveal the fact that there are major ethnic differences uhm, ah, in, in, in our, our theories and in our, ah, conceptions. Uhm, for example, and I just want to mention two examples. How much time do I have? 

00:25:35
UNKNOWN It's alright. 

00:25:35
DR. STANLEY SUE  Oh, okay. Okay. I want to mention two examples. One was, ah, some research that Gordy Hall and I did, ah, looking at ethnic differences and sexual aggression. Uhm, one of the very consistent findings, ah, from Neil Malamuth and others is that, uhm, males who tend to engage in sexual aggression, ah, rape or, or forced sex, uhm, ah, do so because of what's called intrapersonal factors. That is, uhm, it's been found that, ah, people who are hostile toward women, who have rape myth beliefs, uhm, tend to engage in, in sexual aggression toward women, ah, more so than individuals who are low on these, ah, attitudes. Ah, we were questioning whether this, the intrapersonal, ah, ah, theories of, of, ah, sexual aggression would be appropriate for those individuals from more collectivistic cultures. So we want to study Asian-Americans. And, uhm, we wanted to study if perhaps Asian-Americans are more, uhm, ah, their sexual aggression is more related to, uhm, interpersonal kinds of things because of the collectivistic orientation. We ran measures of intrapersonal, uhm, uhm, uhm, ah, variables and interpersonal variables on Whites and Asian-Americans. And lo and behold we found that intrapersonal, uhm, ah, was important for both groups but only for Asian-Americans interpersonal variables. Relationships with others, significant, especially with parents that if parents found out you had engaged in sexual behavior. Ah, they were concerned about this and if they were high in this concern, it generally, uhm, was related to less self reported sexual aggression. We came up with a very different model of, of, ah, a behavior, ah, based on one's ethnicity. Another study we did. This was a study in trying to predict why certain Asian-American students are achieving well in, in, at universities. This was a study that, of, at the eight campuses in the University of California System. It was a study that was, uhm, sponsored by the Office of the President and involved, ah, the College Board. Ah, well, we want to see what factors would predict academic achievement among Asian-Americans. What we did was to take a sample about, 4,000 Asian-Americans, compare them with the sample of Whites, looking at predictors of university grades on the basis of high school grades and SAT, ah, and achievement test scores. Uhm, we want to see if the same variables predict subsequent academic performance. Ah, we ran the study and, uhm, we found some very interesting differences. Uhm, ah, whereas high school grades are the best predictors of subsequent grades in, in colleges for both samples, when you look at the SAT, the best predictor of, uhm, ah, performance within the SAT was SAT math for Asian-American students, not verbal. Verbal added virtually nothing to the prediction formula and the exact reverse was true for Whites. SAT verbal predicted subsequent grades, not SAT math. The differences were very striking. So that the prediction formulas for Asian-Americans and for Whites were dramatically different. Okay. What it means here is that, that culture and ethnicity can be extremely critical in, in, uhm, ah, explaining behavior and we should have the opportunity to show that in our psychological research and not confine our research to, ah, only one, ah, population. Uhm, okay. Let me, uhm, now turn, uhm, resolutions that, ah, may be controversial in the field but I think they're, ah, they have to be addressed. Uhm, resolution, ah, that I would like considered is and two of them, the first one is that those who construct theories and principles in psychology state the population basis on which the theories and principles are built. In the caser, a, in the case they are built on limited populations, we should consider them as local theories until such time they are cross validated. It's a scientific principle, a very legitimate scientific principle. So that now when we talk, for example, in the past when we had the theory of cognitive dissonance, we say that, uhm, cognitive dissonance theory was developed on this particular population. We don't know if it applies to other populations. That we state this rather than to, as, as we often assume when we come up with, ah, principles in psychology, that they apply to human beings. They don't apply to human beings. Not until we prove that empirically. Uhm, again, I'm not saying that theories and principles don't have generality. They may have generality. The point is that they require evidence in the best tradition of science and the principle of skepticism and cross validation. The burden of proof is to show that results are ITEK rather than IMEK. We must assume that they are only IMEK until we have further proof. The second resolution is, ah, is very straight forward. Research on different populations should be encouraged, funded, and supported if we are to progress in the science of psychology. For many years we have said that we need ethnic minority research because we need to understand ethnics, as if this will help ethnics. And certainly it does. But we failed then to appreciate that ethnic research is in the interest of science. How else can we develop our notions of, uhm, external validity and the universality of our principles and, and theories? In conclusion, science is not based, not, not, not biased against ethnic minority groups. Rather the problem is that the criteria used to judge suitability for publication and for funding are selectively enforced so that internal validity is elevated over external validity. In addition, because I think research is not as well developed as mainstream research and is more difficult to conduct, internal validity criteria, ah, act to suppress research progress. This in turn keeps ethnic research from becoming, ah, better developed. Ah, we should not turn away from science. Rather of which should demand that all research show relevance for different groups. Ah, and I hope that my resolutions are intended to do this. Thank you and I can take some questions and comments. 

00:32:35
[sil.] 

00:32:40
DR. STANLEY SUE  I, uhm, have to, I can't see very well, the lights are, yes. 

00:32:50
UNKNOWN I think your arguments are quite persuasive and (inaudible ) so, I, I, my question is (inaudible ) spirit of, ah, supporting and, and kind of against it, my question is this, how do, what criteria do propose for figuring out which, ah, categories of people are the appropriate ones can emphasize and which ones we don't have to emphasize? In the example you gave up the predictions of knowledge performance, ah, you emphasize ethnicity and my question is, you know, what about gender, what about nativity(ph), what about, uhm, you know, ah, (inaudible ) leading, ah, economic status, that's all kinds of other population variables that could also be relevant, and so my question, Do you have any suggestions what criteria or some way of thinking about that, that would be helpful to further (inaudible ) your resolutions? 

00:33:40
DR. STANLEY SUE Okay. Did everyone hear that question? Okay. The, repeat it? Uhm, how, how would, how would, how would we decide in view of the fact that uhm, ah, there are many, many different populations that ah, in, in which there, there is very little research. How would we essentially decide what characteristics really to focus on among a whole range of, of characteristics including class, gender, ah, and so on? Uhm, ah, obviously as scientist, you wanna know everything. So the, the guiding principle is all areas of, of endea, scientific endeavor are, are pertinent. That is you would want to find out what ah, all characteristics. But I think and when I talk about ethnic minorities, we have then a special, uhm, ah, reason for studying ethnicity. Ah, Theodore White had said that there are three problems that have always plagued the American society. Bread and butter, war and peace, and black and white. The last one has to do with ethnicity that this is a major social problem. How do we get ah, groups together (inaudible )by ethnicity and by race and what do we do when we see a wide disparity in the research. So ah, for me ah, ethnicity and race are primary are, are my priorities because they really mean something to society. We're trying to grapple with issue, these important kinds of issues. And yes, ah, as scientists, we should study all characteristics; class, ah, gender, ah, any other kind of background and demographic characteristics, yes. But we have a special obligation to try and solve those problems that we encounter in society. And certainly, race and ethnicity have been persistent problems. And, and in fact, uhm, somewhere else I stated that little, uhm, did our and I put this in quotes, "forefathers" (inaudible ) realized that when they brought servitude and slavery into the United States that they would also bring centuries of conflict and, and, and violence. And so that's the legacy. And so I think that for me one of the priorities is race and ethnicity. Other questions? Yes? 

00:36:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, uhm, another scientific principle or concept that I think is relevant to general point is the principle of, ah, the (inaudible ) and I think, ah, a lot of things that we really don't do is what would, what difference does it make, how significant is it that we get this finding or that finding. But when we talk about ethnicity and race, we're talking about a whole lot of unexplained therapies. Bell curve, ah, well, there's others flaws, ah, based Graced(ph) was talking about phenomena and you're talking about five percent (inaudible ) as if it was 90 percent race. So, when you talk about, ah, variability cause ethnicity and gender and race and all the rest of it. You're talking about 90, 95 percent of what affects people's lives and so... (crosstalk) 

00:36:45
DR. STANLEY SUE Uh hmm. 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN ...all the points it seems to me that your principles who may define as another one is we need, ah, try to accumulate both the knowledge base, based on, on what variants of human experience were accountable with those scientific work. 

00:36:55
DR. STANLEY SUE  Absolutely. Uhm, a good answer to the question. Uhm, that, okay. The James ah, James Jones', uhm, ah, comment was really that, ah, if we just single out certain kinds of, ah, variables such as, ah, ethnicity, we account for actually a very, very small proportion of the variance, ah, many times. And that to account for large proportion of the variance, we need to take into consideration all of these factors together. And so I think that's absolutely true, absolutely. Other questions or comments? Yes. 

00:37:35
UNKNOWN  You referred to the descriptive nature of talking about effective(ph) minority groups that's coming out today and thats, that's one of the reasons that, ah, either (inaudible ) more, uhm, tends to reject so that, uhm, (inaudible ), how can we convince this bias that at this point in it's development, descriptive research is very essential are explanatory theories are only good as our empirical(ph) descriptions of phenomenon and I think one of the negative consequences, all the criticisms about research with ethnic minorities lacking (inaudible ) theories is that researchers are being pushed to do research in an ethnic fashion. And sub, subscribe conceptual frameworks that don't appear as (inaudible ) but groups are widely accepted. 

00:38:55
DR. STANLEY SUE Okay. This is a major problem of how we convince, ah, ah, mainstream researchers, uhm, of the importance of ethnic research even if it's descriptive, and that many of the theories that, uhm, would form the basis for a more a sophisticated research, if I can paraphrase, ah, may not even be applicable to, ah, ethnic populations. Actually, I think the best way for other researchers to appreciate the nature of ethnic research is to force them to do it. Then they realize that there aren't these measures around, that there are sampling problems, that there are attitudinal differences in responses and, and so on. I think that the, the some of the mainstream researchers who have gone involved in the ethnic research have fully appreciated some of the difficulties. I think that's the only way. But as long as researchers avoid doing ethnic research because it's so difficult or they think it's too political or whatever, then they never fully appreciate the kinds of issues and problems, uhm, that, that, that many of us face. Yes? 

00:40:00
UNKNOWN  Well, the question. You've been arguing is that for (inaudible ) sometimes made that for political to as compare ethnics we're use few populations that are found with (inaudible ) stereotype minority populations and therefore the issue before (inaudible ) for a period time Please comment on that (inaudible )? 

00:40:37
DR. STANLEY SUE Okay. The comment was, uhm, that essentially that, uhm, oftentimes when we do group comparisons, comparisons of different ethnic groups, some groups look bad perhaps and that therefore shouldn't we focus more on within group differences. Uhm, actually, I'm less concerned, from, as a scientist, I'm less concerned about finding differences in groups as in explaining why those differences occur. That is I think, I think if we find, uhm, for example, ah, if we find that one group is not doing well, I mean, relative to another group, I think that's an important finding. But what matters is why that's the case and we need research to clarify that. For example, in mentioning the Bell curve. The fact that African-Americans score lower on IQ test uhm, ah, is not, to me is not a problem but why is that occurring? What does it mean for our society? And the, the genetic arguments versus the environmental arguments, I think that the important thing is to, to address those issues. So, ah, yes, there are times in which we should not compare different groups. For example, ah, Shelly, the late Shelly Korchin did some research on ah, the achievement patterns. Why some African-American adolescents do well? He was trying to explain that. He submitted this, uhm, paper for publication and it was rejected and one reviewer said, well the, the study was grievously flaud because there was no White control group. Now, Korchin later on said, but do we then ask that research on Whites have a Black control group? That there are these kinds of different standards. Yes, there are times in which it's very appropriate to do studies of a single group and look at within group differences, but I, I don't want to avoid, ah, between group comparisons also as with the, with the, with the requirement that we explain why those differences occur and that we do it in an honest, ah, kind of manner. Ah, uhm, so I guess my, my question is I think both are needed, both between within group and between group research. Yes. 

00:42:55
UNKNOWN One, uhm, one of the things that I found was the literature to that number one. We don't have consistent definitions of ethnicity and culture and what that means is that when we talk about different ethnic groups. They're not talking about the same. And in a recent study that I just finished, uhm, I found that, ah, cultural conflicts and background accounted for a much more of severities than classification by ethnicity, that I have not known into the literature(ph) many people were account for cultural, uhm, background and cultural conflict like language and that I (inaudible ) stuff like that. 

00:43:42
DR. STANLEY SUE Okay. I think, uhm, the, the, the real issue is over the fact that, uhm, oftentimes ethnicity and race are very difficult to define, and that some, that, ah, other variables may be more important than, than group designation. Uhm, ah, we've grappled with this before. For example, ah, in the research that we did with Gordy Hall, should we use Asians versus Whites as a variable or the degree of collectiveness versus individualism as a variable? Ah, what we generally find in that kind of research is that when we look at more personality kind of characteristics such as individualism and collectivism, it explains some of the variance but there are still variance that are attributable to being an Asian-American or being a White. That is uhm, oftentimes we, we see other kinds. It's, it's the same issue as some people saying that, ah, ethnic, ah, race issues are really reducible to social class. Well, obviously they aren't. Uhm, but social class explains a lot of the variance but there's something above and beyond that. So I, I would think that, and it probably depends on the characteristics that you're examining. Uhm, I think that both those characteristics within group are very important as well as the designations that we have. In fact to me the amazing thing is, despite our debates about what race really is and it's very difficult to define because we categorize rather than, uhm, and, and racial characteristics seem to be more continuous rather than discreet. Regardless of whether we consider ourselves Hispanic or Asian, ah, in terms of one's ethnic identity, what is amazing to me is that many times when we divide groups on the basis of ethnicity, we do see differences and they still persist. So, uhm, as a scientist, I think that the, the, ah, there is value in looking at group differences as well as within group variables that may account for, uhm, our findings. Yes. 

00:45:40
SHELLY  For me a lot of power of what you said has to do with changing our consciousness of what could research gets and those of us who teach and train undergraduates and graduate students, I think really need to hear what you're saying and integrate that into what we teach and I guess in that light, do you have plans to do a textbook or anything, I'm serious, I'm serious, that can assist, those people who teach research (inaudible ) because what you're talking about is defining how we particularly search what is good research and how research methods are being taught now, does not incorporate... (crosstalk) 

00:46:20
DR. STANLEY SUE Uh hmm. 

00:46:20
SHELLY ...a lot of the issues raised about what is the scientific. 

00:46:20
DR. STANLEY SUE  Yeah. Well, thanks Shelly. Uhm, you know, ah, to tell you, no, no, I haven't thought about integrating this in a text. Uhm, although we have a very, Derald, David, and I have a very good abnormal text around(ph). Uhm, ah, the, the, the, the, I must admit that, uhm, these ideas, kind of, surfaced over many many years. And there isn't, some of the ideas aren't as new. Ah, they surface over many years of sitting at review groups and feeling almost apologetic for ethnic research. Defending ethnic research and seemingly, why, they're criticizing, I can see the criticism but somehow they're ignoring an essence or something else. It was hard for me to articulate that until recently that, ah, that I finally found out that, uhm, rather than being on the defensive, we should really question what about external validity? If I were a journal editor and I made a policy that not only, not only, ah, must research show internal validity, they must show external validity. They must show that they have more relevance than for the particular ethnic population of study. Very few of the mainstream research that's published now would get published in my journal. And yet I'm applying rigorous scientific criteria. So I'm tired of, of, ah, this, this image that ethnic research is, is, uhm, lacking science and that others have science in their back pocket. That they've looked at a particular kind of science and they have ignored what I consider to be other populations that are essential in demonstrating any kind of generality in theories and principles. Yes. 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN I think what Shelly is asking (inaudible ) in Stanley Sue. 

00:48:13
DR. STANLEY SUE (laughing) Ah, well thank you for that. Uhm, ah, I think that ah, better than me writing a textbook, you can convey if you believe in these ideas and we pass a resolution, we can try and affect psychology in general and let them know that when, when principles are derived from, from research that they really indicate which population therefor. Ah, Because most researchers, uhm, ah, also like to think that their research has a lot of impact. And so maybe that will force them to do research on other populations. 

00:48:55
UNKNOWN Let's do both. 

00:48:55
DR. STANLEY SUE Let's do both. Yes, let's do. Let's do. Ah, Rosie is here, ah, one more or should, ah, are we running away over(ph)? 

00:49:05
ROSIE Okay, three. 

00:49:05
DR. STANLEY SUE Oh, oh, Joe, Joe White and, okay, two more? 

00:49:10
ROSIE  Okay. 

00:49:15
DR. STANLEY SUE Okay, two more, Joe and this gentleman. (crosstalk) 

00:49:15
ROSIE I they want to shorten their break, they can have two. 

00:49:15
DR. STANLEY SUE  Okay. If you want to shorten your break, you can have two. Uhm, okay. We'll come, we'll come to that. 

00:49:25
JOE WHITE (inaudible ). 

00:49:27
DR. STANLEY SUE Absolutely, Joe. Ah, I think I mentioned in, in one paper that we found that ethnic match between therapist and clients, ah, facilitated treatment outcomes. That study was then used by some to argue that, that, to argue for segregation, that Blacks should minister the Blacks, Whites should minister the Whites. This is in South Africa. And what's? 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:50:26
DR. STANLEY SUE It can be both. And that was my wishy way out of it. I mean, it really, it really can be both and, and, ah, I think, oh, ah, is ethnicity an independent or dependent variable? Ah, it can be both and, and, and we, we need to clarify things and I think we need to clarify things at this conference, our dialogues on, on things, and this might be one of the issues. Rosie? 

00:51:10
ROSIE  Ladies and gentlemen we had a, a giant to fall in the field of psychology last year. Dalmas Taylor who was like a terrier with a bone when it came to trying to change the complexion of psychology. He absolutely insisted that psychology, that APA fund and find young, well, not so young, students of color to progress through the field of psychology. And one thing at dinner, I said, "What about Dalmas since I didn't know him personally." They said, "Dalmas would not take no for an answer." And that's also part of the answer to the research question, that we cannot take no for an answer. And he love to dance. So, the 1999 National Multicultural Conference and Summit presents the Dalmas A. Taylor Award for a light that shines eternally, taking on the challenge of change, Stanley Sue, Ph.D., in honor of your pioneering leadership, scholarship, and aggressive advocacy for the inclusion of persons of color in the central fabric of the mission of higher education, and within the field of psychology. We present this to you at the First Annual National Multicultural Conference and Summit, January 28th through 29th 1999, New Port Beach, California. 

00:53:15
DR. STANLEY SUE  Thank you. Thank you very much. Uhm, thank you, Rosie. Thank you. This is, uhm, this is particularly an honor because I, I knew and worked with Dalmas for, for it must be 20, almost 25 years, uhm, and, uhm, ah, thank you for the honor(ph). 

00:53:50
ROSIE  We're going to take our break now and then we will be going to the breakout sessions. And let me encourage you to be on time. We're tight. Interact with the presentors as you can but get to your sessions, and remember what Derald said, "Distribute yourselves evenly."
