RICH SIMON Welcome everyone. My name's Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker. Welcome back to our series on treating anxiety, the latest advances. Elsewhere in this series mostly we have focused on work with adults and talking to clients in the language of adult talk and today we're gonna look at another perspective on anxiety treatment, which is a very significant issue and an important theme to introduce in this series, which is working with kids, especially small kids and their parents and understanding anxiety from a systemic point of view. And we're very fortunate to have someone who makes just that her specialty and here she is, our guest today, Lynn Lyons, from up in New Hampshire. Welcome! 

00:01:00
LYNN LYONS Hi Rich. Great to be here. I actually, just so you know, I'm only an hour north of Boston. It's not like I climbed out of my log cabin and found my way in front of a camera. 

00:01:15
RICH SIMON Oh, ok. Alright, it's just a log cabin in my head. Okay. Well, imagination plays a big part in anxiety and also my response to New Hampshire. 

00:01:25
LYNN LYONS (crosstalk) We're very civilized up here. We're very civilized up here. Most of the time. 

00:01:25
RICH SIMON So, um. Let's start off. Okay, you've made the treatment of anxiety your specialty and working particularly with kids and their families. 

00:01:40
LYNN LYONS Yes. 

00:01:40
RICH SIMON If you, if I might ask, what is it that personally, in your own personal life, that you, what about your own relationship with anxiety over the years? Have you had some, had to deal with some serious anxiety problems in your life? 

00:01:55
LYNN LYONS Yeah. As a kid, I was an anxious kid although not, I've never been shy. I've never been afraid to be in front of people, very social and all of that stuff. But where anxiety got a hold of me was dealing with medical stuff. So anything from going to a doctor's appointment, anybody talking about anything gross. So there were situations where somebody might even be telling a story about, oh I fell down and I cut my arm open and I had to get stitches, and I would have such panic attacks and such anxiety that I would lose consciousness. 

00:02:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Wow. 

00:02:30
LYNN LYONS And I was telling, I told many people, it wasn't really a graceful sort of swooning, it was a completely, come undone, heart pounding, gonna throw up, fight it as much as I could and finally hit the dirt. I learned pretty early on to get down because gravity was gonna be not my friend. 

00:02:50
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Wow. Yeah. 

00:02:55
LYNN LYONS So, as I involved in my practice and sort of got older and had kids of my own and started talking to more and more parents and kids about this anxiety thing, realized I really had some good perspectives on it because I'd been there and many people have said to me, well, you don't know how it feels. I really do. I know what it feels like to just not know what to do and I had to figure out what to do. I had to figure out what to do really when I was 26 and I started practicing. I got a job at a hospital, which, you could image for a medically phobic person is a bit of a challenge. It was sort of, you know, daily exposure therapy. But even sitting with clients, I have a very vivid memory of a woman telling me about the removal of her ovarian cyst and I felt this panic come over me. I started feeling like I was gonna pass out. I kind of politely excused myself for a moment because I said I needed to use the bathroom and brand new newly minted social worker walked out of the door of the treatment room and hit the dirt. 

00:04:05
RICH SIMON Oh my. 

00:04:05
LYNN LYONS So it was, yeah. I don't even know how long I was gone. I came back. I don't know that if she was any the wiser. I'm sure my color must have been horrible when I returned. But, I know what it feels like and it rules your life. As a kid I was very aware of not going to movies, wanting to sit in the aisle seat. I had a friend who broke her leg sledding. We were all gonna go visit him in the hospital. I wouldn't go. So I'm very, very aware of how this anxiety thing kind of moves in and sets up shop and takes over. And I think that helps me in my work with kids. 

00:04:40
RICH SIMON Now, so did you try any form of psychotherapy? Is that what lead you to finding a way to respond to this fear. 

00:04:50
LYNN LYONS I never went to a therapist for this fear. What happened is I started going to trainings and I started going to, my first hypnosis training was with Michael Yapko in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. 

00:05:10
RICH SIMON Ok. 

00:05:10
LYNN LYONS And here he's talking about, you know, hypnotic process and it sort of dawned on me, Jeez, maybe there's something that I could teach myself about this. So I really was sort of self-taught. I started learning how to put myself into this little trance state, almost. A waking trance state. Really learning about what was happening physiologically in my body and learning how to deal with it in a way that, I'll tell ya, I remember very vividly the first time that I used it in a session and I'll talk to you later about the technique that I invented, for lack of a better word, that I teach kids. 

00:05:45
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay. Alright. 

00:05:45
LYNN LYONS There was a guy that came in, and he was coming, I don't even know what he was coming to me for. I can't even remember. It was 20 years ago. But he had this unbelievable propensity to witness car accidents. So you've got this medically... 

00:06:00
RICH SIMON A propensity to witness car accidents. I hadn't heard of people with a pronounced propensity for...I'm sorry, go ahead. 

00:06:10
LYNN LYONS So, so he would come to me. 

00:06:10
RICH SIMON He had bad luck. He had bad luck. 

00:06:10
LYNN LYONS Bad luck. Right. Right. Right. We did some reframing there and we called it his propensity to witness car accidents. 

00:06:15
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Okay. There you go. Okay. 

00:06:15
LYNN LYONS And so he would come in and we would exchange pleasantries and 50% of the time he'd want to report on a car accident that he witnessed which was, you know, you could imagine the poor guy's coming in to see me and I'm just dreading what he's gonna say next. And so I used, as he starts talking about this car accident and a guy going through a windshield and all the gruesomeness that that entails and I sat there and I felt my ears ringing which was the sign of things to come and I started using this technique that I had taught myself. And so he's going on and talking to me and I'm sort of listening to him but I'm really much more, it's all about me at this point. And I was able to regain my composure and I remember very vividly sitting there and thinking, you, you're doing it. You're doing it. You're managing it. You're handling it. And my confidence just went through the roof. I think I actually had to do that maybe three more times in a session, not all the time with him, before I began to really feel like I had a handle on it and once I felt like I had a handle on it I did. It was really just a matter of me having that experience a few times. 

00:07:30
RICH SIMON So, if you could, what is it that you did? How did you change this very intense pattern of response? 

00:07:35
LYNN LYONS Well, so the first thing that I did was, as I mentioned, the ringing in my ears, I realized that was the first physiological clue that things were gonna go down quickly, literally. And so I decided that when I heard the ringing in my ears that that would be a sign that it was time to use this technique. So rather than panic when I heard the ringing I would say to myself, oh, okay, get to work. Now is your time. Here is your moment. And I would focus on my right hand. Now, I'm right handed, I'm very right side, so why I picked my right hand, I don't know. Now, I had to be in therapy with people so my left hand would be okay and from here up I was okay but I would cue my right hand to get absolutely heavy and I would tell myself, when your hand gets heavy then this feeling of relaxation and calmness is gonna move up into your arm and elbow. The rest of my body would just go dead in the chair. Now, you wouldn't know I was doing it unless I was doing it so if I were talking to you and if you were watching it you might see my head drop a little bit, I might get a little less animated. I tend to be, you know, kind of like this. And I talk a little bit more, more quietly. But you wouldn't really know. It actually would probly look like I was really paying attention. You probly ha about 82% of me, not 100% and I would just focus on that hand and just bring myself down physiologically and then the internal talk would be, you can handle this. The person is talking to you but while they're talking to you, your heart rate is alright, your breathing is alright and so I would just start reassuring myself, this heavy hand as a cue or as an anchor, I was able to manage it. And like I said, I only had to do it maybe two or three times in a very formal way before I felt like a superhero. So, yeah. So I teach that to kids. 

00:09:40
RICH SIMON We'll come back to this and how you able to do this with kids who are with their parents. So let's, what we'll do here, what I hope to do is really give this audience a very vivid and immediate sense of not only of how you think about anxiety, at least the principles that organize your work, but also, what it would be like, how you actually work with kids and their parents. So begin with, one of the things that I know from what I've learned about your work is that, one of the things that you really challenge is that one has to be very, very serious about the problems of anxiety. So talk to us a little bit about the role of hyper seriousness in your view of anxiety and respective treatment. 

00:10:25
LYNN LYONS Yeah. Well, you could imagine if you specialize in anxiety and you work in anxiety we know that a lot of anxious kids have anxious parents too and even if they didn't start off anxious, you know, they're bringing their little kid into a therapist's office maybe for the first time, maybe for the fifth time. I saw somebody the other day and I was the fifth therapist. And they're generally, the kids I see, I see any age really but the big, there's a real chunk in the middle that's probably 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 years old. So you have this little cute as a button 7 year old come in and everybody's very serious and they sit in there and immediately I wanna just let them know that we've been taking this anxiety thing so seriously and that's what it wants. It wants to feel like it's in charge. It wants to rule the house and we're not gonna let that happen anymore. So immediately we start talking about being able to know when anxiety shows up and we're not really gonna be so surprised by it anymore. So I'll say to kids thing like, well, what does your anxiety say to you? You know, for example, a kid is afraid to go to sleep at night in a bed by themselves. Very common fear that little kids have that I see. So anxiety shows up and says, you're not going to be able to fall asleep. Maybe there's monsters under the bed. Maybe somebody's gonna come in the window and steal you and so I say to kids, whenever anxiety shows up and starts talking to you, you treat it like breaking news. So even though anxiety says the same thing to you over and over and over again, you're like, oh my gosh anxiety, I can't believe you just said that. I've never heard that before. And I'm like this in a session. Oh my god, anxiety, really? I might wet my pants on the bus? And I say, we've gotta start treating it as if we're bored. Really anxiety? So I'll say to a kid, tell me what your anxiety says and I'm gonna show you how to talk back. So they say, well anxiety says that the bus driver is gonna forget where I live and drop me off and I'm gonna be lost. And I'll say, how often does the anxiety say that to you. Oh, every time I get on the bus. And I say, you're surprised every time? Really? Come on. And I'll say, alright, so the anxiety says that to you and I'll say, oh, oh, oh I'm sorry anxiety. We're you saying something? We're you saying something? I'm sorry. Yeah. And so we play that way. I have this whole thing that I do with kids. We externalize the anxiety. We've got this worry part out here. We'll draw a picture and sometimes kids have little puppets or things that we use. I have a white board and I'm good at drawing cartoon faces and things. And I tell the kids that they probly don't know, there's a big church in Concord. This big old massive church. And I say that there's an anxiety group support meeting that happens the third Thursday every month and all the anxiety parts from all the different kids from the surrounding towns get together. There's usually brownies, maybe some lemonade, depending on the season and they all talk about how successful they've been at bossing the kids around. And I said, and you know, and I do this at the end of the first session. I say, you know, I can count on the fact that, and I'll change the date of the anxiety support meeting so it's the night after our session. Oh, oh my gosh, its Thursday the 30th, they're meeting tonight. I guarantee you, your anxiety part is gonna walk into that meeting, it's gonna sit down, it's gonna look like this. And everybody's gonna say, you know, Bud, what's up? And you're anxiety part is gonna say, my kid, you know, Trevor, I've been hanging out with, bossing around for the last 2 or 3 years, went to see Lynn Lyons. And all the anxiety parts are gonna go, no! He went to see Lynn Lyons! Oh no! No! And then somebody's gonna come over and their put his arm around your anxiety part, right, they're gonna, somebody's gonna bring him ice cream and a little glass of lemonade. But they know, the jig is up, right? We're not playing this game anymore. You know how it works, I know how it works. It's gonna be a bad day at the anxiety support group meeting tonight. And that's often how they leave the first session. One of the challenges with little kids is you've, you've gotta win 'em over and they've gotta wanna come back they've gotta want to do what you're gonna ask 'em to do cause it's not gonna feel good. So, that's sort of taking the seriousness out of it. 

00:14:45
RICH SIMON This atmosphere of play and fun and behaving in a way that adults are not supposed to behave. Makes a lot of since. 

00:14:50
LYNN LYONS I know I'm doing my job when it's time to reschedule the meeting and the kid says to me, the mom says, well, when can you see her? And I'll say, well I've got an opening in two weeks and the kid says, couldn't we come back sooner? How about tomorrow? Can we come back tomorrow? And to me that's a sign that not only have I gotten them invested in treatment but that I've made them feel safe and comfortable and this is the fun place to be. 

00:15:15
RICH SIMON Okay. So, Lynn, where, how far are, where are we in a first session? Is this something that you would do, what else might you need to do in a first session before to get to the point that you've just been describing for us? 

00:15:30
LYNN LYONS What I would do, I would do that at the end of a session and so all the stuff leading up to that is all the information that I've given them. So the way it would probly work is I start with, I made mention of kind of externalizing that worry part so that's really the first thing that I wanna do for a kid is I want them to get the idea very strongly and the parent's too that this anxiety is no who they are and we're gonna treat it like something that is really outside of themselves so they can hear it, they can look at it, they can experience it and they can have some distance from it. So first, we're gonna do a lot of the externalizing. I can't talk to them about their worry part going to a meeting until they've really bought into the fact that there's this worry part. So I'm gonna do a lot of that at the beginning. I'm going to, I'm gonna draw pictures, I'm gonna explain to them how anxiety works. How it starts with this thought... 

00:16:30
RICH SIMON So if you could Lynn, just, we're here, it's the first session, its early on in the session and you're introducing all of this in the way that you might introduce it to both the child and the parents. 

00:16:40
LYNN LYONS Okay. So I would say, so here you've got this anxiety, right, and it makes you feel certain ways and it feels so big and overwhelming and mysterious but here's the good news: it's not mysterious to me at all. So I'm gonna pull out my white board. I'm gonna show you exactly how it works. So we draw a face, I'm good at drawing little cartoon faces and try and make it look like them as much as I can and they're laughing and so I say, and you have this worried thought and so I'll draw a little thought bubble and the worry thought might be, I'm gonna throw up in class. Alright, so you're gonna throw up in class. So there's the worry thought. Now, you've got this alarm system, your amygdala, its five hundred million years old. That alarm system hears that worried thought and says, oh no. So from now on when those worried thoughts show up we're gonna call them, oh no thoughts. Some kids call 'em uh oh thoughts. So this is your uh oh thought and that's what gets the ball running. If I've told them the story about me fainting, which, maybe that won't come in but I'll say, whenever we have an uh oh thought sometimes our body reactions. Sometimes our stomach goes, errrrrrr. Sometimes our heart starts to pound. Sometimes our armpits get a little sweaty so we have this oh no thought. Now, you're listening to the oh no thought and you're saying, oh my god, oh gosh, right? And your alarm system gets turned on and your alarm system says, oh my gosh, Jason you're in danger, right. So now your alarm system, your body and your brain are all working together to save you from danger. But here's the thing, there's not really any danger. It's your imagination that's believing that there's danger. And I'll say to them, if there really was danger, if there really was, you know, you were a caveman and you were walking through the woods and the saber tooth tiger jumped out at you and went, rear. You know. And I don't use a, when I'm giving an example of danger, you'll notice I go back to a caveman and a saber tooth tiger. I'm not gonna say, you know, if there really were danger, like if you really were sleeping in your bed and a robber did come in and grab you. Not a good idea. 

00:18:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. Right. Got it. Yeah. 

00:18:50
LYNN LYONS But if there really were danger your system would work perfectly. The problem is, you keep turning on your alarm system and you keep having these oh no thoughts and there's not really danger. You imagine that there's danger but there's not and the problem is that when you go into danger mode and when you go into oh no mode you stop being a problem solver. And up here, and I have a picture of a brain I'll show them, up here, this is where you solve problems. When you're alarm system is turned on, your amygdala back here, you're not such a good problem solver. And I'll say, what's two times two and they go, four. What's the third letter of the alphabet? D. You say, right there. You just used the part of your brain that you need to solve problems. So when you hear that uh oh thought, when you hear that oh no thought, we need you to get back up here as quick as possible. Cause you need to figure out how to deal with the situation that's in front of you and you're not doing that very well right now which is why this thing gets bigger and bigger and bigger and why you're also worn out by it. So, that would be how I would introduce how we're gonna start talking about anxiety. 

00:20:05
RICH SIMON Lynn, what is it, so that's the focus we've been talking so far on the parents are hearing all of this but you're very much addressed initially to the child and trying to put all of this in the child's terms. How do you talk with the parents and what is it that you wanna make sure that they understand in addition to what you want the child to understand? 

00:20:25
LYNN LYONS Well and that's critical because usually we have a parent that either came in anxious themselves, this could be a really long family legacy or we've got a parent who's been trying desperately to get their child to feel better and they're usually doing the exact opposite of what I need them to do. Only because what you do when you have a child who's suffering and a child who's scared is you try and provide certainty and comfort. And we try and accommodate and we try to make things okay for the child which reinforces the anxiety in a rather remarkable and powerful way. So what I wanna tell parents is that you've got to start being okay with uncertainty. You've gotta start being okay with your child being uncomfortable so that they can learn how to manage these uh oh thoughts that come up. So I give you a really good example if you want. Kid comes in to see me. He is in 7th grade. He is smart as a whip. He's doing very well in school. Anxiety is not really controlling his life except in one very specific way: he's terrified of vomiting. And he lives his life like I used to live my life around the fear of gross stuff. He lives his life around the possibility that he could throw up. And it's almost gotten sort of OCDish cause he has certain superstitions if he puts his glass of water on the left side of his bed or if he wears these shoes and he's living his life trying to protect himself from throwing up. Which means in school he scans other people's faces to see if anybody is possibly coming down with a stomach virus. He listens, you know, he's got his ear to the throw up network. Who's got it? Who doesn't? 

00:22:15
RICH SIMON Uh huh. Okay. 

00:22:15
LYNN LYONS So, and starting to avoid anxiety while it's easy to avoid. So his mom's approached to this, which makes perfect sense when you don't know it makes perfect sense. Is he comes downstairs for breakfast, he walks into the kitchen and the first thing he says to mom is, do you think I'm gonna throw up today? Am I gonna be sick? Do you think I'm gonna throw up? And his mom says, no, no, no, no, no, you're not gonna throw up. And he says, okay. And he's a smart kid and he says, how do you know. And she says, well your color looks fine. How do you know my color looks fine? And he has to go look at his color, come back. I think I look a little pale. No, you don't look pale. You don't look pale. You look fine. 

00:22:50
RICH SIMON Oh my god. Yeah. 

00:22:50
LYNN LYONS So this is the thing. So it goes on all the time. So I said to the mom, the first thing I want you to do is when he comes down, he's sitting right there. When he comes down for breakfast tomorrow and he says, do you think I'm gonna throw up. I want you to say, you might, could, happens. People puke all the time. And mom is looking at me going. She's, oh no . I mean, how would I ever get him to school if I tell him he might throw up. And I said, because he might throw up. So the goal is not to convince him that he'll never throw up. He already knows that that's not gonna happen. He's a smart kid. The goal is to teach him, how do you handle the possibility in life that you're gonna puke, right? And so we started talking about that its gross to throw up and that we throw up at school. He said, what if I throw up at school and people talk. I go, they'll absolutely talk. A kid throwing up in class is big news for at least a day and a half. Right, then they move on to something else. You remember, remember they come with the sawdust and sprinkle it over the puke. I mean, that's big news. So, what would happen we.... 

00:23:50
RICH SIMON That's how they handle it in New Hampshire. The sawdust. We use chemicals in the southern part of the United States. But go ahead. You have a lot of trees up there. 

00:24:00
LYNN LYONS We use chemicals now too. We have, we even have wet vacs up here. We plug them into the wall. They work like a charm. So his, the shift that we had to make for him was that you might throw up and you will not like it and it will be gross. But when that uh oh thought shows up, when that oh no thought shows up, I want you to have a different response to it. So his homework assignment was that every time a throw up thought came up which was what if I throw up? He had to write down ten responses to it that said things like, yeah, that would stink. Or, I hope I don't get it on my shoes. Or, boy if I eat lasagna that would be really gross. And he had a good sense of humor and he got the hang of it. He comes back in two weeks. He's got 150 statements back to the anxiety. None of them are, I can't possibly handle it. All of them are along the lines of, throwing up is gross, I'm not gonna like it, it could happen and I'll deal with it. It's not gonna kill me. I saw him three times and off he goes into the world. So allowing kids to just have a different relationship with the anxiety and teaching the parents which is what you were asking me as well. How do we get rid of the certainty? How do we allow to be uncomfortable? 

00:25:25
RICH SIMON So we'll get back to the parents in a moment. But with things like your thing about blood or this guy's, this young man's reaction to vomit, is it at all critically profitable to find out where did this start and what the origins of these things are or is that something that is totally irrelevant from your viewpoint? 

00:25:50
LYNN LYONS No, it's not irrelevant but there is usually an event, well, let me rephrase that. There is infrequently an event that I can really say, oh this is where that started. And even if we do figure out what the event is, my treatment of that isn't really gonna be all that different. Now there are certainly situations where kids come in and they've gone through some sort of trauma or they've seen something. I've had a few kids over the years that have been in house fires and that certainly leads to a specific anxiety developing. But there, more often than not, that specific content is sort of where the anxiety is hanging out that month of that year and so this boy, he was really focused on vomiting but if I get a history mom says, well when he was four he was really afraid to sleep in his own bed and when he was seven he got really afraid of snakes for a while and when he was eight he got really worried that he would step in dog doo and bring it into the house. So usually the content is not as, with kids that are anxiety focused, it's a moving target. 

00:27:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. It's not, it's not terribly revealing and you're finding its not a particularly profitable pathway to go down. 

00:27:15
LYNN LYONS Right. Right. And I avoid the pathway of, lets go back and talk about how all this started. So my history taking in an initial appointment, for one its really boring for kids when they come in for me to take an extensive history and secondly, I usually can get what I need in maybe about seven minutes. My goal is to start teaching this family what they need to know right away. 

00:27:40
RICH SIMON So let's stay with the parents for a moment. We'll come back to the kid cause we're talking with the child. We're talking about, you want to move them towards this sense of mastery that they can handle whatever it is that may not be the ideal thing to happen in their life but they'll survive it and they can handle it. We'll come back to that in a moment but will the parents see your part of it is they're trying to block this pattern of reassurance and they wanna take this away from their child. They wanna reassure the kid. What else are you focusing on with the parents. What else about the parent's mode of responding at that pattern do you want to change? 

00:28:20
LYNN LYONS The other thing is that anxiety's incredibly frustrating and what happens when kids are very emotionally reactive to whatever they're anxious about so they're not going to school, they're not going to bed, they won't go to birthday parties. Parents get really, really frustrated and really angry about that and sometimes just very distraught. So you've got a parent who raises their voice, who bursts into tears, who really escalates the situation. So one of the things that I teach parents really early on is you've gotta be calm. You've gotta be the eye of the hurricane here. So, I talked to you about the heavy hands thing. Usually when I'm doing that with the child, the parent is sitting right next to the kid and I'll do it too. And I will say to them, you know, you might use this as well. So, really allowing them to have some practice sort of staying calm. The other thing too, is they're really, really worried that there's something horribly wrong with their kid and there's nothing really more reassuring than me saying, oh yeah I've heard that before. You know, she doesn't do this and she has this and she has that. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean that's just the way it goes. So really letting the parent know that their emotional temperature is critical. You know, it's this old story, the little kid falls down and bloodies his knee and he stands up and he's fine and then mom looks at it. If she's me she passes out. Mom looks at it and goes, oh my gosh, right and then phoom, off they go. So the parents really need, really need to learn how to stay calm. We know from the literature that overprotective parents and overcritical parents that has a real impact on the development of anxiety disorders. So helping the parents use different language in the way that they talk about the world, in the way that they give their child warnings. You know, so you send your kid off on their bike. My son fell off his bike last spring on his way to school in the road and broke his arm and his friend comes running back home and says you know, Bracket's in the road and something's wrong and so, of course, he heals and the he wants to get back on his bike and ride to school. So as a mom I can either say, now remember, remember when you broke your arm. Remember, that was so terrifying for us all. Hang on to the handlebars. Or I can say, hey, you know what I'm gonna say, let's try both hands on the handlebars this time buddy. And I model for parents the difference in how we talk to the world about their kids and that's huge for parents. 

00:31:00
RICH SIMON So say about that. How we talk to the world about kids. What's that part? 

00:31:05
LYNN LYONS I think I said that wrong. Talk to kids about the world. So here, kids are out in the world and how we talk to them about the world, it's not about protecting them from things but it's about giving them that message that, yeah, things can happen. Yeah, it could happen. But how are you gonna handle it? 

00:31:25
RICH SIMON So there are all kinds of patterns one can observe in the families of anxious kids and anxious parents who are either themselves anxious or tend to have anxious kids. There are temperamental dimensions to all this and the way you're talking about this you seem to be inclined towards the viewpoint that the particulars are less important. The fact that some children are wired, some people are wired to be anxious and so on. But in terms of what you're actually are doing, that's in your head. But your assumption through this is, it's not gonna help that much to do that and basically there are some basic things, you wanna hit the ground running. You wanna make sure that you get people to start doing things differently very quickly in a first session with you. 

00:32:10
LYNN LYONS Right. Very quickly. I see kids 90 minutes the first time. I don't wanna rush through. If there is important history to be taken or information that should be shared with me I'll tell the parents to just send me an email before they come in. But I wanna, you're exactly right, I wanna hit the ground running. I want, after that first session, I want the parents and the children to know exactly what anxiety is up to and to have at least three or four good strategies that they can use within that first two weeks. I see kids sometimes weekly but it's usually every other week. A week goes by quickly. I want them to be able to sink their hands and their feet and their brains into doing something differently. So it's very experiential. 

00:32:55
RICH SIMON So what are the kinds of. You gave us one example. A big part of what you do is these homework assignments. So it's not enough to just come in and lets have a chat about this situation. You, every session that you would have with a kid and with the parents, you'd have them do something in addition to what you. So talk to us about these homework assignments and the kinds of homework assignments and how you match a particular assignment, perhaps, to a certain kind of situation and address some kind of pattern. 

00:33:30
LYNN LYONS Okay. So a very typical pattern that I might see in a family is rigidity. Anxious families tend to be very rigid. If the parents are rigid that means there's a lot of rules. Those are the families that I might see where there's a lot of anxiety about performance. A lot of anxiety about getting homework done. A lot of worry about making mistakes and that kind of stuff. And that's very common. So, assignment that I would give is we make the wall of flexibility. I have to give credit, I have a good friend Christine and she came up with the wall of brotherly love and I just changed it to the wall of flexibility for my purposes. You take a bunch of post it notes. We pick a wall, a section of wall in the house. It might be the kitchen door. It might be the bathroom door. And every time that mom or dad notices the child doing something flexibly, they write it down on the post it note and they put it on the wall. So, anxious kids like their routines and many parents will come in and say, boy, if he thinks that we're going to, you know, Joe's and then Joe gets the flu and so we're gonna change our play date, we're gonna go Sylvia's, he loses it. So the idea is to talk to the parents about flexibility. About how it is that we can teach a child to go with the flow basically. So there's this great visual, it's up on the walls and we decide that, you know, depending on the age of the kid, 5 stickies or ten stickies or twenty stickies and then you get a prize. The prize is something fun with the family. You know, you could go play miniature golf. You can order a pizza and you get to pick the toppings. There's a family movie, pick the family movie. Things like that. So the family and then the parents are learning this flexibility too. Now, of course what happens is if dad is really inflexible about things, it doesn't take long for a seven year old boy to come back and say, I think dad needs a wall of flexibility too. And I'll say, oh my gosh, that is a brilliant idea. I think he does too. So that would be a very typical early homework assignment that I would give. 

00:35:35
RICH SIMON Systems intervention. Okay, great. 

00:35:40
LYNN LYONS The other thing along the lines of needing certainty is the what I know and the what I don't know list which is one of the homework assignments I think every kid that comes to see me probly gets this one. So I take a piece of paper. I draw a line down the middle. There's what I know on one side, what I don't know on the other side and they start listing them. So, first day of school. What I know: well, I know that I'm going to Millbrook Elementary School, I know my teacher Mrs. Barassa, I know that Freddy is in my class, I know my mom is gonna pack peanut butter and jelly. What don't you know? So then we start making this list and then we get a little silly. You don't know what color shoes Mrs. Barassa's gonna have on the first day of school, you don't know what day gym is gonna be, you don't know what day art is gonna be, you don't know exactly who's gonna be in your class, you don't know if there's gonna be any new kids. So by the time we finish we've got a list of what I knows about this long but we've got a list about what I don't knows about this long. And then every time they take the list with them and every time they, oh, oh, what I don't know becomes a what I know, they just take a pencil and they take an arrow and they move it over to the other side. And I say, now I want you to talk this list with you first day of school or it could be going for a sleepover, who knows. You know, it doesn't matter. Content doesn't matter. And then they bring the list back to me and what happens when they come back is that they got a list and all the what I don't knows have an arrow to the what I knows and it's just a visual representation of when we go into new things we don't know everything but experience allows us to discover and problem solved. And then it gets silly, you know, like, if I don't know if a pigeon is gonna poop on my head, I don't know if a dragon is gonna eat my sandwich. I say, oh, that's a great one. I never thought of that one before. Then they come home and I say, did the dragon eat your sandwich. Oh, no. Thank goodness, that would have been something. Yeah. So that kind of playfulness. 

00:37:40
RICH SIMON I'll have to, that's an exercise that you can assign to me. It sounds like it would be very profitable for all of us. That's great. Are there any other of these sort of classic assignments that are useful quite generally. 

00:37:55
LYNN LYONS Well certainly the four B's is kind of my take it home thing. And the four B's stand for body, brain, bravery and bridge. And body is talking about the things we talked about before. The physiology. Teaching them what their body does. Helping with the mind body connection. I'm gonna make a heavy hands CD for them the first time that they come in. I'm gonna record on my computer and give them the CD of us going through the heavy hands exercise so they learn the role of their body in this whole anxiety thing. Cause that's what freaks what most kids out. It's the somatic symptoms that really freak them out. So, and then the second thing, the brain, that's the thinking, that's the whole thing I talked about with the uh oh thoughts, and the oh no thoughts and how the anxiety sets off the alarm system and how to talk back to it and all that kind of stuff. Third thing is the bravery, that's with the throwing up kid, right. Hey, you're gonna throw up sometimes even though you don't like it. You're gonna have to step into it. So, the phrase that I say to kids. 

00:39:10
RICH SIMON You may want to avoid that particular metaphor and with that symptom but I think I understand what you're saying. Okay. 

00:39:15
LYNN LYONS Or not. Or perhaps I should talk about it with you. Or not. 

00:39:20
RICH SIMON That doesn't mean you have to step in it. Okay. 

00:39:20
LYNN LYONS Right. Right. Right. But, you know, I don't like it but I can handle it. So having that sense of bravery that whenever you normalizing how it feels to step into a new situation and that you need to sort of go in and find what you need and then the bridge. That's to deal with the fact that worried kids get great amnesia and it sprinkles and the worry fairy sprinkles the amnesia dust on their brain and they forget that they've handled something before. So building reminder bridges. I talk to them about being able to go back and remember what you've done before because that counts. It allows you to learn what is going to happen next. So that's a big part of the four B's. They all get the four B's. We write them down. The more advanced version if I were dealing with a 12 or a 13 year old would be the expect, expect the worry to show up, externalize it and then experiment. You've gotta get out there and do because anxious kids have been really good at sort of avoiding being in the world. So those would be, that would be another very... 

00:40:25
RICH SIMON And how would, how are these presented? So, with the four B's, so I'm understanding the other assignments. And this, it sounds like, these seem more like, less than an assignment than a kind of mnemonic to help, help people, help their kids and their parents just keep in mind the framework that. Go ahead. 

00:40:50
LYNN LYONS What I would do as an assignment for them is I would, if I were talking about the four B's I would record it on the CD for them and they like to, you know, six year old like to listen and their voice is on the CD which they really get a kick out of too. They feel like they're rock stars. So you have to, I want you to listen to the CD. The other device I use all the time is if one parent is in the session and the other parent for whatever reason, was it work or whatever, that their job is to take the four B's, I write them down on a piece of paper and I want you to go home and explain them to your dad so that he can understand what we're talking about too. And then I may give an assignment that every time you use one of these I want you to put a little smiley face next to it and bring the paper back. So they'll come back. I go, oh my gosh, you figured out how to handle your body 12 times. You were brave 7 times. That is unbelievable! So, there's a lot of sending out and reporting back, for sure. Yeah. 

00:41:55
RICH SIMON So what's the, so this, it may be that in the first session you might get too much of what we've been talking about so far. 

00:42:05
LYNN LYONS Yes. Yeah. 

00:42:05
RICH SIMON So you have an extended period of time and you really wanna make sure have these tools. Now, in terms of the, so what does it look like, treatment with you? Do problems tend to resolve themselves in a relatively, in just a very few sessions? Give us a flavor of kind of the range and the patterns of outcome that you experience and what are the factors that seem to influence that? 

00:42:30
LYNN LYONS So, my expectation is that if I give it everything I've got during those first 90 minutes and I've got a family that is low hanging fruit which tired anxious families with 7 year old are pretty low hanging fruit. 

00:42:45
RICH SIMON They're willing to accept your authority huh? 

00:42:50
LYNN LYONS Yeah. Right. I wanna see significant improvement, notable improvement between the first and second session. I want them to come back and say, we started doing what you told us to do and we really, she's going to school or she went to school and she stayed for a half a day where she wasn't able to stay for at all. So, I set the bar high in terms of the expectations of what I'll see during the first and second session. I feel like momentum and energy are critical to the work that I do. So, certainly kids who have kind of a generalized anxiety disorder who sort of worry about everything, I will, I mean and there are kids I've been seeing for three years. They may check in every, you know, once a month or so, but their content jumps around and they need to come in and, I really don't teach them too much new when they come in. We just sort of review what they've done and I'll say, well it sounds like you could have used the what I don't know and what I don't know and they go, oh yeah, I could have used that. Okay, thanks. I would say for things that were very circumscribed like the vomiting phobia, as I said, I saw him three times. I think he came back once several months later because he had had a real peer issue and he wanted some advice and I was a trusted person. So, with something like that three, four five, six sessions. You know, my goal is to get things moving and to get the kids out of therapy. And then the second thing is I want the parents to know what they're supposed to do. This isn't rocket science and if I can teach them the tools so that they know how to cue their kids so that they're aware of the patterns that they're falling into that when the content changes and the symptoms flare up, they know what to do. I don't want them to rely on me as the person that has the magic answers. I say to them, I'm teaching you what I know and you're an intelligent competent parent and I know you can do it. So, you know, with OCD and things like that, of course I have ongoing relationships with many kids that I see but when a kid comes in the office I want momentum and energy and I want them to have improvement very quickly. 

00:45:10
RICH SIMON So are these distinctions of sorts of anxiety of OCD versus phobia versus generalized anxiety versus social anxiety, are those in distinctions other than a package of symptoms that people are presenting to you. Is there something else about those diagnostic categories that's important for the therapist to attend to over and above this kind of attention to the family pattern that you've been talking about and this focus on mastery? 

00:45:45
LYNN LYONS I think the difference with phobias is that as much as I downplay content that if there's a specific phobia then we have to talk about the content. You know I'm very much content, content isn't as important as process in all of this. How the anxiety works is much more interesting to me than what the anxiety is talking about. But with phobia you're gonna have to talk about the content a little bit more so that's one little difference. But I will tell kids, you know, the content could jump and it might be moved to something else and this can be used in other content, other contexts as well. But not so much with the other. I don't make a whole lot of distinction diagnostically except OCD seems to carry with it its own challenges. There is such a clear genetic component to that. The content of OCD stuff can be more disturbing to families and more bizarre and so we have to deal with that a little bit. Its pretty powerful and I'm very conservative with medication with kids but for somebody who comes in with a real significant OCD thing going on I want to have them be referred more immediately for a medeval. Which for a phobia or a general anxiety or a social anxiety I'm not gonna do that right away. So those would be some of the differences in my treatment plan that I have. 

00:47:20
RICH SIMON So, two things. One is with medications then from what you've said just now, you'll explore all the more purely non medication interventions and then medication is the last resort if you feel like you're not making headway? The kids are failing. 

00:47:35
LYNN LYONS Yeah. Except for when kids are really, really impaired with OCD. Then I would do that much, recommend that much quicker. 

00:47:45
RICH SIMON With the OCD your saying, in terms of your approach with OCD and you're saying that the content the kid might have, thoughts that might be difficult to be able to verbalize and the parents might not be able to handle. Is there a case that comes to mind that gives us a flavor for what the OCD introduces into this process that we haven't gone over so far? 

00:48:10
LYNN LYONS Yeah. An example would be a kid who came to see me who was doing sort of what we've heard in terms of the washing. So he was going to bed at night and he was coming down for breakfast in the morning. He was in 7th grade and his arms were literally raw. I mean, red and chapped and just, and his parents, it took a while for his parents to figure out what was going on so often times there's the visit to the dermatologist and to this and to that and not really getting what's going on because he's not being forthcoming about it. And so it was a contamination issue for him. What happened was school was a place that he believed was where the contamination was. And so he was, it was a school refusal thing. So why won't he go to school? He was getting very violent when his parents tried to make him go to school. He was running away from home. So when he came to me there was a picture of a kid with sort of, some sort of skin issue going on, that they didn't know what that was about. There was an issue with some real behavioral problems, some real violence, I mean he was hitting and kicking and then the school refusal thing. So, that can be sort of one of those complicated OCD cases where when I step back and look at it and I start saying, are you worried that there's something in school that's gonna get on you? And he sort of says, yeah. Another interesting thing is his mom started volunteering in the school. So he would have nothing to do with her. He started going into his room and he wouldn't let her come in. If she brought in the clean laundry and put it on his bed he wouldn't wear those close. And so with the OCD, one of the challenges is, being able to help the family identify what's going on because the behaviors can look so oppositional and so bizarre. A lot of kids in schools are diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder. They're diagnosed with ADHD. They're diagnosed with all these other things going on. It's because the OCD is so incredibly powerful and dominating virtually all aspects of their lives. Yeah, so you can probly get the sense that when a little kid comes in and sort of won't sleep in her own bed. You know, for me, yay! That's alright lets knock this out of the park. When a child like this other boy came in and its sort of, everybody's overwhelmed and the symptoms are so sever and so debilitating. Then, you know, I sort of have to settle in for a longer haul. It's just, it's just so, so powerful when it shows up. 

00:50:45
RICH SIMON So, what I'm, earlier as you were talking about it and we were saying that this goal is tolerance of uncertainty and getting the parents to not be so reassuring and then developing, slowly through all these lovely, delightful exercises the sense of mastery and autonomy on the part of the kid. It seemed like a lot of anxiety I could easily see how a lot of anxiety symptoms are dressed by that. What are you trying to address when its OCD? Is it the same issue of mastery and autonomy an parents and dealing with uncertainty given a certain genetic predisposition or what's the, is there, is it just the same only more intense or is there another dimension that we need to think about? 

00:51:35
LYNN LYONS I think probly to say the same but more intense would be accurate and I think the key when you're dealing with OCD is the externalization. That there is an OCD voice, you know, sort of that worry part that is so demanding and the problem with OCD is that when you don't follow through with, you know, the way I describe it to kids is, okay, we call it OCD right? So the O, that's the voice that says you have to do this and then the C, that's the thing you have to do and when you do it you feel so much better. And so being able to hear the O, know that that's your OCD but then not do the C, that's gonna make you feel really anxious. That's gonna make you feel really uncomfortable. And so we need to work so that you can tolerate the rising anxiety when you don't listen to OCD's rules, when you talk back, when you say I've had enough, you will get worse with your anxiety. You will feel badly and then being able to tolerate that and come down the other side. So that's a real big part. The externalization of it and the same, the entire, you know, if a kid says, I need to touch my doorknob five times or my mom is gonna get sick and die, you've gotta convince them that if you don't touch the doorknob mom is gonna be okay. And you're gonna have to tolerate the uncertainty of, that during that period of time of, is mom gonna be okay? Is mom gonna be okay? It's gonna take a while for you to be able to trust that that's gonna be okay and that's gonna feel really uncomfortable. So it's the same general principles but we just shift it a little bit more with the OCD. But I would say in general it's pretty, pretty similar in terms of what I'm trying to teach a kid. 

00:53:30
RICH SIMON So, it's a matter of this voice, is more stubborn, more relentlessly insistent? It doesn't let up. The other kinds of, as you were earlier on, you were doing the voices and it seems like you're trying to create some leeway by that externalization. With the OCD kids, if you do that, they're not gonna be reassured. They're not gonna smile. They're not gonna think, oh yeah, that's. They don't get a big kick out of the support meeting for fears the same way that these other kids do. 

00:54:10
LYNN LYONS Right. And it's interesting cause even as I'm talking about it I can feel sort of my demeanor changes when I start talking about kids with OCD compared to, you know, I guess probably, it is scarier and I think that making it playful right away, you know there are kids that come to see me that have intrusive thoughts that are really, really scary. They feel, they worry that they're gonna kill their mom. They're worried they have this intrusive thought that they're gonna throw their baby brother down the stairs and so I guess, probably the reason that you're picking up on my less playful tone is that it feels very, very scary in a way that perhaps it doesn't for the kids who won't go to school. I mean that's scary for them but... 

00:54:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. No, no. Yes, no. I'm really there. So are those that, in your experience, are those OCD cases, are those generally speaking, are those tougher to see some change in the patterns? 

00:55:10
LYNN LYONS I would say tougher. 

00:55:15
RICH SIMON Slower to respond? 

00:55:15
LYNN LYONS Slower to respond. I mean, I definitely will see things if they've never had any education about the OCD. I've had people come to me and they don't even know what OCD is. They just know that their kid is acting so strangely. And with that psychoeducation and with some initial work on externalization I can see some big jumps right away. Maintaining is harder. I would say the OCD kids are the kids I would see for a long period of time. They need to come and check in. Rarely, there are few times when a kid comes in with some real strong OCD symptoms and maybe one or two sessions and they've got it knocked out of the park. But it is slower to respond and it just is, it's like this weed we have in my garden that just is so tenacious and you think you've got it and it grows back. So I feel like there's more maintenance. The other thing with OCD is there's such a strong genetic family history that there's a really good chance that I've got a parent who has it as well and that makes treatment slower and a little trickier. 

00:56:25
RICH SIMON And you said before that these are the cases where you tend, where medication has more of a role. And what sorts of medication and what role does the medication play in working with these kids and these families? 

00:56:40
LYNN LYONS Well, the one medication that's been approved for the use of kids is, Zoloft is very popular medication that's used for OCD. P Prozac too but the, most of the time I'd say when kids are started on one of those SSRI's there's loosening of the obsessive power and it calms things down a little bit but I, when I do parenting workshops I'm very clear that I do not think a child should be on a psychotropic medication and not be receiving good psychotherapy at the same time. You know, some strong psychotherapy with real concrete skills is really necessary. 

00:57:20
RICH SIMON So we've been talking about kids who are, for whatever reason, genetic [00:57:30 tenacity, the pattern, are difficult, but as we're bringing our conversation to a close, what are you finding out as the family therapist? What are the tougher family patterns to try to challenge or change? 

00:57:45
LYNN LYONS I think probably, if I were to say, you know, day in and day out sitting with families is a real rigid parent who is very perfectionistic and who doesn't buy into the idea that you can have uncertainty in life. Parents who are very achievement oriented and so it's their own anxiety I think that comes into that. But they really are putting a lot of that onto their kids. And so what I'm saying to a parent like that, look you gotta let 'em screw up. You're trying to step in and make sure that he makes no mistakes, so stop checking his homework and let the teacher. And so a parent who's really anxious and really rigid and can't imagine that their son or daughter get a B on their report card, those are the ones that are the hardest to deal with because they're very invested in the way anxiety works. They're buying in to the structure that anxiety is providing and the rules that anxiety is providing so those are the challenging ones. 

00:58:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. And you're offering an implicit model of the world that they're not willing, and as you say, sometimes there's low hanging fruit and these parents are worn out, yeah, okay, we'll try it Lynn's way. And other people have more of an investment and are not so easily convinced. 

00:59:10
LYNN LYONS Correct. Correct. 

00:59:10
RICH SIMON Thank you for this fun and very interesting tour of the way in which you approach your work and the way you work with these kids and their families. So tell us if those people who are in the in the audience, for those who are interested in following up and finding out more about training materials and training opportunities and things that you've read. Where do they go? 

00:59:35
LYNN LYONS So my website is LynnLyonsNH.com. The NH stands for New Hampshire and I had to put it in, I don't know if I told you this, but when I got my domain name it was LynnLyons.com was a writer of erotic material so I couldn't go with that. So LynnLyonsNH.com. Make sure you put that in there. I've got a video that's available on the web. 

01:00:00
RICH SIMON You're the PG rated Lynn Lyons. Okay. Good, good. We'll remind people of that. 

01:00:05
LYNN LYONS And it's not the same person. I don't have an second career. 

01:00:10
RICH SIMON It's not a second career. Okay. 

01:00:10
LYNN LYONS Right. Not yet anyway. There's a video on my website that you can download at decreasing anxiety, how to talk to your anxious kid. It's a video link. I also have hard copies for people but you can go on the website ad see it. I made it for parents. It's about 45 minutes long and it's basically a first session with me with drawings and this is what to do. So that's available and its helpful for parents to watch with kids and anybody who wants to get more familiar with the way I do things. It's all right there. 

01:00:45
RICH SIMON Okay and you do training workshops and you will be with us this March and the networker symposium and I know you'll be at Jack Hirose brief therapy meeting. 

01:01:00
LYNN LYONS Yep. I'll be in Canada, Reid Wilson and I will be up in Canada doing some trainings for school personnel and therapists up in Canada. I do parenting workshops. I do workshops for what I call, one that's called, worried about your worrier, which is very popular. And I do, I do that wherever want me to. Allot of around New England where parents come and I basically lay out what I've laid out for you today and try to teach parents... 

01:01:25
RICH SIMON And so all these events people, these are listed on your website. 

01:01:30
LYNN LYONS Yep. On my website. 

01:01:30
RICH SIMON So last thing. Again a reminder to every one of our comment board. Here's your opportunity. Do it your yourself. Take a moment. Put it into language. What stood out for ya. What you learned. What things that you may wanna try differently in your own work? And also, questions you may have. Connection you've made between what Lynn has talked about. Something else you're thinking. Whatever it is, you befit by putting it down and putting it into, expressing it, putting it into language. We all benefit by seeing the thoughts other people have and a bonus you get is Lynn has agreed to look at the comment board and if you ask a really terrific question of relevance to all of us, you may get a response. So, take a moment at the end of this and please make your contribution to our comment board. Lynn, a delightful conversation, really interesting. I'll never think about anxiety when I do my certainty and uncertainty list as soon as we're off the air here. I'm sure it'll make a big difference on my own anxiety. 

01:02:35
