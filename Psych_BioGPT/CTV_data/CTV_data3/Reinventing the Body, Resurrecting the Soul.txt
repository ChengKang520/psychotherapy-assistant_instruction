BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG  Professor Chopra is going to be talking to us about reinventing the body and resurrecting the soul. And to start to speak about Professor Chopra would be a daunting task. And he's the author of more than 50 books they're translated into 35 languages, numerous New York Times bestsellers. As an endocrinologist, he was a fellow of the American College of Physicians. And he is credited as being one of the top icons of the century, and the poet-prophet of alternative medicine. And his effect on public consciousness, that's incalculable. His New York Times bestseller is one thing, but here's a cartoon. So when you get to the stage where you're used as an icon in a cartoon, I suppose that really says something about how you've permeated the public consciousness. Did you see this before? 

00:00:50
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA No. No. 

00:00:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG The ending is you see your suffering is the PC condition. So here let's ask you these questions and you can reflect on them for a moment. Do you want to have everyday immortality? Do you want to reinvent the body? Do you want to know the seven spiritual laws of success? Do you want to have an ageless body? Do you want to know the path to love? Do you want to: grow younger; live longer; have perfect health; experience everyday immortality; realize the journey into healing; have fire in the heart, power, freedom and grace; know why God is laughing; realize the spontaneous fulfillment of desire; realize perfect weight; understand creating affluence; have boundless energy, perfect digestion; and, yes, even experience golf for enlightenment? Well, if you want to have those things, then listen mindfully, because the Professor Chopra's going to tell us about all of these things. Now, he was, uh, just on -- which television program were you on where you announced the Evolution Conference, just the other night? You were on? 

00:02:05
DEEPAK CHOPRA Um, CNN last night. 

00:02:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG CNN, um-hum, and announced twice the Evolution Conference. And now, uh, a little bit of a skit that is absolutely priceless. And Dr. Chopra's allowed us to play this. It was NBC News on Conan O'Brien. And you're going to see expert psychoanalysis of Conan O'Brien by Deepak Chopra.

00:03:35
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA I can't speak louder. Can we turn up the volume, please? Can you hear me? 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:03:40
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA Okay. So I know that, uh, Jeff has given you a very complete introduction, and I just want to spend a few minutes telling you how I happen to be here on the stage, talking about the soul today more than anything else. I'm a physician by training. I went to medical school in India. And when I was in my final year, we were being recruited, uh, in -- by hospitals in the United States to come here for training. There was a shortage of physicians because the Vietnam war was coming to an end, and all the physicians in this country were in the army at that time. India was discouraging us from leaving, so we had foreign-exchange regulations where you couldn't leave the country with more than $8. I had, uh, an uncle in London who lent me $100. And if you know anything about Indian mythology, then 108 is a very auspicious number. We have 108 mantras, 108 beads on the mala, 108 rituals. So I thought I should do something really auspicious with my $108. And I went to Paris and I spent it all in one night at the Moulin Rouge. So when I arrived in New York, I had nothing. But this is one of the most creative countries in the world, so one of the first things I learnt was that you have a custom called the collect call. So I made a collect call to my hospital administrator; I said, 'If you really want a physician tonight, then you'll have to pick me up.' And they were so desperate that they sent me a helicopter. So my first experience of, uh, the United States was lifting off in a helicopter in New York, JFK, looking out of the window, twilight, looking at the New York skyline, the Manhattan skyline. And I thought maybe this was Disney World. Anyway, 20 minutes later I was in a small place called Plainfield, and, um, I reported to the emergency room, where I was supposed to start my first rotation. And the nurse told me that she would call me when my shift started, I should just go to the dorm and rest a bit, get over my jet lag. So I went to the dorm and I switched on the television set. And when I left India, there was no TV in India. This is 1970. And this is the first time I had seen a television program, and this was in color. So I was totally captivated. I was watching Wimbledon when the program was suddenly interrupted. There was a news bulletin; some policemen had been wounded at a local bank where there was a burglary, a holdup, and they had been grievously wounded. They were being brought to the emergency room where I was going to start working. Now, I had passed all my exams, but I had actually never seen a patient. So I had my first attack of acute panic. Shortly thereafter, the nurse called me and she said, 'Dr. Chopra, we have an expiration.' I had no idea what that word meant, but of course I didn't want to let on, so I said, 'You bet, I'll be there.' And I quickly bounded down the stairs, I put on my most cheery manner, said, 'I'm here.' And she showed me into a room where there was a dead person. There were lots of machines, no people. In India, of course, there were always lots of people and no machines. And I looked at the nurse and I looked at this dead body, and I said to the nurse, 'He's dead.' And she said, 'I told you we had an expiration.' So at least now I knew what the word meant. But I still did not know what she wanted me to do. If a patient is already dead, why do you need a doctor? So I finally said to her, I said, 'If he's already dead, what should I do?' And she looked at me very sternly, she pointed her finger at me like this and she said, 'Pronounce him.' I knew I was definitely in a different galaxy where your soul could not leave your body till a medical deity, otherwise known as "MD", said, uh, 'You're free now. I release you. Please go.' But of course, you know, as my friend Jean Houston will tell you that medical doctors are no different in many ways from shamans, and we have our own rituals, we have our own mythical stories. We don't wear leopard skins; we wear white coats. We don't have feathers around our neck; we wear a stethoscope. Uh, we don't dance around a fire; we dance round a PET scanner, or a CAT scanner. We don't use Aborigine mantras; we use Latin mantras. But we're shamans too. So I knew she wanted me to do all my rituals: examine the pupils, listen to the heart, even in the face of the obvious. And having learnt English in India, which is a little similar to English English, I asked the nurse for a torch, which is the English word for a flashlight. So I said to the nurse, 'May I have a torch, please?' She said, 'A what? So by now there were lots of people outside watching us. And my nurse looked at this nurse outside and she said, 'He wants a torch.' And she looked me up and down and she said, uh -- she whispered to everyone around her; she said 'Maybe he wants to do a cremation.' So, anyway, it was a bit of a rocky start. But in about seven hours I was totally addicted to the atmosphere in the emergency room; I just loved it. And I totally understand now why people like to watch programs like "ER" and the whole melodrama of the emergency room. Um, furthermore, I was, uh, very quickly discovering that I had surgical skills. So I couldn't wait for the next patient. And the more wounded they were, the more I relished it. I was like a ravenous, bloodthirsty hound waiting for the next trauma patient. And I had no idea what was going on in the inner life of these patients; I just loved the atmosphere. So that started my career. And, uh, it took me a very long time to realize that, um, we had a system of medicine that, um, trained us to be superb technicians who knew everything about the human body, but lousy healers because we had no idea about the human soul or the human spirit. 

00:12:10
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA  So I'm very privileged to be with you today talking about resurrecting the soul in medicine. As you all, I'm sure, know, the word "psyche" comes from the Greek goddess Psyche, the Goddess of Soul. So psychotherapy is really the science that is evolving and maturing to that realm that we call the spirit. And that's what I'd like to talk about today. I went on from Plainfield, New Jersey to Boston. I trained at many of the Boston hospitals associated with all the major universities there. And my training took me to the field of, first, internal medicine, and then endocrinology, and ultimately neuroendocrinology. And there were many things happening in my field in the 1970s. First of all, there was a new technique that had been discovered, and, uh, the person who had discovered the technique, Rosalyn Yalow, got the Nobel prize in physiology and medicine. It was the technique that we today call radioimmunoassay. We were able to measure, um, chemicals, or you might say neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, in the biological systems of the human body. So that was the first thing that was happening. So we were measuring these everywhere. And, um, it was obvious to some of us that, uh, the chemicals that we were measuring were actually the messengers of -- and I say messengers of consciousness, that neurotransmitters and neuropeptides were actually the molecules of emotion. So that was the first thing that was becoming obvious to us. And one of my colleagues was a scientist that you may have heard of, Candace Pert, who later went on to become the chief of brain chemistry at the National Institutes of Health and then at Georgetown. And in fact, she was the first one to discover the opiate receptor, and one of the first ones to use the term "neuropeptide", "neuro" because these were in the brain, and "peptides" because these are protein molecules. And because it was so easy to measure them, we were looking for them everywhere in the body. And the first thing that we looked at was the immune system, and it was very clear that the cell walls of the immune system had receptors to neuropeptides. So somebody inside you, or maybe not inside you - we'll look at that in a moment - but somebody there is having a conversation with themselves all the time. You're having a conversation with yourself all the time; it goes on in your sleep, it goes on in your dreams, it goes on in your waking state. And, um, your immune cells are actually eavesdropping on that conversation. In a moment I'm going to see if we can help us figure out who this person is who's having this conversation. But I think you'll agree, whoever it is, he or she or it never shuts up. The conversation is going on all the time, and the immune cells are eavesdropping. Well, it turned out that as we started to look at this phenomenon, not only do immune cells listen in on the conversation, they participate in the conversation, because immune cells - T cells, B cells, macrophages, leukocytes - they all make the same peptides that the brain makes when you think. If you ask a good neurobiologist today what's the essential difference between the immune system and the nervous system, they'll say 'There isn't any. The immune system is a circulating nervous system.' Immune cells are conscious beings, if you will. They remember; they remember past experiences; they remember the experiences of their ancestors. When an immune cell looks at a pneumococcus, it asks itself 'Should I go after this fellow, or should I leave him alone? What was my last experience with this chap? Uh, and if I haven't met him before, what did my grandfather think of him?' Immune cells have memory; they make choices. They have all the attributes of consciousness. They don't think in English with an Indian accent, but they have all the attributes, as I said, of consciousness. Well, as we started to look everywhere else, it became obvious to us that this was true of all the cells in the body. The next place that we looked was of course the GI system, because we commonly use an expression "I have a gut feeling about" such and such. And so today we know that when you have that gut feeling, your gut cells secrete the same hormones that your brain does when it is going through an emotional experience. I would suggest that you can trust your gut feelings a little more, because your gut cells haven't yet evolved to the point where they doubt their own thinking. Today, we also know that about 75 to 80% of our heart cells are neuro cardiocytes. So when, um, the heart pumps blood, it also secretes hormones and peptides. And today if you say 'My heart is full of compassion', or love, or joy, or sadness, or hostility, or whatever, it is quite a different heart in each of these states of awareness. It is structurally different because it is chemically different and its structure is different. So this was a major breakthrough in the '70s. It took a long time for scientists in our field to recognize this, that the mind had escaped the confines of the brain. n fact, um, Candace used to say, uh, 'Your body is your subconscious mind,' that the body is the mind and that this is the battleground where we wage wars with our own self or we make peace with our own self. So that was what was going on in my life in the 1970s. And after I finished my residency and fellowship and started my practice, another thing became quite obvious to me and, obviously, to many other people who take a minute to reflect that you have two patients who get exactly the same treatment, they have the same illness, they may even see the same physician, and they may have completely different outcomes. So there was a lot of confusion, uh, in our minds as to why, given the same treatment, given the same physician, given the same disease, one could see such extreme variability in biological response, that we were pretending that the body was a machine, and yet it did not behave like a machine. And so I think the first thing that came to mind was that we had a model in medicine, and this model still exists, where consciousness is considered irrelevant and, uh, it's not interesting. Uh, consciousness, if it is acknowledged as an expression of our biology, then it starts to be -- and, again, Jean and I were having this conversation -- it starts to be -- you said -- who said that it's a secretion of the brain? 

00:21:05
UNKNOWN Hume. 

00:21:05
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA  Hume. The philosopher Hume said that, um, consciousness -- or likened consciousness to a secretion of the brain; just like your gallbladder secretes bile, your pancreas makes pancreatic juice, your stomach, uh, secretes hydrochloric acid, your brain secretes consciousness. And so if you have feelings or emotions or thoughts or memories or longings, or you fall in love or believe in God or heaven or hell or salvation or damnation, it's all the dance of molecules. Figure out how the molecules behave and then we'll have the answer to every question. Well, that model is falling apart. For those who are now looking at consciousness, consciousness definitely is the most challenging unsolved mystery in science. We have looked at the Big Bang, we have looked at biological evolution over 13.8 billion years of time, we have, uh, understood the laws of physics and chemistry and mathematics, but consciousness eludes us; it remains the big mystery, the hard question in science. But before I get there, I think one of the first things to recognize is that the model that we have of the human body in so-called "hard sciences", the biological sciences, is actually a model that is based on the superstition of materialism, because we look at the body as almost like a frozen anatomical structure. In fact, the first lesson that we learn in medical school as physicians -- the first thing we're taught is anatomy, so we think in anatomical terms, and we look at the body as an anatomical structure. And of course we know that our bodies are fluid and flowing processes. And I would like to suggest to you, and I'll get there in a little while, that these -- that our body's actually the most abstract thing you can think of; that the fact that we even experience it as physical is a perceptual artifact; that your body's not physical at all to begin with. It's like a flowing river. The Greek philosopher Heraclitus once said that you can look at a body as process, as a river, and you can never step into the same river twice. And that's true of your physical body. The physical body that you're using right now to listen to my lecture is not the physical body that you came in with a little while ago when you came into this room. And you can look at a number of processes, but even just the very simple act of breathing, with every breath that you breathe in, you breath in 10 to the power of 22 atoms from the physical universe. 10 to the power of 22 atoms is 10 followed by 22 zeros; an astronomical amount of stuff that comes into your body with every breath. With every breath that you breathe out, you breathe out 10 to the power of 22 atoms. So at the atomic level, you're literally breathing out bits and pieces of your heart and kidney and brain tissue. And technically speaking, we're all intimately sharing our organs with each other all the time. The great American poet Walt Whitman once said, "Every atom that belongs to you as well belongs to me." "Every atom that belongs to you as well belongs to me." And this is no longer a metaphor of poetry; this is a fact of biology. It takes very little mathematics, based on radioactive isotope turnover studies, to prove without a shadow of doubt that right now in this moment you have at least a million atoms that were once in the body of Jesus Christ, or Buddha, or Genghis Khan, or any other person you want to think of. In just the last three weeks, a quadrillion atoms, a quadrillion atoms, which is 10 followed by 15 zeros, have gone through your body, that have gone through the body of every other living species on this planet. So think of a tree in Africa, think of a squirrel in Siberia, think of a peasant in China, a taxi driver in Calcutta, a camel in Saudi Arabia, and you have stuff in your body that was there only three weeks ago. In less than one year, you replace 98% of all the atoms in your body. So at the atomic level, you're recycling your stomach lining every five days; your skin, once a month. Your skeleton, which seems so hard and solid, but it's a dynamic organ in life, with calcium and phosphorous, and the skeleton you have right now is not the one that you had three months ago. And even your DNA, which holds the memories of millions of years of evolutionary time, your DNA which holds the memories of millions of years of evolutionary time, the actual raw material that makes up your DNA, your chromosomes, which means the carbon, the hydrogen, the oxygen, the nitrogen, it comes and goes every six weeks, like migratory birds. I hope you know that 60% of your DNA's the same as a banana, that 80% of your DNA's the same as a mouse, that 98% of your DNA's the same as your -- as a monkey, as, uh, reading a book with this fellow from the New York Times who's getting a heart transplant and he goes into the history of the evolution of the human heart and he discovers that the actin and myosin fibers that make your heart beat, the DNA code for that, the genetic -- the genomic code for that, is the same that powers the wings of a butterfly or an insect. So there's amazing unity and memory across evolutionary time. And still the actual stuff of the DNA, it comes and goes every six weeks. So by the end of one year, you've replaced your entire body down to the last atom, which raises a very crucial question: Who are we? You know, this physical body that I'm using right now to manufacture this lecture is my year 2009 model. Last time I came here to Disney World -- Disneyland, I brought with me the same suitcase but not the same physical body, because the physical body is a process, it's a recycling of earth, air, water, and it comes and goes in the twinkling of an eye. The physical body that I brought with me here last time I came, as far as I'm concerned, personally concerned, it's dead, it's gone, it came from the dust, it recycled around what I call myself. It's now back in the dust and circulating in other life forms. So as far as I'm concerned, it's dead, it's gone. But since I haven't died in the meanwhile, I hope you'll agree that this is already scientific proof for the existence of life after death, because me as consciousness is constantly outliving the molecules through which I express myself. And this was one of the greatest -- the greatest insights of the great wisdom traditions in every culture, that there's a part of you that outlives the death of the molecules through which it expresses itself, that, um, there's an essence, the psyche if you will, the soul. Of course, modern science has huge problems with the psyche, with the soul. In the last century, when some people got interested in it, they would weigh a person just before they died, weigh them a little bit afterwards to see if something left. And since they couldn't find any difference in the weight, they at least came to one good scientific conclusion: If you have a soul, it probably doesn't weigh anything. In our own century, in the last century -- I'm sure you're familiar with the works of Wilder Penfield, uh, the great Canadian neuroscientist and neurosurgeon who was obsessed with finding the so-called homunculus in the brain or the body, the one that makes choices, the one has -- who has intention, the one who interprets, the one who has imagination or insight or intuition or creativity or choice-making. And Dr. Penfield was very frustrated because, all his look inside the brain, he could not find the person; you might say, the user of the brain. And finally he gave up and he said, 'If you have a soul, it probably doesn't exist inside your body. It may be there, because, you know, we are choice-makers and we remember and we have insight and imagination. It's difficult to conceive that this is an expression of the neural networks or the synaptic networks of our brain.' But we've gone beyond that now. That was almost 1950s, 75 years ago. Today we have the most sophisticated technologies that allow us to look into neurons and the connections between neurons. So let me ask you to right now imagine a couple of things. And you don't have to close your eyes to do this. I want you to imagine, um, that you're looking at a beautiful sunset over the ocean. Can you see a picture? I want you to imagine that you are looking at a golden flame of a beautiful candle in a dark room. Can you see that? I want you to imagine that you're looking at a beautiful red rose. Can you see it? Can you smell it? Can you feel the texture of the rose? Can you look at the green stem and run your fingers down the stem and feel the prickly thorns? And I'm sure you can have all of the experiences that I asked you to have right now. And imagine that I'm looking inside your brain when you're having any of these experiences, because today we can do that; you can take a carbon atom, you can radiolabel it, you can put it in a sugar molecule, you can inject it, and then you can track it as it moves across the brain. So you can track thoughts. And so I'm looking inside your brain while you're looking at a beautiful sunset in your imagination. Would I see pictures of sunsets in your neurons? Would I see your interneural connections broadcasting sound? What would I see? All I'd see is electrical firings between neurons, what are called synaptic networks, that basically shoot what I call action potentials, a digital code of photons that runs through a synaptic network. But you're not experiencing electrical firings across synaptic networks; you're seeing pictures and you're hearing sounds, and tasting and smelling and feeling textures. So where is that picture that you are seeing right now? Where is the picture of the sunset that you're seeing right now? Certainly it's not in your brain. Now, let's take this a little further. And, uh, look at this flag. And, uh, what color is this? 

00:34:50
UNKNOWN Red. 

00:34:50
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA Red. Is there a red beam of light coming from there to your eyes? Well, if there was, we'd see some red beams coming there. What we're seeing is a disturbance of electromagnetic energy, and that electromagnetic energy is colorless. It's electricity, basically. It stimulates your eyes, and an electrical current goes to your eyes, uh, from your eyes to your brain. And there's again the firing of synaptic networks. And you see red. Is the red in your brain? If I look inside your brain, would I see red pigment? I'll see electrical firings. So where's the red? Where is the red? 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN It's a translation -- a translation of the wavelength. 

00:35:45
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA  It's translation of the wavelength. 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN Into a different form of energy. 

00:35:50
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA  Into a different form of energy. Well, not quite, but almost. 

00:36:00
UNKNOWN I'm trying. 

00:36:00
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA The red is in your consciousness; it's not in your networks. Okay, the red is in your consciousness. Now, right now I'm speaking to you, and it seems like the sound is coming from here. Well, what's happening is I'm just vibrating my vocal cords, and the vibration of my vocal cords does not produce sound; it just vibrates. Okay, that produces vibration of the atmosphere, which is also soundless. That produces the vibration of your eardrums: soundless. That sends a current to your brain; the current does not have sound. And finally, in your brain there are electrical firings: no sound. So where's the sound? It's in your consciousness. Every color, every sound, every texture, every taste, every smell that you experience of the so-called external world is in your consciousness. Every thought that you have, everything that you imagine, every color and texture in your imagination is also in your consciousness. And this was the most brilliant insight of the great rishis of ancient India. They said, um, 'I'm not in the world; the world is in me. I'm not in the body; the body is in me. I'm not in the mind; the mind is in me. Curving back within myself, I create the mind, I create the body, and I create the whole universe,' that all that we call reality exists in our consciousness. Your body exists in your consciousness. So don't look for the soul in the body, because it's not there. If you want to look for the soul, you have to ask yourself first 'Am I in in the body, or is the body in me?' Your body's in your consciousness, your mind is in your consciousness, and everything that you call physical reality is in your consciousness. And today if you could look at the human body through the eyes of a physicist, you would see that your body's made up of atoms, the atoms are made up of subatomic particles that are moving at lightning speeds around huge empty spaces. And these subatomic particles are not material things; they are fluctuations of energy. They are fluctuations of light, actually. Right now, if you talk to the most radical scientists in the world, they'll say that the whole universe, including your body, including your brain, is basically the vibration of photons, that at the most fundamental level there's only one activity, and that is the vibration of photons, and that your physical body is what you experience as a physical thing out there or outside yourself, but in fact it's the experience of sound, sight, taste, smell, in consciousness. And when I asked you, for example, think of a sunset, as soon as you thought of a sunset on the ocean, you saw a picture and there was electrical firing in your networks. Did the electrical firing create the networks? Did the electrical firing create the picture? Did the picture create the electrical firing? Or did you create both? Did you simultaneously create both the electricity and the picture? So let me take you a little step further now. Where is Deepak? Where am I? I'm in your consciousness. What's here? Over here on this stage is a radically ambiguous and ceaselessly flowing quantum soup. Deepak is in your consciousness. This whole beautiful stadium is in your consciousness. There's a story about an Englishwoman who went to India to the emalia(ph). She met this great swami, and she said, 'Swami, gee, one day I want you to come to London. I want to bring you to London.' He said, 'Madame, I am London.' The whole universe is in your consciousness. And one of the big mysteries of science today, you know, when we look inside the body and look for your soul and can't find it, there's a simple explanation in science. The simplest explanation is the best explanation. It's called Occam's Principle. The reason you cannot be found in your body is that you're not in it. The body's in you. The mind is in you. The whole physical universe is in you. So where is this you? Because it remains illusive right now. So now I'm going to take you a little bit further into this journey, because there are friends of ours who are neuroscientists, who are also at the cutting edge, the frontiers of modern physics, friends that Jean and I know who are some of the most brilliant thinkers in the world. And what they are saying is that the essential nature of the physical world is that it's not physical; the essential nature of the physical world, of the material world, is that it's not material; the essential stuff of the universe is non-stuff. And we don't have to invoke esoteric Eastern mystical theology or metaphysics to understand this. This is the very basis of our science and technology. Today if I can surf the information highway on the Internet, if I can send you e-mail or text-message you or send a message or take a picture and send it to Twitter, that all these technologies are based on the fundamental premise in science that the material world is a projection, in consciousness -- or from consciousness, of impulses of energy and information that are vibrating at the speed of light; that if I could see the world as it really is, I would see a huge electromagnetic storm that's going on and off at the speed of light, 186,000 miles per second, or 300,000 kilometers per second. And the word that is in fashion these days to describe this vibratory energy of the universe is "discontinuity", because anything that goes on and off is a discontinuity, that the world appears to us in our consciousness as a continuity, but in fact it's energy and information that's going on and off at the speed of light. When you go to the movies, you see continuity on the screen, but if you go to the projection room you realize that a movie is a series of still frames that goes on and off. If I move the reel fast enough, then of course my sensory apparatus is not sharp enough to catch the off. And the memory of the on lingers in the off, so I see a motion picture. And if you've seen those old movies of Charlie Chaplin, they were jerky because the reel wasn't moving fast enough. Similarly, when you see a Christmas light going around a Christmas tree, there is no light actually traveling around the tree; only light bulbs are going on and off, and the motion of the moving light is in your consciousness. Or when you see a picture on your television screen, it moves from this side to this side. No picture travels from here to there; only electrons and photons go on and off in a certain pattern. The moving picture is in your consciousness. And like that, the whole world comes into existence in our consciousness as a result of this discontinuity, through some mysterious phenomenon. Photons bounce off your retina; they go on and off. Sounds -- or vibrations, not sounds, but vibrations of the atmosphere bounce on and off, that our whole experience of continuity's actually based on the discontinuity, and that includes sound, touch, sight, taste and smell. So if I put my hand on your thigh and I don't move it, after a while you won't know it's there. If I start to move it again, you might say 'What the heck are you trying to do?' So the discontinuity becomes the world in our consciousness. And today there's no argument about what's in the on of the vibration: It's energy and information. We use it in our technology, Twitter. The big mystery is not what's in the on but what's in the off, because between every two ons, there's an off. Between every two ons, there's an off. And here are some things that, today, science will not dispute about the discontinuity. I'll get to the part that's controversial, in a moment. But what I'm telling you right now is not controversial. The first thing that scientists agree upon as an expression of the discontinuity is that in the discontinuity there's no energy, there's no information, there's no space-time, and there are no objects. So if there's no energy, there's no information, there's no space-time, there are no objects, what's there? And the best answer that science can give us is there are infinite possibilities, that the discontinuity is a superposition of fields of infinite possibility, probability clouds that exist as pure potentiality. Space-time, energy, information and matter exist as potential. The second thing that all scientists agree about is that this discontinuity is a realm of nonlocal correlation, or infinite correlation, where all the activity of the universe is instantly correlated with all the activity of the universe. Interesting words. "Quantum entanglement" is another -- one word that scientists use. "Nonlocal correlation" is another word. Or you can -- they have other terms: "acausal non-local quantum mechanical interrelatedness". But the fact that everything is instantly correlated with everything else faster than the speed of light, this accounts for simultaneity in the physical universe and in biological organisms. The human body, for example, has 100 trillion cells, which is more than all the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. A human body has 100 trillion cells, which is more than all the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Each cell performs about 100,000 activities every second, and every cell instantly knows what all the other cells are doing, and correlates its activity with every other cell faster than the speed of light, instantly. How does a human body think thoughts, play a piano, kill germs, remove toxins and make a baby all at once? And while it's doing that, your body can track the movement of stars and planets, because your biological rhythms are the symphony of the whole universe, whether they are circadian rhythms or seasonal rhythms. But basically your body is the activity of the total universe. If we weren't using mathematical terms, we would say there is omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence, as a fundamental feature of the activity of your cells. So that's the second attribute of the discontinuity. The third attribute of the discontinuity is that it proliferates with uncertainty. The more we go deeper into the realm of the discontinuity, the more uncertain the laws of physics, of mathematics, become. We don't need to go into the history of the Heisenberg uncertainty, but you all know that when Heisenberg announced the Uncertainty Principle to Einstein, Einstein made the famous remark "God doesn't play dice with the universe." Well, Steven Hawking recently said 'God not only plays dice with the universe; God throws the dice where you will not find it.' That's the third principle. The fourth principle is quantum creativity, where patterns of energy and information suddenly re -- reconstruct themselves into new patterns of energy and information that have no -- do nothing with the previous patterns of energy and information. And if you track the latest thinking in evolutionary science, there are more and more scientists who are saying that evolution is not random mutations but is actually a phenomenon that is punctuated by quantum leaps of creativity or intentionality or creativity in general. True creativity means creating a new context, a new set of relationships, a new meaning, using the same information, and that evolution is punctuated by these leaps of creativity or intentionality. Which leads to the fifth quality of the discontinuity, which is observer effect, which was first, uh, very elegantly articulated by a great scientist called John Wheeler, who recently died only a year ago at the age of 97; one of the colleagues of Albert Einstein, who said that the physical universe does not exist unless there's a conscious being looking at it. So if there were no conscious beings, this would remain a vibration. And even that's a thought in consciousness anyway. So once again, the five attributes: pure potentiality; omnipresence, omnipotence, omniscience; infinite creativity; proliferation of uncertainty; and intentionality, observer effect. No controversy. The next bit which I'm going to say to you is controversial, because only a few scientists are saying this. But they are saying that the discontinuity is consciousness itself, that the whole universe is permeated by consciousness between every two ons, and the off is the intelligence that orchestrates the exquisite dance of creation. So right now as you're looking at me and you're listening to me, please try the following: Just turn your attention for just one second on the one who's listening. 

00:53:10
[sil.] 

00:53:10
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA So as you're listening to me, please be aware of the listener. 

00:53:20
[sil.] 

00:53:25
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA And if you feel a presence, that's your soul. It's not your mind, which might be saying 'I wish I'd gone to the bathroom before you started' or -- there's a core consciousness in which a thought comes, and then it returns there. There's a core consciousness from where feelings arise and they return there, from where the perceptions of the world arise and subside and return there. There's a core consciousness in which the molecules of your body appear to arise and subside, because once upon a time you had a body of a baby, a teenager, but this core consciousness was there. And the great wisdom traditions of the world have said hang onto this part of you, because it's the only part of you that's real; everything else is an impermanent dance in a consciousness that transcends space and time. Even space-time exists in your consciousness, not outside it. There's nothing outside of consciousness. The great Sufi poet Rumi: "I have lived on the lip of insanity, wanting to know reasons, knocking at the door. The door opens. I've been knocking from the inside!" There is no outside. There is only the inside. And there are no structures to the universe, there are no parts to the universe. That's all perceptual artifact. The universe is a constantly moving pattern. The physical body, the mind, everything, is a transient pattern that appears and disappears in this infinite consciousness. At the risk of being religious, I would say in the deeper reality there is only God, there is nothing else. And I think we are in a very interesting time in our lives right now, and this is a great conference, because the very name "Evolution" -- "The Evolution of Psychotherapy", that psychotherapy is ready to take on what materialist science and the superstition of materialism could never have understood, which is, the true meaning of healing. After all, the word "healing" comes from the word "holy". The word "healing", the word "holy", the word "wholeness", they're all the same word. Healing is the return of the memory of wholeness. And anything short of that is really injustice to the word "healing; that, as the words of Rumi, you are not just a drop in the ocean, you're the mighty ocean in the drop; and that as soon as we shift our attention to the transcendent aspect of ourselves, navigate in the realms of the transcendent, our biology will follow; that the future of our healing professions lies in the true understanding of the psyche, which is the soul; that everything else is a pattern of behavior of that deeper reality. Of course it has been hinted for the last 100 years in psychotherapy and the works of the great Carl Jung and many others who spoke about the collective unconscious and a deeper domain of archetypes, and memories and symbols, which is the real reality which projects itself as the more fundamental levels of perception.

DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA So I'd like to share with you some insights that, uh, I think would allow us to create a new model, a new model for biology, a new paradigm for understanding human biology or, in fact, biology itself, and that consciousness is not an epiphenomenon, but consciousness is the ground of existence that differentiates into everything that we call reality; that consciousness differentiates into space-time, energy, information and matter; that consciousness is nature's forces; it's behavior, it's emotions, it's moods, it's cognition, it's perception, it's personal transformations, it's, um, personal relationships, biological function, and social interactions; that these are not separate phenomena; they are differentiated aspects of a fundamental reality, they interdependently co-arise; and that it is -- for a truly holistic system to evolve, we have to understand that one has to really go to the most fundamental levels of being, because in our reductionist sciences we have tried to focus on one thing at a time, and as soon as we do that, we of course alter everything, because nothing exists by itself. A fundamental tenet of Buddhist philosophy as well: that there is no self-nature of objects, and the separate self does not exist. Right now we are sharing the same breath, what the Jews call "ruach Adonai"; the Muslims, "rooh"; the Greeks, "kenefma(ph)"; the Hindus, "Brahman"; that we are in one -- contained in one breath, we are members of one body, we are members of one energy field, one information field, and we are contained in a single consciousness. And in that consciousness, there are processes, no structures, no anatomy.

01:00:35
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA Okay, just for fun, I brought these slides, because what I wanted to show is -- how many people can see a skull there? And how many people can see a woman in front of her drawer? So what's on the screen? What's on the screen? 

01:00:55

01:00:55
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA Photons. 

01:01:00
UNKNOWN Oh! 

01:01:00
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA The picture is in your consciousness. And when -- when you look at one picture or the other, you're not doing anything to the picture on the screen. You're making a choice in consciousness, and that -- then you are recognizing your choice in consciousness of yourself as the picture on the screen. 

01:01:25
You are not doing anything to the picture on the screen. 

01:01:25
You are choosing and recognizing your choice in consciousness. 

01:01:25

01:01:40
You are choosing and recognizing your choice in consciousness. 

01:01:40
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA How many people can see a word there? "Liar". You know, there's a beautiful poem by William Blake; he says "We are led to believe a lie, When we see with and not through the eye, That was born in a night to perish in a night, While the soul slept in beams of light." Or Robert Frost: "We dance around the ring and suppose. The secret sits in the middle and knows." 

01:02:15
You are not doing anything to the picture on the screen. 

01:02:15
You are choosing and recognizing your choice in consciousness. 

01:02:15

01:03:45
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA And I think we could actually create something much more luminous, something that could be the healing of our planet, because what we call the world is a projection of our own self. Could we begin to see ourselves this way? Because it's a choice in consciousness, just like those pictures were choices in consciousness. And this is the great tradition of the yogis that they contributed to this beautiful knowledge when they said we have a physical body, we have an astral body, a light body, a subtle body, a causal body; that there were actually ways of looking at yourself as a being of light, there were ways of shifting your perception to a deeper aspect of your own being, so you saw yourself as you really are, not as a frozen anatomical sculpture fixed in space and time, but a dance of the universe, a universe that dances in beams of light. 

01:05:15
Soul of Healing: 

01:05:15
Six Postulates 

01:05:15
Postulate 1 

01:05:15
Healing is real and is biological 

01:05:15
orchestrated. 

01:05:15
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA So on the basis of this, I have put together a few postulates for healing. The first is that healing is real, it's biologically orchestrated, because biology is an expression of consciousness. And we are ready now to enter a new science that will proclaim us as healers and that actually those -- those of you, or all of you, who've dealt in the realms of the invisible will realize that that's where the real reality is. The abstract is re -- is concrete, and the concrete is abstract; that the action occurs in the deeper realm of consciousness. 

01:06:05
Soul of Healing: 

01:06:05
Six Postulates 

01:06:05
Postulate 2 

01:06:05
A naturally induced state of euphoria 

01:06:05
has biological consequences far 

01:06:05
beyond just feeling good. 

01:06:05
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA  The second slide: that a naturally induced state of euphoria has biological consequences that are beyond just feeling good; that ecstatic experiences, transcendent experiences, peak experiences, experiences of unity consciousness, alter our biological systems, because reality and biology and the state of the nervous system and our biological chemistry is different in different states of consciousness. In Vedic science, in the great wisdom tradition of Vedanta, beyond ordinary waking, dreaming and sleeping consciousness, is the fourth state of consciousness, called soul consciousness or transcendental consciousness. But beyond that, you know, there's -- again, quoting Walt Whitman, when he first glimpsed his soul, he says 'I must not be awake, for everything looks to me as it never did before, or else I'm awake for the first time, and all that was before was a mean sleep.' Waking up to the soul awakens a completely new different reality, a new biology. But beyond soul consciousness is cosmic consciousness, which is to be local and nonlocal at the same time, or which in Christian theology is called "to be in the world and not of it". And beyond that is a state called divine consciousness, where we begin to see the whole world both locally and nonlocally. What is this? It's a desk. It's a piece of furniture. But it's also wood, it's also a tree, it's also rainbows and sunshine and earth and water and wind and air and the ecosystem and the whole history of the universe, and the Big Bang pretending to be a piece of furniture. Go beyond that and there is God here. God consciousness opens a different reality. And beyond divine consciousness is unity consciousness, where the observer and the observed become one, and the whole universe is seen as an expression of that one-consciousness. 

01:08:40
Soul of Healing: 

01:08:40
Six Postulates 

01:08:40
Postulate 3 

01:08:40
Psychological information 

01:08:40
Emotional information 

01:08:40
Information through sensory input 

01:08:40
Information generated in consciousness 

01:08:40
Translate into biological information 

01:08:40
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA Psychological information, emotional information, information through sensory input, information generated in consciousness, all translates into biological information. There are techniques, as you know, in psychotherapy and in the great wisdom traditions that say, depending on the kind of information we feed into the body, we can translate that into a completely different expression of biology. 

01:09:10
Soul of Healing: 

01:09:10
Six Postulates 

01:09:10
Postulate 4 

01:09:10
Information transcends space and time. 

01:09:10
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA Information transcends space-time. Information exists as probability clouds in the field of pure potentiality till it is actualized. And this was, I think, the great insight of Carl Jung when he spoke that the collective unconsciousness and its archetypes exist as probability states till actualized, and yet govern everything that's happening in our ordinary lives. And today, science is discovering that your memories are not located in your brain, your memories are only actualized in your brain, your memories exist in the transcendent realm of possibility and probability; that you have access to memories that go beyond your own individuality. 

01:10:05
Soul of Healing: 

01:10:05
Six Postulates 

01:10:05
Postulate 5 

01:10:05
The healer's state of physical, 

01:10:05
emotional, and spiritual well-being 

01:10:05
influences and modulates the 

01:10:05
biological healing response of patient. 

01:10:05
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA The healer's state of physical, emotional and spiritual well-being influences and modulates the biological healing response of the patient, because there's no such thing as a separate self. We are part of a single emotional field. We resonate limbically, we resonate at the level of heart resonance, we resonate biologically; that if we want to be true healers, then we have to be healed ourselves. 

01:10:35
Soul of Healing: 

01:10:35
Six Postulates 

01:10:35
Postulate 6 - The soul exists! 

01:10:35
A field of intelligence (core 

01:10:35
consciousness) orchestrates 

01:10:35
biological activity through non- 

01:10:35
local, acausal, quantum mechanical 

01:10:35
interrelatedness - the synchronistic 

01:10:35
orchestration of space-time events. 

01:10:35
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA And finally, the sixth postulate: that the soul exists, that the soul is a core consciousness that transcends space-time, that is non-local, it orchestrates biological activity through nonlocal, acausal, quantum, mechanically interrelated happenings, or what is called interdependent co-arising.

Reinventing the Body 

01:11:00
5 Breakthroughs for 

01:11:00
the Body 

01:11:00
Your body is a process, not a structure. 

01:11:00
Your body is an energy and information field. 

01:11:00
Your genes are not deterministic (with 

01:11:00
exceptions). You can turn your genes on and 

01:11:00
off, and you can lengthen your telomeres, and 

01:11:00
you can change your brain structure. 

01:11:00
You can change your relationship with time. 

01:11:00
Awareness is the key to transformation and 

01:11:00
reinventing the body. 

01:11:00
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA Your body's a process, not a structure. Your body's an energy and information field, and we can learn to experience it as an energy and information field. Your genes are not deterministic, with the exception of mutated genes, like Huntington's chorea or cystic fibrosis. But if you're born with the normal 23,000-or-so genes, um, then you can down-regulate them and you can up-regulate them, depending on your state of consciousness. Amazing work recently published in the National Academy of Sciences, that looked at 500 genes that called for things like heart disease, inflammation, certain types of cancer, and also autoimmune diseases, type 2 diabetes. All these can be up-regulated, which means you turn off the bad genes and you turn on the good genes, just through work in consciousness - now, that's astounding - and that you can actually change the length of your telomeres by influencing, um, an enzyme called telomeres. So it used to be thought that telomeres are -- the length of telomeres is what creates biological determinism, that the -- that you have a genetic clock that influences when you will die, but even that can be influenced in consciousness; that you can rela -- change your relationship to time, because even time is created in consciousness. You know, we have an interesting civilization where the most frequently used phrase is "I'm running out of time." What does it mean to run out of time? This abstract thing called time that nobody has seen, and you're running out of it. And when you have that internal dialogue, your biological clock actually speeds up: you have a faster heart rate, you have high blood pressure, you have jittery platelets with high levels of adrenaline. And when such a person suddenly drops dead of a heart attack, then of course they've run out of time.

01:13:25
DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA Time is the -- the measurement of experience as a result of consciousness differentiating into an observer and observed. So if you're having a good time, then time flies. If you fall in love, then there is no time. And how we metabolize time actually influences our biological clock. So the great teachings of the great Rishi Vashishta, he says 'Time is the consumer, and we are its food.' But shift your attention from the time-bound to the timeless, and you then become the ruler of time as well, that awareness is the key to transformation and reinventing that physical body, and that there's a deeper level of core consciousness which great wisdom traditions have called the soul, and that when we get in touch with that, there is only choiceless awareness and subtle intention, which is what is, in the great traditions of the yogis, called karma yoga. Or the other forms of yoga - bhakti yoga, jnana(ph) yoga, raj yoga - all take you to a place of deeper awareness with subtle intention and then relinquishing the results to the unknown, that love is not a mere sentiment, a mere emotion; love is the ultimate truth at the heart of creation, and that it awakens the soul; that in that realm we have boundless imagination and creativity, we invite grace into our life because we feel the presence of divine intelligence wherever we go; that God is not difficult to find; God is impossible to avoid because there's nowhere that God is not; and finally, that we are in an interesting state of evolution where the human nervous system has become that privileged organ through which the universe is evolving to its next evolutionary stage, what my friend Jean Houston calls "jump time"; that this is jump time; that it is through these eyes and through this nervous system that we will begin to see ourselves as the instruments of the universe itself in its next phase of evolution. I have lots more slides, but I'm not going to go there today. I would like to end with a short story of my own granddaughter, whom I left this afternoon to come here to give this lecture. She's going to be seven very soon. And when she was about six and a few months, we were walking one day on the beach in La Jolla, under a canopy of stars and a beautiful full moon. And I was overwhelmed by feelings of love for her, and I turned to her and I said, 'Tara' -- her name is Tara, which means star. I said 'Tara, I love you very much.' And she said, um -- before I finished the sentence, she said, 'How much?' So I -- we were walking under the -- the canopy of stars. I said 'More than the stars, and more than the moon.' And before I finished the sentence, she said, 'Why?' And I said, 'Because you came from there.' And before I finished the sentence, she said, 'How did I come from there?' At this moment, I had the temptation to say 'Shut up and go and play with your toys,' but I thought I would explain photosynthesis to her. So I said, 'Tara, everything that you are comes from the light of the stars and the suns and the moons, because we are indeed beings of light, and all the energy that comes in the form of food that makes your body comes from there; even your eyes.' And I said, 'You know why the stars made eyes for you?' And the six-year old looks at me and she says, 'Why did the stars make eyes for me?' I said, 'The stars made eyes for you because they wanted to look at themselves.' And for the first time she actually shut up. But I could see that her wheels were spinning, because she was trying to come to grips with this thought that the stars made eyes for her because they wanted to look at themselves. And about five minutes later she tapped me on the knee and she said, 'Nana, look upstairs.' Not 'Look up.' 'Look upstairs. The stars want to see themselves.' And in that moment I felt that if a six-year old can remember, so can we. When I look at you, I am the eyes of the universe looking at myself, because you are the body of the universe, and these are the eyes of the universe. And that was the great ambition of the great seers of ancient wisdom traditions that said 'If you want to conquer your fear of death, if you want to cure suffering, if you want to really understand who you are, then do know that the separate self does not exist, that the separate self is a socially, culturally, religiously induced hallucination.' In the great wisdom tradition of Vedanta, they say there are five reasons that we suffer as human beings: the first is we do not know our true identity; the second is that we have cravings and addictions to things that are transient and passing patterns in our own consciousness; the third is we are afraid of change; the fourth is that we identify with this hallucination called the ego; and the fifth is the fear of death; that if we want to go beyond the suffering, then we have to go to the most basic fundamental question: Who am I? And we can answer that question if we take time, we stop, if we breathe, if we feel the world instead of trying to understand it, and if we ask ourselves very fundamental questions: Who am I? What's my purpose? How do I express myself? What does relationship mean to me? Who are my heroes and heroines in history, in mythology, archetypes? And how do I find my way into loving kindness, compassion, joy at the success of others, and equanimity? And that I do not have to know these answers but, if I live the questions, one day life will move me into the answers; and when it does, I'll be ready for it. Thank you very much.
