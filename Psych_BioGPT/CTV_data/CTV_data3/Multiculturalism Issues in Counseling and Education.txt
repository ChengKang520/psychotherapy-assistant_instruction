DON POPE-DAVIS It is important for me to understand the context in which I am relating to that individual which may not be exclusively race ah, or gender or what have you, the danger of only thinking in those terms is that that becomes the only vision or the only perspective of which I define the nature of my relationships with other people. 

00:00:30
Multiculturalism: 

00:00:30
DERALD WING SUE  Our biggest challenge probably is how do we begin to get groups working together, whether, grou, where groups begin to validate one another, understand, ah, one another and begin to value rather than tolerate the differences uhm, that are present. 

00:00:55
Issues in Education 

00:00:55
LUIS VAZQUEZ  We deal with issues such multiculturalism, ah, oppression, and racism and so forth. That is a very psychological, developmental emotional process, and I think the same is true as, as in developing self-awareness. I think if we fall down is for instance in areas of psychology and individual counseling. So, individually based and we don't have a systemic way to educate our students.

00:01:25
GERALD STONE  Welcome this afternoon to our forum of three distinguished panelists who are gonna be speaking to us about multicultural education and counseling, ah, and I think in order for us to give a introduction to the uhm, deliberations that we're going to have today, that I'd like each one of them to introduce themselves and talk a little bit about their interests and then we'll move on to some of the issues in the multicultural field. Ah, Don? 

00:02:00
Don Pope-Davis, Ph.D. University of Maryland 

00:02:00
DON POPE-DAVIS  My name is Don Pope-Davis. My area of interest in research is in multicultural counseling, specifically ah, issues of identity uhm, issues relating to cultural competence, uhm, and issues of assessment. 

00:02:20
Luis Vazquez, Ph.D. University of Iowa 

00:02:20
LUIS VAZQUEZ  My name is Luis Vazquez and uhm, and my interest are more ah, in multicultural counseling in human develo, in human development specifically looking at acculturation and bilingual skills of client and counselor, and how they use within that process and basically the "how to" of multicultural counseling. 

00:02:40
Derald Wing Sue, Ph.D. University of California-Hayward 

00:02:40
DERALD WING SUE  Ah, my name is Derald Wing Sue. Ah, my interests are primarily in education and training and recently, I've become much more ah, interested in what we call, ah, multicultural organizational development; that is, that ah, we're working more and more with uhm, how we get organizations and institutions to make changes as opposed to primarily ah, the individual. 

00:03:05
Gerald Stone, Ph.D. University of Iowa 

00:03:05
GERALD STONE And my name is ah, Gerry Stone and I'm a professor of Counseling Psychology at the University of Iowa and also the Director of the University Counseling Service, and I will try to facilitate this distinguished group. As a way to start, I, I wonder if you could help us understand this term " multicultural," and the way to do that for many of us in education and in the human service professions, we come from a long tradition of individual differences, both in terms of assessment and respecting individual differences in the classroom, in the consultation room and in psychotherapy. How would you help people that have this traditional orientation to individual differences? How would you help them understand how it is different from or enriches our concept of individual differences, and I wonder Derald if we could start with you. 

00:04:05
DERALD WING SUE Well, one of all the things that ah, that is important for us to, to understand is that, uhm, this to me indicates ah, the counseling and psychotherapy did, ah, originate from this concept of rugged individualism, individual differentiation and di, ah, differences and the ah, what we call the educational testing movement. I find that, that approach is uniquely Western European, ah, in its origin, ah, that there are many cultural groups uhm, that we're recognizing now in which the psychosocial unit of operation is not the individual. It resides either with the family, the group, or the collective society. Ah, and this is what ah, I feel multiculturalism adds the dimension to uhm, very few of us, uhm, in counseling and psychotherapy ah, think beyond the one-to-one, counselor-client, the I-Thou relationship." Ah, and I think that when you focus primarily upon just individuals, however, individual identity, you are negating a whole aspect of the human condition. Ah, one way that I like to frame it is that we actually have three levels of identity, uhm, what are called the individual level of identity, that is that you and I are uniquely different. We're unique, even my brother Stan who shares the same family background is different, ah, we're individuals in that respect. The second level uhm, that people talk about in counseling often times is what they call the universal level of identity; that we're all the same a, a, as well. Ah, the Shakespearean character who says "When I cut myself do I not bleed," (crosstalk) 

00:05:45
GERALD STONE Uh hmm. 

00:05:45
DERALD WING SUE uhm, indicates that we do have universal human qualities that we share. I thought, the third level, I find the most difficult for counselors to deal with uhm, which is a group level of identity and that is correlated with uhm, ah, ethnicity, race, culture, gender, uhm, a religious orientation. We, for some reason in our society, find it very difficult to recognize a group level of identity. Ah, I find people for example have difficulty looking at uhm, ah, Don and saying that "Gees, I see an African-American" or take knowledge the fact that you're black or that I'm an Asian. And frequently I'll hear people would say to me "Derald when I see you, I don't see you as an Asian. I see you as an individual." Uhm, they don't realize that they have negated a very important aspect of my identity and what I think multiculturalism is doing is trying to integrate this. Get all of us to begin to realize that there are different perspectives and different levels that we belonged to. 

00:06:45
GERALD STONE  That's very helpful. Luis or Don, do you wanna add to that? 

00:06:50
LUIS VAZQUEZ I would like to say that I, I also believe and not to add to this is the multiculturalism, if I were to conceptualize it, I would draw for the audience an umbrella of multiculturalism across the top. Under multiculturalism, we'd be looking at the Western world view, at the Central world view, Latinos, Asians, and so forth but not as one above another or in the pecking order if I were to say, but at an equal level or at least an integrative level because all cultures, because of the mixtures over the generations, we are intertwined and integrated at some levels, but it will be an umbrella spread instead of Western world view, ethnic race, gender, and then other. So, I would, for me I wou, I, I would have to see it as an... (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:07:40
LUIS VAZQUEZ ...umbrella of what multiculturalism with all the various factors underneath it. 

00:07:45
DON POPE-DAVIS I, I, I think too to, to follow along that same line, the notion of, ah, we, we also have the notion in, in education that we have in counseling ah, which Derald talked about of the individual. Uhm, uhm, I think when we talk about multicultural and see correctly stated I think, uhm, it is more than just one and, and that's a concept that I think we here in the United States have a very difficult time because we have, ah, we, we, we ha, we live in a culture, in a, in a, in a broader majority culture that values individuality ah, rugged individualism, ah, independence and, and, and, and when you think about those things uhm, ah, in the broadest scope of things, they may be validated ah, by particular segment of our society and when you meet an individual that does not value those kinds of things, ah, we are very quick in our society to, to diagnose this individual as being deficit in some particular areas. If we, however, adopt a multicultural perspective, we recognize that, that there are differences, that are simply different. Ah, uhm, there, there is very little need to put a value assessment on it and to say that you are different and therefore difference means negative. I think in a multicultural perspective, we recognize that, that people bring with them o, other kinds of things which make up who they are, and it is simply not a matter ah, uhm, of, of simply saying well I, I, I, I can work with you or some of us have heard people say, "I can work with anyone. Ah, I'm a counselor. I've been trained to work with anyone." Well that's not necessarily the case. 

00:09:35
GERALD STONE Right. Some authors in the field say that we take that multiculturalism concept to be so broadly defined, that I like what you said that difference sometimes is just difference. Some of the debate is about are there differences that have value-laden contributions to them because of past history such as oppression. And how do we make distinguished, distinct, distinctions between differences that are simply different and then differences because of context have a history to them that may add extra value to them. In other words, who's included with multicultural as a, as an authentic difference and of, when does that difference simply be different? Who would like to tackle this question because, because there is some debate... (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
DERALD WING SUE Uh-huh. 

00:10:35
GERALD STONE ...in, in the field of, of how broadly we spread that umbrella to include what differences. (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
DERALD WING SUE Yes, yes and it's, you know, I guess I would, would respond in this ah, manner. Ah, cross-cultural counseling or multicultural counseling ah, can be, if you look at it logically almost any type of counseling situation can be cross-cultural or multicultural in, in respect. But to, sometimes what happens, the fear among a lot of people is that when you broaden it so great it diffuses... (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:11:05
DERALD WING SUE ...the impact and importance of what's going on and some people have begun to ask why is it that uhm, ah, there are certain groups who are defining multiculturalism so broadly. Is it to avoid dealing with race uhm, ah, issues that they find very uncomfortable to deal with. Now, I have, the same thing with, is, is uhm, ah, multicultural i, involved in domestic multiculturalism or international multiculturalism and I guess I would answer that, that international multiculturalism has similarities to, to domestic ones. Uhm, The, the, the important point to point here is that there are a lot of people who prefer to deal with the international multiculturalism because it takes it away from their own ah, domestic working through of race-culture ah, issues, so that they find, that, that's pushing buttons in, in themselves uhm, but there are social-political factors that influence how we define, uhm, ah, how broadly or how narrowly uhm, you know, these terms cover. 

00:12:10
DON POPE-DAVIS  Ah, you know, ah, I, I've heard the same arguments we probably all have is that if you broaden this, you know, soon you can have a group of people that look a certain way and that's multicultural. And, and, and, and I'm not sure that I'm necessarily in favor of that. Uhm, uhm, however, I think, I think we have to be careful ah, not to define this in, in only in sociopolitical terms that may dictate how, how we respond when issues arise. Uhm, to define multiculturalism only in terms of race, by necessity, ah, ah, demands that, that, that, the, the world's view or the vision, or the perspective that I have is only seen as black and white ah, in this particular dyad. It may be seen as, (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:13:10
DON POPE-DAVIS but, but I think, I think there is a danger of, of not only, and when I see it in that way, there is a danger of seeing that is you versus me. And that's the part that, that doesn't make me completely comfortable when I only think of it in terms of the racial component. Yet, I know from experience, personal and professional experience, that race is an important, is an important aspect... (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:13:40
DON POPE-DAVIS ...of it. But also from experience, I know that I am more than just my race and, and, and that's an important dimension. I think, I think, ah, ah, I remember, uhm, uhm, I remember when I first started out in counseling, it wa, it was not uncommon for black clients to be referred to me because someone out there, the clinical coordinator would say "We've got a black client, let's send this person to Don." The assumption when a person does that in my mind is that they are assuming that race is the most salient ah, characteristic, and it ain't necessarily so. And so, you need to check out, check that out, and it may be gender, it may be religion, it may be other kinds of things maybe SES and so forth. That does not minimize the importance of race or gender in all of those things, but is important for me to understand the context in which I am relating to that individual which may not be exclusively race ah, or gender or what have you, the danger of only thinking in those terms is that, that becomes the only vision or the only perspective of which I define the nature of my relationships with other people. 

00:15:00
LUIS VAZQUEZ So I guess, (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
GERALD STONE Go ahead. 

00:15:00
LUIS VAZQUEZ I guess for me, uhm, when I hear the term "all inclusive" I wonder sometimes are we talking invisible and if "all inclusive" means to become invisible, then what is our responsibility and so for me when we talked about multiculturalism as being "all inclusive" with that if I, if I already talked about that I would take a step back and talk about my intentionality involved and my deliberateness as to what I mean by being "all inclusive" and if that does include becoming invisible and deluding my responsibility or better yet, me not having any responsibility at all for any or other groups or whatever, then I guess I would have to disagree, that I would have to focus more on what is the intentionality and what, and how do you plan to use this definition and not only working with others, training others but within myself? And what, and what privileges that allowing me to have with that intentionality? 

00:16:00
GERALD STONE It sounds like this is one of those dilemmas in which, of trying to balance the valuing of difference but yet not deluding it to such an extent that it becomes an invisible and that all differences are simply different but that how to maintain that balance of valuing the difference and not deluding it so we include all differences, ah, in terms of maintaining the balance. Ah, this might lead right into ah, for our educators and our counselors of these dilemmas of trying to maintain value and focus, leads us in how we communicate and educate our students, our clients and our patients who many of them are going through identity development... (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
LUIS VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:16:55
GERALD STONE ...themselves in trying to find out what pieces of this multidimensional, multicultural context they are going to identify with. There's a couple, there's a debate about how the best way to present this kind of information. One is kind of a focused approach where you have a multicultural course. 

00:17:15
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
Gerald Stone, Ph.D. 

00:17:15
GERALD STONE Another approach is what they call kind of an infusion model where all through the curriculum, culture, and gender, and race, and ethnicity are brought to bear on different in a wide range of courses. What have you found in terms of your experience and education and training in the business sector a more focused approach, a more infused approach, or a combination, what seems to work? 

00:17:40
Deralf Wing Sue, Ph.D. 

00:17:40
DERALD WING SUE  Uhm, first of all I would say that uhm, in the work that I've done with uhm, ah, business and industry, the whole focus originally of diversity training was on the workers, the work force, and ah, I would do in service uhm, ah, types of training with the, with the workers ah, with some of the middle managers. Ah, get a, some changes and understanding of, of uhm, ah, what multiculturalism and diversity was within the work force, but then I would find that there were areas in which these changes uhm, were blunted and a force made to begin to look at. For example, if we look at education, when we talk curriculum changes and how do we teach students uhm, I began to realize that that really may not be the area to focus in upon. The, the question and issue might be broader. How do we actually teach teachers to begin to change the way that they perceive ah, what education is all about? And then I asked myself the question, "Well, what, what makes teachers teach that way?" Ah, it's the policy's practices in way that for example the university operates from and then you have to begin to look at broader aspects of, of organizational development policies that, that are discriminatory and that ah, hurt uhm, ah, you know, movement ah, from occurring, and that is where I think that we make one of our basic mistakes. We think that we change the classroom, we add a class, we infuse in, in the curriculum, and there is no consequent changes and the faculty ah, structure, in promotion and tenure systems for ah, in recruitment uhm, ah, policies, and I began to realize that ah, "Look at, if we are to be truly multicultural and the university values multiculturalism, why isn't multiculturalism a criteria for recruitment, why isn't a criteria for promotion and tenure in the faculty, and ah, that's where I think we have to make basic changes, and I find universities uhm, ah, very rigid. They are more likely to make ah, ah, give students readings about multiculturalism and change something. But when you talk about these appraisal systems uhm, these systems for ah, how people relate to one another, it is almost, it's, it's uhm, it's a huge task. 

00:20:10
GERALD STONE How about in the ah, curriculum that you were both involved in, in preparing psychologists, and educators, and counselors in terms of there's probably more models... (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:20:20
GERALD STONE ...than a focused or an infused model? What seems to work best for you? 

00:20:25
Luis Vazquez, Ph.D. 

00:20:25
LUIS VAZQUEZ I would have to say a combination of both and but along with that I would have to preface that by saying that also I have yet to meet a colleague ah, regardless of what level and how many years they had been in the system that has grown up in such an environment that they are so culturally sensitive whether be to gender ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, and disability and since none of us have ever really grown up in such an environment, ah, I would have to say that it is difficult when we speak of these issues and yet not acknowledge that we were not trained or born in such environments, and then it has to become a collaborative process, not only with the diffusion within the classes or the int, integration in classes and also to one course but also among faculty members. Ah, when we walk down the halls, and we decide to discuss theories, whatsoever. I know that if I talk to certain colleagues, we'll have a common language and a common vocabulary, and, and we can also share those expe, those experiences within the classroom. On the other hand, ah, because of my training and ah, and which was a very good training, any of my colleagues could approach me and talk about just about any basic area whether it be... (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
LUIS VAZQUEZ ...psychology and counseling, and I can hold a very strong conversation and be able to talk about the different aspects and integrate these, and be able to conceptualize with my colleagues about these issues. But if I'm talking on multicultural issues, then the population that I have access to and may have the privilege to talk to is greatly reduced. So not only these are the infusion for the class, the single class, and the integration, but also my colleagues and how we as a whole embrace what multiculturalism is starting from the point of view that we were never born in such an environment or raised in such an environment and really our training is happening now, and we're still discovering what that all is, and just being able to admit that and how they get infused in, into the appraisal process for tenure and so forth, I think for me it would be the place to start, and I know that's a very long answer but I would have to look at those aspects. 

00:22:30
Don Pope-Davis 

00:22:30
DON POPE-DAVIS You know, Gerry, I, I think, I think for institutions from my experience that the notion of diversity and multiculturalism often gets confused. Uhm, ah, people say one when they mean the other ah, and so forth, and I think institutions, uhm, ah, for instance uhm, ah, uhm, I've heard people say, "We have a very multicultural ah, ah, ah, environment here because we have representation from various racial or ethnic groups and I like to chuckle about that, ah, because, e, and so, and people say, "Great! We've, we've done our job" and, and, and without taking a look at what other kinds of things ought to be done, to really think that through, uhm, because you may have diversified the environment. Uhm, ah, and to, to, to use them, to talk about them in very simple terms uhm, ah, uhm, is, you know, you, when you add people that look different than you in any way, (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:23:35
DON POPE-DAVIS shape, or form, you have diversified your environment. Ah, the next level e, e, in my mind it has to do with how do you bring diversity and multiculturalism into the infrastructure of the institutions and, and I think, ah, one way is to have courses that specifically address these issues and in fact, ah, I would probably argue that we have had those courses around for many years. (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
DERALD WING SUE Uh-huh. 

00:24:00
DON POPE-DAVIS They've, in most universities there had been, uhm, ah, uhm, I remember where, where I did my, ah, graduate work there was a Chicano studies program, there's a women studies program, there was an Asian studies program. I mean there were, there were opportunities to look at different cultures and so forth. Unfortunately, they were not part of the, the, the main infrastructure route that students e, and individuals took, took a part of. Uhm, ah, that's one level that I think needs to continue to be there so individuals want that systematic, more in-depth attention to multicultural issues then that opportunity is there. The other level has to do with, ah, faculties as we've begun to talk, educators, teachers who are teaching curriculum. Can you imagine going to a colleague and saying, "The way you have been teaching a particular course for the twen, last 20 years of your life, for the last 10 years of your life, I would like you to change that so it reflects not only the diversity but the multicultural components of our society." Most individuals will probably say, "What?" because. (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
 Hmm. 

00:25:10
DERALD WING SUE Academic freedom. 

00:25:10
DON POPE-DAVIS Right. Right. (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
 Yes. 

00:25:10
DON POPE-DAVIS  Precisely. Precisely. (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
 Our(ph). Yes. 

00:25:15
DON POPE-DAVIS Precisely. To, to, to add to that component, you have that area of, many of our instructors in our educational systems were trained at a time when these were not salient issues to be... (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
 Sure. 

00:25:25
DON POPE-DAVIS ...addressed or differences were to be minimized, and we were supposed to acculturate or some would say assimilate people into a mainstream model of doing things. 

00:25:35
 Hmm. 

00:25:35
DON POPE-DAVIS  And so what you have to do is to reeducate the educator, and I like Derald's model of, (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
DON POPE-DAVIS maybe we ought to stop or, and I wouldn't say " stop," but maybe in conjunction with presenting courses and programs that address these multicultural issues. We ought to also take a look at how can we train the trainers? (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
LUIS VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. Exactly. 

00:25:55
DON POPE-DAVIS  How can we train, how can we assist, provide an environment, reinforce, and I, I, and I think, I think I, I also like what, what Derald said about, about criterias. Uhm, uhm, I, I would like to see ah, an institution or programs say, "You know, ah, one of the criteria for evaluation is, is multicultural". How has this been demonstrated in your work, in your teaching, and so forth. (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:20
DON POPE-DAVIS  Uhm, ah, to have institutions take leadership roles and say, "We have a commitment to multiculturalism, therefore, everyone we hire must have a commitment to that orientation not in terms of a mandate but recognizing the reality of our society". Uhm, and I think we can begin to do those, is we, we haven't talked about how we do these... (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
 Yeah. 

00:26:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:45
DON POPE-DAVIS kinds of things yet but I think, I think that's part and parcel of the notion because by doing that, we, we move from this external, as Louise talked about, this external manifestation of, " Yes, we are a multicultural environment " and we say, "Here is how it is part of the info, institutional structures so that if the physical representation of this diversity disappears tomorrow, the institution can still bear witness to the fact that something that is permanently part of the institution will always remain. 

00:27:15
 Alright. 

00:27:15
GERALD STONE  Well, let's ah, I'd like to move us now down to some practical challenges here. I think we've established... (crosstalk) 

00:27:25
 Uh-huh. 

00:27:25
GERALD STONE ...ah, ah, a good beginning discovery of multiculturalism and how we might communicate that in the classroom and business. I'd like to give voice to some of the students who might be sitting in those classrooms or in that consultation room e, and see what you think about these challenges. Bring it down to a more concrete kinds of level. Uhm, some of our white students might say, "You know, I hear this presented and all I kinda do is feel like ah, I don't like to feel guilty that, you know, I can't get passed that and, and, and I just don't like feeling that way. It's hard for me to hear what you're telling me, 'coz I feel like I'm kind of the oppressor here and I feel guilty and why, why should I do that if I feel so badly about it?" Ah, our students of color say, "Well, that's my experience. I don't have anything to learn here. This is my experience. I come from this community, and I don't know why I need to do those readings or go through these curriculums or have these kinds of discussions. This is from my experience. So why do I need, wha, wha, what do I need to be trained to? I've lived it. I don't need training." How would you kind of address these issues that I think many of you have probably heard before? And, and, and how, how would you ah, d, deal with some of those student either voiced or unvoiced kinds of concerns? 

00:28:40
DERALD WING SUE You know the, let's, let's go to this issue of guilt. That, that is ah, a common response that I get from ah, people undergoing ah, multicultural training ah, in terms of talking about the fact that there, they feel guilty, defensive, angry, ah, as if we're accusing them of, of certain things. I think it, they have to get to the point of ah, asking themselves, "What does their whiteness mean to them?" ah, because when I talk about oppression and what has happened uhm, in, in society when I talk about ah, counseling and psychotherapy as, as practices that might ah, be cultural oppression. In some sense, they are inter, internalizing that ah, my whiteness has equated with all these oppressive acts that you're bringing ah, ah, you know, up at this point, and I ask him to say that, "Are you going to allow me to define your whiteness for you? But you, aren't you doing that to yourself? Are you defining yourself in, in this way that is making you guilty? If you, for example, have an Asian client who tells you that you're just a white, you know, you, how can you possibly understand? If you react defensively and ah, ridden with guilt, uhm, are you any help to that individual? So I really want the, the students to begin to ask them what does theit whiteness mean to them? Ah, guilt doesn't help and ah, frankly many racial ethnic minorities said they sensed guilt in, ah, the white student, the white administrator, the white colleague. They will manipulate and use that guilt to get their, ah, ah, their way. And I remember I, I have a good friend of mine. He's uhm, David Frye(ph), a white uhm, ah, counselor educator, graduated from ah, Purdue. I remember one time, he was sitting, uhm, years ago in what we call the education professions development act. It was a, ah, program funded specifically to train third world counselors, and he was the only white counselor educator on, in that whole group of, of African-Americans, Asians, ah, ah, Latinos, American, uhm, ah, Indian, ah, ah, professors and instructors, and there was a lot of hostility directed at him and like, if they would look at him and Dave is, you know, he's a pretty large guy so that we, the male white impact was clearer to what was going on here, and I remember that ah, one African-American faculty member would always make these comments directed to Dave, uhm, ah, attempting to, I think, elicit guilt and whether it was testing or not. I remember one time, ah, Dave looked at them directly and says, " I'm white. Let's deal with that." Ah there was no guilt. He was willing to lay his whiteness out there and deal with it and from then on, ah, his relationship with that faculty member just went forward. And I guess that what I'm asking is that, uhm, guilt hinders multicultural movement, and the trainer has to be aware of it and ha, have to use uhm, the understanding of that but the white individuals who are going to training eventually have to grappled with what their whiteness... (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:31:50
DERALD WING SUE ...means to them because they have a culture and ethnic background, and if they allow us to define what it is like what we've done in the past, then we won't move as a group. Race, culture, ethnicity is a function of all of us. It is not an Asian thing, an African-American thing, ah, a Latino thing, it's, it includes all of us, uhm, and white ethnics as well. 

00:32:10
 Right. 

00:32:10
GERALD STONE It sounds like guilt is an inadequate motivation... (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
DERALD WING SUE Yes. That's right. 

00:32:15
GERALD STONE ...for multicultural improvement. What, what about the students of color in terms of their feeling that they live it that they don't need the educational experiences? 

00:32:25
LUIS VAZQUEZ Well, well I guess for me, I would have to say that ah, well, I agree with the fact now on what Derald said about educating the educator here, because I think we, ah, as educated, educators of new students of color have to also realize that when you deal with issue such as multiculturalism, ah, oppression, and racism and so forth, that is a very psychological developmental emotional process and I think the same is true as, as in developing self awareness. I think when we fall down is for instance, in areas of psychology and individual counseling is so individually based that we don't have a systemic way to educate our students, such as in family uhm, counseling and rehabilitation counseling, uhm, where you have to deal with such things as genograms and so forth, to begin your own historical search, going back within your own generations, patterns of communications. If there hasn't been any types of relationships between new generations, of people of color and if you're student of color, have you had interactions with white outside of the classroom in the workplace, uhm, versus within your own family concept of, in, added intimate level? And what does all that mean? Being able to help students realize, uhm, ah, I know for one, from any students of color, the feeling is "I don't need this. I live this." But if we are to be counselors and I haven't lived where the white world student comes from. I haven't lived with the white suburban, maybe white has come from, and if I ain't to be a competent counselor and one to work with all these issues, ah, as Gerald had said, in order for me to be ethical, and do no harm, I must also know how I impact others, how that impact comes together, and with my experience with students of color, that once they understand, the power they hold, in being a counselor, and the privilege they hold with that position, along comes the responsibility and wanting to know more about themselve, and how that interaction takes place, but it's a very tricky process. 

00:34:35
GERALD STONE So I, I, I'm hearing from both of you, doc,(ph) I'll come back to you on that, is that you kind of challenged those reactions, both from the guilt and I've lived it, so there's really nothing that you have to, to, to o, to offer to me. Is that what I'm hearing from, from, from both, from both of you? (crosstalk) 

00:34:50
LUIS VAZQUEZ Definitely. 

00:34:50
DERALD WING SUE Definitely, but I think that it goes beyond this, uhm, uhm, you know, beyond just talking about, uhm, ah, you know, a white urban ah, phase. I think there is an issue of inter-ethnic understanding as well. (crosstalk) 

00:35:05
 Exactly. 

00:35:05
DERALD WING SUE  Ah, in the past, I think, that what we've done is like I was saying, ah, reacted towards racial ethnic minorities have banded together in terms of what we called the common enemy hypothesis, and is that, that ah, white society is seen as the oppressor and as a result, we needed numerically uhm, as a force to deal with this, so that our relationships with one another, and I'm talking about racial ethnic minorities, have been very superficial. We've been allies, but I have not understood, for example, ah, the deeper meaning of what it is to be a Latino, ah, what it is to be an African-American and I, I find that that's creating ah, a lot of misunderstanding now, because the, the demographics are changing. We're now getting to the point where, for example the year 2025, is it, uhm, a Hispanics will represent the largest group uhm, ah, in the United States, surpassing ah, African-Americans, and already were getting misunderstandings among Koreans and African-Americans. Uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:36:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:36:05
DERALD WING SUE  So that it's really important, if we are truly dealing with a diverse population, and if we are truly multicultural, it means that all of us have a lot of learning to do. I know Don and I. (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
Don Pope-Davis 

00:36:20
DON POPE-DAVIS And, I think, well, Derald has, has essentially said, what I, you know, I mean, that ah, what I was thinking too is that, is that the, the, ah, I like to call it the, the, the, the, the, the, the ah, ah, the, ah, student that says, " I have arrived. I don't need this." And so, and so one of the ways, e, e, e, one of the ways you deal with that is to talk about some other realities. He, he has, he has just mentioned, additionally too, when we, when a student says that, ah, particularly in terms of the, the thousands of people out there that are going to be in need of clinical. However, if, if I phrase this in terms of a clinical situation, uhm, and you say to that student, "Do you mean to tell me, that the only students you, and the only clients you intend, you're in private practice" is one of the examples I use, "This is your livelihood, and, and you have this particular orientation and say that you've arrived. You don't need to know how to work, work with anybody else. What implications does that have in terms of your livelihood?" Ah, ah, ah, ah, and people tend to, begin to think some of that through, because once you impact financial and other, other... (crosstalk) 

00:37:30
LUIS VAZQUEZ Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:37:30
DON POPE-DAVIS ...certain kinds of things, there's an attempt to say, " Well, well maybe there are some things I need to learn." Uhm, uhm, I, I think in some of the classes that I have taught where students have said that "I have challenged that". If a student had said to me, uhm, "I don't need this". My first response is usually, "Okay, before you drop this class, today, I would like you to demonstrate what this looks like. Show me. Show me. Uhm, I'll be you're client. Show me what multicultural counseling looks like." Even the experts have problems with, with... (crosstalk) 

00:38:05
 Uh-huh. 

00:38:05
DON POPE-DAVIS ...demonstrating that. So, so, so and, and I know that from, from what I've read and my experiences and so. I, I, I asked the student to provide me the opportunity. I am yet to find a student of color that has been able to do that. And that ah, ah, validation or invalidation makes the issue crystal clear, and recognize, and, and, and, and, and, and encourage the student to recognize that there is more to learn, just as education is developmental, becoming multiculturally competent is multicultural. It is an ongoing process, at the point in which any individual says, "I have arrived. Look out." 

00:38:40
 Alright. 

00:38:40
Gerald Stone, Ph.D. 

00:38:40
GERALD STONE  Well, I'm wondering, in, in terms, I mean, we've been speaking about the challenges that might come... (crosstalk) 

00:38:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:38:50
GERALD STONE ...from, from students. There are so many other challenges that we could talk about. I'm gonna list a few, and as I'm doing that, you may wanna think your in times, in terms of a way to summarize your, of what you think in the future, are some of the challenges that lie ahead, but some of the challenges we haven't had enough time to think about is the issue of the physical environment, and then, in, in which a business is lo, located, a school, a ah, community mental health center. How do they use the physical environment in such a way to show a valuing of cultural differences without and avoiding the problem of, of stereotyping... (crosstalk) 

00:39:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:39:25
GERALD STONE ...or objectification? So the whole physical environment is a challenge to infuse a multicultural environment. We could speak about the use of language, in education, in therapy. If language is learned, a, a different language is learned, when they're growing up, emotionality is attached to that particular language, and then we might force them in school, (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:39:50
GERALD STONE ...in therapy to use a different language and how much connection do they have in making the connection. So there are a lot of challenges. We've heard them, as I, as we tried to give some voice to students, but I'm wondering in, in the few remaining moments and we can kind of go and around here, what you see are the important challenges, for you as an educator, in terms of what it means to be multicultural, as, as we're approaching the ah, end of the century here? And we can start wherever, eh, eh everyone's pointing. This is a real challenge to see who's going to have the, the... (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
 Well, with violence(ph) have gone so long... (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
DERALD WING SUE - Uh-huh! But then he takes too long. 

00:40:30
 I, I, It's a... (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
GERALD STONE Yeah(ph) this will be brief challenges. 

00:40:35
 Brief challenges, right. 

00:40:35
 Then maybe you wanna start. 

00:40:35
Luis Vazquez, Ph.D. 

00:40:35
LUIS VAZQUEZ Well, let me be the brave one here. Uhm, ah, in my view, I strongly believe that there has to be ah, ah, a dismantling of how we train our students from kindergarten, and even within the home. I feel that uhm, as educators, we need to understand that when I get these students in my classes, and I'm sure others have experienced this, that there has been many years of learning how to think linearly. Linear thinking. How to categorize. How to compartmentalize. And then they enter my course. And so for me, dismantling that, that whole philosophy of what education is and how it relates to how we think, and not about others or anything, but just our linear thinking process. Along with that, is this whole notion of, and what I have coined in my classes is the ethnic barometer, the ethnic racial barometer. As far as when students come from such a linear thinking process, ah, we have to be very careful in looking at the total picture going into year 2000 or, or so, that, that, that, that thinking process has to be expanded, in more multidimensional, and also being able to look at what do I mean by ethnic barometer, and racial barometer. Let's get away from categorizing. Let's get away even amongst students of color as well as other. Let's walk out the ethnic barometer and see if you're Latino enough, if you're Asian enough, if you're multicultural enough, then get to the basics of dismantling that whole linear process and begin to deal with each other with respect and affirmation, and I think the challenges of educators like I said it should be, not to teach multicultural, multicultural at, at the university level, but begin at ethnic community level and I give you one brief example. I went to my son's preschool, and he has Asian-American, African-Americans and others. It's amazing. The only time they ever get, and may even speak many different languages. The only time that they get into conflict is when one wants the toy that another one has. Let us not deal with racial slurs and so forth. And they all played together. And it's amazing to see that happened, as with the few times that we start together, or either that, and as the commercial shows, or were in the cemetery. And so, for me, it's at whole linear and dismantling that whole philosophy of thinking. 

00:43:00
GERALD STONE Thank you, Luis. 

00:43:00
DON POPE-DAVIS  Ah, ah, I think that, that where we need to move to two concepts and, and, and it's a little about one is, we need to move to what I like to call cognitive diversity. That is a way of thinking. Uhm, uhm, now if your behavior is you might we need to modify the behavior first and, and, and so forth, but I and I think that's part of it too. But, we have to begin to challenge the way people think about things, and in this may relate to, to, to, ah, to Luis's ah, notion of linear way of thinking. Uhm, I think cognitive diversity is what, at, at, at which, which define for me means, means recognizing that there is a continuum in terms of how things are processed, how things are interpreted and so forth. It is not limited to only one way of, of thinking. It is a continuum. I think a multicultural orientation begs for a continuum, requires a continuum of which be, behavior becomes a relative concept, depending on who is defining it. Uhm, the other part of that for me has to do with uhm, ah, education. Uhm, I, I wholeheartedly agree that what we need to, where we, perhaps ought to begin to spend our energy is with our kids, uhm, so that when ah, ma, my son or my daughter reaches a, a college environment, uhm, uhm, the issue of diversity is no longer an issue that becomes explosive but it is taken for granted as germaine to the institution and so forth. I quite frankly don't hold much hope unfortunately for my colleagues who are faculty members today or people who run institutions. And I say that not to be negative, but more to recognize a realization that, that, that many of my colleagues who are out there have been away from educational learning for a long time. I think, most faculty administrators get in the mode of only teaching and minimizing the learning component, the "I have arrived"... (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
UH HMM.  

00:45:10
DON POPE-DAVIS ...notion, and therefore, there is not a lot that you have to try very hard. Now, that is not to say you cannot provide incentives for these individuals to, to change their curriculum, to change their way of thinking, but invariably, I find you continue to preach to the choir. And, and, and so, I think our efforts ought to be placed elsewhere. I like the idea that Derald mentioned earlier about teacher training, teachers who are gonna go out into the schools. That's where we, we introduced in these notions of multiculturalism, and diversity. Uhm, I think that's what we need, that's where need to begin to put some of our emphasis. If we don't, whether they like it or not, in the next century, they're gonna be dealt, they're gonna have to deal with the harsh reality. I think some business is beginning to, to change, not because they want to, but they recognize the reality. The world is becoming much more diverse, much more multicultural, and if they are going to have some kind of profit and impact that society, and have them buy their products, they have to become more, more multicultural in their orientation. Uhm, I think educators need educational institutions. Educators need to recognize that same kind of thing. If institutions do not change, they will become obsolete. 

00:46:25
GERALD STONE  Thanks, Don. 

00:46:30
DERALD WING SUE Can I say get over it? Let me just briefly, uhm, the, the question is real broad, and, and, you know, it, it's complex in terms of how we address it and, and ask it and all I can say is that, I, our biggest challenge probably is how do we begin to get groups working together. Whether, grou, where groups begin to validate one another, understand ah, one another, and begin to value rather than tolerate the differences uhm, that are present and I keep thinking about, in graduate school, the old Sharif(ph) study is about intergroup hostility, rivalry. Ah, I really believe that the answers lie there, that what he found was that ah, to get groups to stop the rivalry, the conflict, uhm, ah, the discrimination that went on, conditions had to exist, and those conditions are one, an equal-status relationship among the participants, ah, two, cooperation, and three, to achieve mutually shared goals. And ah, I still believe strongly that our society has to move in. Education has to move to that direction too, but the question then becomes, "How come if we these large uhm, answers, haven't we moved towards it?" And I think that it becomes clear to me the answer when you talk about an equal status relationship, I think the key is there. An equal power relationship an equal distribution of understanding, ah, that I feel does not exist and that's where I see our major focus needs to be ah, addressed now. 

00:48:10
GERALD STONE Well, I wanna thank each one of you for bringing thoughtful reflection to the area of multiculturalism in education and counseling and passion, and I invite you to this arena, to engage it, to value it, and the thoughtful reflection and the passion.
