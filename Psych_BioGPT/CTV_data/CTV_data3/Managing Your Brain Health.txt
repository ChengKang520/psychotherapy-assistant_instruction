MICHAEL MERZENICH Thank you Laurie. So umm… we're gonna focus on this, in this epoch on the, the reversible nature of plasticity. We're gonna talk about driving the rain forward or backward and what that's about. We're gonna, we're gonna talk about some implications of this brain's for healthy and unhealthy aging but really it applies to almost any condition, in which the uh… brain is challenge because the can… we've conducted an overlapping set of experiments in which we look at this is same issues from the uh… in early life. Looking at the distinction between a brain that has a really advantage early life from it, from a brain that has a really disadvantage early life, we'll talk about that too. And then we're gonna talk about uh… evolving strategies for managing brain health and specifically, uh… applying how we apply those strategies in patients with different clinical indications so we began investigating aspects of process that expressed plasticity and their reversible nature a long time ago. When we did the initial plasticity experiments, one of the things that we almost immediately appreciated was that it followed a Hebbian Rule, and that meant that if we had followed that rule we could drive brains in a improving or in a degrading direction. So and we did those experiments, historically, uh… circuit in the first uh… first years in the 1980s. So I can take a monkey in this case experiments, initial experiments were done on monkeys, and I could… I could very profoundly improve the way the monkey represented the detailed information that came from hearing or came from its surface of its hands or I could just as easily degrade it. And uh… and I'd… all I needed to do drive the things in a positive, negative direction was to, was to follow the rules that govern these changes that are occurring in the cir… in the function and circuits of the brain. And we became very interested more recently in studies that, that began about a decade ago, to try to look at this issue more, more completely and we asked the question, well, what is changing in the brain that's struggling or what is different from the brain that's struggling, that's seems to from a brain that doing well, and I would say that here, we're trying to extend these issues to a consideration not just a performance of humans but what you could call organic brain health, what is the status of a brain that doing really, really well? For example, a brain near the end of life versus the brain in the prime of life or a brain that's had a terrible early, early life struggles subject to abuse or neglect, severe neglect in early life versus a brain that's had a very healthy early life. How could… how… in, in, in what ways are these brains distinguished? And initially, working with Etenne de Villers-Sudani who's a wonderful scientist from uh… who is now at the Montreal Neurological Institute we see has this handsome guys picture here on the, on the left. Uh… we made a list of about 17 things, physical functional chemical things that we, we thought might index aspects of the brain that differ in the brain that doing well versus the brain struggling. We later expanded these studies by working with uh… at the NN, Jyoti Mishra who is a scientist at the University of California at San Francisco. Uh… and ultimately have got come to a list of about 26 or 27 things that we looked at in detail, an initially in animal brains and subsequently in human brains. Now in relation to that our, our first experiments were done in rats and the first model, we used was just simply to take a rat that was near the end of life, you can see this rat of the top here, is a nearly the end of life, you know, it's near the end of life because he's… he's uh… sort of hunkered down and he has white whiskers. So I like to say if you use a rat in your garage with white whiskers, be nice to him because he's old. So we're gonna look at this initially 17 but ultimately uh… approaching 30 things in the brain some physical, some functional, some chemical and we're gonna contrast them in their status with a brain that's in the prime of life uh… and then uh… the first question you might ask, I'm not without before I tell you what these many things are. First thing you might ask is, "Well how many of these things are actually different?" We're gonna look at that uh… large number of physical, functional, chemical things in the brain of an animal that's really thriving in the peak of their cognitive abilities and their performance abilities versus an animal that's not so far away from the end of life on this, on this planet. How many of these things are actually different? And the answer is all of them are different, very different, very substantially different, in an old versus young brain. Now we did this experiment in the second way by again uh… looking at the same set of things, in animals that have a terrible early life contrast with an animal that had a good early life, the same set of ultimately 26 or 27 things. And the same applies, every index, you could say a functional status is different, every one of them and an animal's had a difficult early life versus an animals that had a uh… healthy early life. Then the second question you might ask is how many of these things that are different advantage the struggling brain? And the answer is none of them. In every way, younger, if it's the case, we're comparing an animal, a prime of life versus the animal prime… end of life, younger is superior, younger is faster, it's more reliable, it's more intact physically, it's more intact chemically, younger it in every way is superior to older, by all of these indices. And then we ask really the, the critical question in this, in this study or studies, 'cause there's series of studies, critical question was "Well, how many of these things can be improved by engaging the animal in training?" And the answer that question is all of them. All of them can be improved, and in animals and humans most elemental faculties that we look at can be driven most of the way or all the way back to the status of a brain in the prime of life. I'm gonna repeat that in animals and even and humans, most of the things that embarrass the struggling brain can be driven all the way back or most of the way back, in the direction of an animal in the prime of life.

MICHAEL MERZENICH So here are some of the things we looked at. We looked at insulation of the brains of wires that's called myelin, and we're, we're interested in the formation of new Myelin and then the status of Myelin across time, myelination. Older brains or brains that are embarrassed or under myelinated, older brains because they are losing it, younger brains that are embarrassed because they aren't… they aren't making it in the normal rates of the normal way. Myelin is critical because uh… myelinated my limited brain is shipping information around it at, at high speed and that means that it's increasing the probability the activity arising at any level of the brain is going to be correlated. It's going to come to, to wherever it comes to in a brain in a coordinated way, coordination is a key to reliability and it's also a key to plasticity itself. Plasticity is time based and what it's the relying on is that information comes to any point in the brain from different sources that are required to master an ability nearly simultaneously in time, much easier to accomplish in the brain that is shipping information around at speed, than a brain that's very noisy and sluggish in operations. So speed is a critical dimension and speed uh… is effected by the, the state of insulation the brains wired. We see response power restored, some chemical and a whole series of ways that relate to the power of responses in brains. I will show you an example or two of that in a minute. We see local response coordination improved to useful strengths. We see the numbers of key neuron types restored for the very, very much weakened expressionist very poor. They've been morphologically altered from their status in a healthy animal but they haven't really grown up to the adult status in the case of the animal, the animal it's been embarrassed in early life and we see them restored to uh… to youthful strength, to uh… we see their neural connections re-elaborate. We see young brain chemistry supporting plasticity restored. We see the brain speeds up to restore youthful higher speed operations. We see the orderliness and the precision the representations of elemental inputs when eyes, ears and skin restored. And on and on, all everything we look at is restored. But here's a few simple examples and I don't know how clear these are to you in the, in the lumination. Uh… this is myelination and what we're looking at here is the crypt formation of new Myelin and once you train an animal, you can actually look if you trained it in a mode. Let's say listening, you can see the whole listening machinery the brain lighted… lighted up you could say by nee Myelin formation. Actually you see dramatic changes that are occurring at every level and you also see new Myelin in the hippocampus, new Myelin in the basal ganglia, all kinds of places that are if, that are if, that are receiving inputs from this… from the system that you've engaged in training. I'm going to tell you a little bit later about what training is required to do this, okay? Relatively simple forms. So on the… if you look in the right, you can see that in a young animal, there's quite a bit of Myelin being made by the brain in the, in the old animal almost none. In the in the old trained animal you see a lot of myelin being made again and if you just control the dosing, New myelin information in the old animal can be equ… equivalent to that of an animal in the, in the prime of life. And if you just control the dosing, you can take an animal that's been embarrassed at early life and you can generate new myelin information that's just as active and beautiful, as an animal that's had a good life to that point in life. This is response correlation, and response correlation is critical locally on the cortex because it's really reflecting the degree of cooperativity or it's… you could think of it as a teamwork measure. The greater the teamwork the more reliable, the responding, the signaling in the brain and on the bottom where you could see this little, these thoughts in red that's the uh… that's the old guy. The train guy is actually uh… uh… the young… young is in the middle. The train coordination actually leapfrogs. The old trainer animal actually leapfrogs the animal supposed to die in another month or so. The coordination that's driven by training actually leapfrogs coordination that seen in the young guy and you can train the young animal in the prime of life and it again leapfrogs the ability of the old trained animal. We see things like this over and over again as you don't have time to go through all these details from the simple experiments on animals. This is post excitatory inhibition and this is a critical aspect of local responding that controls how rapidly the brain can respond to represent the details of what's happening across time. So basically every time there's an excited to an event the brain is taking a sample and that it's suppressing activity and it's sort of resetting its processes for the next event. And it's important to be young that it be powerful to resolve the details of what's happening in any sort of serial or complex action. You can see that it's relatively strong in a young animal in the upper left, relatively, weak in the old animal at the lower left recovered, in the in the trained animal at the lower right. In fact you have to train the young animal, that's in the upper right in order to again leapfrog the changes that you see in the old trained animal. So it's completely restored by training. Here's a population of inhibitory neurons that's really critical in the operations of a brain that's controlling operations across the system. Parvalbumin inhibitory neurons are actually controlling the degree of coordination and activity that, that supports system coordination. So it really, it's going to reflect how strongly the system can sustain its connections level by level and the… in operations. You can see those relatively few of these neurons that are active in the, in the young animal. In the old animal versus the young and you can see the restoration in the old trained animal and, and if you control the dosing, you can easily match the, the magnificence of these neurons and… and their morphologies that you see in the young animal by training the old animal. So you can completely restore it. Now, this is another example, I'm using this example to try to explain to you that these changes are not about connect connectivity, they're just not… just about connectivity. So here we're looking at something that's removed, or how you normally think about plasticity. Now, here's the index of the integrity of what's called the blood brain barrier. The blood brain, the blood… the brain has a special strategy to separate the blood compartment from the brain compartment. And it does this for two reasons, the first reason is that, that the, the, the ionic consistency of blood is incompatible with the conditions that are required to control electrical activity in brain tissues. So if there's a link between the blood… compartment and the brain compartment, it contri… it adds to meaningless noise in the brain compartment. Just generates lots of useless activity that degrades operations and brains. The blood brain barrier is poorly developed in children that have a very difficult early life and it's compromised progress away as we grow older. It's important that, that we keep it intact, just for these electrical reasons that relate to the powers of operation of the brain. But more than that, the open barrier allows the transmission of infectious agents from blood into brain. So actually this is a strategy the brain has to protect itself from infectious agents moving from, from the blood compartment into brain compartment. And in fact, one of the dominant notions about origins of Alzheimer's disease, for example, is that infections agents move… moving from blood to brain, move into brain tissue where the brain responds to them by coating them with, with a poly… polypeptide called amyloid and that's the formation of… base of the formation of what we call an amyloid body which is a signature deficit in Alzheimer's disease and occurs because of break barriers leaky. Well, you can… you can see the barrier intact here that the barrier is indicated, this is… apparently it's done by Etenna de villers-satani and the leakiness is reflected by the fact that in the old brain, there's lots of the diffusion of this, this uh… this is colored agent from the blood compartment into the surrounding brain tissue. And yet that's the fusion of, of color, green color out into the, into the flesh of the brain. And then you can see in the old train animal, it's resealed and in fact a closure is, can because perfect. We've done this experiment a whole variety of ways. In fact, we can open and close the blood brain barrier at will, by training an animal. When we drag negative plasticity, we can open it broadly. When we drive plasticity in second direction, we, we recover its resilience. That's something, that's some critical dimension that's not strictly neurological because we know that this is accounted for, by actually drive changes, not in neurons at all but in so-called glial cells. A picture of class of glial cells called Astroglia, who have processes that line the surfaces of blood vessels to support the integrity of the, the management integrity of this barrier. Those same processes are actually also control what's called a reactive hyperemia, and that's a blood flow that occurs locally in the brain, it's a function of the activity in that little region of the brain. Signature deficit again, that occurs in an aging brain. It's a loss of control of reactive hyperemia. The brain basically does not get blood and, and nutrients you could say in an adequate way, as a simple function of how active the region the tissues underneath it are. Simply no longer house that basis of control, it's degraded, it's degraded because the changes have occurred, negatively, plastic… plastically in this non-neuron population in these glial cells called Astroglia. All of that is plastic and all of that is reversible. So how do you turn an older impaired brain into a physical and functioning more capable or younger one? We will training it. Of course, it matters how you train it. So let's, let's, let's just talk a little bit about how we trained it? That takes two different dimensions of training and this is a little bit complicated because I'm gonna talk about things in a little bit of a simplistic way. But the first thing, you have to do is you have to reestablish the resolving power of the brain in detail in, in, in, in time and in place. You have to really establish the resolving power. So the brain basically has you could think of it as a recovery of brain speed and recovery of brain processing accuracy. So when brains are deteriorating and aging they are inaccurate in their processes and speed, they're no longer operating at speed. They're sluggish and their operations are no longer resolving the, the details of the information as it flows by high speed and they no longer representing information with accuracy, accuracy or reliability. And you have to train in a way that recovers that. Now in relation to that, that's very different of how about, how you would think about, you would train a brain to recover it when you think about cognitive training. Because where as, you're thinking about generally sort of higher level skills or abilities that apply to your more sophisticated cognitive operations, okay, it's more elemental than that. If the brain is not resolving information accurately in detail, and in a fast time, everything comes from that. When you have a… you have the bottom, the most elemental process of the machine embarrassed, in this way only thing you can get from it is crap. Right, all cognitive operations are dependent upon the brain resolving information with high accuracy at high speed. And in fact if you look at something some higher order measure, let's say like a measure of fluid intelligence, what accounts for it, in terms of brain operations? Well half of the variance, in food intelligence and measure of food intelligence relates to the processing speed of the brain. So one of the things you have to recover is processing speed. Now the second thing you have to do is you have to restore the accuracy with which the brain is controlling information from the top and from the top, I mean, the brain has holes with information and working memory or you could say, it's continually reading the past event and it's continually making predictions about what should happen next. And it's using this information what we call working memory which is the same as… working memory is the same as forward prediction. It's the same as associative memory really. The brain has this capacity to hold information in place for periods of up to a couple minutes in time. While it uses of the as a model for whatever it's making a decision about to change itself. So in specific terms, you have to train the brain to keep track of something and to not lose track of it, in the face of throwing lots of rocks at it that is to say in the face of distracters, when the face of noise in the environment that's, that's trying to carry you off the beam. So you have to re-strengthen these processes in which you can hold information and working memory almost, no matter what. And uh… and we do this basically by training the animal or human to hold information in a continuous performance task, in, in place, you could say while we… while distracters initially very remote from it are occurring in a rich form but ultimately, it come very confused to it. So you could say, you're trying to improve the resolving power of the brain as it's operating from the top. Resolving power from the bottom, resolving power from the top. And when you do these two things together all of these things are restored to normalcy. I might say or dramatically improved. I might say that we were really surprised by this. We didn't expect everything to change, be changed. We didn't expect all of this these changes to be coordinated. All of them to work together. So we can have a simple task that has both of these elements within it, actually we commonly apply this training in multiple tasks that have different forms but, there are forms of tasking in which we can combine all of this critical aspects of it into the… in a mug like vision or hearing or some of thesis. And we see all of these things change together. So this raises the question about why the brain goes to health to start with? Why does an old brain lose its way? What's the source of this negative plasticity? Uh… so we did experiments in which we asked the question, well, how could we accelerate aging? How can we drive the brain, turn the brain that's in the prime of life into an old one? Now because plasticity appears to be reversible if we have a brain in the prime of life and we drive it in this deteriorating direction, being old, in the functionality of brain is equivalent to being very young. Okay, so this is a sort of another second surprising thing that we saw, not surprising so much when we review the literature if you look at the characteristics of the brain, near the end of life, operationally in this, in this 25 uh… index way, the brain of an animal near the end of life looks like the brain of an animal it's had no experience. So you come out of the noise and you organize your activities in a brain get some so high point in which operating at high speed with high accuracy and high fidelity you could say, and then it slowly slides back in the direction that it came from, because the processes that are involved in it, in it, in it are by their nature reversible. And one thing that illustrates this was, was how easy it was to turn the brain in the prime of life into an old one. And all you have to do to do that is to just add noise. Noise, I mean, we're adding noise to through the process of the brain itself but actually one of the ways we achieve this, was to put animals in the continuous presence of acoustic noise. Where everything they animal heard in the listening domain of the, of the brain with the noise was just on a level below the level that would damage hearing itself, okay, so every… everything we… every… all the inputs into the brain from the acoustic domain would be frustrated. The animal could receive basically no correlated information. So the another way of shutting down, the brain system but also the system is being pounded with noise but on, on… meaningless, unregulated activity. When you do that for a period of three or four or five weeks the animal looks like, it's about to die and its brain looks like the brain of an animal at the end of life. Not just one last point about these experiments. When we took an animal that's was a month or two away from the time in which they expected to die and we trained it for a period of four to six weeks. This is not nothing… training it's not nothing it's pretty, pretty heavy duty for an animal. The animal was about to die. They were very lively. They were full of it. They tried to bite us again, they're very active. Clearly, much more engaged so de Villers-Satani asked a simple question, well, how long will these animals live if there's no more training? So at this point, he kept animals alive and the life is extended by 40%. They had been rejuvenated physically in their body health by intensively training their brain and he's been studying this ever since. The problem was studying it is that you have animals… he has animals in his study that refused to die because he chose to study it by trying to see how long you could keep an animal alive by training it. So you're going to hear about this before too long and it's going to be exciting in the wider world but you could do some… we don't really think about the integrity of our, our, our brain health driven by engaging ourselves physically, think of all of these positive things that come from the body that possibly impact our brain, there's a massive interest in this, and it's important to interest, it's valid. But we think far less about an equally powerful, it maybe even more powerful set of influences on the health of our body that come from the status of the organic health of our brain. It's also a major impact on what's happening in our physical body, I mean, I mean, brain… brain to body word. So we peer to have the power to throw the plasticity switch it will, you could say. So we had animals that are not so far away from leaving this mortal coil and we did something we intervene relatively simple ways and all of these changes that were going negative, move positive or the animal that was doing well and we threw the switch in the opposite direction and we accelerated the changes in a negative order… direction. So in a sense, there's a… you can think of there's a sort of master switch and if you do the right thing, all other things will move forward or all of things will move backward 'cause to some extent we understand how to control that switch. You can think of changes in a positive direction as being in a blastic or growth or, or, or brain health supportive direction and in the opposite direction in a clastic or degeneration of brain health, degraded direction. So what's the source of all that noise that arises… right. So think about this guy sitting in the orchestra and he's learned to master the stool, incredibly complicated tool use, he's a master controlling his, this the hand and the fingering hand master controlling and expressing his emotions or the movements of bow hand. He's a master listener. He's, he's, he's a master at interpreting the queuing that's coming from the conductor in the language of the conductor to the musician. This is incredibly complicated business and in order for him to perform at the highest level he needs to practice. He needs to practice in sustaining all of the details of his operations at speed and in detail, by continuous practice. Now what if, what if fellow here stopped practicing? What if he didn't practice for a month? Well everyone around him would know it. Most professional musicians practice a significant period of time every day, hours every day. So even from a month of no practice, a little flipping would be detectable by the other professionals around him. What if he didn't practice for a year? Well, he probably would have lose, lost his position in the orchestra. And uh… and if not he'd be in danger of losing it anytime. What if he didn't practice for 10 years? Well, he'd be uh… there would be fun at parties. He could still play as violin and make us cry, but no one would… but no one really would except his uh… that he sustain himself as a hired professional, expert on his on a stool. What a builder cited after not playing for 10 years? That he'd go back in their period of intense practice and try to reestablish his, his life as a professional musician, would he have a chance? We know that he would, in fact, we know that there are many professional musicians that have taken long hiatus is for whatever reason, and have come back and performed at a level just as high as ever or higher. So you probably haven't been practicing enough. But what is practiced mean? While when you're a kid, you're heavily engaged in operating on the basis of your interpretation of the details of the physical environment of functional social environment you're operating in and then you, and you learn all of these skills that autotomize. And more and more as we come to the center of life, we're, we're, we're operating on automatic pilot most of the skills and abilities that we've learned. We've learned in the historic past and we're not spending much time sustaining them as refined skills in a high level. It's because in that common life, I submit that this impart is a function of the fact that we were evolved to live in a continuously, in challenging environmental circumstances. And as we evolve culturally, we got past that. And we develop a sort of cultural life, life form well first of all, we weren't meant to last as long as we were last, very much for the somebody that do us ended, long before but now that we're long lived and now that we've adopted our, our the traditional way we have this period of time in which we're learning about things, in this period of time in which we begin to do things in this part of time in which we do things with high reliability. We've evolved in ways that are not to the advantage of our brain from the point of view of the staging, reducing chatter in our brains and sustaining highly coordinated organize local activities. And their many other source of the growing noise, rising from our modern cultural environments. So here's a guy doing what the average American does about 11 hours a day. Can you believe it, sitting on your butt? You sit on your butt, you have this uh… you have a little, you know, this little your arms are out here like little appendages, like little robot arm doing various things but primarily you're not really very much into the business of translating what's happening in the world into any kind of action except. In as translated on that in the screen in front of you and look terms of those little actions and then equally astoundingly, we spent an amazing amount of time every day looking at a screen. And again this is not really an occasion or really uh… you could say life in which anything really matters to us very much. We're not really very strongly into a learning mode to a large extent, we're responding emotionally but almost no other way. Okay, this is another way of being offline for long periods of time not practicing you could say. Of course, we don't actually have to know anything. You don't actually have to exercise our powers of reason. Because we can always look up the answer and I'd say there's great virtue in doing that that's a fabulous resource that we have to be able to look up the answers to things or get information about things for a period of time, what a wonderful thing. But you do that at a cost and every child does that at a cost, except the which they're not engaging their brain to solve its problems or to solve the problems that they face in life and that's gonna be dramatically change, how the basic human operates in the world. It is changing rapidly, in the not too distant future. We've decided to pave the damn world so that we can move across that without thinking about it. So even we're out of the country, you know, a beautiful place we've got to… we have to walk on a pave surface and that's another way of saying that we are actually designed to deal with and massively exercised by dealing with a world in which every footfall was uncertain. In the world, it was full of surprises that mattered to us, mattered to us to understand or interpret, whether they had meaning to us and we tried to remove all of that from us. So that we can engage our self in higher brain activities and operations. What a bunch of nonsense because we don't actually have to know where we are or how to get there, one of the most powerful assets that we have in our brains. As asset that tells us uh… that helps us reconstruct the environment that we operate in. This is one of the main things our brain was constructed to do to make us masters of the physical environment in which we live. And uh… an increasingly we get away from that, increasingly people are depriving themselves, you could say. Neglecting the practice that they need to sustain higher ability, in that respect and even when something amazing happens right in front of us uh… We…we, we, we, we're less likely decade by decade to respond to it. Because we're so inward thinking in our, in our minds and in ourselves. We're so out of it. So I've been taking a walk in my neighborhood in San Francisco, I live in a beautiful neighborhood and it's a sort of in the center of the city of San Francisco and I walk for about 35-40 minutes every day with my dog. I've done this for since I first came there in uh… 50 some years ago. And across that period of time that I've been, that I've been doing that there's been a dramatic change in the way I interact with the citizens that I meet on the path, on my walk. Historically, 230 years ago, most people that you met on the street would, we would acknowledge the fact that you exist and another human being is walking by you, maybe I should somehow acknowledge that and they would look at you and commonly smile or maybe say a little thing or two, or two that indicates that they're actually acknowledge to you as a fellow human being and that you're actually exist. Now most people are in a shell. And they're very much within themselves and they're, they're probably within their thoughts commonly, not uncommonly they're on their device. So they're in a shell with their device. And uh… and they're just disconnected from the world. They're no longer feeling it. They're no longer smelling it. They're no longer really seeing it. They're… they're as a distracted human being basically operating you can say as if, operating itself they really don't need that rather troublesome requirement of having much of a brain. So we're, we're evolving in ways that are actually destructive, in my view. Wonderful in a lot of ways from the point of view of our powers of operations on the planet, but destructive from the my view in, in the way that our activities actually support our brain health and lots of ways where our lifestyles are contributing to the, to the injection of noisy, noisiness into the processes of our brains. What's normal about this? Not really very much. So umm… there are also hundreds of other vicissitudes that increase brain noise, so I don't know how… probably most of you're not into the literature that relates to the, the humpty-hump things that increase the probability that you'll develop dementia at a younger age. But the list is long, so list is probably greater than 200 and I just listed 50 things here. I couldn't, you know, you could these are somewhat arbitrary. So this all chronic high blood pressure, alcoholism, multiple sclerosis, hypothyroidism, you go on and on, all of these zillion things. Now if you live life without having one of these things happen to you. It's a miracle. Abnormal is normal. It's just that's just the fact that. All of us have a vicissitudes in life and those what's common about these is you can translate almost every one of these in a relatively simple way into a source of brain noise it's the increase of the noisiness of the brain that ultimately, basically contributes to our brain getting into trouble and in generating the condition we called Alzheimer's disease. So umm… before I talk about Alzheimer's Disease I just wanna say well what on earth is the negative side of plus this they all about why did Mother Nature or the creator of the universe do this to us what is this about? Well, our reversible plasticity assures that we sustain over all neural behavior control. It's all about getting the answer right. So we evolve like every other creature on the planet under the, under the drive of conditions of survival meeting conditions of viable means that we have to get the answer right. We have to basically make a correct interpretation what's happening out there or the things that constitute things that would contribute to our thriving or device. So we have to get the answer right. Getting answer right is the key to historic human survival, not so much now but in the old days it was. If we're consistently correct our machine advances its powers. Because it's actually controlling plasticity on the basis of a basic a performance. When it gets the answer right, it enables positive change. Long as you consistently get the answer right, under the right conditions, critical say under the right conditions the machinery will advance. That's the way, it's constructed. And when are you gonna make errors. It adjusts to take longer, just this machinery so that it's more likely to get the answer right. When you make errors basically it relaxes those conditions it takes longer, it has a longer dwell time you could say before it decides what's just happened. It has to do this it has to basically relax how broadly it looks at the details of things too. So basically adjust its accuracy and adjust its time constants, so that is taking a broader look to make sure that it understands what it's just saying. You can think of it as I'm looking out across the meadow in the evening near dusk and I see something at the edge of the woods, I say, what is that? Well, you have to take longer than you would in the bright sunlight to say that's a deer, right? So to the brain has to take longer, it has to look in a different way to resolve to make sure that it's got an answer right. Older individual sustain basic control of their operations and they think everything is fine, everything's under control, even while our brain is usually slowly using its useful high speed, high accuracy prowess. So one of the problems with us is that, it's susceptive, the same to in a young child that struggles. We see the young child and struggle when we say, well, you know, Mary's doing fine. She seems under control now and everything but her brain maybe operating with poor accuracy at low speed which is another way of saying very much you have a happy life. But she's not necessarily gonna have a very competitively successful life because that requires to be more uh… competitive you could say in terms of accuracy and speed operations. Again you have the power to control whether your brain advances or retreat it's really under your control. So choose forward by all means. So neurology still for the most part waits for and tries to understand and tries to cure the train wreck. The neurology basically has established, a basic of operations of what it's interested in by deciding, when you're sick enough to decide that you have a "disease." So from the time in the middle of life in the average human being you are in effect the average citizen is deteriorating and functionally and ultimately in the majority of individuals that live long enough this will result in disaster if you reach your 85th birthday, it's… you're approaching 50-50, that you're gonna be demented. And you're gonna need require continuous care. Okay, so neurology waits for that and they wait for the day in which they can say you meet the diagnostic criteria of Alzheimer's disease. You are really… you've got it now. In reality, what did you have a day before? What did you have a month before you're before, 10 years before, 30 years before? What did you have a year later? More Alzheimer's disease? This is a process, the brain is continuously plastic. The notion that, that, that you define the condition that the moment in which she retired… as a criteria, it is bullshit. It's just wrong. Of course, you wait until the brain is like the brain at the right or approaching that shrunken and full of damage before you think about driving to drive it correctively. Be a lot easier just to stop the train wreck. So let's think about this a little bit. So one of the ways we can index how brains are doing, is just to look out a series of ways that you're changing functionally from the prime of life and basically the peak performance in the average human is about roughly around the 30th birthday and you can than, then to go forward in, in life and you can look at performance characteristics of the brain in a variety of ways. I'm here looking at the performance characteristics in five different measures and uh… and uh… you can see four these are going down. And one of these is brain speed and then I think we have reasoning, a measured reasoning and I can't see what episodic memories another and uh… and uh… I can't see what the other one is, maybe visualization. So that we could… you could put 50 things on this line, decade by decade if you looked at the classic ways in which you just judge performance, you're losing about a third of a standard deviation in performance, for a decade. That's another way of saying if you're in the middle of the distribution when you're, when you're, when you're 30 on your 60th birthday your about the 15%, 16%. By the time you're at their 90th birthday you're in the canker, okay. So these changes are very significant and they actually index, how you're doing in aging. Of course, on the end, many people are gonna fall off the cliff. So you can look at this in a simple way here, in by looking at one of these indices and this is an index a processing speed and here we have a task it's on brainHQ, a website that I'll tell you about it, a little bit, a little later. And we're looking at the performance before people are trained in the red dots and what you see across the bottom is age people on the left uh… are on their 20th birthday and people right are in their 90th, 95th birthday and we're just looking at people as time goes by at their ability in the simple index of performance. This is a speeded uh… multitasking uh… related task and you can see that people basically are older systematically, poorer at this task as they get older up as worse. And now we train everybody to an equivalent, it's not. Everybody's trained on this task to decrement degree, or equivalent period of time. And what you see is that everybody improves. Everybody improves about equally independent of age, now one reason that occurs is because we know the conditions that apply for effective engaging the brain to up regulate the processes that control learning right? There's a myth that older people can't learn at the same rate or speed younger people, that's a myth. They can't unless you worry about, they can if you correct the down regulation of the machinery that controls learning rate than their learning is almost equivalent. We have to engage that that's a part of the training that's supplied to her. So and then we just look at a person, let's say at their high 75th birthday and we look at their performance after their training. So this is the blue, it's a trading performance. We see that with a full amount of training, they're now doing better, equal to the training that performance ability of the 20-year-old. Now we don't always see a movement that's all the way back like this but we often do. I might say that you could ask the question well uh… if I train the uh… if I train the older person longer will they ever approach the ability of the trained younger person and the answer is they get closer to them. But they never get to them on this physical average. So I can actually change… I can actually change this function so that it's flatter by training older people longer and basically when I do that I have uh… substantially restored the ability of the older person to the performance ability that's commonly superior to the young and untrained person. That's exactly what we saw on rats. Uh… performance gains on attention and speed, that are expressed here, must arise from a coordinated series of physical changes like those documented in trained rats. But here's another example, here we've trained individuals in, you know, in uh… in a auditory task and in this auditory task we're looking at the normal distribution of people in this… on this task when they're in the between, this is a little bit hard to see but the green boxes up to age 40, 30… the, and the yellow are up to age 70 and then uh… the red are above age 70 and, and this is a another speed fleet of processing task in which the individuals making a decision about what they just heard and then they basically have to recover from that make an accurate decision about the second thing, target they just heard. The question is how fast can they do that? Well turns out that a young brain can do it on the average about 6 or 7 times a second and the average older brain can do a average of two or three times a second. Well, this is the dramatic difference of the accuracy in which the brain can receive information flowing by and listening, for example, human language operations. It's a big difference. And now we train individuals that are in this red box and when we do that everyone, in the red box that's trained falls in this blue box, their performance level is equal to or better than the performance of individuals in the green box. Again you can drive them in performance at a task like this so that now they're resolving information with high accuracy at high speed with great reliability. So we hope that a whole series of studies like this but, you know, holes punch a different task and we see the same thing in every basic task performance and this relates very complexly to what's deteriorating in the neurology of these people as they age. And in every case if you just look at these horizontal lines, you could see that the trained older person by equivalent period of training is improving in their performance on a level in which their superior to the untrained younger person or equal to it, to them. We don't always see that but we see that in the majority of cases. So let's just look at one example of this from a study that was conducted and beginning about 13 years ago called the active trial. And they trained in a specific task, it was speeded like this. It was actually the task but it illustrated the performance of in uh… in the first slide, when I showed differences of the function of age from 20 to, to 95. So this is that at that task, on, on brainHQ that task is called "Double decision," so here where they… they're trained in series of individuals at that task. Uh… 13 years ago or so this task was centered in by group that was uh… from Chicago and uh… the 700 and some people were trained versus control uh… population and you see big improvements in this ability, they approximately uh… double the speed of operations in this particular measure index this is a visual task. They look a year later, with, with no training and they see that the ability is actually sustained. People are still faster. They take half the people in this trial and they train them for initial training was 10 hours in duration, they training them for another two to four hours. They wait a year and when… they look again and you see above the two there, is the performance a year later and you can see that ability is still substantially sustained. They're still operating much faster in making their distinctions about what they're seeing visually, more accurately. At the third year, they look again and they see that the ability is self sustained, but they again train the people that were trained with the booster shot the first time, they give them another two to four hours. So one group of individuals in the study have received 10 hours of training and another group of received uh… between 14 and 18 hours of training and then another group is control group, that's been doing other things. They look at 5 years, 2 years later with no training and they see the ability to still sustain. These individuals are 74 on the average when they started, and now 5 years later. They are 79. So this is a period of high risk for the onset of serious problems in, in life. And now they do nothing, in fact they've done nothing for two years but they wait another 5 years and they do nothing. And they look again and they see substantial… significant deterioration of this ability but still people are faster than they were before they initiated training a decade before, now people on the average are 84 years old. So from the study, they looked at a whole series of things that related to the performance of these individuals and I've, I've, I've just highlighted two individuals that are very prominent in these, in these studies in active trial in this form side of it. This is Carly Ball at, at the top. And she's a professor from the, from the universe of Alabama at Birmingham and Gerry Edwards is a professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa. The first thing to demonstrate is that across this period of time people are maintaining driving safety at mobility, and they've looked initially over the limited times only on study, and, and they look over longer and longer Epochs. They have quicker reaction times and safer on road driving, basically, we've come to an intersection and there's some reason why, why you should stop uh... going 30 miles an hour people stop 50 feet sooner. If they've been trained versus if it they're not. There's a 50% reduction to that at-fault crash… crashes up to 6 years they've now looked up to 10 years. So people just have far fewer traffic accidents and they maintain driving ability up to 10 years. Now this is important because the trainee didn't have a damn thing to do with driving. It had to do it with, with accurately interpret information in front of you and that sense it had to do with driving across the horizon at speed. And responding at speed, it had to do with sustaining brain scene. There were improvements of everyday performance. So basically uh… after training, there was a subway or retention of, of everything you did, you did in a faster way at 10 years, a benchmark people were still very greatly advantage in how fast they performed every day actions. And this is translates into every day action related improvements. People were protected against oppression that about a 40% reduction and the problem will they develop depression in their old age. And if they, and if they emerge they'd emerge in a weaker form, that improve locus of control. They're sustaining themselves better. They're, they're much more confident about their operations and independence, less than declined in quality of life over 5 years or less every day functions and that's the since it's been extended to 10 years. They have less everyday functional difficulty across 10 years and importantly in the final analysis that was just on this last year Jerry Edwards showed that they had an up to 48% reduction in dementia in incidence. So by doing this, training on a computer for the largest affects were a person that had to booster shots. Most of the incidents of dimension occurred in the 7 years after the second booster shot. Total amount of training on a computer was between… for those individuals was between 14 and 18 hours and that's just not a lot of investment to have a protection against the dementia. Now for people that did not have the booster shots, the protection was there was about a third less incidence of dementia. It still that's a protection from doing something for 10 hours, 10 years before, now, this points the way to regulating direction brain health. So what changes that when a brain struggles in it's old age. Well everything changes that we look at. What can be reversed by training? Well, it appears that everything can be reversed by training. We haven't found something so far that also human so we can drive correctly. How difficult it is to reverse the course of change? It's easy. A case intensive effort on the part of the person this is not trivial, it's not nothing. But it's remarkably easy. Can such training in humans delay or blocked the progression of dementia, well, it appears to be us that, that's, that's, that's so. Now we need… we're trying to do a lot larger population studies are trying to train now tens of thousands of people tracking their fates across time and most of all what we're trying to do is the obvious thing that that what should be done and I guess, we're trying to control the dosing in training to try to assure that everybody stays on a safe position as long as possible. Just like Etenne de Villar-Satani is trying to keep those rats alive, we're trying to keep humans alive and healthy out for the far distant future. Now how… well we can do that, how effectively we can do that? We don't know yet. So it's not just about delaying the onset of dementia. We're also trying to apply the same strategies to detect the risk of the onset of Parkinson's disease and we're trying to prevent its uh… or delay or prevent its occurrence again in the same way we're trying to delay the onset of expressions of inherited neurological disorders, we're trying to protect the primary target has been Huntington's disease, where people are gonna live a perfectly uh… for almost normal life until they're roughly 30 years of age then they're going to begin to deteriorate and around their 40th, 50th… the 50th birthday they're going to really start to collapse and have a terrible end, end stage. And we already know that we can have a dramatic impact on the progression of this disease by intensively training an individual and improving the resilience they have against these, these changes. Protection against the onset or treatment of depression, protection against schizophrenia and bipolar disease onset, I think that in most individuals at risk for schizophrenia onset the disease is probably preventable. I think you can probably normalize a brain enough so that basically it does not arise in the schizotypique kid. Recovery from their logical distortions attributed severe childhood abuse neglect and deprivation treatment of individuals with wounded brains, treatment of multiple sclerosis reduction of recurrent active disease episodes on all targets, and learning impairments, and performing limitation in children, and working adult population. So these are things that we're trying to do. We're entering a new era in brain health medicine in which every individual's neurological status can be now relatively inexpensively and continuously monitored. The risk of possible upcoming problems can be detected. Employing simple inexpensive multi-level biomarker strategies, some simple things we can do in recording for brains and there are activities, some simple things that we can do behaviorally. I came know how we now apply simple cheap assessment to continuously monitor cardiovascular and general health. So when you go to the doctor they say well how's your blood pressure, how is your… let's do an EKG, let's do the simple things. Let's listen to your heart rate, let's record all of these thing oxidation of blood and they have a first level picture of whether you need to be… your health need to be managed in some way but first they might say as, well let's change your lifestyle, a change how you're living your life to the advantage, in this case of your brain and then let's think about how we need to intervene to drive you in a stronger position and there are a lot of strategies we could use to do that and I think that's where we're going. We'll begin treatment by recommending holistic strategies to sustain brain health and other brain jam or other or invasive strategies will be a key resources to support this. In the future is the necessary will be restoring that all individual sustaining brain health, adopting positive lifestyle changes and these computer and other grade self healing strategies combined within built assessment that continuously define medical treatment outcome, this is where the future is. So uh… that's all I have to say about that and uh… we'll, we'll have some more to say about other things in a few minutes. 

00:58:35
UNKNOWN All right what questions might you have for Dr. Merzenich, you can come here and here, for our online attendees, please type in your questions and we'll get that question to Dr. Merzenich. Please come on up. 

00:58:50
UNKNOWN Hi I'm a student at the uh… Master's in arts and counseling program and either comment in a question. Umm… in the program we're learning that counseling is a profession adopts the wellness model, where umm… rather than debating where the invisible line that separates ill from health is located that it may be better to umm… map the continuum of health and that seems to be consistent with you… what you're talking about in the brain plasticity, would you say that's correct? 

00:59:20
MICHAEL MERZENICH Absolutely. 

00:59:25
UNKNOWN Umm… and my question is, you talked about the history of the adoption of the idea that the brain is plastic with some people, you know, over century ago, coming up with this concept and then that kind of became not fashionable and now it's umm… experiencing a renaissance. How did you become interested in this topic and tried to bring it back to the forefront? 

00:59:50
MICHAEL MERZENICH Right, uh… I'm sitting down because I'm old. Uh… and I told the who long people sit down every day, I'm one of… I'm one of the victims of that, just teasing, of course. But uh… well I have begun to realize as a scientist studying these issues and not just a Studies in the teucrium plant but studies that I was… I was interested in the functional organization of the, of the auditory system because I was interested in the basic neurological basis of human language. And I began to realize and studies were initiated at the University Wisconsin and later in my laboratory in the University of California in San Francisco, I've been to realize that the organization of the system could not be explained, it made no sense unless the brain was plastic. So at one point, I did experiments in which I investigated a potential for its plasticity and uh… I was surprised by the magnificent ways that the brain changed itself, when as we'd manipulated inputs from the experiments involved in manipulation inputs from the body surface to the brain 'cause that was a very easy model for us to explore, in monkeys. And I was shocked by how plastic it was and that led very rapidly to studies and in over, over a period of 2 or 3 years in which we engage the animals behaviorally and showed that it, you know, the acquisition of skill or ability was obviously accounted for by this plastic remodeling so uh… but with respect to your first uh… your first comment, the brain is continually changing itself and every time, every chronic disease that you can think of, the brain has actually gone through a progression. So schizophrenia, for example, doesn't come out of nothing. It actually originates, there's an inherited weakness and slow changes are occurring in the brain and ultimately, they begin to become to be expressed by behaviors that are gonna signal to us that the child in fact is at risk for a serious collapse into full blown schizophrenia. And we can actually detect that weakness we know its nature, scientists have shown in large uh… trial… it's a… look at large number of people in appropriate assessment, that long before even schizotypique behaviors emerge in, you can see the weakness expressed in other ways. So actually what we should be doing is we should be finding every child whether 8 or 9 or 10 years of age and we should… which we, we should be screening them all, to determine who has the weakness. And any child that has a weakness we should be trying to help them. So that they have resilience against any further decline, why wait until they even become schizotypique. So what we now are doing primarily on these outcome trials is that because we're in uh… collaborating with psychiatry that are trying to help these children, we wait until the child is already schizotypique and then we try to keep them from advancing to full blown schizophrenia or try to reverse that and we have strong impacts on doing that, but what we should really be doing is going back to a younger age still and just eliminating this in, so far as we can from the life, future life of the child. And we should be doing this in all kinds of ways, you could say we do this in other domains of health and I like… I like… like the cardiovascular example as a good example. We have all kinds of ways, we've all kinds of ways, very inexpensively do monitor how a person is doing and if we suspect something's wrong we look in, in greater doubt and ultimately, when we define the problems for that individual in front of us and have uh… relatively simple ways to things to try first and then that can be more advanced and ultimately they can be very sophisticated. We need medicine for the brain that is real medicine. You know, right now, we have sort of disaster, disaster relief. Right until the person is so insane that they can't control… can't manage, anything about their life and I say "You are you have a mental illness. We better do something," right? Wait until the condition is so desperate in them… in most of the… these things that and commonly that means that the pathology is in place and it is creating damage. That was unnecessary, why ever let it get to that point in a sense? And uh… so I think we're gonna revolutionize how we think about this. I think we're gonna come into a new era in which we actually have real brain health medicine. 

01:04:10
[sil.] 

01:04:20
UNKNOWN Hi, I'm just trying to chew on all of this that you're sharing because I've been sitting with umm… just this literature in the brain and especially, applying it to umm… people as far as isms, and racism specifically, and how we think about context and environment and how that damages or can hurt the oppressed group or even how it hurts the group that is the oppressor… 

01:04:45
MICHAEL MERZENICH Right… 

01:04:45
UNKNOWN And what it does to the brain and how the brain has to function and there's so many things that you said of just looking at umm… when there's too many cha… so many challenges to the brain and how there is this way that it can be resilient and bounce back and become even stronger? 

01:05:00
MICHAEL MERZENICH Right 

01:05:00
UNKNOWN That's kind of how I'm interpret in a lot of things but then with some of the mental health issues and how you say, well we wanna go and umm… help the, the individual with mental health things but what if the environment is forever oppressing or is, you know, that person is in that environment and then the… I guess, I'm… I don't know if I have a question or I keep like chewing and trying to think about the things you've shared and how that looks in the context or in the frame that I've been chewing on it. 

01:05:30
MICHAEL MERZENICH Right, it's a wonderful sets of issues, of course, it's complicated and its complications are one of the reasons that we haven't successfully dealt with it. Well, first of all, we haven't dealt with it because we have had such a wrong headed view of, of, of how to… how to… how to think about the child that comes to school and, uh… and doesn't, doesn't behave and doesn't perform and, and we have a long history in which we basically blame the child for their, for their poor behavior and their lack of performance and, of course, everything we did… do in that domain contributes further to the damage of the child but we don't have to actually damage the child. The child will damage themselves, if they come to school and they realize that they're not gonna succeed at it, and they realize that they're not going to be part of the social mainstream. So they're punishing themselves in all kinds of ways that are damaging their neurology. So it's… one of the fundamental problems with that sort of course is that, we now know from a science perspective how, how a terrible childhood… your early childhood difficulties in early life uh… just can be the family struggling. Nobody's, nobody's bad, just they are just struggling, things are just difficult for them. The child just has difficulties and that's all it takes basically to wound the child in a way that damaged them, the neurology basically, the learning machinery of the brain does not evolve in a way that, that gives the child equal advantage to that other kid sitting next to them if I was what I… I didn't have the time to do this in the last talk because I took… I talked too long and too much but I was gonna say that if you have a child that comes from a highly advent or from an advantage childhood that was Bonnie in my slide, Bonnie and Billy and you just count the number words are exposed to. You know, it can be 7, 8, 10 times more than a child that comes from a family that's struggling. You can just separate life from the children that come from families that are really thriving economically from families that are really struggling economically, there's a big difference. One kid in a, in a family that's struggling a lot of the interaction from the parent to the child is corrective, stop doing that, Billy. None of that should really quit it, right? Whereas on the in a family, it's really thriving most of the interaction from the, from the adult to the child is supportive, way to go, way to go Bonnie, nice job buddy, right? So the child comes to school and one child is very prepared for it, full of language, probably already reading. Everything about school, Evan loves conversation because conversation is generally a source of reward. The other child has all of these things undeveloped or underdeveloped and they come to school and it takes them about a millisecond to know they're not gonna be good at it. So commonly if they're a boy, they do what, what boys do like in the rest of the X chromosome, you know, we boys over react and they begin to act out, if a boy misbehaves in the first grade and fails. There's a more than equal chance of what will commit a felony before his 30th birthday. Now the problem we have is that we don't find these children and we don't do what we… what we are socially and morally obligated to do and that's to help them. And not allow this further burden to, to occur on them. No child should come to school and self identify themselves as a failure that should not occur, we should not allow that to occur and a final thing, I would say about this is that, you say quite right, rightly. That one of the complications is that, there are other people in the child's life that maybe contributing that are also maybe traumatized themselves and maybe contributing to the ongoing struggles to help the child. And that's why I believe it's so critical, all the people I work with are working hard in this, when you think of who we have to help? We have to help everybody, not just the child in the family or the foster family or whoever else is trying to help, we have to help everybody, everybody has to be a part of this. So what we're trying to create is a model of a healing center in a community and the healing center is going to educate every stakeholder and it's going to uh… be as concerned about the, the, the family or resident the child is living in, as much as they're concerned about the child but, of course, the child is who we're trying to help, if we did this and we found all these children and they're a large part of the human population and we've got limited an outcast society that we doomed to of being outcast in the society, what a transformation in society this would be and we would save massive amounts of money but most of all, we would save massive amounts of positive human lives and we should be doing this. We should be doing this, there's just no question. I have a dream about this and I've actually been writing a book about this and in which I suggest that we could transform this rapidly by creating a model that we could implement through the community colleges or the universities in America 'cause we have a good location almost every location to have this establish a center in which there could be the resources there, that support those population and help everybody in schools and in the, in the community find and help these children and uh… so this is a uh… this is one of my own sacred missions in life is before I quit is to try to, try to help see this happen. 

01:11:05
[sil.] 

01:11:10
UNKNOWN I'm gonna ask my most important question I actually have three umm… but I'll save it. Umm… I had the picture as you were talking about the umm… noise, at a slightly less than will hurt your ears level and that during that time after some exposure to that the brain slows down. That's the incident that sparked this for me, one of the issues that I keep trying to work on is umm… how to deal with umm… not wanting to be overweight and making it a part of the change that I seek. I suddenly was able to see for a moment and I'd like you to consider interpreting it in your model. Umm... that fast food represents noise and I suddenly could see for a moment that the umm… the concept of being vegan or some healthy life food relationship… 

01:12:10
MICHAEL MERZENICH Right 

01:12:10
UNKNOWN Could represent the activity that you train on, while they throw, you know, ice cream and chocolate or whatever it is that your weaknesses are at you and you learn how to focus on that other approach and I just umm… was interested in interpreting that game… 

01:12:35
MICHAEL MERZENICH Yeah, well, let's talk about it in a minute 'cause that's a it's a cover… we could talk about it, anyone of a number of ways. Uh… so first of all, you know, eating like every other thing is that urge to eat or not eat is a neurological process. So in a sense, you're there… there's a series of signals that come from your body that tell you that you should, you should feed and that and this is a good or logical control. So the appreciation that these processes are not sort of magical, you know, higher… you know, processes that operations in thought or mysteries. They're really not their biological processes and they're, they're subject to plastic change. You say, you look at me and you say well, you probably haven't changed a very effectively at yourself. And that's another, that's an issue. Now, let's talk about a little bit about obesity is in fact a… and, and a contributor to premature aging and senility. But it's complex… complicated as to why that so and it really hasn't been completely resolved about why that's so. For one thing, one of the most important contributors to umm… successful aging is sustaining mobility. So the more active you are physically and you're out of the world and you can do stuff and really engage in the world, the better, right? Because basically you wanna stimulate your brain on the basis of your interactions with the world so when you're umm… so your physical condition has a lot to do with that, you know, when you're in good physical shape and you're capable of getting out in the world and, and stimulating yourself while of the things that are out there the better, it's better for you, obviously, but then there are also things that directly relate to the biology of obesity and the response to, to, to, to it in your physical body that relates to your brain. And to the… and aspects of it relate to the sort of chemical… chemical nutrition of your brain and other things like that. And in general, it's not a… it's you have to think about brain health in terms of general health, or a whole series of things you should be thinking about from the point of view of the health of your body that contribute to the health of your brain. So uh… it's an important consideration. There are many important considerations like this that uh… come into play if you go down this long list of things that I listed… that I listed, you would you'd find a number of other things that will stimulate to think about things that you do. That can conceivably provide a basis of potential correction or improvement in your life.
