00:00:00
NADYA A. FOUAD  Let me give you a little sense of what I'm gonna do today. I'm gonna talk about the, uhm, an initiative that has been going on within APA, the benchmarks competencies and, sort of, the competency movement. And then, I'm going to identify two specific competencies to talk about: Multicultural Competency or Individual and Culture Diversity Competency and Advocacy Competencies. And then, because I know this is really about mentoring, I want to talk a little bit about how I came to care about these issues and care so deeply about them and talk to you about and of how that came about for me in terms of the mentoring I had and the background and contextual factors, uhm, that influenced me. And then, I'm gonna embarrass my students, some of whom are over there, raise your hands guys, yeah, uhm, by ta, by showing a little bit of collage of the student, uhm, of, uh, my mentees, some of my mentees. And then, come back and talk about, and I'm not gonna embarrass you too much, uh, then I'm gonna come back and talk about how I think we need to move forward into, in terms of mentoring for, uh, multicultural competencies. So, the, we have been moving in general in the, uhm, training of psychologist to a culture of competence. And, and the shift has been, watch this. (laughing) Is that cool? My husband said that was tacky but I just had those kinda cool. (laughing continues) The shift within professional psychology towards an emphasis on the acquisition of competencies as the primary goal. This is in comparison to our, you know, that's what we, that is the outcome we want in professional psychology. We want students to gain competency. So, educational programs are expected to produce competence, uhm, professional credentialing bodies are expecting us to produce a competent psychologist to begin, uhm, the policy makers expect competence, and consumers increasingly demand competence. Okay. So, as opposed to, uhm, the way we have been, you know, sort of, lear, the learning outcomes we are expecting of our students again is that competence that they can, that we have con, confidence that they are competent. Now, at the past, of course, but they are competent in the areas that are needed to be a professional psychologist. Uhm, it emphasizes what the learning is, it helps us focus on the progress of students through the program, it assist in determining the curriculum and training goals, advances the field and really most importantly protects the public. Okay. So, what does that mean? So, as opposed to setting the curriculum and all the first year students go to the curriculum and the second year students go to the curriculum and so on and so forth, we are really saying every student needs by the end of their doctoral training to be competent in these areas of psychology. 

00:03:45
Central Questions What is competence in professional psychology? What does it look like? How is it best assessed? 

00:03:45
NADYA A. FOUAD What does that look like? And how do we know we're measuring it across the developmental curriculum? So, the, uhm, benchmarks the, uh, let me back up a second and say that the, the competencies initiatives have really been going on in the last 10 years. One of the first competency initiative was done by the National School of Profession, National, NCS, Na, National Council of Schools of Professional Psychology who set out a series of competencies that were then followed up by a competencies conference, uh, sponsored primarily by the, by APEC, the, uh, internship, uh, organization, uhm, developed and the, they had about 200 people come together and really come to consensus around what are those competencies in general training in psychology. They include such areas as been able to establish relationships, been able to conduct assessment, been able to conduct interventions, uh, been able to have a scientific basis for your, your work, been able to do, uh, appreciate the contextual factors of individuals that individuals bring to, uh, therapy and been able to do a skilled intervention that's culturally appropriate. Okay. So, one of the things that once we identified what those, what the areas are then the next question was who, how do we know how students are progressing through those areas across the developmental trajectory. One of the key pushes on this initiative was a decision by the American Council, APA Council of Representatives, to recommend to state licensing boards that entry to the practice is at the end of the doctorate. Okay. What that means is that APA was recommending the abolition of the postdoctoral year. Now, every state licensing board has to take that up for themselves. Ohio has just passed that. Washington has passed that. I believe Utah and New Mexico have passed that and other states are beginning to do that. Most states will say you either have the training in the predoctoral, in your predoctoral training, 3,000 hours predoctoral or a combination of predoctoral and postdoctoral but the field is moving towards saying at the end of the doctorate you will be ready to enter practice. You can be licensed at the end of the doctorate. Okay. That pushes the owners on those of us in training prog, programs to say, "Okay." We need to say to licensing boards and to the consumer and to the public that when you get your doctorate in professional psychology, you are competent. Okay. So, the, the, uhm, owners is again on us to demonstrate that competent. So, what does that mean in the acquisition of competence across the training program? So, the benchmark group- 

00:07:10
BENCHMARKS WORKGROUP Chair: Nadya Fouad, Ph.D. Two-day meeting September 2006 Gathered individuals knowledgeable about domains of competence 32 member work group 

00:07:10
NADYA A. FOUAD - came together, I chaired that meeting two years ago, almost two and a half years ago now. Thirty-two members came together knowledgeable about areas of competence. Now, unlike the, uhm, many APA type of, of, uh, situation or, or meetings like this we did not have, oh, this person needs to represent this alphabet soup or this organization or that organization. This was really 32 people coming together to talk about competence and it was an unbelievable, unbelievably productive and probably one of the most, uhm, uh, really engaging, uh, work groups I've ever been part of. So, what we did, our goal was to build on that knowledge and acquisition of competence and understand that what that culture of competence was, operationalize a developmental model and, and better to understand what that entry level to practice really means. Uhm, the document, alright, you wanna go ahead and pass that out? I'm gonna talk through two of these competencies. I have the entire document is on, uhm, is on a website- 

00:08:30
Product of the Group A document that delineates competency benchmarks, or measurable standards of performance, that are developmental and integrated through the sequence of professional education and training: In press: Training and Education in Professional Psychology 

00:08:30
NADYA A. FOUAD - and I have the website at the back of the handout. There will be an article that is coming out I think in the May issue of Training and Education in Professional Psychology, uh, that, that delineates all 15 of these competencies but I'm gonna walk you through just two of them: the multicultural, individual cultural-diversity competency and the advocacy competency, just to show you what we're talking about in terms of, uh, this particular kinds of competencies. So, how are they organized? Every competency has, uh, there, well there are 15 core foundational, uhm, and functional competencies. Every competency has the essential components to the competency, so you'll see that when you get the document you're about to get out. The critical elements of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes for that competency. And then, behavioral anchors for those competencies. So, what do you have to see in order to know that a student has acquired that competency? Alright, so, if you look at the top of the individual cultural-diversity, uhm, competency you will see the definition of individual and cultural diversity as awareness, sensitivity and skills in working professionally with diverse individuals, groups and communities who represent various cultural and personal background and characteristics defined broadly and consistently, consistently with APA policy. Alright. Then, the essential components. Now, Patricia, uh, the, uh, person who was so kind as to send those words, uh, Arredondo and I were co-chairs of the multicultural guidelines and, uh, you can see, uh, knowledge of self in essential components A, okay, understanding of self as shaped by cultural and individual diversity. 

00:10:40
(e.g., cultural, individual, and role differences, including those based on age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, language, and socioeconomic status) and context 

00:10:40
NADYA A. FOUAD  Essential Component B, knowledge how others maybe shaped by individual and cultural diversity and context. 

00:10:50
(e.g., cultural, individual, and role differences, including those based on age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, language, and socioeconomic status) 

00:10:50
NADYA A. FOUAD And again, it's very broadly defined. Essential Component C which is the interaction of self and others as shaped by individual and cultural diversity and context. 

00:11:05
(e.g., cultural, individual, and role differences, including those based on age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, language, and socioeconomic status) and context 

00:11:05
NADYA A. FOUAD So, it's not enough to just know self and others how did they intersect. And then, essential component D- 

00:11:10
Applications based on individual and cultural context 

00:11:10
NADYA A. FOUAD - how do you apply that? Okay. Now, when you go to development across the, uhm, levels let's just take the individual cultural diversity component A. Alright. So, knowledge of self. The first, readiness for practicum is the ability, is, is knowledge, awareness, and understanding of one's own dimensions of diversity. By the time a student is ready to go into internship, they monitor and apply that knowledge of self as a cultural being in their assessment, treatment, and consultation. And by the time they are ready to enter to practice, they can independently monitor and apply that knowledge of self as a cultural being in assessment, treatment, and consultation. So, do you see the developmental trajectory of I know this. Okay, now, I'm certain to understand how to monitor this that I have access to that information, uh, as I go along. And then, by the time I'm entering it to practice I'm doing that on an independent basis. So, you can see the increasing, uh, trajectory of students being able to do that on their own to function as professionals. So, let's look at the behavioral anchors. 

00:12:40
Readiness for Practicum Demonstrates this self knowledge, awareness, and understanding. For example: articulates how ethnic group values influence who one is and how one relates to other people. 

00:12:40
NADYA A. FOUAD Under readiness for practi, practice, what do you wanna see when you're talk, when you want to be able to, to assess that a student is able to, uh, have an awareness of their own multicultural, uhm, awareness of self. They can demonstrate that and there's an example of this, uh, here. At the readiness fo, for, uh, internship level. Three ways you can see that. They understand and monitor their own cultural, you know, their own cultural identities. They use that knowledge of self in order to monitor their effectiveness as a professional. And then, they are able to critically evaluate that. Okay. So, when they go to readiness for entry to practice they can independently do that. They can regularly lo, regularly use knowledge of self to monitor and improve effectiveness. And that they are critically evaluating feedback, uhm, and initiating consulta, consultation around issues of diversity. Questions on that before I go on? So, again, the, the focus was to be able to identify behaviors that we can see and that we can grade over the developmental trajectory. Okay. So, I don't have, I'm not gonna take the time to go through, uhm C, D, you know, B, C, and D but, uh, that is done for all four critical, uh, essential components under multicultural, uh, development. Now, when you go to advocacy, you can see two components under advocacy. One, and, and the definition of advocacy is actions targeting the impact of social, economic or cultural factors. Alright. So, two components: Empowerment, empowering others, and the ability to do systems change. Not quite as easy as trying to make sure that somebody has an understanding of self and begins to independently monitor that. But if you take just empowerment development, the, at the, so these are the three developmental levels: Understanding the differences between individual and institutional level interventions and system's level change. So, knowing when your client comes in, what might be an individual intervention or what might be a more suicidally oriented, uh, needing to shift the institution. By the time a student is ready to go into internship, they are to be able to promote change to enhance the functioning of individuals. So, you're seeing increasing levels of empowerment and by the time they entered the practice they are to be able to promote change at the level of the institution, community, or society. So, again, you can see increasing complexity and independence in that. Okay. So, the behavioral anchors the, uh, ability to articulate the role of therapists. Readiness for internship: Identifying target issues, formulate and engage in the plan for action, and then understanding, demonstrating and understanding of the appropriate boundaries in terms of implementing that plan of action. 

00:16:20
Engages with groups with differing viewpoints around issue to promote change 

00:16:20
NADYA A. FOUAD And the entry to practice is that you develop alliances 'coz be, you cannot send the client out to battle races and by themselves. Do ins, you know, battle institutional races and by your, themselves but developing alliances so you, they know when and where it's appropriate to do that. So, like I said, any questions on that 'coz I'm moving on. We can come back to that. I hope to leave some questions at the end. 

00:16:45
Family background and context International experience Mentoring 

00:16:45
NADYA A. FOUAD So, how did I come to care so much? Because I've spent most of my professional career working on various aspects of cross cultural competencies. I came in to the field as a very brand new assistant professor and got the courage of, in fact, Darrel(ph), you don't remember this I'm sure but I got into a taxi cab with you and I'm sure your heart sink when I said, "Oh, my God, are you Dr. Sue?" (laughs) Uhm, uh, but I've cared about these issues all of my professional life and have worked on them in various groups of individuals lucky enough to do that with wonderful, wonderful people and colleagues across the country. Uhm, so, I thought I take a minute just to talk to you about how I got there and, and for whatever it's worth how the, these kinds of mentoring experiences, uh, sort of, shaped me. So, talks from about my family background and context. I'll talk about my international experience. It's important to know that I am the daughter of immigrants. Uhm, my father Egyptian my mother Brazilian who came to this country to study. And so, I am first generation American and the, uh, first, well, I'll show you in a minute. Ah, and then the mentor and I have been very fortunate to have through my, throughout my career. So, my beginnings. Kinda cross right there, huh. (laughs). They're my mom and dad, uhm, I was born in Ames, Iowa when my father was finishing his Ph.D. at Iowa's State University in Electrical Engineering. Ah, and the fact that I am the fourth generation professor is not in significant in my training, uhm, or in my, my career. Ah, after he was fini, after he finished his Ph.D., he went back, we went back to Egypt. Uhm, spent five years in Egypt and then went to Brazil, uhm, where we spent a year meeting my mother's family and when I went from Egy, my first language was English, my second language was French because my grandmother spoke to me in French, my third language was Arabic and when we went to Brazil I refused to speak Arabic anymore and learned Portuguese. Okay. And then, my father got a call from, Iowa's State University and so we ended up back in Ames, Iowa, and that's my little brother. Isn't he cute? (laughs) And we stayed in Ames, uhm, so I, I come, I had this very international experience and then in the middle of Iowa. Okay. And, uh, I love Iowa, I love Iowans but it is in the middle of Iowa and I had experiences, (laughing) well, I had experiences with people who would bring their children over to meet me because they had never met an Egyptian Brazilian before, you know. So, it was a very interesting kind of, uhm, childhood that I've refused to speak Portuguese once we came back. It was very important to be, be just like everybody else and play with Barbie dolls and, you know, uhm, go out in the middle of the street and sing the Supremes badly and, you know, (laughs) all those sorts of things that we did in the 1960s growing up. 

00:20:00
Middle/High School 

00:20:00
NADYA A. FOUAD  Then my dad came home one day and said we're going to the Philippines. And, uh, there's a very bad picture of the Philippine Islands but we, we, uh, did move. I moved in 7th grade, at the end of 7th grade to the Philippine Islands to a very affluent ex-patriot life. My father was working at the University of the Philippines on a what must have been a huge Ford Foundation grant because we had Ford Foundation housing, we had Ford Foundation car, we had Ford Foundation servants, we had Ford Foundation everything. And the, on the way over, we traveled in between years, we were there two years, we traveled a lot. I got to see parts of the world that I have never been back to since but it really shaped my thinking in those small part because we went to Egypt now but at the time I, we went back to Egypt I was 13 and very much able to appreciate this enormous family. Uhm, my growing up in Ames, just the four of us, uhm, in, in, uh, Ames and then they, at that time you could come on to the tarmac. We looked at on the tarmac, where the plane landed in Egypt and there were hundreds, I'm sure not really, but it felt like there were a hundreds of people standing there all of them full legs(ph) and held two knees. And this whole family that I had just as really no clue, I mean, I had a clue but not really a clue of what that meant to belong in terms of that environment and that culture. And the other thing I saw tremendous amount in Egypt was I had never seen poverty like this. Uhm, it is to this day, of course, to, to, I, I hate tremendous amount of poverty and, uh, it was my first experience with this level of poverty. And then, to go to the Philippines and see the level of poverty there, uhm, juxtapose the, you know, there, there was no zoning so you saw this level of poverty coming in to the, uh, you know, to anywhere you went. You would see people living in unbelievable poverty and yet we were living this, this is a picture of the Polo Club of Manila, uh, I couldn't get an unappropriate, uhm, un, uncopyrighted, uhm, picture but it is, it is, uhm, the club that, you know, they played polo. They held the Davis Cup there, they have, you know, tennis courts. I mean, it was, it was an unbelievably privilege life and the girl from being in a ranch house in Ames, Iowa to going to a house where we had two, two, with a maid, we had a, a living maid, a cook, we had a driver, we had a gardener, we had the seamstress. The seamstress came over every Friday to make whatever we wanted. It was an unbelievably different life, uhm, and it, uh, it was very difficult to make sense of that level of affluence compared to the level of poverty that was all, all around us. Uhm, and I'm not gonna tell you I really necessarily made sense of it except to say that it really did influence my background. So, we left the Philippines and guess what? 

00:23:20
High School & College 

00:23:20
NADYA A. FOUAD We went back to Ames, Iowa where I graduated from high school and I graduated from college, uhm, and, I was able to meet mentors like Don Sykowski(ph) and more critically Fred Morgan who was wonderful talk, took a class from him in Counseling Psychology and he said, "You know what? You really ought to go to graduate school in Counseling Psychology and why don't you think about the University of Minnesota," which fits for me, uh, I'm sorry to say not because it was the top program in the country but because I had a boyfriend who's still in Ames and, you know. So, thinking about career development that was pretty, those, those interpersonal things make a difference. So, by the time I went to graduate school the threads that were sort of influencing my thinking were things like these international exposure, the incredible gap in poverty, between poverty and wealth and the injustice of that, the, di, the issues I had would be different, not wanting to be different, enjoying being different, wanting to look like everybody else, not looking like everybody else. I'm just, you know, again, I'm not gonna tell you I, I resolve those struggles but that was influencing me. Uhm, I decided that I really wanted to help people and I was the youngest volunteer at the, uh, crisis line in Ames. So, I was very involved with, you know, during the midnight to three shifts where you're taking the call about somebody who wants to commit suicide. Uhm, and I really wanted to make a difference. My father had been, uhm, involved in a, uh, program called Technology and Social Change which was the, what happens to a culture when technology gets infused into the culture. And I, it was, from the very anthropological perspective I thought this was gonna be really interesting but what about, what happens at the individual level. So, I was interested in knowing what happens at the individual level when culture, when there's cross-cultural interaction. Okay. And I was very interested again on fourth generation Ph.D. so that was expected in my family. So, I went to the University of Minnesota and I met this fabulous group of people and every graduate student in here, everybody who's part of a cohort, just look at the flags. 

00:25:50
Mentors: Grad School 

00:25:50
NADYA A. FOUAD We have been getting together at APA for 25 years. It is a wonderful supportive, we were all in graduate school together and we often have a glass of wine in our hand at APA but we always makes (laughing) time to, you know, to get together and over the years now we have, uhm, also had mentored our students. And we have, uh, Jeff Prince, for example, is the, uh, editor of the Practice Forum for the journal that I edited. I just published a book with Jane Swanson so we have continued to work together and most critically have absolutely supported each other. Like I said, lot, lots of, lots of glasses of wine out there. The last picture here that you're about to see is, in fact, the man at the top is David Campbell who was advisor's adviser with three of, four of us in the middle there, we're all graduate students together on to Jo-Ida Hanson and the woman on the left is A.J. Metz who is now an assistant professor at the University of Utah and was my student. So, I really do come from a tradition of mentoring and really trying to help students to feel part of a community. The collage of mentors, before I click this I wanna tell you that the cla, first class I took in Cross Cultural Counseling was from this man, right here, Samuel Johnson, he's so great, he was great, you are the TA for Paul Patterson. And I have to tell you I went to the University of Minnesota, uhm, really wanting to study cross-cultural counseling. Paul Patterson had left by that time or was leaving before I ever got to meet him and it was wonderful to go to this class in cross-cultural counseling and learn Triad, Triadic, the Triadic Model because cross-cultural differences and I'm gonna, you're gonna laugh when I say this but it really is true. Cross-cultural differences in Minnesota were the difference between Norwegian and Swedish or Norwegian and Danish and it, and it is, you didn't laugh, but it is true. (laughing) It is true that it is, it is a culture that's, that the individuals within that group see great differences among the cultural groups but when you're outside of it, it feels more homogenius. So, it felt again like, although you saw the wonderful people that I connected with, it didn't feel like a real, a place that I could really, uhm, 

00:28:25
Mentors: 1984 - now 

00:28:25
NADYA A. FOUAD work a lot about cult, cross-cultural differences. But I've met wonderful groups of people and the person- 

00:28:35
Mentors: Grad School 

00:28:35
NADYA A. FOUAD - on the left that you just saw was Jo-Ida Hanson, my mentor. And so, these are the mentors over the years. The people that I've had, uhm, just wonderful opportunities to connect with through vocational psychologies, through, the counsel counseling psychology training programs. Mark Savickas and Nancy Betz, Robert Carter and I were on the new professionals panel together many years ago. These are the Minnesota grads who are at the Lehigh Conference. John Holland, Lenore Harman who was just a wonderful mentor. My colleagues, just taken on Monday. Jean Carter who I worked very closely within society, cultural psychology. You know what? That's my best mentor, that's my husband. So, my threads that I came out of graduate school went into my work as, as an assistant professor really included a deep commitment and I'm fascinated with learning about how people make career choices and the social justice issue of work is such a social equalizer. When you understand and create equal opportunities for people to work that, I think is, makes the difference. I, I came through very interested in cross-cultural counseling. I was strongly mentored into professional service and the, the strong, uh, commitment to presenting and giving back to the professions, to professional service and through the mentoring that I do as part of the community in counseling psychology. I also, uhm, got this incredible work ethic from my father that, uhm, what can I say, you know, he's my father. Return the phone calls, do, you know, be, uh, responsive and responsible and, uh, care a lot about your students and, you know, get the job done. And, oh, and if you don't do it right the first time you're gonna do it again. So, it muscled you right at the first time. So, strong mentoring from my father. Again, the professional service strong emphasis on professional service. 

00:30:40
Mentoring 

00:30:40
NADYA A. FOUAD And then look at all my wonderful students. I've been so fortunate over the years to get to, I don't know how many I've graduated and I get to do I think three or four more in May, uhm, they have written with me, they, we've presented together, we've, uhm, I've tried to introduce them to people at conferences sometimes they get annoyed with me about that. Uhm, May Tague(ph) is now at the University of Cincinatti. Those students ma, many of them are in internship this year. So, it's really been a wonderful, uh, wonderful opportunity to get to, uhm, be involved with students and, and, uh, my colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. And they'd probably tell you that there's usually glass of wine above of that, too. 

00:31:30
Mentoring for MC and Advocacy Individual mentoring: Relationships Program Mentoring: Creating expectations New Professionals: Role Modeling 

00:31:30
NADYA A. FOUAD Alright, so, when I bring it back to mentoring for multicultural, uhm, competencies and advocacy competencies I can look at this in three levels. I think that that mentoring for multicultural and advoc, advocacy competencies has to begin at the individual level. You know, I'd, I, I teach the first year practicum for the doctoral students. We're talking about that, at that, uh, we're talking about multicultural competency, we're talking about how you include issues of diversity in your, in your practice and in the case conceptualizations and thinking about it, asking them the kinds of questions that I hope will encourage their thinking in terms of this. Uhm, I have really worked very hard to create the kind of program I want to be part of at UWM. Uhm, so, I am very proud of my colleagues and the work we do, we, we work hard and, uh, try to challenge each other and try to, uhm, you know, and, and try to build competence in ourselves so we can help to build competence in our students. And then the, the last piece is one that I feel also very strongly about is mentoring for new professionals in the field and the, you know, part of my work as an editor I know I have to make hard decisions but one of the things I enjoyed doing is, sort of, being involved with the development of, of new scholars. 

00:33:00
On going process Benefits to all Easier to ask hard questions earlier Everyone develops at their own pace Time commitment critical to develop relationships 

00:33:00
NADYA A. FOUAD So, some lessons learned, uhm, multicultural competency is an ongoing process and having those difficult decisions is a, on, is an ongoing process in learning how to have those difficult decisions and, or discussions and how to talk about race and how to, more critically how to talk about race and anything else is one of the, uhm, is an ongoing process and I would tell you right now I'm not done and I'll bet none of you are done. It's something that we have to continue to work on and have to continue to figure out how to meet in the middles so that we can both learn from each other. But when we do, it is of benefit to all. It is easier to ask hard questions earlier. One of the things about the competencies is that it is he, it helps to anchor behaviors in, uhm, language that helps you to talk to students earlier than later. So, the intern who really doesn't know how to talk, how to, how to incorporate cultural differences that student should have been talked to as a beginning doctoral student. So, having those conversations earlier. But by the same talk(ph) and everyone develops at their own pace. So, the shoulds of "you should be here at this point" is I think, uh, uhm, stepping back and being a little more comfortable with understanding that. At some level, you need to move forward but that people are developing at their own pace and that it takes a lot of time, but that time is critical. Uhm, where do we go here? Ah, just a couple of things I just wanna mention because, uh, I got the hi sign here is that we really need to study this stuff. We really need to know what works, uhm, how do we help students to continue those multicultural competencies, how do, and then, uh, we even touched on advocacy training, you know, when, when part of what Dr. Trimble is talking about this morning is the respect for the community and helping the community from what helps the community from within their perspective. Uhm, how do you blend that with training needs when you've got maybe, uh, 10 or 16 weeks semester and go in, have you, have your students do advocacy come out for a, a month or three months in the summer, it's not respectful. So, we need to learn how to develop those alliances and do it in ways that are good for everybody. Uhm, I have students who are more competent than their suprvisors in multicultural issues. Uhm, how do we deal with that? As a, as a, you know, the culture of competence is shifting and my students are able to say but he didn't even talk about race. Well, I don't have the same power over him to talk about races I do over you. So, let's talk about how you can begin to encourage those conversations. And then, how do we continue to do formative assessment? You know, so, in holding people accountable for their, uhm, development of competence.
