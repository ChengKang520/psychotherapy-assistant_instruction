Roadblocks and Promising Practices 

00:00:10
Brandon Hamlett Social Studies Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 

00:00:40
BRANDON HAMLETT Advisory has, it's been a great support for our students in a number of ways, especially for postsecondary planning for their own lives. What I always think about is a lot of our students don't have the support like I did when I was a kid as far as, have you been applying to schools? You know, my parents and just different people in my life talking about those things. And a lot of our students don't have that. So we really were the college support line and uhm, really the information line for a lot of like, deadlines and just different ways you can find free money out there through scholarships. 

00:01:10
Kathy Ryan Principal, Lanier HS, Austin 

00:01:10
KATHY RYAN With a ratio of counselors of one to about 400 students, there's no way a counselor can do every single kid justice like that. It's, it's just not possible. Uhm, and so some of the things that counselors, you think of traditionally do, doing, are done by advisors. And we have to do that so that our kids can continue to be successful. 

00:01:35
Bianca 

00:01:35
BIANCA At the end of the semester every year, since ninth grade, we looked at our transcripts. We totaled up our GPA and we start looking at things that we, looking at grades and seeing what colleges or what we want to major in and stuff like that. 

00:01:45
Valerie Milburn Advisory Coordinator, Lanier HS, Austin 

00:01:45
VALERIE MILBURN There's very strong research that shows the earlier you start thinking about college the more likely you are to go. 

00:01:50
Virginia Jose Visual Arts Teacher, South Bronx Preparatory: A College Board School, NYC 

00:01:55
VIRGINIA JOSE Sometimes they don't know that they can actually succeed. They don't know. A lot of these kids are their first generation in their family going to college. So we have a lot on our hands to ensure that confidence. 

00:02:05
Tanisha 

00:02:05
TANISHA With her talking to us and like, showing us that there's better things out there, it's all clear, maybe I can, you know, go to a four year college. Like she helped me believe that I could get into you know, UT or Texas State or you know, something like that.

Postsecondary Support: Career Lineup Gathering Lanier High School, Austin, TX 9th Grade Advisory 

00:02:20
Michele Tissiere ESR Facilitator 

00:02:20
Michele TissiereSo, the first thing we're going to do is a gathering. And it's called a career lineup. And I, I always have an expectation that everybody in their mind has an option for a career, whether you're a fourth grader, a ninth grader, an eighth grader. But you're really thinking about what do I want to do with my life after high school? And hold a belief in yourself around that. So right now, I want you to think about a career, just one career for the moment, and you think, you know what, I have an interest in that right now. It's on my mind. You're going to take 60 seconds and think about it privately, and then I'm going to tell you the next step. Okay. 60 seconds. I'll look at my timer. 

00:03:10
[sil.] 

00:03:15
MICHELE TISSIERE Can you go like this, thumbs up if you're ready? Beautiful. Here's the next set of directions. Think of the first letter of your career. Okay? A is going to be next to me. And Z is going to be over here. I want you to get up and align yourselves. Line up based on the first letter. So A is here, so it'd be like, A for architect or B for-, C-. Stand up. A is on my right hip. So you figure out. You have to talk to each other but don't just say, mine begins with a B, mine begins with a C. 

00:04:00
[sil.] 

00:04:00
MICHELE TISSIERE Just say the first letter.

[sil.] 

00:04:15
MICHELE TISSIERE You guys are good. Keep talking to each other. Keep talking to each other. What's going to happen right now is you're going to take a chair, so you are here. You're there. Move down, each take a chair. Perfect. Are we ready to roll? Okay. I'm actually going to backwards, starting from Z this way. And all we, all we want to know right now, just to know a little bit more about each other, is what's that one idea right now that you have about for a career?

00:05:35
MICHELE TISSIERE Yeah? You want to be an anthropologist. So we're learning a little bit about each other. 

00:05:40
Valerie Milburn Advisory Coordinator, Lanier HS, Austin 

00:05:40
VALERIE MILBURN One of the things we do in the ninth grade that we've just started doing that we found to be really interesting and effective is we started with a list of college vocabulary, just all the words associated with college. And the kids really didn't have any idea. They didn't, first of all they didn't know the difference between the ACT and the SAT or what SAT stood for. They had no idea that there was money available for college, you know? And they need to learn FAFSA from the very beginning, because FAFSA is such a big deal. And uhm, so those words were great. And that was an exercise that advisors said they had uhm, a captive audience for. 

00:06:20
Postsecondary Support: College Questions Carousel Lanier High School, Austin, TX 11th Grade Advisory 

00:06:25
BRENDA PORTA Well, hi. Just hold on to that for me please. How are you? 

00:06:30
UNKNOWN Good, how are you? 

00:06:30
BRENDA PORTA Good, thank you. Take that. Hello, Jacob. How are you? 

00:06:45
[sil.] 

00:06:50
BRENDA PORTA Hello, boys. How are you? Just hold on to them for me. So just hold on to your little Post-it for me. 

00:07:05
[sil.] 

00:07:05
Brenda Porta English Teacher, Lanier HS, Austin 

00:07:10
BRENDA PORTA College isn't just four years. There's two years, four years. You also have certificate programs. So know that there's an option for you. So with that in mind, we'll move on to our activity. We've got a little college carousel, and if you see around the room, we have different topics. Okay? Your topics have, we have dorms and living options, academic classes and workload, degrees and schools, cost and finances, and campus life. So, what I want you to do is find the person who has your same color Post-it, and you're going to go to a poster board. I'm going to go around and hand you guys a marker. Your marker is going to be your third partner. So you move with your marker, okay? Because on your board, on your posters, you are going to write a question that you might have about that topic. Yeah? Questions? Okay, so you'll get with your partner. Go ahead and write as many questions that you and your partner come up with in the minute that you have at each poster. Ready? 

00:08:25
[sil.] 

00:08:30
UNKNOWN If it's the same like in the movies. 

00:08:35
UNKNOWN Can you work while having classes? 

00:08:40
BRENDA PORTA All right. Let's move. Let's go ahead and go clockwise, and move to your next poster. Okay, ready? Here we go. One minute. 

00:08:55
Marne Gulley English Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 

00:09:00
MARNE GULLEY The students seem to create the excitement and the sparks about college amongst each other. And then, is college for me? And when are hearing from classmates and then seeing students uh, who have similar backgrounds than them talking about it and living it, I think it makes it more possible. And then, that's when I see them coming back to me really serious about, What do I need to be doing right now? And should I start on this scholarship? 

00:09:20
UNKNOWN So, you get three credits per semester, and if it's a three credit class, they're all the same. 

00:09:30
BRENDA PORTA If it's all-, well some classes are four credits, okay? But usually they'll be like three. But per semester, you could average 12, 15 credits. 

00:09:40
UNKNOWN Okay. So, same credits, same tuition price? 

00:09:45
BRENDA PORTA Right, well it depends on how many credits or how many classes you take, your tuition. All right. Good job. Let's go ahead and switch. 

00:10:00
[sil.] 

00:10:05
BRENDA PORTA Okay, here we go. Next poster. 

00:10:10
UNKNOWN Can we take art classes? Do they, do they have classes that can stretch around your working hours? 

00:10:15
BRENDA PORTA Those are good questions. 

00:10:20
UNKNOWN And do we still take uhm, like math and science in college too, right? Is that a good question too? 

00:10:25
BRENDA PORTA That could be one, yeah. 

00:10:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:10:30
BRENDA PORTA All right. Thank you. That was good. Good job, you guys. You did excellent. What I want you do to now, is choose one of those questions, circle it, and as soon as you do that, just come back and meet me in the circle please. So, is there one in particular that we want to talk about? 

00:10:50
UNKNOWN Uhm, yes. The, the classes, the workload. 

00:10:50
BRENDA PORTA Okay, classes and workload? Does that sound good? 

00:10:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:10:55
BRENDA PORTA All right. So let's see our question here. Is there a limit of classes you need to take? So, what are you thinking about it? Do you think we're going to have a limit. 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN No. 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN I think that you can take as many classes as you want. 

00:11:10
BRENDA PORTA I believe if you are on scholarship, you're going to have to take a certain amount. If not, they won't cover it. 

00:11:20
UNKNOWN "What if you're an athlete?" 

00:11:20
BRENDA PORTA If you're an athlete, I think, you know, I'm not too sure exactly because I wasn't one. But, I think you do also have to have a certain amount of classes. And obviously, especially if you're an athlete, for like a university, you're going to have to have a certain GPA. And that goes for scholarships as well. If you don't keep that GPA that they require, they'll drop you. All right. So I know that there's a lot of questions that you guys have about all these topics. And we are going to make sure that we get to each and every one of your questions. And if I can't answer that for you, this is when we're going to work together and figure out and find the answer, okay? And if you have any other questions that come up in the next couple of days, write it down. Bring it in to class. We'll discuss it. That's what I'm here for, and that's why we're here together. 

00:12:10
Ellen Flanagan Principal, South Bronx Preparatory: A College Board School, NYC 

00:12:10
ELLEN FLANAGAN And there's a resilience and a persistence that we need to delve into that makes them realize they can make it. Because that's our goal, not to graduate from high school, but to graduate from college. 

00:12:20
Terry Quiros Counselor, South Bronx Preparatory: A College Board School, NYC 

00:12:20
TERRY QUIROS It's a big collaborative effort in this school. So, for instance, we just completed SAT registration for our juniors. And it was the advisors that, that helped register every junior. And we have 100 percent registration. 

00:12:35
Kathy Ryan Principal, Lanier HS, Austin 

00:12:35
KATHY RYAN We have to balance, balance things out, and make things equitable. They need more time understanding the whole process of what it's like to go on to college if that's the path that you choose. What it's like to have to fill out all those forms. I mean, it's daunting. Uhm, if you've had a kid of your own go through college recently, you know. There's tons of paperwork and, and tons of avenues for students who can't afford it. 

00:13:00
ELLEN FLANAGAN So our kids need to become savvy. They need to be able to navigate the system. And it's a tricky system. And they do not have parents, necessarily, or guardians, or grandmothers who are able to navigate that. 

00:13:10
Sir 

00:13:10
SIR Basically, they take data from why past students who should have went to college and would have but didn't because of little things that like, okay you missed, you didn't go because of your FAFSA? Well they bring it to you, like well, here's your FAFSA. 

00:13:20
CAROLYNN And on top of that, if you needed to, you could go in and tell your advisor I'm struggling with this part. I'm struggling with this. I'm getting ready for college or getting my applications in or whatever, and they'll help you out. So that really helped because, like in a regular school without advisories, you wouldn't have that kind of support to get you where you need to go.

00:15:20
ELLEN FLANAGAN Lots of times when you are talking about college, and there's that aspiration of college. And you can say, yeah, I'm, I'm absolutely going to college. The aspiration alone can't carry you through. 

00:15:30
Brandon Hamlett Social Studies Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 

00:15:30
BRANDON HAMLETT They want to go to college, but they don't necessarily know the steps to get to college. 

00:15:35
Terry Quiros Counselor, South Bronx Preparatory: A College Board School, NYC 

00:15:35
TERRY QUIROS My experience has been over the years that our students get almost no information from the outside. Not from their families and not from the community. So advisory was going to be a way, uhm, to get that information to students slowly. By the time they get to eleventh grade many things are already in place. We're not starting from scratch. 

00:16:00
Mariah 

00:16:00
MARIAH You know, they invited us to look for colleges and life after high school, but also to like, you know, be well prepared and stuff, like emotionally.

Postsecondary Support: Career Pictionary Lanier High School, Austin, TX 11th Grade Advisory 

00:16:15
JOSEPH KANKE Today we're going to start off with an activity called Career Pictionary. Uhm, how many of you are familiar with Pictionary? Okay, what is Pictionary? 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN It, Pictionary is when you pick a topic and then you go on the board and you draw it. And everybody, your team has to guess what it is. 

00:16:30
Joseph Kanke English Teacher, Lanier HS, Austin 

00:16:30
JOSEPH KANKE That's exactly right. So the only difference between the Pictionary that you might be used to playing, maybe in some of your other classes, and what we're going to do today is all the things that you're going to be drawing today are going to focus on careers. So what is a career? 

00:16:45
UNKNOWN A job. 

00:16:45
JOSEPH KANKE A job, yeah. It's another word for a job, okay? So did-, before we, before I give you the rules I'm going to go ahead and divide you into two teams. What's going to happen is one person's going to draw a slip from the box, and then that person will have one minute exactly to draw. You can't talk or use any movements. Okay? So let's say for example, if the job was a plumber, you can't be doing this. You can only draw. And you can't use any letters or numbers. And you as a team can continue guessing until the minute's up. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you a slip of paper and I'm going to give you one minute as a team to give me the order in which you guys are going to draw. Now, if there's one person in your group that's not comfortable with drawing, that's okay. But they can still guess for you. Does that make sense? Okay. So discuss among your groups for one minute and try to come up with an order that you guys would like to draw. 

00:17:45
[sil.] 

00:17:55
JOSEPH KANKE All right. Perfect. Does everyone have their order? And according to your roster, Jose, you will be the first person to draw. 

00:18:10
[sil.] 

00:18:25
UNKNOWN Uhm, is it our team that's asking or is it their team that's asking? 

00:18:25
JOSEPH KANKE You'll be guessing, because he's on your team. So you're trying to guess what he's drawing. 

00:18:30
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:18:30
JOSEPH KANKE Good question. Ready? Are you comfortable? You have an idea? 

00:18:35
JOSE Kind of. 

00:18:35
JOSEPH KANKE Kind of? Okay. Kind of's better than not at all. All right. Go ahead. 

00:18:45
[sil.] 

00:19:05
UNKNOWN Is that a computer? 

00:19:10
UNKNOWN Is that a web design? 

00:19:10
JOSE Yeah. 

00:19:15
JOSEPH KANKE Good job. Okay. That was very good. So, I really enjoy the way-, Were you trying to go with a spider web? Was that what you were doing? 

00:19:20
JOSE Yeah. 

00:19:20
JOSEPH KANKE Like a web? That was clever. I like that. Jose is going to read you some facts about that job. So this job is a web designer, and he's going to tell you how much school you would need to be a web designer. He is going to read you something called the average entry wage and then something called the average annual wage. And we'll talk about those. But I'm going to let him go ahead and read that. 

00:19:40
JOSE Okay. It says education required is two years uhm, associate degree or a one year certificate (crosstalk) 

00:19:45
Valerie Milburn Advisory Coordinator, Lanier HS, Austin 

00:19:50
VALERIE MILBURN In tenth grade, we have them focus more on careers and what kind of education will be required to get to that career. 

00:20:00
JOSEPH KANKE All right. So, thank you, Jose. So I just want to talk, because all these slips are going to have this term. It's called entry average annual wage. And then the average annual wage. And the first one, the entry is $44,430 and the second one $75,080. So since the first one's smaller and it's called entry what do you think that wage might signify? Does anyone have any idea? Jose? 

00:20:25
JOSE Once you get better at it, that's when they're going to pay you the 70, or higher 

00:20:30
JOSEPH KANKE Yeah, excellent. Do you mind if I rephrase that for everyone, just so they catch it? What he said to me is exactly right. The first wage is what you will get the first year you're out of college. So you have no experience. Right? You just have your degree. And then, the second wage is what you'll get once you're more seasoned, once you have some years of experience. Okay. Good job, Team One. Are we ready for Team Two? 

00:20:50
UNKNOWN No. 

00:20:50
JOSEPH KANKE No? Well, ready or not Isvelda (ph), you are up. 

00:20:55
[sil.] 

00:20:55
ISVELDA Use this? 

00:21:00
JOSEPH KANKE Any one you want. 

00:21:05
[sil.] 

00:21:10
JOSEPH KANKE You can do that one, right? 

00:21:10
ISVELDA Yeah. I got it. 

00:21:10
JOSEPH KANKE All right. I'll hold it for you. Are you ready? You can tell me when. 

00:21:15
ISVELDA All right. Yeah. 

00:21:15
JOSEPH KANKE Go. 

00:21:20
[sil.] 

00:21:40
JOSEPH KANKE You guys can start guessing whenever. Do you have any ideas? 

00:21:50
UNKNOWN Hairdresser. 

00:21:50
ISVELDA Yeah, you're right. Pretty much. That's pretty much it. Uh, it's, the career was uh, hairdresser cosmetologist. Uh, education required is training programs range from a few months to two years. A state license is required. The entry average annual wage $15,590. The average annual wage is $25,750. 

00:22:20
[sil.] 

00:22:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:22:25
JOSEPH KANKE Ready? 

00:22:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:22:25
JOSEPH KANKE Okay. I'll start the timer right when you start drawing. Oh, let me get you a new page here. 

00:22:35
[sil.] 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN Painter? 

00:22:45
UNKNOWN What? 

00:22:45
UNKNOWN Plumber. 

00:22:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:22:50
[sil.] 

00:22:50
UNKNOWN Okay, education required is training programs at a technical school or a community college combined with on-the-job training or a four to five year apprention (ph)? 

00:23:00
JOSEPH KANKE Apprenticeship. 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN Apprenticeship programs with a master plumber. 

00:23:05
JOSEPH KANKE All right. So we've looked at three careers today. We have the hairdresser. And we have a plumber. And we have a web designer. The web designer has a, four year bachelor's degree, $44,000. The plumber has a community college with job training, so a two year degree, $27,000. And hairdresser is a two year degree, $15,000. So do you see any correlations? 

00:23:35
ISVELDA Pretty much, what it is is like, the more time you go to school, the more money you get. 

00:23:40
JOSEPH KANKE Yeah, and that's, I mean there's always going to be exceptions to the rule, but generally that is something to keep in mind. Often times if you go to school longer, you make more money. But you shouldn't just choose a career or uhm, or a college based on how much you're going to go to school. If you're passionate about something, like you are about cosmetology, uhm, if you're passionate about something that should be the driving thing behind what you want to do because that's where you're going to spend a lot of your life.

00:25:10
VALERIE MILBURN The most important thing in the senior year in the second semester is scholarships and FAFSA. The main determinant of whether or not a student goes to college is whether or not he or she feels out the FAFSA. And that's brand new research out of the Department of Education. 

00:25:25
ARLENE STEWART Okay. Well, grab a partner and share your FAFSA fact with your partner. And your partner shares their FAFSA fact with you. And when I say freeze, I would like for you to stop, find another partner to share your FAFSA fact with. Are there any questions? 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN No. 

00:25:45
ARLENE STEWART Let's mix and mingle. 

00:25:45
UNKNOWN FAFSA is a type of financial aid. Financial aid is particularly grants and college sponsored aid and assistance. The earlier you apply for it, the better you are to receive the amount you qualify for. 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN My FAFSA fact says that almost every student is eligible for some kind of financial aid irregardless of the income or (inaudible ), but you really need to complete the FAFSA in order to get it. 

00:26:10
UNKNOWN Mine says it takes about one to two hours to complete a FAFSA application, but any problems you have can add on to this time. 

00:26:15
UNKNOWN Oh, cool. 

00:26:15
ARLENE STEWART Let's go ahead and return to our seats so we can finish up advisory today. I just wanted to really, really emphasize the importance of completing your FAFSA form because it's your opportunity to receive grants, loans. You may want to even participate in a work study program. So it's really important for you to complete your FAFSA, and as soon as possible so that you can receive the maximum amount that you're entitled to. Are there any questions? Thank you all for participating today. I really enjoyed you. And I hope you have a great day, okay?

Brandon Hamlett Social Studies Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 

00:27:00
BRANDON HAMLETT I have a tracker in my room that people or the students put their picture next to if they have applied to a big scholarship or applied to reach schools. And as students start to see other students get excited about oh, I've applied to my reach school, or I heard from this school and I got accepted, uhm, it really kind of drives the energy of the group to, oh, I need to get on board. For example, we have one student who really, he just wasn't applying to schools and he, he is fully capable of going to college. And for one reason or another he wouldn't do it. And we had teachers talking to him. It wasn't until in advisory when students started getting accepted to their reach schools that he finally decided okay, I'll just do it. 

00:27:40
Carolynn 

00:27:40
CAROLYNN This year for seniors, we have like a tracking chart of everything that we need to get done to get into college. So you have like, how many scholarships, a minimum that you have to fill out and these applications need to get done. Like, you have a chart so you can kind of monitor yourself on what you have done and what you haven't done to get into college or for financial aid or whatever it is you need.

Virginia Jose Visual Arts Teacher, South Bronx Preparatory: A College Board School, NYC 

00:28:05
VIRGINIA JOSE There are certain basics that they, they have to know. Like I would say, you need to know what majors they offer. Where's this place located? Can you afford it? And you know what, if you can't afford it, what are ways in which we can plan so that you can afford it? 

00:28:20
UNKNOWN You know, she's always showing her support for us as students, always talking about college.

Mariah

MARIAH I like being able to have the uhm, like discussions about our futures and stuff in the, that kind of environment of advisory because you know, you can talk freely and you should be able to trust the people in your advisory, like be close with them and be able to open up like that.

MICHELE TISSIERE So one of the things I want to do today is to think about uhm, our aspirations. Does any-, has anybody ever heard that word before, aspirations? 

00:30:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:30:15
Michele Tissiere ESR Facilitator 

00:30:15
MICHELE TISSIERE No? Okay. Here's what I want you to do, because some of you have some knowledge around the word aspiration and some of you don't. I'm going to ask you to do a turn and talk right now with a partner. And here's what I mean, here's a partnership. Here's a partnership. Partnership. Alia (ph), yeah? Partnership. Partnership. You two. Two. Two. We're good to go. I want you to talk with your partner right now. What do you think this word, aspiration, means? What do you think it means to aspire to something? What might that mean? You've got about a minute to-, I'll time you, a minute to talk with your partner, okay? Words, words or phrases that come up. What's that word mean, aspirations? Talk with your partner, okay? 

00:31:00
UNKNOWN What you aspire to be? 

00:31:00
UNKNOWN That's when a youth has aspirations (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
UNKNOWN -That you want to do, so you keep going at it. 

00:31:05
BIANCA Something you actually want to do. 

00:31:10
DIVINE Yeah. 

00:31:10
BIANCA Instead of like, inspiration. 

00:31:10
DIVINE Yes, I agree with you. It's different from inspiration. 

00:31:15
MICHELE TISSIERE Something that you would invest in in your future, yeah? Lovely. Lots of interesting thinking going. I want to hear from different groups. Popcorn style. I'm going to actually chart some of the smart thinking that's going to go on here around what it means to have an aspiration, or to aspire. So what came up for you as far as what aspiration means? What do you think it means? 

00:31:35
UNKNOWN I got that aspiration means, it's like, another word for your career when you get out of high school and what you're going to do. 

00:31:40
MICHELE TISSIERE Okay, so it's looking at a career after high school. Thank you for that. Another one? Yeah? 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN Something that just drives you to do it, like if you want to go and do it, just go do it. 

00:31:55
MICHELE TISSIERE Yeah, it's a drive. It's a personal drive to do something. So when you talk about a personal drive, it's really an energy and a motivation to follow something you're really interested in. Is that right? Okay, another? Popcorn? Yeah, Mercedes? 

00:32:15
MERCEDES What inspires you or what you want to do with your life. 

00:32:20
MICHELE TISSIERE Yeah, and one more. Yes, Divine? 

00:32:20
DIVINE Something that you want to do and you stick through it, like a long term goal. 

00:32:25
MICHELE TISSIERE Okay, it's an important point that you raise. And so it's a, it's a desire that you have. You want to do this and you stick to it. You follow through on it. Okay. I'm going to put follow through up here, because that's a really important one, Divine. That was fantastic, you guys. We started out having you think about a career that interests you right now. We've talked about this word aspiration, something you want to do, something you're motivated to do, you feel passionate about, you follow through on. You're inspired. Okay? I want you to go back to your partner that you just had, your turn and talk partner. I'm going to give you a Post-it note, and I want you to think about one other career that interests you, because as ninth graders, you have lots of options ahead of you. So it's really good to be thinking flexibly about, you know, I might want to be an architectural engineer. I might want to be a cosmetologist. And I also have other choices. So right now, I want you to push yourself a little bit, be flexible in your thinking. What's another career where I think I've got some good skills that kind of interests me? I'll hand out Post-it notes. You're going to get some independent think time right now, quiet time to think about what is that other career for me?

And we don't really get enough of that during our day, so thank you for doing that. You have time with your turn and talk partner again to really share the career and share the reasons, some of the reasons why that's on your mind. And then we'll move into a larger group conversation. So I'm going to give you two minutes to do that. I want you to do one thing for me right now. Partner A, Partner B. Identify who's going to be Partner A, who's going to be Partner B. Right now, talk to your partner. You're either A or B. Here's your partner here. Where are my A's? Perfect.

Valerie Milburn Advisory Coordinator, Lanier HS, Austin 

00:35:15
VALERIE MILBURN No matter what the other factors are supporting a kid to go to college, whether it's parental involvement, or scores, or original desire to go to college. No matter what those factors are, the most important thing that is going to motivate a kid to go to college is the peer group. It's working with the peer group to develop those plans, to develop the idea from the beginning. And that's why we start in the ninth grade. 

00:35:40
MICHELE TISSIERE Tell me about your career. 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN "I want to be a cop." 

00:35:45
MICHELE TISSIERE You want to be a policeman? 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN "Because I want to make people feel safe. And I want to stop the crime that's around the city." 

00:35:55
MICHELE TISSIERE So it's important for you to have neighborhoods that feel safe and caring for people. Very nice. What were some of the careers that you're exploring? 

00:36:00
UNKNOWN Uhm, my second career choice was uhm, mechanical engineer because when I was little my dad used to work on cars and he would take me to his job all the time and I got kind of used to it. And I really started enjoying it. 

00:36:15
MICHELE TISSIERE So you had a real personal experience because Dad had an expertise in it. 

00:36:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:36:15
MICHELE TISSIERE And that peaked your interest a little bit. Perfect. 

00:36:20
Usbaldo 

00:36:20
USBALDO My advisor, uh, he knows what kind of uh, career I want to take after college and every time I walk into the class, he asks me if I, if I've been working to get that goal, my career after high school. 

00:36:35
MICHELE TISSIERE Just for fun, I want, you know how we started out today where we began with a career lineup? I want to move around and hear again the second interest that you had. I need a volunteer to start. Alia. Okay, Bianca, would you be willing to go after Alia? And then we're going to go this way. It's called a go-round, everybody in the room. And believe it or not I have one too. Because even though I'm 52, I still have other interests that I would like to pursue. Okay? So, Alia. 

00:37:05
ALIA I want to be a poet. 

00:37:05
MICHELE TISSIERE You want to be a poet. 

00:37:10
ALIA Yes. 

00:37:10
MICHELE TISSIERE Okay. Bianca? 

00:37:10
BIANCA Uh, I want to be a soccer player. 

00:37:10
MICHELE TISSIERE A professional soccer player. 

00:37:15

00:37:15

00:37:20
UNKNOWN A doctor. 

00:37:20

00:37:25
UNKNOWN A writer. 

00:37:25

00:37:25
MICHELE TISSIERE A veterinarian? 

00:37:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:37:25
MICHELE TISSIERE Okay. 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN A lawyer. 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN I want to be a policeman. 

00:37:30
MICHELE TISSIERE A policeman, okay. Uhm, we looked at aspirations, you know, something you want to do, something you're committed to, you have a passion about. I've heard two different careers for each of you today. I want to hear, I want to put out on the table now, what are some of the reasons why you've chosen these careers and let's talk about that with each other and start to have a conversation. You know, if you want to be an architectural engineer, what are some of the things you need to do now, in high school, to prepare for that kind of career choice? And we're going to push each other's thinking a little bit about that, okay? Who wants to, now I've heard so many different wonderful creative ideas around your aspirations and your career options. Who wants to kick us off? Yeah, Christy? 

00:38:10
CHRISTY Well, for my career for a clothing designer, I think I will have to learn a lot of math because of my points and my texture and everything. 

00:38:20
MICHELE TISSIERE Yeah. 

00:38:20
CHRISTY And uh, just be in art classes. 

00:38:20
MICHELE TISSIERE You recognize that the math is really going to be a critical skill for you to develop in order to be successful in the career. What other careers in here were chosen where math feels like it's going to be an important-. You talk more about that. Yeah. Ezra (ph), talk a little bit about why? 

00:38:35
EZRA Being a video game designer, uhm, you can make a lot of coordinates, putting out every coordinate, exactly. 

00:38:45
MICHELE TISSIERE Divine? 

00:38:45
DIVINE Uhm, I would like to be a news editorial writer which means I would have to be in journalism in high school for a while. And also be good in English because you're going to have to not only write articles in here but also abroad, describing the things that are there, both the culture, the economy, the government and everything else. So it's good to have good English in a way. 

00:39:05
MICHELE TISSIERE So Divine, it sounds like there are a couple of foundational skills. You're talking about your English skills being really critical to support you as a writer. You also brought in a cultural element, which would tie in to some of your history learning and really appreciating the different cultures. If you're going to travel as a journalist, you really have to have that sensitive eye and ear and really be listening in and learning. 

00:39:25
Kathy Ryan Principal, Lanier HS, Austin 

00:39:25
KATHY RYAN You know, the students have to know if that's a goal that they have, then they've got to be prepared for it from their freshman year, their sophomore year, their junior year and their senior year. And there's different things they can do along the way to be successful and make that happen. 

00:39:40
MICHELE TISSIERE We've talked about writing and math and having a cultural sensitivity, all right, to be successful in careers. I want to do a formal closing with you. I want you to think about a personal learning from today's session with each other. Uh, what you're walking away with, one learning. And I'll give you one model. One thing I learned from all of you today, that there is very diverse thinking around career choices and that you're flexible thinkers because you're coming up with two and lots of reasons why. It was a really key learning and important learning for me. You're doing a solo thought right now. What's a learning for you? You can write it down on paper, or you can anchor your thought up here. 

00:40:25
[sil.] 

00:40:35
MICHELE TISSIERE Okay, are we ready? This is called a whip. In this closing, it's called a whip, which means we're going to whip around fairly quickly, all right? So, we don't want a real long winded explanation or learning. We just want something quick. Quick reply. I need a volunteer. I'm going to do a go-around. Somebody? Divine? And Pedro? Could we go this way? Okay? 

00:41:00
DIVINE Uh, open mindedness. 

00:41:00
EZRA Inspiration. 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN Focus. 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN Uhm, I learned that it's good to have self-motivation. 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN Different ways to use my creativity. 

00:41:10
MICHELE TISSIERE Okay. 

00:41:10
UNKNOWN "I learned that never to give up, ever." 

00:41:15
UNKNOWN Uh, I learned that always use your imagination. 

00:41:20
UNKNOWN I learned to communicate. 

00:41:20
ALIA I learned that even though we all have different uhm, personalities, I learned that we have one thing in common, to think about the future. 

00:41:30
BIANCA I learned to think big. 

00:41:35
MICHELE TISSIERE I learned to think big. And that's the note we're going to end on today because we want you thinking big. And you did today in all kinds of ways, flexibly, creatively, okay? Really important. Okay, I wanted you to give each other a round of applause because this was- 

00:41:45
Kathy Ryan Principal, Lanier HS, Austin 

00:41:50
KATHY RYAN Any time kids get into a group where they're talking to each other, it's, it takes on a power that an adult couldn't recreate if they wanted to. You know, there's something about kids interacting with each other that makes things happen. 

00:42:00
Tanisha 

00:42:05
TANISHA Students get tired of hearing teachers say, Oh, go to college, go to college. It's really good for you. When you hear it from other people, like your age, and they're talking to you about it. And you can actually, you know, relate to them, it's so much better than just hearing it from any other adult. Because, you know, it sounds the same. But hearing it from students, it's like, it's really positive and it motivates you more. 

00:42:20
Jan Zajicek College Counselor, Lanier HS, Austin 

00:42:20
JAN ZAJICEK And that's what advisory does. It also helps students bond with one another and form relationships and, and, and, you know, you can tell that, because they'll come in and they'll ask questions. And you know that they've been talking to each other and to their advisory teacher. 

00:42:40
Bianca 

00:42:40
BIANCA When you have the trust, you know that there's people in the room that want you to do better. They want you to succeed in life. They want you to grow up and leave high school doing something, like having a career, like being successful. And it helps you because you have those people who share in, you're sharing something. You're sharing a bond.
