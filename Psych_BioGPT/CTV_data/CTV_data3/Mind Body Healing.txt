A SENSITIVE FAIL-SAFE APPROACH TO HYPNOSIS Ernest Rossi, Ph.D. 

00:01:10
HOST For most of us, hypnosis is really about healing, is it not? So I'd like to ask if there's anyone in the audience this afternoon who's really in a, an acute state of distress. Chronic distress. Fiscal, mental. Pain. Someone who's really got an issue that they feel they can do some effective work with this afternoon. So this is not merely a demonstration, this is the real thing. 

00:01:45

00:02:05
HOST Guess you have to sign here, (inaudible ).

JENNIFER Oopsy. (inaudible ) 

00:03:20
 Higher! 

00:03:20
 Higher! 

00:03:20
 Higher! 

00:03:20

00:03:20
 Higher! 

00:03:20
JENNIFER Higher, higher. 

00:03:25
[sil.] 

00:03:30
HOST I see your name is Jennifer? 

00:03:35
JENNIFER That's right. 

00:03:35
HOST How can you be helped, today? 

00:03:40
JENNIFER I have, uh, rheumatoid arthritis. And, today, I'm especially flared up from, I'm not sure exactly why. It might be the rain. Or it might be a cold that I've got. But, um, in general, I'm concerned just about the rheuma --, the rheumatoid, in general. 

00:04:00
HOST How long have you had this? 

00:04:00
JENNIFER About 10 years. 

00:04:05
HOST What kind of therapy have you had? 

00:04:05
JENNIFER Western medicine. Lots of medicine. Um, acupuncture. 

00:04:15
HOST You've had -- You've had thorough Western traditional medical work-ups? 

00:04:15
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:04:15
HOST And you're really diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis? 

00:04:20
JENNIFER Right. Yeah. And, um, I've learned over ten years that Western medicine only works with symptoms. And it hasn't really done anything for any kind of healing. That, that I'm certain of. So I tried acupunc --, I've tried a lot of different things. Um, but I've found it very difficult to, to penetrate. 

00:04:45
HOST So you've tried Western medicine, you've tried acupuncture. What else? 

00:04:50
JENNIFER Uh. Well, I was in Brazil one year, and I saw a number of healers. Um, an --, did some energy work there. And, um, there was some, some effect from that. Um. 

00:05:10
HOST On a scale of one to 100, where 100's the worst you've ever experienced your symptoms, Jennifer, what are you experiencing right now? 

00:05:25
JENNIFER About 75. 

00:05:25
HOST Very good. Okay. We've really got something to work with. 

00:05:30
JENNIFER Oh yeah. 

00:05:30
HOST All right. 

00:05:35
[sil.] 

00:05:40
HOST I notice your hands. 

00:05:40
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:05:45
HOST Can you -- 

00:05:45
JENNIFER That's where it shows the most. 

00:05:45
HOST Yes. Can you turn to the audience so that we can . . . Okay to share some of that? There's really some obvious distortion you can see in the joints of your fingers. 

00:06:00
JENNIFER Yeah. I've got a couple of tendons that are, um, ruptured, and a, and a couple of joints that, uh, that are swollen. And my hands are . . . I can get it all over my body, but my hands are the place that it usually is at most of the time. Or all the time. 

00:06:20
HOST I see. Most of the pain, or all the pain. 

00:06:20
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:06:20
HOST And this is where it's about 75% level in intensity right now? Or is it . . . 

00:06:30
JENNIFER Um. I also, um, feel it throughout my body. So it's, it's kind of an achiness. 

00:06:40
HOST Mm-hmm. 

00:06:40
JENNIFER So I'd say that 75% is both kind of a, a achy, fluish feeling. 

00:06:45
HOST Mm-hmm. 

00:06:45
JENNIFER And in my ha --, in my hands and feet. My feet get it too. 

00:06:50
HOST Okay, I like that. You began the description, an aching, fluidish feeling? 

00:06:55
JENNIFER Fluish. 

00:06:55
HOST Fluish. 

00:07:00
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:07:00
HOST Okay. 

00:07:00
JENNIFER Like, like, like it's, I have a virus or something. 

00:07:05
HOST Oh, I see. Like a flu. Uh-huh. Stay with it now, Jennifer, tell me just where you're experiencing it. Give me a little commentary on what you're exactly experiencing. 

00:07:15
JENNIFER Right now? 

00:07:20
HOST Yeah. 

00:07:20
JENNIFER Um. My shoulders, uh, ache. 

00:07:30
HOST Stay with that ache for a moment, Jennifer, and let's see what happens with it as you focus on it now. 

00:07:40
[sil.] 

00:08:05
HOST That's right. What are you experiencing now? 

00:08:10
JENNIFER Uh. At first I, I resisted feeling it, because I think lots of times I kinda separate, I kinda separate from my body so, so I don't feel it as much. And then for some reason I just started relaxing. 

00:08:25
HOST Uh-huh. And how about that discomfort in your shoulders. Is it getting better? Or worse? Or changing in any way? Or what? 

00:08:40
[sil.] 

00:08:50
JENNIFER Seems like it kind of spread out and got lighter. 

00:08:55
HOST Very good. Go with it now, Jennifer, go with the spreading out, getting lighter, and let's see what happens next. 

00:09:05
[sil.] 

00:09:20
HOST That's right, the courage to really go with it, Jennifer. And occasionally saying a few words, or a sentence, only what I need to hear to help you further. 

00:09:45
[sil.] 

00:10:05
HOST Mm-hmm. 

00:10:10
[sil.] 

00:10:35
HOST And is that going well? 

00:10:40
JENNIFER The words that come to me are I need to go deeper inside. 

00:10:45
HOST Okay. Let's let that happen. 

00:10:50
[sil.] 

00:11:15
HOST Is it easy for you to go deep inside right now? 

00:11:20
JENNIFER Pretty much. For one second I, I thought, I can't believe I'm doing this. 

00:11:30
HOST That's right. Stay with that. You can't believe you're doing this. 

00:11:35
JENNIFER And then I just kept doing it. 

00:11:40
HOST Yes. I notice from the pulsations in your neck that your heart's really beating quite rapidly. Can you feel that? 

00:11:50
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:11:50
HOST You're trying to go inside, but that quarrel(ph) ticker is . . . What would you say you're experiencing exactly now? 

00:12:05
[sil.] 

00:12:10
HOST You're trying to go inside, yet . . . 

00:12:15
[sil.] 

00:12:30
JENNIFER I feel like I'm, I'm inside, 'bout down to my waist. 

00:12:35
HOST Say that again? 

00:12:35
JENNIFER I feel like I'm inside, 'bout down to my waist. 

00:12:40
HOST Oh, right, you're inside about down to your waist. Like about halfway? 

00:12:45
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:12:50
[sil.] 

00:13:10
HOST And now? 

00:13:15
JENNIFER Farther. 

00:13:20
[sil.] 

00:13:25
JENNIFER I feel like I almost could lose track of where I am. 

00:13:30
HOST You could almost lose track of where you are. Uh-huh. I tell you what, Jennifer, continue what you're doing, but instead of trying to lose track, suppose you simply really turn in to what's happening within you. Really. Instead of trying to do something to yourself, associating, or whatever, why not just be an active recorder of really what's going on. 

00:14:05
[sil.] 

00:14:15
HOST For example, what number are you experiencing on the pain or discomfort or arthrit-- arthritis revolvement(ph) right now? 

00:14:30
[sil.] 

00:14:35
JENNIFER I think about 65. 

00:14:35
HOST 65? Do you think you could bring it back up to 70, 75? 

00:14:45
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:14:50
HOST Okay. Let's see you try that, Jennifer. Let's see if you can let it get worse. As a matter of fact, quite a bit worse, before it gets better. 

00:15:05
[sil.] 

00:15:15
HOST How about now? 

00:15:20
JENNIFER It's probably about 80. 

00:15:20
HOST 80. Very good, Jennifer, go for that now. Let's see if you can get it even worse than that. Just really go for it now, the courage just to really let yourself get into it. 

00:15:40
[sil.] 

00:15:50
HOST And tell me a little bit of the worst that you're experiencing as you're doing it. 

00:15:55
[sil.] 

00:16:00
JENNIFER Uh, my hands are really hot. 

00:16:00
HOST The hands are really hot. Fantastic, Jennifer. Do they often get hot like this? 

00:16:10
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:16:10
HOST Very good. Let them get even hotter. Let's see what that leads to. 

00:16:20
[sil.] 

00:16:25
HOST Are they getting hotter? 

00:16:25
JENNIFER They're starting to sweat. 

00:16:30
HOST Huh? 

00:16:30
JENNIFER They're starting to sweat, I think. 

00:16:30
HOST Oh, they're starting to sweat. That's excellent. Really let them sweat, let's see what kind of incredible discomfort can continue to develop there. 

00:16:45
[sil.] 

00:17:00
HOST Is it still getting worse, Jennifer? 

00:17:05
[sil.] 

00:17:30
HOST You're smiling a little bit, so I can't tell if it's getting worse, or if you're having fun, or what. 

00:17:35
JENNIFER My right hand is just doing some stuff. 

00:17:35
HOST Your right hand is doing some stuff? 

00:17:40
JENNIFER Yeah, my left one feels like lead, but my right one. That's why I'm smiling. 

00:17:45
HOST Oh, I see. Your left hand's like lead, but your right one is like . . . 

00:17:50
JENNIFER I don't know, I th -- I think it started shaking a little bit or something. 

00:17:55
HOST Yes, I see it now, it is showing little micro-movements. Thanks for pointing that out to me. Okay, let's see what continues to happen in both those hands. Even while you continue with the discomfort, huh? 

00:18:15
[sil.] 

00:18:20
HOST There you go, very fine, yes. Do those fingers typically move that way, Jennifer? 

00:18:25
JENNIFER I don't think so. 

00:18:30
HOST Very fine. As if they have a life of their own. Let's see how they continue to express themselves. 

00:18:45
[sil.] 

00:18:55
HOST Yes. My goodness. That's right. Really allowing that to continue. That's it. Very fine, those fingers lifting and kind of vibrating in a hesitant way. That's it. Very fine. Allowing that sensitivity -- very good, now it's like three or four of those fingers are lifting completely up. That's it. Yes, my goodness. I wonder if the whole hand's going to continue lifting. That's extraordinary sensitivity. Very fine. Very fine, Jennifer. Even while that hand continues, I can continue talking with you, Jennifer. My goodness. Do you often have a experience of hand levitation this way? 

00:19:50
JENNIFER I have never done it before. 

00:19:55
HOST Never done it before. Have you witnessed other people? 

00:19:55
JENNIFER That's why I was smiling. 

00:19:55
HOST Oh, that's why you're smiling. 

00:20:00
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:20:00
HOST Have you seen other demonstrations with hand levitation? 

00:20:05
JENNIFER Um. 

00:20:05
HOST That's it. Continuing that wonderful lifting. Yes. That's it. 

00:20:15
JENNIFER I just didn't expect this, cuz I don't think you said anything. 

00:20:20
HOST That's right, you didn't expect it because I did not say anything. And yet it's happening all by itself. And now as the hand lifts even more, there's an extraordinary sensitivity, wobbling, so I'm sure some people up close can see it now, right? Very good, Jennifer, just allowing that to happen all by itself. Because we know of course healing takes place by itself too, very often, does it not? 

00:20:50
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:20:50
HOST Yeah. Very fine. Really appreciating a little bit of a miracle happening, a hand going up even though I didn't say a word about it. That's it. Very fine. Yes. Very fine, Jennifer. Very, yes, yeah. Mm-hmm. That's right. Does it really seem to have a life of its own? 

00:21:35
JENNIFER Kind of. 

00:21:35
HOST Kinda. Yeah. 

00:21:35
JENNIFER It's going over to the side. 

00:21:40
HOST What's that? 

00:21:40
JENNIFER I think it's going over to the side. 

00:21:40
HOST Yes, it is going over to the side, that's why I mentioned it. Life of its own. I haven't said anything about its going off to the side, did I? I haven't been whispering any secrets to you, have I? That the audience hasn't heard? No, this hand really has a life of its own. I don't know if it has stories to tell us today. I don't know if it's pointing to something beyond itself. That's it. I really am not sure just how it's connected with feeling. 

00:22:25
JENNIFER Actually, I just thought of something. 

00:22:30
HOST You just thought of something? Uh-huh. Well, keep it private for a moment, Jennifer. And only after a moment or two, you can carefully consider whether you want to share that with the audience or continue to keep it private. That's it, lifting. That's right, lifting, it's bumping up against the edge of the chair, but that's not stopping it, its ascent, is it. Incredible. That's right. And I'm going to adjust this wire. I'm going to take it off your leg so we can release the-- that's it. There you go. Very fine, Jennifer. Is that hand really going up or are you conning us all? 

00:23:30
JENNIFER No, it's . . . It just feels better going up. 

00:23:40
HOST It just feels better going up? 

00:23:45
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:23:45
HOST Very fine. Yes, it's finding its own way of feeling better, isn't it? My goodness, it does seem to be taking a odd turn, doesn't it. 

00:24:05
[sil.] 

00:24:10
HOST And what are you actually experiencing that hand as it continues all by itself that way? 

00:24:20
[sil.] 

00:24:25
JENNIFER Just now, it started shaking a little bit. 

00:24:25
HOST Yeah, I noticed that. 

00:24:30
[sil.] 

00:24:40
HOST Yes. Mm-hmm. 

00:24:50
[sil.] 

00:24:55
HOST That's right. Are you doing that voluntarily, or is that . . . Really going up and down there for a moment by itself. 

00:25:05
JENNIFER I wasn't thinking about it. 

00:25:10
HOST What's that? 

00:25:10
JENNIFER I wasn't thinking about it. 

00:25:10
HOST Okay. Yes, my goodness, it really seems to be . . . My goodness. 

00:25:25
JENNIFER What I remembered was that this was the first hand in the first place that I got rheumatoid. 

00:25:30
HOST I see. This is what Jennifer remembered: this is the first hand, the first place, that she got rheumatoid. So that's a very good place to be in. That's where the body signals were coming, the first place that led to the arthritis, so let's see if we can get the message even clearer. I don't know if that's gonna come in the form of words, or memories. I don't know if it's gonna be in the form of emotions. What you're actually experiencing at the time that arthritis began. But I do know that something is really . . . 

00:26:25
[sil.] 

00:26:30
HOST Just continue receiving that privately within yourself, Jennifer. That's it, very fine. It's like there's a symphony of little movements in those fingers. Little pantomime of talk, of messages. That's it, just receiving that privately within yourself. Ah, my goodness. And you know that you say, verbally, to me anything I need to hear -- that's it -- however briefly, just enough to help you further. My goodness. Yes, it's like each finger's getting into an act of its own. 

00:27:35
[sil.] 

00:27:40
HOST Yes. Mm-hmm. That's right. That's it. And really continuing with the courage to receive that, Jennifer. That's right. Yes. That's right. Yes. Uh-huh. Yes. That's right. If -- My goodness. If fingers could speak. Yes. That's right, my goodness. Now the others are getting into the act, aren't they. So what are you feeling about that? 

00:28:55
JENNIFER It's kinda weird. 

00:28:55
HOST It's kind of weird, yes. It is weird. Weirdness is the best, Jennifer. Because if something's weird, it means it's something a little bit different, huh? 

00:29:05
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:29:05
HOST Something you're not really used to. 

00:29:10
JENNIFER Western medicine never did this. 

00:29:10
HOST What's that? 

00:29:15
JENNIFER Western medicine never did this. 

00:29:15
HOST No, Western medicine never did this. But we're making connections. Very fine. Let's see what it leads to next. My goodness. My goodness, those fingers seem to be . . . That's right. Very fine. Really experiencing exquisitely. Just what's happening in that hand. Mm-hmm. 

00:29:55
[sil.] 

00:30:00
HOST My goodness. Huh. 

00:30:10
[sil.] 

00:30:15
HOST That's right. 

00:30:20
[sil.] 

00:30:30
HOST Mm-hmm. Yes, Jennifer, yes. Uh-huh. That's right. That's, yes. Really . . . Can you experience what's happening there? Are you aware of how that hand is turning in such an interesting way? My goodness. I think there's something being said there. I don't know what, but . . . 

00:31:05
[sil.] 

00:31:10
HOST Yes. That's right. Yes, incredible. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. My goodness, it's really doing something I . . . 

00:31:35
[sil.] 

00:31:35
HOST And are you receiving something about what's happening there with those fingers? Especially one of them, the middle there, that's one of my, that's my favorite for some reason. I find myself focusing on it. What's it trying to tell us? 

00:32:05
[sil.] 

00:32:10
HOST I mean, don't point at me, I don't know what's . . . 

00:32:15
JENNIFER It feels like it's pointing. 

00:32:15
HOST It is pointing. What's it seem like it's pointing to? 

00:32:20
JENNIFER I don't know. 

00:32:20
HOST I don't know either. 

00:32:25
JENNIFER I guess it is you. I dunno. 

00:32:30
HOST Yes. Wow. Now it's doing a little dance all by itself, pointing up, isn't it. Yes. You know, I'm so curious, what's that feeling like? Is that, are you . . . 

00:32:40
JENNIFER I feel like I can't move my hand except for exactly where it is. 

00:32:50
HOST Uh-huh. You can't move your hand except for where it is. How interesting, cuz it's really . . . 

00:32:55
JENNIFER It's kinda locked there. 

00:32:55
HOST It's kind of locked there. 

00:32:55
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:32:55
HOST Uh-huh. 

00:33:00
JENNIFER Like I can't open it and I can't close it. 

00:33:00
HOST You can't open, you can't close it, but it's really doing both things. It's opening and closing. Have you ever experienced anything like this before? 

00:33:10
JENNIFER Huh-uh. 

00:33:15
HOST I wonder if you're curious to look at that hand and see what it's doing. Or would you rather just allow it to continue. 

00:33:25
HOST Weird, huh? 

00:33:30
JENNIFER Yeah. Weird. 

00:33:35
HOST Have you ever seen it doing anything like that? 

00:33:35
JENNIFER No. 

00:33:35
HOST Oh my goodness, those, I've never --. It really seems as if it's trying to stretch and open up more and more. Does it feel like that to you? 

00:33:50
JENNIFER Yeah. It feels like it, it got locked. It still feels locked, but it does feel like it's trying to stretch. 

00:33:55
HOST Yeah. Feels like it got locked, and it's still locked, but it's stretching. 

00:34:00
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:34:00
HOST Yeah. Now this other hand seems to be wanting to get into act. Is this more on a voluntary level or are these hand, this other hand moving by itself too? 

00:34:15
JENNIFER I wanted to see if my other hand was locked. 

00:34:15
HOST Oh. 

00:34:20
JENNIFER It's not. 

00:34:20
HOST It's not locked, is it, not locked. 

00:34:20
JENNIFER No. 

00:34:20
HOST Okay. By the way, what number would you say your state is in? It got up, what, 80, 80? 70? Where are you now? 

00:34:30
JENNIFER Well, the rest of my body feels, uh, better. My hand feels worse. 

00:34:35
HOST So the rest of your body's better, but your hand feels worse. That's wonderful. 

00:34:40
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:34:40
HOST Let's let it, all that misery flow into that hand. Lets all the worst be there. 

00:34:45
JENNIFER Ugh. 

00:34:45
HOST Because it seems to be -- I mean, I know you're . . . To me, it seems to be having fun, I'm sorry. 

00:34:50
JENNIFER Probably. 

00:34:55
HOST But you're saying it's not feeling comfortable in that hand as it's moving? 

00:35:00
JENNIFER Well, the movement feels good. The little movements. 

00:35:05
HOST Uh-huh. 

00:35:05
JENNIFER That does, it feels as was could be fun, or it just feels like, it feels good. 

00:35:10
HOST So the little movements feel good. That could be fun. 

00:35:15
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:35:15
HOST So what's not -- 

00:35:20
JENNIFER And the part that hurts is the, the locked part. It hurts on my wrist and it hurts on . . . 

00:35:25
HOST Oh, the wrist hurts. 

00:35:25
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:35:25
HOST I see. 

00:35:25
JENNIFER Or if I try to open it, or close it, it hurts. 

00:35:30
HOST I see. Trying too hard to open it makes it hurt. 

00:35:30
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:35:30
HOST But so long as it has little movements by itself it's okay? It's like fun? 

00:35:35
JENNIFER Well, the wrist still kinda hurts. 

00:35:40
HOST Huh? 

00:35:40
JENNIFER The wrist still hurts, kinda. 

00:35:40
HOST The wrist still hurts. 

00:35:45
JENNIFER With it holding like that. 

00:35:45
HOST All right. Okay, let's see what happens now. 

00:35:50
JENNIFER It was actually my wrist that first got it. 

00:35:50
HOST Oh, it was your wrist that first got it. 

00:35:55
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:35:55
HOST So it's the first to complain, and it's the last. It's going to give up, its complaint. Again, I really wonder what kinda . . . 

00:36:05
JENNIFER When I, when I looked at it, it looked kinda primitive, or something. 

00:36:10
HOST Yes, it did. That's exactly a wonderful word. Primitive. I've never thought of it, but it does seem to fit it. Primitive. So go with that Jennifer, really primitive. That's, that's it. Really primitive. Great. Really primitive. Are you curious to take another peek and see if it's even more primitive now? 

00:36:40
JENNIFER Yeah. Yeah. 

00:36:40
HOST It is more primitive. 

00:36:40
JENNIFER I don't like looking at it. 

00:36:45
HOST Yes. Good. Go with tha. . . 

00:36:55
[sil.] 

00:37:00
HOST And really the courage now, Jennifer, simply, do you see the primitiveness? 

00:37:10
[sil.] 

00:37:30
HOST And where is that taking you now, Jennifer? 

00:37:35
JENNIFER I don't know. 

00:37:40
HOST You really don't know. 

00:37:45
JENNIFER Well, for a minute, it brought me back to where I was when I first got it. But ... 

00:37:50
HOST Yes. For a minute it brought you back where you were when you first got it. So let's see if you can really go back there, when you first got it, and let's see if there's anything primitive? 

00:38:15
[sil.] 

00:38:20
HOST That's right, Jennifer, staying with that, when you first got it. That's it. Staying with that. All about that. And most of that can remain private within you, of course. That's it. Really privately within yourself. The whole complete experience. Everything that's going on. 

00:38:55
[sil.] 

00:39:00
HOST Yes, that's right, very good. Very good, yes. 

00:39:05
[sil.] 

00:39:10
HOST Mm-hmm. That's right. And now? 

00:39:20
[sil.] 

00:39:50
HOST Mm-hmm. 

00:39:55
[sil.] 

00:40:00
HOST That's right, that's enough to bring a smile to your face. I don't know if you're having a good time, though, or a tough time. 

00:40:10
JENNIFER Just kind of a relief to pull it back. It's just, I can hardly move it. 

00:40:15
HOST I see. It's a relief to pull it back? Yeah, go with that, go with that pulling back. Very good, very good. 

00:40:20
JENNIFER I mean, it's just, it's shocking. 

00:40:25
HOST It's shocking? 

00:40:25
JENNIFER It's shocking how I can't move it. 

00:40:25
HOST How you can't move it. 

00:40:30
JENNIFER I can, but it's so . . . 

00:40:30
HOST Yeah. Yeah, that wonderful contrast between what it's doing and what you can do and can't do. Just go with all those. Yeah, that's it. Oh my goodness, something new seems to be happening. Wow. Yes. Something new is beginning to happen. That's it. That's it. Really. That's fantastic. 

00:41:10
[sil.] 

00:41:20
HOST Mm. That's it. Wow. How's it feel to let it really do that? Yeah, like that, yeah. My goodness. 

00:41:35
JENNIFER I sure don't know what this is. 

00:41:45
HOST You sure don't know what this is? 

00:41:45
JENNIFER No. 

00:41:50
HOST Well, I'm starting to get some hints, but those are just my private fantasies, I suppose. But all I know is I sure am getting a charge out of this. Very good, that's it. Yeah. Very good. 

00:42:05
JENNIFER It feels like, um, when you hyperventilate and your hands get stiff from it. If anyone's done that, that's what it feels like. 

00:42:20
HOST Yeah. 

00:42:20
JENNIFER Feels like all this energy is locked up in my hand. 

00:42:20
HOST Yes. It's like when you hyperventilate and like you're, all the energy's locked up in that hand. That's what we're getting to, that energy, that's locked up there. 

00:42:35
JENNIFER Yeah. yeah. 

00:42:35
HOST Incredible, that's it. Really. Go ahead. Yes. Yes. That's it. Wonderful. Wow. By golly. 

00:42:50
JENNIFER Ah. My wrist is -- 

00:42:50
HOST Huh? 

00:42:50
JENNIFER My wrist is really stiff. 

00:42:50
HOST Yes, the wrist is stiff. Hell, it hasn't been moving in a while. My goodness, it's about time we had a little action here. 

00:43:05
[sil.] 

00:43:10
HOST Stiff a bit too long, I would say. My goodness. Yeah. Yes. How's that feel, when you do that. Yeah, how's that feel? Yeah, how does that feel? 

00:43:30
JENNIFER Feels a little more normal. 

00:43:30
HOST Huh? 

00:43:30
JENNIFER Feels a little more normal. 

00:43:30
HOST Feels a little more normal, right. Almost looks normal too. 

00:43:40
JENNIFER My wrist still hurts though. 

00:43:40
HOST It hurts though but it . . . Yeah, yes. Great, my goodness. Woah. All right. Fantastic-o. Yes, yes, gosh. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yes. Gosh. Do you really still wanna keep your eyes closed, or do you wanna watch some of this action, look at that. 

00:44:20
JENNIFER I'm embarrassed to watch it. 

00:44:25
HOST What, what's embarrassing about that? Yeah, what's what's embarrassing about that? Tell me. 

00:44:30
JENNIFER I'm not sure. 

00:44:30
HOST I mean, really, I really wanna know, what's embarrassing about it? 

00:44:35
JENNIFER It makes me more aware of what's going on here. 

00:44:40
HOST Yeah, what's going on here. 

00:44:45
JENNIFER Uh, a lot of people. 

00:44:45
HOST My gosh. Mm. Yeah. How's it feel when the hand actually closes like that? Is that a, what? 

00:44:55
JENNIFER How's it feel? Feels kinda good, it feels strong, actually. 

00:45:00
HOST Yes, it feels kinda good, it feels strong, actually. That's what I want you to continue exploring, Jennifer, that good feeling, that strong feeling. That's it. By golly. All right. Mm. Mm. 

00:45:25
[sil.] 

00:45:30
HOST Yes. Incredible. It still feel? Mm. All right. 

00:45:50
[sil.] 

00:45:55
HOST To hell with all that verbal therapy business, right? 

00:46:00
JENNIFER Right. 

00:46:00
HOST Let's have a l--, let's have a little real action here. My gosh. 

00:46:10
JENNIFER When I first, uh, got this, I put a plastic, uh, stretch thing around my wrist. And there was one person that was, um, uh, kinda in a power position over me a bit, had given me a lot of grief. 

00:46:30
HOST This guy in a power position over you has given you a lot of grief. 

00:46:30
JENNIFER It's a woman. Yeah, and asked to see it, and I remember I clenched up my wrist like that and I said, "You can see it." 

00:46:40
HOST Come a little closer. You can see it. 

00:46:45
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:46:45
HOST You can see it. 

00:46:50
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:46:50
HOST Oh boy. So this was the beginning of your so-called grief, this character, huh? 

00:46:55
JENNIFER It was a woman. 

00:46:55
HOST Huh? 

00:46:55
JENNIFER She was a woman. 

00:47:00
HOST It was a woman. 

00:47:00
JENNIFER Yeah, she was a character too. 

00:47:00
HOST She was a character. And to what degree did you knuckle on to her? 

00:47:10
JENNIFER Unfortunately, um, I was in a position where I couldn't say anything. And, um, was told to weather it for a while. 

00:47:20
HOST You couldn't say anything and you were told to just to weather it. 

00:47:25
JENNIFER Yeah. And I weathered it for about, I think a month before this happened. 

00:47:30
HOST You weathered it for a month, kept your mouth shut, before this happened. That's how long it took to develop this. A month of holding that stuff in and just weathering it. 

00:47:45
JENNIFER Yeah. Um. 

00:47:50
[sil.] 

00:48:00
JENNIFER I just thought of something, I can't, I forgot it right away. 

00:48:00
HOST What's that? 

00:48:00
JENNIFER I just thought of something but I forgot it right away. 

00:48:05
HOST Yeah. Well to hell with it, can't be that important. 

00:48:10
[sil.] 

00:48:15
HOST My goodness. 

00:48:20
JENNIFER Oh I know, it, it stopped the grief. 

00:48:20
HOST It stopped the -- 

00:48:20
JENNIFER That this person was giving me. That's the unfortunate part. 

00:48:25
HOST Really, you're saying . . . Well, let's hear what you're saying. When you got the symptom, it stopped the grief? 

00:48:30
JENNIFER This person started, stopped giving me trouble. 

00:48:30
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:48:40
HOST When it became obvious that you were, what, having a problem with your hand and stuff? 

00:48:40
JENNIFER Yeah. And especially when it got diagnosed. 

00:48:45
HOST Especially when it got diagnosed. Well that was big of her, wasn't it? 

00:48:55
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:48:55
HOST How 'bout that other hand? I notice it's getting, it's lifting, and it wants to get into the act, is that right? 

00:49:00
JENNIFER Oh. 

00:49:00
HOST Let's see, what's going on here, is this one feel like it's making a? That's it. How's this one feel now? Seems to be recovering faster. 

00:49:15
JENNIFER Yeah, this one was never as stiff. It's a little bit, it's stiff, actually. 

00:49:20
HOST Yeah. 

00:49:20
JENNIFER It is. 

00:49:20
HOST All right. My goodness. How long has been since you've really used your hands this way? 

00:49:30
JENNIFER I used to play piano. 

00:49:30
HOST Really? 

00:49:30
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:49:30
HOST How long since you've played piano? 

00:49:35
JENNIFER Mm, five years. 

00:49:40
HOST God. And I suppose there isn't a piano around here? What is the staff doing? All right. 

00:49:50
JENNIFER This feels good, yeah, feels like there's a lot of energy in both of 'em. 

00:49:55
HOST Yes, a lot of energy in both of 'em, go with the energy now. I mean, I really just want you to enjoy, have some delight in that energy. Yay. Go team go. Wow. Gosh. Boxing gloves. Staff! 

00:50:15
JENNIFER Oh, I had, I had boxing gloves. When I was a kid, my dad taught me how to box. 

00:50:20
HOST Really, your dad taught you how to box? 

00:50:20
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:50:25
HOST How was it? What was it like? 

00:50:25
JENNIFER Well, it was one way to, uh, deal with my brother. 

00:50:30
HOST All right. All right. All right. Would have been a hell of a good way of dealing with her too, wouldn't it? 

00:50:45
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:50:45
HOST Yes, yes, yes. 

00:50:50
[sil.] 

00:51:00
HOST This feels good. 

00:51:00
JENNIFER It does, yeah. 

00:51:05
HOST Yeah. Mm. Mm. 

00:51:10
JENNIFER Mm. I don't feel that pain in my back anymore. 

00:51:15
HOST You don't feel the pain in your back anymore, well. 

00:51:15
JENNIFER Hm-mm. That's surprising. 

00:51:20
HOST Not surprising at all. We're getting to the source in these hands, man. 

00:51:25
JENNIFER Yeah, I guess so. 

00:51:30
HOST My goodness. How long's it since you been able to work those fingers like that? 

00:51:40
JENNIFER I don't, I haven't. 

00:51:40
HOST What's that? 

00:51:40
JENNIFER I haven't even tried. 

00:51:40
HOST Haven't even tried, all right. 

00:51:50
[sil.] 

00:51:55
HOST But it hurts. Ooh! I'm doing it but it hurts. Does it hurt? 

00:52:05
JENNIFER Uh, in parts it hurts. In other parts it doesn't hurt at all. 

00:52:05
HOST All right. Other parts you feel the energy, the power, the strength? 

00:52:10
JENNIFER There's lots of energy, it's wonderful. 

00:52:10
HOST Lots of energy. All right. That's it. 

00:52:15
JENNIFER Yeah. I don't know how I ever did this. 

00:52:25
[sil.] 

00:52:30
HOST Tell me now, who would you like to box first? Who comes to you? 

00:52:35
JENNIFER In my life? 

00:52:35
HOST Yes, in your whole life. 

00:52:35
JENNIFER Well, I have to keep that quiet. 

00:52:40
HOST Okay, good, that's right. I want you to go through the whole list, privately, okay? 

00:52:45
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:52:45
HOST Don't tell me at all, don't tell anybody, don't ever tell anybody, just, bop. 

00:52:55
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:53:00
HOST Oh my gosh. 

00:53:05
JENNIFER Actually, you know, the only parts that hurt right now? 

00:53:05
HOST Yeah. 

00:53:05
JENNIFER I have two tendons that ruptured on these two fingers. 

00:53:10
HOST Yeah. 

00:53:10
JENNIFER Means they rupt -- they came off the, the joint one time. 

00:53:15
HOST Tendons came off the joint, yeah. 

00:53:15
JENNIFER So they have to be put back on the joint. But the rest of them. 

00:53:20
HOST Are okay. 

00:53:20
JENNIFER Don't hurt. 

00:53:25
HOST Okay. So we're gonna have to keep to working on those two little joints for a little while, yet. 

00:53:30
[sil.] 

00:53:35
JENNIFER Oh jeez. 

00:53:40
[sil.] 

00:53:45
HOST Dough, bread dough, anybody got -- staff! 

00:53:50
[sil.] 

00:53:55
JENNIFER Hm. 

00:54:00
[sil.] 

00:54:05
HOST Hm. 

00:54:05
HOST All right. 

00:54:05
JENNIFER Feels like, feels like I should do this all night. 

00:54:10
HOST Feels like you should do this all night? 

00:54:10
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:54:10
HOST Yeah. 

00:54:15
JENNIFER Maybe not up here, but . . . 

00:54:20
HOST All right. 

00:54:20
JENNIFER On like a Friday night. 

00:54:25
[sil.] 

00:54:30
HOST My goodness. I've never stretched my fingers like this. 

00:54:35
[sil.] 

00:54:45
HOST Gosh. 

00:54:50
[sil.] 

00:55:00
HOST Oh, Jennifer, I'm looking at my clock. How long do you think we've been doing this? 

00:55:05
[sil.] 

00:55:10
JENNIFER I'm not a good person to ask that. 

00:55:15
[sil.] 

00:55:20
HOST What you're doing with this. That's what I was afraid of, she was gonna come -- 

00:55:25
JENNIFER How long have we been doing this? 

00:55:30
HOST How long does it seem, just subjectively, just take a guess? 

00:55:35
[sil.] 

00:55:40
JENNIFER 20, 25 minutes? 

00:55:40
HOST 20, 25 minutes? Actually, it's been, you know, almost an hour. 

00:55:50
JENNIFER Oh jeez. 

00:55:50
HOST But to hell with time distortion. We're not demonstrating any fake hypnotic phenomena, we're going for the real thing here. 

00:55:55
JENNIFER Right. Right. 

00:56:00
HOST So how will you continue this, Jennifer? 

00:56:05
JENNIFER Well, keep moving my hands. 

00:56:10
HOST Keep moving your hands, yeah. That's for starters for sure. 

00:56:15
JENNIFER Any other suggestions? 

00:56:15
HOST Yes. Who you gonna bop? 

00:56:20
JENNIFER I can do that pretty easily. 

00:56:20
HOST I mean, do you see what this is all about? Do you believe? I mean, we haven't talk about psychodynamics but I guess you're getting it, right? 

00:56:30
JENNIFER Yeah, yeah. 

00:56:30
HOST It was a month after you were pent(ph) of grief with this woman, you couldn't say anything, so your poor hands began speaking for you. 

00:56:35
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:56:40
HOST And then it -- profound aspect of fate, then she eases up on you, so it's like another positive reinforcement. 

00:56:45
JENNIFER Right. 

00:56:45
HOST It's like your mind-body has a kind of a genus, it found just the kind of thing that would get her off your back, only, you know, at the price of crippling yourself. 

00:56:55
JENNIFER That's right. 

00:57:00
HOST Does that make sense in terms of what you know about yourself? That you tend to, you know, hurt yourself rather than . . . 

00:57:05
JENNIFER Yeah. There's one other piece to this too. I was going with somebody at the time who after I got the arthritis, made more of a commitment to me. 

00:57:15
HOST Oh my god, a doubleheader. 

00:57:15
JENNIFER And, I didn't know it. I didn't know it, but his mother has died from rheumatic heart fev--, heart fever? 

00:57:25
HOST Maybe. 

00:57:25
JENNIFER Anyway, one of the symptoms of that is arthritis in your ankles. 

00:57:30
HOST I see. 

00:57:30
JENNIFER And so he had tapped into me wobbling around on my ankles. 

00:57:35
HOST I see. 

00:57:35
JENNIFER That it just got, uh. 

00:57:35
HOST Couldn't stop loving his mother. 

00:57:40
JENNIFER That's right. He finally had to. 

00:57:40
HOST He had to. Okay, so we don't have any of those things in the past hanging on, you're really free to continue unlocking yourself, literally. Getting your energy out. Do you know how you're going to be getting your energy out in your life? How you're gonna continue to expand your energy, your power? 

00:58:05
JENNIFER This moment? 

00:58:05
HOST Yes, well, I guess it's kinda short, but do you get the idea that this is what you need to do? This is what you're all about? Does that make sense? 

00:58:15
JENNIFER Sure. 

00:58:15
HOST So I'm not telling you anything new. You know you need to get out there, find create channels for your energy, find your power and stuff? Enough with being locked in, right? I mean, that's tragic. 

00:58:25
JENNIFER I knew it, but I haven't been told it quite so directly, so that helps. 

00:58:30
HOST Yes. But you knew it, that's right. So I'm just telling you what you already knew, but no one's ever told you this directly. Like, to hell with being nice, sweet, crippled Jennifer. All right? 

00:58:45
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:58:45
HOST I mean I, you know, you have such a beautiful smile, face, who wouldn't have compassion for you, right? It's easy to get compassion, love, being in the victim role, I mean. 

00:59:00
JENNIFER Yeah, I don't like it much. 

00:59:00
HOST I know, you don't like it much. And it's really an affront to anyone's dignity. 

00:59:05
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:59:05
HOST You don't need that role anymore. Okay, so she's giving me the high sign of one minute. Anything you'd like to say in this last minute to kinda solidify this. My goodness. How does that look to the audience? How does that look?
