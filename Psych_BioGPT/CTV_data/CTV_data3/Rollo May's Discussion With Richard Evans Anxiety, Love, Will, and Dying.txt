NOTABLE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONALITY Series PCR: Films and Video in the Behavioral Sciences Penn State Audio-Visual Services University Park, PA 16802 ROLLO MAY'S DISCUSSION WITH RICHARD EVANS: ANXIETY, LOVE, WILL, DYING EXISTENTIAL ANXIETY DEPRESSION AND DYING LOVE AND WILL RESPONSIBILITY 

00:00:25
RICHARD EVANS Rollo May received Ph.D. in psychology at Colombia University in 1949. After receiving training in Psychoanalysis in Vienna he become a supervisory training analyst at the William Alanson White Institute in New York City. He has held many distinguish academic poses. In addition to formal theological training he had extensive contact with a late Paul Tillich who set provocative books as Love and Will and The Meaning of Anxiety. He soon became a Leader in the American existential and humanistic movements. After many years of residence in New York City he currently in Tiburon, California where he continues his writing and the practice of psychotherapy. We were please to complete this discussion with Dr. May in his home in Tiburon. 

00:01:15
RICHARD EVANS Ah, what are the constructs for which you will become perhaps best know is existential anxiety. Dr. May, what exactly do you mean by existential anxiety? 

00:01:30
DR. ROLLO MAY Well, po-- probably the best way is if I begin with this study I made at the end of the previous book on anxiety, Meaning of Anxiety. Ah, unmarried mothers in New York City, ah, worked on the assumption which was a good, ah, psychoanalytic theory and the good academic of psychological, psychological theory. That the, ah, girl will be most anxious who has been most rejected by her parents. That's the development from Freud's theory. But I found out this wasn't true at all. It was true only with the middle class girls but with the proletarian girls, ah, they were often completely rejected by their parents, kicked out at the house everyday. But they knew it, it was no-- parents didn't lie about it or as the middle class parents had always lied. Now from that I would, ah, make a definition: that anxiety comes from being unable to orient yourself in your world. A world, I don't mean physical world, I mean psychological world. Anxiety comes because of my inability to know where I stand with you, ah, to communicate with you this is related to Solomon's idea that anxiety, like schizophrenia, it has a, a the result of failure and ability to communicate with other human beings. This is why anxiety is so close to alienation. When you're an a-- when you're alienated in our culture you are in that sense a anxious. Now, I think this is a much better theory of anxiety. This is the existential theory, the existentialist would include it to be, ah, to include the anxiety about death. Ah, anxiety about death is the ultimate in lack of communication is the ult-- is extension. It's when you are have gi-- are giving up your life entirely. You have no idea what lies beyond death. Uhm, now that is a, ah, an illustration of the ultimate of my theory of anxiety. The existential philosophers and the psychiatrist, psychologist who would say that anxiety is being threatened by non-being. That's the way Paul Tillich puts it. And that's another way of saying the same thing and that, ah, while I am being at me-- uhm, ah, I am living. Uhm, when non-being threatens me like sickness, illness, ah, ah, and ability to work, ah, hostility, all these things are non-being. Ah, ultimately they're going to win when I die. And, ah, this then is the ultimate sample of existential anxiety. I think all of these things, these apparent approaches anxiety fit in together and they give me the definition of which I would call existential anxiety. 

00:04:50
RICHARD EVANS Well, has it-- as you know today there has been an increased interest to the whole problem of death and dying and obviously the dying individual in terms of non-being would be in a state of, ah, ah, heightened existential anxiety as you just defined it. Ah, can we learn, ah, something more about the general nature of existential anxiety by particularly studying the, ah, terminal patient? 

00:05:15
DR. ROLLO MAY You and I are now in terminable. Ah, we are not going to die in the foreseeable future that is so far as you know so far as I know. But someday we're going to be, we'll be in the situation of termination of our existence. Uhm, and the prospect the, ah, imagination of this future moment of death, ah, spreads out over our whole life. And that's what gives our life zest. It's as if I'm, if I'm going to die sometime in the future, I don't know when but sometime, then I'd better be honest with you today. Life is, ah, as we may say it life is too short to try to lie once we're through it or to try to cover up what one really feels. So that the fact of ultimate death, ah, cast a, a sense of zest, a sense of, of, ah, activity of power, of enthusiasm over the light that I do live. Now we have this day. With had bit-- better experience and we have better, ah, know the Sun. We better, ah, have whatever intense experience as we can have because someday we will die. Ah, this all an example of how the fact of terminal illness is and, and, ah, ah, death does, ah, ah, make a contribution to the effectiveness of our living. 

00:06:50
RICHARD EVANS As you know, ah, Elisabeth Kübler-Ross who's studying the dying patient has tried to determine and describe some of the stages of, ah, how an individual reacts when faced with a thermal illness and very central to her observations is the concept to denial. I noticed that your discussion of existential anxiety you also talk about denial and, ah, how would you square away, ah, her concept of denial or the way denial is used this way with the way you would, ah, employ the construct, denial with respect to existential anxiety in your own way? 

00:07:30
DR. ROLLO MAY The denial of the fact that, ah, death this just around the corner for any of us is a way of making life superficial. It takes the away the sense of profundity of the-- of importance. See I have tuberculosis for some 10 years, uhm, and, ah, and during most of that period I had a hole in my lung about the size of a nickel and a cyst to begin with. And the doctor simply, ah, ah, could only say, ah, there's a 50/50 chance you will live and 50/50 you will die. And all I have month after month was the x-ray that would be taken. This is before they were any drugs for tuberculosis. I would simply lie in my bed and look up at the ceiling and wait for the, ah, x-ray that would come next month to show whether this hole has gotten larger or smaller. Now, this, ah, is, uhm, certainly existential anxiety with a vengeance. I discovered some people in this, ah, tuberculosis sanatorium chose to deny. They always remain happy, buoyant, ah, walked around and did things that, ah, perhaps, ah, well they-- well though they would, ah, ah, live as happily as they could. Death was never to be thought of. Now, the strange thing was a larger proportion of those people died then a people like me who felt their anxiety, ah, very much all the time. It's not a constructive thing to deny anxiety or to deny death you have to certainly deny the excessive forms of it which is neurotic anxiety. That you certainly should do your best to get over or neurotic fear of death. But, uhm, ah, the, the denial of the reality I think goes counter to the, ah, experience that we all have of, ah, wanting to live. 

00:09:40
RICHARD EVANS As you know one of the most, ah, visible movements, ah, in the media today is, ah, communicating to us, ah, some of the, ah, information concerning risk factors say in heart disease, cancer and so on. And, ah, in a way you might as well say that, ah, all this, ah, mass communication of information concerning how to prevent disease and death would become a vehicle in triggering off a certain amount of existential anxiety. How do you feel about this? 

00:10:20
DR. ROLLO MAY Yeah, I think we talk too much about it. Ah, I'm not at all sure that one wants to pre-- prevent death. If somebody wants to commit suicide he has the right to based on my judgment. Uhm, this-- are essential in the existential point of view. I'm not in favor of this tremendous campaigns to get people to stop smoking. Uhm, the-- or to, ah, prevent heart attacks. Certainly you should tell people but they won't, ah, stop smoking or treat their hearts better off with none. Purely on the basis of having it explain to them. There are other motives that are much more important. Some people may think, "What I would be-- I chose to enjoy life for 60 years, ah, with my smoking." Then to live, live to be 65 without enjoying life." Uhm, we have the strange idea in America, that all you have to do is educate people and tell them what's right or wrong. Ah, that then they'll go ahead and do it. Well this is phooey. And now, apparently the people have put out cars know the pedestrian cuz they won't let the car start until you put on your seat belt. 

00:11:40
RICHARD EVANS Yeah. 

00:11:45
DR. ROLLO MAY Now I, I think this is who we also because after all somebody wants to commit suicide or why should you have the right to? We, we don't want to legislate. No, no we can never legislate, people cannot die. You know, ah, I would do some-- prove anything certainly. I would make whatever research knowledge is available, ah, whatever the research odds we have I would make that available to people who, who help them to, ah, deal with their cholesterol decently. Ah, or their hearts or their lungs but I think our American idea of, ah, shoving it down everybody's throat is not a good idea. I think it is counterproductive also. 

00:12:35
RICHARD EVANS Well it's very interesting Dr. May in the state that we are doing which, ah, deals with preventing children from beginning to smoke we have indeed found that simply believing that smoking is dangerous does not stop a certain percentage of children from beginning to smoke as soon as they, ah, reached the seventh grade and, ah, are influence by such things as peer pressure, media pressure and the influence of modeling by smoking parents. 

00:13:10
DR. ROLLO MAY Modus for information or modus for behavior are different, are far deeper than simply what you consciously know. 

00:13:20
RICHARD EVANS Well Dr. May, one of the interesting things that we might observe is that whereas perhaps, ah, 20, 25 years ago we were focusing very heavily on such things as existential anxiety, in fact, in anxiety in general as a source of human problems. And now in recent years we seem to be more concerned whether you're aware of, of depression as a serious pervasive of human problems. Do that make any sense to you that we might evolve from anxiety to depression as an area of have an , ah, disturbance? 

00:14:00
DR. ROLLO MAY Although it make sense that's inevitable. Depression is the end result when you cannot face your anxiety. Ah, the anxiety was the central problem as you rightly said and said of 1940s. But, uhm, that this was followed by the 1950s the age of anxiety we all then consciously felt anxiety about the atom bomb, about over population, pollution, ah, impression, unemployment, everything. And I think the American people when they elected Nixon the second time I think they were boarding on the basis of a repressed anxiety, not wanting to upset the apple cart. And so they voted in guy that turns out to be a crook. Now, uhm, then we found that there was very little about this, ah, causes of anxiety that we could correct. Atomic control surely but we don't seem to make much progress on that. Sure they control the pollution, we do our best, we make some progress on that not terribly much. We discover that we simply had to live with this anxiety. There's no, there's no simple solution. You elect the other political party maybe a little bit better on. Just fundamental problems of unemployment and, ah, so on I'm still there. Now for many people then that meant depression. Ah, Silvano Arieti, uhm, my psychiatric colleague of mine in New York City wrote a very interesting article he called from anxiety to depression, uhm, to schizophrenia. And, uhm, in this he points out when anxiety cannot be met over a period of time there is as I had just said, ah, certainly, ah, would agree with there is a, ah, it is supplying it by depression. People in are just dis-- discouraged. Ah, they no longer have to "fight." And the, and that leads in, ah, very severe cases to schizophrenia. That's all, it's the, ah, apathetic aspect of schizophrenia. You see there's both an anxious aspect and apathetic and the-- ah, well the anxiety is going on. You still are fighting and you hope to be able to make some communication. When the depression sets in, ah, there's apathy and you give up. And most of the patient in our state middle hospitals are in the apathetic stage. Now what I hope is, ah, that our culture will not become apathetic. That we will continue working to change these things as best we can but we will also realize that all cultures go through these periods of dissolution and the fact that ours is now in that process but not to destroyed our hope for a renaissance even though that may occur after you and I die. There's still is a possibility of a new society being born. Ah, characterized, say by wind separation by, uhm, greater creativity, by last, ah, emphasis on technology and so on and so forth. A new renaissance, this is the, ah, what I live in, in the light of the-- I live in the light of these symbols that I think will be part of a new renaissance in 20, 30, 40 years. 

00:17:55
RICHARD EVANS Of course one of your major contributions Dr. May is your book entitled Love and Will which appeared in 1969. Ah, briefly what were you attempting to communicate in that book? 

00:18:10
DR. ROLLO MAY Well, it was first that love had been grossly misunderstood. It had been interpreted as sex. Love and sex had been identified and that really what love was, was quite beyond sex. Love was intimacy, love was one, ah, love was, uhm, was caring about the development of the other person. Uhm, now I just got a phone call this morning and I got several letters last week from, ah, the Rockefeller Foundation which is putting on a c-- ah, a conference for television writers on the intimate side of love. And we want to get across, uhm, to this TV writers that, uhm, love is intimacy, is understand, is, is richness of, authentic relationship. And sex certainly is an important part of it but sex is no substitute for it. Now, I think in this sense love and will has become, ah, ah, a true prediction and, ah, I think it is now part and parcel of our culture. As far as will goes, when I wrote the will outside of that book I was writing against a large number of, of the psychological and psychiatric professions. We didn't believe wi-- will. We thought will is nonsense. What I did in that book was to relate will to wish. I think first you begin to have visions and fantasies of what you later then make a decision about and this is what I called intentionality. And I think there's a study development from a wish, even unconscious wish through intentionality to decision. So I think this is also, ah, become true in a broad sense in our society. 

00:20:20
RICHARD EVANS In your book Love and Will in addition to dealing with intentionality you also dealt with the concept of courage, uhm, could you expand a little bit on how you, ah, we're talking about courage? 

00:20:35
DR. ROLLO MAY Well, I was using and certainly now and it's been in physical courage, uhm, has meaning more than also moral courage. I was using it as the courage to face your existential anxiety. The courage to die, which is something each of us has to do alone. The courage to, ah, be like Sisyphus who had to roll his, ah, rock up to mountain and then as soon as he got to the top every time he knew it was going to simply roll down again. The courage to face meaningless words even, ah, ah, we people who are professors realize that occasionally when we have, uhm, teaching to do, we have no inspiration for it at all very much like Sisyphus, rolling his rock up and certainly the students will feel that this-- that often they are in the position of Sisyphus. Now, where did you get courage to do that? It doesn't have to do with fighting, doesn't have to do with, with a moral decision although it's another way of perhaps moral decision. Has to deal with the courage to live and that's what Tillich meant by the courage to be. Now, I take it from the psychological point of view, Tillich took it from philosophical-- theological point of view. I think that courage, ah, is essential thing in, ah, all of our psychological, uhm, uhm, researchers or ought to be at least. I think it's a great pity that, that's left out of this predictions you we're talking about a little while ago. We did-- we act as though it's a purely moral problem and not psychological. To me a person cannot live psychologically with any kind of enthusiasm unless he has courage. 

00:22:25
RICHARD EVANS Still another important concept that you discussed in your book Love and, ah, Will was the concept of vitality. Of course, we all realize in all of these concepts interrelate it but would you like to, ah, discuss your concept of vitality a bit. 

00:22:45
DR. ROLLO MAY Well, I don't think I can much except to, ah, to say what would be s-- ah, known to you and to all of, ah, people who may see this film. Uhm, I think vitality increases, uhm-- well, let's say first how it decreases. It decreases with depression. Vitality decreases with empathy, it decreases when you have no hope. Uhm, all of these ways are-- mean that you cut off part of your life and this has nothing to do necessarily with anything physical. Uhm, vi-- vitality increases with courage, with hope when you can do something, when you can fight. Let's say like England in the last war without the worrying all the time about the fact that you were, ah, 10 times smaller than you opponent than Hitler uhm, but you still can go ahead. This kind of bulldog courage, ah, is, ah, ah, produces great vitality, great energy. Uhm, now hope also produces, ah, new vitality. And all of these things work together, I think one should be hopeful even though we live in an age that is in itself mostly hopeless. I made you to die and know that you and I and anybody else who wants to get on the boat can, ah, become, ah, it can gain a help out of realizing that something new maybe born out of our dying society and we can live in terms of those new symbols and, uhm, mess and beliefs. 

00:24:40
RICHARD EVANS Still another, ah, very intriguing and important concept in your book Love and Will was that of responsibility, ah, would you mind discussing responsibility? 

00:24:55
DR. ROLLO MAY Responsibility is a sense of term in psychotherapy. I said earlier that, I emphasize in psychotherapy the, ah, small margin of freedom that the individual patient has when he comes to my office. He had the freedom to put one foot in front of another to walk through my door. Uhm, and, uhm, this is a responsibility that is an illustration of what everybody has. You see no matter how much the patient may say, "I'm completely conditioned, I have no responsibility at all." He turns his heads around and he looks at me to say that and he looks at me. Now he is then responsible for the fact that he looked at me or that he can walk to my office or that he gets himself to that chair. Ah, and whether or not he says and you're been doing the-- he may say, "Oh, I'm so hopeless I don't have any, ah, freedom at all and I cannot say anything." But at least he could say. Now, what's important is to help the patient take responsibility for each of these things he does do. Even though that is simple as walking in through my door. And this then can be built upon. now in order to discharge this responsibility to feel that my own, ah, possibilities are increased that I can do more than I thought I could, uhm, that, that I'm meaning he, the patient, has more power than he thought. Ah, we must also understand his past, we must understand when he had to block off this particular form of behavior as you said earlier. So, the person is so afraid of meeting a new people. Uhm, ah, that will add to his responsibility. Ah, Spinoza once said "freedom is the awareness of determinism." And this is very true and that the more we are aware of our determinism that we're going to die after about 80 years. That we're going to, uhm, ah, that the winner will be colder than the summer. Ah, that we have to take it-- we have to be on time if we're gonna catch any airplane. All these things are, are partially determined. The more we can be aware of our determinism the more, ah, we will store up wood for the winter or the more we will live abundantly, uhm, knowing that we're going to die. Now, if you do know about your past you then are more able, uhm, to take effective responsibility. And in this way utilize your freedom then, ah, if you don't know about it.
