Psychoeducation Group Demonstration: A Career Development Group for International Students Dr. F.Robert Wilson Robert K. Conyne University of Cincinnati Counseling Program 

00:00:25
ROBERT K. CONYNE Hi! I'm Bob Conyne. 

00:00:30
F.ROBERT WILSON And I'm Bob Wilson. 

00:00:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE And we are both professors of counseling at the University of Cincinnati. We wanna welcome you to viewing the, ah, training tape called Psychoeducational Demonstration Group, a career development group for international students. 

00:00:40
F.ROBERT WILSON We prepared this tape because we believe there's a real training need. Psychoeducational groups are common place in education, mental health, but all too many times, they're really just not very well done. The group leaders get so invested in presenting content that they forget about the process of their group, how the members are getting along, what they're learning. Over the course of this tape, we'll move through the major steps that were outlined by the Association for Specialists in Group Work Document for Best Practice Guidelines. And those steps are planning, performing, and processing. 

00:01:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE And so in this tape, brief excerpts will be presented that show the leaders planning their group, ah, performing the leadership functions throughout the course of the group, and then processing the group and evaluating its, ah, events and experiences and outcomes. From time to time, we'll take turns also, ah, presenting brief lecturettes that are intended to set the stage for various, ah, aspects, ah, to follow, as well as to highlight to those things that we think you should give most attention to. 

00:01:50
F.ROBERT WILSON Psychoeducation groups are one of the four types of groups that have been defined by the Association for Specialists in Group Work through its professional training standards. The other three types are task for work groups, counseling groups, and psychotherapy groups. Psychoeducation groups are defined by the professional training standards as groups that seek to use the group medium to educate group participants who are presently unaffected about a potential threat such as AIDS, a developmental life event such as transition from school to work, or how to cope with an immediate life crisis such as the suicide of a loved one with the goal of preventing an array of educational or psychological disturbances and to keep them from occurring. 

00:02:35
Characteristics of Pschoeducation Groups ✓Brief time limits ✓Member homogeneity ✓Clear focus ✓ Accelerated cohesion ✓Here-and-now orientation ✓Active leadership 

00:02:40
F.ROBERT WILSON Psychoeducation groups are characterized by brief time limits, member homogeneity, clear focus, accelerated cohesion, here-and now-orientation, and active leadership. 

00:03:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE Psychoeducational groups are very flexible in their use. They can be used for a variety of purposes in different kinds of groups: consciousness raising, parent education ah, grief recovery, disease prevention, life planning, and career development to name just a few. 

00:03:15
Developing a Psychoeducation Group ✓Planning ✓Performing ✓Processing 

00:03:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE Over the course of this video, we'll follow a counselor as she plans a career development psychoeducation group, performs the psychoeducation group for which she has prepared, and processes the group. To ensure the quality of her psychoeducational group offering, she will attend closely to the guidelines for planning, performing, and processing as contained in the ASGW statement of best practices for group workers. So, let's begin the story of the psychoeducation group by focusing on planning. 

00:03:55
Planning ✓ picking the population ✓selecting the co-leader ✓preparing the plan ✓gathering resources ✓recruiting members 

00:04:00
F.ROBERT WILSON The first step identified in the ASGW Best Practices for Group Workers is, of course, planning. Planning a group involves several steps: picking the population, selecting the co-leader, preparing the plan, gathering resources, and recruiting members. On planning a psychoeducation group, one has to start somewhere, and the best place to start is by picking the population. There are two basic models, the theme-driven model and the population-driven model. In the theme-driven model, the group worker would start by picking a topic, for example, time management. And after reading the relevant literature, the leader creates a group plan for the curriculum for a generic time management psychoeducation group. Then the group worker attempts to attract participants for the group that he or she is designed. On the other hand, in the population-driven model, the group worker will start by identifying the population to be served and identifying their needs. When the group worker is clear what the most pressing needs of the population to be served are, then the group worker designs a psychoeducation group to meet those needs. Watch as the counselor is charged by her employer to develop a group to address the career concerns of international students studying here in the United States.

00:05:35
KATHLEEN ADDISON Good morning, Shirin! Thank you for coming. Have a seat. 

00:05:35
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Could I have a seat? 

00:05:40
KATHLEEN ADDISON Sure. We got a call from the office of International Student Affairs. They want us to set up a career development group, ah, for their students, for the international students., uhm, apparently, they tried to do something like this a couple of years ago - 

00:05:55
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh hmm. 

00:05:55
KATHLEEN ADDISON - but it fizzled because they couldn't get student participation. Nobody signed up. So if we agree to do this, I think we have to plan this very carefully so that we'll assure that, that we get student participation, uhm, the International Student office wants the best service for their students, uhm, and I think they want to avoid another fizzle. Do you think this is something you might be interested in? 

00:06:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Well, you know I'm interested in career development and I've ran several career development groups for American undergraduate students, never anything with an international focus, although it would be something I'd be interested in. When are you hoping the group will run? 

00:06:35
KATHLEEN ADDISON Well, I think probably the beginning of next semester would be soon enough. I, I think it might be rushing it a little bit to get it, to try to get it off the ground this semester, uhm, could you check your calendar and, and get back to me, uhm, maybe by the end of the week? 

00:06:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Sure. I can do that. 

00:06:50
KATHLEEN ADDISON Oh! That's great. 

00:06:55

00:06:55
Advantages of Co-Leadership ✓sharing resources and responsibilities ✓having someone to "watch your back" ✓modeling cooperative relations ✓collaborative processing between group sessions 

00:07:00
F.ROBERT WILSON Although psychoeducational groups can be led solo, their distinct advantage is to leading with another capable person. This is called co-leadership. Attractions of co-leadership include the following: Co-leadership allows responsibilities to be shared in some equitable and agreed upon manner. Co-leaders can also learn from each other and share personal resources with one another. Because groups are quite complicated with a lot going on at the same time, it's frequently too challenging for one leader to effectively monitor everything while being able to select interventions that are on target. With another leader present, each can watch the other's back. For example, one leader can introduce the topic while the other leader observes the group process. Co-leaders can serve as models for members, demonstrating how two people in like roles can cooperate and collaborate as they work together. Co-leadership provides a built-in opportunity for leader processing outside group sessions, thereby enabling the leaders to more satisfactorily reflect and make sense of what has occurred, and for making alterations and plans for the next sessions. It is important to be reminded that co-leadership is often more time consuming than is solo leadership. Co-leaders must allow extra time for reaching agreements with one another and for post group processing meetings. It's also important to note that at times, particular co-leadership peers may not work well together, and may have a miserable time with one another. Still, if proper selection of co-leaders is made and they devote the necessary time for continuing processing outside the group to help them keep their communications clear and effective, then co-leadership of psychoeducational groups is a highly desirable model. Let's watch. 

00:08:55

00:09:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Hey Megan! How are you? 

00:09:00
MEGAN MARSHALL Hi Shirin! Good. How are you doing? 

00:09:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Good to see you. 

00:09:00
MEGAN MARSHALL Good to see you. Have a seat. 

00:09:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:09:05
MEGAN MARSHALL What's up? 

00:09:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Well, I just spoke with the International Students Office and they're interested in having me develop a career development program for international students. 

00:09:15
MEGAN MARSHALL Really? That's great. 

00:09:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Yeah. It sounds like a really neat opportunity. I could really use your help on this project. This is the first time I've worked with the International Students Office. I wanna really make sure that this goes well. Does this sound like something you'd be interested in? 

00:09:30
MEGAN MARSHALL Yeah. I've focused a lot of my programs, ah, my projects in on career development, so this would be great experience for me. 

00:09:35
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. We did some work during practicum class. 

00:09:40
MEGAN MARSHALL Yeah. 

00:09:40
SHIRIN VAKHARIA And maybe this could be an opportunity for us to work together on a project. 

00:09:40
MEGAN MARSHALL I think it seems like a little bit bigger project than practicum, but it sounds great. 

00:09:45
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we can think about sometime that we can meet and talk about what you feel comfortable doing, what pieces you might wanna take on so that you're working on something that you're comfortable in. 

00:09:55
MEGAN MARSHALL I would really like to do that. It would really help me to know kind of what you're expecting from me. 

00:10:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:10:00
MEGAN MARSHALL And, ah, also I know that sometimes I have a little bit more difficult time being really directing groups. 

00:10:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:10:05
MEGAN MARSHALL So, may we could work through some of that. 

00:10:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Yeah, that's good information to have, we can set up sometime to talk. 

00:10:10
MEGAN MARSHALL I hope its work better together. 

00:10:15
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:10:15
F.ROBERT WILSON Planning encompasses many activities such as ensuring that the group to be offered is based on solid conceptual foundation that will be within the scope or practice with the leaders, and that the group's goals, themes, and activities are interrelated and sequenced properly. A part of planning that is especially important for psychoeducational groups is that the group and its plan fit the needs and the situation of the group members. Collaborative ecological processes are important for group leaders in designing the group. This means that leaders work with representative members of the target population to create the plan as opposed to parachuting in a plan that they've created in isolation. Effective psychoeducation groups work with the group member rather than working on them. Leaders must integrate their expert competencies in group work leadership with the natural expertness of the members about their own lives. In a real sense, leaders and members become co-experts, working together to produce a psychoeducation group plan that is ecologically valid. 

00:11:25
JULIA LINKOVA Well, you are right. I think it's important to schedule the, the workshop when most of the people can come. And that's why I think, ah, meeting on Saturdays, one to two Saturdays, maybe three, four, uhm, hours in the morning would be a good idea because of all the studying that people do on weeknights. 

00:11:40
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh hmm. 

00:11:40
JULIA LINKOVA And, ah, that way, it will be easier for people to take time off work than to give up a night of studying. 

00:11:50
ELISHA H. KAFTAL I see your point. Maybe Saturday morning will work better. 

00:11:50
MEGAN MARSHALL Okay. Let's talk about location. Shirin and I were thinking that we would have the group at our office facility in the classroom. On Saturdays, there really aren't any classes in the building. And also, we have keys to everything, so we could have really - 

00:12:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh hmm. 

00:12:05
MEGAN MARSHALL - easy accessibility to getting a class space, uhm, what do you think the people would be able to reach the facility okay? 

00:12:10
KIMBERLY MCGINNIS-HEMPHILL I think that you office facility is a great location especially because of the parking. Uhm, most of the people, they won't really need to drive, but for those who might need to, 

00:12:20
MEGAN MARSHALL Uh hmm. 

00:12:20
KIMBERLY MCGINNIS-HEMPHILL - it's especially accessible - 

00:12:20
MEGAN MARSHALL Uh hmm. 

00:12:20
KIMBERLY MCGINNIS-HEMPHILL - for that lot that you have. 

00:12:20
ELISHA H. KAFTAL That's good. 

00:12:25
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Great. Well, maybe we ought to talk about what the workshop should cover. Eli, I think you mentioned that we'd wanna talk about the interview process, how to interview with a Western employer. What were you thinking on that? 

00:12:35
ELISHA H. KAFTAL Oh, well yes. Ah, I think a big problem with, ah, non-Western students is comprehending how Westerners expect them to behave - 

00:12:45
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh hmm. 

00:12:45
ELISHA H. KAFTAL - and what is right to do and what is not ah, to be more assertive or to be less assertive in an interview, to start up first or wait to be questioned. And then there always the hurdle of language, ah, what do they do if they don't know a word or phrase? Do they not say anything and hope to kind of wing it or do they openly admit that they don't know or, that, that's a big deal. 

00:13:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Right. Right. So working out some of the problems that might come out in an interview is something we wanna talk about. 

00:13:10
ELISHA H. KAFTAL Uh hmm. 

00:13:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Maybe we need to backtrack and talk about the application process. A lot of times, problems that come up in the interview can be headed off by working through the application process really well. What are your thoughts? 

00:13:20
JULIA LINKOVA Ah, I, I totally agree. I think it's important that participants learn how to fill out the application, how to write an application letter because, uhm, if you put the right stuff in the application, the, ah, interviews can, ah, can be a lot easier. 

00:13:35
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh hmm. 

00:13:40
MEGAN MARSHALL Tell me more about what you're thinking, in your experience, what is the right stuff? 

00:13:45
JULIA LINKOVA Well, I think, I think it's important that, that you just put everything that you n-- know how to do, everything that, that you learn in there, that you're not shy to figure things out. 

00:14:00
F.ROBERT WILSON Following their meeting with the reference group, the leaders meet to share their research and to discuss what they've learned from the reference group members. 

00:14:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA As I mentioned in my telephone message, I wanted to get together today so we could talk about some of the research that I've been going through and maybe you can share what you've come up with before we get started on developing the group. 

00:14:20
MEGAN MARSHALL I felt like meeting with the reference group was so helpful. It really helped me pull it together and hopefully I can share with you if I pull together the information from the library that we've been gathering - 

00:14:30
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:14:30
MEGAN MARSHALL - and the career resource library that we've gathered information from. 

00:14:30
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh hmm. That would be great. I think I remember reading too that we wanna make sure that we have a lot of structure in the group. 

00:14:40
MEGAN MARSHALL I think we should structure the group - 

00:14:40
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh huh. 

00:14:40
MEGAN MARSHALL - more in a pattern where we're giving information then we demonstrate, then we have them try it and practice, and we process the whole thing. 

00:14:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. Yeah, that sounds like what was mentioned in the big blue book - 

00:14:50
MEGAN MARSHALL Yeah. 

00:14:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA - the one we keep going back to every time we have to develop these career development programs. 

00:14:55
MEGAN MARSHALL That seems like it really has a lot of good information for us. 

00:15:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Yeah. It's an excellent resource to turn to. 

00:15:00
MEGAN MARSHALL I was also talking to, uhm, the director at the International Student Office and he was saying that really, students are very concerned about all the paperwork. 

00:15:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Yeah. I think that's an important piece that we really wanna make sure we address like the tax forms and employment verifications and all those pieces. 

00:15:15
MEGAN MARSHALL It could be really overwhelming. 

00:15:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Yeah. I know it's overwhelming for me, so I can't imagine having to do all that from another country. Sure 

00:15:25
MEGAN MARSHALL So I probably should put a session in just dealing with the paperwork. 

00:15:25
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. Okay. What I came up with when I was reading was addressing the information on interviewing. It helps them prepare for real job interviews by becoming more comfortable talking directly with employers, gathering information about their chosen occupation and so forth 'coz that might be something we wanna think about including. 

00:15:45
MEGAN MARSHALL That sounds great. That's that step by step shaping stuff, isn't it? 

00:15:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh hmm. 

00:15:50
MEGAN MARSHALL I think it will make the people in the group feel more in control of their job search. 

00:15:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Sure. I remember the reference group mentioned that they thought the information interviewing piece would be really helpful because that would give them an opportunity to practice talking directly with an employer without having a job on the line. 

00:16:05
MEGAN MARSHALL What. 

00:16:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA And I know that was scary. 

00:16:05
MEGAN MARSHALL Can you tell me a little more about what you mean? 

00:16:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Well, we could set up practice sessions with group members. Have an opportunity to informational interview with real employers. 

00:16:15
MEGAN MARSHALL I guess we'll have to make sure that they realize it's not a real interview and that it's just a mock interview. 

00:16:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Definitely. We wanna set that up right upfront. 

00:16:20
MEGAN MARSHALL That sounds great. 

00:16:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Maybe we could look at the design for the group. 

00:16:25
MEGAN MARSHALL Actually, in one of our group classes, I put together a career exploration outline. Maybe we should take a look at that to help us get started. 

00:16:30
SHIRIN VAKHARIA That sounds like a great idea. 

00:16:30
MEGAN MARSHALL Let me see if I can get that. 

00:16:35
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:16:35
F.ROBERT WILSON The group leaders are well on the way. They've collected ideas from several sources; the literature, employers, and a reference group made up of people who are just like the targeted audience. Now, they're focusing in on developing their group design. 

00:16:55
SHIRIN VAKHARIA I like the outline, Megan. For me, it's helpful to start with goals. I think we wanna make sure that we're really clear on what we're trying to accomplish here, then we can look at the content and process. 

00:17:00
MEGAN MARSHALL I think that's a great idea. Maybe one of our goals should be to have them be able to describe the process of career development and job search - 

00:17:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh hmm. 

00:17:10
MEGAN MARSHALL - and then list the steps. 

00:17:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. And then maybe have a practice session, giving folks an opportunity to talk with an important Western culture person - 

00:17:20
MEGAN MARSHALL Absolutely. 

00:17:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA - about things like interviewing, salary negotiation, career exploration, and so forth. 

00:17:25
MEGAN MARSHALL Absolutely. That sounds great. 

00:17:25
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:17:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE All groups, ah, require careful planning. This statement is no more true than for psychoeducation groups. Psychoeducation groups that has been mentioned involve a clear focus combined with brief time limits, and they usually have a beginning and an end. More overall-- moreover this type of group as ah, its title implies involves attention, both to psychological as well as to educational factors. Ah, finally, psychoeducation groups comprise a combination of attention to content and skills, as well as attention to group process. Because of all of these characteristics, psychoeducation groups really requires special, careful planning. This plan should be both overarching, as well as specific. Ah, by overarching, we mean that the plan should present, uhm, the big picture of the group, its overall purposes, ah, conceptual foundations supporting theory and research as related to the group, particular contextual factors that may relate to the offering of this group in the, in the setting, ah, the target population that is involved, ah, the general group goals and major methods and processes and strategies that will be used during the group, the developmental progress and the group development model that will be used to guide the group over time, and how implementation that is performing of the group as well as processing of the group will be included and measured. The plan also needs to be specific. That is, the overall plan should be broken down into a session by session format, with each session building progressively upon the previous sessions in setting the stage for next sessions. Helpful planning tips for each session includes, ah, indicating the session goals, and those activities associated with each one of those goals, uhm, who is responsible for each planned activity in the conduct of this, ah, of the session, the amount of time allocated for each activity, uhm, any resources ah, needed such as materials or paper pencils and so forth. And ah, importantly, uhm, allocation of processing time, ah, that would be used to reflect on what happened during the session. Ah, because most psychoeducational groups, ah, will be closed ah, to new members once the group has begun with a predetermined number of sessions of a designated length, it's possible for the group leaders to, to really develop such a plan as we are describing here. That plan then can be used for a number of purposes including to explain the group to perspective group members and to guide the group through its ensuing sessions. So, let's take a look at what follows. 

00:20:15
SHIRIN VAKHARIA I'm trying to select an activity that will teach the group members how to practice giving and receiving feedback appropriately. I have these two. What do you think? 

00:20:30
MEGAN MARSHALL Let me take a look at it. 

00:20:35
[sil.] 

00:20:45
MEGAN MARSHALL I think I like this first one. It seems to call for less self-disclosure. 

00:20:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-hmm. 

00:20:50
MEGAN MARSHALL It just seems a little less intrusive. 

00:20:55
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-hmm. That's what I was thinking, too. Why don't we go with that one? 

00:20:55
MEGAN MARSHALL Okay. 

00:20:55
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay 

00:20:55
MEGAN MARSHALL That sounds great. 

00:21:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Let's do it. 

00:21:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE As the plan is being developed, it can be very helpful for group leaders to test it with representative members of the target population. These people might well be the same members who participated in the initial reference group. A tendency for group leaders at this point is to have prepared a plan that seems perfect to them, scholarly and technically correct, but really which may feel very awkward or off the mark to prospective members or might just be completely inappropriate. It's far better to work out any kinks in the plan by talking with representative group members for their ideas and their input. Leaders might ask representative members about different levels of the plan. For instance, have we chosen the right goals? How does the plan's overall length seem? Uhm, does it seem reasonable that members would try out these skills? Is the whole thing really on target? Is it something that would fit within the context of these people's lives? And what suggestions do you have for changes? It would also be useful to discuss marketing while the reference group is assembled. Even the best of plans fail if participants do not partake of the plan. It's sort of like, have you ever given a party and nobody comes? We want to avoid that sort of condition. Reference group members may help answer a question such as how best can we get members to sign up for the group, or how do we contact the people who really need this program. These are vital important questions, and any psychoed group would fail without answering these successfully. Testing and refining a plan through this kind of interaction with rep, representative group members can add another layer of surety to the plan and improve chances for the group's success. So let's take a look at the reference group as it meets again. 

00:23:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Kim, come on in. 

00:23:05
KIMBERLY MCGINNIS-HEMPHILL Hi everyone! How are you? 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN Hi. 

00:23:05
ELISHA H. KAFTAL Oh, hi Kim! 

00:23:05
MEGAN MARSHALL Hi Kim. 

00:23:05
ELISHA H. KAFTAL How are you doing? 

00:23:05
KIMBERLY MCGINNIS-HEMPHILL I'm doing well. 

00:23:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Have a seat. 

00:23:10
KIMBERLY MCGINNIS-HEMPHILL Thank you. 

00:23:15
SHIRIN VAKHARIA I'm glad you are all able to join us today. Did everyone receive the group plan? 

00:23:20
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. Yes. 

00:23:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. Everyone had a chance to take a look at it? 

00:23:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:23:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Good. Well, Megan and I are hoping to do today is to get some feedback from you all in terms of the group plan. We want to really make sure that this program is gonna enhance the career success of international students. 

00:23:35
JULIA LINKOVA Uh-hmm. Well, I really liked the plan and, ah, I think the best thing about it was that you asked different international students about their problems when they were starting their careers. You guys, the skills that you're gonna be teaching are exactly the kind of things that I had problems when I was getting started, like, uhm, knowing how much to say about myself - 

00:24:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
JULIA LINKOVA - and ah, not knowing how to talk to American employer re-- recruiter, feeling uncomfortable talking about salary. Uhm, I, I really wish groups like this were available when I was just getting started. 

00:24:15
MEGAN MARSHALL Julia, I'm glad you feel that way. That's a real vote of confidence for us who have been planning this group. 

00:24:20
JULIA LINKOVA Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
MEGAN MARSHALL Ah, one thing to remember though is that you gave us such good input, that you've really helped to create this plan. 

00:24:25
JULIA LINKOVA Thanks. 

00:24:25
ELISHA H. KAFTAL And how did you free parking anyway from the university? I mean, I honestly was worried about, ah, people either not wanting to take the time or not, ah, wanting to walk all the way from the commuter parking. 

00:24:35
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Hmm. 

00:24:40
MEGAN MARSHALL Actually, that was Shirin's doing. Shirin, tell them how you got the parking. 

00:24:40
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Well, I mentioned to the director of the International Students Office that Megan and I were offering this program on an experimental basis to enhance the career success of international students. So in exchange for the value of information we'll get with the program, she offered to give us parking passes, so it was a nice trade. 

00:25:00
ELISHA H. KAFTAL Wow! That's a good deal. 

00:25:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh hmm. 

00:25:05
ELISHA H. KAFTAL I guess if your program goes well, then other people will support you too. 

00:25:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Yeah. 

00:25:05
MEGAN MARSHALL I'm really glad you brought up about the parking because that was something we had not thought about at all. Uhm, so it's good that you brought that up. What about the other concerns that you had? 

00:25:15
KIMBERLY MCGINNIS-HEMPHILL Well, I had been worried about whether it would be an information-giving workshop or whether people would actually have the opportunity to practice the information that we know. 

00:25:25
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Yeah. I remember you mentioning that that was one of your concerns when we first met. 

00:25:30
KIMBERLY MCGINNIS-HEMPHILL Well, I was happy to see that there were so many opportunities for people to practice, practice reading the actual job description, uhm, practice writing a one-page resume, practice interviewing the skills, having the pra-- the opportunity to practice with an interviewer, also having the opportunity to practice calling for information. Uhm, I think that we have, we all have the ability to read, as well as the participants who will come to the workshop, but I think it would be good to have the chance to actually practice, uhm, to have someone actually watch for our mistakes, and then to give us the opportunity to correct our mistakes. 

00:26:05
MEGAN MARSHALL Well, I don't know if I would call them mistakes, but I know exactly what you mean. It's a lot like sports. It's one thing to talk about how you might move, but then it's a totally different - 

00:26:15
JULIA LINKOVA Uh hmm. 

00:26:15
MEGAN MARSHALL - playing field when you go to actually do it. What we are really worried about was getting too little information and too much - 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:26:20
MEGAN MARSHALL - practice time. Tell me what you think now that you've seen the plan. 

00:26:25
JULIA LINKOVA Well, I really liked it, uhm, the information that you're providing is helpful, but I was worried that you would spend too much time lecturing cuz the, the hand-outs and workshop, worksheets, they help but really the practice is what drives it home. 

00:26:45
ROBERT K. CONYNE Once the final plan is established, the next step is recruitment. Success in recruitment depends on the approach used. Impersonal recruitment strategies such as the posting of flyers, handing out of brochures, and other indirect ways though frequently used are usually poor means for attracting participants. Much greater success may be found in a personalized approach. We recommend the group leaders find the ways to meet face to face with prospective participants so that those participants could see, hear, feel, and size up the group leaders. Such a face-to-face contact also permits the leaders, who know their intended group offering the best of anyone, to sell themselves and their group effectively. Even more important, it provides the prospective members an opportunity to take immediate action. For example, to ask questions, to fill out an application form, to make an appointment for a personal interview; thus, increasing the chance they will follow through and join the group. Now watch as the leaders discuss recruitment strategies. 

00:27:55
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Hey Megan! Did Dr. Gupta(ph) call you back? 

00:28:00
MEGAN MARSHALL Actually, she did give me call back, uhm, she said that we could go in to her class next Monday. 

00:28:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:28:05
MEGAN MARSHALL She would give us about 15 minutes to describe our project and recruit members. 

00:28:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:28:05
MEGAN MARSHALL Uhm, one of the problems is, uhm, the class is diverse, so, uhm, we're not gonna really gonna be able to say that it's just for international students - 

00:28:15
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. 

00:28:15
MEGAN MARSHALL - which is a little bit problematic because we did design the group around international students. 

00:28:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-hmm. You know, maybe we can post flyers at the Cultural Center, the, uhm, Student Services building. 

00:28:30
MEGAN MARSHALL Are there other groups we could go to and make a presentation to recruit some members? 

00:28:35
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Yeah. You know, I was thinking about that too cuz flyers usually don't work, uhm, at least in my experience I don't get much response from that. I know Eli suggested that we might be able to come in and talk to, ah, the international student group the next time they have a social, but she needed to check with the director to make sure that would be okay. Maybe we can come up with an information sheet or something that people could tear off if they're interested. 

00:28:55
MEGAN MARSHALL You know, I think she would be a good contact since she's connected to that group. 

00:29:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. Yeah. I think it might be a more effective way of getting people for the group than just hoping that they call based on our flyers. 

00:29:05
MEGAN MARSHALL Good idea. 

00:29:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:29:10
Performing 

00:29:15
F.ROBERT WILSON Performing is the second ASGW's best practices in group work. Performing is what leaders actually do during the group sessions. And it is crucially important. For that reason, leader performance has captured the lion's share of attention in the professional literature. Generally, performance of group work leadership involves being able to use specific competencies effectively to provide therapeutic conditions within the group, to use group observation and interpretation skills to discern trends and patterns of group dynamics, and to be able to adapt the group plan, to respond to observed dynamics and idiosyncratic events within the ongoing group. In psychoeducational groups, which are semi-structured and focused, attention is given to both psychological and educational facets. Historically, psychoeducational groups have been criticized for a failure to balance content and process, emphasizing content to the sacrifice of attending to the process of the group. In the performance model, we endorse for psychoeducational groups, leaders work with the members to set and maintain a productive and safe working environment that evolves consistently with the development of the group over time. The performance model provides for presenting content, describing skills, demonstrating skills, providing learning activities where members can practice skill development, receive feedback, and retry the skill, engaging in discussion to connect within group learnings to outer world situations, and discussing the process of the group to help members understand how the group is going about its work and the surface feelings associated with the events that have happened in the group. 

00:31:15
Performing ✓providing expert instructional information ✓demonstrating associated skills to be practiced and learned ✓providing practice time ✓providing feedback (from members, from leaders) ✓providing re-practice time 

00:31:15
F.ROBERT WILSON The intent through implementation of the steps in the performance model is to teach and train using both relevant instructional information and group processes so that members can become more able. In the sample excerpt of the psychoeducation session that follows, watch as the leaders provide expert instructional information, demonstrate a related skill to be practiced and learned, provide practice time for members by using paired member practice design, observe and supervise the practice diads, provide and remember in leader feedback, provide opportunity for members to retry the skill after they've received feedback. Let's watch now as the group leader work with their group members. The group is well started. The leaders had presented information on several topics, and the members have had the opportunity to interact practice skills and talk about their learning. We join the group as the leaders are introducing the idea of informational interviewing. We'll follow the group through one cycle of their design in which the leaders teach informational interviewing. The members give it a try. Feedback is shared, and the members re-practice their skill. Finally, the members will talk about their learning experience. 

00:32:45
[sil.] 

00:32:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA We've spent the last few sessions talking about the importance of conducting a strategic job search here in, in the United States. I think we've all agreed that, uhm, when conducting a job search, it's important to have current information about your chosen career, about your salary expectations, uhm, resume development, and so forth. 

00:33:10
MEGAN MARSHALL One of the things that we recognized is that your job search is not just library activities which we've been talking about things that you're going to be doing all, all by yourself. So what we're hoping to do today is give you insight on how you might get information from the community. And one of the ways that you'll do that is through an informational interview. 

00:33:30
SHIRIN VAKHARIA And I'm sure when you all came to the United States, you might have gathered information or gotten a lot of help from some of your friends, things like grocery shopping, where to live, uhm, where, where you wanted to hang out and so forth. What are some other, uhm, ideas? 

00:33:45
UNKNOWN Uhm, helping them to make other friends. 

00:33:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN Finding an apartment to live. 

00:33:55
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:33:55
MEGAN MARSHALL Yeah. 

00:33:55
UNKNOWN Getting in good health. 

00:33:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:34:00
UNKNOWN Who's the most helpful to people from my country. 

00:34:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Sure. 

00:34:00
MEGAN MARSHALL Uh-huh. 

00:34:00
UNKNOWN How to speak English. 

00:34:05
MEGAN MARSHALL That's great. Let's think about out job search in a similar manner. It's a way for us to, we need to get an exchange information, about our info-- about our experiences and our qualifications and the things that we're interested in doing. And that's the way that we would do it in the U.S. is developing some of those contacts. 

00:34:25
UNKNOWN Ah, I never thought of what I'd get when I moved here as networking. 

00:34:30
MEGAN MARSHALL Hmm. 

00:34:30
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Yeah. I suppose you wouldn't. But a lot of what we do on a day to day basis in terms of problem solving is networking. We access resources and information in order to help us solve problems. 

00:34:40
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:34:40
MEGAN MARSHALL There are really four points that we wanna keep in mind when we're thinking about informational interview. If you can remember these four points, uhm, you will really be a success when you're doing this. Shirin, can you pass out - 

00:34:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Sure. 

00:34:50
MEGAN MARSHALL - those handouts? You can use this as a reference. The first thing that you wanna do is information gather. You're gathering information from a particular employer. You're also looking for advice. This person is probably an expert in what they're doing if they're currently employed or at least we hope they're an expert in what they're doing if they're currently employed in that given field. Also, you wanna receive some recommendations on potential people that you also may be able to make contact with. So getting those ah, recommendations are good. And the last most, ah, not the most important thing but one essential piece that we forget about sometimes is you wanna be remembered. You want them to remember you for two different reasons. The first being that, uhm, if something comes up in their company, they might keep you in mind, so you want that to be an opportunity for you. And also if they meet someone who has a career goal, uhm, similar to yours or they're in that field. So that's another reason you wanna be remembered. 

00:35:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA It's important to keep in mind that an information interview is not a job interview, okay. It's an opportunity for you to gather information that might be helpful for you during your job search. Maybe we can think about the kind of information or questions that you might wanna ask when conducting an information interview. Maybe, folks can just throw out some ideas, what would you wanna know if you were conducting an information interview? 

00:36:15
UNKNOWN Well, I, I wanna know what the market looks like. Are people hiring? 

00:36:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. Uh-huh. Sure. Other points? 

00:36:20
UNKNOWN Uhm, how much they would pay me at a certain level. 

00:36:25
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. So maybe some information about salary. Sure. 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN It would be good to know what areas of the country would be good to go for certain types of jobs. 

00:36:35
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. You may not be limited to this area. You want to examine other options. Uh-huh. 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN And how relevant, ah, I mean how relevant is an advanced degree in additional qualifications. 

00:36:45
MEGAN MARSHALL Great. That's a very good question. 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN Get the market in the future. 

00:36:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. Where are things headed. Sure. 

00:36:50
MEGAN MARSHALL Those are great questions. I think you're going to get some really relevant career information from those questions. Also, let's talk about, uhm, what kind of an impression we're going to make. 

00:37:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. Yeah. We need to talk about the impression you'll make in this cultural context. Certainly, if you are in your native country, you might know how to go about making a good impression with an employer within that cultural context. But maybe we can talk a little bit about how one goes about making an impression here in the United States. What are some things you might wanna keep in mind. 

00:37:20
UNKNOWN It's hard for me, ah, I suppose I have to brag myself, but I'm not raised to do so - 

00:37:25
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN - in my culture, uhm, so if I do so, people will think really badly of me. 

00:37:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. Kind of maybe along that line too. Uhm, here, I don't have any relatives to introduce me to ah, employers. That's what we normally do back home. 

00:37:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:37:45
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. So you don't have the kinds of contacts here that you might have at home and so - 

00:37:50
UNKNOWN Exactly. 

00:37:55
SHIRIN VAKHARIA - how to go about doing that - 

00:37:55
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:37:55
SHIRIN VAKHARIA - might be difficult., uhm, some of the cultural differences here are uncomfortable and feeling natural for you. 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:38:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uhm, so it might be helpful to have that information. 

00:38:05
MEGAN MARSHALL I think probably, Shirin, one of the best ways that we could probably, uhm, work on this skill is to maybe practice, and, uhm, we can give you a demonstration. 

00:38:10
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:38:10
MEGAN MARSHALL I mean, you all can try it in pairs and receive a feedback. How does that sound? 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN Sounds good. 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. Okay. 

00:38:20
MEGAN MARSHALL Okay. It's a little bit more of a comfortable environment for you to do it here instead of going right out with an employer? 

00:38:25
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:38:25
MEGAN MARSHALL Okay. That sounds good. 

00:38:25
SHIRIN VAKHARIA And I think it's important to point out too that what we're demonstrating today is how one it goes about conducting an information interview as a potential job seeker, not necessarily how an employer would conduct an information interview. Okay. We're all here as group members trying to learn this process so we wanna really emphasize that today. 

00:38:45
MEGAN MARSHALL And we will have you play, uhm, an employer but we certainly don't expect that you will know exactly what an employer might do so just do the best you can when you're playing in that role. 

00:38:55
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:38:55
F.ROBERT WILSON To get their point across, the leaders demonstrate the informational interviewing skill that they want their participants to learn. 

00:39:05
MEGAN MARSHALL Shirin, why don't we ah, sit in the middle of the group? 

00:39:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:39:05
MEGAN MARSHALL And they can watch then what we're going to do. 

00:39:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Great. 

00:39:15
[sil.] 

00:39:25
MEGAN MARSHALL Okay. How we're going to set this up is I'm going to be the interviewee and Shirin is going to be playing the employer. Okay. What we wanna pay particular attention to is my introduction, how I introduce myself, uhm, the questions that I ask, and also how I present myself during the informational interview. Okay. Are we ready? 

00:39:45
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:39:45
MEGAN MARSHALL Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the time to meet with me today. 

00:39:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Sure. No problem. As I mentioned to you on the phone, I have about 20 minutes or so to spend today. I'd be happy to help in any way I can. 

00:39:55
MEGAN MARSHALL That's great. Twenty minutes is probably all I need. I really have focused in on the questions that I would like to ask you. So could you give me a good sense of how you feel the job outlook looks for counseling right now? 

00:40:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. Ah, are you looking for information more locally or, or nationally? 

00:40:10
MEGAN MARSHALL I guess I'd really like your perspective on where you think things are locally or if you feel like I might need to relocate nationally. 

00:40:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay, okay. So you might be open to relocation nationally? 

00:40:20
MEGAN MARSHALL Sure, I think so. 

00:40:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. Certainly, there are lots of different directions. You can go in as a counselor. I know in this area. There's colleges and universities, community mental health settings,, uhm, substance abuse settings. Really sort of depends on your interest area. Where do you think you're headed? 

00:40:40
MEGAN MARSHALL Well, I have had lots of experience in career development, in terms of gathering experience in the career development office on the university campus, but certainly I feel like there are probably more career development opportunities within the community. 

00:40:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. 

00:40:50
MEGAN MARSHALL And so I'm feeling like I would like to get some more information on that. 

00:40:55
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. So maybe branching out of the university setting and looking at some other options in career development local. 

00:41:00
MEGAN MARSHALL Right. Because my experience has been so focused in on - 

00:41:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:41:00
MEGAN MARSHALL - the university setting - 

00:41:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. 

00:41:00
MEGAN MARSHALL - I'd like to know what else is out there? 

00:41:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
MEGAN MARSHALL And I know that you're in a community setting, so I think you probably would have a good sense of that. 

00:41:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. Yeah, one of the big areas right now, I think, is the vocational rehabilitation movement. There's a lot of emphasis to get people back into employment. You're a Department of Human Service folks, community mental health agencies. A lot of the typical welfare organizations and so forth are looking at assisting folks to employment. That's certainly an area that, as a counselor you might wanna look into, if you're interested in career. 

00:41:35
F.ROBERT WILSON After the demonstration, the leaders arranged for the members to work in pairs, to practice the things they've heard about them saying. Because the members are students, the leaders provide instructions on how an employer should act and provide a short rehearsal to help the students learn the employer's role. The members are given sheets with samples answers to questions that they can use while they're trying to play the role of employer. Then, the members begin to practice their informational interviewing skills. 

00:42:05
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER My name is Daam Tapiwa Barker. Ah, thank you for agreeing to see me this morning. 

00:42:10
SHANA ELAGBRI It's nice to meet you. I understand you'd liked this to be an informational interview. And I'll be happy to help. Where would you like to begin? 

00:42:20
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER Well, I've prepared a list of questions. So maybe we can just start with the first question. 

00:42:25
SHANA ELAGBRI Uh-hmm, sure. Ah, it sounds like you're well-prepared. Go ahead. 

00:42:30
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER Well, I've been doing some reading recently, and it seems to me like the market for graphic design is dwindling. How do you see the market? 

00:42:40
SHANA ELAGBRI Well, I think it's true that there has been a decline recently in the graphic design market. However, industry experts are projecting that trend to change in a positive direction with, within the next five to ten years. 

00:42:50
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER Hmm. That's interesting. Cause I'm planning to graduate with a Degree in Graphic Design in the next year, and I'm wondering, maybe if it might not be more beneficial to, if, if, if the market is gonna be the way it is now, to continue on and get my master's and then enter the market. 

00:43:10
SHANA ELAGBRI Hmm. Well, I definitely think the market will be tight when you graduate. Although if you're willing to relocate, you might be able to find employment, uhm, graduate school's certainly an option now. The only disadvantagement from an employer's perspective is that you're entering the market with no experience - 

00:43:30
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER Uh-hmm. 

00:43:30
SHANA ELAGBRI - and with an advanced degree. They might be concerned about your salary expectations. 

00:43:35
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER Hmm. That's interesting. I haven't really thought about that. 

00:43:40
SHANA ELAGBRI Uh-hmm. 

00:43:40
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER I guess I should spend some time thinking about that. You know there was another question that I had too. 

00:43:45
SHANA ELAGBRI Uh-hmm. 

00:43:45
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER Ah, I'm wondering, ah, will employers be concerned with hiring me because I'm a foreigner? 

00:43:55
SHANA ELAGBRI What are you concerns about being an international student? 

00:43:55
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER Well, some of my friends were foreigners that have some difficulty in a job search, uhm, you know, their visa's and, and - 

00:44:05
SHANA ELAGBRI Uh hmm. 

00:44:05
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER - different restrictions in what not. How do you think I should go about handling that? 

00:44:10
SHANA ELAGBRI You have to have your employer's support to get a working visa. But I guess I'm sure you already know, some small employers may not want to get involved with any extra work. 

00:44:20
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER Uh-hmm. 

00:44:20
SHANA ELAGBRI I think you should let the employer know you need to get your working visa and that you'll do the research and any other necessary paperwork that's required. 

00:44:30
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER Okay. Well thanks for your help. I really appreciate that. This is some pretty valuable information. 

00:44:35
SHANA ELAGBRI You're very welcome. 

00:44:40
F.ROBERT WILSON In the example you just saw, the information seeker was well-prepared for the informational interview. In the next role play, a group member is not so well-prepared and has difficulty gathering information. 

00:44:55
FAN YE Hi, my name is Fan Ye, uhm, thank you very much for taking time to meet with me this morning. 

00:45:00
ARIF ALTUN The pleasure is mine. It gives me the opportunity to share my experience in information about the engineering field with others. I enjoy conducting informational interviews. So, ah, where would you like to begin? 

00:45:15
FAN YE Well, actually I'm not really sure and I was hoping you would tell me. 

00:45:15
ARIF ALTUN Uhm, well, okay. Maybe you, you could tell me what information would be helpful for you to have? 

00:45:25
FAN YE Could you tell me whether your company is hiring right now? 

00:45:30
ARIF ALTUN Well, right now there are a few entry-level positions available, but you may want to check the job board when you leave. 

00:45:35
FAN YE Uh hmm. I could do that, uhm, I was wondering how much, uhm, do you pay well? 

00:45:40
ARIF ALTUN Well our, our salaries are competitive for the industry. 

00:45:45
FAN YE You see, I'm going to be an entry-level engineer. What's the range for entry-level workers? 

00:45:55
ARIF ALTUN Well, 40,000 to 50,000 is the going rate for inexperienced engineers. 

00:46:00
FAN YE Okay. I just thought of another question. How important is it for me to take the state licensure exam? 

00:46:05
ARIF ALTUN Oh, it's critical. You cannot, ah, prac-- you cannot practice engineering without it. 

00:46:10
FAN YE Oh! Really. Okay, that's good to know. Thanks. 

00:46:15
F.ROBERT WILSON A key to success in skill practice is corrective feedback. When all pairs had sufficient time to attempt an informational interview, the leaders talk to them about giving constructive feedback. Now the practice pairs are beginning to share their feedback with one another. 

00:46:35
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER But was I too pushy? I felt like I was too pushy. 

00:46:35
SHANA ELAGBRI You know it didn't feel like that to me. I thought you were very well prepared and your interest showed. 

00:46:45
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Yeah. You might have been a little bit more forceful than what you're used to - 

00:46:50
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER Hmm. 

00:46:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA - but in the United States, there's an expectation or an appreciation of being direct - 

00:46:55
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER Okay. 

00:46:55
SHIRIN VAKHARIA - and a little bit more assertive. Uhm, and I know that probably it felt uncomfortable to you. 

00:47:00
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER It did. 

00:47:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA I'd like the way you expressed appreciation to the employer, for meeting with you during the information interview. 

00:47:05
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER Okay. 

00:47:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA You might wanna take that step further by mentioning that you're aware that she only has 20 minutes to spend with you. And that just sends her the message that you're going to kind of stick with that agreement upfront. 

00:47:15
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER Okay. 

00:47:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:47:20
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER I'm wondering also if, uhm, it might not be a good idea to then shake hands if it's not a bad idea to be direct? 

00:47:30
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Absolutely, I mean that's a very common practice in the United States when you greet somebody, to extend you hand and she can pick-up from there. I think that would be appropriate. Sure. 

00:47:40
FAN YE Well, maybe you could just tell me what you saw? And I just want to know what you have seen to get better? 

00:47:50
ARIF ALTUN Well, you, you seem polite and interested. 

00:47:50
FAN YE Okay. Great. I thought you were going to say something, you know, real negative about my performance, uhm, but you know, I still have the feeling that I didn't do the right things. I got so nervous, I, I don't think I said it right. 

00:48:05
ARIF ALTUN Well it might have been better if you knew what you wanted from the employer as you get in. And you asked him to tell you, tell you what you, what you should, ah, want to know. Did I hear right? 

00:48:20
FAN YE Yeah, I guess so. I guess I said something like, "I was hoping you would tell me." I guess that wasn't right, was it? 

00:48:25
ARIF ALTUN Well, I remember Shirin said that we should have made a list of what we want to know before we go in, did you forget? 

00:48:35
FAN YE I didn't. Actually, I, I do have a list somewhere, but when it came time for me to start, I got so nervous, I just forgot my questions. 

00:48:40
MEGAN MARSHALL Well that is so natural, uhm, to get nervous. We all get nervous when we're doing interviews. 

00:48:45
FAN YE Uh-huh. 

00:48:45
MEGAN MARSHALL And one of the things that we definitely wanna keep in mind is maybe to write down the questions and think about, uhm, how you would like to ask those questions. I know, when I get nervous my mind just go blank. 

00:49:00
FAN YE Uh-huh. Exactly. That's how I felt. 

00:49:00
MEGAN MARSHALL Yeah. And so if you write them down beforehand, that really helps. 

00:49:05
FAN YE Uh-huh. I could do that. 

00:49:10
F.ROBERT WILSON Having received feedback, the pair members re-practice their informational interviewing skills. 

00:49:15
MEGAN MARSHALL Why don't we try and re-practice what we've just done and see if we can improve a bit. 

00:49:20
FAN YE Uh-hmm. That'll be good. Okay. Hi, my name is Fan Ye. Thank you very much for taking time to meet with me this morning. 

00:49:30
ARIF ALTUN It's, its my plea-- it's, it's my pleasure, pleasure to have you here. I enjoy conducting informational interviews because it gives me pleasure to share my information and experience about engineering. And where would you like to begin? 

00:49:45
FAN YE Well, I mentioned on the phone that I'm an international student studying engineering at the University of Cincinnati, uhm, and I'm planning on graduating a couple of months, in June. I'm kind of concerned about the job search. I know job searching is very different here than in my native country. Uhm, I was wondering, maybe you could tell me something about the job market for, like an aeronautical engineer? 

00:50:10
ARIF ALTUN I'm sure you have heard about the recent job cuts lately. And the market is supposed to improve in the next five to ten years though. You may need to be flexible about what products the country you would like to move in. And ah, haven't you thought about that? 

00:50:30
FAN YE Yeah. I'm willing to go wherever I can get a job. Actually, I don't necessarily have to stay in Cincinnati, uhm, so are there any parts of the country that I'm more secured than others? 

00:50:40
ARIF ALTUN I think North Carolina is, ah, area is strong. 

00:50:45
FAN YE Okay. 

00:50:45
ARIF ALTUN A lot of companies have moved to that area because of the living conditions and the climate. You definitely should check into that part of the country. 

00:50:50
FAN YE Uh-huh. 

00:50:55
ARIF ALTUN Florida is good too. You may want to think about joining, joining the National Associations of Aeronautical Engineers. They can provide you with more information about these tracks. 

00:51:05
FAN YE Okay. I've never heard about this association. Maybe I should look into that, you know, and think about joining an organization while I still can get a student rate. Uhm, well the other thing that I'm kind of thinking about is, uhm, I don't know whether it's a good idea not to get into a master's program. What do you think? 

00:51:25
ARIF ALTUN Well graduate school is certainly an option. The only disadvantage from an employer. 

00:51:35
[sil.] 

00:51:35
Processing 

00:51:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE Processing is the third major best practice contributing to a successful group offering. Processing involves reflection and evaluation, both formative and summative, and more. It includes the attempts by group leaders within sessions to help members to make sense of their experience. In addition, processing includes between-session analysis where leaders examine what occurred and what might happen in the future. Engaging in these processing stuffs can help leaders to monitor if the group is being kept on course with the plan, and also can contribute to determining overall effectiveness. Now let's watch an example of within-group processing. 

00:52:25
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Now that we've had an opportunity to practice informational interviewing, I'm wondering if we can talk about what your experience was like? Who would like to begin? 

00:52:40
SHOU DONG FENG Uhm, I think it's a, a really good practice. Uhm, I think I know more what to expect from employers. 

00:52:50
MEGAN MARSHALL Okay. Good. 

00:52:50
JULIE DUHIGG Uhm, I had, I had trouble knowing like what to ask. So I was kind of doing some real general question - 

00:52:55
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-hmm. 

00:52:55
JULIE DUHIGG - hoping that the employer would know where I was getting at. 

00:53:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:53:00
JULIE DUHIGG And I know you told me to be direct, and then that's, that's something I'm gonna have to really practice. 

00:53:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

00:53:05
MEGAN MARSHALL You mean, with keeping specific even - 

00:53:05
JULIE DUHIGG Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:53:10
MEGAN MARSHALL - in terms of your questions. That's great. 

00:53:10
JULIE DUHIGG Yeah. 

00:53:10
DAAM TAPIWA BARKER Like Julie said too, I was concerned about being direct. That's very different for me and it's pretty hard, uhm, but in this country, people are direct. 

00:53:20
MEGAN MARSHALL Right Daam. Many of you have talked about how it's very different trying to, it's difficult to do something that's different from your home. 

00:53:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm 

00:53:30
MEGAN MARSHALL You've had three different practice sessions. Have your feelings stayed the same from the beginning of the practice to the end? 

00:53:35
ARIF ALTUN It got a little bit easier, but I still think, I still think it was uncomfortable to ask those questions - 

00:53:45
MEGAN MARSHALL Still felt it as uncomfortable. 

00:53:45
ARIF ALTUN - as an employer. 

00:53:45
FAN YE Yeah. I totally agree with that. It got a little bit easier, you know, as time went on, but it was still very hard. 

00:53:55
MEGAN MARSHALL Still difficult. Right. Well, you wanna, you may wanna try to re-practice a few more times than to make things more comfortable. 

00:54:00
FAN YE That will help. 

00:54:00
SHOU DONG FENG Uhm, I thought my English was much better the third time I tried, ah, and I, ah, know what to share and practiced and learned how to say it. 

00:54:15
MEGAN MARSHALL Hmm. Excellent. 

00:54:15
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Mei, what about you? What was it like for you? 

00:54:15
MEI TANG Well, I haven't thought about being like an employer, and when I was the employer, I tried to answer the questions that the interviewee asked. Ah, I guess ah, that's the way if I were the inquiry, I want to have a questions and they answer my questions. 

00:54:35
MEGAN MARSHALL That is a great observation. I know that I have been in this practice sessions before, and it's really helped me learn how to be an, what the employer might think about. So it has helped me to be a better interviewee. 

00:54:45
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:54:50
MEGAN MARSHALL That's great. 

00:54:50
MEI TANG Yes, yes. 

00:54:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Changing the perspective really helps. 

00:54:50
MEGAN MARSHALL Uh-huh. Yeah, it does. 

00:54:50
JULIE DUHIGG Yeah. When I did the role of employer, I can imagine what it will be like, what an employer really wants to know for me in giving an insight. Uh-huh, yeah, definitely, yeah. 

00:55:00
MEGAN MARSHALL Nothing like switching roles, right? 

00:55:00
JULIE DUHIGG Yes. Yeah. 

00:55:05
SHANA ELAGBRI Now, I thought it was a lot easier to do here because I wasn't really trying to get a job. I think that the practice that I've gotten here will help me once I am with an employer. 

00:55:20
UNKNOWN Uh-huh, okay. That's great. 

00:55:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Really working the bugs out before you have to - 

00:55:20
SHANA ELAGBRI Yeah. 

00:55:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA - go down and perform. Sure. 

00:55:25
SHANA ELAGBRI Yeah. 

00:55:25
SHIRIN VAKHARIA What about other thoughts? It sounds like practice was really helpful for everybody and working through some of that uncomfortable feeling and I think you guys can see how helpful it is to practice versus trying to do it for the first time with an, with a potential employer. So why don't you wanna make an impression with. 

00:55:40
MEGAN MARSHALL And really, sometimes it's a little bit easier when you're with an employer, because they are the expert and they have lots of information whereas the employer here was sort of, uhm, trying to find their way through. 

00:55:55
F.ROBERT WILSON The members continue talking about their experience and feelings about practicing. And then the leader changes the direction to talking about how the members can use what they have learned. 

00:56:05
FAN YE I think it's kind of hard to listen to criticism, but you know, even if its hard it really helped me to learn what to do. 

00:56:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. I think that's an excellent point then. I know for myself, listening to criticism can be really difficult, even if you knew its suppose to be helpful and some of the teaching too, it's hard to hear. But what I heard from the group today was that you really learned a lot from this process. Uhm, people are feeling more comfortable with the idea of informational interviewing, recognizing the importance of practice, uhm, getting a better idea of how to make an impression in our culture. Uhm, really working some of the bugs out before you get to the actual thing. I'm wondering if we can shift focus a little bit and talk about how you can use this information. How can you use what you've learned today? 

00:56:50
MEGAN MARSHALL Let's think about our own career and our career wishes. And maybe if each of us could think of one person who we could get some good career information from, whether it be an employer or someone that you know, uhm, who's living here in the United States that might be able to give you some really good information, uhm, and you can use the informational interview with. 

00:57:15
SHANA ELAGBRI Actually, I'm interested in international marketing. And I wanna find out what's the best way to get a job that'll take me in that direction, What I've learned is that an employer can ac-- actually tell me where to start. 

00:57:30
MEGAN MARSHALL That's a great observation. Very good. 

00:57:35
SHOU DONG FENG Ah, because so many people graduate from my field, ah, and so many people have good grades like I do, ah, so the big thing I wanted to know is, uhm, what else I can do to make myself more attractive. 

00:57:50
MEGAN MARSHALL Well, I think that's it for today. We've done all the practicing. We're gonna meet at the same time next week, and Shirin and I have arranged for us to, uhm, have a couple of real employers come in next week so that you have an opportunity to practice using the real thing. 

00:58:05
MEI TANG Uh-hmm.That's good. 

00:58:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. We'll see you next week. 

00:58:10
FAN YE Okay. 

00:58:10
MEGAN MARSHALL Good work, everyone. 

00:58:10
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:58:15
[sil.] 

00:58:20
MEGAN MARSHALL Shirin, we have, do you wanna process for a couple of minutes? 

00:58:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. 

00:58:20
MEGAN MARSHALL When this is - 

00:58:20
Processing Between Session Processing ✓transposing 

00:58:25
ROBERT K. CONYNE In addition to within-session processing, the best practice guidelines encourage leaders to process between sessions. Engaging in a regular schedule of between session processing allows the opportunity for leaders to monitor their working relationship together, to review what worked and what did not work, and to adapt future plans as is appropriate. We suggest using the Between Session Processing Model to guide these leader meetings. One such model consists of five steps titled: transpose, reflect, discover, apply and evolve. Transpose: The leaders concretely and objectively describe events and experiences without any interpretation. 

00:59:15
SHIRIN VAKHARIA The group members certainly did try hard today. I was really impressed by how people participated in the activities and seemed very willing to self-disclose. 

00:59:20
MEGAN MARSHALL They really were. I, I was really impressed. I think the things that we're asking them to do were very uncomfortable for them - 

00:59:25
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Yeah. Uh-huh. 

00:59:25
MEGAN MARSHALL - and difficult too. 

00:59:25
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. 

00:59:30
MEGAN MARSHALL It's hard to get it the first time, I think. 

00:59:30
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Oh, sure. 

00:59:30
MEGAN MARSHALL They really progressed. 

00:59:30
✓reflecting 

00:59:35
ROBERT K. CONYNE Reflect: The leaders identify and integrate sensations, feelings and awarenesses with the objective data. 

00:59:40
MEGAN MARSHALL You know Shirin, now that I'm reflecting on the group, I really felt rushed inside during the group - 

00:59:45
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-hmm. 

00:59:45
MEGAN MARSHALL - like we didn't have enough time to build on all the steps that we are ta-- trying to create. Maybe we had tackled too much information at once. 

00:59:55
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-hmm. Well, I felt really good knowing that you were there. If I had to do this alone, I don't think I would feel near as confident. 

01:00:00
MEGAN MARSHALL It's so much easier with another group leader. 

01:00:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Oh! Yeah, definitely 

01:00:05
MEGAN MARSHALL I think, yeah. 

01:00:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA I know I looked at you a couple of times trying to - 

01:00:05
MEGAN MARSHALL - trying to get the cues on where the group is. Yes - 

01:00:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Exactly. 

01:00:10
MEGAN MARSHALL - it's really nice to do that. 

01:00:10
✓discovering 

01:00:10
ROBERT K. CONYNE Discover. The leaders reflect on relevant professional literature and integrate it with objective and subjective information. 

01:00:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Remember when we were talking about the steps when designing a group. Didn't we read something about task difficulty and shaping? 

01:00:30
MEGAN MARSHALL We did, uhm, I think the other, well I think if this fits in with what we're talking about, uhm, it's always difficult I think in a psychoed group to balance the content and the process. 

01:00:40
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. 

01:00:40
MEGAN MARSHALL Uhm, I wonder if we had too much content and we did not attune to the process enough. 

01:00:45
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Right. And sometimes even if the, uhm, jumps in difficulty are small, if you have too many steps, then the process might be interrupted. 

01:00:55
MEGAN MARSHALL Right. And I think, I'm wondering if we felt that too. 

01:01:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Well, you know, we are sort of complaining about all the content pieces and that had been difficult for us. I wonder if it was difficult for the members, too. 

01:01:10
MEGAN MARSHALL I bet they were all feeling that too. 

01:01:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Yeah. 

01:01:10
MEGAN MARSHALL Yeah. 

01:01:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA It sounds like a real process. 

01:01:10
MEGAN MARSHALL So I guess maybe we need to think about that for the next session - 

01:01:15
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-hmm. 

01:01:15
MEGAN MARSHALL - especially given that we're gonna have the employers there. 

01:01:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Right. 

01:01:20
MEGAN MARSHALL So we kind of stick to one main focus in terms of contents. We have an opportunity for process. 

01:01:25
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Exactly. 

01:01:25
MEGAN MARSHALL Yeah. We have to think about that. 

01:01:25
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. I'd agree. 

01:01:25
✓applying 

01:01:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE Apply: The leaders can see their possible actions which fit with their integration of the objective, subjective, and theoretical information that has been integrating. 

01:01:40
SHIRIN VAKHARIA I think next time we really need to pay attention to how people give feedback. What else? 

01:01:45
MEGAN MARSHALL I think going back to the difficulty of the task that we talked about. I'm thinking maybe we need to run that by the group the next time we, we meet and see if the tasks are too difficult for them or if they're just right - 

01:02:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. 

01:02:00
MEGAN MARSHALL - and get some feedback on that. 

01:02:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Yeah. I agree. If we're having difficulty with it, we really need to check it out with the group. 

01:02:05
MEGAN MARSHALL Right. They'll hopefully give us the feedback. 

01:02:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. 

01:02:05
✓evolving 

01:02:10
ROBERT K. CONYNE Evolve: Over time, the leaders develop general principles of group work that can serve to guide immediate and sustain leadership practice. 

01:02:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Well Megan, I think this does it. I really value the opportunity to discuss this with you. 

01:02:25
MEGAN MARSHALL It's so important, I think, to talk about this between sessions. 

01:02:30
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Oh! Absolutely. I really value the opportunity to work with a co-leader like you and having the opportunity to process and really having good communication between us. 

01:02:40
MEGAN MARSHALL It's nice to have that honest feedback about how things are going and not have to worry about, "Is this gonna be okay with my leader?" 

01:02:45
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Oh! Yeah. 

01:02:45
MEGAN MARSHALL I feel like we're working really well together. 

01:02:45
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Well and it's so important to pick a co-- co-leader carefully. I really need to keep that in mind next time. 

01:02:50
MEGAN MARSHALL Me too. 

01:02:55
[sil.] 

01:02:55
F.ROBERT WILSON In addition to within and between session processing, leaders should conduct summative evaluation of the group using best practices in quantitative and qualitative program evaluation. We advocate an evaluation model that includes data collected from several data sources with multiple data collection instruments at various times during the planning, performing, and processing of the group. 

01:03:25
Processing Summative Evaluation ✓collecting data from multiple data resources ✓collecting data with multiple instruments ✓collecting data at multiple points during planning, performing, and formative processing ✓collecting data about the context, inputs, process, and product 

01:03:25
F.ROBERT WILSON Best practice in evaluation calls for collecting data from multiple data sources. For example, the participants, significant others and persons in a position to observe the effects of the group intervention on the participants. Collecting data with multiple data collection methodologies. For example, self-report questionnaires, interviews, informal and formal performance observations, collecting data at multiple points during the time flow planning, performing and processing. As Stufflebeam suggests, one should consider the contextual elements, the circumstances under which the group intervention is being launched. The inputs, the resources required for successful intervention and the extent to which those resources materialized. The process. The extent to which the group actually unfolded according to the plan and the extent to which the plan had to be modified on the fly. And the product. The extent to which the members were able to learn the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values targeted in the goals and objectives established for the group intervention. As we shall see, the group leaders have collected data and are now engaged in an attempt to integrated their data into a coherent statement of outcome. 

01:04:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA You know, these evaluations look really good. 

01:04:55
MEGAN MARSHALL They sure do. On all the satisfaction questions, we ranged in the good and very good. Not bad for a first try. 

01:05:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. What I'm more interested in is the ratings of performance we made during the role plays. Even though the participants all said that they felt that they can gain skill in the interviewing, we also have quite a range of skill according to our ratings. Here, look at this person. From the ratings, it looks as though we thought he was doing a bit better on how to handle western culture, but he didn't appear to gain much. 

01:05:25
MEGAN MARSHALL Well, well looks at these two. They started where he did - 

01:05:30
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. 

01:05:30
MEGAN MARSHALL - and they really gained a lot, at least from these ratings. 

01:05:35
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. So how do we reconcile these data? The satisfaction ratings, then the participants said they liked the workshops, that they learned a lot,, uhm, they would recommend it to their friends. The ratings we made of skill development though showed that members entered different levels and some gained and some didn't. 

01:05:50
MEGAN MARSHALL Have you finished rating the resumes for content and format yet? 

01:05:55
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. Yeah. It's sort of the same situation, some gained and some didn't. 

01:06:00
MEGAN MARSHALL So the objective and subjective measures don't necessarily contradict. Uhm, there's not less skill, but, uhm, they don't completely dis, they don't completely agree either. 

01:06:15
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-hmm. Yeah. I think that's what's happening. 

01:06:15
MEGAN MARSHALL Yeah. 

01:06:15
SHIRIN VAKHARIA And you know, I think having the endorsement of the head of the International Student Office, really made a big difference to. I remember at the social, she really advocated for the group and basically sent people a message that if they didn't benefit from the group it would be their own fault. 

01:06:30
MEGAN MARSHALL Right. I almost felt a little embarrassed in that group putting it on pretty thick. 

01:06:35
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-huh. Yeah. She really set up that expectation. Maybe it was a false halo. 

01:06:40
MEGAN MARSHALL Yeah. I think maybe. 

01:06:40
SHIRIN VAKHARIA It certainly helped with our sign-ups though huh? 

01:06:40
MEGAN MARSHALL Yeah. Helped us fill the group. 

01:06:45
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-hmm. 

01:06:45
F.ROBERT WILSON Certainly, the leaders will personally benefit from the careful analysis they've conducted with their data. Based on the contextually found analysis of the resources required, the process of their group and their success in achieving the outcome goal set for the group, the leaders will adjust future group offerings and grow in leadership skill. However, with increased pressure for accountability, developers or psycho educational groups may find it necessary to present their evaluation data to others in order to justify their use of budgeted money or to attract support for future psycho educational offerings. Watch now as the group leaders report to their employer about the group they have just completed. 

01:07:30
MEGAN MARSHALL Thank you for taking the time to meet with us today in person to present our report. I know this is a busy time of the year. 

01:07:35
KATLEEN ADDISON This was a really important project for us, a new outreach, and I'm, that's why I chose the two of you to do this. So naturally, I'm looking forward to seeing the results. 

01:07:45
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Great. Well, I brought along copy of the report - 

01:07:50
KATLEEN ADDISON All right! 

01:07:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA - and we also included an executive summary and we captured some of the high points and organized the report into four sections. Ah, we have an introductory section that talks about the circumstances of the project. We also included information about inputs, what resources we gathered to include in the group. We're talking about process issues as well. What happened as we started to execute the group. We also included some information about outcomes, what did the members accomplish? How did they enjoy their experience? And so forth. 

01:08:20
KATLEEN ADDISON Oh! Well let's get started. 

01:08:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

01:08:20
MEGAN MARSHALL What we were hoping to do is walk through each section individually and as questions come up, we can try to answer them. And then later well you, you could go through it thoroughly, and then we could meet again and answer any of those questions. 

01:08:35
KATLEEN ADDISON That sounds fine. 

01:08:35
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Great. 

01:08:35
MEGAN MARSHALL Well when you first gave us the project, we went and did a literature review. 

01:08:45
ROBERT K. CONYNE With the presentation of the evaluated data, the story of this psychoeducation group comes to a close. You've had the opportunity to watch as two group leaders moved through the three steps of planning, performing and processing, which are contained in the association for specialist and group works best practices guidelines. 

01:09:05
F.ROBERT WILSON Careful planning, skillful performing and systematic processing are necessary to elevate the quality of the psychoeducational offerings that are available to our community at glance. Bob and I wish you the best of luck as you plan, perform, and process your own psychoeducational groups.

Task Group Demonstration: Learning Through Discussion Robert K. Conyne, PhD Professor of Counseling F.Robert Wilson, PhD Professor of Counseling University of Cincinnati 

01:10:50
ROBERT K. CONYNE Hello and welcome to this training video on Task Groups entitled demonstration task group learning through discussion. My name is Bob Conyne and this is my colleague Bob Wilson and we are both professors of counseling at the University of Cincinnati. Over the next 90 minutes you'll have the opportunity to learn more about task groups by observing a learning through discussion group in action. 

01:11:15
F.ROBERT WILSON We develop this tape to model leading a learning through discussion group with an eye toward leading task groups in general. We have two purposes in mind in making the tape. One was to demonstrate a well functioning task group, the other was to demonstrate the leadership skills that any leader of a task group needs in order to do his or her job. Specifically we wanted to demonstrate the general skills needed in any kind of the task group, and also to demonstrate the specific skills that are necessary to be successful in leading a learning through discussion group. 

01:11:55
ROBERT K. CONYNE The training video is presented in three parts, in part one we focus upon the learning through discussion method itself, focusing on its purposes, procedures in the eight steps involved in the LTD method. Next we present the learning through discussion group, here you'll have an opportunity to watch the leader and members as they work together moving through the eight LTD steps as they accomplished their goal. Before moving to each of this steps we present awareness cues, these will help you to orient to the important leader and group behavior and events that occurred during each step. Finally upon completion of the group itself we summarize the major learnings we think you can gain through observing this video. 

01:12:40
The LTD Method ✓Checking In ✓Vocabulary Words ✓Identification of the Main Theme ✓Identification of Sub-Themes ✓Application to Other Works ✓Application to Oneself ✓Evaluation of Author's Presentation ✓Evaluation of the Group's Effort 

01:12:45
ROBERT K. CONYNE Task groups are groups formed to accomplish a task. For example to produce a product, to master a body of knowledge, to acquire a work skill. Learning through discussion is an example of a task group formed to help each of the members of the group learn the content of some authors work. For example a book or article, a movie or video, a poem, or a technical document. Learning through discussion was developed by William Fawcett Hill in 1969. And recently in 1994 an expanded third edition of Hill's book was published by Rabow, Charness, Kipperman and Radcliffe-Vasile. Learning through discussion consists of eight steps, checking in, vocabulary words, identification of the main theme, identification of sub-themes, application to other works, application to oneself, evaluation of the authors presentation, evaluation of the groups effort. In a moment we will show you a learning through discussion group in action, but before we begin we would like to point out that the learning through discussion model was developed in the United States and is based on Western Culture notions about appropriate group behavior. We are aware that the learning through discussion method may require adaptation when used among people who identify with non-western cultures. 

01:14:30
Step 1: Checking in ✓Members share feelings about being in the group today. ✓Members verify having read the author's work and having done their homework. 

01:14:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE The first step is checking in, this step ensures that all members are introduced to one another and that all members have come prepared to work. As one might doing any group the leader welcomes the members and provides orientation to the group, and describes the leadership role. As this most typical in task groups the leader also describes the work to be done in step one. To get things started the leader models the checking in process by introducing himself to the members. 

01:15:05
Checking In 

01:15:05
ROBERT K. CONYNE Now it's, uhm, every time that we could begin to - 

01:15:10
UNKNOWN Checking in. 

01:15:10
ROBERT K. CONYNE - ah, start the task today. Uhm, its good to see all of you. Uhm, and we are on our task group and our task really is to take the, ah, learning through discussion method, ah, that we know something about, and to apply it to the article that we've, ah, prepared for today. The article let me just, ah, all that here for, for our review is career needs of Chinese middle school students and implications for school guidance in the People's Republic of China, in article that appeared in a career development quarterly in December of 1991, is to, to, to strike a bill. 

01:15:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:15:45
UNKNOWN You remember this article? Oh, yes. 

01:15:45
UNKNOWN So does. 

01:15:45
ROBERT K. CONYNE Of course so the learning discussion that's it we could be applying this to really anything, any written material but this was what we're doing, uhm, today. Uhm, my job, uhm, well I try to be the facilitator of this process, uhm, I'll be trying to identify the steps, there are eight major steps to the model and to help us, uhm, interact with each other because its the group discussion and have the material that really helps us on events or learning. Maybe we could move to the very first step of the learning through discussion method, step one called the check in. And, uhm, it com-- this complies two parts first is, ah, evidencing that all of us are prepared to discuss this method, at least we've actually used the outline that we have, the preparation shading, filled it out, completed it and, ah, let's kind of, ah, check it into the group. And the second is the kind of, uhm, just say something about how we are approaching the task today? Something it be all a bit personal about, about what we bring with us to this, to this task? I'm Bob Conyne, uhm, pro-- professor to, uhm, University of Cincinnati and a counseling program of which you are all a part. So, its great to see all of you. Uhm, at, and I'm looking forward to, ah, to working with you today and seeing how the learning through discussion method can, can be helpful to us in mastering this material. Just a little bit complex in places, uhm, so I'm looking forward to it. Who'd like to go next? 

01:17:15
SHIRIN VAKHARIA I'll start it. 

01:17:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE Shirin. 

01:17:15
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uhm, I'm Shirin and I have my preparation guide, uhm, I bring my own knowledge and background to the group and I'm looking forward to hearing what other people have to say, I think am. 

01:17:25
GALE HILSON I'm Gale Hilson and, ah, its good to be here. I have my, uhm, outline for my LTD preparation and I'm just ready to start. 

01:17:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE Great. 

01:17:40
PAT SAMPLES Hello I'm Pat Samples (ph) and, uhm, I brought my outline I prepared. And I'm really feeling, ah, excited about this. 

01:17:50
HOLLY BELL I'm Holly and, uhm, I am prepared as well. And, uhm, I'm anticipating a library discussion on the article. 

01:18:00
DAVE WELSCHER I'm Dave Welscher, uhm, read this several times feel like I heard it damn pretty well and really anxious to hear what your all directions to it all. Gone pretty, also pretty excited about the discussion today. 

01:18:10
JIM HIGHTOWER My name is Jim Hightower, and, ah, I'm excited about, I'm prepared as well and I'm excited about, ah, being in this, ah, this, this discussion group. And, uhm, I'm open to learn, uhm, more about, ah, career development and hoping that this will be a very productive discussion. 

01:18:35
FAN YE Guess its my turn, I'm Fan Ye, the only Chinese in the discussion group, uhm, an article of China. I'm pretty interested that you know you're my American colleagues reactions to this Chinese culture aspects in relation to occasion let me just, thanks guys. 

01:18:50
ROBERT K. CONYNE Uh-hmm. Thank you. Any one else, ah? 

01:18:55
JACKIE SMITH Yeah. 

01:18:55
ROBERT K. CONYNE Yeah, sure. 

01:18:55
JACKIE SMITH Uhm, I'm Jackie Smith and I brought the outline that I've written on front and back so, uhm, needless to say I'm was really interested in the article - 

01:19:05
ROBERT K. CONYNE Oh. 

01:19:10
UNKNOWN - that, and I'm really much before to hear how are the people interpreted the material. 

01:19:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE Oh. 

01:19:15
RON SPRAGUE My name is Ron Sprague, ah, I have my, my materials with me also, uhm, I'm very excited about being in this, ah, discussion group today. I been looking forward to it for quite some time. 

01:19:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE All right. Is there everyone else? Well, wonderful it sounds like there is, uhm, a lot of excitement and the article, ah, was compelling in lots of ways. 

01:19:40
Step 2 Vocabulary Words ✓members identify and define difficult vocabulary words 

01:19:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE The second step is vocabulary. In this step the members identify and define difficult vocabulary words, the leader orients the members to the workers step two and sets a time limit. Through out the segment the leader models asking for definitions of terms and uses both open ended questions and encouraging to stimulate participation. Note that the leader highlights the unique contribution of the Asian member of the group. 

01:20:10
Vocabulary Words 

01:20:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE Uhm, step two in the, uhm, learning through discussion method is vocabulary, defining terms, defining concepts, uhm, its always a kind of, ah, ah, brief set maybe, ah, three or four minutes or so. Uhm, but it's nice to try to get that some things which maybe confusing, ah, like that, ah, hear from other people about what something might have met-- meant. I'll start off, I, I notice in the article that, uhm, there were in the couple of places, uhm, uhm, I thought kind of confusing, uhm, presentations about, about data, uhm, it excuse me - 

01:20:55
HOLLY BELL Yeah. 

01:20:55
ROBERT K. CONYNE - had a lot, I'm taking really at table three, three and four, ah, from there, uhm, and yet when I look at it and thought through my, my thinking was, ah, maybe didn't really sufficiently or significantly affect the main pieces of what, ah, the authors were trying to convey, ah, but, ah, but I wanted to just surface this now and check that review to see along the same page with this. 

01:21:20
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

01:21:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE Okay, good. 

01:21:20
UNKNOWN Yes, done. 

01:21:25
ROBERT K. CONYNE This having sort of, ah, does anybody have any, uhm, any terms or concepts or whatever that you like to, ah, get some clarification about as possible here. 

01:21:35
UNKNOWN Yes, uhm, those the term and I'm not real sure how to pronounce it, "danwei" I think it was and, ah, they define it as the basic community unit of China but I wasn't sure if it was important person, a place or an organization. 

01:21:50
FAN YE Its an organization, the place you work. 

01:21:50
UNKNOWN Oh, okay. 

01:21:55
FAN YE Yes, say Dr. Conyne is working as a professor in this University, this is your danwei. 

01:22:00
UNKNOWN Danwei, okay. Thank you. 

01:22:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE Danwei. 

01:22:00
FAN YE Danwei. 

01:22:05
ROBERT K. CONYNE The University of Cincinnati is my Danwei. 

01:22:05
UNKNOWN Yes, that's right. 

01:22:05
ROBERT K. CONYNE It could have be, would have be, uhm, your danwei also all of yours and because you're a students here? 

01:22:10
FAN YE No has to be your import(ph). 

01:22:10
ROBERT K. CONYNE Import(ph), okay. 

01:22:15
FAN YE Okay. 

01:22:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE Good, all right. 

01:22:15
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:22:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE That's probably something that maybe only Fan Ye could have help us with, I don't, I don't-- Thank you for bringing that up. Uhm, in-- is there anything else? 

01:22:25
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Well, you know what, well I thought what was really interesting in sort of let me think about it when Fan mentioned, uhm, the, the, ah, basic unit. Well actually what I like about the article was where the author balanced out the culture with specific means this to, I think he did it all the job or, they I just thought some authors balancing out. 

01:22:45
ROBERT K. CONYNE I've, I, I-- just an idea here. Gonna like to try off. I like what you're, uhm, your, your surfacing for us to look at, Shirin, but, ah, but I'm wondering if that, ah, could be more helpful to us right now at least well we're looking at vocabulary and trying to understand terms that maybe confusing to just try to stay at vocabulary before we move on to that particular issue? 

01:23:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

01:23:05
ROBERT K. CONYNE We hold off on that? 

01:23:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-hmm. 

01:23:10
ROBERT K. CONYNE And maybe you can remember, ah, to, to bring it back in a little bit later. 

01:23:15
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Okay. 

01:23:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE Is that okay? 

01:23:15
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-hmm. 

01:23:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE Thank you. We're still at, ah, vocabulary about this, is there anything else that, uhm, you need clarification on or are you all set? 

01:23:25
DAVE WELSCHER I was just curious I guess more than anything if anyone thought that Chinese pragmatism had a different spend to what my concept of pragmatic, being pragmatic is, uhm, I guess once again you're-- seems the only one that could possibly answers this unless there some special now that know about. 

01:23:45
FAN YE Well... 

01:23:45
ROBERT K. CONYNE Well what's? My question what's your notion of, ah, pragmatic? 

01:23:45
DAVE WELSCHER Pragmatic just being, uhm, using another word practical or being, its used for what its designed for. 

01:23:55
ROBERT K. CONYNE Okay. 

01:23:55
FAN YE Uh-hmm. I think close, its like adapting a basic referring concept to the Chinese situation. Applying what is feasible to China. 

01:24:05
UNKNOWN Okay so, its basically the same thing. 

01:24:05
FAN YE Yes. 

01:24:05
UNKNOWN Okay, that's fine. 

01:24:10
Step 3 Identification of Main Theme ✓Members identify the author's main theme 

01:24:15
F.ROBERT WILSON The third step is identification of the authors main theme. Stating the authors main theme in ones own word is critical to the LTD method of learning. After orienting the members to the goal and the time limit for this step the leaders works to get each member to identify the authors main theme. The leader encourages member involvement by asking members to identify connections with one another's contributions and spreads responsibility among the members by using their summarizations. Note that the leader prevents a member from jumping ahead to a later step before the work of this step is complete. 

01:24:50
Main Theme 

01:24:55
ROBERT K. CONYNE Step three, uhm, in the learning through discussion model is called the general statement of the authors message. This is like the big picture, that big theme. It's amazing discussion groups, ah, members kind of go immediately to talking about their own big theme, their own ideas about this topic before understanding what the authors have trying to say. In this, in this method it's important to try the first come to groups of what the authors had to say, so, uhm, we've got, ah, five or six minutes or so allocated to try to understand this and ma-- maybe generally agree on a big picture sort of notion of the authors message. Yet you may have different ideas of what that was as you read it, ah, who would like to, uhm, start off and, ah, sharing what you saw the authors trying to say. Go on Gail. 

01:25:50
GALE HILSON And you so-- ah, thank you. I thought that the authors message was, ah, démarche toward modernization. And I do believe that he took this margin for prospects, ah, which where agriculture, ah, defense, uhm, science and industry but I was before, ah, career assessing of Chinese middle school children is actually the one that really took off. So that's what I was thinking that the authors message was the actually taking off of career assessment. 

01:26:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE By taking off you mean - 

01:26:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm, successful emphasizing - 

01:26:35
ROBERT K. CONYNE - emphasizing, really? 

01:26:35
UNKNOWN - and it is now you can see that it's going somewhere. 

01:26:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE Oh, thank you. Ha-- how does that connect with any other, ah, perceptions of the main theme of the authors here? 

01:26:45
SHIRIN VAKHARIA I thought, ah, similar to what Gail said is, is how the changing political climate in China is opening up opportunities for people and, and a pa-- a part of that is implementing career guidance programs - 

01:27:00
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:27:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA - for middle s-- middle school children is now they may have a choice as to what career they wanna go into. 

01:27:05
UNKNOWN Well its really strange because that's, that's checks occurred at me because a career goal in mind is to be, ah, a career counselor. 

01:27:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-hmm. 

01:27:15
HOLLY BELL And the-- this article provide us some really info-- you know, important information for me and, uhm, things that I should be aware off that, that are, that go along with, uhm, the Chinese culture. 

01:27:25
ROBERT K. CONYNE Holly Bell, uhm, this has a lot of personal meaning for you. 

01:27:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:27:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE This whole thing. Uhm, that's great, uhm, we'll, we'll have a spot a little bit late in, uhm, you know, the learning through discussion method where we really focused on personal applications to, to talk more about that kind of emphasis. 

01:27:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:27:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE - what these ideas mean for each one of us so, I want you hold on to that. 

01:27:45
UNKNOWN Sure. 

01:27:45
ROBERT K. CONYNE Getting to that, ah, a little bit later, thank you. Uhm, I both ah, and I been taking notes to try - 

01:27:50
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:27:50
ROBERT K. CONYNE - remember what you, what you are, what you're saying is main, main themes. Gail ensuring of both identified, ah, si-- similar kind of, ah, idea career, career guidance for middles school students opportunities, ah, opening up within China. 

01:28:05
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:28:05
ROBERT K. CONYNE And the authors really emphasizing this whole, uhm, approach, ah, here. Is there anything, uhm, different or additive that anyone, any of you would like to, ah, suggest? Is that generally covered Dave? 

01:28:25
DAVE WELSCHER I think they are both right and they're both very similar but I think Shirin has something real important to change aspect. And then what I heard you saying was kind of a need aspect and those are both things that are kinda write and written down and read it so, I make sure reading. 

01:28:35
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-hmm, yeah. 

01:28:35
DAVE WELSCHER Uhm, giving that People's Republic of China's current economic and political situation there is a tremendous need for culturally relevant career guidance in the schools. 

01:28:45
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:28:45
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:28:45
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:28:45
ROBERT K. CONYNE Well, Dave I see a lot of head nods. Ah, this is, ah, mean that, ah, his summarization, ah, strikes a cord that make sense. 

01:28:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:29:00
UNKNOWN Yes, he does, he does. 

01:29:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:29:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE Could you, could you say it one more time? 

01:29:00
DAVE WELSCHER Sure. 

01:29:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE This is important. 

01:29:00
DAVE WELSCHER Uhm, given the People's Republic of China's current economic and political situation, there is a tremendous need for culturally relevant career guidance in the schools. 

01:29:10
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:29:10
ROBERT K. CONYNE I like that really things in the cultural aspect. 

01:29:15
UNKNOWN Yes it does. 

01:29:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. Important 

01:29:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE Important. So shall we, uhm, accept this, uhm, as, as the main theme as we understand it and then, uhm, and then explore that main theme? 

01:29:25
Step 4 Identification of Sub-Themes ✓Members identify major sub-themes in the author's work ✓Members discuss the meaning of each major sub-theme 

01:29:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE The fourth step is discussion of the authors sub-topics. After orienting the members the leader encourages participation with both verbal and non-verbal encouragers using eye gaze open ended question and summarizations to keep the discussion moving. Once again the leader blocks jumping ahead to make sure the work of this step is completed, note that to where the end of step four discussion is flowing so well that the group resists the leaders attempt to close off discussion and move to the next step. 

01:30:00
Sub-Themes 

01:30:05
ROBERT K. CONYNE Step four of the learning through discussion, ah, method. And this is examination of major sub-topics. 

01:30:10
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:30:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE Sub-themes in a way, little or smaller pictures have fall within this over our chain, ah, of picture of that the office had described. Uhm, as there was a lot covered in the article as you probably all remember. Now, now well spend ten to 12 minutes maybe, uhm, hearing, ah, what each of you or some of you saw may-- ah, in a major sub-themes under this larger, ah, organization. And then we'll try and maybe, ah, uhm, ah, so select one or two for discussion. Okay. Who would like to, ah, to begin this step? 

01:30:50
RON SPRAGUE I saw one of sub-theme as, uhm, ah, the career guidance program is seen as a benefit to China it self, ah, by being able to optimize the, ah, the skills that the students will have, ah, lets say cause he enjoyed graduation and they could be used in the workforce in a much, ah, more efficient manner. 

01:31:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE The an-- hmm, excuse me, ah, benefit in the work force and other kinds of, yes, positives that, ah, trying to get realized. Good. 

01:31:25
HOLLY BELL Also, uhm, I think one of the major theme was, was, uhm, that the guidance program that they are proposing, uhm, for, for, uhm, Chinese students would actually taken to account, the one that would taken to account the political structure and system, uhm, this is something that are going to be sensitive of developing again this program in China. Ah, so, uhm, right, yeah, and I think, ah, its, its different major-theme in the article. 

01:31:50
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:31:50
FAN YE I agree and just picking, uhm, picking up to your point. I think he also points out the main obstacles in launching a (inaudible ). 

01:32:01
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:32:01
ROBERT K. CONYNE Right. Good. I like the way you're referring to the outlines, ah, preparation its very useful. 

01:32:10
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:32:10
ROBERT K. CONYNE Especially with the kind of complicated article like this. Is there maybe one other, uhm, ah, sub-theme anyone would like to nominate here? 

01:32:15
PAT SAMPLES I think it ties on what both what Holly Bell and, and you are saying, Tim about, uhm, the, the implications that it imply-- what, what did implies about the educational system and about the needs, uhm, and how they might start by just matching as, as one have had said. But the implications for the country is they begin to try and do this (inaudible ). 

01:32:45
ROBERT K. CONYNE Good, there's, there's ain't, ah, representing a good sampling do you think, of, ah, as one of major sub-themes that were addressed by the authors. Uhm, talking about career guidance, ah, and its, ah, practical benefits, ah, that trying to may be able to realize, ah, taking in to accounts some politicals and cultural factors as they relate to thinking about and approaching career guidance within, ah, within China. Some of the, uhm, obstacles, ah, the, the challenges that, that face, ah, ah, this country and the people as it begin to move in this direction maybe and finally, uhm, relate to that same implications, ah, that, that stem from this. Suppose to me that's a good sample, no. Uhm, where would you like to, uhm, begin because we have in discussion of any of this. Uhm, a few minutes really to explore one or two perhaps. 

01:33:40
SHIRIN VAKHARIA I think the challenges that the Chinese people then of facing and permitting a program like this probably be something that needs to be de-- we needs to spend some time on because it seem to be, seem too big in the article. 

01:33:55
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:33:55
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:34:00
PAT SAMPLES Yeah, spending off that, ah, it was interesting how many differences that will pointed out between the different students - 

01:34:05
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:34:10
PAT SAMPLES - when they well prop-- presenting the data but it also struck me how there were lots of similarities as well - 

01:34:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:34:15
PAT SAMPLES - and one that's kinda stuck out for me was looking at the age of students in a seven to nine years and that they were, uhm, the evidence were saying that they depended a lot in their parents and their interest was in that, their process based on interest. 

01:34:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:34:30
PAT SAMPLES And, ah, and that sort of thing and I thought, yeah, that fits for a seven and nine year old whether they are in Canada or United States, or, you know, wherever. 

01:34:35
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:34:35
PAT SAMPLES So... 

01:34:40
FAN YE Pat, ah, did I hear you say that seven to nine year old? 

01:34:40
PAT SAMPLES Uh-hmm. 

01:34:40
FAN YE I think they also said seventh to ninth grades. And so, if they are middle school - 

01:34:45
PAT SAMPLES Oh! 

01:34:45
FAN YE - children that means high school kids. 

01:34:50
PAT SAMPLES Okay. 

01:34:50
FAN YE Ah, the age range will be 13 to fo-- 15. 

01:34:55
PAT SAMPLES Oh, okay, so more like our - 

01:34:55
FAN YE Junior high. 

01:34:55
PAT SAMPLES - our junior high. 

01:34:55
FAN YE Junior high, yes. 

01:35:00
PAT SAMPLES Well, that certainly changes things. 

01:35:00
UNKNOWN It does. 

01:35:00
UNKNOWN Thank you (inaudible ). 

01:35:05
FAN YE You're welcome. 

01:35:05
ROBERT K. CONYNE That's different. 

01:35:05
UNKNOWN It go out, really. 

01:35:10
ROBERT K. CONYNE Just a, a process comment seems that, uhm, this really illustrates how a group discussion can be promotive of learning. 

01:35:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:35:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:35:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE Because I mean, I didn't pick that up myself, I'm embarrassed to say and thank you for that, uhm... 

01:35:25
PAT SAMPLES Gonna changes on of you the whole article. 

01:35:25
RON SPRAGUE Yeah, yeah, okay. I think, I think that's, ah, that's an important thing, ah, we are sitting here assuming that, ah, middle school for those of us, ah, in, in the United States that middle school is, ah, aged seven to nine and its, its not high school, ah, as it is in China. And I'm making an assumption then many of the programs that we have here in United States in career guidance will not, ah, directly transpose to China. 

01:35:55
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:35:55
RON SPRAGUE And, and in this article I think they, ah, they point out the fact that there are some modifications that are going to had to be made. 

01:36:00
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:36:00
RON SPRAGUE And they are reaching out to other cultures if you will and making this modifications and bringing them in. 

01:36:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:36:05
ROBERT K. CONYNE We are talking still about challenges being faced and then like - 

01:36:10
UNKNOWN Implications. 

01:36:10
ROBERT K. CONYNE - and implications, yeah. Yeah, any, any other, ah, challenges or implications? Yeah. 

01:36:15
JIM HIGHTOWER You think that's consistent with, uhm, an article that I receive from Dr. Conyne, ah, about the a precursors of vocational psychology in ancient civilization, and the authors, ah, indicated that an aspects of career guidance has been, ah, the Eastern and Western, ah, civilization system, ah, first millennian. And they talked about, ah, that, ah, in developing a career guidance program, ah, certain things should be focused on such as matching a person with the, ah, environment, ah, having a compatibility with the two, as well as, uhm, ah, providing the individual with the knowledge to enhance his, his, ah, abilities and, ah, pass to those to together. Uhm, the author use, uhm, several philosophers to, ah, support his argument, ah, and he has western philosophers as well as, ah, ah, ea-- eastern philosophers. And he talks about, uhm, ah, Confucius and Lazlo and he felt that an integration of the two philosophers would be the best because, ah, ah, even though, ah, Lazlo will not, ah, what a plan, plan flow and development but, ah, he felt that, ah, a plan for deve-- program development would be necessary. 

01:37:50
ROBERT K. CONYNE Tim I wonder if, uhm, this is something that, uhm, we might be able to dealt into a little more deeply, ah, when we look at relationship of this article to other works. 

01:38:00
JIM HIGHTOWER Okay. 

01:38:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE Uhm, this right-- actually the next step. That's an exciting, uhm, that's an exciting article, ah, I'd like that very much in how it connects - 

01:38:10
JIM HIGHTOWER Okay. 

01:38:10
ROBERT K. CONYNE - as well. Thank you. Uhm, a-- any more, uhm, challenges, ah, implications that you'd like to, ah, surface here. 

01:38:20
UNKNOWN Initially what I'd like to share. 

01:38:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE Sure. 

01:38:20
GALE HILSON Well I would like to actually piggyback on what, what have shared with this, uhm, such as with the political conditions to cultural society and experiences to Chinese and adapting career guidance, I think all of this is going to be affected, all of this is going, ah, have a big effect actually on the making of the career assessment. 

01:38:45
ROBERT K. CONYNE Uh-hmm. 

01:38:45
GALE HILSON Uh-hmm, uh-hmm. And, ah, what the environment as it is, ah, the Chinese educators definition of career guidance it's gonna have to be actually related to but political and culture and, ah, career guidance definition. 

01:39:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE This is very consistent, ah, I guess with, ah, all that we are studying and learning about multicultural issues. 

01:39:05
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:39:05
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:39:05
ROBERT K. CONYNE And, and, and how to try to make connections between one culture and another. 

01:39:10
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

01:39:10
ROBERT K. CONYNE Remember there is a discussion here about the dictionary of occupational titles of the LTD. 

01:39:20
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:39:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE We have here in this country, and translation is necessary with the Chinese - 

01:39:25
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:39:25
ROBERT K. CONYNE - society. Good. Ah, any, any, uhm, any other things. Oh! 

01:39:25
FAN YE Yeah, I think there are some practical considerations as well like launching a career guidance program in China would involve radically changes maybe in some areas like co-- curriculums, syllabus, teacher training - 

01:39:40
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:39:40
FAN YE - and, ah, entrance, university entrance exam system, and so - 

01:39:45
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:39:50
FAN YE - this would be a lot of work. 

01:39:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA That, that something that really struck too often because - 

01:39:55
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-hmm. 

01:39:55
SHIRIN VAKHARIA - just the resource issue phenomenal they don't have school counci-- there are no school counselors saying who would do this? The training that would be need to pro-- need to be invited to whom ever, what im-- want a program like this, uhm, just the materials or something that they don't have and then it sounded like - 

01:40:10
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:40:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA - the, the opportunity for kids to grow from whatever ask maybe six grade to that seventh grade seem competitive anyway that not a lot of people had that opportunity to go on. 

01:40:20
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:40:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Because that would be a challenge also. 

01:40:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:40:25
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:40:25
DAVE WELSCHER I thought one further challenge that kinda struck me after I read at the se-- as I was reading at the second time was that I was thinking about what you were just saying the - 

01:40:35
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Hmm. 

01:40:35
DAVE WELSCHER - the, the logistics have been employing a new program the training and everything. But what about at the students? 

01:40:40
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-hmm. 

01:40:40
DAVE WELSCHER I'm, I'm thinking, how exciting it would be to, you know, develop some choice and some interest which they had in the past but how scary that would also be? 

01:40:45
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:40:45
DAVE WELSCHER Is it basically guinea pigs in an experiment. 

01:40:50
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:40:50
DAVE WELSCHER You know the, the first of their kind the have no one to ask or how did you react? You know, they can't ask the older brother or sister cuz they've-- they don't have the same experience. 

01:40:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:41:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE Uh-hmm. 

01:41:00
DAVE WELSCHER How exciting but also scary, that, that must be done. 

01:41:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Right, and I wonder how, uhm, the parental issue place into that because it sounds like the parents play big influence in on where their kids go and that sort of thing and that sense of respect and how receptive they might be to program. 

01:41:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE We, we've got to follow then that another minute or so maybe to, ah, dis-- to, to spend on this discussion part which is very important part of this of course. 

01:41:25
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:41:25
ROBERT K. CONYNE Is there anyone who, uhm, last you got into this, this days who would like to say anything, ah, at this point? 

01:41:30
UNKNOWN I was just - 

01:41:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE Yeah. 

01:41:35
JACKIE SMITH - uhm, I have, ah, entire agreement with, with what Dave and Shirin was sharing and, uhm, and I was thinking not only, uhm, is the challenge going to be, uhm, this students being able to find parental support but just, uhm, societal support - 

01:41:45
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:41:50
JACKIE SMITH - uhm, support from the administrators who have, you know, come up under a different kind of educational system and whether those gonna be enough support there to really augment they're wanting to seek career guidance. 

01:42:00
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:42:00
UNKNOWN Right, and really set up expectations, uhm, that won't be supported. 

01:42:05
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:42:10
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:42:10
HOLLY BELL Also since, and since the, uhm, the article talks about guidance program that would promote self-exploration this is something that Chinese students may not necessarily engage in other regular, I mean, they may not be, be up for those. 

01:42:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:42:20
HOLLY BELL So that's another... 

01:42:25
PAT SAMPLES A lot of those strange things that been involved in. 

01:42:25
ROBERT K. CONYNE And it strikes me that we really, ah, and that a lot of this article. 

01:42:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:42:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE You know, identifying many of the, the major, ah, challenges and excitements and, and, and obstacles that, that I was noting as well and its, ah, it's a big task, ah, being faced, you know, exciting one that, ah, as well. 

01:42:40
JIM HIGHTOWER You know, that, ah, strikes-- it may strikes some up few I think that, that cut also, ah, ah, the students have also indicated that there is a need for career, career development and a plan for career development. 

01:42:55
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:42:55
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:42:55
ROBERT K. CONYNE Well that sounds if we could, ah, bridge to the next, ah, step in the learning through discussion method. 

01:43:00
Step 5. Application to Other works ✓Members create ties between the information contained in the author's work and ideas or concepts learned in the other contexts. 

01:43:05
F.ROBERT WILSON The fifth step is application of the authors work to other works. In this step the group will attempt to connect the authors work to learnings from other settings, the leader orients the group to the purpose and time constraints of this step. Again open ended questions and summarizations facilitate the flow of discussion. Distributed leadership emerges with members participating in their own group facilitation. (inaudible ) are made to the works of Confucius, Lao-tzu, Aristotle, Holland(ph), Super and Trait and Factor Theory. Member involvement is strong closing off discussion proves to be difficult. 

01:43:50
Application to Other Works 

01:43:55
ROBERT K. CONYNE This is, ah, step five, uhm, the, ah, connection with, uhm, related material, all the things that you've read. Jim was starting to share some of those, uhm, I'm sure all those that you have, ah, ideas about this is, well this is very important to see how this body of information connects with or, or doesn't with others that your aware, we are or you talk some of that multi-culture issues first. But, uhm, we've got, uhm, 15 minutes or so to, to try to connect these isolated pieces of informations. So, so something we can do with this. Uhm, who would like to, ah... 

01:44:30
FAN YE Let me jump in. 

01:44:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE Oh, good. 

01:44:30
FAN YE All right. 

01:44:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE Okay. 

01:44:30
FAN YE Because me too I read the same article as you did that Precursors of, uhm, ah, Vocational Psychology in Ancient Civilizations and, ah, its just like your growing up accepting all this concepts without questioning their origin. And I think that you too may feel kind of strange to hear a concept something like, uhm, assigning people to different post rather than giving them free choices. And I kept wondering too about where this concept actually came from. And I've discovered in this article and I think its basically based on the Confucius idea of what best the choice of vocation should be. And according to him the best vocation, vocational choice should be made by the state and the state should assign people who are relatively talented, uhm, to the different structure of needs within this, we all planned, centrally planned date. 

01:45:35
ROBERT K. CONYNE Uh-hmm. 

01:45:35
FAN YE And, and I, I don't what it should like, uhm, anything in this article. 

01:45:40
GALE HILSON Uh-hmm. Okay, yes it does. Thank you Fan Ye. 

01:45:45
JIM HIGHTOWER Ah, the other side of that, ah, is, ah, ah, well so, uhm, to advocates that, uhm, the individual differences of an individual and that the transcend things that change on a daily basis, ah, and Aristotle go along with that cuz in the, ah, and he, he is in another philosophy that was-- ah, philosophy that was used and he is consistent with, ah, that view that people should, should, ah, have a n opportunity to select, ah, create an opportunities rather than, and, ah, start of with, uhm, but you might call inequalities and question that direction. 

01:46:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:46:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE It sounds like that's a rich article, literature, ah? 

01:46:30
DAVE WELSCHER Should add. 

01:46:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE Yeah. 

01:46:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:46:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE Anyone else? 

01:46:35
HOLLY BELL Well I say I read an article, uhm, it was talking about the career guidance programs employed in, in, you know, United States and how it is, its-- they, they are evolving from a, uhm, a traits and, uhm, environment, uhm, situation where they, they career counselors tried to match the persons personality with the work environments to make it a perfect match. 

01:46:55
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:46:55
HOLLY BELL And also grabbing to more where they are trying to take into consideration dynamic things going on within the person with in the environment trying to, uhm, actually get the persons have dealt deep inside themselves and look at the work environment to look at things that might be changing and to actually put the, uhm, the workers are control in the person. 

01:47:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:47:15
HOLLY BELL And for a Chinese student to actually look at their choices and see there are so many choices available, it's, it's probably has to so-- you know implications for program in China,, you know, Chinese education(ph). 

01:47:25
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:47:25
ROBERT K. CONYNE Very, very interesting. 

01:47:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE Yeah. 

01:47:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:47:30
JIM HIGHTOWER And I think that's, ah, consistent but, ah, Holland's topology well that, ah, you as individual personalities and try to match them with the environmental personalities. 

01:47:40
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:47:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:47:45
ROBERT K. CONYNE Make it out of, make it out of their ability. 

01:47:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:47:45
ROBERT K. CONYNE Anyone else have anything to add, ah, from what you been studying? 

01:47:50
PAT SAMPLES Well, I also just in reading the, the data I'm looking at the data noticed that, uhm, in very much there was a, uhm, to me a similarity between Donald Super's developmental model. 

01:48:05
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:48:05
PAT SAMPLES Uhm, and, and the, the data's that was collected on the Chinese students. 

01:48:10
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:48:10
PAT SAMPLES That they, ah, certainly were early developmental stage that was similar to what he describes. 

01:48:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE Hmm. 

01:48:15
PAT SAMPLES In the western. 

01:48:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:48:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE Uh-hmm. 

01:48:20
JACKIE SMITH Excuse me, I done some reading about, uhm, just some of the multicultural issues - 

01:48:25
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:48:25
JACKIE SMITH - that are involved in, in, uhm, career guidance and career counseling. And one of the things that, that I was reminding, ah, reminded of was that, uhm, there can be a lot of stereotypic gui-- ah, guiding - 

01:48:35
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:48:40
JACKIE SMITH - and a lot of bias. 

01:48:40
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:48:40
JACKIE SMITH Uhm, uhm, especially here in our culture we look at some, some genders theory and some gender bias, those kinds of things, uhm, and I was wondering, you know, how that issue would play out in the Chinese culture? 

01:48:55
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:48:55
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:48:55
UNKNOWN Good question. 

01:48:55
UNKNOWN Good issue. 

01:48:55
DAVE WELSCHER If you take on of that, ah, because we have that stereotypical kind of view with the programs we develop four career guidance that the Chinese culture may be looking to adapt from have that stereotype. 

01:49:10
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

01:49:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:49:10
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:49:10
DAVE WELSCHER And well then from really, its not really evident - 

01:49:10
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:49:10
DAVE WELSCHER - in, in the surface but when you're using in and it just kind of flow that way. 

01:49:15
JACKIE SMITH Uh-hmm. 

01:49:15
DAVE WELSCHER It says in one thing within the work at, you know, and. 

01:49:20
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:49:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:49:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE Just the process, ah, I wish I could make it real briefly that we're having quite a bit of discussion across numbers talking with each other quite a bit and Shirin very readily your knowledge in and I think this is very useful. 

01:49:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:49:30
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

01:49:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE Very nice. 

01:49:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:49:35
ROBERT K. CONYNE Go ahead. 

01:49:35
SHIRIN VAKHARIA I was just gonna jump in with you guys also lately it seems like in the literature in career development we're making more of, ah, a push to account for cultural issues and that sort of thing. Ah, which very much applies to what the Chinese people are trying to do where they not only adapt the person but also the culture or take that into account in, in career choice and that sort of thing. 

01:49:55
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

01:49:55
RON SPRAGUE Yeah, Shirin we could see that also in a way that, ah, Chinese government is trying to handle this situation, ah, what they want to do is take an active role and, ah, actually, ah, look at the compatibility of careers and try to guide the students in that direction as opposed to, ah, just letting them have the, their own choice, ah, as they're going to their, ah, situation. I realized in study, ah, that I've read, ah, indicates that, ah, the, the Chinese, ah, as a client if you will in this country well prefers the, ah, action oriented, ah, authoritative approach to future decisions that they will make. And this fits in culturally with, ah, with what the government is trying to do and with the, ah, with the process of career development. 

01:50:40
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:50:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE It's an interesting connections, so is your reading had more to do I suspect with, ah, the individual counseling kind of literature? 

01:50:45
RON SPRAGUE Right, right, it's, ah, it's more of, ah, our counseling situation here but it, ah, it, it deals with the, ah, if, if you will the, this like, you know, the Chinese - 

01:50:55
ROBERT K. CONYNE Uh-hmm. 

01:50:55
RON SPRAGUE - ah, American I think. 

01:50:55
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:50:55
ROBERT K. CONYNE Interesting. Yeah. Good. You'd been doing some readings and making some connections. Is there anything else that, uhm, hasn't been, ah, shared that you, you're aware of that relates to this material? 

01:51:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA The only thing that, that I can think of not just, I was just reviewing my outline, uhm, that I'm thinking about is in, in career development as we know it is an emphasis on that life span development and career development sort of thing, and I didn't get that feeling from the, from the article cause it sounded like it was just this one age group. 

01:51:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE Uh-hmm. 

01:51:30
SHIRIN VAKHARIA And I'm wondering how (inaudible ) theory as we know, ah, over the lifespan would applied to lifespan development and that sort of thing, on the Chinese people. 

01:51:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE Uh-hmm. 

01:51:40
UNKNOWN A long way to come... 

01:51:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:51:42
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Yeah. 

01:51:42
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:51:42
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Which might be down the road, I mean this is all near or so. 

01:51:45
JACKIE SMITH I thought about that too Shirin and I though, uhm, developmentally, you know, we start it all with trait and factor theory. 

01:51:50
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:51:50
JACKIE SMITH And looking at their definition of what career guidance is it but looks like that, that's where they are now. And that if this is a developmental process, uhm, one of the things that they're gonna eventually begin to look at is lifestyles. 

01:52:05
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:52:05
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:52:05
JACKIE SMITH And life tasks. 

01:52:05
FAN YE Hmm, so as... 

01:52:10
RON SPRAGUE Yeah, I think... 

01:52:10
FAN YE Uh-hmm. Yes. 

01:52:10
RON SPRAGUE Hmm, sorry Fan. I, I think here in the state of Ohio, uhm, ah, they have a program now where, ah, children in all grades, ah, from, ah, first grade I believe or Kindergarten and up will be, uhm, will consider and start looking at things that are, ah, related to career choices in the future. 

01:52:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:52:30
RON SPRAGUE Ah, and it's a, it's a systematic program that takes place, ah, every year and they have a certain, ah, define levels of understanding of career - 

01:52:40
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:52:40
RON SPRAGUE - for, for the children. 

01:52:40
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:52:40
RON SPRAGUE And, ah, this maybe, ah, I, I notice in the article they were trying to decide whether not to implement this career guidance in, ah, in the curriculum itself or train people to take care of it. 

01:52:50
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:52:50
ROBERT K. CONYNE Okay. 

01:52:50
RON SPRAGUE Its, it will take many years for this to, ah - 

01:52:55
UNKNOWN Correct, correct. 

01:52:55
RON SPRAGUE - for this process to function to surface. 

01:52:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:52:55
PAT SAMPLES Yeah, yeah, then for ever to get to, ah, developmental age of, you know, elementary or first level primarily. 

01:53:05
JACKIE SMITH Yeah. 

01:53:05
DAVE WELSCHER And expecting anything else other than it taking some time - 

01:53:05
RON SPRAGUE Right. 

01:53:05
DAVE WELSCHER - is kind of foolish. 

01:53:05
JACKIE SMITH Right. 

01:53:05
DAVE WELSCHER And can set up some false hopes and some disappointments to expected to be working right away, up and earning. 

01:53:15
JACKIE SMITH Right. 

01:53:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:53:15
JACKIE SMITH And can I just tag ride on to it they was telling you to about failed(ph) hope with-- and expectations. One of the things that I thought too was developmentally when you start looking at career guidance and caree-- career exploration. What that does is it brings us some other theories about career adjustment and work adjustment. 

01:53:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:53:30
JACKIE SMITH And what happens to those adults and those people in society - 

01:53:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:53:35
JACKIE SMITH - who now are looking at, at, you know, the generation behind them is doing some explorations and what are not really comfortable with my job and I'm not really comfortable, you know, what, what I'm doing. 

01:53:45
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:53:45
JACKIE SMITH And if the Chinese society or culture is ready to look at work adjustment issues. 

01:53:55
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:53:55
FAN YE Just following Jackie Smith 's point and also I think Ryan and Shirin too. That reminds me somehow of how limited our choices as to you. Looking at SDS Self Directed Search the booklet on vocation occupational code and so on. I was really impressed because just we are not aware there such a variety of occupations that we could choose from. 

01:54:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:54:15
JACKIE SMITH Uh-hmm. 

01:54:15
FAN YE That's the situation of China basically. 

01:54:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE Hmm. Anyone else, uhm, wanna get in on this before we-- I try to well summarize the most, some of what we been talking about to move, move on to, ah, on that case. 

01:54:35
RON SPRAGUE I just, ah, I just have one comment and listening to some of the things that had been said it's, ah, it sounds like, ah, career wise where also the Chinese are also re-- going to redefine success and failure in the work place. 

01:54:50
JACKIE SMITH Uh-hmm. 

01:54:50
RON SPRAGUE And it goes with what Jackie Smith has said. 

01:54:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:54:50
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:54:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:54:55
RON SPRAGUE Ah, which is could have a tremendous impact on, on the culture. 

01:54:55
ROBERT K. CONYNE Yes. I tried to... 

01:55:00
GALE HILSON I thought. 

01:55:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE Yeah, go ahead Gail. 

01:55:00
GALE HILSON Oh, I'm sorry but I thought the author sis saying also that, ah, through all this adaptiveness, ah, the individuals with having choice, ah, being offered career assessment we're talking what power and we're talking about economical growth. 

01:55:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:55:15
GALE HILSON And this is what it almost down to for each individual. 

01:55:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE Hmm. 

01:55:20
GALE HILSON Uh-hmm. 

01:55:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE Uh-hmm. Ah, yeah, ah, I think what you are hoping to do is really to tie in this a lot of discussion with the main theme as we talked about for - 

01:55:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:55:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE - ah, of the authors. 

01:55:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:55:35
ROBERT K. CONYNE Uhm, which is very helpful, helpful to do. Would, would anyone, uhm, ah, in addition like to take, uhm, take a try at summarizing, uhm, these last, ah, several points that were made, uhm, Gail has just on that a bit. A, anyone else like to try to tied things together and lets see what you have? 

01:55:55
DAVE WELSCHER I, I, this, this is kinda part of it I think we talk about so many things. 

01:55:55
ROBERT K. CONYNE Yes. 

01:55:55
DAVE WELSCHER I think we can really, ah, put it in the capsule but, ah, I hear a kind of a caution or like learn from our mistakes. 

01:56:05
ROBERT K. CONYNE Hmm. 

01:56:05
DAVE WELSCHER And that, and that is an evolution. 

01:56:05
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:56:10
JACKIE SMITH Yeah. 

01:56:10
DAVE WELSCHER You know, and that like I said before to expected to be up and running in perfect to per shot is, is kinda of worry and, and just to look at those, you know, vocational, ah, education and, and guidance has been going on in this country for a very long time and we still don't have a right. 

01:56:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:56:25
UNKNOWN Its theory. 

01:56:25
DAVE WELSCHER You know, still not perfect so to speak. 

01:56:25
UNKNOWN So its a theory. 

01:56:25
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:56:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:56:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE I really, uhm, ah, like the, uhm, respect and, uhm, and appreciation that you're showing in your discussion of what you understand to be China's situation regarding career guidance. 

01:56:40
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:56:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE Ah, and that its different from ours and, and yet maybe there are some ways in which they could benefit from some of what we had been through as well. And that seems to made me very, very, uhm, ah, helpful as a view point. 

01:56:55

Step 6 Application to Oneself ✓Members identify ways in which the information contained in the author's work has practical application in the member's personal or professional lives 

01:57:00
F.ROBERT WILSON The sixth step is application of the authors work to oneself. In this step members will attempt to apply the learning scheme from the authors work to their own personal and professional lives. After orienting the members to the work of this step, the group moves directly into discussion and evidences distributed leadership. In this segment Dr. Conyne acts more as a member asking content questions and giving opinions about content, toward the end the leader facilitates closing off the discussion of applications to the self so that the group can move on to the next step. 

01:57:35
Application to Oneself 

01:57:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE Well, how did this strike you personally? Ah, I think this is where and be Shirin and, and Holly Bell were wanting to get to earlier in discussion, and, and now we can get into it much more directly cuz this is what the step, uhm, six in the learning through discussion method is about that is how did this applied to each of us. So what, what kinds of reactions do you have? 

01:58:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA My initial reaction is how, how would I've worked to have this when I was in the seventh grade. You know, being exposed to the world of work and some knowledge about myself and that sort of thing, uhm, you know, I, ah, I maybe in a di-- at a different point where now then, you know, how I had this sort of information then, so. Hmm. 

01:58:25
HOLLY BELL Well this, this article, ah, back to what I mention early on and, and this, uhm, meeting today I, I just think that, uhm, reading this article makes me realize that as a career counselor which is something I, I would like to be doing, uhm, I must taken to, taken to, uhm, consideration the fact that Chinese students may not be open to accepting the fact that they can make a choice about what they wanted to know and actually look inside themselves and say well, I like this or I don't like this because they're still used to be told, being told that, okay, they should like this and they will work here and everything else, ah, this helps me realize that they may not be recep-- as receptive to me as a career counselor then make that, you know, than maybe in American students, okay. 

01:59:05
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Well, you know, I work with American students and I think a lot of American students don't feel that way either. 

01:59:10
UNKNOWN Oh, uh-hmm. 

01:59:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:59:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA A lot of students, you know, the parents tell them what to do - 

01:59:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:59:15
SHIRIN VAKHARIA - they've never really had an opportunity for decision making and when they do have that opportunity they can't do it, uhm, because they have the skills. And, you know, the DOT the Dictionary Occupational Titles, I've looked at that too its overwhelming and I, and I don't think we as Americans even realized the amount of choice we have in course selection. 

01:59:35
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:59:35
SHIRIN VAKHARIA So... 

01:59:35
ROBERT K. CONYNE A point, interesting. 

01:59:35
GALE HILSON I think we take it for granted. 

01:59:35
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:59:35
GALE HILSON No? 

01:59:35
UNKNOWN No. 

01:59:40
GALE HILSON Somewhere along the line, you know, as a child we even taken, taken for granted, even though it's introduced to us at an early age. Ah, we still take it for granted and we're going to professions that maybe our families want us to go into, but, ah, then later on in life then we move in to something that we really want to do. 

01:59:55
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:00:00
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:00:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE I, I note that, ah, just wanted to sneak this in - 

02:00:00
GALE HILSON Okay. 

02:00:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE - and back with that as that not all of us, ah, in this country - 

02:00:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:00:05
ROBERT K. CONYNE - either are, uhm, are made aware or feel that, ah, we have, ah, openness in terms of choice making. 

02:00:10
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-hmm. 

02:00:15
UNKNOWN That's true, that's true. 

02:00:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE In terms of career is in, ah, have a lot of, ah, American citizens of course who, who feel trapped or feel they had no - 

02:00:20
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:00:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE - no or limited future, ah, and this is an issue that - 

02:00:25
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:00:25
ROBERT K. CONYNE - ah, as counselors, ah, willing to be concerned with I think. 

02:00:25
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:00:25
ROBERT K. CONYNE It's like, yes Fan Ye? 

02:00:30
FAN YE Ah, it's just talking about taken for granted in you Gail. 

02:00:30
GALE HILSON Uh-hmm. 

02:00:30
FAN YE We do we also take it for granted that our best choice of career should have be the one that enables us to make the most of contribution - 

02:00:40
GALE HILSON Yeah. 

02:00:40
FAN YE - to the social good. 

02:00:40
GALE HILSON Uh-hmm. 

02:00:40
FAN YE We had been brought up to thinking like that. 

02:00:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:00:45
GALE HILSON Uh-hmm. 

02:00:45
FAN YE I'm really glad that now finally if the time comes that we could, ah, take our own personality and, uhm, attitude into consideration. 

02:00:55
GALE HILSON That's true, that's true. 

02:00:55
ROBERT K. CONYNE I just had a reaction any one talk too much as a facilitator of this, you know, so I try to make it brief but me-- my, my spontaneous reaction and wanted to said is, ah, and that might be something that we could take from China that could be beneficial too and such - 

02:01:10
FAN YE Uh-huh. 

02:01:10
ROBERT K. CONYNE - in terms of the social good. 

02:01:10
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah. 

02:01:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:01:10
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:01:10
ROBERT K. CONYNE What we are doing in relation to our preparation to serve the social good. 

02:01:15
FAN YE Question of balance thing. 

02:01:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE Question of balancing. 

02:01:15
DAVE WELSCHER I was just thinking on the same line. 

02:01:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE Zero? 

02:01:20
DAVE WELSCHER Ah, I was thinking about what the had just said and, and then my, ah, my role as a counselor in high school, and, ah, we have a lot, you know, our counsel are seniors going off to college trying to make the beginnings of their career decisions. 

02:01:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:01:30
DAVE WELSCHER And I see so many of them making their decisions on what you said on, on money or - 

02:01:35
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah. 

02:01:35
DAVE WELSCHER - on what their parents want them to do. And that was gonna make them happy or not what's gonna benefit - 

02:01:40
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:01:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:01:40
DAVE WELSCHER - the common good. 

02:01:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:01:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:01:45
DAVE WELSCHER It's, it's gone almost too far - 

02:01:45
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:01:45
DAVE WELSCHER - to one way. Yes, exactly towards to. 

02:01:50
PAT SAMPLES Its interesting, uhm, because the way that this affecting me was in a point that you made Gail and that you're making Dave and that's that. Uhm, it seems like the choices I made right up at high school or now in college were once that were dependent on what other people thought. 

02:02:05
UNKNOWN That's true. 

02:02:05
PAT SAMPLES And they were very much based on, uhm, talents or interest but when it comes right down to it, I'm now making transitional changes that have to do more with how I perceive my contribution - 

02:02:20
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:02:20
PAT SAMPLES - to the world. 

02:02:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE Hmm. 

02:02:20
PAT SAMPLES And, uhm, I see that as being in, ah, a transition that we make, ah, older - 

02:02:25
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:02:25
ROBERT K. CONYNE Hmm. 

02:02:25
PAT SAMPLES - as a older person and, ah, older 30s, 40s, 50s, whatever - 

02:02:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:02:30
PAT SAMPLES - in America. 

02:02:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE In this line of thought we might take this opportunity to talk a little bit more about that, about to why each of us is attracted to what we're doing, ah, each of us. 

02:02:40
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:02:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE Why is counseling something that's pulling us? What, what is that about counseling? Is it to make a lot of money or the value that gets moving in to each one of you. Hmm. Yeah. 

02:02:55
PAT SAMPLES Thought, ah, for me it is looking at what my contribution is, you know - 

02:03:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE Yeah. 

02:03:00
PAT SAMPLES - the fact that what I've done before has it made the kind of contribution that I would like to make. 

02:03:05
HOLLY BELL Along with that Pat its like the contribution in turn gives yourself fulfilment. 

02:03:10
UNKNOWN Yes, exactly. 

02:03:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:03:10
HOLLY BELL Because that's what (inaudible ) talking about. 

02:03:11
PAT SAMPLES Exactly. 

02:03:11
HOLLY BELL It's sounds so perfect to me. 

02:03:11
UNKNOWN And, ah, and challenging. 

02:03:15
DAVE WELSCHER I think, I think that's the important thing that we need to ask counselors and vocational counselors to in still in, in the generation coming up is that you can go out of personal fulfillment - 

02:03:25
UNKNOWN That's right. 

02:03:25
DAVE WELSCHER - by helping everyone else. 

02:03:25
UNKNOWN True. 

02:03:25
DAVE WELSCHER And I don't think, I don't think that clicks immediately - 

02:03:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:03:30
DAVE WELSCHER - and, ah, you know, I think we are lucky and that we realized that, to be honest with you. I don't think most people do. 

02:03:35
JIM HIGHTOWER Sure, that's what gonna say. I think, uhm, as we get in this country as we grow older I think the stuff ac-- actualization and fulfilment become ma-- much more important than, ah, money making. 

02:03:45
ROBERT K. CONYNE Oh, uh-hmm. 

02:03:50
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm, uh-hmm. It is. 

02:03:50
JIM HIGHTOWER And, ah, I think, ah, what Gail was saying about, ah, ah, the resources that we have, ah, or not, not aware of those resources I think, even though we may not be aware of those resources I think its important, ah, to know that they are and, ah, that it makes it a lot easier for people to get in to a career track - 

02:04:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:04:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE Hmm. 

02:04:15
JIM HIGHTOWER - and or prepare for career track then not knowing what, what the-- well work what the, what's needed for the world or work. 

02:04:25
ROBERT K. CONYNE Hmm. 

02:04:25
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:04:25
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:04:25
JACKIE SMITH But you know Jim in relation to that one of the things that, that really struck me about this article and I had done some other readings because I wanted to just realized myself with what the reform was in China and, ah, there are some, some parts of China like, you know, ah, Shanghai 

02:04:40
FAN YE Uh-hmm. 

02:04:40
JACKIE SMITH - for example that, uhm, you know, they run on toward, uhm, you know, its a real, ah, transient(ph) part of, ah, China and will, you know, there are a lot of things available to them, uhm, just like in, uhm, some parts of our country. 

02:04:55
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:04:55
JACKIE SMITH But there are a lot of disadvantage, uhm, communities where they don't have this information. 

02:05:05
GALE HILSON Uh-hmm. 

02:05:05
JACKIE SMITH There is no career guidance. 

02:05:05
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:05:05
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:05:05
JACKIE SMITH And, you know, consequently, you know, people are getting lost in the shuffle. 

02:05:10
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:05:10
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:05:10
JACKIE SMITH And my-- and I think really sensitive to the fact that the parts of China that maybe are not pushing towards (inaudible ) will get lost to the shuffle like a lot of our minorities have. 

02:05:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:05:20
UNKNOWN Oh, yes. 

02:05:20
GALE HILSON Yes, yes, fall within the corrects, 

02:05:25
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:05:25
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:05:25
ROBERT K. CONYNE Hmm. 

02:05:25
UNKNOWN Good point. 

02:05:25
DAVE WELSCHER Very good. 

02:05:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:05:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE Yeah. Thank you for making that point. Uhm, is there anything else that, uhm, anyone is noting about applications? 

02:05:35
FAN YE Actually all the topic I think for me - 

02:05:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE Yeah. 

02:05:40
FAN YE - uhm, getting to this program is like a mid-- mid-- career change cause that being a teacher for about eight to ten years and it was not the title I like my teaching job, I still do. But it's just the, you know, kind of sometimes you would wonder, uhm, what I've got other potentials and making a person who experiment. Having taught about contributing to the society, yet, its kind of personal choice. 

02:06:10
ROBERT K. CONYNE Uh-hmm. 

02:06:10
FAN YE An experiment of that. 

02:06:10
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:06:10
PAT SAMPLES Almost like you didn't get a chance to do that earlier so you got to reverse the process a little bit. 

02:06:15
FAN YE Yeah. 

02:06:15
PAT SAMPLES Really. 

02:06:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE Yeah, wonderful. 

02:06:20
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Yeah, that's I, I made that personal choice decision maybe little earlier than you did because I wasn't out of, in the world work for eight to ten years. I haven't been out in the world to work but I realized early on that I do have a choice and that's a powerful thing. 

02:06:35
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:06:35
SHIRIN VAKHARIA And that's probably why I'm here early, at an early age versus maybe other people who didn't have that realization until later on. 

02:06:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE There's an interesting, ah, an article about, ah, career guidance for middle school students and... 

02:06:50
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm, uh-hmm. 

02:06:50
ROBERT K. CONYNE Can hold such, ah, complications, uhm, for us here in this country of course for you, ah, Fan from China, uhm... 

02:06:55
PAT SAMPLES I think this model really helps to emphasize that though. 

02:07:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE Hmm. 

02:07:00
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

02:07:00
PAT SAMPLES Because it has use start out thinking about the authors messages instead of jumping in with your - 

02:07:05
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:07:05
ROBERT K. CONYNE Hmm. 

02:07:05
PAT SAMPLES - ideas which is, ah, almost, ah, automatic. 

02:07:10
ROBERT K. CONYNE Hmm, often is automatic, well done a nice job I think with some of this personal application. 

02:07:15
FAN YE I have one more point. 

02:07:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE How about one more point. 

02:07:20
JACKIE SMITH Oh, after, after Fan, uhm, give us-- help me to understand what a danwei is. 

02:07:25
FAN YE Uh-hmm. 

02:07:25
JACKIE SMITH I begun to think about our own countries, uhm, community contribution to career guidance, and, uhm, that maybe that's another piece that we need to look at because our, our, uhm, economic institutions don't look at what they can offer to students, and to the educational process - 

02:07:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:07:45
JACKIE SMITH - just in terms of preparing them for the world and work and, and letting them know what's available. 

02:07:50
FAN YE Uh-hmm. 

02:07:50
JACKIE SMITH And that, you know, there is, there is a piece of that, that although that's in sound like it yields a lot of looking at individual abilities, these are good, these are good but I think we need to carry with us and that is that, you know, our society owe something to the world of career guidance. 

02:08:10
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:08:10
FAN YE Uh-hmm. 

02:08:10
ROBERT K. CONYNE Yes, excellent point. 

02:08:10
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:08:10
ROBERT K. CONYNE Thank you.

F.ROBERT WILSON The seventh step is evaluation of the way in which the author presented the work. In this step members will evaluate the author's style of presentation. After the leader provides the group with the orientation distributed leadership is evident. Members freely participate interactively, the leader facilitates exploration of diversity by asking for contrary views. Toward the end of the time allotted for this step the leader uses dissemination of an evaluation form to facilitate movement from step seven to the final evaluative step. 

02:08:55
Evaluation: Author's Work 

02:08:55
ROBERT K. CONYNE Let's move to the next, ah, step, its step, ah, seven in a learning through discussion, ah, method and we, we begun to address it a little bit already that has to deal with the authors points. The authors presentation, you know, this is where often, ah, you write that at discussion groups start of sort of saying I didn't like what the author said about. Didn't have agree with this and there should be this way and that way and, uhm, my idea of letting it away, so. 

02:09:20
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:09:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE And this is what this method does not allow us to do if we follow it, that is first of all we try to understand what the author has to say without carping about it or praising it to, to have it yourself. But now we can kinda partake it we come the point partaking as what, what about it? Uhm, in three to four minutes or so what, what do you think? Yeah. 

02:09:40
JIM HIGHTOWER Actually I think the author did an excellent job on comparing the two cultures and depicting the similarities and differences of the two different cultures. And, and emphasizing the importance of developing a career guidance program that's going to enhance those differences or, those differences in the culture. Its gotta be compatible with that culture. 

02:10:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE Hmm. 

02:10:00
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:10:00
DAVE WELSCHER Uhm, and, and kind of along the same lines when I first read this I didn't understand why they use a comparison to Canadian students. 

02:10:10
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:10:10
DAVE WELSCHER I was like, well that seems pretty self-evident why couldn't they just study the Chinese students and what they wanted and apply that. 

02:10:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE Uh-hmm. 

02:10:15
DAVE WELSCHER But what really-- then after the second time I read it would really made this article important to me was that it made me realize the differences between the two cultures and made me realize the similarities and how they can use someone similarities and be aware of the differences. 

02:10:35
ROBERT K. CONYNE Great . 

02:10:35
DAVE WELSCHER Ah, it became a very important point to me. 

02:10:35
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:10:35
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:10:35
ROBERT K. CONYNE Ah, I found that, and I, and I heard you say something for the second reading as well. 

02:10:40
DAVE WELSCHER Yeah. 

02:10:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE It take two well. 

02:10:40
UNKNOWN Yes, I heard that. 

02:10:40
UNKNOWN Heard that's... 

02:10:45
GALE HILSON Uh-hmm. I share the same, uhm, the same opinion also Dave, ah, because I thought well he could have made that same questionnaire, you know, with the Chinese students but no, it took the second and third reading for me and that's when it hit me but, you know, something than I thought was really neat was the author's smooth translation from, ah, the old way the new way and how he brought out that the need were there, for the, ah, Chinese middle - 

02:11:10
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:11:10
GALE HILSON - student. The needs for, ah, for guidance. 

02:11:15
DAVE WELSCHER Uh-hmm. 

02:11:15
GALE HILSON And, that was, that was really neat. 

02:11:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE Is there anybody who have a... 

02:11:20
GALE HILSON Educational. 

02:11:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE Thank you. Any contrary view is like? This wasn't so hard though. 

02:11:25
PAT SAMPLES Well I, ah... 

02:11:25
ROBERT K. CONYNE We'll move to evaluation of our own performance in just a moment. Go ahead. 

02:11:30
PAT SAMPLES Not so much about the content except that its related to the data, uhm, I tended to concentrate on the tables and compare them to the readings and in there were couple of places where I was quite confuse by what is something the author's were trying to say? Because the data in the table didn't support what they were saying, uhm, and specifically there was one where they made a point about, uhm, on page 162, they were talking about table four - 

02:12:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE Uh-hmm. 

02:12:00
PAT SAMPLES - and they are making a point about how friends were more important in Canada. 

02:12:00
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

02:12:00
PAT SAMPLES And in terms of its placement in the rank it was just the opposite. 

02:12:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:12:10
PAT SAMPLES Friends came higher they came as, as, ah, the end of influence for the Canadian and the and one step above for Chinese. So it wa-- it was confusing it wasn't clear if the data in the table is co-- incorrect, or mistype that sort of thing or if the interpretation. So that was a little frustrating for me but otherwise, ah, overall I thought the article was - 

02:12:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:12:30
PAT SAMPLES - was, was... 

02:12:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE Still the article is valuable. 

02:12:35
PAT SAMPLES Yes. 

02:12:35
ROBERT K. CONYNE Well, good points for a ticket, uhm. 

02:12:35
JACKIE SMITH But you know pat the one thing that I really appreciated though was the fact that they tried to support, uhm, this, the, uhm, stance for career guidance with some empirical evidence. 

02:12:45
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:12:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

02:12:45
JACKIE SMITH I think that, that important in terms of coming up with some evaluation in the future. 

02:12:50
PAT SAMPLES Well I find that really helpful because I'm often asking myself well, where did they get this idea? 

02:12:55
JACKIE SMITH Right. 

02:13:00
PAT SAMPLES Who made this up really. 

02:13:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE I don't meant to, uhm, ah, rush us to this, ah, before we finished, uhm, with, ah, evaluating the authors message but I'm wondering if, if, uhm, unless there is really something, ah, much more, ah, still significant to say about that could, could we look at our own functioning here? 

02:13:20
Step 8 Evaluation of the Group's Effort ✓Members evaluate the group's efforts. ✓Members evaluate the group's success at completing its task. ✓Members identify ways in which they can improve their group process. 

02:13:25
F.ROBERT WILSON The eighth and final step is evaluation of the groups process and performance. In this step members evaluate how well the group worked in accomplishing its purpose. The leader utilizes a structured evaluative format to facilitate this self evaluation process. Members engaged in self-evaluation freely and interactively. 

02:13:50
Evaluation: Group Performance 

02:13:50
ROBERT K. CONYNE And this would be step eight as we know I think of the, uhm, learning through discussion model and it has to do with evaluating group and individual performance. Just learning through discussion method is a very interesting method because it really tries to utilize, ah, group interaction and, and knowledge gained through one another's participation. And understanding of the, ah, of the article. And reactions to one another as well, ah, build all of that into, ah, increasing knowledge of anything that's correct. 

02:14:20
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:14:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE It utilizes group dynamics. This is a poi-- this is the place where we can really, ah, look at ourselves and how we do it. There is an evaluation form that cast out, uhm, ah, and I like you to, ah, to look at and think of this, uhm, ah, questions, ah, in relation to how we did and then we'll maybe have a discussion. And the idea is that if we are to get back together again to continue working together what we would learn from this, ah, feedback might be helpful to move us forward and keep us progressing. And, ah, building evaluation to the-- into the whole method. Can you just take a minute or so maybe to make some judgments about this. And I will just read this, ah, very quickly I felt the group meeting today was and evaluate that, my feelings during the meeting were mainly, evaluate that. I thought I learn from the discussion, uhm, I think the quality of interaction in our group was, I think our group promoted learning, evaluating this. Ah, then taking that maybe, uhm, could we start with, uhm, number one, I felt that the group meeting today was cause some excellent to, to bad. Uhm, what, what, what do you think about that? 

02:15:45
RON SPRAGUE I thought the meeting today was excellent, uhm, we, uhm, it was a great day of discussion, uhm - 

02:15:50
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Uh-hmm. 

02:15:50
RON SPRAGUE - between us and, ah, and that was a great little, ah, learning taking place at the same time - 

02:15:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:15:55
RON SPRAGUE - so, uhm, ah, at least, at least for me it, ah, very enjoyable, ah, very enjoyable meeting and, ah, very enjoyable discussion. 

02:16:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE Well that's great, uhm, and I love to hear this positive things. I, I guess I agree that, ah, is, is there, uhm, is there any, ah, any different kind of view point of it that we might, Jim. 

02:16:10
JIM HIGHTOWER Well, that is not different but I, I felt that, ah, meeting was I would say got too excellent because I think everybody came prepared and it like... 

02:16:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE Hmm. 

02:16:20
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:16:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE That's, that's why. 

02:16:20
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:16:20
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:16:20
DAVE WELSCHER Ah, I also felt, ah, excellent but I also felt that it was relaxed. 

02:16:25
ROBERT K. CONYNE Uh-hmm. Yeah. 

02:16:25
DAVE WELSCHER It as conversational. 

02:16:25
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:16:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE It was. 

02:16:30
DAVE WELSCHER It wasn't, ah, academics as, I mean, we talked about very academic material but it was relaxed. 

02:16:35
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:16:35
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:16:35
ROBERT K. CONYNE I really, uhm, ah, enjoyed the group interaction. 

02:16:35
DAVE WELSCHER Uh-hmm. 

02:16:35
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:16:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE You are very active and are responsive to each others ideas and, I thought that was really positive. 

02:16:45
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:16:45
ROBERT K. CONYNE Really liked it. Uhm, how about if we, uhm, ah, did we learn in this? Because, ah, an object here is to learn material and also to learn about group dynamics and learn about how we are on groups and how we function as group. Did we learn? Did you learn? What d'you think? 

02:17:00
SHIRIN VAKHARIA Well what's really valuable for me was having other peoples perspectives and information and that sort of thing, uhm, to, to get a broader view of the article and information that was presented in, obviously fun input was really valuable also. 

02:17:10
DAVE WELSCHER Yeah, I agree. 

02:17:15
UNKNOWN I mean, yes. 

02:17:15
UNKNOWN It's very much for clarifying. 

02:17:15
HOLLY BELL Hmm, could we can only, you know, we can only learn so much by just reading the article. 

02:17:20
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:17:20
HOLLY BELL And when you have all this other people around you to, to discuss it - 

02:17:20
GALE HILSON Uh-hmm. 

02:17:20
HOLLY BELL - its just amazing what, you know, everybody has the same point so, yeah. 

02:17:25
UNKNOWN The article came alive. 

02:17:30
HOLLY BELL Yeah. 

02:17:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE That's great. 

02:17:30
GALE HILSON Yes, it does. 

02:17:30
DAVE WELSCHER I'm actually gonna go back and read the article I think - 

02:17:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:17:30
DAVE WELSCHER - because what... 

02:17:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE Well, again or for the first time dude? 

02:17:35
DAVE WELSCHER Oh, its can be, oh, again. 

02:17:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE Again? 

02:17:40
DAVE WELSCHER But probably will be the fifth time I think but, ah, I just think it would be a completely different reading. 

02:17:40
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:17:45
ROBERT K. CONYNE Uh-huh. 

02:17:45
DAVE WELSCHER I was reading it through my eyes now I feel like I'm reading it through, you know, a little bit of everybody because of other people's ideas that ever been across my mind. 

02:17:50
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:17:50
ROBERT K. CONYNE And I was, I was concerned initially about, uhm, choosing this article I thought well maybe its too complicated to remove to, dry to something for this, ah, discussion to work and freedom to evaluate, uhm, wasn't true I guess. Uhm, I think that's often not true in this kinds of discussions when discussions take place sort of like this one - 

02:18:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:18:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE - well it did, and were you were all in but you're all prepared and really involved. 

02:18:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:18:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE That was, ah, really helping the article to come alive for me as well. 

02:18:20
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:18:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE I appreciate that. I think, ah... 

02:18:25
FAN YE One thing that I learned about group, sorry. 

02:18:25
ROBERT K. CONYNE It's okay. 

02:18:25
FAN YE Group dynamic is that we, I feel that we are more comfortable calling each other in our names. 

02:18:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:18:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:18:30
FAN YE In calling and - 

02:18:30
GALE HILSON First names. 

02:18:35
FAN YE - instead of saying that I read your article, I did this, you know. 

02:18:35
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:18:35
ROBERT K. CONYNE Yes. 

02:18:35
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

02:18:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE Personalizing it. 

02:18:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:18:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE I saw a lot of that talking to each other, building on each other's ideas, uhm, as well as introducing new ideas. 

02:18:45
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:18:45
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:18:50
ROBERT K. CONYNE That was really of, uhm, an, a whole mark in this group discussion today. 

02:18:50
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:18:55
ROBERT K. CONYNE Is, is there anything, uhm, that occurs to you that, uhm, shall we get back together to discuss more articles that we, you know, we want to improve? 

02:19:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:19:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE What, what can we do different or better that would be helpful to us? Anything? 

02:19:10
DAVE WELSCHER I think we're perfect. 

02:19:15
RON SPRAGUE Right, it would be difficult to, ah, to improve upon this meeting that we've had today, ah, I think, uhm, we've learned today that the preparation that we put into the article - 

02:19:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:19:30
RON SPRAGUE - is, ah, is important. So in the future we will do that before we get here, ah, the discussions that we've had have been important to, ah, ah - 

02:19:35
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:19:35
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:19:40
RON SPRAGUE - ah, all the, ah, relationships with our past learning. Ah, and I think those things we're-- now that we have this, ah, understanding importance with this skills with this particular model, uhm, we should incorporate them, ah, in future discussions, ah, so and this was a very good meaning, yeah, very, very difficult to improve. 

02:20:00
UNKNOWN Very informative. 

02:20:00
ROBERT K. CONYNE But maybe we could, uhm, conclude, uhm, our discussion today of, ah, using the learning through discussion method, ah, applied to this article, uhm, I, uhm, I wanna thank you for your involvement and, uhm, I learn through it. This sounds like most of you did, learn through it well as content and something about group process. And, uhm, with that perhaps we will just say thank you. 

02:20:30
ROBERT K. CONYNE Now you been watching a learning through discussion task group as it formed and the numbers worked together discussing a research article, and evaluated their own individual and group performance. Along the way we inserted awareness cues to help point out significant leader and number events and behaviors that occurred during the steps. Now let's turn to review of the key points that are contained in the training video. 

02:20:55
F.ROBERT WILSON For a task group to be successful there must be an agreed upon plan, in this video the agreed upon plan was to follow the steps of the LTD method. In a successful task group the leader pays attention to group process and we saw examples of the leader intervening to attend to the grou-- the process of this group. Boundaries, rules and structure also very important. The leader must be strong enough to enforce the boundaries and rules. If the leader does his or her job well the members will become self-governing and as the members become self governing the leaders should let them. 

02:21:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE We'll we hope that you have enjoyed watching this task group demonstration maybe some of the ideas that you been able to gather through watching it will be helpful to you as member of a task group or as a leader of a task group in your future work. 

02:21:55
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:21:55
JACKIE SMITH For me, uhm, there was so much information, there were so much that I wanted to say while initially a lot of things that I had on my, ah, information sheet were the same that other people had that very validating. At time I almost felt that there would too many people in the group because I couldn't get - 

02:22:15
ROBERT K. CONYNE So much. 

02:22:15
JACKIE SMITH - uh-hmm, there was so much information the people had so much to share that I didn't feel like I really, there wasn't enough time. 

02:22:20
ROBERT K. CONYNE Yeah. 

02:22:20
UNKNOWN Lack time it was - 

02:22:20
JACKIE SMITH Well, everybody to share. 

02:22:20
UNKNOWN - my issue, yes. 

02:22:20
JACKIE SMITH I thought that. 

02:22:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:22:25
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:22:25
ROBERT K. CONYNE Yeah, uhm, some of this people with this method the learning through discussion method feel its pinches in a little bit. Its constraining, its, it gets in a way sometimes, uhm, how would you regard that? 

02:22:35
GALE HILSON I think, ah... 

02:22:40
ROBERT K. CONYNE I'm sorry go ahead, Gale. 

02:22:40
GALE HILSON Ah, well, I think...
