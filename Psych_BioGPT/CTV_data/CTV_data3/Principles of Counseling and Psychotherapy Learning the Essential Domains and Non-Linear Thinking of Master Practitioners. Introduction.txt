Paul Peluso, Ph.D. 

00:00:30
PAUL PELUSO I can remember being in graduate school, late in the day going well into the night. And after working a full day, the last thing, I wanted was to listen to a lecture going on and on or worse having to watch an old grainy film of a counseling session that seemed to be going no where. It felt like an unending prison sentence. Well, that won't happen here. Hi, I'm Dr. Paul Peluso. A few years ago, my colleagues and I wanted to make a difference in the way students were trained in being counselors or therapists. Too often people were trained to act like clinicians, but we don't do a very good job of teaching how to think like clinicians. As a result, most people think of counseling or therapy like this. 

00:01:15
UNKNOWN I just don't know what to do. 

00:01:20
UNKNOWN So you don't know what to do? 

00:01:20
UNKNOWN I just got fired. My boyfriend ran away with my best friend. I had to put my dog to sleep and I'm being evicted. 

00:01:30
UNKNOWN So how does that make you feel? 

00:01:35
FAIL 

00:01:35
PAUL PELUSO Or what you saw in the movies. 

00:01:40
UNKNOWN What do you know. You can't help me. You're nothing more than a burnt out old failure who's wife is dead. 

00:01:45
UNKNOWN If you ever say anything like that to me again, I will end you. What do you know about real love, real life, real pain? 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN You're right, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. 

00:01:55
UNKNOWN It's, okay, son, It's not your fault, It's not your fault. 

00:02:05
UNKNOWN I think I'm cured now. I can go out and live a good life. 

00:02:10
FAIL 

00:02:10
PAUL PELUSO The result was a publication of our book, "Principles of Counseling and Psychotherapy: Learning the Essential Domains and Nonlinear Thinking of Master Practitioners" What's that? You have no idea what the Essential Domains and Nonlinear Thinking of Master Practitioners are? You, you don't either. Okay. Give me a minute to explain. Come with me. So one of the first things we did was look at all the different schools of therapy and think what do they have in common? Well, to illustrate this better, think of a common food like bread. All around the world and virtually every culture there is some form of bread. Well, what do they all have in common? The ingredients, we have things like flour, sugar, oil, water, yeast, salt, milk. You put them in different combinations, you get different kinds of bread. That's the same with a counseling or psychotherapy. You have different combinations of the common ingredients and you get different types of approaches. Some approaches might be crusty like psychodynamic. That would be like a Baguette. Uh… or you might have cognitive behavior. That's pretty generic, kind of like sandwich bread. Everybody uses it. Or you have brief solution focused that would be like a pita bread. There is not much time to rise. Well, you get the picture. You put the common ingredients in different combinations and you get different therapeutic approaches. Now in this video series, we want to introduce and demonstrate each of the seven domains. I'll show you the common ingredients of therapy. The eggs, the flour, water and the yeast, rather than a bunch of different schools. These domains are, domain 1, Connecting and engaging with the client. Domain 2, assessment. Domain 3, the therapeutic relationship. Domain 4, schema dynamics. Domain 5, emotions. Domain 6, ambivalence and domain 7, paradoxical interventions. So once you know what the ingredients are, how do you know which ones to use and how to mix them together? How much to use, how long to let it rise and how long to bake them? Well, that is where the teaching the non-linear thinking of master practitioners comes in. Like a great chef who knows his or her ingredients and just when to use them and how much, so too do master therapists seem to know just when and how to use these domains. The secret. Well, they think differently or what we call non-linear thinking. So what is that? Well, come with me. So perhaps, you've seen this. It's called the nine dot problem and if you have don't give away the answer, but probably you're smarter than everybody else watching this video. Okay, so the object of this is to take a pen and using four straight lines connect all nine dots. Oh, and you can't lift your pain off of the paper or the surface. Now, do I have a volunteer. Uh… thank you. Go and give it a try. One, two, three, four, oh, you missed one. Nice try though. I guess you'd loved the party, gets for you over there. Now, let me show you how it's done. One, two, three, four. See, all nine dot. 

00:05:35
UNKNOWN Hey. 

00:05:40
PAUL PELUSO What? That wasn't cheating. I've said four straight lines covering all nine dots and you couldn't pick the pen off the surface. I never said anything about staying inside the box. Your thinking put that constriction on there. And that's a good demonstration of non-linear thinking. Oftentimes, clients come in and their thinking has put them in a box. It's constrained them to think of only things in a certain way and not outside the box. Non-linear thinking needs going outside of the box and that's what master practitioners do to present, alternatives to clients for their problems in ways that they haven't even considered before. For example, if a person is a smoker, and says that they want to quit but have failed miserably. A linear thinking clinician might say, just stop. Don't do it anymore. On the other hand, a non-linear approach might say slow down. Even though you say you want to quit, maybe you're not quite ready yet. Let's look at what you are beginning up and what you might miss. In other words, non-linear thinking clinicians don't take things at face value. They don't ignore the face value of things. But they look for deeper connections. That is some of what we think is missing in the training of new practitioners. But don't take our word for it. In these videos, we're gonna show you some of the masters at work using these essential domains and we'll explain some of the non-linear thinking behind them. The good news is that we think that people who are attracted to this field like yourself already think this way. They are either just don't know it or they haven't been properly trained how to use it. Well, we're going to change that. So come on along, enjoy the videos and along the way we may have a special guest or two. Hopefully, you'll learn something about the essential domains in non-linear thinking of master practitioners also.

Paul Peluso, Ph.D. 

00:08:10
Domain 1 

00:08:10
Connecting and Engaging 

00:08:20
PAUL PELUSO The goal of the first domain is communication. Specifically, listening and responding. You know, language is so complex. What one person means to say as they're talking can often be misunderstood by another person as they are listening. That's why listening is so important for a clinician. In fact, you know, it kind of reminds me of a classic comedy scene about baseball. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN Well, I like baseball. 

00:08:40
PAUL PELUSO Oh, well then you will love this routine. It's a classic. It's called who's on first. 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN I don't know. 

00:08:50
PAUL PELUSO No, who's on first, the guy, the name of the guy in the first base is who. 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN I don't know. 

00:08:55
PAUL PELUSO I don't know who is on third base. 

00:08:55
UNKNOWN Well, if you don't know, how do you expect me to know. 

00:08:55
PAUL PELUSO You don't understand, the whole point of routine is confusion about who's on first, what's on second, I don't know who is on third base. 

00:09:05
UNKNOWN What's on second? 

00:09:05
PAUL PELUSO Yeah, now you're getting it. 

00:09:10
UNKNOWN I don't know. 

00:09:10
PAUL PELUSO No, he's on third base. Third base. Anyway. We've broken down communication into linear and non-linear types. First, there is the linear types. Linear communication consist of listening for content or the facts of what's being said and listening for feelings and those are the emotions that are being displayed or talked about and with both of these, you get a lot of information but not a lot of depth. It's kind of like an old black and white silent film. 

00:09:45
[music] 

00:09:50
PAUL PELUSO And so while you get a lot of information, you miss a lot too. By contrast at a non-linear communication is like adding silent in color. It gives depth and shading. It means that you listened for some of the subtleties of communication, some of the shadings and what clients say. Now, we've broken down non-linear communication into five types. And we use the acronym CAPIR, not those kinds of capers. CAPIR, CAPIR which stands for congruence, absence, presence, inference and resistance. First, there is congruence. That's the degree to which a person's actions and words match or the degree to which a person's past statements match with their present statements. So let me demonstrate that with this weight right here. 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN Hey what are you doing with that weight? 

00:10:35
PAUL PELUSO Now suppose, I accidentally dropped this on his foot. Oops. Sorry about that. Are you okay? 

00:10:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. 

00:10:45
PAUL PELUSO Now clearly, he's not okay. He's hoping up and down. He definitely looks like he's in pain. You might see something like this. I couldn't help but notice that you're kind of grimacing and limping. Are you sure, you're not hurt? 

00:10:55
UNKNOWN Actually, it hurt pretty bad. I just didn't wanted to spill the feelings. 

00:11:00
PAUL PELUSO Okay, well now, we are getting somewhere. Oh, umm… now put some ice on that. The next type of non-linear communication is listening for absence and for that we're going to need to go here. Many times clients are conspicuous about what or who they don't talk about. For example, if you know a client who is married but all they do is talk about their work. That is curious. Or if all they talk about is their father, never talk about their mother. That is curious. In fact, anything that is absent from a client's story is something that should arouse your natural curiosity and while curiosity might have killed the cat. Oh, that's not very nice. It is a clinician's most powerful non-linear tool and it's one of those things that enables us to be psychological detectives. That's right, behind every great clinicians is I want to be Sherlock Holmes and Nancy Drew. Okay. I'm never doing that voice again. But it is true that most of us who are drawn to this profession like some sort of mystery. In fact, I'm willing to bet that most of you who are watching this like to read detective novels or some sort of mystery novels or you like dramas or movies where you have to solve a crime. It's, I think part of what draws us to this profession is the fact that we like mysteries. And working with clients does just that. It's a way of trying to find out clues particularly when there are things that are absent in their story. It arouses our natural curiosity and that's non-linear thinking. Listening for presence means, listening for the non-verbal cues that a person gives off when communicating. The best example of this is mimes. Yes, mimes. Mimes can communicate a wide range of emotion just on their face. They can do happy, sad, angry. Well, they can even do a juggling. Yes, juggling. As a matter of fact, communication that's let's say, that any where from 75 to 85% of all communication is body posture, voice tone or facial expressions. Very nice. Anyway, communicating these to a client can often facilitate more deeper discussions with them because often they are not aware of what they are showing. Okay, now, we have to move on. Oh, by the way, there an invisible wall there. Next, we'll talk about inference. Many times people will tell you what they want by telling you what they don't want. For example, when they say, I don't want to go on medication or I don't want to end up like my mother or I don't want to lose my family. 

00:13:50
UNKNOWN Well, I guess, it would be nice if maybe we'd go to a movie or a play. 

00:13:55
PAUL PELUSO Okay. And what do you think stops you from doing that? 

00:14:00
UNKNOWN Uh… nothing uh… need for a baby-sitter. 

00:14:05
PAUL PELUSO Okay. Do you know anybody? Have you used anybody as a baby-sitter before? 

00:14:10
UNKNOWN Uh… yes we've used one of teachers of the day care before. 

00:14:15
PAUL PELUSO Okay, so that's not really a problem. What's the real obstacle? 

00:14:25
UNKNOWN I guess, I don't want to have the planning. I don't, I don't want to have to be the one that put it together. 

00:14:30
PAUL PELUSO So you want to be asked out on a date? 

00:14:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah, I do. 

00:14:35
PAUL PELUSO All of these statements tell you about the client's goals and by getting the focus on what they want while what they want to avoid can make them aware of what positive alternatives that they can work towards. Okay, four down, one more to go. Last there is resistance. 

00:14:55
UNKNOWN At last. But why is it last? It should be first. 

00:14:55
PAUL PELUSO Well, it doesn't matter what order it's in, it's just fit the acronym, CAPIR. 

00:15:05
UNKNOWN You are a very rigid man. 

00:15:05
PAUL PELUSO Anyway, I suppose you would like to define resistance. 

00:15:10
UNKNOWN Yup. 

00:15:10
PAUL PELUSO Please go ahead. 

00:15:15
UNKNOWN Resistance is an unconscious defense mechanism against the analyst, leading to conscious awareness, the pain the patient has repressed. 

00:15:20
PAUL PELUSO Well, it could be that but it could also be just an indicator that the therapist is moving too fast or that the client really isn't ready to change. 

00:15:30
UNKNOWN No, this is not correct. 

00:15:35
PAUL PELUSO Well, now, who's being rigid? Whatever the definition is, the underlying message is that I'm not ready or willing to change right now. Now sometimes this can be expressed overtly, the client just saws no. other times, you might here statements like yes, but or I'll try or I've tried that before. In these cases, you probably want to slow down and explore these in a little bit more detail. The biggest mistake that clinicians make is that they confuse client's statement of acceptance with real commitment to change. That's why it's so important to use both linear and non-linear elements of communication in order to be sure that the client is effectively committing to change. Now, let's take a look at some examples on video of both linear and non-linear elements of communication. See, if you can spot how clinicians use these effectively to get clients to engage in therapy. 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN So, tell me the first thing that comes to your mind? Oh, I see so you feel like you have no say in these matters. That, we will have to help you find your voice. 

00:16:40

00:16:50
Brad Keeney, Ph.D. 

00:16:50
Listening and Responding for Congruence 

00:16:50
"What do you mean when you say alcoholic?" 

00:16:55
UNKNOWN Because of his alcohol problem which, he doesn't really want to get help for. He doesn't really seem think there is a problem. 

00:17:00
BRAD KEENEY So you really want to be a good mother and do the right thing. 

00:17:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. He seems to think that I want to be a mother more than I want to be a wife which I don't really think is true. It's just like I had that role. I don't think he realizes that she does take a lot of work, a lot of paying attention to. I don't know how to use the right voice. So that she needs a lot more attention than he does right now and he's also then kind of person who's always been the center of attention in everyone's life and he just doesn't know how to accept the fact that my attention is now going towards more, toward Cassie and not him. 

00:17:40
BRAD KEENEY You know, when you say he's an alcoholic, give me some sense of what that means to you? This is what everyone is saying, this is, if he come. 

00:17:50
UNKNOWN Basically umm… he has a good job. 

00:17:50
BRAD KEENEY He's able to keep a job. 

00:17:50
UNKNOWN Uh… he's been able to keep the job. He's been at this job that he has about three years which is as long as we've been married. He's been here in Illinois for about seven years. He's originally from Petersburg. Umm… he can drink about eight to ten beers a night. Umm… probably a couple of shot of tequila. Umm… basically takes care of himself. 

00:18:15
BRAD KEENEY Has he changed number of drinks? 

00:18:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, he does. The first that I really noticed it and slowly, slowly, cut on to it. 

00:18:25
BRAD KEENEY Then will you change when he changes? Does it create a change in you? 

00:18:25
UNKNOWN Kind of ignore, I try to do the best I can. I have my routines when I come home. Get her dinner, get her bath. 

00:18:35
Marsha Linehan, Ph.D. 

00:18:35
Listening and Responding to Congruence 

00:18:35
"So it violates your moral values…" 

00:18:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Thoughts. I deserve to be home, I like to be home, I want to be home. It's wonderful to be home. 

00:18:45
UNKNOWN Maybe. 

00:18:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Maybe or is it… 

00:18:45
UNKNOWN I'm not really aware that I'm thinking of. 

00:18:45
MARSHA LINEHAN As if you're not aware, take it from me. I'm not doing it. And there is no such thing as not aware of thoughts. Okay, if you're thinking it, you're thinking it. All right. But so, what happens when you're fifteen minutes late by the way, what's the consequence? 

00:19:05
UNKNOWN There hasn't been a consequence. 

00:19:05
MARSHA LINEHAN That's the problem. 

00:19:10
UNKNOWN Well, we went show this video to my boyfriend. Umm… no, I just think, it's… 

00:19:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Actually, that would be a very thoughtful thing to do. 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN To show him the video? 

00:19:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN No, I'm sure, I will. 

00:19:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

00:19:25
UNKNOWN But I, I feel that it's umm…, it's by, it's you know if he, I was giving a lecture every Sunday morning and he was late, I was be insulted by that. 

00:19:35
MARSHA LINEHAN So in other words, it's a violation of moral values but you haven't been punished by anyone else. So your boyfriend has never said a word about that? 

00:19:40
UNKNOWN No. 

00:19:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:19:45

00:19:50
Leigh McCullough, Ph.D. 

00:19:50
Listening and Responding to Congruence 

00:19:55
UNKNOWN He doesn't want to believe it but says, you know, we have to get a divorce. I really want a divorce, meaning, he just doesn't agree to. He says, I don't want my son to be without us being together as it could be better for us they have, you know, we could see whenever we want to see him, you could see whenever you want to see him. But we cannot be together. He says, no, I don't a divorce. My kid with some other father. 

00:20:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH It looks like you're, you're trying to reason this out with. 

00:20:20
UNKNOWN It shouldn't be with the mother and father, if this has been. I really want a divorce. 

00:20:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So intellectually, you know, this. 

00:20:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:20:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And, and our job tonight as much as possible is emotionally how to help you get there. 

00:20:35
UNKNOWN Just let him keep going. 

00:20:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN When I hear him, he says something that, you know, pushes a button and it escalates me, I get it for and I yell because you know, your mom, she so old, she gonna die of cancer, I mean, You know, and it just hurts me. 

00:20:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Okay, in that situation, let's go to that. Your mom, she's old, she's gonna die of cancer and so he's trying to provoke you. 

00:21:00
UNKNOWN Well, I do to, I prove him if I have to, as I can never had a mother and a mother who care about you neither. It's like he'll talk about my mom, I always had a mom and we'll go back and forth until. 

00:21:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Words are one thing. When people get mad, they say things. 

00:21:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:21:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH To try to hurt but, but he's using physical violence and there is no excuse for that and you keep, you keep saying that there is some excuse for what he's done to you. Some part of you knows that's not true. 

00:21:25
UNKNOWN I feel… 

00:21:30
Sue Johnson, Ph.D. 

00:21:30
Listening and Responding to Presence " 

00:21:30
"I can see that in your face…" 

00:21:35
SUE JOHNSON Well, let me put in another way, when I look into your face, I feel like I can see some of that. You can touch that right now. 

00:21:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:21:45
SUE JOHNSON And you know the other thing about everyone in this room is if we are really honest, we all know that feeling anyway. Yeah. 

00:21:50
UNKNOWN Well. 

00:21:55
Scott Miller, Ph.D. 

00:21:55
Listening and Responding to Congruence 

00:21:55
"How do you make the decision between the two…" 

00:22:00
UNKNOWN An hour or two. 

00:22:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. So when you have that feeling, umm… of things kind of burning inside one way you take care of it is like, look after yourself, that kept you I guess from what? 

00:22:10
UNKNOWN You know, it keeps me in control and… 

00:22:15
SCOTT MILLER Where did you learn this? 

00:22:15
UNKNOWN I don't know. It was something that made or something tell me. She always told me, one of the girlfriends read in the book that, one of the show is walk away. There had been always work because I say well, I've walked away last three times, we've had discussion or should turn and walk away. She involved me right out of the grudge, you know. Without I do it at work, you know, when things are going bad or whatever, I just go to water cooler and get a drink and just stay away from everybody and when I come back, I wanna hear hard it again. 

00:22:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:22:45
UNKNOWN Boss and me will discuss it, you know, what we need to do and we'll go from there. That way nobody gets hurt and it's the safest way to do it. 

00:22:55
SCOTT MILLER So there is a combination of things I'm catching here that, that you're not only sometimes take a break and say, I got to get away. But there is also times where you discuss it. How, how do you make the decision between the two? I mean, I'm, I'm sort of… 

00:23:10
UNKNOWN Just kind of feeling out the situation between how the boss is reacting and how I feel about it, you know, how things are going in general, you know, it's been kind of days, where everything is just went wrong. I just walk away. I go to church but you know but things have been going good all of a sudden, we got a problem. Well, what is the problem here? Find out why and we go from there. 

00:23:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:23:35
UNKNOWN If there was something I did or just the way things happened, you know, just put it behind us all and get, you know. 

00:23:40
SCOTT MILLER What was the last part again. 

00:23:45
UNKNOWN You know, we just put everything behind us, you know, sure I screwed up or he did, you know, we don't wanna tend to screw up, but if we're working, it happens. 

00:23:55
SCOTT MILLER So there is a big forgiveness part of it too. Okay, you know, I'm not gonna make a hill out of every molehill that okay.

Steve Andreas, MA 

00:24:00
Listening and Responding to Congruence 

00:24:05
STEVE ANDREAS So where does it start? When after you… 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN Right after he said, you can't do that. 

00:24:10
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, so what is the first thing that's on your mind? 

00:24:10
UNKNOWN Yes, I can. 

00:24:10
STEVE ANDREAS Yes, I can. 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:24:15
STEVE ANDREAS Take the class. 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN Yes. And then it was how, you know, I can't, I can't believe this. That's… 

00:24:25
STEVE ANDREAS It's never happened to you before? 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN What that I can't take a class or… 

00:24:30
STEVE ANDREAS That you couldn't believe that, I mean… 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN No, it happens always on. 

00:24:35
STEVE ANDREAS Exactly, so you could believe it right. 

00:24:35
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:24:35
STEVE ANDREAS But you said, you couldn't believe it. 

00:24:40
UNKNOWN I just get frustrated. 

00:24:40
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

00:24:40
UNKNOWN Oh, I get tensed. I know, I'm getting angry because I don't know what to do, even how to explain it. 

00:24:50

Steve Andreas, MA 

00:24:55
Listening and Responding to Presence 

00:24:55
"I hear your voice change…" 

00:24:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Can you tell me a little more about what's going on there? A little bit of the really beginning of the snowball, that's where it would be most useful. I mean there are several things, I can do even though. 

00:25:10
[sil.] 

00:25:15
UNKNOWN My mom. 

00:25:20
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. And where is, where, when you think of your mom, when you forgive him, where is she? She's in the same location, somewhere different than your personal space? 

00:25:30
UNKNOWN She's closer. 

00:25:35
STEVE ANDREAS She's closer, okay. Where? 

00:25:40
[sil.] 

00:25:45
UNKNOWN I don't know, it's like, really right next to me. 

00:25:50
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, right there. 

00:25:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:25:50
STEVE ANDREAS Close to you. Here, I hear your voice change, so there is softness there, right. 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:25:55
STEVE ANDREAS So I believe you, you have forgiven her. Some people, they have sort of forgiven but not. But I hear in your voice, you really have forgiven her. There is a softness there right. Okay, great. Now here is the hard part. This is the easy part. 

00:26:10
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:26:10
STEVE ANDREAS We lead into the hard part and with lots of warning. If you want to forgive this person here, one way to do is to represent him over him close and so on in the same way, it represent your mom. Now, I'm willing to do that right now. Most people are. Right? 

00:26:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:26:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, now, what are your objections? Okay, the objections. 

00:26:40
UNKNOWN I hate him. 

00:26:40
STEVE ANDREAS For what he did. Okay. 

00:26:45
UNKNOWN I hate him, so I…. 

00:26:45
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:26:45
UNKNOWN I hate for where I was cheated. 

00:26:45
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:26:50
[sil.] 

00:26:55
UNKNOWN And, yeah, that's what it. 

00:27:00
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Now this will take a little while to get this understanding across. Umm… but the first thing, I want to mention is I assume we had some warm feelings for this person as well. Okay, but he violated some of your values in ways that are very important for you to maintain. Right? 

00:27:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:27:15
STEVE ANDREAS Now you… 

00:27:20
Jon Carlson, PsyD, EdD, ABPP 

00:27:20
Present & Inference 

00:27:20
UNKNOWN I think so. 

00:27:25
JON CARLSON Okay. And umm… what do you each think, I mean, you each said that the part that I don't like is, you know his anger and, and her attitude. What do you think, your role is in this? Like you had to put in your own words, what you contribute to the problem? 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN And I am sure, he contribute a lot, you know, he still mean, but, it's still his, his temper how easily and fast he gets mad, it's still, it's still a hard thing to deal with. His is not only between the two of us, you know, the kids can make him angry too. So. 

00:28:00
JON CARLSON So what's your role though? His is getting angry. What often we have a pretty good picture of what our partner's role is, but it's kind of nice to look back on ourself. What would you guess your role is? He says the attitude. Yeah. 

00:28:20
[sil.] 

00:28:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, I uh… I do have an attitude when things start going wrong. I do get an attitude and I argue back. 

00:28:30
JON CARLSON So is that what an attitude would mean to you, is our getting back. 

00:28:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, pretty much. She argues back and just spiteful. 

00:28:45
JON CARLSON You're kind of… On your. What does spiteful means? 

00:28:50
UNKNOWN Feel that I'm spiteful. You know, I would take a revenge or anything like that. I don't feel that I'm that way. You know, I just try to prove a point to him, if he's acting a certain way especially where the kids are involved. They try and get him to see it in my way. 

00:29:10
JON CARLSON How does that work? 

00:29:10
UNKNOWN It doesn't work. 

00:29:10
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:29:10
UNKNOWN Because it has to be her way. 

00:29:15
JON CARLSON So what I did is prove a point and prove a point means my way. Seeing it my way. 

00:29:20
UNKNOWN We're seeing it from other than the way he is seeing it. You know, if he's treating a certain individual in the household a certain way, and what I would consider it being damaging, you know, I would like him to see that. 

00:29:35
JON CARLSON Okay and when that's going on, that's, that's a time that you take for teaching moment…

The "Columbo" Approach 

00:29:45
"This is just a guess on my part…" 

00:29:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Other people don't make us happy that's I agree with it you completely. Do you feel and this is just a little guess on my part but now I'm trying to sense what's going on here. Do you feel a little bit that if you get hooked up with this guy that he'll be controlling of you a little bit? 

00:30:00
UNKNOWN I'm worried about that. I mean, I think right now, he holds back a lot because he knows. 

00:30:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, well now it's easy. 600 miles apart. 

00:30:10
UNKNOWN And he knows, you know, because I put my foot down a lot and say, you know, no, that's not your decision, you know, I've done that in the past. So I think, he holds back but I think he could be kind of controlling. And this is actually the first time, I mean, I've had relationships but that I've had a real serious one where I've thought along these lines. 

00:30:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Part of this, you didn't think that much about it but… 

00:30:35
UNKNOWN No, I've had relationships along this was like three months, you know. 

00:30:40
WILLIAM GLASSER What happened to your other relationships a little bit? 

00:30:40
UNKNOWN Umm… a lot of the time and I learnt that it was like, I was always the one doing all the work and trying… 

00:30:45
WILLIAM GLASSER So you attract the guys that see you as a kind of a can… 

00:30:55
William Glasser, M.D. 

00:30:55
Listening and Responding to Absence 

00:30:55
"What is the opportunity you are blowing?" 

00:30:55
WILLIAM GLASSER about that. Okay and fortunately, you know, fortunately or unfortunately, I don't know which it is. It's your life. 

00:31:10
UNKNOWN And when I think, if, if I blow this up opportunity, I might never, you know, get this chance again and then my grandmother is telling me that, you know, I don't want to grow old by myself and you know, I'm going to regret it and you know, I don't know. I just, I don't know what I'm supposed to do. 

00:31:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, what is this opportunity that you're blowing? 

00:31:30
UNKNOWN Well, the chance to get married. 

00:31:30
WILLIAM GLASSER To get married. 

00:31:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:31:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, all right. And but how do you see the marriage right now, as you say the chance to get married. Is that all, is it only the chance to be happy or is it the chance to be not happy? I mean what are the chances in this thing? 

00:31:55
UNKNOWN Well, I'd have to relocate…

00:32:00
Listening and Responding to Inference 

00:32:00
"The Room is Empty, and your life is empty?" 

00:32:05
JUDITH BECK And sometimes there maybe images or pictures, pictures of yourself back in Chicago. 

00:32:10
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:32:10
JUDITH BECK Maybe we should talk about the Chicago picture for a minute. 

00:32:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:32:15
JUDITH BECK So, you see yourself in Chicago, is it at a particular house where you grew up? 

00:32:20
UNKNOWN Yes, in the area. In yes, really in that particular, yeah. 

00:32:25
JUDITH BECK In a particular room in that house? 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, the room I grew up here. 

00:32:30
JUDITH BECK Okay and what are you doing? What do you see yourself in that room? 

00:32:35
UNKNOWN It's just a window, I used to look out. I could see downtown Chicago and I'm just looking out that window. I've spent so much time looking out that window. Making, thinking about what I was going to do when I grow up and all that stuff. 

00:32:50
JUDITH BECK And here you see yourself back in that same room still looking out the window. 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:32:55
JUDITH BECK Yeah, and what does that mean to you that you're back in the room looking out the window again? 

00:33:00
UNKNOWN When I used to look out that window, when I used to think about all the places that I wanted to see downtown and all the things that I really wanted to do and what I wanted to be. It was just, when I think about it now, talking about it, it was, kind of comforting. 

00:33:20
JUDITH BECK So it's optimistic when you were younger. 

00:33:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:33:25
JUDITH BECK Now, now when you have the image of being back in that same room and you have the thought, I might not make it, then you're having the same kind of perspective look out the window? 

00:33:40
UNKNOWN It's like umm… when I'm looking out the window, it's like I don't know the room is empty, that's all I know. The room is, is completely empty. The house is completely empty and it's like, the only thing that bring light to the room is just the few out the window. 

00:34:00
JUDITH BECK Right. 

00:34:00
UNKNOWN And so, I don't, I really. 

00:34:05
JUDITH BECK Do, do I get the sense that, it says, if the room is empty and your life is empty? 

00:34:10
UNKNOWN Some thing and I may feel like that I think that. 

00:34:15
JUDITH BECK You know, am I putting words in your mouth? 

00:34:15
UNKNOWN No. 

00:34:15
JUDITH BECK You think, that's right? 

00:34:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, I think that, that uh… that's one thing when I was there, the house is just empty. It's empty. 

00:34:25
JUDITH BECK And you feel as if it would be a step back, if you went back to that room? 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:34:35
JUDITH BECK And why would that be a step back? 

00:34:40
Steve Andreas, MA

Listening and Responding to Presence 

00:34:40
"A little shrug…" 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:34:45
STEVE ANDREAS In this kind of shrug and dismissal. Is that part of it? Because we needed just now, there was this kind of a little toss of the head, it's like tough luck. Tough luck right. 

00:35:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:35:00
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, good.

00:35:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. Okay. What about if, if we had uh… Brian sitting here and I ask him the same question, is miracles happen. What will he notice first that change, let's say in your relationship together? 

00:35:25
UNKNOWN What would be his… 

00:35:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah, what would be his… 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN Between her and our relationship. 

00:35:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

00:35:35
UNKNOWN That umm… I would stop sticking out for her all the time and that I would step back further from the friendship role and more into the mother role even though he would say that I've done better over the years. 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN Which shouldn't happen. 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN Well which should happen, it's balanced. Balanced in moderation, you know, what I mean. 

00:35:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So you missed the, the days when sort of down, more down on your loved ones. 

00:35:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, because he just comes in and runs everything. It's like, no one asked you to come here. 

00:36:00
UNKNOWN She was, you know, she would sleep with me then before we were married. 

00:36:10
William Glasser, M.D. 

00:36:10
Listening and Responding to Inference 

00:36:10
WILLIAM GLASSER To find out but you know that there is a lot of good things about him. But there are some things about going ahead and following what he want, it bothers you enough so that you're not jumping. 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN Right. And I don't know why. 

00:36:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, I mean, I think, you have some idea. If we talk about the idea, it could be better, I mean, I can't put words in your mouth but some things bother you and it's not a mystery, a total mystery to you. 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN Well, no, it's umm… that he's, he was married umm… for 22 years. 

00:36:50
WILLIAM GLASSER He's older than you. 

00:36:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, he's, not a lot older maybe six years. He got married. 

00:36:55
WILLIAM GLASSER He got married really young. 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:36:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Because you're family. 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN He's got umm… two kids who are pretty much grown. One is like 21, the other is like 18. 

00:37:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, kids aren't the factor, then. 

00:37:05
UNKNOWN No, no, umm… but it's just that he's got a kind of tendency, I think in his, his wife has passed away. 

00:37:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, so he's not divorced. His wife has died. He's a widower. 

00:37:20
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:37:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

00:37:20
UNKNOWN And I think that he was the one who was like the primarily decision maker, and you know… 

00:37:25
WILLIAM GLASSER In other words, his wife was relatively depended upon him to kind of run the show. Is that what you're saying? 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:37:35
WILLIAM GLASSER And you can see him… 

00:37:35
UNKNOWN Occasionally, he tries to do that with me and I'm just like. 

00:37:35
WILLIAM GLASSER You know about it. Yeah. It's your independence, you're gonna lose a little bit.

00:38:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, I do. I can do it. 

00:38:10
STEVE ANDREAS But, I hear a but in your voice. 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN But it's like a put on this, this front, you know of being happy and… 

00:38:20

00:38:30
Steve Andreas, MA 

00:38:30
Listening and Responding to Resistence 

00:38:35
STEVE ANDREAS So how would you like to feel about this? What can you say to yourself or how could you think about this so that uh… when confronted with bureaucracy, no you can't do that and so and so, so. You just go, oh, tell me more or something like that. Tell me what I need to do, you feel calm and so on and find your way through the system. 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN That's gonna be hard. Yeah but… 

00:39:00
STEVE ANDREAS You think, it's gonna be harder than blowing up and getting angry? 

00:39:05
UNKNOWN No, it's going to be hard to stop myself from blowing up and… 

00:39:10
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. And what would make it hard? 

00:39:15
UNKNOWN Because this habit, this form. 

00:39:15
STEVE ANDREAS Well, what we can do here is build you a new habit. 

00:39:20
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:39:20
STEVE ANDREAS We'll run off just the way you want it. Just as repetitive way and just as 100% is the habit, you've already got. That would be alright with you?

LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You keep going back into the store, it's about asking him, asking him. 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN I do. 

00:39:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And also you tell me about the nun who were kind to you before yeah, you got pushed away and you know, you, you did a really good thing by coming here tonight because you said, you're gonna start counseling and we need to help you get counseling and get support and get active support. Umm… it's just tremendously hard to leave the situations. What's the likelihood that you will be able to go? 

00:40:15
UNKNOWN I don't know. Probably the way I want to. 

00:40:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Part of you, what, what percent wants to? Is it 50-50 or you're right on the… 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN More than I want to, I need help. I know, I do. 

00:40:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH It's more than 50-50. 

00:40:25
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah. 

00:40:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Accept your… 

00:40:30
UNKNOWN There for me, you know, what's he saying, at least you took a step till you know go to counseling today. We should take steps instead of saying that you don't have nothing, no problems. 

00:40:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So you and Victor could move out into her upstairs apartment? 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN If, yeah, we can but… money, I mean… 

00:40:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So what did you say about being late on payments? 

00:40:50
UNKNOWN She's a little, there is gonna be people helping us out. She wasn't always be, you know, people to be behind me if I leave him, because you know, the people that cared about you, but they don't want to help you out because you're with him. 

00:41:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH I guess, you need to find out where those people are.

Assessment 

00:41:45
UNKNOWN Today, I'm would like to discuss with you the various ways to make an accurate diagnosis of the client's neurosis. First, of course, you must start with the free association. 

00:41:55
PAUL PELUSO What are you doing here? 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN I was giving a lecture. 

00:42:00
PAUL PELUSO But that's my job. 

00:42:00
UNKNOWN You've been looking tired lately. Why don't you sit down and have a rest. 

00:42:05
PAUL PELUSO Well, actually, all this filming has made me sleepy. 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. But why don't you tell me the first thing that comes to your mind? 

00:42:10
PAUL PELUSO Well, you know, I had this dream last night. Actually, I had this dream quite often. You see, I'm in a doctor's office and I just sit around waiting for ever and ever and nobody ever sees me. I just kept had all these tests and it's awful. 

00:42:25
UNKNOWN So you never get the help you need. 

00:42:30
PAUL PELUSO No, no it's frustrating. It's just test, test, test. Symptoms, symptoms, symptom, diagnosis, diagnosis, diagnosis. 

00:42:40
UNKNOWN Tell me about your mother? 

00:42:40
PAUL PELUSO Wait a minute. Are you psychoanalyzing me? Get out. 

00:42:45
UNKNOWN Here we see a classic example of a… 

00:42:50
PAUL PELUSO Out. Anyway. The truth is, there is a lot of emphasis that's placed on assessment and diagnosis and that makes sense. You go to a counselor or a doctor for a problem and you need to understand it appropriately. You need to know what the symptoms is, the diagnosis are etc., etc., etc. The problem though is that in our quest to be so good at accurately diagnosing things, we seem to forget the rest of the person and all the person becomes relegated to is a cluster of symptoms or a diagnosis. Now, one of the problems with our assessment and diagnostic system is that it leads to a one size fits all approach. Let's say that this jacket is a diagnosis of depression. Now we try it on Patricia here. Kind of fits but not really. Let's try it on Vanessa here. Yeah, doesn't fit very well either. And lastly let me try it on Lucy. Yeah, that definitely doesn't fit, does it? 

00:43:50
LUCY No. 

00:43:50
PAUL PELUSO Just like a piece of clothing needs tailoring so do does the treatment of clients. In fact, this is where good assessment comes in. It's like a tailor taking accurate measurements. Good assessment has both linear and non-linear elements to them. The linear elements are things like client's symptoms or diagnosis and the client's history. Non-linear elements include the client's readiness for change or their strengths or the theme of their particular story. You need both the linear and non-linear elements of assessment in order to tailor appropriate goals for treatment. We're gonna take a minute to talk about two non-linear elements. We'll be showing video examples of all of these in a minute but these two bare more explanation. 

00:44:35
Non-linear Assessment 

00:44:40
PAUL PELUSO First, there is readiness for change. That's right. Even clients who come into counseling saying that they wanting help, don't always come at the same level of readiness for change. In fact, two researchers Prochaska and DiClemente, came up with five different stages of change. Now, most people come in one of the first three stages of change. First, there is the pre-contemplation stage. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN Well, I don't have a problem. You do. 

00:45:05
PAUL PELUSO Then there is the contemplation stage. 

00:45:05
UNKNOWN Man I really got to quit these things. 

00:45:10
PAUL PELUSO Hey, there is no smoking in here. And the preparing for action stage. 

00:45:15
UNKNOWN I really had it. Last week was a lot strong and we need to do something about it. 

00:45:20
PAUL PELUSO So there you see, one size doesn't fit all and understanding that not everybody comes in to treatment with the same level of readiness for change can help you tailor the treatment for the client. So a non-linear way of doing it. But there is one more thing to consider. 

00:45:35
7 Themes 

00:45:35
PAUL PELUSO While each person comes in with you unique issues and concerns, there are some overlaps in people's stories of their problems that is useful and understanding their experience of the problem. In fact we categorize seven broad themes that these stories take. They are the theme of desperation or I have a problem that I need to work on. The theme of helplessness or the symptom is out of control. I can't help myself. The theme of hopelessness. I have a chronic problem. The theme of defensiveness. Who or what is the problem because it's not me. The theme of exhaustion. Being overwhelmed. The theme of despair. The experience of loss and the theme of fear and confusion or double binds. So how do these things affect assessment and treatment? Well, consider these two examples. They both have the same diagnosis, say depression. But there are different changes of change. There is the pre-contemplation stage. 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN Well, I don't have a problem. 

00:46:40
PAUL PELUSO And she has the theme of defensiveness. 

00:46:40
UNKNOWN My boyfriend is a total jerk. If he would only get his act together, he'll much better. 

00:46:45
PAUL PELUSO And then consider this example. She's in the preparing for action stage. 

00:46:50
UNKNOWN I really had it. Last week was the last straw. I'm ready to do something about it. 

00:46:55
PAUL PELUSO And she has the theme of fear and confusion or double bind. 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN My boss is a complete jerk and I want to quit. But the money is really good. But if I don't leave, I'll go crazy. But there are no jobs in the area right now. 

00:47:15
PAUL PELUSO Now knowing what we know about tailoring treatment, we have to have different goals for these two people. So for example, you know, what if we try to find a way to not let your boyfriend's choice of behavior affect your mood? If we could disrupt that and not have him bring you down, then he'd have to make some different decisions about what he does. 

00:47:35
UNKNOWN I think it's worth a shot. After all he really needs help. 

00:47:35
PAUL PELUSO That's a pretty good start especially for somebody in the pre-contemplation stage and for you, I know, you really can't make a change right now but what if we could try to find some ways to improve your situation a little bit and then get you ready so that when a new opportunity comes, you can really move on it. 

00:47:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, I think, we could do that. I really like that. 

00:48:00
PAUL PELUSO So, now you've seen a good overview of the domain of assessment. The linear and non-linear elements to it and how they come together to make up good goals for therapy. Now, let's take a look at some video examples in various clinical settings. 

00:48:15

Readiness for Change 

00:48:20
"Is it OK to liberate it to go where it needs to go?" 

00:48:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And if we're gonna judge on a scale, where one is completely false and seven is completely true, how true does it feel, not what your head is saying, what your gut is saying? 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN That there was no problem. About two. 

00:48:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Two. Okay. Now let us start counting the pieces together, okay. So holding an image in your mind, and hold that negative belief, I've failed. It's my fault, okay and what emotions comes up? 

00:49:05
[sil.] 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN Anger. 

00:49:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Anger. Okay. In an order of scale, zero to ten, where zero is neutral and ten is the worst feeling, you can imagine, how does it feel? 

00:49:20
UNKNOWN Hate. 

00:49:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. And where do you feel that in your body? 

00:49:25
UNKNOWN In the gut. 

00:49:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. 

00:49:30
Sue Johnson, Ph.D. 

00:49:30
Assessment 

00:49:35
SUE JOHNSON Or maybe it's not at that level yet. You help me. 

00:49:35
UNKNOWN I think, we're only just now beginning to, we're able to slow it down. 

00:49:40
SUE JOHNSON Really get it. 

00:49:40
UNKNOWN Umm… you know, we just recently read the book and that shed a lot of light on things but typically, we need a little bit of cool off time, maybe the next morning or you know, a space of time before we could repair whatever went wrong in the given circumstance. 

00:50:00
SUE JOHNSON But, but you help me, you're saying Sue, it's still new, it's still sort of dealing with it, understanding it but I think, we are starting to have the ability to slow it down. Is that what you're saying? 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN Yes, but you know, when, when things are hot and passionate, we, we really couldn't stop it at that point. We need a little bit of time apart and you know, a chance to think it over what we are, what we are saying and what we are fighting about. What… 

00:50:30
SUE JOHNSON And then what you have that time can you guys come back? Can you come back and reach for each other? 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN It, we're getting better now uh… about it. 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN Much better. Much closer. 

00:50:40
UNKNOWN There was a, there was a point. 

00:50:40
SUE JOHNSON Stephanie, you agree that, yeah. 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN Yes, I don't think it escalates like he, that doesn't escalate to the point that it did.

Brad Keeney, Ph.D. 

00:50:50
Strengths and Resources 

00:50:50
"What did you used to do together…?" 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN … For her. That's my train of thinking. 

00:51:00
BRAD KEENEY So let's, in an analytical sense, assume that most of not all of this uh… performance that he creates uh… being a 38 year old, 15 year old is basically a way of, of acknowledging your skills as a mother. That puts you in the trap that you can't be his mother. 

00:51:20
UNKNOWN Yes. That's very true, very. 

00:51:20
BRAD KEENEY And that leads to all kinds of the weird things that are also being experienced. So let me ask you are there even five minutes in the course of the week where you don't feel like a mother to him where the two of you have truly? 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN There really is. 

00:51:35
BRAD KEENEY So let's think, what, if you, if you could only create, I don't know, five minutes, ten minutes, maybe that's too ambitious, maybe one minute where he did not relate to you as a, as a 38 year old, 15 year old and you did not relate to him with your mothering skills where the two of you met as equals on the way you did as a couple before you were married, before the funeral, before all these crazy wake, before all these things started to happen. What would it be? What could create that it would just be a moment. So anything. 

00:52:05
UNKNOWN I do honestly miss my having him to talk to. 

00:52:10
BRAD KEENEY Yeah. 

00:52:10
UNKNOWN When we met, we were soul mates. It still sometimes feel like I connect with him. We almost think, we almost think for each other at times. It sounds very weird. As much as I could strangle him at times. But I also feel like, reason to say, he's gonna say it. I don't know, we didn't really date for really long. We only date for six months before I married. 

00:52:30
BRAD KEENEY Where did you go for fun? Did you go to movies, did you go to restaurants, did you go bowling? 

00:52:35
UNKNOWN A bar. 

00:52:35
BRAD KEENEY A bar? Anything else? 

00:52:40
UNKNOWN Umm… we used to take a walk. We used to live downtown, but two blocks from Lake Michigan. We used to get up in the morning and we walk along the lake with Cappuccino. 

00:52:45
BRAD KEENEY So walking and coffee. 

00:52:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:52:45
BRAD KEENEY Okay. And bar? 

00:52:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. Bar was always fun for him never for me. 

00:52:50
BRAD KEENEY Okay. So what you both liked… 

00:52:55
UNKNOWN And spending time with his brother was always very important to him. We spend, we spent a lot of time with his brother before he and between the time I met him and the time he died. It's been a lot of time up there. 

00:53:05
BRAD KEENEY So where do you live now? If you, if you were to go for a walk where would you go, a place? 

00:53:10
UNKNOWN Well, we can go to the… of course walk path, we can go on the blocks. We can go almost anywhere. 

00:53:20
BRAD KEENEY And so how much time do you have in a week or a day to have for walking? 

00:53:25
UNKNOWN My husband, I can make time. I really could probably make time. 

00:53:30
BRAD KEENEY That would be too ambitious. 

00:53:30
UNKNOWN A few times, I'm sad, and we go to the park take care and walk over to the video store, don't really get out a lot when you have kids. Don't get it all, when you have kids. Walk over to the video store and again video for her, of course get around and they party in there, and a video each that we both liked and we watched videos and stuff like that, enjoyable day. 

00:53:55
BRAD KEENEY What is the last time, you walked together? 

00:54:00
UNKNOWN A couple of months. 

00:54:00
BRAD KEENEY When was the last time, you watched a video tape together? 

00:54:05
UNKNOWN I can't even sit down and watch a TV show together. Umm… I mean, for some reason, we don't seem to have the same interests in TV as we did when we were dating, I guess, you could say we were living together. 

00:54:20
BRAD KEENEY So it would be quite an initiative to decide which videotape you want. 

00:54:25
UNKNOWN But I also think, it will also be, when we first met, we didn't really watch TV, the videos. 

00:54:30
BRAD KEENEY Yeah. 

00:54:30
UNKNOWN We would go out and we would stay in and we would talk. We spent a lot of time communicating. 

00:54:35
BRAD KEENEY So the talking. 

00:54:35
UNKNOWN The talking is gone. The talking is gone. 

00:54:40
BRAD KEENEY But when you walked, it was present. 

00:54:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:54:40
BRAD KEENEY Yeah.

"Treasure Hunts…?" 

00:54:50
[sil.] 

00:54:55
BRAD KEENEY And you played practical tricks? Did you get a trick in the past and get things like that or was that something? 

00:55:00
UNKNOWN I've done little things like that where I've hidden things from him, made him go on a maize to find things. Me too though. My Christmas presents were always hidden so these little notes I have to go collect them. 

00:55:15
BRAD KEENEY That's fantastic. It's fantastic. So you all have a lot of knowledge that other couples would benefit from. 

00:55:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, I guess so. 

00:55:25
BRAD KEENEY You can figure out this mothering and wake business get passed that. 

00:55:30
UNKNOWN If we can pass all that. 

00:55:30
BRAD KEENEY Yeah, yeah, that's fascinating. Treasure hunts. 

00:55:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, treasure hunts. 

00:55:35
BRAD KEENEY Oh, that's excellent. So are you willing to announce that the shack is back. 

00:55:40
UNKNOWN I guess, I probably could do that.

00:56:10
UNKNOWN Uh… for me, it would be, we would have much more pleasant mornings. 

00:56:20

00:56:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:56:45

00:56:55
UNKNOWN Is that what I'm thinking? 

00:56:55
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:57:00
UNKNOWN Well, truly. I'm thinking, you're gonna help him. 

00:57:05
PAT LOVE It's an honest moment. 

00:57:10

JUDY BECK So can you tell me a little bit about what's going on in your life now? What are some problems you might want to work on tonight? 

00:57:55

00:58:15
JUDY BECK Yeah. 

00:58:15

JUDY BECK The sadness. 

00:58:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:58:50
JUDY BECK With that, do you think, we're connected with feelings of scared and unsure. 

00:58:55
UNKNOWN About that, just seeing her, just seeing her, she seem so different now. She just, she's saying the real, real sure patient now and what made me scared is just thought of losing her and just the thought of if I was wondering, okay, if not dead and when I'm dead, that a loss of, I feel like I've lost a lot of things, I don't know. Seem like things to start to go away and I was just scared that I'm just, I just feel scared. I feel like, that I might lose her and it scares me a lot.

01:00:05
[sil.] 

01:00:15
UNKNOWN Uh… you can't make it stop hurting. 

01:00:20
[sil.] 

01:00:25
UNKNOWN You know, it's just, I wanna make sure just stop hurting sometimes. 

01:00:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah. Okay. So you talked about that feeling like there was a hole. Does that go along with that feeling of pain? 

01:00:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:00:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. 

01:00:50
UNKNOWN So, it gets down, it hurts. 

01:00:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah, yeah. You know, mourning and grieving is a natural process when someone dies. But when a method can do that is, It can sometimes help take the knife out of the heart. So it can just make it softer. But it is a natural process to have. So I wouldn't want you to think that at the end of the hour, the goal would be that you wouldn't miss her. But if you were saying if we can deal with some of these, that we can, we can try that. Okay all right. And sometimes when somebody dies real suddenly…

01:02:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:02:05
[sil.] 

01:02:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So was it okay to just let it, Process where it needs to go. It's okay to liberate it, to go, what needs to go without doing it artificially.

Strengths and Resources 

01:04:20
UNKNOWN Discuss it, what was going on and communication. 

01:04:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

01:04:25
UNKNOWN It's like we have problems or even at work. It's just it lacked communication. 

01:04:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

01:04:30
UNKNOWN It, it seems like anyhow. It's just what I interpret it. It helps a lot just being able to talk with people. It's when I was in high school, I couldn't sit down and talk to nobody. I thought we were doing the night. I was a shy person, I couldn't talk to nobody and since I got into the construction business, really nobody I can talk to. 

01:04:50
SCOTT D. MILLER So that's even helped to the kind of work you do. Because… 

01:04:55
UNKNOWN I can, I can talk to anybody now. 

01:04:55
SCOTT D. MILLER I mean, how's that happened, I mean, a lot of people might have just said, having on that, I'm gonna get out of construction business. But you didn't do that. 

01:05:00
UNKNOWN It just started out, I was working at the top and I didn't really know a lot of people I was working with but just over the time, I got to know them good. 

01:05:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

01:05:10
UNKNOWN And then they also put me in charge of like public relations. A lot of people are gonna shut their water off and somebody come up, inspectors and stuff like that, I was had to deal with them people. 

01:05:20
SCOTT D. MILLER The people who were mad or the inspectors. 

01:05:25
UNKNOWN You know and after a while you just, you just learn to deal with people and you just don't let it bother you. Sometimes it's real tough. 

01:05:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

01:05:30
UNKNOWN Somebody is calling you and so be or something, you know, I'm sorry sir but I didn't, you know, we didn't plan on having the water main break but it happened and we'd try to get it back as soon as we can and we'll go from there. Sorry for the inconvenience, you know, and if we treat people good, most times, they'll treat you real good. You always get a few that don't but it keeps it interesting. there is no doubt. Because you don't know when they are gonna go knock on the door. Is this guy gonna rip me or is he gonna pass me a cup of coffee. You know. 

01:06:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Right. So you kind of overcome that, that challenge. 

01:06:05
UNKNOWN It's easy, you know, there is nothing to it. 

01:06:05
SCOTT D. MILLER But would you have said that, let's say about, let's say, you were the, let's say back into high school and you would have thought sort of imagine, that's the kind of work you would have been doing, I mean, what would have happened now? 

01:06:15
UNKNOWN That would have been a big chicken. I wouldn't work the door. I had a real hard time with it. It would have been real hard. 

01:06:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

01:06:25
UNKNOWN One day, we couldn't get…

01:06:30
Goal Setting 

01:06:30
"If we were successful today, what questions would have been answered…" 

01:06:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. All right well umm… I guess I want to start off with by asking you, you know, for our meeting today proved to be helpful to you. Umm… what, what questions will you have had answered or what changes might have occurred that umm… you know, you tried thing off, you would say well, you know, that was worthwhile? 

01:06:55
UNKNOWN Umm… I would say umm… maybe his concern here is that, that there seems to be a lot of anger and that I miss Tiffany and uh… I want her to be able to deal with that effectively. I don't want her to be lashing out at everybody and be angry at everybody and being angry at herself and, and umm… be able to because she, she, I've always told her since she was little that she's beautiful and that she's smart and that she can do anything and she's always had that self-esteem build up and I don't know what's just all of a sudden happened. And she has a father, her biological father who lives 20 minutes away and hasn't seen her in eight years. 

01:07:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN 20 minutes away and not in eight years? 

01:07:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:07:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN What, what gets in the way there? 

01:07:45
UNKNOWN He's a crack head.

Theme of Defensiveness 

01:07:50
"They don't listen. They never listen" 

01:08:00
UNKNOWN And that it's their fault and since they are the one to blame. 

01:08:10
STEVE ANDREAS Oh, you want to blame somebody. 

01:08:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. I want to yell at somebody, I want to scream at? 

01:08:15
STEVE ANDREAS What does, what does blaming do for you, blaming somebody else? 

01:08:15
UNKNOWN It makes people see what they did wrong. 

01:08:20
STEVE ANDREAS What if they are just following the rules, what are they doing wrong? 

01:08:25
UNKNOWN I'm not talking about just that situation, I'm talking about everything like other instance. 

01:08:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, now we'd like them to understand that there could be a different way of doing things that would be more respectful of you. 

01:08:35
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:08:35
STEVE ANDREAS Is that right? Okay, do you think they're gonna listen to you better if you blow up and get outraged at him or if you're calm> 

01:08:45
UNKNOWN If I was calm. 

01:08:45
STEVE ANDREAS I think so. So if you really want to change your bureaucracy or if you want to change some other situations let's say, somebody else is disrespectful of you. Would it be actually be easier if you can just be calm and centered and self-composed. You say look, I didn't like what you did. It doesn't fit for me. I want you to change it. 

01:09:10
UNKNOWN But they don't listen. They never listen. 

01:09:15
STEVE ANDREAS Sometimes they don't listen. Do you think, they are gonna listen better if you're angry or if you're calm? 

01:09:20
UNKNOWN Well, how about if I start off calm but then I get angry if they don't listen. 

01:09:20
STEVE ANDREAS You can always get angry, you know, you can do that right. We no need to taken away.

Theme of Exhaustion 

01:09:30
"I have so much on my plate right now…" 

01:09:35
UNKNOWN First of all, I don't know, what's gonna happen. Things are changing little fast. 

01:09:40
BRAD KEENEY So there are so many things going on. What do you think at the moment would be most useful for you in terms of focusing on something to, to help, help you sort out your life and to make things better for you? What would that be? 

01:09:55
UNKNOWN I don't know. I just have so much on my plate right now. I feel, I feel like it's a drinking problem then I feel like there is more to his drinking problem. Frank's brother passed away, excuse me, two weeks after we were married. His brother was his best friend, someone who he chatted a lot with, was very, very close with. He took it very, very hard. 

01:10:20
BRAD KEENEY So maybe this is a three year wake. 

01:10:20
UNKNOWN It could be a three year wake. He also has said that his parents, he was abused growing up that his father and I witnessed his father didn't know how to respect people. He doesn't know how to talk to people. So I think part of it comes from that. He's never really learnt how to talk to a woman and his dad talks down to his wife. So of course Frank, he knows it and then will talk down to me. I don't believe he wants to do it. I just believe, he doesn't know any difference. Maybe I'm trying to be on his side not on his side, but I'm trying to hope that he doesn't really think that down upon me. I don't know. 

01:11:00
BRAD KEENEY Got a couple of wild ideas. 

01:11:00
UNKNOWN Shoot them out, they can help. 

01:11:05
BRAD KEENEY You see, is there any where in the ballpark umm… that what you've said, it's possible that you truly are not only a good mother but an outstanding mother. 

01:11:15
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:11:15
BRAD KEENEY Yeah. That's part of the reason, I think that you came here, look how busy you are and you came in the midst of this, probably, largely because you would do almost anything to help, to help that child that you love. 

01:11:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, to bath to dinner, I ready everything. 

01:11:30
BRAD KEENEY Yep. See. I'm on the right track here. 

01:11:35
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:11:40
BRAD KEENEY Now, here obviously, even though he may not admit it, maybe not even to himself but he down deep knows too that you are a great mother and probably in some deep level knows and aware of the gifts that you bring to home life. So maybe, maybe he has some inner desire to learn how to be different in the home than the way that he experienced as a kid. You know…

WILLIAM GLASSER Sometimes everybody does know what's right for here but many times they don't. So how you actually uh… what's the problem over here that what's going in your life. You want to, where you are. 

01:12:40
UNKNOWN Well, see that's the whole thing, I don't know, I'm, I'm in a relationship right now with a wonderful man who also is to get married and I just, first reason, I just can't make that commitment. 

01:12:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, for some reason, it means, for some reason you don't want to do it. That's all. You're not breaking the law or anything like that. Uh… what is the relationship, is it living together, is it just seeing a lot, what is it? 

01:13:10
UNKNOWN No, actually, it's a long distance relationship and umm… my schedule, I'm taking, I'm working on masters right now and I have a little few things in the fire. So I can't see him as much and it's starting to take the toll on the way things are going and umm… it's this constant pressure, you know, to make that, to make up my mind and make a decision. 

01:13:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, I see. So how far away, is he?

PAUL PELUSO Oh, hi there. You know, I was just thinking about, when I was a kid, there was this guy on children's TV. He used to talk right into the camera to the boys and girls. He had a neighborhood that would welcome them into and he had a way of connecting with them and making them feel special. He would talk with them about their feelings. He had puppets and he also had a land of make believe that he would welcome them into. In fact, the funny thing is, he had the same last name as doctor Carl Rogers. He invented person centered therapy in the 1940s. Doctor Roger believed that the other dominant approaches of the day didn't really look at the whole person. Analysts saw patients as a collection of neurosis and diagnosis while behaviorists saw them as merely stimuli and responses. Doctor Rogers believed that the entire person needed to be considered when treating them. And just like Mr. Rogers, Dr. Rogers believes that relating to the person was very important. In fact, he believed that's all that you needed for change. That's it. Empathy, genuineness and unconditional positive regard. Now, while Dr. Rogers' methods were and still are influential today, those core conditions were not all you needed in order to be successful in therapy. However the strength and the quality of the therapeutic relationship is a powerful predictor of treatment success. And in addition, it's what all master practitioners use and that's why we're going to talk about it here. So come on all into the neighborhood of make believe and we're going to learn more about the therapeutic relationship.

01:16:15

01:16:20
JESSICA LOL, I know for real right. 

01:16:25
JENNA I'm Jenna. 

01:16:25
JESSICA My name is Jessica but every calls me Alie. 

01:16:30
JENNA Stop, just stop. Seriously, my real name is Alie but all my friends call me Jenna. 

01:16:35
JESSICA No, way. 

01:16:35
JENNA Way. 

01:16:35
JESSICA No way. 

01:16:40

01:16:40
JESSICA No, you're fabulous.

JESSICA G. Besties forever. 

01:16:50
PAUL PELUSO Where was that in the script? Where did that come from? You know, anyway. Although that wouldn't have been my first choice for a demonstration, it naturally does exemplify what happens when you're building any kind of relationship. A therapeutic relationship is just like any other kind of relationship when two people come together and connect cognitively and emotionally around some common goal. Now in therapy, it's usually around increasing client's functioning or helping them to resolve a problem. Unlike friendships though, the therapeutic relationship is a professional relationship and it does have limitations called boundaries. And we'll have more to say about that later. But next the empathy and you know, for that I think we need some tunes. Empathy, it literally means to feel with another person. Now according to Dr. Rogers here, it occurs when a client shares their story and a therapist feels what the client is feeling by using their own interpretation of their experiences. Now they don't lose sight of the fact that it's their interpretation and not actually what the client is feeling but it gives them a window into their emotional world. It's kind of like, let me demonstrate with these tuning forks here. If you bang one on a hard surface, it will vibrate at a certain frequency and make a pitch. Now if you take this and bring it closer to another one, the other one will begin to vibrate as well. There is a principle in physics known as sympathetic vibration. So the vibrations travel across the air from one work to the other but they vibrate with one another and that's because they are in tune or in sync with one another. Now if you take another fork, that's not in tune or in sync, it will not vibrate. Well, it's very similar with clients in therapy with therapists. Therapists feel certain emotional sympathetic vibration with the client. Understanding this fosters a sense of you get me in the client and allows for the therapeutic relationship to grow and develop. Without it the job becomes much more difficult if not impossible. So how did it work when you guys first got together? Did he ask you out? 

01:19:05
UNKNOWN No. I had to ask him out. 

01:19:05
PAUL PELUSO You had to ask him out. 

01:19:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:19:05
UNKNOWN Oh, tell me about that. 

01:19:10
UNKNOWN Well, we, we met through friends and we went out as a group a couple of times but he never made a move so finally one day, I asked him if he wanted to go to the movies and it just went from there. 

01:19:25
PAUL PELUSO Okay, all right. So, so what was the moment? How, how did he sweep you off your feet? How are he win you over? 

01:19:30
UNKNOWN Well, he did some really sweet things. He would come over with flowers. He'd work on my car for me. Umm… he would come, he cooked dinner sometimes. He's a really good cook. 

01:19:40
PAUL PELUSO And that doesn't happen very much anymore? 

01:19:45
UNKNOWN No. yes, he, he is a good cook. He just, we don't really do it anymore. 

01:19:50
PAUL PELUSO You look sad when you said that. Can you tell me what's behind that? What was going through in your mind? 

01:20:00
UNKNOWN We used to be happier. I used to be happier. Now everything is a mess. 

01:20:10
Therapeutic Relationship Issues: Transference and Countertransference 

01:20:10
UNKNOWN Transference and countertransference. 

01:20:15
PAUL PELUSO Yes. Go ahead. 

01:20:15
UNKNOWN This is my favorite. Transference is emotions or thoughts like a traction patient unconsciously faces on analyst, particularly dealing with some mazo and franzo(ph). This must be done by… 

01:20:30
PAUL PELUSO Well, that maybe all well and good. We prefer to think of transference as any thoughts or feelings that are perceived from the client to the therapist that are outside the therapeutic relationship which must be interpreted and brought back into the therapeutic relationship. 

01:20:40
UNKNOWN Is this not just what I said? 

01:20:45
PAUL PELUSO It is but I like my definition better. Let's take a look at an example. 

01:20:50
UNKNOWN You know, I feel so comfortable talking to you. It's like we are friends forever. I wish we could go out or get a coffee and hang out sometime. 

01:20:55
UNKNOWN I can appreciate how you feel. We've done some really good work in here the past few weeks. You shared some really personal things with me. But you know, this relationship can't go any farther than that. 

01:21:05
UNKNOWN I know. 

01:21:05
UNKNOWN I can hear you're disappointed and I can hear the wish that you would like to have a relationship like you have in here with someone out there in the other areas of your life. So why don't we spend some time discussing this. 

01:21:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, I like that. 

01:21:20
PAUL PELUSO Now, that was a good example of using those wishes or feelings and feeding them back into the therapeutic relationship. 

01:21:30
UNKNOWN I noticed, she wasn't lying down. 

01:21:30
PAUL PELUSO We've been through this. You really need to let that go. Anyway, on to. 

01:21:35
UNKNOWN Countertransference. 

01:21:40
PAUL PELUSO Yes, go on. 

01:21:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. Countertransference is the thoughts and emotions that the analyst has toward the client. Typically, this maybe things like aggression or affectionate dialogue. 

01:21:50
PAUL PELUSO Oh, all right. There maybe some of that but not always in all cases. We define countertransference as any thoughts or feelings emotions that proceed from the therapist to the client which if appropriate should be reanalyzed, reinterpreted and put back into the therapeutic relationship. 

01:22:10
UNKNOWN This is the last straw. Unacceptable. Who has countertransference issues huh. Anyway, this in truth to what he said. Going back to the tuning fork's metaphor for a moment, if the client is telling their story, uh… awakens or arouses some emotions in you, then you're going to interpret through your own experience. So if the client talks about their own experiences of death or loss, it might cause the therapist to access their experiences of death or loss. Now, if they've dealt with these feelings appropriately, that's one thing but if they haven't dealt with those feelings, then they may overwhelm the therapist and they may project them on to the client. Now this would be wrong and this would be a violation of an important boundary and if that happens, they need to address that in their own supervision or possibly even their own therapy. Now let's consider the other option. What if the therapist has dealt with their feelings already? Well, then the feelings that they get from the client can be used as a window into the client's emotional world and can help to broaden or deepen the conversation. So this can be done in a variety of ways. But let's take a look at example like this. 

01:23:20
UNKNOWN I know, it's been six months since my mom died and everyone wants me to move on and be okay. But I'm not, it's not okay, she's not here. 

01:23:25
UNKNOWN So people are putting pressure on you not to grieve or not to grieve so openly and you don't think that's fair to you? 

01:23:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, it's like they don't even want to admit that she was here and now she's gone and I'm just to accept that as part of life. Not okay, it's not fair. 

01:23:40
UNKNOWN You know, as you're talking, I can hear the sadness and anger. But it seems like there is something else there too. It feels like there is an emptiness in your life that your mother used to fill. 

01:23:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, that's a good word for it. Exactly. Emptiness. 

01:24:00
PAUL PELUSO And that's a good example of using countertransference feelings to deepen the conversation and strengthen the relationship. But sometimes it doesn't always go that smoothly. Sometimes in order to strength their therapeutic relationship, you have to risk it as well. Oh, I've got to go take care of something. Come with me. Oh, sorry, I had this leaky pipe I had to fix. Good as new, you know, my guy was right. There is nothing that duct tape can't fix. Say, you know, this pipe kind of reminds me of the therapeutic relationship we have been talking about. It connects the therapist to the client and all the thoughts and information and emotion flow in between them. And like pipes in the ground or in the wall, there can be pressure on the outside or inside that cause, that cause it to rupture or cause it to burst open. For example, the clinician may have to point out something that the client is doing that is disruptive or may even be dangerous. The client may not like this and feel that the trust is gone or the good feelings for therapy go away. Now sometimes, this can burst open in an angry outburst or sometimes, it's sort of a drip, drip, drip like a slow leak. Either way whenever this is detected by the therapist, they have to stop what they are doing right there and become a plumber and fix it. Now, there are few steps to dealing with a therapeutic rupture that are just like fixing a pipe. First thing you do is the equivalent of shutting off the water which is stopping what is going on in therapy right there and address the rupture behavior that could be the aggression or that could be the passive aggression. The second thing you do is you locate the leak. That would be exploring the client's feelings, of a client's behaviors. Now in this step, you have to also take some ownership of whether or not you didn't pick up on something or whether you weren't able to address something that the client wanted to. Oftentimes, this can provide some information about the client's unmet needs or unmet wishes that are in the therapy. Finally, you have to patch the leak and this means incorporating some of these new wishes and new goals into the therapy and possibly changing the course of therapy or altering some of those therapeutic goals. And just like a pipe that's repaired, oftentimes a therapeutic relationship that is repaired for a rupture can be stronger than it was before. Now how is that for non-linear. 

01:26:25
UNKNOWN No, honestly no connection at all but umm… my fiancé seems to think there is a connection. Things have been kind of difficult between me and her umm… for the past six months. 

01:26:35
PAUL PELUSO Six months. What, what's happened in the last six months? 

01:26:40
UNKNOWN Well, my father passed away. 

01:26:40
PAUL PELUSO Oh, wow, wow. So you, you had another loss of a parent. 

01:26:45
UNKNOWN Yup. 

01:26:45
PAUL PELUSO Was that sudden or had he been ill? 

01:26:50
UNKNOWN It was completely sudden. He was blind sided by a truck at a stoplight and uh… died instantly. 

01:26:55
PAUL PELUSO Oh wow, umm… I'm really sorry uh… again. What was your relationship like with your dad? 

01:27:00
UNKNOWN Well, he was, he's like my hero. He's my best friend umm… we used to talk all the time. Uh… I mean, it's, it's huge. 

01:27:10
PAUL PELUSO So you think this loss was as painful as the loss of your mom before? 

01:27:15
UNKNOWN What kind of question is that? A loss is a loss, I mean, losing a parent is something that's immeasurably painful. How could you ask if one is more painful than the other. 

01:27:25
PAUL PELUSO You know, you're right. That was really a stupid question. That didn't come out the way that I've, I've wanted it to umm… I'm sorry. Umm… you know, I don't know what it was like for you. I haven't lost my parents yet. Umm… but I had worked with a lot of people who have and it, it's always painful and for some people who have you know, difficult relationships with their parents, it can carry, you know, it create a lot of baggage and they carry that with them for a long time. You know, it sounds like you at least have the benefit of a good relationship with your dad, when he passed. 

01:27:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, it was good, you know, I just miss him sometimes, you know. I want to call him but I can't and it's feel like I have been kicked in the gut. 

01:28:05
PAUL PELUSO Well, we have explored the basics of the therapeutic relationship but there is so much more to it. We'll have some video examples coming up that will explore each of these in some detail. Watch for how clinicians use empathy to build the therapeutic relationship as well as for instances of transference and countertransference. Oh, also pay attention to therapeutic ruptures as well. And remember, the most important thing in helping somebody is to make them feel special, valued and cared for. Bye for now.

01:31:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:31:10

01:32:35
PAT LOVE When I saw both of your faces coming this. 

01:32:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:32:35
PAT LOVE And that's, yeah, that's the part we want to protect. You know, we want to protect that preciousness and uh… so how can we, yeah, well what as you, as you look at Joe and you tell…

"I can feel the motivation…" 

01:33:00
PAT LOVE Because, because it's, am I making up stuff? Because you said, I want a more pleasurable morning. 

01:33:05
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:33:05
PAT LOVE And if you can have your heart open and have you know, greatitude. 

01:33:10
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:33:10
PAT LOVE And have, you know, because I think you're all both sort of want the same thing. You want to live in harmony with each other. 

01:33:20
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:33:20
PAT LOVE You know, and you want to be supportive to her, you want to be supportive to him. 

01:33:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:33:25
PAT LOVE I mean, I can feel the motivation, too bad, we don't have the camera here because your faces are just radiant at times when I see you talking you know to each other or having these feelings. So mere validation in to that, one more thing…

UNKNOWN They put to mine and do it, you know. 

01:33:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

01:33:50
UNKNOWN You're not or the two. And I hear that work too. 

01:33:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

01:33:55
UNKNOWN This way, it's true. 

01:34:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay, so it takes you sometimes to make a decision. You eventually make the decision. 

01:34:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:34:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

01:34:05
UNKNOWN And I try to weigh out situations which is the best way. 

01:34:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. May not always be right but it makes it tough sometimes. 

01:34:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. So you're the kind of guy who carefully weighs the decisions, considers the options. 

01:34:20
UNKNOWN Tries to. 

01:34:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. Sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't work, of course. 

01:34:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, sometimes you want it better off just to go with your gut feeling and go for it. 

01:34:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. You do that sometimes? 

01:34:25
UNKNOWN Once in a while. But it fails sometimes, I always screwed up. 

01:34:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. So that's somehow, when you've done that, the results aren't as. 

01:34:35
UNKNOWN They are not as good. 

01:34:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

01:34:40
UNKNOWN Plans get changed. You had all these planned out to go and you don't go. If somebody told you ranch in a pile and that was set. 

01:34:50
SCOTT D. MILLER You didn't plan careful enough. 

01:34:50
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:34:50
SCOTT D. MILLER That's the sort of thought that come and maybe then you think, I should plan more carefully enough. 

01:35:00
Scott D. Miller, Ph.D.

01:35:05
UNKNOWN We know, what problem is we are both just exhausted. 

01:35:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

01:35:05
UNKNOWN And that, you know, like then we go from there. 

01:35:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. Once you're able to get sort of the thing. 

01:35:10
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:35:10
SCOTT D. MILLER And then mutual understanding, break that communication, I don't know stoppage or back up umm… then, then it moves on and things are cool. 

01:35:25
UNKNOWN Right, it usually works out real good. Like last weekend, we had both problem because, we got up, we were supposed to go out fishing that morning and it was raining and so they didn't want to go fishing. But my mother was planning on going fishing, if she would, Nancy want to go as well. Tell you what? 

01:35:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Let me try to get this. Nancy wanted to go. 

01:35:45
UNKNOWN No, shopping. 

01:35:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Shopping, okay. Because of the rain, she didn't want to sit in the room. Okay, all right, all right. 

01:35:50
UNKNOWN And I was kind of planning on them to go fishing with me and I was gonna go in, dinner or whatever, you know. 

01:35:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Have a good time. 

01:35:55
UNKNOWN Right. But they changed the whole plan, they just go and you know, I'm doing well, I want to do, you do what you want to do. But it worked out real good. 

01:36:05
SCOTT D. MILLER It did. 

01:36:05
UNKNOWN They come back, pick me up at 3:30, we went on and had a real nice dinner. 

01:36:10
SCOTT D. MILLER And they dropped you off at the spot. 

01:36:10
UNKNOWN They dropped me off with a boat in the lake and I went off and did my thing with fishing all day and they come back and hooked up to the trader, when I get back and they were when I come in, they were ready to go. About town, cleaned up, went out for nice stake dinner and everything moving just quick as a whistle. 

01:36:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Now that Have turned into a problem in the past. 

01:36:30
UNKNOWN Could have, yeah. 

01:36:30
SCOTT D. MILLER What was different? How come, you know, this time. 

01:36:30
UNKNOWN We discuss it, what was going on and communication.

01:36:40
STEVE ANDREAS Maybe with somebody who is bugged you in the past or something like that. 

01:36:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:36:45
STEVE ANDREAS Run through a future possibility. Close your eye's, let's imagine somebody blocks you in that way… 

01:36:55
[sil.] 

01:37:00
STEVE ANDREAS This is a road test. 

01:37:00
UNKNOWN I'm angry. 

01:37:00
STEVE ANDREAS You're angry? 

01:37:00
UNKNOWN I'm angry. 

01:37:05
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. And what does the angry part want for you? 

01:37:10
UNKNOWN He wants me to hurt that part like they hurt me. 

01:37:15
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. So there is hurt underneath this. 

01:37:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:37:15
STEVE ANDREAS It have been blocking you. Now what's, what's the root of that? This came from a long time ago? Can you hear it in this way? 

01:37:30
UNKNOWN About a month, about a month ago? 

01:37:30
STEVE ANDREAS A month ago. So is there a particular person who hurt you initially. 

01:37:35
UNKNOWN My Ex. 

01:37:35
STEVE ANDREAS Your Ex. Great, let's do a different thing now. Would you be interested in reaching forgiveness with this person? 

01:37:45
UNKNOWN I didn't do anything wrong. 

01:37:50
STEVE ANDREAS No. I believe you. And forgiveness isn't for the other person, it's for you. So you wouldn't have to be have the feelings of hurt or anger or resentment, revenge. 

01:38:05
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:38:05
STEVE ANDREAS Is there anything would be of interest to you? 

01:38:10
UNKNOWN I want to let it go. 

01:38:10
STEVE ANDREAS You would like to let it go? 

01:38:10
UNKNOWN Bugging me everyday. 

01:38:15
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, yeah, that's the problem with it and that's, that's why forgiveness is particularly useful in situations like this. Okay…

01:38:30
UNKNOWN Both anger a part of you know, put the problem at bay you know. 

01:38:35
SUE JOHNSON Right, but now you are starting to realize that underneath that, there was a whole other level of feeling, yeah. 

01:38:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:38:40
SUE JOHNSON So, if you take that, press the elevator button and go down in that elevator into those softer, deeper feelings, the image that comes up for you, you, you help me, by the way guys, if I say something umm… that isn't quite right for you and doesn't quite fit for you, I want you to correct me, okay. I want you to say no, Sue, it's not quite right there. It's more like this because I'm gonna make mistakes, all right. Okay and you, you're the expert on what's going on with you, okay. 

01:39:10
UNKNOWN Sure, we are. 

01:39:10
SUE JOHNSON All right, so if you take that elevator down and you go into the, the softer feelings that you would never let yourself maybe even feel when you were being strong and silent. The image that comes up for you is a baby crying, yeah.

Schemas 

01:40:05
[sil.] 

01:40:10
PAUL PELUSO Schemas and their dynamics. Whether you refer to them as schemas, attachment styles, internal working models, lifestyle or more commonly personality. These are essentially guides or maps. Like maps, they are great for helping you get to where you want to go. They tell you the best way to get there or how to find your way, if you get lost or turn around. Schemas are the maps that we've created to guide us through life. They contain our view of self, view of others and view of the world and for the most part, they can be very helpful or even essential. The only problem is that they aren't based in reality but on our perceptions of reality and like the best maps or devices, sometimes they can be just plain wrong and blinding following a map can be hazardous. Schemas dynamics can be classified as globally positive or globally negative. You know, people will see the glass as half empty or half full. So some people will feel good about themselves, good about others or good about the world or they may see themselves as feeling negative about themselves, negative about others or negative about the world. And then the combinations like maybe they feel negative about themselves or positive about others and negative about the world or they feel positive about themselves and others but feel negative about the world or negative about others and the world and positive about themselves or well, you get the picture, it gets kind of complicated. But one thing about the schemas dynamics is that they are our road map. They are our best route from getting from point A to point B. They contain all of the landmarks and mountains and routes along the way. And the most important thing is that they are uniquely ours. So how do we develop these maps or schemas. 

01:42:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:42:05
PAUL PELUSO Actually, yeah, yeah we do. We develop them with our early experience with our parents and with our siblings and how to best get along. 

01:42:10
UNKNOWN Ends you at a complex and eat and ego, and super ego and… 

01:42:15
PAUL PELUSO I'm not sure about all of that. But it is from these early experiences that we learn from our parents, as well as siblings and friends and teachers and in school. If we can rely on ourselves or for hapless. If we can rely on other people or who should we be suspicious or if we can rely on the world. If the world is a safe place or if it's a scarely and unpredictable. All of these things feed into our schemas dynamics. And these dynamics can be either globally positive or negative. About themselves or others or the world around them. And once these schema dynamics become set, they become our go to strategies when we get into new situations or circumstances. So for example, if your family is large and you got your needs met by being compliant or by being co-opperative when in your new situation, you're going to use the same strategies. Or for example if you got your needs met by taking charge or being in control, then when you get into a new situation, you're going to do the same thing, take charge, be in control. Our schema dynamics are kind of like cookie cutters that we get from these experiences in the family of origin. But we don't stamp out into the dough of life. Let's say this is our positive view of self and this is a negative view of others and we stamp them out and that allows us to make sense of the world around us. Now we know how to act, now we know how to behave. Now, the problem is that when we too rigidly apply our schema dynamics, we try force people to be the way that we think they should be rather than the way that they are. And this can create problems. Oh, hi, sorry, it's one of my favorites. You know, stories are important to master practitioners. Clients come into therapy with their own stories and usually casting themselves in the role of the hero. Sometimes there are villains or plot twist, sometimes the story is a drama, sometimes it's a romance, sometimes it's a tragedy, sometimes it's a comedy. The point is that knowing a client's schema dynamics is like knowing a character in a story. You know, how they are likely going to act and react. Well, with a client's schema dynamics, it's the same thing. You're likely gonna know how they are gonna act or react in a given situation except with a client, you can also alter or change their schema dynamics. How you say, well, there is a lot of different ways but one of the most powerful ways is the use of metaphors. Metaphors are a way of taking complicated ideas or concepts and translating them into something that is easily understood by people. You can use all sorts of things like symbols or even stories. In fact, in this video series, we have used metaphors to explain linear and non-linear listening and responding, aspects of assessment and developing and maintaining therapeutic relationships. In fact, this reminds me of one of my favorite medical dramas which have this cranky but brilliant doctor. 

01:45:20
[music] 

01:45:25
UNKNOWN Okay, people, we have a difference of diagnosis on this case. Patient is a white male. Keeps getting passed over for promotions at work. Boss says, he's not aggressive enough. His wife is overbearing and domineering. Says he never speaks up for himself. Recently he started staying home all the time because he's afraid if he goes outside, he's gonna catch the ebola virus. Ideas people, come on. 

01:45:45
UNKNOWN Depression. 

01:45:50
UNKNOWN It doesn't explain the fear of ebola virus. 

01:45:50
UNKNOWN Delusion disorder. 

01:45:55
UNKNOWN Doesn't explain the domineering wife. 

01:45:55
UNKNOWN Lupus. Oh, come on, means I won all the time, it's got to work one of these days. 

01:46:05
UNKNOWN It's almost never Lupus. 

01:46:05
UNKNOWN You're an idiot. He's becoming so scared he may never come out again. 

01:46:10
UNKNOWN Avoidant personality disorder with depressed features. 

01:46:10
UNKNOWN Exactly. Now all we need to do is make turtle man feel safe enough to come out of his shell and if we don't, the next stop on this turtle train is full blown house bound agoraphobia. 

01:46:20
UNKNOWN Well, I still think it's Lupus. 

01:46:20
UNKNOWN You're an idiot. 

01:46:25
PAUL PELUSO But how to schemas change actually? How can metaphors literally change a client's schema from positive to negative? I wish I had a convenient way of describing it. I wish I had a story I could tell. Well, wait a minute, you know, the story of green eggs and ham is a great way of describing the difference between assimilation and accommodation which is how you change schemas. Assimilation is when you just add new knowledge or new information to an existing schema whereas accommodation is when you literally change the actual schema dynamics themselves. How does this happen in the story. Well, you remember in the story, there is the main character who actually doesn't even have a name. And then there is the character of Sam-I-am. Now the main character has what you would call a negative schema of green eggs and ham, they don't like green eggs and ham. And Sam-I-am is trying to get him to change it and he presents him with all sorts of new scenarios, would you eat it with a goat, would you eat it with a boat, would you eat it with a, you know, the story. The point is that all of that adds new information to the main characters negative schema of green eggs and ham. Now, by the end of the story, Sam-I-am actually does get into change it. And the main character finds that he likes green eggs and ham. In other words, it's like he changes his schema of green eggs and ham from negative to positive. His whole approach, his whole world view changes. That is accommodation and that produces the kind of lasting change that can positively impact client's lives. So let's take a look at some video examples of client's discussing elements of their life. See if you can pick out their schema dynamics, their view of self, view of others or view of the world. See how they use those schema dynamics to stamp out the dough of life. Look for signs of accommodation and assimilation and the use of metaphors. Well, I still have to find out. See if this map will do. 

01:48:35
UNKNOWN Idiot.

01:49:25
UNKNOWN Go away. 

01:49:25
STEVEN HAYES Actually out loud. 

01:49:30
UNKNOWN Umm… no, probably not. That's probably how what I decided was the right thing to do, just be quiet, be invisible, go away. 

01:49:45
[sil.] 

01:49:50
STEVEN HAYES Okay. Like in order for you to be yourself, have a sense, you're gonna have to deal with mom, yeah. What she have to say about this. What did she have to say about you.

[sil.] 

01:51:15
UNKNOWN Um… I try to be quiet or go not spend much time with people, you know, just minimize my presence, try to be funny or light or not umm… heavy in anyway. Umm… just not take up much space like us. Umm… or you know, it's just a very light touch, very light sort of. 

01:51:45
STEVEN HAYES Okay. Is it right to say, if you're in relationship with others, some of what she pulls from you is what shows up in these interactions. I hear some like you shouldn't be so giggly and loud, loud if you're….

01:52:10
WILLIAM GLASSER It's not a desperation thing. 

01:52:15
UNKNOWN No. no but he said that it would be my call but I don't know. Umm… I just don't know, I mean, I've had a lot of umm… disappointments in the past and I've been around a lot of bad relationships in my life growing up I've seen you know. 

01:52:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Uncles, aunts and cousins and… 

01:52:30
UNKNOWN Grandmother and grandfather and everything. And I don't, well, yeah they did, I mean, I remember, I didn't know that. I thought, for the longest time that married people weren't supposed to talk. I really thought that. 

01:52:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. Well, they are not. 

01:52:45
UNKNOWN I guess and I went over to my friend's house. 

01:52:50
WILLIAM GLASSER It breaks the rules, if they talk. 

01:52:50
UNKNOWN Yes. And I went over to my friend's house and like her parents were speaking to each other and I was amazed because I didn't, you know, that's how my family was. I didn't know they talked. 

01:53:00
WILLIAM GLASSER You're an only child of a mother and father who didn't talk a great deal either. 

01:53:05
UNKNOWN Umm… no my parents were divorced when I was very young and we lived with my grandmother and my grandfather. My mum and I did. And they didn't talk at all. 

01:53:10
WILLIAM GLASSER I see. So you didn't have any real big long term closeness with your father, than to. 

01:53:15
UNKNOWN No, not at all. 

01:53:15
WILLIAM GLASSER I see and your mother hasn't remarried?

01:53:30
UNKNOWN Umm…, I think now but they've had their rough spots and… 

01:53:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, everybody has their rough spots but compared to your grand parents. Yeah, it's pretty good. 

01:53:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, exactly. And umm… you know, I don't know if it's just that through example that I don't know. 

01:53:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, it's good, you don't know. What's the hurry. 

01:53:55
UNKNOWN No, it's, I feel like, you know, I also try and please people and I feel like I would be making everybody happy if I just did those but I don't know.

"You'd need to fly… You'd need to come down to Earth…" 

01:54:10
PEGGY PAPP I was really impressed with your fantasies and uh… I went out and thought about them for a few minutes and umm… the thing that struck me was that you both saw her as a bird. 

01:54:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:54:30
PEGGY PAPP And uh… you both saw him on the ground somehow I mean very uh… uh… connected with the ground. 

01:54:40
UNKNOWN The earth. 

01:54:45
PEGGY PAPP And umm… since you have both said that uh… you would like to change this pattern of missing each other, we were thinking that umm… in order for you not to feel so responsible and so burdened and so, you know, weighted down with everything. That what would you need to do would be to fly every now and then to learn to. 

01:55:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, but you know, when I flew, it came back, you know, strain up when I come back because it's, it will be all disarray. 

01:55:20
PEGGY PAPP Well, not necessarily. You could learn to fly just a little bit and just kind of soar a little bit and so that what would be just kind of nice and the thing that we are, I was thinking that uh… you would need to do uh… in order to be more responsible would you say would be to come down to earth more and to be by his side and…

UNKNOWN It seems a lot of times I second guess myself all the time, you know, I'm not really sure exactly which way to move without constantly replaying things in my head. 

01:56:15
[sil.] 

01:56:20
UNKNOWN Or you know, it just seems like I'm kind of stuck in a gutter, you know and can't get out and so… 

01:56:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Stuck in terms of your ability to do what? 

01:56:30
UNKNOWN Functional a lot of times. It seems like it, it weighs me down and uh… you know, Mary and I have a few children and it seems to affect them also, you know. Umm… whether there is an emotional distance a lot of times. You know. 

01:56:50
MICHAEL YAPKO How do those, how do those kinds of past experiences become a basis for emotional distance in your own family? 

01:57:00
UNKNOWN Because it seems whether I talk to people or things, you know, there is a lot of times, there could be facial expressions that people make or smells or just anything. That seems like, pictures click, when that happens. And somebody may say something whatever and then for a long time after I get home, I may just be in another world, you know, just thinking, you know. 

01:57:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Just thinking about it, thinking about it. 

01:57:30
UNKNOWN A little of both, you know. And then I always, you know, thinking well, maybe I should better different. 

01:57:35
MICHAEL YAPKO All right, so when you say those kinds of things for yourself then what happens? 

01:57:45
UNKNOWN I seem to get caught up in it you know. Umm… 

01:57:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Do you always feel that kind of running commentary going on through your mind? That kind of evaluation about yourself that kind of assessment about how you're doing and what you said and what you did and do you always pay attention…

"There doesn't have to be safety in the world…" 

01:58:05
MICHAEL YAPKO And perhaps in your thoughts and perceptions as well. I really won't know until you are describing those understandings to me. In a little while. But here is an experience that you allowed because you trusted yourself in this very new situation with me who you've never met before, you trusted yourself to deal with whatever I might say or do. You trusted yourself to deal with the spontaneity, the unexpected and that's an important thing. Because it doesn't have to be trust out in the world or predictability out in the world or even safety out in the world. There only has to be your internal awareness that you can deal with it. And someone wise once said, that the best way to predict the future is to create it. And with every interaction that you have with your family, the one that you've created, you have an opportunity to do things better. You have an opportunity to discover what's right about you.

02:01:30
SCOTT D. MILLER And you trust him? 

02:01:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. It's nice to have somebody like that around. 

02:01:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Right, right. 

02:01:35
UNKNOWN It's we had some bad times. Like (inaudible ) having problems and stuff like that, and that, that helped, the day when grandpa pass away, and then I lost my sister, like five deaths in family within a year. 

02:01:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Wow. And so just how long that, I'm sorry. 

02:01:55
UNKNOWN It was about five years ago now. We just four men at (inaudible ). Man and it was darn tough. And it was, you know, and then I started to talk with him and that, that helped. We are going. 

02:02:05
SCOTT D. MILLER It kept you going.

02:02:10
UNKNOWN Oh yeah. 

02:02:10
SCOTT D. MILLER You're not somebody that, I mean, obviously, you're outgoing, but it takes you, you like to build relationships slowly, you know, over time, am I getting this? okay all right. 

02:02:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, it takes me a lot to get to trust somebody enough to, to let him, you know go like in my business too, I got to trust the guy that's watching the banks for me. If I don't trust him, you know, I'm always as I was here as watching. If you don't watch me, I could be dead tomorrow, you know and that happens. 

02:02:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Right how do, I mean do you trust that bank person now? 

02:02:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, you know, I watch him good and I've got a couple of people to help me watch. So that one never will be covered up again. Once was enough. 

02:02:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Oh, you've already had this happen to you. 

02:02:50
UNKNOWN I've had it happen once and I never want it happen again. 

02:02:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. All right, so it's both. It's both that and I imagine maybe the same, that, that umm… you, you take a while to build this relationship but then there is also a part of sort of keeps an eye on yourself as well. 

02:03:05
UNKNOWN Right. Yeah. 

02:03:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Making sure that things are okay and that you're still safe and…

Emotions 

02:05:30
PAUL PELUSO Emotions. We've talked a lot about them already in linear and non-linear communications and empathy in building the therapeutic relationship. They are central to the human experience and to effective therapy but there is a problem. Most people including clinicians don't understand them or don't feel comfortable with them. They think of them as these monsters that will come out and ruin everything. Think of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or the incredible Hulk. Remember the line, don't get me angry, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry. In addition to be monsterly, emotions are also seen as feminine or weak especially for men. Don't believe me, fill in the blanks. Boys don't. I thought so. And for women they are taught that any display of anger or rage will get them labeled as hey, oh, right which was to keep this rated PG. They are taught that the only way that they can express anger is by crying and that's really not fair. Unfortunately, even in the therapy room, even here, we are not comfortable with emotions, even though, it can be argued that the pressed emotions Victorian over a 100 years ago gave rise to the talking cure. Today, many clinicians have been taught to value cognitions or behaviors and emotions have been relegated to the bawdy, Teague younger siblings of mental health. We taught generations of clinicians to be cognitive therapists or cognitive behavioral therapists and even though those approaches are fine, in fact they are very effective, clinicians haven't been very comfortable in dealing with emotions and if they are not comfortable with emotions, it sends a message to clients that it's not okay to express them in here. Now, over the last few years there have been a number of approaches that have begun to look at emotions again and see them as the engine to drive and feel the kind of change that clients need in therapy. And that's why we're gonna talk about some of that here. In order to help clinicians understand emotions better, we have broken down the emotional delivery system into three basic elements. They are, one, the outward expression of affect. Two, internal feeling experiences and three, emotional states. The first part, outward expressions of emotion is perhaps the easiest for clinicians to detect in the client. It's all the stuff that you see. Facial expressions, body posture, tone of voice. Sometimes it can be obvious or it can be more subtle. It requires using linear and non-linear methods like listening for feelings and listening for presents to detect them. Okay so let's talk about pushing people away. Now we've already established that you don't suffer fools gladly but what else is it about people that irritates you and makes you want to push them away? 

02:08:25
UNKNOWN I don't know. 

02:08:30
PAUL PELUSO Well, stop right there for a second. You, kind of shook your head no and frown. What, what were you feeling right there? What, what was going on? 

02:08:35
UNKNOWN I don't know, I'm, I'm confused. I uh…, I don't want to push them away. But you I, I don't care that the people of work don't like me but I mean, I guess, I had to do but I don't have to live with them. So I'm just not sure. 

02:08:50
PAUL PELUSO Okay, so on the one hand, you know, you're angry it gets you what you want, you get to avoid all the people you think are idiots. Uh… but on the other hand it could really cost you. It could cost you your job which you love and more importantly, it could cost you your fiancé. It can cost you the people you care about most in your life? 

02:09:10
Internal feeling experiences 

02:09:10
PAUL PELUSO Next are internal feeling states. These are not so obvious to the therapist and sometimes to the client but they are essentially are bodily sensations related to emotion. It is the nervous system activation when a powerful emotion is present and skilled clinicians know how to use them to make clients more aware of their feelings. Sometimes these can be expressed as sensations of warmth or cold or they can expressed as lightness or heaviness and they can be located in a particular part of the body. Again, getting the client to focus on these areas can help them understand the emotion and their situation more fully. Lastly there are the emotional states. There are much deeper level and closely tied to a person's schema dynamics. Many times clients are unaware of these emotions. Let's first talk about primary emotions. They are universal to all human beings. Paul Ekman was the researcher who went into remote tribes to discover that even the most far removed cultures displayed affect in the same way as some of the more western cultures. There are seven primary emotions. They are surprised, happy, sad, fear, anger, disgust and contempt. As you can see each one has a unique facial display. We recommend that you look into the work of Dr. Ekman and others to learn more about these displays. You'll have these expressions in the video section for you to look at as well. Now while primary emotions are universal, secondary emotions are culture specific. They include things like embarrassment, shame, envy and humor and what might be appropriate in one culture may not be appropriate in another. So how does this all fit with a person's schema dynamics. Well, take for example this lamp. We have the plug which might represent the schema dynamics that provides electricity and then you have the bulb which could be display of affect or some other type of behavior, aggression, affection, etc. In between is the wire and this represents the emotional delivery system. Now most people don't understand this connection and it's our job to explain it to them. The schema dynamics, the emotional delivery system and the final behavior. So now, let's take a look at some examples of clinicians working with client's emotional systems. Pay attention to how they work with the client's emotional delivery system and how they are tied to the schema dynamics.

02:12:10
"How was it that you… get angry ?" 

02:12:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So that's reasonable. How is it though that getting a schedule, you didn't like and not and umm… uh… and it not being when you agreed to. How is it that you then got angry about that? 

02:12:30
UNKNOWN There is a lot of little bit of history with the agency of not getting umm… of things not working out the way we are told they are going to be. So it isn't the first time, this has happened. 

02:12:45
MARSHA LINEHAN So now that you have had a history where you do things, you agree to things and then they give you things somehow different than what you agreed to. 

02:12:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

02:12:55
MARSHA LINEHAN So those thoughts come into your mind? 

02:12:55
UNKNOWN Oh yeah. 

02:12:55
MARSHA LINEHAN So yes, I love that. Oh, yeah. 

02:13:00
UNKNOWN Oh yeah. 

02:13:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay so, so in other words, you saw this, you didn't like it, you said, it's not what we agreed to and then did it come into your mind? Umm… they are always doing this to me or they've done this before. They are doing it again. 

02:13:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

02:13:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay.

Emotion 

02:13:15
"You get fearful and you want to help…" 

02:13:20
PAT LOVE That makes sense because when your heart is open, see if this fits. When your heart is open, you relax and when you relax, you can listen and you don't have to tell me what to do when you're relaxed. Is it? 

02:13:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:13:40
PAT LOVE And I can imagine. 

02:13:45
UNKNOWN Because I'm getting just. 

02:13:45
PAT LOVE yeah. 

02:13:45
UNKNOWN I feel bad for him. I, I get worried. I get fearful. 

02:13:50
PAT LOVE Yes, you get fearful and then you want to help. 

02:13:50
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:13:50
PAT LOVE You want to help and so you extend the help. And I can imagine if we had a more pleasurable morning and you got to relax and you went through the day with your heart open, you might feel calmer and more trusting. 

02:14:10
UNKNOWN True, absolutely. 

02:14:10

"What does she deeply want?" 

02:14:20
STEVE HAYES And what I want you to do is see if you can get in touch with the amount of pain that she's in and judgment that she's carrying. Wanting safety and not getting it. Getting criticism from mom and not even in the sense stepping up to honoring that violation that happened to her, acknowledging that her. 

02:14:50
[sil.] 

02:14:55
STEVE HAYES Is there something she wants from you that you can give her? You got in here. What does she wants deeply want? 

02:15:05
UNKNOWN To feel loved. 

02:15:10
STEVE HAYES Okay. Do you love her? 

02:15:15
UNKNOWN Maybe. I don't know. I mean, I'm annoyed of her. 

02:15:25
STEVE HAYES All right, she's turned back off your lamp. 

02:15:25
UNKNOWN Sorry. 

02:15:25
STEVE HAYES Now, go in there, don't answer this quick. Go inside this resistance. There is a place that you're sort of withholding, it's conditional yeah with her and I want you to open up that and see it if there is some possibilities of getting stuck right there. But go there, I mean, take a little time and then come on out. If you're gonna stand there, I want you to say that to her directly. I'm not…

"I blame myself because I think I can control my anger…" 

02:16:10
UNKNOWN We think, it's our fault that we, it just. 

02:16:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And so you're one of these women who blame yourself. 

02:16:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:16:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH How much do you really blame yourself? 

02:16:20
UNKNOWN I blame myself because I think, I can control my anger, my screaming. That I think I can be a little bit coward. But I mean, I've always within, you know, like I get really frustrated when constantly cleaning and cooking, cleaning and cooking and they come home, like they come over today… 

02:16:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You know anybody who is living in this amount of tension, is frustrated and when you're frustrated, you feel like exploding. So you're blaming yourself for exploding. Yes, it is, wiser for you to shrug it off but I don't know how much a normal human being can take and the answer is to walk out. 

02:16:55
UNKNOWN I asked him about his money. 

02:16:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Let me stop you. You went quickly away. 

02:17:00
UNKNOWN I'm sorry. 

02:17:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah, it's all right, I'm just, just this important uh… point here. You said, you've asked him why don't you just walk out. You know, which is what a mature man does before he hits somebody. But also umm… and it's understandable people get angry. They lose their temper. But what about you just removing yourself. 

02:17:20
UNKNOWN Kids. 

02:17:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You won't let you leave. 

02:17:25
UNKNOWN He backs the door, I tried. All the time. 

02:17:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH I see. So you try to get away? 

02:17:30
UNKNOWN Images. He thinks, I come and argue with him in the bathroom. 

02:17:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, so am I hearing that you're blaming yourself for exploding when you're trying to get away. He's blocking the door. He, he continues at you and we all have a limit. So you're blaming yourself. 

02:17:45
UNKNOWN Not for that, no. 

02:17:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH No, not for that. 

02:17:50
UNKNOWN Right yeah.

02:17:55
"I didn't know there was a different way to be…" 

02:17:55
SUE JOHNSON …You said, we are starting to realize, I'm starting to realize that underneath this pattern that we would get caught in where you know, you'd move away and shut down and say, I don't know what to say, so I'm not gonna say anything and you get more and more anxious, more and more upset. You said, I started to realize that really, it was like a baby crying, yeah. 

02:18:20
UNKNOWN Yes. Uh… and, and the reason that I use that analogy is because I just don't uh… I know for one that I didn't recognize what was going on uh… my family background is you know, we are not a very close family unit. Umm… you know, there was not a lot of love and tenderness shown around and, and being cast in the traditional male role, you know, I thought, oh, you got to be strong, you got to do everything on your own. You have to depend on yourself and, and you know, I, when in doubt, I always, I always just reached back into that, that mode to, to kind of set me through. 

02:19:05
SUE JOHNSON Be strong, be silent. 

02:19:05
UNKNOWN And that, that, in, in looking at the literature that, that was absolutely the worst thing that I could have done but I, I, I can almost honestly say that I, I didn't know that there was a different way to be. You're not coming from a loving touching uh…

02:19:25
Emotion 

02:19:25
"So you tried to regulate…" 

02:19:30
MARSHA LINEHAN That's what it sounds like. It sounds like in fact, anger might be getting reinforced in this situation. 

02:19:35
UNKNOWN Because I get her. 

02:19:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, that's my guess. Yes, reason, effective response in the sense that it gets you hurt. So let's look at this then. So, okay, so now, you're angry. How many minutes was it before you called your boss? 

02:19:55
UNKNOWN I think, it was about like I said about a half an hour of working myself up. 

02:20:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay so what happened this whole half hour? 

02:20:00
UNKNOWN I was trying to tell myself, okay, wait talk to her, know, yeah. 

02:20:05
MARSHA LINEHAN In other words, you tried to regulate. 

02:20:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:20:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, too divine, okay, that's really good. Okay, so in other words, your anger went up and then you actually tried to regulate. Oh, so that's what you're trying to see whether why it didn't work. So what did you try first? 

02:20:20
UNKNOWN Try just telling myself well the main concern was the no days off for several months. 

02:20:25
MARSHA LINEHAN All right. 

02:20:30
UNKNOWN So I tried to tell myself, what's only a couple of months, you can do this. This is the end, you know, you're at the end of the program, you're almost there. You can do this and try to. 

02:20:40
MARSHA LINEHAN So you tried to get yourself actually not to care. 

02:20:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:20:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so anger is often a response to having goals or what you want interfered with blocked. 

02:20:50
UNKNOWN Frustrated so… 

02:20:50
MARSHA LINEHAN This was, this would be thought of as justified chain and since it is, it's a usual enormative chain, I mean that chain, sorry anger. 

02:21:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:21:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. However, so what you try to do is get rid of it, the cue. You try to get rid of, you try to say, no it's really not blocking anything and I really can't handle this except so how, well, that's a pretty good strategy. Why didn't it work?

02:21:15
"If she did that you would feel loved, and supported and encouraged by her…" 

02:21:20
PAT LOVE And because you say when in the morning, I'm gonna do mirror validation empathy. In the morning, if I would listen and let you just talk about your thoughts, one the burden would lift and I can imagine if I did that regularly, you might feel loved, appreciated and maybe even like you said motivated to go to the next step. Is that, is that accurate? Okay. 

02:21:50
UNKNOWN Certainly when I'm told, when I'm given a solution that I don't agree with. It goes back a step or I stay right where I am. 

02:22:00
PAT LOVE Yeah, so instead of solution, what you'd like is listening. 

02:22:05
UNKNOWN Correct. 

02:22:05
PAT LOVE Yes and when you listen, it, it sounds like don't let me put words in your mouth again but if you would listen and even I don't know about the mirroring but just listen and maybe, you know, mirror some like you've been, you're very good at that by the way. So when you mirror, you know and, and you validate and say this makes sense because it does lift the burden, it does take it off your chest and that I think what you're implying is it clears your mind to go on to your own solution and if she did that, you would feel loved and supported and encouraged by her. Is that accurate? 

02:22:50
UNKNOWN Yes, yes, I think that's accurate because, I, I often don't take her…

02:23:00
Emotion 

02:23:00
"If don't feed the anxiety, it will dissipate…" 

02:23:00
PAT LOVE Saying is if you just tune in, now this is the fourth suggestion, you know. This might help you and my hunch is if you did it with mirroring where you really had to focus and tune in that would but you're not gonna be anxious while you're doing, if you're truly, if you're truly attuned, you're not gonna be anxious because you're not feeding the anxiety. 

02:23:25
UNKNOWN No matter what he's saying. 

02:23:25
PAT LOVE No, no, well, he's gonna be talking. What you're gonna do is simply, your job is to mirror, validate, empathize. Mirror, validate, empathize and I promise you if you do this long enough, your anxiety will go away. Because if you don't feed the anxiety, it will dissipate and so you hear him say, he gets up and you hear him what it sounds like, you know, downloading all this information, you know, that's coming during the night and he's downloading it and you, you feel like, oh, I have to fix it and if you go there, that's gonna lower your anxiety. First of all, he's not gonna take it. You know, and then it's gonna cause conflict. 

02:24:05
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:24:10
PAT LOVE But your job is to simply, if he chose to do this. 

02:24:10
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:24:10
PAT LOVE Mirror, mirror, mirror, validate, empathize. If you did this, just a few short times your brain would catch on because you're good at it. You're sort of a natural. Your brain would catch on. What, what all I need to do when he, when you hear because you're probably know what the tone of voice. Do you know…

"What would you not have to care about to not get hurt?…" 

02:24:40
STEVE HAYES Reach out and touch folks. Take some time to sort of go in there and get in touch with that pain. If we were to, to give it a, a word, give, give me a couple of words just to the core of it. Take a little moment to actually, see if you can sort of find it. 

02:25:05
UNKNOWN Well…

02:25:30
UNKNOWN It's pain. 

02:25:30
STEVE HAYES Okay. And what I want you to do sort of, is pick that pain and sort of flip it over and tell me what do you care about such that, that would be so painful? Like what would you have to not care about for that not to hurt? 

02:25:50

MARSHA LINEHAN Most of the time but nonetheless right at the moment, your current level of skills, it seems like what we have to insert is the thought in your mind that says, I won't like mine. 

02:26:15
UNKNOWN If I wasn't that way with people. 

02:26:15
MARSHA LINEHAN All right. So your self-respect is on the line. 

02:26:20
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:26:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So then we have to switch what you're gonna say to yourself. Okay, because telling yourself that you'll be more effective if your skills are not, actually not be true with some people. At least not at your current level of skills. I do have to tell you that I think, you can get skilled enough where skill will work better than anger most of the time but nonetheless right at the moment, at your current level of skills, it seems like what we have to insert is the thought in your mind that says, I won't like myself if I do this. Because that's, that's the real reason you want to change, right?

02:27:30
UNKNOWN Uh… that was just the analogy that I use. I, I think you know in looking at, at literature and listening to the tapes, you know, it was probably a fear of failure, you know and… 

02:27:40
SUE JOHNSON Is all right? Fearful, that's. 

02:27:45
UNKNOWN Not being good enough for the… Particular relationship or… 

02:27:50
SUE JOHNSON That's a huge one, isn't it? 

02:27:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

02:27:55

02:28:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

02:28:05
SUE JOHNSON And feel like, I don't know how to do it and I'm never gonna make it, I'm never gonna be good enough for him or her. That hurts.

02:28:25
JON CARLSON I don't know if that works for you guys. See, one of the things that I find happens, it sounds like it's going out with you guys is that, you get into this situations and very quickly they escalate and I learnt that once your heart rate is above 96 beats a minute, you know, what happens? all bets are off. Yeah, it's for you, it's fight or flight and, and for you it's getting defensive. You know, it, it just put up her arm and it's, all over, so somehow we've got in the way, to each of you guys to soothe things a little bit, to keep things down a little bit. And if we had agreed upon a strategy to use that might really be helpful. And we know this one to get the…

MARSHA LINEHAN You're in a lot of trouble if that's true. You're in a world of trouble if only anger works in your agency. 

02:29:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:29:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay but then if only and a lot of people are in that situation with only it works this angry behavior. But the trick to angry behavior then is to do it skillfully. And there was to be in control of the angry behavior. Acting angry in other words can be useful but it's usually a lot more useful if you're not angry than you act angry. You can be more strategic.

02:30:15

02:30:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, I mean, yeah it does I mean it. Yeah. It tells me how much I want to be close to somebody. 

02:30:35
STEVE HAYES Okay. 

02:30:35
UNKNOWN And how much I want my relationship to work. 

02:30:40
STEVE HAYES Okay. Now if you, if you have that but it's kind of out there in the future and if you pull into the present, so it isn't just that, I want to have a good relationship but it's something more like, I want to step towards that kind of connection that I know something about and that hurts when it was not there. Like what are you gonna have to carry? I asked you, if we have that pain on one side or it was in the other side, okay. Suppose, these are two flip sides of the same thing. Suppose that sweet spot and the pain of loneliness, judgment, lack of safety, lack of creating a place, of the adults creating a place where you can play. What if that sweet spot and that pain are two sides of the same coin? And I suppose, I give it to you and I say here is this thing and you couldn't get rid of it. You can hide from loneliness and the pain and suffering that you're gonna have to throw away both sides. I'm sorry, you got to throw away. The sweet spot too. You can't care about that. 

02:31:50
UNKNOWN Oh, because it's possible. 

02:31:55
STEVE HAYES Oh, well you kind of annoyed been doing it, you know. You've been trying to throw it away and then get mad if this other side gets thrown too. 

02:32:00
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:32:05
STEVE HAYES You know, what I'm saying. Okay, so here it is. We got a piece of paper here, this little thing. We got two sides of it. We got this vulnerable little girl that got her loneliness, hurt and pain, yeah and then we've got this part…

You didn't understand that, there is also and help me, you can correct me if I'm wrong here, okay. Umm… there was also sort of a desperation. She was pushing because she wanted you to come and you didn't understand that. You just saw her telling you, you're doing this wrong buddy. Am I, am I getting it? 

02:32:50
UNKNOWN Exactly, yeah. 

02:32:50
SUE JOHNSON Right and then when you heard the message, I'm doing it wrong, you just didn't know what to do. So you just sort of withdraw, right. 

02:33:00

Focused Breathing 

02:33:20
MICHAEL YAPKO The idea of focusing to you. All right. If umm…, you're comfortable the way that you're sitting, that's fine. What I suggest is that you do with your eyes closed, taking a few deep breaths and just want yourself for a couple of minutes to the notion of absorbing yourself and the different way of thinking about your own experience. And you probably haven't thought about it this way before. But when you get absorbed in the, the past, the negative feelings of things that have gone on. You can get so absorbed in it that you really don't see other ways of thinking, other ways of feeling. But one of the things that's potentially valuable about taking a few minutes to just sit quietly, the way you are now is that it gives you the freedom to explore other parts of yourself. I know you're much, much more than your past might and that phrase of being much more than your past is going to surface at different times, in different places. 

02:34:40
[sil.] 

02:34:45
MICHAEL YAPKO But when I encourage you to start thinking a little differently about yourself and your experience and to go exploring within yourself, there is strength that you have that you will use to cope, that you use to build a different life for yourself. Being married, having your own family. Things that you have clearly left behind.

02:35:45
SUE JOHNSON All right.

UNKNOWN That he had felt that he wasn't good enough because I felt like I've never didn't, that's not what I ever meant to convey, you know, I've just wanted him. I mean, he's obviously good enough.

02:38:30
SUE JOHNSON When you were attacking each other, yeah. 

02:38:30
UNKNOWN And uh… I think that's in, in reflecting back on it, I think, I was trying to push her away as quickly as I could, you know, we just, you know, to bring peace to the… 

02:38:45
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

02:38:50
UNKNOWN The situation of the moment which, you know, obviously did no good at all. 

02:38:55
SUE JOHNSON So you're saying to your lady, you help me when she says this to you, you feel what? You feel sad or you feel, what she's saying this or you, you feel regret, you say to yourself, I gee, I maybe she's got the right to be scared because I acted badly, is that how it goes? 

02:39:15
UNKNOWN Well, yes, I, I think she's got the right to feel that way because I did act badly and, and I do from time to time and, and you know, I think we both do. You know, it's, it's distressing to me to think that it could be over, you know, that, that she's reached the point where she can't take it anymore. You can't take it anymore, you know and that's certainly not what I want. 

02:39:40

SUE JOHNSON Right. But right here, but it sounds like, you guys are helping each other heal, walking to a whole new place where you can take those kinds of risks for each other, right. But right here, right now, it's, it's pretty scary. I'm hearing it's pretty scary for you to talk about the softer feelings and to say to your partner, listen all these years, really I've been trying to reach for you. You may be, I've been doing it a way that, in a way that was pushing you away but I've been trying to reach for you. That's pretty scary for you to do, right. Because some part of your brain says, don't go there, don't go there. That's weak, that's a dangerous place, right so that's scary for you, yeah.

02:40:40
JUDY BECK The solution is basically we focus on our breathing and there is all different kinds. You know, that you can find. But it might be with uh… you're talking to somebody or getting some kind of a meditation take for something to work on. 

02:40:55
UNKNOWN Well, I've gotten this new diestrum different medication and I started with a therapist because I went from doctor to doctor and he says, I've got some underlying deep seeded anger problems and I try to do, I started going to a group of ragoholics and there is another problem I had was OCD and I had a umm… a situation where somebody approached me that, that was a little less than desirable. And it made my skin crawl and I quit. I was trying, I was trying to get everything under control. 

02:41:50
JUDY BECK So that was something that worked until this event happened and you were making some progress at it. You may have these underlying issues and, and I think it's you know, I think it's probably a good thing that you see a therapist and maybe talk those too but you're also after you get those issues out, you still got to learn some new ways to be. And you know, that's why I think, if you could start umm… some kind of an exercise program, maybe even taking sometime to meditate daily, I think that's gonna reduce this significantly for you, so that you're gonna have more of the pause before you respond. So I think what happens is you just, something that happens and there is like a major reaction for him and he's condition himself so that he can uh… stop when he wants to stop and then not respond. You know, you might even benefit from it too because uh… it sounds like you've got a lot of the things and grievance that couples have when relationships go south. There are things like uh… criticism which you know, it sounds like that's like what's called contempt. You look at somebody in a negative way. It sounds like that's there and you're each defending, you're defensive, you defend your right to do what you're doing even though, you know, you defend your attitude and you defend your anger and then there is a stonewall, you put up sometimes, where you just want to talk, you, you remove yourself from one another and those are the four things that really make your relationship go bad and if you can learn how to pause, you can have some choices a little bit. so you can choose rather than defending, maybe you can take a deep breath and you can say, so if I understand you right, you think we need to have the kids leave us alone, so we can talk. You will say, that's exactly right and you will say, I agree with you, how she handle it. I think there are some real co-operation that you guys show at times. When you keep your heart rates down a little bit. 

02:44:10
UNKNOWN It might go so fast, it go up though. 

02:44:10
JUDY BECK Well, that's why I think you need some of the other training. You know. I don't think, it's just gonna happen by talking. I think, you're really gonna have to do some work. You're gonna have to do some training. Now, one thing I wonder, what do you guys do for fun? I couldn't…

Ambivalence 

02:45:10
[sil.] 

02:45:15
PAUL PELUSO Rats. No, I mean rats. Now, some of you might be wondering what I'm doing with rats and you might be wanting to turn this off but don't do that just yet. These little guys have something to teach us about ambivalence. You see back in the 1950s, there were these two guys. Dullard and Miller and they wanted to see what they would have to do when they were confronted with a choice. Now, these might be two good options, they might be two bad options or maybe a combination of a good option and a bad option. The point is that each kind put them into a dilemma, put them into a bind if you will. They have to make a choice when they didn't want to. We can or don't want to choose all kinds of interesting behavior happens. Back to the rats. Dullard and Miller will put them in a pretty boring maze, just a long quarter going from end to end. Now, on either side, they might put two good options or two pieces of cheese and the rat have to decide which one they want to go to or they might attach two food chokers to either end. And then sorry. The rat have to decide which one they had to avoid. Or they might put food and food and food chokers on one end. The rat would then be attracted and repulse that both at the same time. The last one is when they put and food and chalk on both ends and then they'd be caught in the middle between deciding which one to go and which one to avoid. So what do rats and humans do when faced with these dilemmas, well the reality is that their experience of ambivalence, well, I can always speak to the human's experience, I'm not quite sure of rat's experiences is that they feel pulled in both directions at the same time or they also feel caught between a rock and a hard place. And lastly, they want to have their cake and eat it too. And in terms of how they respond, well they do one of four different types of behaviors. They either vacillate endlessly going back and forth. They let fate decide. It's like tossing a coin and seeing what comes up. They become paralyzed or they try to escape. So how the anxious person might come and endlessly going back and forth between choosing their relationship or not. A depressed patient might feel like their job or co-workers are toxic. But feel that they are unable to leave it. So they become paralyzed. And they don't perform as well as they could. They might start to calling sick because they are depressed and they can't get out of bed. Ultimately, when the company downsizes, they are laid off and that's what fate has decided for them. The person gets to say it's not their fault, but are they really any better off? Okay, so let me sum this up. You are very, very good at what you do. You take on a lot for everybody. Both at home and at work but it's all motivated out of this deep fear of not being replaced kind of like you were as a girl growing up. And the problem is that you've had to sort of pay a price for that and that, you know, you thought it might help you feel connected and then you kind of feeling more lonely. You feel more umm…, you feel more isolated than you have before. 

02:48:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:48:30
PAUL PELUSO So you can agree with me that maybe getting you to be able to reach out to people and ask them for help. That would be a goal to work towards. 

02:48:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:48:40
PAUL PELUSO Okay, I heard some hesitation in your voice there. 

02:48:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:48:45
PAUL PELUSO Okay. How about it would be a good goal to work towards umm… helping you, helping with your fear of being replaced and helping you to not feel so lonely. 

02:48:55
UNKNOWN I agree with that. 

02:49:00
PAUL PELUSO All These ambivalence behavior are usually unproductive, unsatisfying and could even be problematic or dangerous in our client's lives. However and here is the non-linear part, that all serve an important purpose. All behaviors, vacillating endlessly, letting fate decide, becoming paralyzed or trying to escape. They help the client to not have to make a decision. Now, our job is to help them resolve this ambivalence so that way they can move forward and make a better choice in their lives. It's kind of like our job is helping them to get their cheese and eat it too. Right fluffy. 

02:49:40
UNKNOWN I just don't know what to do. I think, I should Mary Fred but I love John. 

02:49:40
UNKNOWN You should Mary Fred. 

02:49:45
UNKNOWN But I want John. 

02:49:45
UNKNOWN Marry Fred. 

02:49:45
UNKNOWN But… 

02:49:45
UNKNOWN Get off the fence. You want to be alone all your life. You've been here for five years saying, you want a man, I say Mary Fred. 

02:49:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, that's not good therapy. While it may be great for TV or movies, it is actually toxic to the therapeutic relationship. Now, I know what you're saying, are there sometimes when you have to be direct, when you have to confront the client? The answer is of course you do and sometimes you have to be direct. But more often than not, you want the client to wrestle with both sides of the ambivalence while preserving the therapeutic relationship. This is the essence of the motivational interviewing approach by Miller and Rollnick. Two of their techniques are rolling with the resistance and developing discrepancies. But non-linear philosophy behind it is take what you like and leave the rest. The key is not to actively take a side but to reflect the dilemma back to the client. 

02:50:40
UNKNOWN It sounds like you've quite a dilemma. You're unsure about marrying Fred. 

02:50:45
UNKNOWN I didn't say, I don't love him. I could be happy with him and live a life with him. 

02:50:45
UNKNOWN But on the other hand, you have these feelings for John. 

02:50:50
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:50:50
UNKNOWN Which have come on suddenly. So maybe they are real but maybe they are not. 

02:50:55
UNKNOWN What makes you think they are not real? 

02:51:00
UNKNOWN Well, unless, I'm wrong, they seem to have come on at a critical moment as you're having to make a choice about committing to Fred. And I know that marriage isn't a commitment that you take lightly. So it would be a good thing to think it through. 

02:51:10
UNKNOWN I just don't know what to do. 

02:51:15
UNKNOWN It's, well, it's a decision that only you can make. It seems to be a decision between fear, making a lifelong commitment to one person and fear of making a mistake. 

02:51:25
UNKNOWN I'm just so confused, I don't know what to do. 

02:51:30
UNKNOWN Well, not making a decision is making a choice. It's got to be up to you to decide what is best. It all really depends on what you want for your life and what you're willing to live with. 

02:51:40
PAUL PELUSO Now that was a good example of rolling with the resistance and developing discrepancies. Did you notice how the clinician kept bringing the client back to the central dilemma even when she tried to get away from it. The therapist now argue with the client when she begin to disagree and gently brought her back to the central issue or dilemma all without taking a side. It's the client's job to wrestle with the problem and resolve the ambivalence and it's the therapist's job to help guide them through it all without taking a side. 

02:52:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, I will be good. 

02:52:15
PAUL PELUSO Yeah. You know, I just noticed, your whole body posture just sort of deflated like somebody, you know, took the air out of you. 

02:52:25
UNKNOWN It's just, I should need this. I, I'm not weak. 

02:52:30
PAUL PELUSO And you're afraid of looking weak? 

02:52:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, well, I don't, I wouldn't want to disappoint my dad and I just feel like if I'm weak then you know, he'll be disappointed at me. 

02:52:40
PAUL PELUSO Okay, so if you are weak you'd feel like you'd be disappointing dad but if you don't find a way to cope with these feelings and deal with them more appropriately, you could lose your job, you can lose your fiancé and how do you think your dad would feel about that? 

02:52:55
UNKNOWN Well, disappointed but I don't want to be weak. I don't want to lose. 

02:53:00
PAUL PELUSO Okay. You don't want to be weak, don't want to lose, what if I told you there is a way to be strong and win? 

02:53:05
UNKNOWN I'd be interested in that. 

02:53:10
PAUL PELUSO So now let's take a look at some examples of ambivalence. See to if you can classify the four types of ambivalence behaviors, vacillating endlessly, letting fate decide, becoming paralyzed or trying to escape and see if you can pick up how the clinicians try to help the client resolve their ambivalence. 

02:53:30
Marsha Linehan, Ph.D. 

02:53:30
Ambivalence 

02:53:30
"How do I impose a consequence on myself…" 

02:53:35
[sil.] 

02:53:40
MARSHA LINEHAN So what you need to do is if you're going to have, the only, only person who can give consequence right at the moment is gonna be you and discipline is not the way to do it. That's the way of saying, I'll try harder which if that was kind of work, it would have worked by now, I guarantee you. Okay, because I'm sure, you've already done the I'll try harder part. 

02:53:55
UNKNOWN How do I impose a consequence on myself? 

02:54:00
MARSHA LINEHAN You do pros and cons. You remind yourself in the time of what the consequences are that I'm gonna feel bad about myself if I do this. 

02:54:05
UNKNOWN That morning. Okay. 

02:54:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. When you get up you remind yourself instead of saying, I have to do this, I have to do this, you say, okay my choice is I can either do it or not do it and if I don't do it here is how I'm gonna feel later. Is it really worth it to redo more pages on my magazine? You know do I, is two pages worth right, what's coming my way in the future? So part of what you have to do is bring your future into your present. Is five more minutes in bed worth feeling bad later on for become late with my client? And do in effect in your mind, the pros and cons. 

02:54:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:54:40
MARSHA LINEHAN And so practice the pros and cons in that to get yourself out and practice the pros and cons when you're getting ready to go exercise. If you were me and I were you, I would just make a rule of no exercise. But you're probably right, I think, you'll find a new magazine to read. 

02:54:55
UNKNOWN Yeah puts up…

Judy Beck, Ph.D. 

02:55:00
Ambivalence 

02:55:00
Double Approach-Avoidance 

02:55:05
JUDY BECK And what do you think having pictures on the wall and nice furniture and kids on the bed, why does that make you feel better? What does it make you realize? 

02:55:20
UNKNOWN Umm… it just make me realize that the house is full. I mean, I grew up with a full house. Furniture you know family and everybody was always there and I think just being in the room by myself growing up with eight other older brothers and sisters, it, it's just scary. 

02:55:35
JUDY BECK No wonder, you feel scared when you see that kind of image. So now every time you have that kind of image, see if you can see yourself now wait a minute. I'm gonna improve on it. 

02:55:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:55:45
JUDY BECK And then add things to the image. 

02:55:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:55:50
JUDY BECK But maybe we had to talk now about this, the, the thought that you have words which I might not make it. Especially with mom's not around, I might not make it. 

02:56:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:56:00
JUDY BECK Now, there is no doubt about it. So if your mother had died at some point in the next few years, that you would probably really feel at a loss. You'd be very grief stricken at first. You have several losses already and so this would be another one on top of it. She sounds very important to you. But I wonder if you could see that umm… although, you would be extraordinarily pained at first but you'd be able to continue on with life and that, that grief might get a little bit less as time went on. Do you think that's possible? 

02:56:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:56:35
JUDY BECK Is there something that makes you think that you might go downhill and stale downhill? 

02:56:40
UNKNOWN I don't know. 

02:56:40
JUDY BECK You're like, you need your mom in order to make good decisions or… 

02:56:45
UNKNOWN I feel like I need to gain independence from it happened in order to… You know, I, I want to be, I want to be independent before anything happens to her. I don't want to it to force me to. I don't want, if anything happen to her to force me into having to be responsible and having to be, you know, I don't want to, I just don't want that to happen. 

02:57:10
JUDY BECK I think, it's a good plan. Again, do you know what to do? What to do first in order to get more independent or the things that you've already done to try to get more independent? 

02:57:20
UNKNOWN I'm, I'm trying to getting more independent but it's like, the hard part to me is having everybody telling me well, you should do this first. You should do this first and that to me is another burden in part. Everybody tell me well, you should do this and do this and you should do this, this way and it's like I'm trying to figure out on my own, I don't have a clue now. 

02:57:40
JUDY BECK Yeah. 

02:57:40
UNKNOWN I felt this like. I put…

Marsha Linehan, Ph.D.

Ambivalence 

02:57:45
"Why not give up on this… I mean, why bother?" 

02:57:50
[sil.] 

02:57:55
UNKNOWN That's a good one because that would be a consequence that I wouldn't like. That's interesting. 

02:58:00
MARSHA LINEHAN You like that thinking? Here is my point. You, you, the only way to get yourself to do somebody that you don't want to do for a long range consequence is to put a short range consequence then? 

02:58:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:58:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Because your problem is you, your consequence for this is long term, it's a week and you, you don't get a consequence talking to your friend and you're not gonna be able to get a friend who starts getting irritated with you, if she's not here now. 

02:58:20
UNKNOWN That's right. 

02:58:25
MARSHA LINEHAN You know. You may destroy the friendship by not getting anything written and making her have to do all the writing just to remind you, this little detail. 

02:58:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:58:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay and you could write that out in your mind yourself. 

02:58:35
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:58:35
MARSHA LINEHAN That it does help for long term friendships not to do your part. 

02:58:40
UNKNOWN That's right. 

02:58:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Do you think of those thoughts by the way? 

02:58:45
UNKNOWN Yes, I do, yes I do. 

02:58:45
MARSHA LINEHAN And they don't help. 

02:58:45
UNKNOWN You know, I've been slightly aided by the fact that she also runs into, you know things so I guess, I think we uh… saw each other. I'm glad you said that. 

02:59:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. All right. So here is the deal. If she doesn't right, what's the incentive actually for you to do it, if she's not doing it? I mean, seriously why not just say, when she's writing, I'll start writing? Because my guess is if she were writing something, tell me, if it's true. She was writing something every week and telling you what she'd written. Do you think that, that would mobilize you to start getting stuff written. 

02:59:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, probably would, probably would because then I'd feel guilty. I don't like to be the one uh… underperforming. 

02:59:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Right. Okay. So, so why don't we just give up on this? 

02:59:35
UNKNOWN Oh, no. 

02:59:35
MARSHA LINEHAN I mean, seriously. I mean, seriously, why not just give up on it until she starts writing. I mean why bother. 

02:59:45
UNKNOWN Huh.

UNKNOWN She's got, he's got another complex. Quite frank, he's friend with all of us. The room is a wreck, I straight up to bed. He's planning it all together, I'll put on the same box. He's all gonna put back together. And she wants to go, she want to take the legos off them too, it connects put down the rig. There is no need. He's gonna mess that up again. Putting away. 

03:00:20
JON CARLSON With that interest. 

03:00:25
UNKNOWN You know but it's her, she gets irritated that she has to do this all the time. Now why, why is your bedroom always gonna be uh… such a mess. What you know, you're not gonna put that dirt, you're not gonna… 

03:00:35
JON CARLSON How does that become your problem? 

03:00:40
UNKNOWN We don't have uh… 

03:00:45
JON CARLSON Don't have enough time. 

03:00:50
UNKNOWN We don't have time because she's, she's always gonna be cleaning up. You know, I don't, she will admit to you, I don't have a problem helping her. 

03:00:55
JON CARLSON And I have a hunch, so this is, put that in advance right now and there you're making a good suggestion. But my guess is that maybe sometimes people do things when relationships are going bad so they can avoid one another. So as long as he's picking things up, then I don't have to be with one another. Just, just hold that as a possibility and as you guys start to do some of these other more positive things. Let's just see if that doesn't take care of itself. That's a hunch just a hunch I have.

LEIGH MCCULLOUGH I guess what I was thinking is umm… again you keep saying, if I could just not provoke him. 

03:01:40
UNKNOWN It's just until I get enough saved up so leave him. You know, for us to have another setting that, we don't belong together and I just wish he would understand that we don't belong together because we really don't. 

03:01:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Why is that you, you need him to understand? Because I do think he will understand. 

03:01:55
UNKNOWN Because I want it to be a mutual divorce and I don't want to fight over and I just. 

03:02:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH I see. Is that a magical thinking, you've got a man who, you know, is gonna, is punching you in the face. 

03:02:10
UNKNOWN Wishful thinking. 

03:02:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Is a magical thinking that there is gonna be some uh… uh… reasonable divorce here. You're, you're wishing for something that's clearly not gonna happen.

03:02:35
JUDY BECK I'm sorry, can you say that again? 

03:02:35
UNKNOWN I feel confident in the decision, me wanting to move and share everybody with my mother and my sisters and everybody and being is like that's when all the pain is coming in. 

03:02:45
JUDY BECK I see, right and some people agree with you and some people don't agree with you. 

03:02:50
UNKNOWN Right, they agree that I should move, they agree and think that I should get a car first and I don't think it is important even though they do, they think that I need to have a way to get around but I think that, I only need somewhere to be… 

03:03:05
JUDY BECK To be. Yeah, well, it's really sound sensible to me. Sometimes when you have to make a decision, it's helpful to look at what are the advantages of say umm… moving first and what would be the disadvantages of moving first? 

03:03:20
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:03:20
JUDY BECK And then you can also look at what are the umm… advantages of getting a car first and disadvantages of getting a car first and I think if you do that, you are probably right about moving first since you seem to feel it pretty strongly in your gut. But I think if you put it down on paper, it may then help you answer your family members who are saying, no you should do something different. 

03:03:45
UNKNOWN Okay. Okay. 

03:03:50
JUDY BECK Does that sound sensible to you? 

03:03:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, it does. 

03:03:50
JUDY BECK What would be some of the advantages of moving first? 

03:03:55
UNKNOWN I have more time to start. 

03:03:55
JUDY BECK Yeah, you really going to be right some of these down so you can remember them. 

03:04:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:04:00
JUDY BECK Here you go. So you just put a line down on the middle of the page and put advantages. 

03:04:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:04:05
JUDY BECK On one side and disadvantages on the other side and we'll just this a little bit and do some other things with you. Maybe you can finish this. 

03:04:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:04:15
JUDY BECK uh… with on your own or… 

03:04:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:04:15
JUDY BECK With your sister or with your mom. 

03:04:20
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:04:20
JUDY BECK Okay, so this is umm… this is advantages and disadvantages of moving first. 

03:04:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:04:25
JUDY BECK Right. 

03:04:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:04:30
JUDY BECK And you said one advantage would be, you'd have more time to study. 

03:04:35
UNKNOWN I will have a lot more time to study. 

03:04:40
JUDY BECK Yeah. And have another advantage. 

03:04:45
UNKNOWN Umm… I'll be the only person, I would be the only adult that has the first and foremost say to my children. 

03:04:55
JUDY BECK Absolutely. So I think you better put that down. 

03:04:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:05:00
[sil.] 

03:05:05
JUDY BECK You know, my sense is you're doing it so well that you can probably continue to do this without me. 

03:05:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:05:10
JUDY BECK Do you think so or would you rather continue? 

03:05:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, I, I think that uh… just talking about it is getting me to thinking, I don't this far. 

03:05:20
JUDY BECK I'm, I'm really impressed I have to tell you by the fact that your depression score is 41 but you seem to be very clear thinking about this. So somehow you're able to overcome the depression to do this. 

03:05:35
UNKNOWN I think that, that's what I really want to do. 

03:05:35
JUDY BECK That's the way it sounds to me too. 

03:05:35
UNKNOWN I think that as, as like I'm just till to the point where I feel like I have to…

MATTHEW SELEKMAN Miracle question. Let's say tonight, you go home and while you're sound asleep, a miracle happens and this problem is completely solved, it's no longer an issue, this anger, this bitterness and out of control stuff. Umm… and, and things have changed the way you want them to be. What would be in each of your miracle pictures, the next thing when you wake up? 

03:06:20
UNKNOWN I don't know. I wouldn't, I don't know, it will be weird because it wouldn't be the same as I was, so. I wouldn't know what I would want because I can't react to well, yeah the piece it just don't work right… 

03:06:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, what else might be there that will help you feel better about things at home? 

03:06:40
UNKNOWN A lock on my door that works. 

03:06:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Has that been a problem that you haven't been able to sort of keep people out? 

03:06:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. That I can't lock my door. 

03:06:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

03:06:50
UNKNOWN And the kids, they don't really care. 

03:06:50
UNKNOWN I can't let her lock her door. 

03:06:55
UNKNOWN So I'm not trusted. 

03:06:55
UNKNOWN That's not acceptable. 

03:06:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN I got a question about that. Once you have that lock on the door, what difference would it make for you in terms of how you get along with other people? 

03:07:05
UNKNOWN I don't have to come out. 

03:07:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So you can have your priorities there. Okay who would you be the most surprised with a change with your mom when you wake up the next day after a miracle happens. What would you see her doing differently that will? 

03:07:15
UNKNOWN Not much. She's always up at like the crack of dawn, doing everything, make everyone happy so I don't know because…

03:07:45
UNKNOWN I was just gonna ask you, ask you a question. 

03:07:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

03:07:50
UNKNOWN Umm… I remember what we're, I think maybe terrible when I… 

03:07:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

03:07:50
UNKNOWN And you told me not to use that. 

03:07:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Because it was judgmental of yourself. This is terrible, I'm terrible. 

03:08:00
UNKNOWN And how is it counterproductive for me to be judgmental in my thought? 

03:08:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Because then you're, you're umm… you, once we start judging ourselves, we start avoiding ourselves. 

03:08:10
UNKNOWN Oh, that's good. 

03:08:10
MARSHA LINEHAN So, so I always try to tell people just drop the judgments, start over. So you have to practice the same things without the judgment.

03:08:45
UNKNOWN The times, I focus on bad things, it is, I guess my escape from it, you know, it's, I just feel it build up, you know and umm… a lot of times at work or something I just have to get out of there real quick, you know, and I just seem to cry for a long time, you know and umm… that's, that's probably how I just try to vent it out, you know.

UNKNOWN You know and uh… I know that a lot of times, you know when people say things that I guess it just, it seems to just, you know like a magnet or something you know, stick on you, you know and, and it's hard to get away from it but a lot of times I just try to tell myself like no, Mike, you know that's, that's not true, you know and so it's hard, you know, I mean it's, it's not easy to just say uh… forget it, you know, it's not right, you know. So…

MICHAEL YAPKO No, it isn't easy but it's.

Scaling Question 

03:10:20
UNKNOWN You are. 

03:10:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Let me, let me ask you guys a question. Umm… just to get a sense of where we've been and where we are at today. On a scale of one to ten, ten being, you know no blow ups umm… better controlling anger and one, a total pits, you know, total out of control stuff. What were things, you know like a month ago would you say? 

03:10:45
UNKNOWN I don't know. I always have… 

03:10:50
UNKNOWN I'm just, you know, it seems like a roller coaster to me, is what it seems like. If you, if you told me to try to pinpoint or, or it seems like a roller coaster to me. One day… 

03:11:00
UNKNOWN It depends which kid you're talking about like with Kathleen, if mom's gone for more than an hour and like month and she's a total disaster. 

03:11:05
UNKNOWN An emotional wreck. 

03:11:05
UNKNOWN Because she's like attached to her by the hip or something. It's ridiculous. He was sky-lift if my mom's gone and she's happy because she's with her dad and there is no one to discipline her then. 

03:11:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. Just play around with just an estimate. Where, where would you have seen things, let's say in the past a month or two on a scale of ten is the best, one is the pits? 

03:11:30
UNKNOWN Let's see, about umm… four. 

03:11:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN About a four? Okay. How about now? 

03:11:40
UNKNOWN Maybe a five but that's only because my husband is out of work and because he's acting differently because he's, he's not under the stress of work. 

03:11:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

03:11:50
UNKNOWN And he wants to sleep in the same room. 

03:11:55
UNKNOWN That's what I'm saying. 

03:11:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Sleeping in the same room with you? 

03:12:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. It's bad enough that he's laid off from work. 

03:12:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

03:12:00
UNKNOWN You know what I mean. 

03:12:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Sure. 

03:12:05
UNKNOWN So uh… he's just, he's been doing, he's been trying real harder. 

03:12:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. And you think that's been really helpful for Tiffany? 

03:12:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

03:12:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

03:12:10
UNKNOWN Right. 

03:12:10
UNKNOWN Because he's like a dad now before he was just like a prison guard, someone well boy, I get to go home, and get you all that. 

03:12:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Have you, have you known him, know that he's become more of a dad? 

03:12:25

03:13:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah.

03:13:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, it's you know, it's, I know if anyone can tell you that. But there is a reason and here the guy, his kids have grown up and that depend, does he make a fairly good living? 

03:13:45
UNKNOWN Well, see that's what bothers me. I don't know because it's like umm… he's from the south and up in the Midwest we are very fast paced and we are hopeful and I think he makes an okay living but he doesn't really, his work hours are totally different than, than mine or my family and I worry about that. 

03:14:05
WILLIAM GLASSER That's a difference. Yeah. It's kind of like live today, tomorrow will take care of itself kind of a thing? 

03:14:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, like oh, it's only money, you know, and I don't know up here it's, you know, you have to hustle and down there, I don't know if it's, they just, you know. 

03:14:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, I don't know, I can't judge the south with the north but I mean, his work ethic which means some of the ways he approaches life, he's not a, he's in his 40s already now. 

03:14:35
UNKNOWN Right. 

03:14:35
WILLIAM GLASSER I mean, it's not like he's gonna change a great deal at this stage of the game. 

03:14:40
UNKNOWN Right and then he's not happy in what he's doing.

03:15:00
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

03:15:00
UNKNOWN There is in this part, wants to let it go. 

03:15:05
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Now what would revenge do for you? 

03:15:05
UNKNOWN Make me feel better. 

03:15:10
STEVE ANDREAS It will make you feel better. I'd like you to feel better. I don't think revenge is the best way to do it. It's a way. Now tell me, tell me this. Close your eyes and go into wild revenge fantasies. What would you do if you had a totally omnipotence and you had all the power in the world and you could take revenge on this guy. Beat him to a bloody pulp or whatever. How would that make you feel? 

03:15:40
UNKNOWN Like I won. 

03:15:45
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. So would you feel stronger? 

03:15:50
UNKNOWN No I would say it feel equal. 

03:15:55
STEVE ANDREAS Equal. So you feel unequal now. 

03:15:55
UNKNOWN I want him to feel the hurt that I felt. 

03:16:00
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. And that will make you feel equal. Is there any other way that you can feel equal to him or even superior because you don't, forgiveness is something that not many can accomplish. It takes a good deal of strength of character and compassion and a lot of human qualities.

03:16:35
UNKNOWN … to do is travel. I want to see the world. That's always… 

03:16:40
WILLIAM GLASSER uh… do you do it? Have you done it as a teacher? Teachers travel on summers and things. 

03:16:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, I've been out of the country three times and I've enjoyed it. Umm… I just, it's like, I just live too, you know, go see exotic places and you know or just do different things and that is like but I want to do actually is see the world. 

03:17:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Do you, do you travel, you have traveled three times out of the country and traveled in the country I'm sure. 

03:17:05
UNKNOWN Right. 

03:17:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Do you travel all by yourself or with others? 

03:17:10
UNKNOWN Umm… I usually go by myself because… Right, I what I usually do is umm… I'll hook up with the, with the travel group overseas and umm… my friends are married or you know divorced or whatever and they don't, you know, it's expensive to go receive. They have no dependence, so it's easier for me. 

03:17:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Right. 

03:17:30
UNKNOWN So what I'll usually do is I'll book a trip and, and meet like a tour group over, you know. 

03:17:35
WILLIAM GLASSER And on the group, you can find people who are looking for friends. You, you find. 

03:17:35
UNKNOWN Oh, it's great, I mean it's absolutely wonderful. Everybody feels sorry for me that I do this by myself and it's like, if you don't pick the right traveling partner, they could bring your whole tip. 

03:17:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Oh yeah. 

03:17:50
UNKNOWN So with a group, it's like you have friends when you want them and people to do things but if you want to go do something on your own, it's, you have that option always enjoyed it. 

03:17:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Have you ever hooked up with a love relationship on a trip? 

03:18:00
UNKNOWN No. 

03:18:00
WILLIAM GLASSER I'm not saying, it's easy. I just wanted to if you had let go. 

03:18:05
UNKNOWN Not overseas, no. so umm… 

03:18:10
WILLIAM GLASSER When you were going with this guy now and you're home alone sometimes two, three weeks at a time, you're telling. Do you ever look at anybody else? 

03:18:20
UNKNOWN Umm… I've thought about it. I don't umm… 

03:18:20
WILLIAM GLASSER I'm not saying go have an affair. I'm just not think about other people. 

03:18:25
UNKNOWN You know, I mean there have been, you know, times when I went out, I've totally denied, I'm, I have somebody in my life and you know, I don't know why I did that but… 

03:18:40
WILLIAM GLASSER That you do it. 

03:18:40
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

03:18:40
WILLIAM GLASSER You don't have to feel terrible about it. 

03:18:40
UNKNOWN Not at all. So I thought well, maybe it's not that honest thing to do but I don't know, no I've never, you know… 

03:18:50
WILLIAM GLASSER You're kind of going steady with him but…

Paradox 

03:19:35
PAUL PELUSO Let's talk about time travel. Yes, time travel. Now imagine you go back in time about 60 or 70 years ago and meet your own grandmother when she was a child. Long before she meets your grandfather and before she gives birth to your mother. Umm… fortunately you carry a germ that isn't present in the past say the bird flew and accidentally infect your grandmother. 

03:20:00
UNKNOWN Uh-ohh. 

03:20:05
PAUL PELUSO And she dies. So your mother was never born and subsequently, you were never born. 

03:20:10
UNKNOWN Uh-ohh. 

03:20:10
PAUL PELUSO Still with me. Good because here is where it gets complicated. You see, if you were never born because your mother was never born because your grandmother died of bird flu that you gave her because you went back in time, then your grandmother would be instantly alive again but if she's alive again, then you would be alive again because your mother would be born and then you would be born. And you will then go back if time to meet your grandmother and give her the bird flu which would cause her to die. Then you would never be born and which would cause her to be alive again because you didn't go back in time, well, you get the picture. It will go on and on again in an endless loop. This is what's known as a paradox and it's one of the most perplexing and powerful tools in a clinician's tool box but more on that in a little bit. First what is a paradox? A paradox is any two ideas that on a surface can't seem to coexist together but in reality they do. It's seemingly absurd like the time traveler's paradox but it's logically consistent and true. Now this is a classic paradox. First the two elements. One there is a box and inside the box everything in it is a lie and the second element is the statement, everything in the box is a lie. So what's the paradox, you ask. Well, they can get through. If everything in the box is a lie, then the statement everything in the box is a lie isn't true. Well, if the statement everything in the box is a lie isn't true, then that means that everything in the box is true which actually is a lie because everything in the box is a lie which would actually then be true. But, oh, it gets complicated, doesn't it? It's absurd. These two can't coexist together yet there they are and it's this kind of circular thinking or non-linear thinking that master practitioners use which separates them from novice clinicians. Traditionally paradox interventions have been defined as merely prescribing the symptoms for example, if a client wants to stop smoking cigarettes, you merely advice him to keep smoking more that kind of thing. Their problem is that this could be dangerous. Uh… if a client is threatening to harm themselves then prescribing the symptom is not okay. So remember, it's always important to practice safe paradox. So why are these so great? I mean, what's the big deal? Well, a paradoxical intervention is powerful because a good one will incorporate all six of the previous domains. It connects and engages the client. It addresses both the weakness and strengths in assessment. It builds the therapeutic relationship. It accounts for the client's schema dynamics. Emotional system and it understands and helps to resolve any ambivalence. But perhaps the most important reason why paradoxical interventions work is because they use non-linear thinking. Non-linear thinking breaks down the client's old way of thinking about things. It shatters their previous held conceptions. You know, Albert Einstein, a pretty non-linear thinker himself once said, you cannot solve a problem at the same level of thinking that created it. And that's what a good paradoxical intervention does. It opens up new avenues and new ideas. It creates a eureka or aha moment and oftentimes the client says, you know, I never thought of it in that way before. Now there is some elements of non-linear thinking too consider when using paradoxical interventions. They are reframing, looking for the positives and the negatives, looking for opposites and advocating benignly for the status quo. Oh, it's getting crowded in here. 

03:24:00
[sil.] 

03:24:05
PAUL PELUSO Reframing is one of the most important tools that a clinician has of taking the client's life or circumstances and putting it into a new context and presenting them with a different way of seeing things. It's kind of like taking this picture and putting it into a lousy frame. It just ruins the picture. Now if you put it into a different frame, it's the same picture but it looks an awful lot better. Old frame, lousy. New frame better. Loss at heart at any age and sometimes it feels better not to feel the pain and so you know, we distract ourselves by doing all sorts of things like you did in high school but the reality is it never really does make that pain go away. So you lash out at the people around you and lash out at people at work, you lash out at people that you love at home, like your fiancé and you're hurt, you hurt others which then in turn only winds up hurting you. 

03:25:00
UNKNOWN I never really that about it like that. 

03:25:05
PAUL PELUSO You know, it occurs to me this kind of reminds me the story of the lion with the thorn stuck in his paw, you know, he's got this thorn in his paw and he's in a lot of pain and he roars. He's, you know, roaring and lashing out and everyone around him is scared. So they run away and that only makes him feel even more hurt and more betrayed because there is nobody around to help him. All he wants is for somebody to just take the thorn out of his paw. 

03:25:30
UNKNOWN I remember that story. Always thought the lion was just misunderstood. Never thought it was the lion. 

03:25:35
PAUL PELUSO Yeah, I think actually the lion. Another part of non-linear thinking that goes in the paradoxical interventions is looking for opposites or looking for the positives in uh… a negative situation. Now this takes real non-linear thinking. Uh… consider what we talked about in domain two, listening for congruence and absence, presence, inference and resistance. With this information, you have to ask yourself for what is the opposite of this or what might be beneficial in this particular circumstance or situation? It's a way of trying to inspire some hope in the client when they feel hopeless for any kind of positive change to happen. You know we're not done creatures. We don't adopt strategies or philosophies that don't work for us, we adopt philosophies and strategies that do work for us. So how do you think this strategy or this philosophy works for you? 

03:26:25
UNKNOWN Losing my temper, getting angry? 

03:26:30
PAUL PELUSO Yeah. 

03:26:30
UNKNOWN Well, I suppose people, people avoid me. They get out of my way. 

03:26:40
PAUL PELUSO Okay. So it actually does help you there. You don't have to deal with people that are annoying, people that are upsetting you. 

03:26:45
UNKNOWN I guess so. I never thought about it like that. 

03:26:45
PAUL PELUSO Yeah, but the problem though is that it can spill over to people that you care about. You push away people like your fiancé. 

03:26:55
UNKNOWN My fiancé, yeah I guess I suppose you're right but I mean, I don't want to push her away. 

03:27:00
PAUL PELUSO Is that something you might like to change? 

03:27:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, it is. 

03:27:05
PAUL PELUSO Often what you see is the opposite is just as true for the client but they never saw it that way before. They got rigidly stuck in the one way of thinking or one way of seeing things only. By looking at the opposite or pointing out the positives and the negative, it can instill some hope for change in the client where they had abandoned all hope. The last domain in non-linear thinking when using paradoxical interventions is sometimes you have to be benignly advocate for the status quo. This is especially important when clients come in at one of the earliest stages of change say pre-contemplation. Sometimes clients come in because they think, it's the right thing to do but they haven't fully committed to change or sometimes they are being forced in the therapy. Advocating benignly for the status quo means that you get them to slow down. You get to really consider if they are ready to change right now or if they really want to change. 

03:28:00
UNKNOWN I lost it. I freaked out, I screamed, I called my husband, told him he needed to get home immediately because I couldn't deal with it. I went up to my room, locked myself in there with a headache and I didn't come out for the next day and I mean, I think it was Saturday, so I didn't have to work and I, I didn't have to worry about coming out. 

03:28:20
PAUL PELUSO Well, I'm, I'm wondering, you know, first I'm, I'm not a woman so I can't know what it's like to have to pull all that together. But you know, last week aside, you know, you're able to successfully manage a marriage, two kids and a very important job. So I'm wondering, you know, how do you do it? What, what do you use in order to be able to put all that together? 

03:28:45
UNKNOWN I, I just do it. 

03:28:45
PAUL PELUSO Oftentimes by just taking that pressure off and asking that question, clients can find the resolve to change or find the real reason behind why they want to change or they may be able to find a good reason not to change and sometimes that maybe progress as well. Whatever it is, it's usually opposite of what they think a counselor is going to ask them to do and that's what makes it non-linear. We group paradoxical interventions into four types. The neutralizers, the tranquilizers, energizers and challengers. First, the neutralizers. The neutralizers are used often in the beginning of therapy when clients maybe nervous or ambivalent about coming to therapy. They neutralize the potentially acidic comments by the client. It's kind of like this red wine here. Red wine is acidic. You add something like ammonia to it and it changes it from an acid to a base or from red wine to blue. Well, it's the same with neutralizers. This can be done with a well timed, boundary setting or with some discreet humor. 

03:29:50
UNKNOWN Listen, when I was a teenager, I was forced to go to counseling. This woman was like a gypsy or a fortune teller or something. She would light candles and incense and you know what, it did nothing for me. So I don't really see what you're gonna be able to do for me. 

03:30:10
PAUL PELUSO I can understand that and I've, I've met some people like that in my time. Uh… a lot of counselors have a lot of different styles. That's not my style. But uh… I can promise you that I won't do any incense or candles but I'll make a deal with you. If we're going through this and you're telling me that this doesn't work for you, we'll find some other way. What do you say? 

03:30:30
UNKNOWN All right. 

03:30:35
PAUL PELUSO Okay. Next are the tranquilizers. No, no, not that kind of tranquilizer. These are the paradoxical interventions that are designed to take all the client's wildly fanatic behavior that is not helping to solve their problem though they think it is and get them to slow down so they see that doing less is more and that acting out of panic usually creates more chaos. Now this can be done by giving permission or having them postpone certain behavior or using persuasion or sometimes prohibition. 

03:31:05
UNKNOWN I'll never be replaced again. 

03:31:10
PAUL PELUSO That sounds like it's playing out in your life right now. And I think you have kind of a go to strategy make sure that doesn't happen. You try to make yourself irreplaceable. You try to do everything for everyone and try to organize it as best that you can and not really ask anybody for help and in that way, they can't replace you. 

03:31:35
UNKNOWN I never thought about it like that before. 

03:31:40
PAUL PELUSO It's sending it home, it's the same pattern. You know, you try to do everything and not make it inconvenient for anybody else in the hopes that they won't replace you. That you'll be irreplaceable. But you know at the end of it all, there is a cost. You don't feel very connected. You don't feel like you're kind of on the inside. 

03:32:05
UNKNOWN No. I, I don't feel connected in a long time. Maybe never, I don't know. 

03:32:15
PAUL PELUSO Kind of like you did as a little girl. 

03:32:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. Wishing that I was a little girl and that someone could see it. I needed help. 

03:32:25
PAUL PELUSO Somebody who actually could give you that help would come to you. 

03:32:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:32:30
PAUL PELUSO Then we have the energizers. These are the paradoxical interventions that are designed to shock the system. Particularly when clients have begun to give up and stop actively trying to solve their problem. Sometimes these clients are depressed. Other times they are angry and hurt. Whatever the case, their inaction is not a solution and their protest that they've tried everything or doing the best they can are usually just an excuse. Energizers are designed to get them moving and free up the energy that they have that they are not using to solve or manage their problems. This can be done by deliberate practice or having the client teach the problem behavior or redefining the problem in a prosocial way. Okay now with your husband, you're gonna need to ask him for some help. Now, I know, he hasn't been very good at doing that in the past but here is what we're gonna strategize a little bit. Now, you said that he's a games man. He is a fisherman, all right, well, you are gonna have to try to make it a little bit of a game for him. 

03:33:35
UNKNOWN What do you mean? 

03:33:35
PAUL PELUSO Well, I think you have to make it fun. So what I'm thinking of is proposing that the two of you work together on, on being able to go out on a date. 

03:33:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:33:50
PAUL PELUSO So the deal would be this. You say to him, you ask him uh… if he wants to go out with you and that you'll be in charge of taking care of the logistics of the baby-sitting. 

03:34:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:34:00
PAUL PELUSO And he has to be in charge of planning out the evenings events. 

03:34:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:34:05
PAUL PELUSO Then at the end of the evening, if all goes well, tell him that he gets a prize. He gets to catch you. 

03:34:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:34:15
PAUL PELUSO Now, you've been married for years and you have two kids. So I'm sure, you can figure out how that's going to go. 

03:34:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, exactly. 

03:34:20
PAUL PELUSO But the most important thing here is, I think three things. Number one, that you guys work together, that number two, you connect and feel connected emotionally uh… to each other and then third thing probably the most important thing of all, you have fun, you have fun doing it, you, you think, you can do that? 

03:34:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

03:34:45
PAUL PELUSO Lastly there are the challengers. These are the paradoxical interventions that are designed to challenge a person's rigid way of behaving in hoping of getting him to snap into a new way of behaving. It's kind of like uh… a grain of sand in an oyster that is designed to create a pearl. Now a word of caution. These can be very tricky but when they work, they work stupendously and this can be done with things like positive provocation or by distorting the proportion of the client's thinking or that old stand by prescribing the symptom. 

03:35:20
UNKNOWN Well, disappointed but I don't want to be weak. I don't want to lose. 

03:35:20
PAUL PELUSO Okay. You don't want to be weak, don't want to lose. What if I told you there is a way to be strong and win? 

03:35:30
UNKNOWN I'd be interested in that. 

03:35:30
PAUL PELUSO Okay, well let me ask you something. What do you think takes more strength? Lashing out or holding back when you want to lash out? 

03:35:40
UNKNOWN Probably holding back. 

03:35:40
PAUL PELUSO Okay. What do you think takes more strength? Confronting the pain or running away from the pain? 

03:35:50
UNKNOWN Confronting the pain. 

03:35:50
PAUL PELUSO So then everything you've done up till now that you thought was strong is actually weakness. 

03:36:00
UNKNOWN I guess so. 

03:36:00
PAUL PELUSO You… 

03:36:00
UNKNOWN Tell me about your mother. 

03:36:05
PAUL PELUSO I love my mother. Go away. Now, let's take a look at some video examples in various clinical settings.

03:36:20
Energizer 

03:36:25
UNKNOWN Umm… probably nothing. Because I've shocking them so many times. 

03:36:30
BRAD KEENY So you are good at shocking. 

03:36:30
UNKNOWN Oh, very good in shocking. 

03:36:30
BRAD KEENY Yeah, yeah. 

03:36:30
UNKNOWN My mother says I'm the queen of shocking. 

03:36:35
BRAD KEENY Oh, Really. But you're telling me now that you can't come up with another way, that you're holding back. 

03:36:40
UNKNOWN And maybe, maybe they watch him to buy movie ticket, Because they watch him to buy movie ticket maybe they just, I don't know, I don't know. 

03:36:50
BRAD KEENY Have you shocked him in the past if you are the master of shock? 

03:36:55
UNKNOWN Probably just things I saw there things I've read in the newspaper. 

03:37:00
BRAD KEENY Yeah. 

03:37:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:37:05
BRAD KEENY So this is something, you are skilled at this. 

03:37:05
UNKNOWN I am very skilled at this. 

03:37:05
BRAD KEENY I want to hear more about this. Tell me more about this ability to shock. What kind of, what kind of things are shocking things, all other things that you can say? 

03:37:15
UNKNOWN Well my friends taught me how to umm… put a code like figure out the number and the letter and put them on the beeper like if I was to say, I love you, I will put the numbers for I love you or the letters for I love you, the numbers will always get numbers for I love you and then he'll call me back and he goes, did you beep me? I'd say, yes, I beeped you. He goes, what did you say, I go, look at the phone and figure it out. It took him probably about a half hour but he was like oh, I like this. 

03:37:50
BRAD KEENY So what's the last time you exercised? 

03:37:50
UNKNOWN I did it today. I do that today. 

03:37:50
BRAD KEENY Did he like him. 

03:37:55
UNKNOWN He was very surprised. 

03:37:55
BRAD KEENY See. 

03:37:55
UNKNOWN This morning, he called me and told me it worked and he did not this measure is gonna work. So this afternoon, there is a tear in my eye, I beat that. 

03:38:10
BRAD KEENY So you do have this special talent and resource of a shocking, that's proven to be something wonderful for the relationship. 

03:38:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:38:20
BRAD KEENY So, how would you, would you I mean, can you send the message to him that he would be able to figure out that you're inviting him for a walk? 

03:38:30
UNKNOWN I hope, we can do that. 

03:38:30
BRAD KEENY Yeah. 

03:38:30
UNKNOWN Of course, thinking down, sit down, ten second if I were, I would do that. 

03:38:35
UNKNOWN So that would be very interesting. And maybe you can use that as a tool for how to talk to him about things that aren't so easy to talk about. Maybe you'd come up with a special arrangement that, that sensitive issues are only to be addressed in code. You know. I'm not sure exactly how you do it. I mean, it's gonna take a lot of messages on the, on the machine but, but you could arrange something. I'm sure, you can do that with. 

03:39:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, I probably could. 

03:39:05
BRAD KEENY Your mother said, you're, you're a master at this, yes. 

03:39:10
UNKNOWN That's true. 

03:39:10
BRAD KEENY So now we've hit, we've hit some interesting territory that is we found a skill that you held back from telling me. That is you have the skill of shocking and you used it with him and it's been effective. You ever shock yourself? 

03:39:30
UNKNOWN No. 

03:39:30
BRAD KEENY Just others? 

03:39:30
UNKNOWN No, just others. 

03:39:30
BRAD KEENY Care to think about what it would mean to shock yourself? 

03:39:35
UNKNOWN No. 

03:39:35
BRAD KEENY I don't know what that mean but it might be an interesting thing for you to think about. 

03:39:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

03:39:40
BRAD KEENY Yeah. Because you, you analyze things, yes? 

03:39:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

03:39:40
BRAD KEENY Over and over? 

03:39:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

03:39:45
BRAD KEENY So would there be a way to analyze things that will shock you like you could create out of your imagination, that's shocking analysis. 

03:39:50
UNKNOWN That's, I think I have done that before maybe. 

03:39:55
BRAD KEENY Really? 

03:39:55
UNKNOWN I do have a make believe land or pretend. 

03:40:00
BRAD KEENY Excellent. This is wonderful. This is such a valuable thing. Does it make you giggle or when you, when you make the sort of a wild explanation of things? Does it, does it make you put your funny bone or does it? 

03:40:10
UNKNOWN Maybe. 

03:40:15
BRAD KEENY Is it your weird bone? 

03:40:15
UNKNOWN My fuuny bone or weird bone. Maybe I don't. Frank always says, I don't laugh anymore like I used to laugh. I don't joke around anymore the way I used to joke around. Maybe I really don't. 

03:40:25
BRAD KEENY You know, what I'm thinking. You need to announce loudly and clearly that the shock is back into your life. You need to say it to yourself. I'm bringing back the shock, the shock is back. 

03:40:40
UNKNOWN The shock is back. 

03:40:45
BRAD KEENY The shock is back. And you know what, what plays itself out of my imagination is that little device, I don't know, if you can still buy them. When I was a kid, they used to have those little devices you'd wind up and you shake somebody's hand and it buzz them. 

03:40:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

03:40:55
BRAD KEENY Did you ever have them? That's truly a shock. 

03:41:00
UNKNOWN It really is. 

03:41:00
BRAD KEENY Do they still make those? 

03:41:00
UNKNOWN I don't know. I don't really shop on trick stores but I can probably look for one. 

03:41:05
BRAD KEENY I bet, there is one. They cannot, cannot be extinct. There has to be out there. But what a wonderful way to announce to the family and to your husband that the shock is back. 

03:41:15
UNKNOWN The shock is back. I'm back.

UNKNOWN I think, he does. 

03:41:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Well, I, I, why do you think that when he hasn't said anything? 

03:41:35
UNKNOWN I just think he's trying to be nice and not put pressure on me. But I don't think it's good for him for his congregants to be noticing them, sure. 

03:41:45
MARSHA LINEHAN So what would happen if you asked him, don't you think it would help you get yourself downtown, if he actually told you he cared? 

03:41:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, maybe. 

03:41:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Because that would make it more visible to you. Okay. 

03:42:00
UNKNOWN That's true. 

03:42:00
MARSHA LINEHAN So one thing I'd suggest is asking him if he cares. Okay. 

03:42:05
[sil.] 

03:42:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Umm… the only other thing right now, it seems to me that the only way to get yourself to be on time is to make up a series of rules for yourself where you say, you're not allowed to more to believe that you can wash your hair and get ready faster. Because there seems to be the one area that you're probably unlikely to cut back on, no matter what. And, and the real promise been, it's that you get yourself in the shower too late and you're not willing to not wash your hair and do all the things to get dressed. You know, you're not willing to look unattractive at church. 

03:42:45
UNKNOWN So should I just talk back to myself, so… 

03:42:50
UNKNOWN One thing you do is as your husband whether, he would rather have you unattractive or late attractive.

03:43:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

03:43:15
MARSHA LINEHAN All right. So as long as you're willing to miss the exercise, you don't have to write. 

03:43:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

03:43:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

03:43:25
UNKNOWN I'm willing. 

03:43:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. I figured. 

03:43:30
UNKNOWN It scares me a little bit, yes, it's good, it's a good consequence because there is a lot tied up in that. 

03:43:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, I'm sure, I can tell. 

03:43:35
UNKNOWN Aha. 

03:43:35

LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So what you're telling me is that after getting beaten down physically and mentally, you're like, you're like a concentration camp victim or you know someone who, who has, who has been… 

03:44:10
UNKNOWN Just used it that you know, just so used it to. 

03:44:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah the box are down on the ring, I guess beaten so much that they don't even try to get up anymore.

03:44:30
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:44:35
JUDY BECK Umm… now, let's take the same picture where you're back in that room and looking out at the view. Is there some way that you could figure out to change the, the picture in your mind so that actually you're feeling stronger and feel once if you're moving ahead in life? 

03:44:50
UNKNOWN No put some furniture. 

03:44:50
JUDY BECK Put some furniture. That's one thing. 

03:44:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. Uh… I think I could change the picture. Umm… 

03:44:55
JUDY BECK What kind of furniture would you put in that room? 

03:45:00
UNKNOWN Well, we have a great apartment. I'd like to uh… nice couch, bedroom, I mean, uh… nice couch if it can fit. 

03:45:10
JUDY BECK Uh…. 

03:45:15
UNKNOWN A bed, pictures, family pictures. 

03:45:15
JUDY BECK And would you like to, would you like to imagine your kids jumping on the bed or something? 

03:45:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah that. 

03:45:20
JUDY BECK Having fun in the room. 

03:45:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:45:25
JUDY BECK What do you see them doing? You know, I don't know them, so… 

03:45:25
UNKNOWN Jumping on the bed. 

03:45:25
JUDY BECK Okay, yes, I do know. 

03:45:30
UNKNOWN That's what they'd probably be doing. Jumping on the bed. 

03:45:30
JUDY BECK Okay, so now when you have this picture in your head and the room is furnished and it's got pictures on the wall and there is a couch and a bed and you see that you got, you got three kids and they are jumping on the bed, how does that make you feel emotionally? 

03:45:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, it does. 

03:45:50
JUDY BECK Yeah. You know the fact of the matter is that we don't know whether or not you're gonna end up in that room again. My guess is somebody else probably lives there. 

03:45:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:45:55
JUDY BECK Is that right? So it's not likely. 

03:45:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:46:00
JUDY BECK That you can end up in that room. So it's just something that you, you had a fantasy about. 

03:46:00
UNKNOWN Right. 

03:46:05
JUDY BECK So what I'm suggesting is that you take, since it's just a fantasy, it's not true anyway. 

03:46:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:46:05
JUDY BECK Take that fantasy and improve it. 

03:46:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:46:10
JUDY BECK In a way that makes you feel better. 

03:46:10
UNKNOWN Okay.

Paradoxical Intervention

Tranquilizer 

03:46:20
MICHAEL YAPKO If I criticize you, how do you know whether to pay attention to it, how do you know whether to listen to it, how do you know whether to take it seriously or whether to dismiss it? 

03:46:30
UNKNOWN I seem to take a lot of things seriously. It could be just joking whatever but I take it seriously. 

03:46:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. But the question really asking is, how do you know whether you should take it seriously? You're telling me that you do take it seriously, but I'm asking you the question of how do you know whether you should? 

03:46:50
UNKNOWN I don't. 

03:46:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. Seems to me that, that would be a really valuable thing for you to be able to have is some internal mechanism that helps you decide whether or not it's worth paying attention to. And one of the things, I don't know, if you've ever talked to other people about the inner voices that they have inside their own heads, where they replay bad things that have happened and the self-criticisms that they generate and all the junk that goes on up there. But if you were to do what I do, which is when I have hundreds of people in a room and I ask them who among you has good self-esteem? Hands go up, all hands go up. Now I ask them, do you have an inner critic? Do you have a voice inside your head that criticizes you and says rotten things to you and puts you down and says mean and horrible things to you? And every single one says yes. If I ask them about, if you have a voice that says rotten things to you, how can you have good self-esteem? And the interesting reply, it's always a little bit different but the common bottom-line is, they don't listen to it. When I ask them how do you not listen to it, that's when I start learning all kinds of different strategies. One person will say, well, I picture it as being on a volume control knob and I just turn the volume down. Somebody else says, I picture it as a barking dog tied to a tree and I just keep walking. Somebody else says, uh… yeah, I have another voice on my shoulder that says good things to me. But the interesting thing is that every single person has that inner critic, that critical voice, it's just a question of whether they listen to it or not. Now to me that was a very, very powerful learning from being around and asking those kinds of questions to literally thousands of people but you'll notice in the question that I ask you, do you have some mechanism where by you don't have to listen to it or you decide, it's not offering me anything valuable here. All it's doing is keeping me stuck in the gutter as you said without that kind of mechanism, you're always gonna be stuck listening to it and one is say anything to you, other than negative stuff. 

03:49:00
UNKNOWN Right. 

03:49:05
MICHAEL YAPKO It's not as if everything it say to you, Jim, like you're great, Jim like you're wonderful. Aren't you the best, aren't you lucky to be who you are? You know, that's, that's not what people who feel good about themselves do. So in a way I'm kind of giving you a target to aim for that A, having the ability to develop a mechanism for not listening to it when you know that it's taking you some place that you really don't want to go because when you're going to escape all the triggers, when are you going to escape the sounds, the smells, the images. You can be watching a television show, you can be watching a movie, you can, I mean the triggers are always gonna be out there. You're not gonna be able to change the external world. But what goes inside your mind is imminently negotiable.

03:50:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:50:15
MICHAEL YAPKO What are you gonna do? 

03:50:15

03:50:25

03:50:30

03:50:45
UNKNOWN Eight months. 

03:50:45
STEVE ANDREAS Eight months. So you know him pretty well. 

03:50:45
UNKNOWN I thought I did. 

03:50:50
STEVE ANDREAS Well, now you know him better. 

03:50:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:50:50
STEVE ANDREAS Not in the way you want it but… 

03:50:55
UNKNOWN No. 

03:50:55
STEVE ANDREAS But now you know him better. Usually in blame there is the pre-supposition that he could have done differently. 

03:51:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:51:05
STEVE ANDREAS Now, I think maybe with some therapy or with some knock at one side of the head or something like that, he can probably do differently. 

03:51:10
UNKNOWN Probably. 

03:51:15
STEVE ANDREAS But at this time, he was, who he was, he did what he did and you needed to maintain your values, whatever went on, violated your values, right and you needed to, this is it. Can you understand that he couldn't have done any differently than he did? 

03:51:35
UNKNOWN No. 

03:51:35
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, let me try another one. Can you think of sometime in the past when you harmed someone else? Maybe unintentionally or whatever. And now looking back on it, I assume, you have some regret. You're right? 

03:51:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

03:51:50
STEVE ANDREAS Now at the moment that you harmed them, could you have done anything different? 

03:51:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:51:55
STEVE ANDREAS I don't think so. This is where your self-forgiveness. That umm… I have the idea, crazy or not that everybody always does the best they can given their knowledge, given their background, given their habits, their economics and so on and so on so. People make the best choices they can at the time. And I think that you made the best choice, you could at that time given what you knew at that moment even though it resulted in harming someone. 

03:52:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:52:30
STEVE ANDREAS Is that true, does that make…

03:52:40
STEVE ANDREAS In here, you express some compassion for him. Right? What if you talk to him like that? What if you told him about how badly he hurt you but then a voice that was not angry and blaming that just talking about yourself, just to let him know because that's important to you, isn't it? To let him know that. But in such a way that you're telling him about yourself not blaming him, saying, look, when you lied to me or whatever it was blah, blah, blah, well, it was like a knife in my heart, how would you describe it so that he could know what impact he's having on the world? 

03:53:25
[sil.] 

03:53:30
STEVE ANDREAS My guess is you'd like to protect somebody else from this, wouldn't you? 

03:53:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:53:35
STEVE ANDREAS In the future, if he's with somebody else, would you want them to go through the same thing you went through? So you would like to have an impact on him right even if you never see him again, it would be nice, if you could say, hey that didn't work for me, that hurt me or whatever, your words would be. And I can understand that what he did, didn't fit for you. 

03:54:05
[sil.] 

03:54:10

WILLIAM GLASSER She is with a nice man and we've met him and he's a nice guy.

WILLIAM GLASSER And all that stuff and, and I mean, settled down doesn't sound that exciting to you. 

03:56:00
UNKNOWN No, it doesn't. 

03:56:05
WILLIAM GLASSER How about excitement, is there any excitement in your life, I mean? 

03:56:10
UNKNOWN Well, my favorite thing… 

03:56:15
Steve Andreas, M.A. 

03:56:15
Resistance / Reframing 

03:56:20
STEVE ANDREAS Do you think, they're gonna listen to you better if you blew off and outraged at him or if you were calm? 

03:56:25
UNKNOWN If I was calm. 

03:56:25
STEVE ANDREAS I think so. So if you really wanted to change your bureaucracy or if you want to change some other situations, let's say, somebody else is disrespectful of you, wouldn't it actually be easier, if you can just be calm and centered and self-composed. You say, look, I didn't like what you did. That doesn't fit for me. I want you to change it. 

03:56:45
UNKNOWN But they don't listen. They never listen. 

03:56:50
STEVE ANDREAS Sometimes, they won't listen, do you think they are gonna listen better if you're angry or if you're calm? 

03:56:55
UNKNOWN Well, how if I start off calm then I get angry if they don't listen. 

03:57:00
STEVE ANDREAS You can always get angry, you are at that, you know how to do that, right. We're not into taking away choices here. 

03:57:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:57:10
STEVE ANDREAS You can always get angry later and sometimes anger umm… gets people to notice you. But you know, there are other times when people just say, oh, well they are just angry and so they just blown it off and they just say, well, it's just because she's so emotional, you know, more than I. 

03:57:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:57:20
STEVE ANDREAS That stuff. 

03:57:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

03:57:25
STEVE ANDREAS You can probably got it now. 

03:57:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, right. 

03:57:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. So now… 

03:57:35
Steve Hayes, Ph.D. 

03:57:35
STEVE HAYES Somebody that you want to get close to. Is your painful part, your lonely part, the pain of that judgment your enemy or does it tell you something about what you want? 

03:57:55
[sil.] 

03:58:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, I mean, yeah, it does, I mean, it, yeah. Tells me how much I want to be close to somebody. 

03:58:15
STEVE HAYES Okay. 

03:58:15
UNKNOWN And how much I want my relationship to work. 

03:58:20
STEVE HAYES Okay. Now if you, if you have that but it's kind of out in the future and let's pull it into the present, so it isn't just like, I want to have a good relationship, right. 

03:58:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

03:58:30
STEVE HAYES But it's something more like, I want to step towards that kind of connection that I know something about and that hurts when it was not there. What, what are you gonna have to carry? I asked you if we had that pain on one side or it was on the other side, okay. Suppose, these are two flip sides of the same thing. Suppose that sweet spot and the pain and the loneliness judgment, lack of safety, lack of creating a place, of adults creating a place where you can play, what if that sweet spot and that pain are two sides of the same coin? And suppose, I give it to you and I say, here is this thing and you can get rid of it. You can hide their loneliness and the pain and the suffering that you're gonna have to throw at both sides. I'm sorry, you got to throw away, the sweet spot too. You can't care about that. 

03:59:30
UNKNOWN Uh… because it's possible. 

03:59:30
STEVE HAYES Or you could, well, you kind of in a way have been doing it, you know. You've been trying to throw it away and then getting mad that if this other side gets thrown too. 

03:59:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

03:59:40
STEVE HAYES You know, what I'm saying. Okay, so here it is, we got a piece of paper here, like this little thing… 

03:59:50
Judy Beck, Ph.D. 

03:59:50
JUDY BECK Okay, making some good stuff toward it. 

03:59:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:59:55
JUDY BECK The only thing I was trying to get across tonight is that the reason, you feel so sad and anxious sometimes are because of thoughts that you have. 

04:00:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

04:00:05
JUDY BECK So if you have thoughts like umm… what if I lose mom uh… before I get my independence, I won't make it, these kinds of thoughts are gonna undermine you. 

04:00:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

04:00:15
JUDY BECK It will make you feel really anxious or sad. 

04:00:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

04:00:20
JUDY BECK And you can't necessarily stop the thoughts from coming into your head but once they come into your head and you can say to yourself, well, wait a minute, how do I know that, that's true? 

04:00:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

04:00:25
JUDY BECK Maybe it's not nearly true. 

04:00:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

04:00:30
JUDY BECK Maybe it's not as true as it feels right now. 

04:00:30
UNKNOWN Okay. 

04:00:35
JUDY BECK And that's, you give me an example before about mom, oh, even the thought I might lose mom and then you thought it over, later on and you said to yourself, now wait a minute, if she was criticizing me, she's actually very strong. 

04:00:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

04:00:45
JUDY BECK So that's the kind of thing that I'm talking about. Those when you are feeling really anxious or depressed is to look for thoughts or pictures that are going through your head. 

04:00:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

04:01:00
JUDY BECK And, and kind of evaluate them critically and think to yourself how true are they? 

04:01:05
UNKNOWN Okay. Okay, how true are the thoughts? 

04:01:10
[sil.] 

04:01:20
JUDY BECK If it's a picture going through your mind, you can try to change the picture in the way, that we did before. 

04:01:25
UNKNOWN Okay. Change the picture. 

04:01:30
[sil.] 

04:01:35
JUDY BECK Okay, so if you could somehow, a little bit of what we talked about tonight. 

04:01:40
Marsha Linehan 

04:01:45
MARSHA LINEHAN …been expecting that anger will be required to actually get the schedule changed? So it might be more empathy for that person but it might be true if the person going to change it without a blow up. You're in a lot of trouble if that's true. You're in a world of trouble if only anger works in your agency. 

04:02:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

04:02:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. But then if only and a lot of people are in that situation with only in that work is angry behavior. But the trick to angry behavior then is to do it skillfully. In other words to be in control of the angry behavior. 

04:02:20
[sil.] 

04:02:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Acting angry in other words can be useful but it's usually a lot more useful if you're not angry when you act angry. You will be more strict when you're, you can be more strategic. 

04:02:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

04:02:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So the other thing to notice is whether you get your way, you get… 

04:02:45
Steve Hayes, Ph.D. 

04:02:45
STEVE HAYES This side gets thrown too. 

04:02:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

04:02:50
STEVE HAYES You know, what I'm saying. Okay, so here it is, we got a piece of paper here, just like this little thing. We got two sides of it. We got this vulnerable, we got this vulnerable little girl that got her loneliness, her pain yeah and then we've got this part of you that knows what it's like to be connected, to be in it. 

04:03:10
UNKNOWN Oh, I wouldn't throw that away, oh for anything. 

04:03:15
STEVE HAYES Okay. Suppose in order to take it, you take both sides, are you willing? 

04:03:15
UNKNOWN It's worth it, it's worth it. Absolutely? 

04:03:20
STEVE HAYES Okay, okay, so when you get in there and your mom is telling you, you got to throw this part away. Shut out, stop talking so much, you silly, giggly and don't tell anybody, they may find out. Yeah, as you buy into that, it's turning up saying, I don't, I'm not gonna ever, it's not thrown away that. I don't care about this. You're with me on this. Just listen what I'm saying? I wish I had it physically here. Oh, I'm actually gonna do it physically. This is the both sides. Let's just see if we can do it. It magically has my name on, really what it is. Like a sad little girl, before you grab in you got the, caring, the connection that you want. Now I want you to make a choice here. 

04:04:15
UNKNOWN I wouldn't get rid of it. 

04:04:20
STEVE HAYES Okay, if you're gonna take it, this isn't like, oh, I guess, I have to. Taking it is more like this. I'm gonna bring it closer on purpose. I'm gonna be with her, I'm gonna be with her pain because that's part as the flip side of this. So I'm gonna ask you to take this as a symbol of that but I'd like you to take it the way, you take a gift. This part of you, this connection that you have, that you're in for. Is that your enemy? That connection you feel with your daughter, is that your enemy? 

04:04:55
UNKNOWN No. 

04:04:55
STEVE HAYES The connection you, you're in for, an intimate relationship now if this other side means to come with it, could we give it the same kind of care as this? And as a symbol of it I'd ask you to take it, if you want to take it but recognizing you got to take both sides. All right. 

04:05:20
[sil.] 

04:05:25
STEVE HAYES Does it tell you something about what…

Jon Carlson, PsyD, EdD, ABPP 

04:05:30
Paradoxical Intervention 

04:05:30
Challenger (and Miracle Question) 

04:05:30
UNKNOWN … turned on that person now at that time and it actually gets… 

04:05:35
JON CARLSON So how does that work for you guys? 

04:05:35
UNKNOWN It doesn't work. 

04:05:40
UNKNOWN It does not work at all. 

04:05:40
JON CARLSON Well, it works in some way though. I mean, we usually do things, that somehow work for us. 

04:05:45
UNKNOWN It's inventive, it's inventing in my part. 

04:05:50
JON CARLSON So how would, what would be different if umm… you know, this problem wasn't there anymore. 

04:05:55
UNKNOWN Like… 

04:06:00
UNKNOWN Umm… this, this problem… 

04:06:00
JON CARLSON No, no, no, I don't mean the one that you're talking about but the way that you dealt with one another. So if you were to wake up in the morning and his anger was gone and your attitude was gone, then what? 

04:06:10
UNKNOWN Things will be very different. 

04:06:10
JON CARLSON How so? 

04:06:15
UNKNOWN Umm… he needs to live with. 

04:06:15
UNKNOWN It would be true. So it's a mutual feeling. It's, it's hard living with somebody. 

04:06:20
JON CARLSON Well, okay, let's so, the advantage of this then is that you live in a struggle, it's always a struggle that you, you don't have with you guys. 

04:06:35
UNKNOWN A lot of times, it's a struggle. 

04:06:35
JON CARLSON So is that's why you do this to keep life interesting? 

04:06:40
UNKNOWN No. 

04:06:40
UNKNOWN No. It's just, it's kept interesting because this happens. 

04:06:45
UNKNOWN I wish, I wish it could all change is what I want. 

04:06:50
JON CARLSON If, if then you have to be close together? 

04:06:55
UNKNOWN What do you mean? 

04:06:55
UNKNOWN Well, if you weren't acting like this, wouldn't you be very close together with one another? 

04:07:00
UNKNOWN We probably would be. 

04:07:00
JON CARLSON Would that be a good thing? 

04:07:05
UNKNOWN It probably would be. 

04:07:05
JON CARLSON Now, have you have that before in your lives? 

04:07:10
UNKNOWN By…
