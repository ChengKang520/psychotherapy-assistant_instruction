WILLIAM E. CROSS  My family could not be here so this is my loving wife, Dawn, and my daughter, Vita(ph), and I think that's me in the middle. And so, they're here inexperienced(ph) as well. I'm here because of village and I'm gonna highlight a few of the friends at Bariston. That's, uh, A.J. Franklin who is on the audience, uh, and Wade Boykin, two bookshelves that I love being between. (laughs) Book, bookins(ph) I should say. Ah, two people who could not be here, that's Beverly Vandiver and Frank Worrell. And again, I sent them my, my, my greetings. And then, all of the people from The Graduate Center, will you please stand and embarrass yourself. Please stand up. (applause)

WILLIAM E. CROSS  Ah, that was mini village while I'm in, in New York City. Obama. What an effect he had on us? 

00:01:20
Reactions... 

00:01:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS  These are some pictures that captured that. 

00:01:25
Around... 

00:01:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS  All over the world. 

00:01:30
The World.. Precious, Simply Precious 

00:01:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS (laughing) Is that great? This is my favorite. 

00:01:40
 Yes, yes. 

00:01:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS  This little guy bring, represents all of us. We, we've been through so much misery and the hope in his eyes are amazing. 

00:01:55

00:01:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS  Where do we go from here? And do I dare to you to make a comment, uh, to, to weigh in on that question. His victory celebrates the progress of a nation and the sym, symbolic defeat of White nationalism. For some, his victory is a shield of denial in which they talk about color blindness and that race doesn't matter. Yet for others, his victory is a platform from which to launch and drive change deep, deep, deep into the soul of a nation that has yet to fully appreciate its multicultural potential. His victory injects a sense of hope and a daunting tasks that lie ahead. Yes we can. I'm not good at reading but I'm gonna mostly read today. So, bear with me. Our movement in plural, movements in plural and our discourses contributed to his victory. We are, we produced, there were 42 percent of, of, of White vote, that voted for Obama. In terms of minorities, it was always over the, over the majority. But there is a, Obama's election beside the, the negative push for Bush and just wanted to get something different, it was also an affirmation of things that we have been doing all our careers. It's a reflection of those kids and now adults who took ethnic studies, women's studies, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender studies. It's a reflection of those persons who experienced and studied Identity Development Models. It's a reflection of since 1965, the explosive growth of new immigrants and communities across, across our nation. It's a reflection of the globalization of hip hop, something that's often understated. I mean, the kids pride did it out of rebellion in the suburbs listening to hip hop and some of them really listened. And as they matured and became a voting age, they were mooed in part by their being, uh, inform(ph) by, uh, a subsection of the society that often silenced. It reflects, if you will, the changes in the main, in, in, mainstream youth culture. And it reflects a, a bit of a victory for us in multicultural education. Believe that and I think, uh, I like to this but I, I predict that the research will show that. So, while I have no research to give you I just think that's what you're gonna find. We didn't know we were doing it, it was piece by piece by piece and all has come together in part in this moment. One of our feature agenda. Well, one of the first things we need to do is to see- 

00:04:40
Identity Research Enigmatic Multicultural Identity Profiles; Obama and the Self-Image of Our Youth; Colorblind Attitudes & Micro-aggressions; Critical Analysis of Hip Hop Identity Critical Analysis of Internalized Oppression Watch out for ideology, romance & keeping it real Native American Predicaments & Identity Intersectionality: Gender, Disability, SES, etc. 

00:04:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS - the extent to which White identity development and with Janet and, and others, Reed Hardiman(ph) had talked about really we can show that the way in which White identity has evolved probably do not stage for, but probably to the sued(ph) or independent stage where people really took seriously that knowledge. That's, that explains in part their voting behavior and we need to have research to confirm that. We also need to interrogate the igne, enigmatic multicultural identity profiles. For me, Obama is a form of multicultural identity but in my conversation with Michelle find, we have said, "You know, there's no one type of multicultural identity." There are some people who are multicultural, they escape to the suburbs and disconnect from their brother in, in the inner city. Are you with me? A little bit of a preacher, I can't hear you say something here, okay. (laughs) Okay. We now need to go beyond the kind of glove thing of called multicultural which it kinda means everything to anything and try to break that down. What kind of multicultural identity, what kind of situation, what kind of perspective on life that we can say we comfortably, that is a multicultural frame of reference. How does, how, who, who amongst that group who, is moved to action? Who continues to remember? Who continues to feel connected? Who continues to struggle? And I don't necessarily mean any radical sense. We're living in a society that, that is very harsh on true radicals, in true progresses. But we found that to elect, uh, Obama was no small event. It was a victory over reaction. It was a victor, a victory over hatred and that still is present. It is amazing how he has reached out time and again in this last three weeks and he got not one single vote in the House of Representatives from the Republicans and that probably will continue. But we know why, they're, they're, they're psycho fonts of the Deep South and it has not changed as yet. But, nonetheless, we can't take for granted just because someone says they're multicultural but they're, they necessarily, uh, are joining with our struggle. And so, that's one agenda item. Uhm, Obama would appear to have a dramatic effect on the youth. We already have some studies talking about the Obama effect. Well, we need to go deeper with that. Uhm, I'm a little suspicious, I think that's, uh, an (inaudible ) that pride will disappear but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the, the, in such a profound effect on some of our youth to see such a role model that, uh, we can find, find a way to take advantage of that. We need to interrogate co, colorblind attitudes and micro-aggressions. You may find that weird for me to put those together. The research so far is very clear. People regardless of race or culture who hold colorblind attitudes tend to be very friendly to hierarchy, they tend to be very friendly to the status quo. And so, there's almost a contradiction. There is part of their rhetoric that suggest that they are open to difference but in some ways their color-blind, uh, attitudes is a mask for a carrying on of the kind of rigid thinking about race, class, gender and, and what have you as before. In a sense, it's not that they're necessarily being contrive or phony but it's a, almost a desperate way to say, "You know, I don't know if I have time for this. I don't know if I can, can deal with this. So, I'm just gonna threw that away which I think I'm color-blind." And then, and that becomes the end of their analysis. That is tied I think very directly to micro-aggressions because in a sense, in a sense of denial, that's will I tend to think of color-blind as denial. That means they, they will not examine their behaviors and they are likely to participate in predicaments which when people of color or the stranger comes into it is likely to resolve in micro-aggressions. Are you with me? Okay. So, in a sense we need to know and study colorblind attitudes but its relationship to the commitment of micro-aggressions where the issue isn't so much intent but trying to figure out ways to get people to delve the higher level of consciousness and move away from such a blunt and simplistic and, and ultimately stupid, uh, attitude about race and culture. (laughing) We need to pursue and, and we're doing this but we need to pursue a critical analysis of hip hop identity. Ah, I'm old enough to know of, of trends and, and whether there's afrocentricity, whether it's, it's, it's a sense of blackness. All these kinds of notions which start out very sincerely. They're idealistic, uhm, they promised the world and yet it turns out they're, the, one has to be critical, uh, about these friends with reference. So, I'm not being negative about rap or hip hop. I'm not being negative about blackness but I've lived through some of these movements and when they are under theorized, when they are under interrogated, they became, becomes if not dangerous they can become misleading. But not everybod, everything said by the oppressed is something that we should worship. Okay. It, it is true that they know their predicament better than you and I but it's also true they are subjects to some of the internalized racism as you and I are in our own way. And so, we need to move from, uh, whether or not we are, uh, in struggle with those who are, uh, in a, in a pre, pre-difficult situation. I didn't know if I had ma, I had, I didn't know I'd move that, that thing too far. Okay, here we are. (laugh) Uhm, uh, uh, and we also need to figure out what part of hip hop movement has, has participated in the more progressive trends that are occurring not only in the United States because hip hop is moved to China, to Japan, to Germany and so on. There was this kind of backwards but here we go. Okay. Believe it or not that the first thing I should have said to you is that, uh, with Obama's election it simply redefines the notion of diunitalism. Now, what the hell is that? It's either or both end in a sense at the same time that he was being elected, uh, most of the man in his cohort, most of the Black men in his cohort, were not so much marching down of Pennsylvania Avenue with their wives celebrating his victory but they were marching in, in, in, in linear fashion in the prison. So, both of those realities were there and that's our agenda for, uh, for the future and, and, uh, it's amazing that I didn't say that in the first place. Okay. Critical analysis of internalized oppression. I would like to see us been, last time on whether or not people who internalized oppression in depth having lower self-esteem and spending more time asking these two questions. Ah, to what, what effect that certain internalized oppressions result in personal damage and sometimes it does not. But also to what ex, extent does internalized oppression result in group damage? And in my latest research in theorizing, I found that, that is a very important distinction. So, I can, I can experience colorism and I even believe that because I have a light skin but I have, somehow, better than someone else who has brown skin and that may actually lead to my having higher self-esteem as a person. Are you with me? And yet it probably, will also mean some damage within my group because to the extent that I may have something to contribute or I has something to learn I will become somewhat strange to my group with that attitude. Cultural mistrust can nec, does not necessarily lead to personal psychological damage but it may cause some of our folk to under utilize, uh, services that they have every right as taxpayers to participate in. Are you with me? And when that occurs, that means a, a critical mass of our people will, will have higher instances of prostate cander, uh, cancer, uh, because of absence of mammograms, higher breast. You, you, you get my sense? If I don't trust certain mainstream institutions, it may not damage me per se although medically eventually it might but it may damage my group and that if too many people agree with me in this kind of estrangement, we, in fact, are not gonna be serviced the way we should be serviced. So, I think it's critical in the future research that we not be afraid to ask questions about internalized depression but we also understand that in some instances of the focus as, as, at my, as my afrocentric friends say is not so much the person but the person in relationship to the group. I want you to watch out for the, uh, conflation of ideology, romance, and keeping it real. (laugh) What are, what are, what the hell do I mean by that? Okay. Joe Trimble gave a wonderful presentation on the first day and he gave us, uh, example after example after example of how some scholars had created myths about various groups. Well, I want you to remember because you're kind of on the other side of the fence is that you create your own myths, myths driven by your own romance about your own group. It is for the best of reasons but it nonetheless can result in this storied information. So, God bless their soul, the Clarkes who were driven by a notion of neutrality of science but who were also determined to find a way to break the, the choke of oppression participate in producing knowledge, which they thought was knowledge, about the psychology of African-American children. And that knowledge was used by the Supreme Court to eliminate, uh, racial segregation. But the fact of the matter is it was a distortion becau, and, and it's, it's a distortion that I probably would, would have participated in myself if I had been living in those times. But I, I have seen it, I lived it, I seen it where people from various advocy, advocacy groups become so enchanted with their own group that they forget about their humanity. I'm working with Michelle and her students, there is nothing wrong about codifying, interrogating evil wherever it occurs and if you are a human being no matter what the group you are capable in some instances of being evil. Are you with me? It is nothing to celebrate about the violence that has occurring in some pa, quarters of the Black, in my community, the Black community, uh, against women. Those, that's not to be silenced. If your identity is grounded, if you are basically secure, should, you should, now I only wanna hear a beautiful, uh, gospel, there should be moments when you should want to hear from my lips, from your lips, these are issues we must address. In no degree of rematch should block you from saying that. Does that mean you put it in on a foghorn and go down the street? Of course not because your audience won't understand it. And for those of you who are young and you're producing, uh, studies and you reached that point where you, the evidence is not quite going the way you wanted to go, do not be tempted to hide it because you may have been, you may have discovered an important discovery which hopefully in the hands of your advisor and the community and you, and you can never escape your community, will tell you no, you found something important. It's not easy to say but we have to say it and most communities were moved forward when they now only have ways to celebrate their history, celebrate their resiliency, celebrate their coping but also come face to face with the evil that they can do to each other. Am I, am I making myself clear? So, watch out for romance. I suppose I should not look at my notes but look what I got up here. Okay. (laughs) 

00:16:10
[sil.] 

00:16:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS  I don't wanna get in to an issue of measuring one oppression versus another. That's just doesn't make sense. We must continue our advocac, advocacy for various groups but I just, I think we should do with, uh, with, not for, with the Native-American community what I think we have done over the last five years with our gay, lesbian, bisexual friends. We have, we had put that discourse on the map, uh, certainly in our, with our community that's something to, that, that their, their issues, their challenge, their, uh, successes have been something that has, has become like water to us. Are you with me? I think we have not paid enough attention to the dilemmas of Native Americans. Ah, I am very happy that in part of Obama's bill is injecting I think it's three or four billion dollars, uh, in, in, in the, in the various communities and that should have a positive effect. But we still don't know, as a community, just how rough their predicament is and I would hope maybe not next year but maybe two years down the line we just have some way to highlight that situation. To be educated, to be informed, to become a little more aggressive, uh, in, in pushing that as an agenda item. And I hope Joe I have said that in a way that is friendly to your agenda. Ah, that doesn't mean that other issues shouldn't be there. That's just one I wanna stress. I just, I just, have found, it's just gets overlooked. Most of all, what's gonna happened now is greater pressure on us to be even more explicitly intersectional in our analysis. Now, in some ways, that was always the case. It always blows my mind when people say, "Well, there is racial identity and now we're having more complex identity." (laugh) Ah, ah, my mother was always complex, my brothers (laughing) and sisters were always complex but they were simplified at the level of oppression but in terms of their lived experience they were always complex. So, I, I have five siblings. I have one who's not, uh, thank God, I have no Republicans but we, (laughing) we, we, you know, I have one sister who was over here who has a really weird notions of who her, her daughter should marry and I, I have my brother, my brother who was, although he's married to a White woman, was about as Black nationalist as you could get. We always used to wonder, "How do you do that?" (laughing) Okay. 

00:18:30
[sil.] 

00:18:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS  But it puts more pressure on us to be more explicitly intersectional and, and to those of us and I, I identify as such, I, I have yet, I have yet other than in a qualitative study seen a very solid operationalization of intersectionality. Most of the time I, I, I hear people say, "Okay, because I can, affix these de, various demographics to a person," then they will say, "that makes that person intersectional." As opposed to, I isolate, if, le, let me use this language, "say 100 or 200 people, who fit that demographic profile and then ask them to act on life, make decisions or look at some of their outcomes. Is it the case that someone who is, in a cert, certain kind of position do they look on life differently? What can we learn from them? Because, in a sense, we're almost using demographics to define intersectionality and I don't think that's what we really mean. I think we mean is it possible for people to be relatively conscious of a number of identity steams, my choice of language, at the same time so that when they look out on life, when they act on life they act and look and feel differently. And I, I don't see that, nonetheless, happening in our research and that's gonna be a big challenge for us because to a certain extent we are stuck with linear models of how to construct scales and how to interpret them and we may have to talk about a new, new, new, uh, kind of statistics, uh, a new kind of methodology. Certainly, it is clear that deep, deep case studies can get started and I'd like to see, uh, I don't, well you put me up on the stage, okay. (laughs) Ah, I would hope that one thing I'd like to see a little bit more in this conference and others is where maybe one or two people have done a deep case study and, uh, or if they have, say, say, if two or three people have done case studies and then they try to figure out how did those use(ph) syncretic case studies of multiculturals and whatever, how do they talk to the, to each other. But first, you go deep into the experience. I went to a session which was gonna be on multiculturalism and counselor and, and internships and so on. It was a great, great session but what I went there for is for people to talk to me about what was it like to be in the room with the client, it was different at 10:00 o'clock and then a different kind of client at 11:00 o'clock. And how did you pull that off? And where did you go to have a drink at 5:00? 

00:21:00
[sil.] 

00:21:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS (laughing) How we doin' in time? Okay. Methodology. I kind of said this already. I don't want just case studies, I love to see theory driven deep structure case studies. 

00:21:20
Self-Concept Studies that Explore PI and RGO as a Matrix [PI-Matrix and RGO-Matrix]; Transactional Analysis & Identity Enactments; The Question of "Outcomes" 

00:21:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS  In my own experience it has been that most profound research starts with profound descriptive studies and that's often, uh, an end of one. And then, that get's joined with other persons who, who focused on either the same population or by design other populations but still very rich description. Now, why do I, when, when we started our studies, uh, of Black identity we didn't know necessarily what we were studying, we had a faith but the old research was incorrect. When we looked at our mothers, and our sisters and we didn't see low self-esteem, and we didn't see people wanted to commit suicide. We said, "Well, you know, something's wrong here." But in our naivety 'coz we weren't trained we said, you know, "Well, how will I get to handle around this?" So, while we were learning our discipline at the same time we said, "Well, let's, let's not quite theorize yet. Let's not quite go with the answers. Let's have, let's have the people talk to us." And it's amazing how, if you take the time to, and sometimes you don't know how it's gonna fit together if you do rich, deep, theory driven case studies in a sense that begins to talk back to. Now, this sounds like a little bit of a contradiction because, in a sense, how can be theory driven. Okay. Well, for some of you, put the theory out, okay, because in a sense that, that, you are at that point. But for others of you, uh, when you're, you, you have been imbedded in the theory it's amazing how if you have a starting point it makes it easier for us to move from it or disconfirm it. So, I, I should like, I should say I'd like to see both. Those of you, those of you who are young, who have a hunch about a sub, subpopulation, just describe it as best you can. For those of you who think you know, like myself, sometimes take a deep breath, test your case by, test yourself by going deep with the, with the, uh, with the great description to study. I'd like to see more studies of self-concept, believe it or not, okay, only I'd like to see you do what, where you understand PI and RGO not as a single variable but as a matrix. It is amazing how we hang our life on self-esteem. It drives me cra, crazy, okay. There are a multitude of important personality variables that need to be studied and ha, have not so at the god of, uh, at the alter self-esteem. But likewise, none of us are one social group. I don't know if anybody is one social group. You're, at the same time, you're Black, you're man or woman, you're gay or lesbian, you're disabled, you're from California, you're from New York. Guess what? That's a social identity, too. (laughs) And so, uh, I think we need to have studies of self-concept that are driven by notions of a matrix both with, with regard to personality and with regard to social identity. I have found in the last, uh, 10 years that when I'm talking to folks getting away from identity as variable and ask him this, the question, "How does identity lived on a daily basis?" Not too far remove from case studies. And in our own group we have managed to, uh, buy onto, we got, uh, uh, marry onto, let, attach ourselves to Wade Boykin's notion that mo, (inaudible ), most minority groups have to negotiate three worlds or three sets of predicaments. Discrimination, the mainstream, and then ironically, their own group. None of these things are you born with to, to be able to transact. You have to learn to transact. So, to those of you who know, we've talked about buffering as a description of the psychology of how you negotiate a discriminatory situation. Cult switching for us is the capacity to what? To move in and out from your cult, ethnic culture or whatever you social identity into the mainstream where most power lies, where most jobs are, where most of the money is. I, I, I think we produce a much more dynamic discourse in identity when we find a way to talk about it in terms of transactions. And once you've isolated a notion of transaction, then you can back it up in the psychological sense and then say, "While you were doing that, how, what did you think? What were you thinking? How do you feel? What kinds of actions?" In other words, you can go back to your traditional psychological paradigm of cognitions, ethic(ph), and behavior but you start out and if the (inaudible ) sense, with the, with the whole. And I, I think transactional analysis does that. It also links itself to daily diary studies which you can use a pomp pilots with a, so it can be very confiable but also it went itself to, to, to amazing, uh, uh, qualitative studies as well. So, our focus on transactional analysis for me is, would be important. And then finally, uh, the outcomes. Those of you who read, be carefully, you know that I haven't stopped being a psychologist by, have been frustrated by psychology. I would venture to say that there is some African Americans using my own group as an example who voted for McCain and that if we did a personality analysis of them compared to people who voted for Obama, there would be no differences. There'd be no differences in self-esteem, there'd be no differences on the big five, there'd be no differences on self-enhancement. And that for the most part, personality doesn't get us as an outcome where we wanna go. Instead, we have to get to the more messy part of psychology and that is attitudes, values, frame of reference. Attitudes, values, frame of reference. In a sense it, they were talking about how you lived your life. That's sticky because I can get you into romance that I can get you into deep, deep trouble with regards to valuecism(ph) but I think, I think if you do it as a team and you don't do this on isolated person, you stand the chance of getting closer to the fact, how is it that a particular target group even if it's oppressed through certain degree has multiple ways to find personal happiness? Which is a different question from, how does a group organize itself despite the presence of neuroticism, des, despite the presence of slow self-esteem and, nonetheless, act on its predicaments in the fashion that increases the probability that not only will it sell the problem at the personal level but it will sell the problem at the collective level. Are you with me? That's messier but I find that much more productive and that's why in our own research, we, we make a big deal of going to the Black community, and we have a scale that allows us to do that and God bless Beverly Vandiver(ph) for, for helping us to put together such a robust scale. But we start out with an assimilations identity, with a, uh, afrocentric identity, with a multicultural identity. And time and again, we have found that personality variables don't separate these groups but how they spend their times to the extent to which they engage a culture, to extent to which they try to promote history, the extent to which they try to solve problems. That is predicted by identity. So, if you ask me the question as a cult, multicultural psychologist, there are infinite ways in which you, as an individual, can achieve personal happiness. But if you ask me the question how can you as a multicultural psychologist make a difference in, in groups, that is more constraint. And I think that's been for, for our group the most important con, contribution we tried to make o, over the years.

WILLIAM E. CROSS I, I smile when I look out upon you. I, each of you has participated in my, my development. I'm an adult but sometimes I've been a child and, patting in your hands and I've loved it. And I can feel your caresses at different times, at different times of the day. And I hope my writings have pushed a little light into your hearts, your souls and your minds and I leave you by saying keep it real, my, my expression from the (inaudible ), and, and continue to struggle.
