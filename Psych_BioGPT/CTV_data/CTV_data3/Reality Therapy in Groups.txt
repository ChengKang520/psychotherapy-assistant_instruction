DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Hello. My name is Bob Wubbolding. And in the next two hours, I would like to talk about Reality Therapy applied to group counseling. This tape is intended for beginners, practitioners and teachers, beginners in Reality Therapy, as well as beginners in group counseling, practitioners and teachers in Reality Therapy, as well as in group counseling. My hope is that you will learn some basic ideas about what Reality Therapy is, as well as about how to integrate it into the stages of group counseling. I will first present a summary of the background information which is called Control Theory or Control System Theory as developed by William Glasser, the founder of Reality Therapy. After that, I would like to talk about Reality Therapy itself, more specifically the cycle of counseling which is the Delivery System, the how-to, and within that cycle, I would like to emphasize what is called the WDEP System. It sounds like a radio station and it's easy to remember. It's easy to apply in some senses and it is, ah, also teachable. It can be taught to, ah, ah, counselees. It can be taught to parents. It can be taught to, ah, students. And I will also allude to the stages of group development, the four stages, the initial stage, the transition stage, the working stage and the termination stage. For more information about this I'd suggest several sources, certainly Glasser's books "Reality Therapy and Control Theory" and more recently his book called "The Quality School." And as you might expect, I would recommend several books that I wrote, one is called "Using Reality Therapy" and one is called "Understanding Reality Therapy," which was just published. The stages of group development are based on the stages as formulated by Jerry Corey. And an excellent source for information on the four stages of group development is his book called, "Theory and Practice of Group Counseling". Ah, as I discuss this, I will use ideas taken from that source.

DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  To begin with, I'd like to talk about what is Control Theory or Control System Theory as it applies to group counseling. And I'd like to ask you, "Why do people come for group counseling?" Does anybody have an idea about that? "Why do people enter a group counseling session?" Yeah. 

00:03:05
 They need help. 

00:03:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING They need help. And one of the things that they need help and that is most obvious is their behavior. And so, I put a crude outline on the board here and I'd like to allude to it as I go through this. When people come for counseling, they come because of the most noticeable, most observable part of their lives are sometimes not in, in kilter or sometimes out of balance. Something is not working the way they want it to work or something is not working the way somebody else thinks it should work. For example, a, an, a group of chemically-dependent people is often present because somebody else thought that their lives weren't working right, so they almost coerced them or, let's say, put pressure on them to enter group counseling. So, they enter group counseling because of behavior. And behavior is divided into four elements or four levels. The first one is action. Okay? When you walk in the door tonight, you did something. You, you generated an activity, which we call walking. Right now, you're sitting. That's action or activity. A second part of it is thinking. We generate thoughts. When you walked in the door, you generated some thoughts. You said, "Here I am. I'm in the right place and now I'm going to walk in and I'm going to get something to eat and I'm gonna sit down or whatever." All those, ah, ah, thoughts went through your minds probably or some similar thoughts. So, thinking always accompanies action. Feelings also accompany action and thoughts. When you came in, you found the right place, you felt better. Ah, perhaps, there was a little anxiety about getting here since this is a different place for you. So, you, you felt a little uncomfort, a little discomfort. And you walked in, you felt comfortable. So there's a, there was a change in feelings. Your feelings accompanied the other two components. The fourth level is physiology. Physiology. Many people come for counseling because of physiology. Ah, perhaps, they have continuing headaches, continuing backaches and that that, the physicians can't find nothing wrong with them, so they say, "You better go for counseling. We can't find anything wrong with you. It must be all in your head." You have, you have that expression. "The pain is all in your head." Well, all pain is in your head, in a sense. I mean, if we didn't have a head, we wouldn't have anything, right? So, so all of our pain is, is in our head. All of our behavior comes from our, our thinking, from our, our thoughts and from our, our behavioral system. So when people have difficulties, it's usually in one or more of these levels. However, it could be primarily in one or more of the levels. For example, ah, a group of students comes for counseling oftentimes, ah, referred because they're flunking in school. That's an action. That's an activity. Somebody else may come for counseling because they, they have a lot of negative thoughts. Nothing is going right, you know, the, the eternal pessimist. Ah, the, this person comes for counseling frequently and can be in a group, ah, extreme negative thinking we call psychosis. And people sometimes, ah, ah, live not just, ah, with a, an occasional crazy thought, which we all have, but they live with habitually crazy thoughts and sometimes they are referred to groups. They enter mental hospitals and they have group therapy. So, those are thinking disturbances. As I say, all of behaviors are present but that's the one that's primary. Some people come for counseling because of feelings, maybe they're depressed, maybe they're anxious, maybe they're fearful, maybe they're agoraphobic, maybe they're, they have, ah, fears of, of high places or those, ah, of, of photophobia. I believe that's the one that's called, ah, ah, footnotes, phobophobia, ah, fear of getting a phobia. So, I haven't met too many people like that but, ah, the, the, it's a reason that people may come for counseling. They're afraid of something. Usually, what, ah, the, the fears are less dramatic than that, that prompts us to, to, to do counseling with somebody. So, so, those are some problems that people had. And as I said, some people come for counseling re, for their physical problems. Now, in counseling, we don't necessarily treat the physical problems. This is, of course, an area for the medical profession but, ah, these, these physical aches and pains sometimes accompany our behavior. This behavior that we generate can be, ah, especially in the examples I've given, ah, on the left side of this chart, which would be negative. It would be kinda failure behavior, not moral failure or character failure or anything like that, but we're feeling failure when we come for counseling in those areas. It could also be ah, called ineffective out-of-control behavior, ah, irresponsible behavior, some of, those are some of the words that we've used in Reality Therapy over the years to describe the be, this behavior which I think is most accurately called ineffective behavior or less effective behavior, giving up, getting involved in negative actions, negative thinking, negative, ah, feelings and so on. On the other hand, what we're trying to do in counseling is get somebody from this side of the chart to this side to where they are motivated to change. Instead of giving up over here, they say, "Yes, I'll do it. I'll change. I want to improve. I want to make a turnaround." They then get involved in some positive behaviors, positive symptoms, becoming assertive, becoming altruistic, developing some positive feelings of sociability, of trust, of patience. They develop some, some more positive thinking behaviors where they look at the bright side of things. For instance, instead of the negative, where the think rationally and can reason things out and, and the delay gratification, for example. Those would be some of the thinking behaviors that we'd be work, we would be working on. And in counseling, people develop some physiological behaviors that we would call more effective, getting exercise, taking care of their health and so on. So, we're trying to help people go from this side to this side. Now, where does this behavior come from? Where does it come from? Well, we have expressions in our society that illustrate where we think our behavior comes from. We have expressions like, "He made me do it." There's an old song, "You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when the skies are gray." Remember singing that at camp? Well, when I was a kid, we'd sang it at camp. More than a few years ago. But it in, it in, illustrates that our behavior is coming from the outside, but if we accept the principles of Control Theory or Control System Theory, what we teach here is that our behavior comes from the inside. And so the arrow, from behavior to the world, is the correct way to draw that arrow. To draw the other way, to say that our behavior is caused by the external simu, stimuli is the reverse of what we teach in Control Theory and in Reality Therapy. We say that it comes from within and it is directed toward the world outside of us. So when someone says, "You made me do it, or "I had an anxiety attack," or "A fit of depression came over me," well, there's a purpose behind that but we say that that is a little inaccurate as far as des, ah, describing where the behavior came from. What we teach here, what we accept and what we use in our group counseling is that the behavior came from inside of us. It came from five sources, which we teach in Reality Therapy, are born in us, five drives. And you can use these components as you do group counseling. You can kind of use it almost as a diagnostic schema and review it with the people that we're talking to and say to them, now what are you, what's missing in these areas? What's missing in your sense of belonging? Your sense of belonging, your sense of involvement with people, okay? A lot of people feel loneliness and feel separateness and feel isolated and in, and in group counseling, the idea is to help them figure out how to cure that, how to, how to get involved with people. This is not complicated. The, the cure for loneliness is what? 

00:11:10
  Feeling important? 

00:11:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Involvement with people. It's like saying the same thing twice. W.C. Fields once said the only cure for insomnia is to get more sleep. Well, the only cure for, ah, loneliness is to be involved with people, same idea. So, I like to say that there's three kinds of belonging: social belonging, work belonging and friends belong, ah, and, and family belonging. Those are areas of our lives where we need to work out a sense of belonging. And in group counseling, you experience people who lack some sense of belonging often at home. They may come from abusive homes, they may come from a, ah, or, ah, ah, a divorce, they maybe rejected by, ah, an employer in the sense of, ah, they're terminated and the person feels not just, ah, that their survival is threatened but that they feel rejected so, so they come for group counseling or individual counseling. Second need is the need for power, the need for power. It comes from a French word pouvoir, which means to be competent, to be good at something, poder in Spanish. It doesn't necessarily mean power over somebody or exploiting somebody. Another word for it, which I won't write up here, but it means, ah, it, it is achievement, competence, the ability to be good at something, to be capable, so when we say power in Reality Therapy, we're using it in that sense. Not to hurt somebody necessarily although people do use their power in that way but it really means to be self-actualized, to be everything we can be to have some effective control in your life. Part of it could be also recognition. People will die for recognition. Napoleon once said he could make men die for a few pieces of ribbon. People will die for recognition. So, so it's a very important drive that we have, competence, confidence, self-worth, recognition, achievement, power. The third drive that we have is the drive for fun or enjoyment. Fun or enjoyment, which is the ability to laugh, to see humor. Aristotle, the philosopher, defined the human being as a creature who is risible. R-i-s-i-b-l-e, that means it can laugh. He had other definitions but that was one of them. In other words, that's what separates us from other critters, the fact that we can laugh, that we can see humor. You could tell your dog a joke when you go home after this session but, yeah, you know, you, in fact, you could curse out your dog, it will still wag its tail and, ah, and, and it seems they have some fun but it's not the same kind of fun that we have. The fourth need is the need for freedom or independence or autonomy, which means the ability to make choices, to move around, to, to stand on our own two feet, to control our impulses. All of those ideas are related to freedom, related to choice. The last need is our need for survival or our physiological needs, survival: our need for health, our need for air, our need for life, our need for water and so on. And, and, ah, tho, those are the five needs. Now, I'd like to explain those as if they are the legs of a chair. In other words, there should be some balance among them. If you, and, use the analogy of a secretary's chair, the post in the middle is the need for survival and the other legs are the four needs that we have. It, it illustrates the idea that there should be some balance among these needs. It's a little bit different than Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. He has different needs and he also says that there is a hierarchy. What we say here is that they, there needs to be some balance among these for a person to be, ah, mentally sound. No one is totally imbalanced, of course. Another way to look at this is these is this, as if they are as, empty salad bowls and we fill them up with our behaviors as we live. And so it's not that we already have them filled, that's what we do with our behaviors as we live our lives, as we try to fill them up. Those are the general motivators or drives from which our behavior springs. But there is also another mechanism, a more specific series of wants which drive us to do things and we call this a mental picture album. That's one phrase for it. A want is the same thing as a picture and these wants are related to all the needs. You have wants related to all five needs. You have a picture related to belonging, you have one related to fun, probably you have hundreds, perhaps thousands of wants. You want to be sitting here in this room tonight. You want also to continue living, okay? So, so you have a lot of wants. You want to wear the clothes that you have on. I want to have the chalk in my hand. Now, some of these wants are more important than others which illustrates another characteristic that I'll get to in a moment. But we call this a mental picture album. In Glasser's more recent work, he is calling it the quality world. Quality world means that we build inside of us a series of wants, all of which have quality for us. None of them has, has any negative value. They all have quality. They're important to us and that's why it's called the quality world because it's like a world you build inside of your head which is a reflection of what you want this to be out here. Now, if you, if we get from this world whatever we want, we exist in a condition, I guess you could call it homeostasis. We got what we want. I want to be standing here, I'm standing here. On the other hand, if I want to be standing there and I'm standing here, my mental scale is slightly out of balance. I'm here and I want to be there. So my scale is out of balance. And so I don't have exactly what I want. So it's like you have, we have in our brain a scale that's slightly out of balance when what we want fall short of what we have. Because of that, we generate behavior, we generate behavior. And so when my scale is out of balance, what do I do to get it back in balance? I generate a behavior to put it back in balance. Use this simple example, the simple example of walking from one place to another as a metaphor for much more complicated behaviors. This behavior of walking from this place to this place was effective. It worked. You would say it's responsible. I'm in control. It's successful. So you would call it a plus. On the other hand, let's say my scale is out of balance and you know many people like whose scale is out of balance, they want to be there and they're standing here. What do they do in order to get there? Well, they may generate some very negative behaviors and they may start to throw things, get angry, get, even do violent, violent behavior, perhaps kill somebody. They may to drink and say, "Well, if I can't get over there and can't be there at least I'm gonna drink, I'm gonna take drugs so I can feel good where I am and I'll just pretend I'm over there." On the other hand, they may, ah, get depressed. Maybe they get, develop aches and pains and be, and, and frustrations. I mean there's no secret to, to say that, uhm, ah, that, that, ah, ulcers and heart attacks and, and strokes are due to stress and strain. The Center for the Study of Disease Control found that over 50 percent of heart attacks are due to the way we live our lives, 37 percent of cancer. By the way, do you know where this Center for the Study of Disease Control is? What? 

00:19:10
 Atlanta. 

00:19:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Atlanta? No. Okay? In other words, a lot of our aches and pains are due to the way we live our lives and, ah, there have been surveys done on physicians and many times they say a high percentage of the reasons that people come to the physician's office are reasons that that physician cannot really treat them for. It's well over 50 percent. And so it's, it's our lifestyle, it's an, ah, ah, an out-of-balance scale in many instances. We're not getting what we want so we generate behaviors even physio, physiological behaviors, certainly some depression, certainly some negative thinking, some destructive thinking and very often some behavior that is, ah, ah, an activity that, that's harmful. And our job is to help people fulfill their needs, put their skills in balance with behaviors that are on this side of the chart. A word about some of the characteristics of this mental picture album. One of the characteristics is that the mental picture album, or the wants within that album are specific. They are not general, the needs are general, wants are specific. "I have a need for power, but I want to be standing here. I have a need for belonging, but I have a want for a relationship with this person". Another characteristic is that they're unique. Every, every one of your needs, the mental picture album is unique. Nobody has a picture album, a quality world, exactly like yours. They're all unique. And, of course, they're influenced by the culture that we, that we, that, that we live in, Western culture, or whatever sub-culture that we're in. Certainly influenced by our sexuality. Ah, we can pro, probably say that, that ah, each person has, has a different want depending on your sexuality, too. So there's a lot of elements that influence and that we choose, ah, relative to this mental picture album. Another characteristic is that some pictures can be blurred. Some pictures can be blurred. Just as in your family album, you may have some pictures where it's not quite clear what you're looking at when you see it. And I will say this, parenthetically, that many people who come from chemically-dependent families, and the chemically-dependent fa, person, him or herself, has oftentimes, not every time, but oftentimes, a mental picture album with blurred pictures. As you grow up and as you are a member of such a family, if one time you get clobbered for a certain behavior, and the next time you get praised, you're not sure what to, to decide to put in your mental picture album. You have contrary wants, very blurred pictures. "I am not sure what I, what I need to do here. I don't know what works, I don't know what's effective." Also, some of the pictures for this person are difficult to prioritize. And your picture albums have probably a very, very clear priority. As you look at a skyline of a city for instance, you'll notice that some buildings are taller than other buildings. You're able to put those buildings in priority. Obviously, the, the opposite of true, is true of many people who have a chemically dependent, dependence problem, or come from such a family. If, when they look out at that skyline, which is the 'wants', each 'want' represented by a building, it may seem that that skyline is pretty much the same. If you come home one day and you get clobbered, you don't know how, you don't know whether that's mo, whether it's more important to come home and do what you did, or to come home the next day and do the opposite. Because one day you, you get a need-fulfilling experience and the next day, a non-need fulfilling experience. We put contrary pictures, blurred pictures and sometimes we put pictures all of whom or all of which are at the same level of priority into our mental picture album. So, I think it's very important to understand and when dealing with some individuals and some groups that it's very crucial that we help them define, prioritize and clarify what is it they want. It's so important that, I think, it's one of the most significant parts of Reality Therapy is to help people define what they want. Emerson once said, "Beware of what you want. In all likelihood, you will get it." So, putting the idea in your head is a powerful, powerful influence and a powerful, powerful motivator to define what is it we want, precisely. There's one more component of this Control System that I would like to discuss and that is what is called perception. And I'd like that you, to explain it by illustrating what happened to you tonight when you walked into the room. When you walked into this room this evening what you did is you looked at the chairs. And what did you say about the chairs when you walked in? Well, you're looking at me like, "What are you talking about?" You didn't say anything because you just looked at the chairs and said, "Chairs." In other words, you did not make a lot of judgments about the chairs. You recognized them as chairs. So you saw the chairs from what we call a low level of perception or a recognizing level of perception. You knew that they were chairs. You didn't say, "Now, aren't those wonderful chairs? I wonder if I could buy one of those chairs and take it home with me? Those are the, those are the most comfortable and most attractive chairs I've ever seen!" If you have acted that way and if you have said that, I would've said, as my father used to tell me when I was a kid, "The man in the white coat is going to take you away." All right? So, you just said they're chairs, you labeled them. On the other hand, if you were to go home and you have a favorite chair, it's the chair that you have in, in your home and it's a, it's a family heirloom, and you have fond memories as a child, ah, of sitting in, on your parents' lap and grandparents and so on, and the chair's, you know, 75 years old. Well, that's a very special chair to you. When you go home and you look at that from a high level of perception, high level of perception, and you say my favorite chair. And you would not want to part with that chair. And if you came home some night and the, the chair had been set out at the curb for the, ah, trash people to take it away, you would probably be a little annoyed. Because it isn't any chair, it's your special chair. You look at it from a high-level of perception, positive. You put a very positive value on it. On the other hand, if you went through the State Penitentiary and you saw a chair there, rather uncomfortable chair, with straps and wires and a little hat, what might you say about that chair? "My favorite chair. I can't wait to try it out." No, you, probably, you would say that, "This is a very negative chair." It has a negative, ah, ah, ah, feel for you and you don't want any part of it. So, the high level of perception could be positive, negative or you could put a neutral value on it, as it comes through that filter. But the one that I'm concerned about most and want to emphasize is the positive or negative, ah, value that we put on the world around us. So important is the perception that it is like the umpire in a baseball game. The story is told about a baseball pitcher who threw the pitch in, a very impatient pitcher. And he was in a game with a, ah, ah, an umpire who was hesitant, slow in calling the strikes and balls. So the pitcher threw the pitch in and the umpire hesitated. The pitcher says, "What is it, a ball or a strike?" The umpire says, "It ain't nothin' 'til I calls it somethin'." And that's what our perception is. It's what makes the reality. Your perception is the, the, the umpire. It makes this room hot or cold, doesn't it? Is the room hot or cold? Well, depends on, on, on, ah, you know, what your perception is. And your perception depends on your experience. It depends on your behavior. If you are, if you come into the room from zero-degree weather, you say, "Oh, it's nice to be in a warm room." On the other hand, if you're can, coming in from the, ah, ah, Saudi Arabian desert, you walk into this room, what do you say? "Oh, it's nice to be in a cool room." So, it depends on your behavior, your experience as to how we look at things. Getting back to the perception, do you know anybody that see everything from a low level of perception for many things? Like, "You know, it doesn't make any difference, I don't care." The chemically-dependent person frequently says, "I don't drink that much. What's the problem? Everybody else seems to have a problem with what I'm doing." This, the kid is flunking in school, "What's the problem, you know, who cares? So I'm flunking six subjects, well, I don't care, what, what's the difference?" "Do you wanna pass?" "Well, I don't know. Who cares?" Well, that person is seeing things in the low level of perception. On the other hand, do you know anybody who sees things from a high level of perception? Everything is a big deal. "I want what I want, when I want it and by God, if I don't get it, it's an international incident." Okay? I mean when some people don't have what they want, they figure out how to get it or they do without. Other people when they don't have what they want, what do they do? They call out the National Guard, the CIA, the FBI and it becomes, ah, ah, you know, ah, a cause for, for a warfare. So, so that person sees things from a high level of perception. Another way of seeing things from a high level of perception is that everything is better, everything is good. "I approve of this, I disapprove of that." If you know someone like that, it's possible that after spending a few hours with that individual, you may be very tired because, ah, it, especially if you see things from a low level of perception. If you see things from a low level of perception and you're with someone who is constantly judging everything as, and approving of it, after a while, it becomes very difficult for some people. So our job in counseling individuals and groups is very often to help them lower their level of perception. And sometimes our job is to help them raise their level of perception. I like to say this, that sometimes our job is to comfort the inflicted. When somebody's upset about something or they're out of control, we want to help them lower their level of perception. On the other hand, if someone sees everything from a high level of perception, a parent sees their kid as being absolutely no good and so on, our job then is not to comfort the inflicted, but our job is to sometimes afflict the comfortable. If somebody's too comfortable in the problem, we want to help them get their scales out of balance, change their level of perception. Okay. That is a summary of the Control Theory or the Control System Theory, which is the background to Reality Therapy. I used the words interchangeably sometimes but strictly speaking, there is a difference. And what I have explained up till now is the Control System Theory or the Control Theory. In summary, it is made up of these elements. The first element is needs, wants and scales. Needs, wants and scales. Can you say it together? Needs, wants, scales. (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
 Needs, wants, and scales. 

00:30:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Okay. The second element is behavior. What's the second element? 

00:30:30
 Behavior. 

00:30:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And the third element is perception. 

00:30:35
 Perception. 

00:30:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And the fourth element is on the board, but it's a component I have not mentioned up till now and that is the world outside of you. Oh yes. What's the fourth element? 

00:30:50
 The world outside of you. 

00:30:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Once again. Say that like you mean it. 

00:30:50
 The world outside of you. 

00:30:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, good. Now when people are in counseling what do they think ought to the change? 

00:31:00
 The world outside of you. (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:31:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Very good. That's it, exactly. Of all those components, what's the hardest to change? 

00:31:05
  The world... (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING The world outside of you. (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
 ..outside of you. 

00:31:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING It's hard enough to change our wants, our perceptions, our behaviors. It's very difficult to do that, but it's possible, but we can do all that. But to change the world outside of you is very difficult. If you've been married longer than one day, you know the difficulty of changing that other person. And that person cares about you! How much more difficult it is to change other people, ah, who perhaps aren't interested in changing? Okay, I wanna add one more thing. Because we're going to talk a little bit more about behavior. And I wanna add another idea, because it is so important and I, it's a way to think about this behavioral component. And I wanna use two analogies. One of them is the behavioral suitcase. I'd like you to think about it as a suitcase. And the handle of the suitcase is where? On the action. The idea is if we change what we do, we will change all the other components. Maggie Kuhn, whom you may have heard of, is the founder of the Gray Panthers once said that, "In the morning when I wake up, my arthritis kills me. But I get involved and I forget it." Isn't that interesting? In other words, her feelings and her thoughts and her physiology just took over. But eventually, when she did some things, she got moving, she took that behavioral suitcase by the handle, she changed all of the elements in it. Glasser, who is the founder of Reality Therapy, uses the analogy of the car. And he says that the behavior is like a car and we have control of the front wheels, so the front wheel is doing an, or action and the other wheel is thinking. And we have more control over that than we do the back wheels and we can change the steering wheel. And when we put down or press down on the accelerator, the entire car moves. And so behavior should be seen in that way. 

00:33:10

DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Now, that is a summary of the background information. I'd like to now quickly go to the practical part, the Delivery System, what we do when we do Reality Therapy. And in order to do this, I'm going to erase the board and make another chart. Very quickly. 

00:33:40
[sil.] 

00:33:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Reality Therapy formerly had eight steps and William Glasser, a few years ago, changed this to two major components called environment and procedures. Environment means setting an atmosphere that's conducive to counseling, a friendly but firm atmosphere. Built on that environment are the procedures. Now what I have done is try to present this in a way that is easy to remember and easy to get a grasp on. And the way I have tried to explain this is with two rectangles. One of them being environment and one being procedures. And I'd like to just discuss environment for a few minutes. I won't be able to go into great detail, but I'd like to give an overview of this. Environment means to, to avoid some things and to do some things, some things not to do. Some of these are fairly, ah, common in most counseling theories, but there may be one or the other that is unique to Reality Therapy. And I'll present them in a way that I believe is easy to remember because it starts with A, B, C, D, E. And the, ah, the A is, don't argue, don't argue. When we argue with somebody, what we do is usually create a situation where they can choose to be resistant. And they can choose this very easily because we're fighting them. There is a saying, "Somebody convinced against his or her will is of the same opinion still." In other words, we can clobber somebody into agreeing, but that doesn't mean they're really going to agree. So don't argue. Sometimes, the, the more we argue, the, the more difficult the person becomes. We're not likely to do a lot of that in counseling, but, but we, we could slip into it. The B is don't belittle. Don't put the person down. Again, we're not likely to do a lot of belittling, but as you teach this to other people, parents and, or, or teachers or share it with colleagues, this would be a good, ah, point to, to make because oftentimes, when a, a person who functions in, in an authority role sometimes can slip into these ideas of arguing or belittling. And the third one is criticizing, criticizing, which is to suggest that their behavior really is very poor behavior. The idea of criticism is that we don't teach a better way when we criticize. And, ah, in Reality Therapy what we do is to try to help a person figure out a better way. All I will say about that is to ask yourselves, "When you criticized and when I criticized in the past did it work? Did it get anywhere? What happened as a result of it?" Oftentimes, people get hurt feelings and build a little bit more resentfulness when we criticize. Now, there is a phrase called constructive criticism, which is, I, I figured that that's an oxymoron. It's like jumbo shrimp or death benefits. Or, ah, someone said, ah, ah, family vacation is an oxymoron. It's, it's a contradiction in terms. Well, constructive criticism falls into that category. The D is demean, don't demean the person, and that's the same as belittle, but I put a D in there so I can get to the E. And the E is don't ask for excuses. Don't get in, involved in excuses. It's like quicksand. It is, there, there, it, it will just drag us under. And when we ask a person why they messed up their life, what, what he or she is going to say is, "The world did it to me." It's rare that somebody says, "I chose this behavior. I chose to be irresponsible." Ah, there's a, the case of the, ah, psychiatrist who, ah, defended people on the basis of being in, in, insane. And then himself is accused of committing some crime and he claim, he doesn't say, "I chose to do it." Naturally, what he says is, "I, ah, I was insane myself when I did it." And so, it, it's a very widespread phenomenon to say that we're not responsible for our behavior. And when we ask people why they messed up, they usually will say, "I did it because something out there." It's only natural. I do that and, and, you know, ah, sometimes I, I'd probably do a little bit less now that I know Reality Therapy, but, but I, it's hard to say, I, I chose to do this. That's very difficult to say and there, there aren't many people who can do that. But, in Reality Therapy, we try to not be nasty to people and put them down, demean them because they do that, but help them figure out a way to deal better with the behavior, a way to get what they want more effectively. Those are some don'ts. Some dos. Some dos are also A, B and C, D, E, F. A, B here means always be and the C is courteous and calm. Easy to say, difficult to do. Always be courteous. When we counsel and work with people who are upset, sometimes it's very difficult to be courteous. If we work in an alcoholism program and somebody's out of control, or a mental hospital and somebody's out of control, or a student in a school and they're upset, sometimes it's very difficult to be courteous to them, especially when, when we, we, ah, feel that they're doing things to hurt themselves. So, it's sometimes is difficult. It's easy to say here in this room. D means to be determined that we're going to work it out. In one of Glasser's books, he says that this institution, the school, should be a "we will work it out" school, a "we will work it out" institution. Not that we work everything out. The idea is to aim at that. It's a goal. It's a, ah, ah, a hope. Ah, when a team takes the basketball floor, they don't, they, they know they might not win every game, but they say what, when they take the floor? "We're number..." 

00:39:45
 One. 

00:39:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING They don't take the floor and say, "We're number two!" "We might win!" No, they say, "We will win." So it's a goal, it's a cheer, that's why I don't want to emphasize it too much, but I mean it is the idea that we're going to work things out. E means to be enthusiastic which means look for the bright side of things. It doesn't mean to be a backslapper necessarily, but it means look for the bright side. Ah, ah, if someone says, yes, I'll put in, in a little bit of effort. Instead of saying, well, that's not enough; we can, we can say, well, how much is a little bit? And what will you do when you say a little bit? What specifically will you do? It means look for the bright side. Look for the positive side. Thomas Edison once said that if we leave our children nothing but enthusiasm, we will have left them a legacy of incalculable value. Incalculable value, and he was not a cheerleader. He was really, I mean, I mean in a sense of, of just cheering. He was actually playing the game, and a man who is very practical. So, so, ah, I think it's a rather important idea to look for something positive. That means to be firm and fair and to put the rules and regulation into practice, which we have. That's one of the dos. Another do is to do the unexpected. Do the unexpected. When a person is expecting you to criticize, find something positive. When a person is expecting you to respond to their, ah, unwillingness re, the idea is to respond to whatever part of them is willing to do something. For example, if I were to say to say to Tammy, ah, how much energy do you want to put into working out your, your situation whatever it is? What might you say? 

00:41:25
 (inaudible ). Well, a little bit? 

00:41:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING A little bit? And then I could say, well how much on a scale of one to a hundred? 

00:41:35
 Maybe two hours a day. 

00:41:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Two hours a day on a scale of, well, say percentages. How much a percentage would you say that is? 

00:41:40
 I'd say, 40 percent. 

00:41:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Okay, what are you expecting me to say to her, if I'm counseling her? 

00:41:50
 (inaudible ). 

00:41:54
  Only 40 percent? 

00:41:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Only 40 percent? Okay, say that again. How much of your energy do you think you'll put into this? 

00:42:00
 Hmm, about 40 percent. 

00:42:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  That much? 

00:42:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:42:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING What would you be doing tonight if you were to be working on this situation 40 percent? Okay, you don't have to answer that, but the idea is define, if she just said five percent, I would said, that much? Hmm. Okay. So that's an example, not the only example, but I'm trying to illustrate this in a practical way by way of illustrating a technique for doing the unexpected. Another, ah, do, is to know and employ and put into practice the codes of ethics of the professional organizations by establishing what are the boundaries of confidentiality. By establishing what you can do and can't do. What are the, what are the possibilities of counseling? In many states now it is required to have a statement of professional disclosure to tell people what we can do and what we can't do. And so that's part of establishing the environment. There are other elements of this, but I, I really want to move on to the heart of the practice and the heart of the, ah, method here which is the procedures. The procedures now are summarized in four letters that I'm going to the, to write here. W, D, E, P. It sounds like a radio station and I tried to summarize these ideas into this, these call letters to illustrate of, ah, how they can be used and to illustrate that they can be taught to people. The W stands for asking the clients, what do you want? What is it you want? For example, what is it you want from your parents? What do you want from your friends? What do you want from your job? What do you want from your supervisor? What do you want from yourself? And what do you want from me? What do you want from your church? What do you want from the future? What have I left out? 

00:43:55
 Yourself(ph)? 

00:43:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yourself. Have I left any out? There's about eight or ten categories that we could explore with a person. What do you want? Then we could also explore what is it you want that you're getting. In other words, what scales are in balance? You could also explore what scales are out of balance, what do you want that you're not getting? So you have about eight questions, generic questions, then you add on eight more, what do you want from each of those categories that you're getting, then you add on eight more, what are, what do you want from each of those categories that you're not getting so you got a lot of questions to ask people in group counseling. I may ask frequently how do I start a group, or what do I talk about? Well there's 24 questions you can talk about. Now you can't ask everybody every one of them, but the point is you pick and choose what may be relevant at that moment. That's the W. Part of the W also is to explore how you look at things. What are you, what are your perceptions? How do you see things? So we're exploring all the elements of the Control System. Not only what is it you want, but how do you look at things. Parent, when you look at your child, what do you see? Well, I see a no-good, drug-taking, school-flunking, non-communicating bum. Oh, that's quite a mouthful, quite an eyeful that you perceive, that you see. So it's not exactly the same as asking what is it you want? But it's asking how you look at things. Moving up to the D, this question is what is it you're doing? How are you spending your time? As I said before, the action part of the behavior is the most easily grabbed part of that behavioral suitcase. And so we ask people what is it you're doing? But you could ask what's you're feeling? You could ask what you're thinking? You could ask even about the physiology. But really the heart of it is to try to talk mostly about the action and secondarily about the thinking. But whatever we talk about we should try to link them all together. Avoid talking about feelings, for instance, in isolation from the action. But there is nothing wrong with talking about feelings and sometimes in the beginning, ah, of group counseling it's necessary for people to talk about how they feel, especially at that stage. So the Do, the D stands for asking about all of the behaviors especially the emphasis on the action part. Let me go, give you an illustration. If you were to ask me what did I do today, I'll answer it using two semi-role players, I mean, I'm going to role-play with myself. And so, ah, the first question is, "What did you do this morning?" Okay, suppose I say, "Well I got up about ten o'clock." "What did you do then?" "Well then I, I watched television for a couple of hours." "And then, what did you do then?" "Well then I ate lunch." "Did you get dressed?" "Well, no, I sat around in my bathrobe." "What did you do after lunch?" "Well then I, I watched television for a couple of more hours." "What did you do then?" "Well then I took a break." Okay, that's one person. Would you say that person has told you a lot? They told you a lot and they've only descri, described in a few minutes how they spent their day. Okay? Second session, somebody else. "What did you do today?" "I got up at 6:30." "What did you do then?" "Well I ate breakfast." "What did you have for breakfast?" "I had cereal for breakfast." "What did you do after that?" "I did my exercises." "Okay, what did you do after that?" "Well I spent 15 minutes reading something." "What, what did you read?" "Well something that kind of gets me energized and gets me going during the day." "What did you do after that?" "Well I got in the car and I went to work." "What you, what, what, when you got in the car what did you do?" "Well I listened to some tapes on the way to, to work." "What did you do when you got to work?" "Well, I made a list of the things that I need to do today." "Well tell me about the list." "I wrote down the list of things that are most important and I did them first." Okay, what did you learn about that person? Well, you learn that, ah, you're a little crazy too, right? Okay. But the, ah, so you learn something just by going through a segment of the person's day by talking about exactly what happened. So it's a good technique to use to explore the D. The E is in the middle of the chart. And the E is evaluation. It stands for evaluation and it's really the most important part of all this. Because as human beings, you and I have what I sometimes call an undying belief in things that don't work. In other words if they don't do them, do them some more. If you're, for instance, if you're driving, if, if you're, uhm, well you want to drive somewhere and you look for your car keys and you can't find them, what do you do? 

00:48:55
 You look for them. 

00:48:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING You look for them right? First you panic and then, then look for them. And do you ever look in the same place 25 times? 

00:49:00
 (inaudible ) 

00:49:03
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Figuring that they'll miraculously appear there after the 24th time? Actually what we're saying to ourselves is, I'm going to continue to do something that's not working, knowing it isn't working. So what we do in Reality Therapy is we like hold a mirror up in front of the person and we say, look in the mirror, tell me what you're doing and tell me is it working for you. Is it getting you what you want? And we have a suggestion. If that ain't workin', stop doing it. I've said to parents, "Do you yell at your kids?" "Yell, yeah, yeah." "How many times have you yelled in the last month?" "Oh, I don't know, maybe 10 times." "Well, let's, like yesterday, how many?" "Well about five times yesterday". "Hmm, so five times, say five times, times si, six days a week 'coz we'll give you Sunday off. Ah, six days a week that's 30 time, a 120 times a month." "Oh, yeah, it's a little more than I thought." "And so, is it working?" "Well no." "Then I got a suggestion, stop doing it." "Okay." Well it's hard for somebody to stop doing something that they know is working. But that's what we do is we say look in the mirror and tell me is what you're doing working for you. Is it getting you where you want to go? Evaluation. There are other kinds of evaluation, one of which is to examine. Is what you want realistic? Is what you want attainable? Well, ah, I want my parents off my back. Okay, I want them to leave me alone. Is it attainable? How realistic is it? How much money do they spend on you every month for room and board and to feed and water you? Okay? Well they may spend, if they're going through this with an adolescent, you may, they may decide maybe it's couple of hundred dollars a month. How realistic is it for somebody to spend that much money on you and not to watch their investment? How realistic is it? So help the person evaluate what is it you want? The last component is the plan of action. And this is what we aim for. Helping them to make a plan of action. And in a group, the plan can be a group plan, or it can be an individual plan. But it's a plan of action. Now, what are some characteristics of a good plan? As you might expect they also have an acronym for the plan of action. And the suggestion is that it is a SAMIC plan. S, A, M, I, C to the third power over P. Each letter stands for something. Is it a SAMIC plan? Is it simple? KIS, Keep It Simple. Don't make it so complicated they can't do it. A for attainable, realistic perhaps a "just for today" plan. You know what a "just for today" plan? Just for today I'll live through this day only and not tackle the whole problem of life at once. You've heard that philosophy somewhere. Just for today, I'll be a (inaudible ) agreeable, cheerful child and praise before them (inaudible ) criticism even if they cannot but if I find fault, I'll forgive them and forget it. Just for today I will have a plan. I may not follow it exactly but it will save me from worry, hurry and misery. All right. So, a, a just for today plan. Make it attainable. Make it M for measurable. Like "when will you do it?" "Yeah, I'll do it tonight." "Well, what time?" "Well maybe around 8 o'clock." "Well what time will you, will you do that project? "Around 8." "Well, around 8, does that mean 7:30 or 8:30?" "Well, probably, such and such a time." You see, you, you really want to pin them down to a specific time. For example, if you were to call the airline and say, "what time does your flight leave for California?" And they said, "This weekend." What would you say? You would say, "Well could you be a little more precise?" Same way in planning and counseling. A specific measurable plan. I is immediate, like tonight. "What will you do today, tonight, to turn your life around?" "What would you do that's different than you would have done if we do not have this conversation?" So it's an immediate plan. And then they see three Cs, one is consistent which means repetitive. It should be done over and over again. Just for today, but also what about tomorrow? Just for today again. All right? Another, ah, C is controlled by the planner, therefore not dependent on somebody else. But it's controlled by the planner. I'll do this if such and such happened. I used to work at a halfway house for women and they often said, "I'll get a job if the staff wakes me up." Well that's putting the control on somebody else. What would you do no matter what the staff does? A plan controlled by me, the planner. And then the last C is a C which stands for committed to. The plan is committed to, handshake, write it down, check that, use a planning sheet. A lot of ways to get a person to be committed to the plan. All of this is over the common denominator P, this time P stands for perseverance and persistence. Perseverance and persistence. And this means, this means staying with the person, not giving up, hanging in there. It's a quality of us, the counselor. You've heard the story perhaps of the Chinese bamboo tree? Has anybody heard that story? The Chinese farmer plants the bamboo seeds. First year, waters, fertilizers, nothing happens. Second year, third year, fourth year, fifth year. Water and fertilized, the seeds don't even break the soil. The sixth year this, the Chinese bamboo tree, the Moso tree grows 90 feet in six weeks. That illustrates perseverance. It illustrates almost making an act of faith in the work that we do. That it is worthwhile. That, that it is, that it's significant. Ah, I just recently read something by Viktor Frankl and he says, nothing is ever lost, even in, historically nothing is ever lost. All of our works remain and there's a lot of implications in that kind of thought. But it's kind of making, ah, an act of faith almost in our work that it is significant. Because you don't see the results, right? We don't always see the results of the work we do especially in group counseling, or in any counseling in any of the helping professions. But, ah, the P stands for hanging in there, persevering when things are not going so well. That is a summary of the Delivery System. Environment and procedures. The procedures are summarized in the phrase W, D, E, P once doing evaluation and planning. In a few minutes we're going to do a group session, a role-play session, and I'm going to try to integrate these ideas into the stages of groups. And you might watch for the stages of groups. We probably won't go through all the stages. We may only deal with the initial stage. But there are four stages of groups. One is the initial stage. And there are several characteristics and several tasks that I've selected that need to be done in that particular stage. One of them is inclusion. It's important to help people feel included in the session, involved in the session, that this is okay for me to be here. The second task that needs to be done at the in, at the, ah, initial stage of group counseling is that some goals need to be set. In Reality Therapy, we ask every people, what is it you want out of this session? What do you want to accomplish? Also some structuring is a task that we need to do at that stage. That is, here's what I have to offer you as a counselor. Here's what I want from you. Here's, here are some limitations of this group. So we do some structuring. The second stage of group counseling is called transition. At this stage people start to feel some anxiety, they start to wonder well, maybe, this group isn't for me after all, conflict arises, there's a, there's a power struggle that are, that, that occurs. And, and the, the counselor at this stage helps people to define again what is it you want from this session, helps them to define their, their, ah, their behavior in the sense of talking about their feelings and talking about their, their thoughts and talking about their actions. Also, resistance starts to emerge at this stage. There are sometimes a kind of an initial first fervor or first interest in a group and then later there's a little disillusionment and the resistance that takes place. The third stage is the working stage. The important thing about the working stage is that cohesion develop. That is, people feel this group is, ah, is comprised of people that I need, I need their skill. That's called interdependence or cohesion. Also, what happens at this stage is called cognitive restructuring. In Reality Therapy we help people restructure cognitively by asking them evaluation questions. Is this working for you? Is this helping you? Is it getting you what you want? Part of this third stage also is planning. We start to help people make some plans. Plans to implement what they're learning as they go through their, their group session. The fourth stage, the final stage is called termination. And here what is dealt with in this stage is dealing with some lingering feelings, fear of separation, perhaps some guilt at not having worked on all the problems and things that they wanted to work on. Ah, and also dealing with unfinished business. Perhaps they want to say something to somebody. We probably won't get to this stage by the way in the group demonstration. This is a, a, the, the termination stage. We'll actually terminate, but it will be after one session. And finally a part of the, ah, last stage, the termination stage, is carrying the learning further, which is, is, how will you implement this in your life beyond after this group has terminated. Beyond these sessions, how will you implement what you have learned? So, those are the four stages what, that I'll try to be, to, ah, incorporate Reality Therapy into as we do a role-play demonstration. And we'll now take a, a, we'll now set up our group, which we have arranged prior to this time. So, ah, we'll pause now to set that up. 

00:58:40
[sil.] 

00:58:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  This is a role-play and five people have volunteered to role-play individuals who have a common problem. And the, the, ah, only theme that I know about at this stage is that they are out of work. And I know that they'll have other issues to deal with other than that one but ah, we'll get started in just a moment. But I need to emphasize that this is a role-play, which means that ah, they asked them to play as they feel it so I've asked them to refrain from violence. I always insert that as a condition upon which I'll do role-plays. Play it as you feel it and uhm, we'll just see what happens. This is ah, going to be in a mental health center. Ah, the reason I asked it to be a mental health center is that ah, that's a place where many people come with a variety of problems, and many of which would ah, cut across almost every kind of situation in which most of you work ah, alcoholism programs and schools, rehab programs, ah, almost every kind of situation in which your work would be similar to this and that these issues that they're going to deal with would be fairly common and would reflect some of the same content that everyone deals with. So ah, with that we'll get started and, ah, I'll just, ah, start by saying I'm glad you could come to this session. I talked to you all individually on the telephone. And, ah, here you are at the Happy Hours Counseling Service. And, ah, our job is to try to figure out of a way to, to, to deal with these things and, ah, see what help I can be to you. I've already explained all the professional issues of ethics and confidentiality and everything so there's no need to review that again. And my question is, ah, what do you think about being here? 

01:00:30
[sil.] 

01:00:30
THERESA  I don't know. So many people have told me to come, come, come, come. And I'm not sure about being here. I don't see where it's really gonna help me. 

01:00:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. But you made it today. Anybody else feel the same way Theresa feels? 

01:00:50
LORIE Well, I agree with her. I'm here because my husband wants me to be here. And that's the only reason I am here. 

01:00:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Okay. So. (crosstalk) 

01:01:00
LINDA I came, uhm, excuse me, I came hopefully to get some direction and hopefully find a job, (inaudible ) making employable. 

01:01:08
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm, Uh hmm uh hmm. So you're, you're here ah, to find a job and ah, you're here because ah, somebody told you to be here. 

01:01:15
THERESA Uh hmm. 

01:01:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. 

01:01:15
 Yeah. 

01:01:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Joy, how about you? 

01:01:20
 It's okay to be here. I really would like to find a job. I graduated from college and I can't find anything in my field and... (crosstalk) 

01:01:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:01:25
 ...and I'm, I'm depressed about it. I... (crosstalk) 

01:01:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:01:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING I don't know what to do anymore. 

01:01:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, kinda hopeless? 

01:01:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Very. 

01:01:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  It's not fun to be out of work, that's for sure. 

01:01:35
 Especially when you, you've... (crosstalk) 

01:01:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:01:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Gotten to college for four years and you think you're gonna get out and make some money and live like a real person does. (crosstalk) 

01:01:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:01:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And here I am and nothing has happened. 

01:01:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, Okay. 

01:01:50
TOM That's unfair. Not fun to be out of money. Being out of work is not so bad. 

01:01:55
 Yeah. 

01:01:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING They kinda go together. 

01:01:55
TOM  Yeah, well. 

01:02:00
 Yes, definitely. 

01:02:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING So, ah, why are you here, Tom? I'm just wondering (inaudible ) (crosstalk). 

01:02:06
TOM Well, I'm not... (crosstalk) 

01:02:06

01:07:15
TOM I mean I wanna know it upfront. 

01:07:15
LORIE Yeah. I think I'd be willing to put something in, but I don't know, you know, everything maybe as a little strong at this point. (crosstalk) 

01:07:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah, hmm. Your, ah, your expectation is just a little different. You're not interested in a job. Is that right, Lorie? 

01:07:30
LORIE That's, that's right. It's my husband that wants me...

DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:07:35
LORIE ...to get a job. (crosstalk) 

01:07:35

DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm, uh hmm. So you want, you, whatever it is you're, ah, ah, am I getting, am I, are, are you saying that there is, ah, that you're willing to work hard at this?

01:08:00
JOY Yeah. I, I feel like I've done a lot as you've said. (crosstalk)

JOY I mean I've sent out resumes and I've gone on interviews and I just haven't gotten anything. No, nobody has hired me. (crosstalk) 

01:08:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hmm. 

01:08:10
JOY I've done everything that they told me I needed to do. 

01:08:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Must be frustrating. 

01:08:15
JOY Very frustrating. 

01:08:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. So is this, ah, I mean, just your observation, is it your observation, Joy, that this is a, a pretty highly committed group? 

01:08:20
JOY  Yes. 

01:08:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And you really wanna work at it? 

01:08:25

TOM And she's trying to get out of work. 

01:08:56
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. Well, why don't you ask her that, ah, that ah, it would be good to ask her if that's what you wanna know.

01:09:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. Well, I heard you ask the group. I'm just saying maybe you ask her. 

01:09:15
TOM How do you fit into our group? I mean, we all want work and, and you don't. I mean. 

01:09:20
LORIE Well, my husband says that I should want to work and, and that there is something wrong with me because I don't want to work and that if, that if I was right, everything was right with me, then I would want to work. 

01:09:35
THERESA Uh hmm. Well, I was contented for 20 years at home. This isn't a choice of wanting work. I have to. I'd rather be home too. 

01:09:45
LINDA And same with me. I'd rather be home with the kids. (crosstalk) 

01:09:50

01:10:05
 Okay. 

01:10:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And, uhm, are you saying, ah, Lorie, that you're, you're going to look for a job? I'm still not clear about that. You're going to look for a job, or, or you're, you're going to try to convince your husband, ah, to let you alone? 

01:10:15
LORIE  Well, I was at this job that I didn't like very well... (crosstalk) 

01:10:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:10:20
LORIE  For two and a half years. And I stayed there and I worked hard. And, and all of a sudden, I just, it didn't work out. And so I went home. And it's not bad there. (crosstalk) 

01:10:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hmm. 

01:10:35
LORIE I, I kind of like it and, and I wanna stay there. And my husband wants me to go out again, find some work so I'm not. (crosstalk) 

01:10:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING So what will you do? 

01:10:40
LORIE  Well, I suppose I'm gonna have to go out and do it because he's not always gonna stay off my back there so. (crosstalk) 

01:10:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING I'm not trying to say you ought to do one or the other. I'm just trying to clarify, you know, what you want to accomplish here. 

01:10:55
LORIE  Well, it, it does get boring at home... (crosstalk) 

01:11:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm.

01:15:00
TOM It's, it's, it's just, it's not my fault. 

01:15:05
LORIE And you can't put out applications until you know exactly what you wanna do, you know? You, you have to know exactly what it is that you want. Well, there's no point in even trying things. 

01:15:15
JOY But I know what I want and I haven't gotten anything. I mean I worked four years to get a degree so that I could get what I wanted. And now that I'm out there, nobody wants me. 

01:15:25
 And I'll take anything. But it has to pay enough to meet the bills. 

01:15:30
LINDA Right. 

01:15:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Now, ah, having made a total of 13 contacts, I'd like to do a little bit more about that. And I'd like to ask Joy if, if you continue to make this many contacts and no more, where will that get you? And where do you think the group will get if collectively we make 13 contacts in a week? 

01:16:05
JOY Not very far. 

01:16:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. What do you think, Linda? 

01:16:10
LINDA I don't think we'd get very far. 

01:16:10
LORIE  Well, you know you can't do it until you know what you want. 

01:16:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. Uh hmm. 

01:16:20
TOM  I wouldn't get any work done if I made 13 contacts a week. 

01:16:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. Okay. How many, how much time does it take to make a contact for you, Theresa? 

01:16:30
THERESA Ah, not very long 'coz I don't know anything about resumes. (crosstalk) 

01:16:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:16:35
THERESA I just go in and fill out applications. I couldn't, you, you know. 

01:16:40
 Yeah. 

01:16:40
THERESA If I read in the newspaper then I'll call. I'll go over and whatever. 

01:16:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING How long, when you make that call, how long does it take? 

01:16:45
THERESA Oh, the call? Oh, that's just a couple of minutes. 

01:16:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:16:45
THERESA You know. 

01:16:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Okay. 

01:16:50
THERESA 'Coz they never tell you anything on the phone. 

01:16:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:16:50
 Yeah. 

01:16:50
LINDA And I have to get a sitter. I don't know about you. 

01:16:55
THERESA Alright(ph). 

01:16:55
LINDA But I've got to get a sitter. And the last week was really hectic for me. 

01:16:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:16:55
LINDA  And I can't, I can't do that one anymore. 

01:17:00
THERESA I can't do that anymore. I have to get friends 'coz I don't have the money to pay a sitter now. (crosstalk) 

01:17:05
LINDA Right. 

01:17:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:17:05
THERESA So it's always, and its they have to be available to do it. I mean I just can't run off without that. 

01:17:05
LINDA  Yeah. 

01:17:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING What, what is it you would like me to say about all of these as your counselor? What is it you'd like me to say or do? 

01:17:20
LINDA  To offer some suggestions in terms of what direction which maybe we should take or some steps we can follow, (crosstalk) 

01:17:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:17:30
LINDA you know? If I, you know there's a light after hearing that, you know, I will be employed, I will be able to support my kids now, I think I'd feel a lot better. 

01:17:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Uh hmm, Uh hmm. 

01:17:40
THERESA Yeah, as a mom 

01:17:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Do you believe that? 

01:17:40
LINDA Yes, I do. 

01:17:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:17:40
LINDA  You know if I was vould be a little bit more of, you know, things will turn out. (crosstalk) 

01:17:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING That a lot of other people believed it and. (crosstalk) 

01:17:45
LINDA Yeah, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:17:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Yeah, okay. 

01:17:50
THERESA I mean, I'm not real comfortable of you being a man anyway. I mean, (crosstalk) 

01:17:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:17:50
THERESA you know, they're trusted one of those before. Uhm, but, uhm, yeah, I'm 42 and I think that I can do something. 

01:18:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Uh hmm. 

01:18:05
THERESA And, uhm, I came here. There ought to be something, just talking to people. And maybe some of the women here could help me more, some ideas, something we can do that, that pays. I mean my husband wasn't any smarter than me and his job paid money. 

01:18:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Okay. 

01:18:20
JOY Uh hmm. 

01:18:20
LINDA I don't know because I'm still working things out myself, you know? If I, I just know because of the desperate situation I'm in, I, I've got to find something, you know, I don't know. I just want something now. 

01:18:35
LORIE Yeah. Uh hmm. 

01:18:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. Now, my question is the same that I wanna, that I asked before. I wanna ask it again. Ah, how much energy do you wanna put in to finding work and to satisfying yourself, you know, as far as, as getting some, some better feelings about out of life because you're, one other thing, another thing everybody has in common is you're not too excited about life. 

01:18:55
THERESA Uhm, no. 

01:18:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  I mean, ah, that's pretty obvious. 

01:19:00
JOY It's just been really hard. (crosstalk) 

01:19:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Frustration and, and almost, ah, you know, feeling down in the dumps about all of these. Is that true? 

01:19:05
JOY I mean, yeah. 

01:19:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Down in the dumps, (crosstalk) 

01:19:05
JOY Yeah. 

01:19:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  dumps, dumps? 

01:19:10
LORIE Yeah. Uh hmm. 

01:19:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Now, how hard do you wanna work at crawling out of the dumps? 

01:19:10
JOY  We gotta get out. I mean I, I'll work as far as I need to 'cause this sure isn't any fun, like, you know, I don't wanna do anything else. 

01:19:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:19:20
LINDA  I think my need is more than my want. Uhm, I'd, I wanna stay home... (crosstalk) 

01:19:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Yeah, yeah. 

01:19:30
LINDA ...to be with my kids... (crosstalk) 

01:19:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sure. 

01:19:30
LINDA ...but I need to get out. 

01:19:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:19:30
LINDA ...to be employed. 

01:19:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. Well, ideally it would be great to stay home. There is no question. 

01:19:35
LINDA Yeah. 

01:19:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING I mean I'm not, certainly not going to argue that. But you all said you wanted to get some work. 

01:19:40
LINDA Uh hmm. 

01:19:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And collectively a total of, ah, 13 contacts have been made. Now, do you see any connection between wanting work and 13 contacts? 

01:19:55
LINDA Didn't seem like we tried very hard. 

01:19:55
LORIE  Well, you did most of the work anyway. You'd, you had 10. 

01:20:00
JOY Uh hmm. 

01:20:00
LINDA But as I said, I probably won't be able to do that this week and maybe one or two. (crosstalk) 

01:20:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, that's right. I'm thinking of the next week. Now, if, if collectively in the next week, one or two people make one or two contacts, will that bring you closer or further away from getting a job? What do you think? 

01:20:20
JOY It won't be very helpful. I mean it would be kinda helpful but not as helpful as working harder than that. 

01:20:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:20:30
THERESA I don't know. I, I know what you're saying. But it, it, it's like that, ah, I don't know, that, uhm, I should be doing more. And I thought I was doing... (crosstalk) 

01:20:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:20:40
THERESA ...the best I could, getting sitters and calling the paper. And I mean it's just so discouraging. (crosstalk) 

01:20:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. Uh hmm. 

01:20:45
THERESA I mean after you hear "No, no, no, you are not qualified, or yeah, sure, 4.50 an hour." 

01:20:50
LORIE It seems awfully simple too. I mean it's you have to know where you want to make the contacts and, and, and what's the best direction. You don't wanna get thrust out there in something you don't like or... (crosstalk) 

01:21:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:21:05
LORIE ...you don't want. 

01:21:05
THERESA Well, I don't care about liking so much, just, it just got to pay, you know? 

01:21:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. You know, well, I, I wanna to get back to that, Theresa, in a, in a few minutes if, if we can. But my, my question to you is, is, is really it seems like to me that you got two directions you can go in as a group and as individuals. One or two, one or the other of these directions. You can continue to go in the same direction you're going in, making collectively 13 contacts and individually maybe one or no contacts. Or you can go in another direction and change that. And I'm not saying you're not working hard like Theresa's working plenty hard at this. I'm not saying that. You're not. I'm just saying you got two directions, to do what you're doing now or to change it. Now, my question is do you wanna continue to do what you're doing now and therefa, thereby continue your frustration and depression and down in the dumpsite(ph) that we're all doing here. Or do you wanna get out of the dumps and do you wanna try some different things? Which pathway? This one is the same and this one is a different. It's different. 

01:22:15
THERESA I want that. (crosstalk) 

01:22:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Which one is it? 

01:22:15
THERESA  Yeah, I want that. That's different. 

01:22:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING This one? 

01:22:20
JOY This one. 

01:22:20
LINDA No, this one. 

01:22:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING This one. Get out, (crosstalk) 

01:22:20
JOY Yeah. 

01:22:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Out of the dumps. 

01:22:25
JOY Yeah. It's terrible. 

01:22:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING All right. Now, my question is this. If you continue to do what you've been doing next week, in other words, if you do what you did last week, next week, where will you be when we come back here a week from now? 

01:22:40
THERESA Same place, same (inaudible ) 

01:22:44
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING You'll be, you'll be still in the dumps. 

01:22:45
THERESA It'd be worse. There'd be more bills. Right. 

01:22:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING There'll be more bills and there'll be more, you know, feeling of misery, (crosstalk) 

01:22:50
THERESA Uh hmm. 

01:22:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING frustration, agony, anger. 

01:22:55
LORIE Uh hmm. 

01:22:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Maybe mistrust. 

01:22:55
LORIE Uh hmm. 

01:22:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  True. Now, my next question is do you wanna do something different than what you did last week? And if you do, what will it be? 

01:23:10
TOM But I thought that's what you could tell me. 

01:23:10
JOY Yeah. 

01:23:10
LORIE  Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:23:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING I could. But I don't know that it would do any good. 

01:23:15
LORIE  Well, why not? 

01:23:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, I could tell you do something different. Let's figure that out. Let's figure out what would be different. Then, let me, and let me ask you this, another question. When you he, when you apply for a job and you don't get it, how do you feel? 

01:23:35
JOY Depressed. 

01:23:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Depressed, (crosstalk) 

01:23:35
LINDA Yeah, awful. 

01:23:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING depressed, depressed. Okay. When you, when you don't get the job and you feel depressed, does that help you or hurt you? 

01:23:45
THERESA Hurt. 

01:23:45
LORIE Hurts, yeah. 

01:23:45
THERESA It's harder to go out and try looking again for the next job. 

01:23:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. It's harder to go out the next time. 

01:23:50
THERESA It's harder to come home and face the kids. 

01:23:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. So you see it as a failure, right? 

01:23:50
JOY  Uh hmm. 

01:23:55
THERESA Sure. 

01:23:55
LINDA Uh hmm. 

01:23:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Is that right? 

01:23:55
LORIE Yeah. 

01:23:55
THERESA It is. 

01:23:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, now, looking at it as a, as a failure, as a kind of, you know, going to the plate and striking out, you're seeing it that way. Where is that getting you? 

01:24:05
JOY Well it makes you feel worse. 

01:24:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. Is that right? Is there another way you could look at it? Is there another way you could see the rejection that you get or the, the, the, the no that you get when you knock on somebody's door? 

01:24:20
THERESA Maybe that wasn't the right job for me. 

01:24:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. Maybe it wasn't the right job. What else? How else could you see it? 

01:24:30
LORIE  I, I can't see any good about it. Maybe I'm just one step closer. 

01:24:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hmm. Say that again. 

01:24:40
LORIE  Maybe I'm just one step closer. 

01:24:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hmm. How do you mean that? Maybe you could explain that a little bit more? 

01:24:55
LORIE Well, they said that when Edison invented the light bulb, that he, every time he failed he just said that he was one step closer. 

01:25:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING 10,000 times he tried. 

01:25:05
LINDA (laughs) Well, we've got a long way to go. 

01:25:10
JOY Yeah. (laughs) 

01:25:10
TOM  Let's see, at 13 a week. 

01:25:15
THERESA I'll be retired before I even get a job. 

01:25:20
TOM Yeah. 

01:25:20
THERESA I'd be starved, I mean. (laughs) 

01:25:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Well, what will come first, retired or starved or a job? 

01:25:25
LINDA Starve. 

01:25:25
JOY  Well, I don't know. Hopefully a job would come first. 

01:25:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:25:35
JOY  There has got to be one out there somewhere. 

01:25:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING So what will it take to find it? 

01:25:40
JOY  Keep looking. 

01:25:45
LINDA More energy. 

01:25:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING It will take a lot of, a lot of nos, a lot of turndown, won't it? 

01:25:50
JOY  We've already had a lot, I mean. 

01:25:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. All right. Apparently not enough. 

01:25:55
JOY No. 

01:25:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  So what are you willing to do this week in order to get some more turndowns. 

01:26:05
LINDA  Make some more calls, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:26:10
JOY I guess I could get on a joblist(ph) somewhere. 

01:26:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:26:15
JOY Maybe get my foot in the door that way. 

01:26:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  What if it'll hurt? 

01:26:20
JOY I haven't tried it before. I guess... (crosstalk) 

01:26:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Will it hurt. (crosstalk) 

01:26:20
JOY (inaudible ) in. 

01:26:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. I wanna ask Theresa a question. What would it hurt to take a job at minimum wage? 

01:26:30
THERESA  I'll be stuck there. I mean it won't pay the bills. 

01:26:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:26:40
THERESA Uhm. (crosstalk) 

01:26:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  But, uhm, I don't know. Could, do you want to ask her a question? (crosstalk) 

01:26:45
THERESA I mean, you know, I have to pay a babysitter to go to work... (crosstalk) 

01:26:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:26:50
THERESA ...to make minimum wage where I'm bringing home, (crosstalk) 

01:26:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:26:50
THERESA  You pay taxes and whatever. (crosstalk) 

01:26:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:26:55
THERESA So I work with 50 cents an hour. 

01:26:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:26:55
THERESA  Uhm. And, you know, would you work for 50 cents an hour? 

01:27:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING I wouldn't want to, but certainly it would not be my first choice. It would be, ah, it would, you ask, you wanna know what I think? 

01:27:15
THERESA Yeah. 

01:27:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING It would be a choice I'd choose over working for nothing an hour, though, which is what I do, you know. 

01:27:20
THERESA  I don't know. 

01:27:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. Well, (crosstalk) 

01:27:30
THERESA Well, I, I don't expect that. (crosstalk) 

01:27:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING everybody has, you know, yeah, I mean that's not easy to do. 

01:27:30
THERESA Uh hmm. I'm passing it along. 

01:27:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING It sure is. It sure is. 

01:27:35
THERESA  If you could get a job somewhere, where would you go? 

01:27:45
TOM  I don't know anybody who hires luthiers. I, I don't wanna do something other than that. 

01:27:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Okay, what, what could you do this week and the next week that would cheer yourselves up? Because that certainly is a theme that ties this group together, is, is, ah, you know, that you, that, that, that a little cheering up would be in order. What could you do to, to help yourselves feel better? 

01:28:10
LINDA  Hmm. 

01:28:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING If you came here for some help, that's the, that's the helping question... (crosstalk) 

01:28:15
LINDA Uh hmm. 

01:28:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...that I wanna ask you. 

01:28:15
TOM I could sell a guitar. 

01:28:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING No. I mean what can you do that's re, that you have, like, total control of? 

01:28:25
 Well. 

01:28:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING 'Cause you know, you know if you can find a buyer, that's okay. But you might not be able to find a buyer. But what could you do that would, you would have total control of... (crosstalk) 

01:28:30
THERESA  I don't know. 

01:28:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...that might lead, that might lead to, to a selling a guitar? 

01:28:35
TOM  I don't know. Maybe I could take some of my work somewhere, and I wanna, I don't know where I'll take it. 

01:28:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hmm. 

01:28:45
JOY  What about a craft show? 

01:28:50
 Hmm. 

01:28:50
JOY What about a music store? 

01:28:50
LINDA Could be a music store will take you if you work part time... (crosstalk) 

01:28:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hmm. 

01:28:55
LINDA ...in a music store. (crosstalk) 

01:28:55
JOY Sure. 

01:28:55
LINDA You could still make your instruments on the side. (crosstalk) 

01:28:55
JOY Yeah. 

01:28:55
THERESA You might meet people that need (inaudible ). 

01:29:01
JOY (inaudible ) somebody that plays a lute and maybe people go to his concerts and they could tell him who made that great instrument. 

01:29:05
THERESA Yeah. I've got a couple of people asking me about babysitting their kids for them, I mean I could stay home with my kids. I would. (crosstalk). 

01:29:15
 (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

01:29:17
THERESA If I did report the money, I could, you know, if I could get (inaudible )on it. 

01:29:23
LINDA  I, I think, uhm, I need to, ah, I need to do something for myself, you know? My, my mother-in-law said she'd be willing to watch the kids while I looked for it. But she wouldn't baby-sit full-time. (inaudible ) I think for me this week I, I'd just do something for myself that might hopefully make me feel better. 

01:29:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Maybe get away from the whole thing... (crosstalk) 

01:29:45
LINDA Right. 

01:29:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...and do something for yourself like have some fun. 

01:29:45
LINDA  Yeah. 

01:29:50
JOY Maybe dinner or a movie. (crosstalk) 

01:29:50
LINDA Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:29:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. Uh hmm. 

01:29:50
JOY We could do that this week. 

01:29:50
LINDA Yes. 

01:29:50
LORIE  I think that I need to go home and talk to my husband. 

01:29:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hmm. About what? 

01:30:00
LORIE Ah, he keeps telling me he doesn't see me doing anything but I don't do anything because I don't know what I wanna do. 

01:30:10
JOY Do you do anything around the house? Do you cook his dinner? Do you wash his socks, vacuum the floors? 

01:30:15
LORIE Well yeah I do that stuff. What he means going out and getting a job and, (crosstalk) 

01:30:20
 Uh hmm. 

01:30:20
THERESA That's not a job? 

01:30:20
LORIE Well I don't wanna go back to what I was doing before and I don't know what else to do. 

01:30:25
JOY Do you have hobbies? Maybe you can turn that into something that you'd like in terms of, and do what (inaudible ) and do it at home. 

01:30:35
LORIE Well I guess I could think about it. 

01:30:40
LINDA Uh hmm. 

01:30:40
THERESA Yeah I used to be (inaudible ) because I'm in an aerobics class before, you know, my husband left, and that was fun. Of course, it's too much money now. 

01:30:50
TOM (inaudible ) 

01:30:51
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  You know, I think it's interesting that this group is, ah, ah each person is trying to help the other person. I think that's ah, you know, a, a, as much as we can expect in our first session. If we can get that far, it's pretty good. Is there anything else you could do that would help you to feel better the next week? Remember two pathways, feeling miserable, feeing better. 

01:31:20
 Uh hmm. 

01:31:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Which one is it going to be? For you, Tom which one, which one do you want? 

01:31:25
TOM Oh I wanna feel better. 

01:31:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING All right, which, what would you have to do on that pathway? What will help you? 

01:31:30
TOM Do something different. 

01:31:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Which would be what? 

01:31:30
TOM  I still don't know, I, maybe go to a music store. 

01:31:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm, which one would you go to? 

01:31:40
TOM  I don't know. There's, there's, one right around the corner from my house. I pass it everyday. 

01:31:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. Is that, that's counted as pathway? 

01:31:50
TOM Yeah. 

01:31:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay if you, if you didn't do it, which pathway would you be on? 

01:31:55
TOM Well I'll still be, I guess, feeling miserable. 

01:31:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay and going out to, to eat.

01:33:05
THERESA Right now and, uhm, I really love that aerobics class.

DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Oh. (crosstalk) 

01:33:10
THERESA I really, really love that. I, I can't. I can't afford it but maybe I could do some of it at home. 

01:33:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Oh, okay, so which pathway is that? 

01:33:20
THERESA Oh I love that, that would be. (crosstalk) 

01:33:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING That's this one? 

01:33:20
THERESA Yeah. 

01:33:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. I wanna ask you all something. Up till now, does this kinda prey on your mind or you just think about it all the time? 

01:33:25
LORIE Uh hmm. 

01:33:25
 Sure. 

01:33:25
 Uh hmm. 

01:33:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And you kinda started to... (crosstalk) 

01:33:30
THERESA Yeah. 

01:33:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...think well. It's kinda I got a miserable deal here and so on, right? 

01:33:35
 Uh hmm. 

01:33:35
 Uh hmm. 

01:33:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Now does thinking about it and churning it up and nursing it along, where is that getting you? 

01:33:40
 Think, things would feel worse. 

01:33:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING All right. It makes you feel worse. Okay. Do you wanna feel worse or better next week? 

01:33:45
THERESA Better. (crosstalk) 

01:33:45
LORIE Better. 

01:33:45
 Better. 

01:33:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. So what about getting away from it this week, putting it on hold and doing these things? Would these help or hurt as far as putting all the stuff on hold for a little while? 

01:33:55
 It could help. 

01:33:55
 Can't hurt anything. 

01:33:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING It can't hurt. 

01:33:55
 Yeah. 

01:33:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  You've been unemployed, another week isn't gonna kill you. But the I, and some of you are actually gonna take some action to do something about it. Direct action others are gonna try to get away from it (inaudible ) for a little bit... (crosstalk) 

01:34:11
LINDA Uh hmm. 

01:34:11
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Okay, ah, let me ask you another question. How hard are you willing to, to work at this, this week in order to have do this in order to feel a little bit better? Is this a "maybe," is this, "ah, I could," "I might" or "no, I'm really going to do this?" Which one of those is it? 

01:34:30
LINDA I really. 

01:34:30
JOY Yeah. 

01:34:30
LINDA Really gonna do it. (crosstalk)

01:34:30
LORIE Really gonna do it. 

01:34:30
TOM  Well I'm gonna do it and what if it fails? I mean what, you know, I go up there and they say they have, you know, all of these factory-bought stuff and they don't want my stuff? 

01:34:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well I'll ask you this... (crosstalk) 

01:34:45
TOM They wanna. 

01:34:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...what if you don't do it? 

01:34:45
TOM Well I guess I'll never know. 

01:34:45
 You're never gonna know... (crosstalk) 

01:34:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:34:45
 Unless you try it and you won't be any worse off (inaudible )... (crosstalk) 

01:34:52
JOY You're not doing anything anyway. 

01:34:52
TOM  Wait a minute, yes, I have been doing some stuff. (crosstalk) 

01:34:55
JOY You've been making (inaudible ) lose but at least now you can find out, give it a try. (crosstalk)

01:35:00
JOY I teach music. I'd love to see one. 

01:35:00
TOM  I'm bringing it next week. 

01:35:05
JOY That would be good. 

01:35:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. You're willing to do that? Bring one next week and show us what you do. We can spend a little time doing that. 

01:35:10
TOM Sure. 

01:35:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING You don't sound really excited about that possibility? 

01:35:15
TOM Well I'm, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:35:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING I mean, I'm, I didn't say we'd buy one. I just said that we could look at it. 

01:35:20
TOM Yeah I'm, uh, that's, that's what I was thinking, you know, I, I can show people my stuff all day and finding somebody who wants to buy one, that's the trick. 

01:35:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. When did you just, when was the last time you just showed one to anybody? 

01:35:30
TOM Oh I don't, that's been ages. 

01:35:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Oh, well, here's five people willing to look at it. 

01:35:35
 Maybe we know somebody with a guitar. 

01:35:40
 Uh hmm. 

01:35:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hmm. That's interesting. Lorie, you got something to do?

LINDA No, we did it. 

01:36:01
JOY  We did it. 

01:36:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, would you want we shake hands on it? 

01:36:05
LINDA Sure. 

01:36:05
JOY Sure. 

01:36:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING You know what shaking hands means? 

01:36:05
JOY  It's an agreement. 

01:36:10
LINDA Agreement. (crosstalk) 

01:36:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING It's an agreement, okay, you know, like the football team and the basketball team, what do they do right before they take floor? 

01:36:15
 Uh hmm. 

01:36:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Huh? What do they do? You've seen, you've seen basketball. I don't understand you're reluctance. 

01:36:25
THERESA My husband watch basketball. I don't do that. 

01:36:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. You're willing to shake hands individually? 

01:36:30
THERESA Yeah, I can do that. 

01:36:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. Who you gonna shake hands with? 

01:36:35
THERESA Uhm, her.

01:36:55
LORIE I'll shake hands with you. 

01:36:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh, okay. All right? Good. All right. Well, we'll see you next week same time, same place. 

01:37:00
 Okay. 

01:37:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Okay? 

01:37:05
JOY Okay. 

01:37:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Thank you. Nice to see you and we'll talk to you again. 

01:37:15
[sil.] 

01:37:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Let's spend a few minutes now talking about what happened and, ah, trying to process, ah, the interactions that you witnessed and see what happened in terms of the application of the WDEP system applied to the, what was mostly I think the, ah, initial stage of group counseling so let's hear some comments from, ah, either the people in the group or from the audience, either one. Yeah? 

01:37:40
 Well, I, I was kinda impressed the way the, you know, Tom was kinda just floating around and the group, kinda, I think (inaudible ) and put a little pressure on him and (inaudible ) a little accountability on him. 

01:37:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm, okay, ah, so I have a little axiom that I learned somewhere along the line, uh, it's trust the process. Ah, as a counselor you don't have to do everything. I just like to sit back and just let them talk a little bit, ah, you can either have a group counseling or you can have one-to-one counseling in a group and sometimes group counselors tend to say, okay, now you, now you, now you. What you have to do in the beginning, what I like to back off from that and let them, ah, take some charge of it which they were quite capable of doing and in doing so, one of the things that came out was to, ah, to do just that which is to, ah, hold Tom accountable, uhm, for some things in that sense. Okay? Any other observations or comments about, ah, how I tried to, ah, get the inclusion going or, or, ah, set some goals in the beginning? I think that was pretty clear. 

01:38:50
 Uh hmm. 

01:38:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING What are your observations about that? 

01:38:55
 I like the way that you brought in, uhm, what's her name? 

01:39:00
 Lorie. 

01:39:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Lorie. 

01:39:00
 Yeah, Lorie. 

01:39:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Lorie. 

01:39:00
 The way you brought her and because, uhm, and you had him ask her personally, how do you feel that you would fit in this group and that brought her in to have, ah, purpose along with the group. (crosstalk) 

01:39:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:39:15
 And I like the way you do that. 

01:39:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Ah, there's, there's a, it's very realistic, isn't it? You think you got a group that has a common theme and then all of a sudden you don't. And, ah, so, so it's very realistic as to what happens and, ah, so how do you deal with that? 

01:39:30
 Uh hmm. 

01:39:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And I was glad she played that role because it gave me a chance to struggle with that a little bit to try to get her involved in the group even though... (crosstalk) 

01:39:40
 Uh hmm. 

01:39:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...she was, ah, could have been quite an outsider. 

01:39:40
 Uh hmm. 

01:39:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And I, that's why I tried to help her clarify what is it you want? Do you want this group to help you figure out how to talk to your husband or do you wanna get a job? And, ah, she wasn't quite clear or at least I didn't think she was quite clear on it, ah, ah, in the beginning and though she kind of, you know, wanted to, mostly not to work. 

01:40:00
 Uh hmm. 

01:40:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Ah, but, but at the same time she wanted to work because of, of these mixed motives. So, uh, to try to make sure that she's part of the group is, is important and the first, most of the first part of what I did was really trying to get, set some goals, trying to do some, ah, effort to get them included in the group and, ah, not necessarily to solve the problem. The urge is, well, let's get all these people jobs. 

01:40:25
 Okay. 

01:40:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING That's the content level. There's also the process level which is what's happening in this group at this moment and, uh, do they feel these issues of involvement and inclusion in the group. Do they, do they feel that those issues are being resolved? So that was my thinking more than my trying to get them a job. Once you start as a counselor to try to get people jobs, ah, you're gonna, you're, uh, doomed to failure because, (crosstalk) 

01:40:45
 Uh hmm. 

01:40:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Because there's going to be a lot of resistance to that, ah, 'cause they're feeling failure already, plus how in the world can you do it? 

01:40:55
 Uh hmm. 

01:40:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING You just can't really do that very well. So, ah, I tried to bypass that except at the end, ah, where we got to doing some things that some are gonna do some things where they might be able to get a job, but mostly it was sort of a process goal that they had which is to feel better even though they can't solve the problem. 

01:41:10
 Uh hmm. 

01:41:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Any other observations or comments? I'd like to hear some, some discussion with this. 

01:41:15
 Uh hmm. 

01:41:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  As to how the WDEP system was used. 

01:41:25
[sil.] 

01:41:25
LORIE Well from my perspective it was kinda interesting because when we started out I did feel that, you know, I am not a part of this but it did draw me... (crosstalk) 

01:41:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:41:35
LORIE And that by the end I did feel like I was included in the... (crosstalk) 

01:41:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:41:40
LORIE As part of the group. 

01:41:40
 Uh hmm. Yeah. 

01:41:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. 

01:41:40
TOM And the way you had me ask the question to her, I think, really, I really felt a change in, in even in just the role-play... (crosstalk) 

01:41:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:41:50
TOM From when I first asked the question to the group and it's like, come on, guys against her... (crosstalk) 

01:41:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:41:55
TOM ...and, and then when you had me focus it on her and then she started explaining that it was, I had, I had a feeling of a little more, you know, bringing together... (crosstalk) 

01:42:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:42:00
TOM Like that. 

01:42:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, the idea is try to get people to talk to each other, rather than just vaguely into the, to the group. That's okay but I mean also if you have a, ah, something to say to a person, I like to say well, speak to that person in the second person singular, not in the third person singular... (crosstalk) 

01:42:20
TOM Uh hmm. 

01:42:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING You know well she, she, she like she's not here, ah, why not speak directly to her? So, so that was it. (inaudible ) It also gets people involved a little bit. It gets some energy in the group here. I was hoping to be more energy in this group because they also seem to be Oh, down in the dumps about not working, and, and their anger didn't last very long except Theresa, hers, hers... (crosstalk) 

01:42:40
 Hmm. 

01:42:40
 Uh hmm. 

01:42:40
THERESA I try... (crosstalk) (inaudible ) 

01:42:42
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...hers was more of a calculated calm resistance, ah, which was okay. Very, very realistic, so... (crosstalk) 

01:42:45
 Uh hmm. 

01:42:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...but, but I was trying to get some, some energy and sometimes when you have somebody talk to somebody else you get a little conflict going. (crosstalk) 

01:42:50
 Uh hmm. 

01:42:50
JOY  Well it did break the ice... (crosstalk) 

01:42:55
 Yeah. 

01:42:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:42:55
JOY ...and then we did (inaudible ) up ... (crosstalk) 

01:42:57
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:42:57
JOY ...to one another. (crosstalk) 

01:42:57
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:42:57
 Hmm. 

01:42:57
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Yes, John? 

01:43:00
JOHN I was, when Joy was speaking I, I never did catch what she studied in college and I don't think you pursued that and then the, I was wondering, you know, well, that would be a logical question and maybe a thing as, ah, you taken all the courses or something more in it, or are you more updated or part time that, are there any reason, maybe I've missed it, but I didn't catch what she did or, or you didn't seem to be concerned about that. 

01:43:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  I, I wasn't concerned yet about any of that with anybody as far as their job skill level or their educational background. I thought we need to get these people involved in this group and get them doing something quickly that they can feel good about. (crosstalk) 

01:43:40
 Uh hmm. 

01:43:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And then view what the content issues of the types of jobs they're applying for and, ah, and, and their background and their skills and all of that. Ah, that really wasn't the goal that I thought... (crosstalk) 

01:43:50
 Yeah. 

01:43:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...that, that we could really get into 'cause once I do it with Joy and then I have to do it with everybody... (crosstalk) 

01:43:55
 Yeah. 

01:43:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...and I think they've thought about that and they've talked about that and they probably rehashed that a thousand times in their own mind and I, it is legitimate and necessary to bring out but I just chose a different direction... (crosstalk) 

01:44:05
 Uh hmm. 

01:44:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...but you could choose that direction with all of them and it would be, ah, just as legitimate as what I was trying to do. But I chose to, to get them to, my goal was to get them to do something quickly that they could feel good about and maybe and I, and I thought this is probably gonna work best over here, putting aside all the co, all the, the effort to get a job, putting aside, set it aside and then do something to, that we can feel good about quickly. 

01:44:30
JOY And we (inaudible )? 

01:44:34
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yes. 

01:44:34
JOY  Yeah. 

01:44:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And, ah, and then we can get into the other issues later on but, but I just chose the, to, to go in that direction because I thought it would have been a quagmire to try to explore these things with them because that's already what they're upset about is, is their skill level not being adequate or their skill level not being something that other people want. (crosstalk) 

01:44:55
 Uh hmm. 

01:44:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And ah, I just thought it might create more upheaval, turmoil, dissatisfaction and down in the dumps kind of thinking if we had gone in that direction. I'll never know because I didn't do that but that was my thought at the time, which could have been counterbalanced with the opposite thought. You know, you could go in so many different directions if you, if you thought differently. 

01:45:15
 Yeah. 

01:45:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Yeah. 

01:45:20
 I thought it was good how you helped them put in perspective what they thought they were actually doing, some of them thought that they were doing as much as they could handle... (crosstalk) 

01:45:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Yeah. Uh hmm. 

01:45:30
 ...and then by the end of the session... (crosstalk) 

01:45:30
 Yeah. 

01:45:30
 They realized what they were doing wasn't getting them where they needed to go. (crosstalk) 

01:45:35
 Uh hmm. 

01:45:35
 And they, they did an about-face, well I, I could do something, something else... (crosstalk) 

01:45:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:45:40
 Yeah. 

01:45:40
 I thought it was interesting how you worked. Some people weren't doing anything but everybody still seemed to fit to that together at the end. 

01:45:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, and, and, ah, I, I like to just kinda go right up to the threshold of it, of, of resolving something and then back off from it. That's just a personal style which you know is no better than another personal style, but I try to, to get them to the point where they really looked at how, how much effort they're, they're exerting to get the, a, a job and, and not to criticize them because everybody is at a different place. Some people feel, well they haven't done much, other people feel they have done a lot more. The last thing I wanna do is leave them to a point where they choose to feel guilty about these or guiltier. That would not be helpful at all. (crosstalk) 

01:46:25
 Uh hmm. 

01:46:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING But I did wanna get them to a point where they are willing to think, put that thought in the back of their mind and they'll think about that. They'll think about, gee, if collectively we only made 13, ah, contacts, we need to do a little bit more so you, that was another way to diffuse some of the possible guilt that I think they might have, might feel if I had pushed too hard, is to, is to make it a collective number rather than well did you 10, you did one, you did one, and you did none, you did, I don't know how many Theresa did. (crosstalk) 

01:46:55
 Two. 

01:46:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Two, two, okay, but the point, the, the reality is if that's what you're doing it's gonna be a long time before you get a job... (crosstalk) 

01:47:00
 Uh hmm. 

01:47:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...and, ah, but in the back of my mind is the thought that, that they need to get more rejections... (crosstalk) 

01:47:05
 Uh hmm. 

01:47:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...and that's why I said, does it help you to perceive this is as a failure? (crosstalk) 

01:47:10
 Uh hmm. 

01:47:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And Lorie, and I knew somebody would say it, and Lorie said well maybe, it takes me one step closer to where I'm going and if they didn't... (crosstalk) 

01:47:15
 Uh hmm. 

01:47:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Say it, I would have said it. (crosstalk) 

01:47:20
 Uh hmm. 

01:47:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING But, ah, that's the fact of the matter is, the reality is that in order to get a job you need to have a lot of rejections and I wanna help them. One of my goals is to help them perceive differently that a rejection of a, at a job application is not a failure. It's a step... (crosstalk) 

01:47:35
 Uh hmm. 

01:47:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...along the way and a, and a, and my goal will be, I don't know if they'll buy it or not but I won't, I won't impose it, but I would throw at them the possibility of, of applying for some jobs even though they don't want them... (crosstalk) 

01:47:45
 Uh hmm. 

01:47:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  To get more Nos so that they can perceive those failures not as failures but as successes. (crosstalk) 

01:47:55
 Uh hmm. 

01:47:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING I'm gonna go apply for a job even though I don't want it, and I'm gonna turn it down if they offer it. (Laughs) And, and I, I think Theresa would have been open to that... (crosstalk) 

01:48:00
 Uh hmm. 

01:48:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...to turning down some jobs that were offered to her... (crosstalk) 

01:48:00
 Uh hmm. 

01:48:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  So I think it would have been a very... (crosstalk) 

01:48:05
 Yeah. 

01:48:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...easy plan for her to make and, ah, because then you're getting people to perceive differently, to think differently... (crosstalk) 

01:48:10
 Uh hmm. 

01:48:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...not only to do differently but to per, but to think differently about it. (crosstalk) 

01:48:15
 Uh hmm. 

01:48:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And, and when they do that, they're, they're, they're planning, they're co, they're doing, they're, they're, they would really be in that working stage, the third stage. You see, And they weren't there yet... (crosstalk) 

01:48:25
 Okay(ph). 

01:48:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...they weren't ready to cognitively restructure their thinking. (crosstalk) 

01:48:25
 Uh hmm. 

01:48:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Cognitively restructure their thinking. I might be a little, ah, ah, ah, a little redundant to say that, but, but, ah, they weren't ready to restructure their thinking yet... (crosstalk) 

01:48:35
 Uh hmm. 

01:48:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...so that's why I didn't push that point. Sometimes you can take what really is a task that's done down the road somewhere, impose it on the beginning of a group and they'll, and they, and they just fight, resist... (crosstalk) 

01:48:45
 Uh hmm. 

01:48:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...and the group falls apart. (crosstalk) 

01:48:45
 Uh hmm. 

01:48:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING I think it's important to recognize that they, these people are at the beginning of this, of the group process, the initial stage and to try to, too much planning and too much cognitive restructuring and, and so on would have really fallen, it wouldn't have worked. (crosstalk) 

01:49:00
 Uh hmm. 

01:49:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  It would have been okay to try it. You can try it sometimes but I wouldn't expect it would work. 

01:49:05
 It felt like you were trying to take the pressure off... (crosstalk) 

01:49:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:49:10
 ...because I felt relieved. (crosstalk) 

01:49:10
 Uh hmm. 

01:49:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:49:10
THERESA Yeah. 

01:49:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. 

01:49:10
THERESA Well, I came in and trying to be very hostile and then having you become more positive you know, made it more and more difficult for me to make you the enemy which is what I was trying... (crosstalk) 

01:49:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:49:20
THERESA ...to do. 

01:49:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. Uh hmm. Oh, I got that idea. (crosstalk) 

01:49:25
 (inaudible ). 

01:49:27
THERESA You did? (Laughs) 

01:49:27
TOM I was kinda curious, uhm, knowing that this was an initial phase and if we would have had more time if the, if the gender thing would have gone on and if that would have heated up you know, how would you have handled that and how, how long you would have let that continue? 

01:49:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, ah, I didn't wanna feed it, you know and I didn't want to, uhm, you know, confront it either to keep it. (crosstalk) 

01:49:50
 Uh hmm. 

01:49:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING I didn't wanna confront the issue, but give her a chance to, to express that she feels that way and that it's okay... (crosstalk) 

01:49:55
 Uh hmm. 

01:49:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING I don't blame you for feeling this way. We got a lot of reasons for not, for not she said she'd have some bad experience and, and, ah, she, I didn't wanna confront it and, and, say we'll give, why don't you give me a chance or something... (crosstalk) 

01:50:05
THERESA Uh hmm. 

01:50:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...I don't know, I just didn't feel like to say that. But, but, uhm, I'll let her have those feelings for a while and not... (crosstalk) 

01:50:15
THERESA Uh hmm. 

01:50:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING I mean, by that, I mean, not, not deal with them just yet. 

01:50:15
THERESA Yeah. 

01:50:15
 What if, what if it heated up between her and I? You know, if, if you would've had a couple of members going at it. 

01:50:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uhm, well, I would turn that around and say, "Wow, that, you know, I, I'm glad to see you disagreeing because it's a, it's certainly a sign that you wanna work at this." (crosstalk) 

01:50:35
JOY Uh hmm. 

01:50:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And a lot of times people don't express these disagreements till after they've really been on a group for long time and this group seems making a lot of progress. You're willing to do, to come right out with your disagreements right away. I don't think you need to resolve it but, but rather turn it around, reframe it, make it a positive... (crosstalk) 

01:50:50
JOY Uh hmm. 

01:50:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...kind of a interaction that they feel. (crosstalk) 

01:50:55
LORIE Uh hmm. 

01:50:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And that's doing the unexpected. It's a paradoxical technique... (crosstalk) 

01:51:00
JOY Uh hmm. 

01:51:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...which I have really talked much about in this, in this, ah, in these two hours. But, but, ah, reframing is a very powerful paradoxical technique to take what is a failure and turn it around and make it a success. (crosstalk) 

01:51:10
JOY Uh hmm. 

01:51:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING That could be done in that case. (crosstalk) 

01:51:10
LORIE  Uh hmm. 

01:51:15
 Hmm. Why is it so important for each one to verbalize their plan of action? 

01:51:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. Who wants to talk about that? Maybe somebody has a, has, ah, an answer to that. 

01:51:25
JOY Because it makes it real... (crosstalk) 

01:51:25
LORIE Uh hmm. 

01:51:25
JOY ...to commit to an(ph) end. 

01:51:25
 Hmm. I like, uhm, uhm, you suggested going out is that if you sold a guitar and you said, but this isn't something... (crosstalk) 

01:51:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:51:35
 ...you can control... (crosstalk) 

01:51:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:51:35
 ...how can you control it? You said even if I go out and show it, but then toward the end, you all decided to bring it in and let us see it, and that's like taking, giving him that experience that this is a good experience here which will later change his thinking and you didn't try to change it at that time that that will make you feel good and tell him that the experience was going to... (crosstalk) 

01:51:55
 Uh hmm. 

01:51:55
 ...be better but even gave him an opportunity just right changing his thinking... (crosstalk) 

01:52:00
 That's in practice, it was practice. (crosstalk) 

01:52:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, that's in practice, yeah? (crosstalk) 

01:52:00
  Right. 

01:52:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And then I would really turn that into a positive experience for all of them, if I could. (crosstalk) 

01:52:10
 Uh hmm. 

01:52:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Ah, I mean, I can't do it for them but what I mean... (crosstalk) 

01:52:10
 Right. 

01:52:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...is I structure in such a way that, that, ah, they could get him some feedback about how he presented this and... (crosstalk) 

01:52:15
 Yeah. 

01:52:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...and then I'd ask, be asking the whole group what did you learn from this... (crosstalk) 

01:52:20
 Uh hmm. 

01:52:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...and how can you use or anything you, you learn from what happened here that you could use on your job interviews. 

01:52:25
 Okay. 

01:52:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uhm, in other words, it could be a real catalyst... (crosstalk) 

01:52:30
 That's right. 

01:52:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...kind of a, kind of thing. But, uhm, getting into verbalizes that kind of plan and... (crosstalk) 

01:52:35
 Uh hmm. 

01:52:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...and we even write it down, which we didn't do, but getting them to do that would be very, very helpful, ah, because it's one thing to think about and it's another thing that you hear yourself say it. (crosstalk) 

01:52:45
 Uh hmm. 

01:52:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And I, and hearing yourself say it is kind of a mid, ah, ah, uhm, an intermediate step between thinking it and doing it. 

01:52:50
  Now, next week when they come back, some of them will probably have not have a commitment. (crosstalk) 

01:53:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING No. 

01:53:00
 Maybe these some of them wanna cut their commitment because one of them didn't get a day better and they just felt frustrated because I don't have money for babysitter. I don't have the money for even going out. Now, they may come to be even more frustrated than they were because they even failed at their commitment. What would you do with that? 

01:53:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING They come back and they said they didn't do it. I'd say, "Well, you did three out of four things. You thought about it, you talked about it, you planned it, the only thing left is the follow through on it." (crosstalk) 

01:53:30
 Uh hmm. 

01:53:30
JOY Hmm. 

01:53:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING So turn that failure into a success. (crosstalk) 

01:53:35
 Hmm. 

01:53:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Rather than they, they, they didn't follow it, didn't do it, well, you did in part of it. Now, they could also say, was it going to help you or is it going to hurt you? If you don't follow through on this, you could go back in their commitment. I'd try to pull out that commitment and, ah, get them to, to be firmly committed to working on this. You could go back to that how hard you wanna work at this... (crosstalk) 

01:53:55
 Uh hmm. 

01:53:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...and, ah, so, so there's a lot of things you could do with that. Reframing it from negative to positive, using it to help them make evaluation judgments on their own behavior, and going, firmly going back to their original commitment. (crosstalk) 

01:54:05
 Uh hmm. 

01:54:05
 Is it important to end each session in a positive note like you did? 

01:54:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING I think it is specially the first session. But I think every session should, you should, you know, we, we, it, it's, it's very advantageous to try to make it a good experience for the people. The first session, it seems to me, needs to have the element of hope. And if there's anything I wanna teach them indirectly is that there is hope, that a better life is possible for you. And it seems to me that that's the idea of every session, but especially at first, just because... (crosstalk) 

01:54:40
 Uh hmm. 

01:54:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...people come for counseling and they feel like they're down the pits, I use the, the metaphor, down in the dumps. And, ah, would you like to get out of the dumps and things like that... (crosstalk) 

01:54:45
 Uh hmm. 

01:54:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...and, and I didn't think it but I, I could have said something about, "Well, you, you made the first step for getting out of the dumps." (crosstalk) 

01:54:55
 Uh hmm. 

01:54:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And, ah, the idea of being that, there is some hope, that life can be, maybe not totally beautiful but it can be, at least, not so painful. 

01:55:05
JOY And then we'll bring it back. 

01:55:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:55:05
JOY That we felt good at... (crosstalk) 

01:55:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:55:05
JOY ...the end of it. 

01:55:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:55:05
JOY  We want, we wanna feel good so we'll come back next week. (crosstalk) 

01:55:10
 Hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:55:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. I mean, the idea is to hook them into the group. 

01:55:15
 Right. (crosstalk) 

01:55:15
 Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:55:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING They don't come back, you, you know, there's nothing you can do. (crosstalk) 

01:55:15
 Uh hmm. 

01:55:15
 And that commitment helps them, helps them with that, too. (crosstalk) 

01:55:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:55:20
 Making any sense. 

01:55:20
 You also seem to make it very simple. Which road do you want... (crosstalk) 

01:55:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Oh, yes. 

01:55:25
 ...road in the misery road or the out of the dumps road. And when they focused on that, during that next week, it's going to be hard for them to look at what they're doing and say, "Am I going down in the dumps... (crosstalk) 

01:55:35
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

01:55:35
 ...or am I not?" So it was... (crosstalk) 

01:55:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Right. 

01:55:40
 ...sort of planting seeds. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:55:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Good. Thank you for bringing that up because I, I think it's very important. It's a metaphor analogy... (crosstalk) 

01:55:45
 Uh hmm. 

01:55:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And that is one of my favorites and it's very useful in any kind of counseling group or individual that there's two pathways. Keep it simple. Don't make life so complicated. (crosstalk) 

01:55:50
 Uh hmm. 

01:55:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  There's either misery or there's happiness. Now, of course, it's more complicated than that, but, but we have to try to get people moving, get some energy going, get some motivation here... (crosstalk) 

01:56:00
 Uh hmm. 

01:56:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...and, and, what if I go down this road, my golly, I'm headed to right direction. Now, it might not be perfect, there's bumps, there's chuckholes. (crosstalk) 

01:56:10
 Uh hmm. 

01:56:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING There's, you know, there's, there's landslides. (crosstalk) 

01:56:10
 Yeah. 

01:56:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING But one thing is for sure that, that it's, it's a better road than this road. This road is misery. (crosstalk) 

01:56:15
 Uh hmm. 

01:56:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING And, ah, the idea is to get them to be motivated. (crosstalk) 

01:56:20
 Uh hmm. 

01:56:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. Our time is just about up and I'd like to say that, ah, in, in, in viewing this tape, I think it is important to try to view it more than once. (crosstalk) 

01:56:30
 Uh hmm. 

01:56:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Ah, this is a two-hour tape and the first hour was trying to summarize control theory and reality therapy with the emphasis on the WDEP system. I talk rather fast during these sessions. About three hundred words a minute with a gas up to 450. So it does take some, ah, effort to right things down. I would suggest viewing the video tape a couple of times and especially viewing, ah, the role play again and analyzing what you saw happening as far as the use of reality therapy, as far as the use of the WDEP System. What needs were being fulfilled? What needs were not being fulfilled? And also view it with other directions that you may choose to go in. And then once again, I'd like to thank everybody for coming and taking part in this, ah, video and, ah, wish everybody the best of luck, especially our group. I know that, ah, very shortly, they will all be employed. Thanks again.
