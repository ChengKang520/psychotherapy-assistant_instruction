THERAPY Talks Neurofeedback: A Brain-based Intervention When Counseling and Medication are not Sufficient Lori A. Russell-Chapin 

00:01:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I'm so thrilled to be here today. I'm gonna talk to you about neurofeedback which is really one of my really far favorite reaching passionate issues in Counselor Education today. I hope you can understand that this is something not really new, I mean, it's relatively old, but I wanna tell you a story and I know you've had this client. But this is the story of a client who comes into your office. They've been there-- maybe they've been to other counselors five or six times, you're the sixth now counselor and they are really wanting special attention. Uhm, the other five counselors have done a wonderful job, behaviors have changed, but they are searching for one new thing, something that's gonna make a difference. And I really think they're searching for this missing piece, and neurofeedback, I believe, is that ner-- that missing piece. I've been doing therapy now for about, I don't know, 30 years, I hate to admit that, 30 years, and I've been doing neurofeedback for about five. And it seems to me that this is the missing piece, so I will talk to you a little bit about-- I'm gonna call him Mark(ph), one of my clients, uhm, who came to me, he had a college education, very bright, young man but he just couldn't talk about-- he just didn't have any relationships. He had been recently diagnosed with Asperger or social communication disorder, and just had no social relationship skills. Uhm, he came into my office. Not once that he looked at me, he would not talk to me but he was extremely compliant. He really did what I ask him to do. So, we did a neurofeedback assessment. I found out that I think neurofeedback could be helpful to him and we proceeded on with these sessions. I do these sessions for about-- for his protocol about 40 sessions at 20 minutes a time, and Mark(ph), uhm, didn't make a lot of changes in beginning, still was not looking at me. About session 10, Mark(ph) began to do some really interesting things. I'd walk down the hall with him and instead he's walking behind me, he would walk beside me. Then, about session 11, he started looking at me and he would honestly talk to me and he'd say hello and I thought, well, that was really me. So, we'd get into this room where I had my neurofeedback equipment and, ah, he still wasn't talking to me. But I'd have to say about session 20, and I know it sounds like a long time, but about session 20 Mark(ph) began to ask questions and he would say, "Well, how are you doing?" 

00:04:10
Lori A. Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:04:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uhm, about that time, too, we had an unfortunate emergency in our family and my mother-in-law passed away so I had to cancel a couple of sessions. When I told him I had a death in the family, he just looked at me and didn't say anything. And so, I went to the funeral. We came back. About session 25, I'm getting things ready in the computer and Mark(ph) all of a sudden says to me, "I wanna ask you a question. Uhm, how is your husband doing with his mother's death?" I stopped literally what I was doing and I put everything down and I had, I had an engaged conversation with Mark(ph). That was the beginning where I knew neurofeedback was beginning to work. I will have to tell you with the end of our 48 session, we were having incredible conversations. Ah, I think Mark(ph) made huge changes because of this brain-ba-- based neurofeedback. So let me tell you a little bit about neurofeedback. 

00:05:05
Neurofeedback (NFB) Definition • Biofeedback for the Brain • Regulates brainwaves by teaching self-regulation • Operates with EEG and computerized software • Uses operant and classical conditioning • Restores the brain's efficiency 

00:05:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uhm, I know many of you know some of these information, but neurofeedback is often called biofeedback for the brain and sometimes you'll hear it called non-invasive surgery. I don't really like that one, but I like the non-invasive part. It does not hurt. What it does is that it regulates or re-regulates the brainwaves by teaching our client self-regulation skills. This is a skill that we use. And I will show you this, I brought for the audience today, uhm, this is my EEG machine, the electroencephalograph machine, and the clients can just, you know, wear on their co-- on their neck or I have it attached to something in the office. Uhm, so this electroencephalograph actually, ah, with the help of these little electrodes that we put on with conductors paste, what it does is that it catches the brainwaves or echoes of these brainwaves and, uhm, then I can regulate those dysfunctional brainwaves. So, what it does is that it catches those brainwaves. And then, as a technician, what I tend to do is I operate this, this computerized software software and I set thresholds. 

00:06:05
Neurofeedback (NFB) Definition • Biofeedback for the Brain • Regulates brainwaves by teaching self-regulation • Operates with EEG and computerized software • Uses operant and classical conditioning • Restores the brain's efficiency 

00:06:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And these set-- these thresholds either inhibit certain brainwaves or they reinforce certain brainwaves. And that's just done with the principles of operant and classical condi-- conditioning. So, I can deal with music, I can deal with puzzles. What I love is-- ah, down the road-- and, and Mark(ph) was a good example. Sometimes it might get a little boring, but what I asked Mark(ph) to do was to bring in his favorite video. And so we trained his favorite music video, or we trained to his favorite DVD and then he love that. So when the brain hit what it's supposed to do, I just thought this is fascinating, then his, his picture will continue to unfold. When the brain doesn't do what it's supposed to do, then the puzzle or the music or the DVD stops. And I find that just so fascinating. The brain loves to be challenged and so it really wants to be stimulated. So the whole idea of this is to restore the brain's efficiency. 

00:06:55
Neurofeedback (NFB) Definition • Biofeedback for the Brain • Regulates brainwaves by teaching self-regulation • Operates with EEG and computerized software • Uses operant and classical conditioning • Restores the brain's efficiency Goal of NFB • Correct dysregulated over-arousal, under-arousal and unstable brain. • Imagine your brain doing the right task at the right time with the right brainwave! 

00:06:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Now, the goal of neurofeedback, I think is fascinating too. And many of you probably know there's a new-- you might know people who are like this actually. But there are basically three brain states. There's the over-arouse brain state. I'm an example of the over-arouse, really busy all the time. There's the under-arouse person or brain state. That's the person who maybe, I don't know, walks really slowly or they might have depressive symptoms with that would be under-aroused. And then of course there's the unstable brain. Now the unstable brain maybe doesn't sound as much like the over-aroused or the under-aroused but, ah, I know you know people that-- who have unstable brains, too. Our brain has to go to these different brain states and I'll talk to you little bit about brainwaves in a second. But unstable brains have a really difficult time doing that and so they might be the people who have migraines. They might be the people who, uhm, were diagnosed bipolar. So, all of us have this dysregulated brain. So here's what I think is so cool about neurofeedback. 

00:08:00
Goal of NFB • Correct dysregulated over-arousal, under-arousal and unstable brain. • Imagine your brain doing the right task at the right time with the right brainwave! 

00:08:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN If we have a regulated brain state, can you imagine you're brain doing the right task at the right time with the right brainwave? I mean, that is such a cool thing. And so, I'm gonna say it again to you. I mean, think about this statement. Can you imagine your brain doing the right task at the right time with the right brainwave? An example of that would be-- and I can use myself as, I supposed, a case study here-- but when you go to bed at night, your delta waves are supposed to be functioning and you're supposed to go to sleep, right? 

00:08:30
What are the common brainwave frequencies? Delta: restorative sleep (0-3 hz) Theta: drowsiness, meditation, daydreaming (4-7hz) Alpha: relaxed focus, cognitive efficiency (8-12 hz) Beta: problem-solving, cognitive activity (13-22hz) 

00:08:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Remind onto that quite. I'm teaching myself how to do that. But that's what the brain is supposed to do. So, when you're listening to this, uhm, therapy talk, you really should be using your beta waves, but if you're out kind of daydreaming then you're probably using theta waves. So again, imagine your brain doing the right task at the right time with the right brainwave. So here's what I want you to just-- this is probably a material you-- many of you aren't open. I just want you to think about this. So, I teach graduate school at Bradley and right now I got to teach undergraduate and graduate students. I am teaching neurofeedback to them. So I came up with this kind of pneumatic to teach about brain waves and it's do think about brain growth. And so you take the first letter of each of those words and I want you to think about delta waves. 

00:09:15
What are the common brainwave frequencies? Delta: restorative sleep (0-3 hz) Theta: drowsiness, meditation, daydreaming (4-7hz) Alpha: relaxed focus, cognitive efficiency (8-12 hz) Beta: problem-solving, cognitive activity (13-22hz) 

00:09:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Now delta waves are these really nice slower waves and that should make you sleepy as we're kind of talking. And, and these are the waves that go about 0 to 3 hertz. And these are the-- is that restore the sleep. You know you have been in really good delta wave when you wake up in the morning and you just feel refreshed. So, then that's delta wave. Then, you move to theta wave which are about 4 to 7 hertz. Theta really I knew-- I know you've been to that theta, ah, state too when you're feeling kind of meditative or you're doing yoga, you might be daydreaming, you're little bit drowsy but you're not in that deep sleep. Uhm, and I know you've experienced that, that brain wave too. I almost hate to admit this, but have you ever been driving and, ah, you-- you're going to some place and you get to the place and you think, "Oh, I don't quite remember how I got here." Well, you were in a state of theta at that point. Can you imagine all of us driving around theta? That's pretty scary. But, anyway, I think that what happens to us a lot. You aren't supposed to be in theta when you're driving. You should be using beta waves. But that's theta waves. So-- and then there's alpha wave. 

00:10:20
What are the common brainwave frequencies? Delta: restorative sleep (0-3 hz) Theta: drowsiness, meditation, daydreaming (4-7hz) Alpha: relaxed focus, cognitive efficiency (8-12 hz) Beta: problem-solving, cognitive activity (13-22hz) 

00:10:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uhm, alpha waves are those about 8 to 12 hertz which means 12 cycles per second. And that's a relaxed focus state. Uhm, it's really idling and preparatory state, and so it helps-- that's the wave that you're supposed to have to help transition to other brain states. And then there's that pro-- the problem state which is the beta waves which are problem-focused awareness kind of things. That's a really long-- a brain wave, uhm, schedule at 13 to about 22 hertz. Twelve to 15 hertz is what you should be using right now. If you have any anxiety, you might be using a little up in the 22 hertz range. And then there's gamma. In gamma, we don't get a lot of it but a lot of times when you just have the aha moment, you're trying to solve a problem and you go, "Oh, yeah! I got it!" That's when you had a, a gamma wave. So those are the kinds of wonderful b-- brainwaves we should be using. And remember we're supposed to be using at the right time with the right task with the right brain wave. So let's do some quickly-- let's talk about some current applications. 

00:11:20
What are some current applications? • ADHD & learning Problems • Anxiety & Depression • Pain Control, PMS, TMJ, CFS, FMS • Migraines & Seizures • Addiction & Trauma • Sleep Disorders • Autism & Aspergers • Performance 

00:11:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I am not asking to become a neurofeedback expert, but I really want you to understand some of these current applications. There are many of them. Uhm, ADHD, learning problems, anxiety, depression, there are pain control, seizures, sleep disorders, I'd already mentioned Aspergers and autism, and of course peak performance. Some of our Olympic athletes were using this for peak performance. 

00:11:45
What are some current applications? • 75% reduction in ADHD symptoms (Lubar, 2003) • Even after medications were discontinue, ADHD patients showed statistical gains three years after EEG NF (Monastra, et alt, 2004) • 80% of ADHD patients treated with NF were able to decrease daily stimulant medication by 50% (Monastra, et alt, 2004) • Increase of 12 IQ points for LD children (Thompson & Thompson, 1998) • 80% sobriety after a four-year follow-up (Saxby & Peniston, 1995) • Only a 20% relapse of panic attacks for veterans with PTSD (Peniston & Kulkosky, 1991) • 70% reduction in epileptic seizures (Sterman & Egner, 2006) • 88% improvement in depression after one year follow-up 

00:11:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN What I need you to know more than anything though is, you know, this is just not a fad and so what I want you to become is a, a real good under-- go and do some research on neurofeedback efficacy ratings. Here are some of the ones that I think are so interesting. Uhm, mostly, the higher efficacy rating comes with neurofeedback with-- children with ADHD. And I just completed some research doing that and I randomly assigned students, young kids, who are on stimulant medication and I randomly assigned them to a treatment group and a control group. They did 40 sessions on neurofeedback and some of them were on stimulant medications. Many of them came after medications because their brain was working efficiently. Now, that is as cool as I think it gets. Getting our children on stimulant medication, I'm, I'm just all for that. And even after the medications were released, 3 years later, some of these students were doing well. 

00:12:35
What are some current applications? • 75% reduction in ADHD symptoms (Lubar, 2003) • Even after medications were discontinue, ADHD patients showed statistical gains three years after EEG NF (Monastra, et alt, 2004) • 80% of ADHD patients treated with NF were able to decrease daily stimulant medication by 50% (Monastra, et alt, 2004) • Increase of 12 IQ points for LD children (Thompson & Thompson, 1998) • 80% sobriety after a four-year follow-up (Saxby & Peniston, 1995) • Only a 20% relapse of panic attacks for veterans with PTSD (Peniston & Kulkosky, 1991) • 70% reduction in epileptic seizures (Sterman & Egner, 2006) • 88% improvement in depression after one year follow-up 

00:12:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN We also found another really fascinating piece I thought. These students, after neurofeedback, could access their default mode in the brain, which just means that's the part of our brain that really talks to us about self-reflection. So how, how wonderful is that? I mean-- and the word I keep using in neurofeedback is remarkable. I have never, in my 3 years of doing counseling, had anything quite as remarkable as neurofeedback. So I want you to get into the literature. There's wonderful things on ADHD. There's some great information on young kids who have learning disabilities after neurofeedback their IQs are being raised 12 points. Ah, I mean, that's unheard of. Probably another one that I find fascinating is the use of, uhm, neurofeedback with people who have had trauma. Veterans-- we were finding that this has been really helpful with veterans and it's also been helpful with sobriety. So, can you imagine if we use neurofeedback in our group work, how efficacious we might be? So, there's some wonderful research findings, but what I want you to be able to go out and do is going to the literature and know that there are efficacy ratings. These are developed by our professional associations, uhm, in neurofeedback and biofeedback, ISNR and AAPB, but they basically just rate our protocols for neurofeedback one which really goes to-- you know, I saw behavior change, it's a level one, it's anecdotal. 

00:14:00
Efficacy Ratings Level 1 - anecdotal results Level 2 - possibly efficacious Level 3 - probably efficacious Level 4 - efficacious Level 5 - efficacious and specific-Proven results through randomized, controlled, blind research (ISNR & AAPB) 

00:14:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN To clear the end of the continuum which talks about I know this is efficacious and I know it's specific, because it's been done multiple times with randomized, controlled, and blind studies. I don't know if you can get any better than that, so get into the literature, reads about those things, see how high the efficacy ratings are, and see if neurofeedback is something that might be helpful to your clients. So here's what I want you to think about. I guess this is a kind of my concluding remarks. All we're doing is teaching clients to do self-regulation. I think that is just incredible. 

00:14:40
Conclusion Any type of self-regulation assists your clients in having more intrinsic locus of control. NFB is another to regulate or modulate the brain. 

00:14:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN By doing self-regulation, what I find happening is that-- then they have a better sense of intrinsic locus of control. I'll, I'll give you an example. I have-- I recently I had a client who, uhm, had lots of trauma in her life and she just kept coming into therapy and saying things like 'I'm a loser, I can't believe I can't understand this stuff,' and she would just have more negative self-talk. And, and rather than things getting better, I didn't see things getting pro-- progressively better. But I began to explain to her about the amygdala in the brain and I said to her, you know, "Do you understand that the amygdala is our flighter-- fight, fight or fight response?" And I said, "Many times with many of us, when we're under trauma constantly," and she kept re-traumatizing herself, '"the amygdala actually grows larger and that in some instance it get-- does get a little bit smaller." But in her case I really think her trauma response was always-- everything she saw, the environment was always based upon trauma. And I began to kind of teach her a little bit about that. And then I also began to teach her some other self-regulation skills such as breathing, all of those things. She, she-- her whole demeanor stopped in therapy and she said, "You mean this is not just because I'm a loser? I have some physiological concerns?" And as we began doing neurofeedback, he whole central nervous system calmed itself down. And so to me, there's nothing better and that's all I'm asking you to do is understand that this is another way that we can go to the source of the problem and help our clients, chronic clients re-regulate and modulate their brain. 

00:16:15
Call to Action Professional: Learn enough about this highly efficacious brain-based intervention to refer chronic clients to a certified neurotherapist. Personal: Begin your own self-regulation course of action to be a healthier clinician be that NFB, exercise or a wellness approach We need to practice what we preach. 

00:16:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN So my takeaway for you today-- and, and I really like this is my call to action to you. And I have a professional call to action and I have a personal call to action. My professional call to action for you is I just want you to learn about it. Again, I don't think you have to go out and get trained in neurofeedback although I has certainly changed how I do therapy. And you can do that if you want. And I, I love neurofeedback. But if you, if you just know about it, you know that it's another brain-based option for our clients especially for the chronic client. For that client I told you about who's been to your office, you're the sixth therapist, they are looking for a missing piece and I really believe this is their missing piece. So, use for that chronic client-- don't be afraid to refer them to a certified neurotherapist. Because the profession is still relatively new, a neurotherapist is not-- they don't have to have licenses. So, at least, if you're gonna make a referral, make sure that you send them to a certified neurofeedback specialist. So that's a part of my professional call to action. 

00:17:20
Call to Action Professional: Learn enough about this highly efficacious brain-based intervention to refer chronic clients to a certified neurotherapist. Personal: Begin your own self-regulation course of action to be a healthier clinician be that NFB, exercise or a wellness approach We need to practice what we preach. 

00:17:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN But my personal one is I'm, I'm kind of begging all of us as counselors and helping professionals to begin your own self-regulation journey. I'm, I'm convinced if we can be healthier clinicians, we have to be healthier too for our clients. And so I think neurofeedback or any other self-regulation technique would be extremely helpful to you as a person as well and as a clinician. So I really appreciate your time today. Uhm, I love neurofeedback. As I said, it's changed how I see the world, it's changed how I do therapy, and I really hope that you'll at least think about becoming a more aware in understanding neurofeedback so you too can take that chronic client and give them the missing piece that they still badly need. Thank you so much.

THERAPY Talks 

00:18:10
SHANNON DERMER Lori, thank you so much - 

00:18:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, you're welcome. 

00:18:15
SHANNON DERMER - for that fascinating talk. 

00:18:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN You're welcome. 

00:18:15
SHANNON DERMER I have lots of questions for you. 

00:18:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh, I, I hope I have the answers. 

00:18:20
SHANNON DERMER So, you said basically everyone has at least some dysregulation - 

00:18:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Absolutely. 

00:18:25
SHANNON DERMER - and so you're helping it just that, so does that make you like a chiropractor for the brain? 

00:18:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, that might be a good analogy. I, I guess, you know, the thing that I probably didn't say though is maybe very quickly why we ha-- or have dysregulated brains? 

00:18:35
SHANNON DERMER Great. 

00:18:35
Lori A. Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:18:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I think we have dysregulated brains because we have lived life and, ah, most of us came out of the room, I think, fairly healthy. And, uhm, as we go through life, things happen. And so perhaps you have a high fever or, you know, I think it's important to even think about our birth. Uhm, were you a forcep baby? You know, did you come out as-- with vacuum? Uhm, what happened to you at birth? So, that make some difference. We could have had genetic predispositions, but lots of things, you know, dysregulate our brain. Maybe you were in a car accident. We have organic brain trauma. So, all those things really dysregulate the brain. This is another way that we can regulate the brain. 

00:19:20
SHANNON DERMER Okay, so you're saying it's pretty much normal that everyone has experiences, uhm, that, that was awful a little bit but that we can drew some feedback and other techniques then get ourselves back regulated? 

00:19:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Absolutely. And what's fascinating on your feedback is that once you have a regulated brain, it will stay regulated and tell the body has another intervention, another sickness perhaps a car wreck or something like that, or substance to be used - 

00:19:45
SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:19:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN - those kinds of things. 

00:19:45
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:19:45
SHANNON DERMER So then, ah, do they have to do-- how does the person know that they're back into dysregulation? Do they have to go back and see you? Do you help them to maintain - 

00:19:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:19:55
SHANNON DERMER - those things? How does that work? 

00:20:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN All right, that's a great question. And-- my, my clients come back and say, "I need a little booster shot." 

00:20:05
SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:20:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And that's not a shot at all. And again, it's not even anything that hurts. But, uhm, I think they began to feel not sufficient. An example I always use in, in classes that-- do you've seen that Claritin commercial where if you take an allergy medicine and if you don't take it you have this fog and there sort of that, I don't know, there's a film (inaudible ) all over your world, but once you take this medicine, the film is lifted and the world is vibrant? 

00:20:30
SHANNON DERMER Uh-huh. 

00:20:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, that's kind of what of happens with neurofeedback. I have clients tell me that-- they say things like, uhm, "I feel better. I just feel more vibrant. I feel just healthier." So, it's the sensation and it's, it's efficiency we-- I mean, you know when your brain is working well and I think that's what people who have, ah, dysregulated brain that then become regulated, they feel better. It's very subtle. You don't take-- you don't have one neurofeedback session and you go, "Oh, life is better." I-- it is really subtle and, and the change comes over time. But, uhm, I find it quite remarkable that people do know when the brain is working efficiently. And then I go back to the, the statement I said, it's amazing when you, when you can use the right brain wave for the right task at the right time, that's pretty phenomenal. 

00:21:15
SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. So, your brains, ah, has got a kind of a toolbox and it's using the right tool at the right time. 

00:21:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Right. And, and I think many times we tend to not use the right tool at the right time. 

00:21:25
SHANNON DERMER Okay, so now you mentioned this a little bit in your talk. Ah, you're not suggesting that, ah, every counselor, therapist, ah, clinicians has to go out there and get trained in neurofeedback. 

00:21:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN No. In fact, I don't think every helping professional wants to do that. It's-- it the-- it's a tab very expensive and it takes a lot of few time. But I want you to know is that there's a tool out there, another tool that we can use as a referral process especially for those chronic clients. 

00:21:55
SHANNON DERMER Okay, now you actually do have a book, if you'd hold that up. 

00:22:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh, thank you. What I think you'll learn in here is a lot about the brain. You'll hear about sources of dysregulation, ways-- neurotherapy ways that we can treat the, the source of dysregulation. There's a lot of physiology in there, too, but it's the kind of physiology that I think that many of us need to know about, ah, even kind of, if I mentioned there, a point of view. 

00:22:20
SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:22:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And, and then I talk about the future, I talk about how you can get trained as a neurofeedback specialist, or just a little bit about just, uhm, I don't know, he-- health in general. So, what I-- why we did this book was one-stop shopping. Honestly, I have searched for this book when I was - 

00:22:35
SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:22:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN - being trained. And so I thought, "Well, if I can't find it, I guess I'll just write it." 

00:22:40
SHANNON DERMER You write it. 

00:22:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN That's right. 

00:22:40
SHANNON DERMER And was your brain regulated when you wrote that? 

00:22:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Ah, let's me think about that. Probably not. Oh, probably not. But it's getting better. 

00:22:45
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:22:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I'm, I'm doing a lot of things for self-regulation. 

00:22:50
SHANNON DERMER Right. And you mentioned that also in your talk that you feel like that is a call to us personally and professionally that we need to regulate ourselves and be as healthy as we can for our clients. 

00:23:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Our clients. Absolutely. 

00:23:05
SHANNON DERMER And so you actually use, uhm, neurofeedback to help regulate yourself? 

00:23:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I have used, I have used a lot of things, neurofeedback and neurotherapy. Neurofeedback falls into this large umbrella of neurotherapy which is anything-- any intervention that we use that's-- for neurorehabilitation, neuromodulation, of which things like exercise would be an example, right? That's one of the ways that we certainly regulate our brains. 

00:23:30
SHANNON DERMER Okay, so let me make sure that I understand that. 

00:23:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:23:30
SHANNON DERMER You're saying neurotherapy is anything that we do that really can, uhm, affect, influence, ah, regulate our brain, and neurofeedback is one particular way we can do that. 

00:23:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Absolutely. 

00:23:40
SHANNON DERMER Okay. 

00:23:40
Lori A. Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:23:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And what I love about neurofeedback though, it is one of the very few sources that goes to the point of the brain where there's the dysfunction or dysregulation, right, and it regulates that through the principles of operant and classical condi-- e-- conditioning. We had been doing changes of behavior for years using those principles. Why not attach them to the source of the problem which is the brain? 

00:24:05
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:24:05
SHANNON DERMER Yeah, and you give, ah, brief example of that. But can you say a little bit more about how you, uhm, suppress some of the problematic brain waves and how you reinforce the ones - 

00:24:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Sure. 

00:24:15
SHANNON DERMER - that should be happening at the-- at particular moment? 

00:24:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And any of that is, is hard to illustrate without really showing you my neurofeedback equipment, uh-hmm, but if you can imagine this, uhm, the cl-- the client is sitting in front of our, our monitor, and let's say I'm just using puzzles, and so the puzzle might be a picture of an iris or flower. And when the brain hits the right brain wave that I know that it needs to hit - 

00:24:40
SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:24:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN - the puzzle is going to unfold and the brain loves to get reinforcement like that. And then when the brain doesn't get that reinforcement, the picture goes away and the brain does not like that. It, it really likes to be stimulated, right? 

00:24:55
SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:24:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And so it's the brain-- we get bored but the brain never gets bored. So it's saying, "Give me more." 

00:25:00
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:25:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN "Give me more." 

00:25:00
SHANNON DERMER So you're truly doing like reinforcement, giving the brain what it likes to see, - 

00:25:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Absolutely. 

00:25:05
SHANNON DERMER - when it's doing what it's supposed to do? 

00:25:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And if you have too much of something, too much theta wave which would be an example of someone with perhaps some ADHD problems, uhm, or perhaps have some depression, if you have too much of something, I'm going to inhibit that - 

00:25:15
SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:25:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN - and I'll do-- and very similarly, I don't like that you have what you want until you hit the threshold that, that the brain needs. 

00:25:25
SHANNON DERMER Okay, and how do you decide if that reinforcement should be visual or auditory because I think you mentioned both? 

00:25:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:25:30
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:25:30
Lori A. Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:25:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uhm, you, you don't-- I don't think it's anything. We decide but we do both. So, for example, I, I love this. For example, if I'm trying to do an auditory and I, I might want the auditory to be inhibit, this is really naughty, but-- so the-- and it hit-- the noise might be-- it could be birds. But I found that - 

00:25:50
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:25:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN - so many people like birds and so they don't wanna hear lovely birds. But I have this part of my software that I can actually change and it will go, oh-oh, oh-oh, and it's really obnoxious oh-oh. 

00:26:00
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:26:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And it's so an-- and it is so annoying that people do not wanna hear it and so they work even harder. Although this is really automatic, but they don't wanna hear that oh-oh, and so they'd rather he-- they'd rather see the picture unfold, or maybe they'd rather hear some nice music. So, it's something that is-- we do in combination with the software. 

00:26:20
SHANNON DERMER Okay, that's fascinating. 

00:26:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN It is fascinating. I-- this is an incredible, incredible intervention. 

00:26:25
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:26:25
SHANNON DERMER Now I am not trained in, uhm, neurofeedback but I have always enjoyed learning things about the brain. And it sounds like in some ways, you educate your clients about the brain, just so they can normalize some of the stuff you're better about some other things that happened to them. 

00:26:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Absolutely. And I, I go, I go back to that. When I was talking earlier about intrinsic lo-- locus of control though, you know, if I can teach someone about feedback technique of skin temperature control, or even how to breath correctly, and they think I can do this, I can do almost anything. I think it, it bolsters their ability to go out to the world and, and conquer their fears. And maybe that sounds too far-reaching, but I don't think it is. 

00:27:10
SHANNON DERMER You know, it sounds like you're saying that learning to regulate your body and your brain gives you a sense of, uhm, power and self-efficacy that you can generalize to other areas. 

00:27:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN That's exactly what this whole thing is. 

00:27:20
SHANNON DERMER Great. Now, ah, we only have a little bit of time - 

00:27:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay. 

00:27:20
SHANNON DERMER - left, but I want to ask you a little bit. You mentioned something, uhm-- if anyone knows anything about infants and children, there's a lot of learning that happens early on - 

00:27:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:27:30
SHANNON DERMER - and the brain is just developing like - 

00:27:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:27:35
SHANNON DERMER - crazy and making connections. But from what you said it's sounds like the environment and the experiences that we have adults can actually affect our brain structure. 

00:27:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh, absolutely, in fact, one of the classes I'm teaching at Bradley is a course on aging and epigenetics. 

00:27:50
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:27:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And not throwing in another whole aspect here, but it does-- you know, we now-- we used to think it was nature versus nurture. You always heard about that. But now we know its nature versus-- its nature and nurture and environment. And so what we do in our environment really impacts our gene expression and I find that fascinating. And so, you know, I'm teaching this class of young kids who are probably in their 20s or 30s and I'm saying, "What you do today makes a difference on how you're gonna be when you're 80." So that's-- I mean, to me that's-- gives me enough empathy to say, "Okay, maybe I should do this anymore." And what you do today impacts your future children. And so everything makes a difference and I would-- I'm hoping that people could learn that and become a bit more intentional. 

00:28:35
SHANNON DERMER Great. So, I wanna thank you for your - 

00:28:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Ah. 

00:28:40
SHANNON DERMER - fascinating talk today. 

00:28:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN It's my pleasure. I'm so happy to be here. 

00:28:40
SHANNON DERMER And I guess what I take away from it, it's, ah, you're never too old to influence your brain. 

00:28:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Absolutely. Never too old, never too old. 

00:28:50
SHANNON DERMER Great. And so for all of you out there, if you are interested in Dr., uhm, Russell-Chapin's ideas, you can look at her book.
