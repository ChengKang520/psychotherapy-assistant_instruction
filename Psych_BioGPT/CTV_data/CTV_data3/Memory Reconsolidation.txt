Memory Reconsolidation by Richard Hill 

00:00:20
RICHARD HILL That's very nice to see you up. The weather report is that the clouds will be closing in, there will be hurricanes, typhoons, very unpleasant sort of people sitting around the pool for I think the next couple of hours. Then it will be fine and you can do what you want. It's not true. But the wonderful when you, sometimes when you go to conferences is someone gets up and introduces you and waxes lyrical about how extraordinary you are and wonderful and I haven't got anyone. So we'll have to wax lyrical about myself. Damn, anyway, I think we pretty much get it. So good morning everybody. My name is Richard Hill. We, as presenters, we always put hings on the slide just so we remember who we are and what we're talking about. I was just discussing where I did a wonderful thing one time where I was halfway through the introduction and someone said is that the, the talk on so and so, and I said oh yes, that's this afternoon's talk. Not to worry the introduction's the same. So you got to, you got to keep on your, on your toes. I'm Richard Hill, I spent the first 25 years deeply studying the nature of human experience and interaction and the, particularly the way limited dialogue is used to express lies and deceit eventually with revelations of truth coming through a great deal of pain and discomfort. I was an actor, so acting taught me more about psychotherapy as an experiential art than anything else cause I learned exactly that. That people use minimal dialogue and they more or less mostly don't know what they're talking about, as what is the real truth and we have to discover this in many ways, and one of the most important things about all this is memory. I decided that I hadn't quite become a famous actor, quite disappointing although I did live off the industry for 25 years which apparently is quite a reasonable achievement, but I went into studies in my forties, linguistics, which always useful idea in counseling, the ACA and the APIC gave me a footing there. I've then got very engaged with the Milton Erikson foundation and Jeff Zeitzberg if you want to speak at the Milton Erikson foundation, you need a Master's Degree. I said I'll go get one of those then, so a lovely friend of mine said come and do this course about social ecology and Stewart actually ended up I discovered that he was the chair of the Western Sydney Social Ecology and that was terrific so I boasted I was invited by the chair but it was actually just my mate Stewart. And then on to education and now I'm completing my studies for a while, I think about 7 or 8 years at univ. is enough. I'm doing the Mind and Brain Sciences Institute Master's Degree at the moment with Bruce Hickey and various people. One of the things that we did whilst doing the course was a program on suicide prevention and I was very fortunate to be called up, you might have met Sue and Shane, they're sitting at the back now because they have to run away, but they said would you like to do a program on suicide prevention. I said, well I actually have one, so there's lots of wonderful things that have gone on and one of the most important things that has been the development is taking an interest in neuroscience and in genetics and in those areas of the important thing: so what does that mean for being a human being? I had an extraordinary expression of this need for people to understand not the, not just the technicalities but what to do with the technicalities in day to day life, when my daughter rang and said, Dad I have something on my brain and oops, good to hear. So I love my girl, but she was also in Beirut at the time, but we had a, I go on which is superficial it's gone very well. She would come back to me and she would ring and she would say, Dad I've got this, it's that, it's this percentage, there's this on the MRI, and this means that and I have to take this medication and then she'd say, so what does that mean? And I would sit there and say, this means you're going to be a little bit cloudy for a few days, you're going to be a little aggressive in the mornings, it means you're going to have this, you're going to do that, it means you're going to have to this and so on and so forth and she said oh, thanks Dad. But I couldn't give that counseling therapeutic advice if I didn't know what was going on in her head on the technical level, so that's why we need to learn. We don't need to learn to sit with our clients and say, I'll just tell you what I know about neuroscience, because some people do. What we do is we sit there and we go, ah, we work it out. It's like an, it's like a, a great driver who sits in a car, knows every workings of the engine and then his feet and hands and body make that car into the wall, do exactly what he wants. We get in the car and oh well, short drive into the wall. You know you scribble, let me read you just a couple of pages of scribblies. I read through this and it was really quite good so I tore them out. We mostly think of changing the difficult emotion problems that are associated with traumatic memories as something that can be achieved over time. We have a couple of terms for this, one is extinction where the conditional stimulus like a bell in the experiments with animals is not longer related to the unconditioned stimulus which is the electric shock, so the severe one, the strong one the shock, the weaker one the bell. And after a series of bells with no shock, the fear response to the bell is said to be extinguished. Unfortunately the association does remain in some ways and can be revived at a later date. Another term we use is systematic desensitization, that might be one you're familiar with, where the emotional distress is reduced gradually, again over time through calming and relaxing processes and various different types of things. You know, imagine yourself now calm, mindfulness practices, meditation practices, lots of things, so the systematic desensitization until the memory no longer stimulates the same distressed emotional response. Equally we do find that at a later date, a further trauma can revive the response so we may not have a direct memory but we have traces. On the other hand, have you ever had a sudden insight, you know the penny drops, where a bunch of different things just suddenly all come together into a connected thought, it's sudden it's immediate and it's permanent. When you had these insights, you haven't sort of gone to the next day and said oh look, I'll just have to review that insight and try and remember and see if I can learn it. It stays and it sticks. Well even more so, how about something that you always thought was true, but you later found it not to be true or very different from what you first thought. Now this kind of revelation changes your memory and any associated emotions with it. Suddenly, immediately and permanently, you have a change. This is an example of memory reconsolidation. We've been doing it for a long time. It's been existent in our practice. We just haven't understood it in the same way that brain plasticity is now something that is new in the sense that now we understand it, well it's new for the last 15 years or so, but it actually started talking about in the 60s. But people have been having strokes for centuries and recovering movement and recovering speech and having brain plasticity but no one named it, pointed it out, or saw the connection. Again, an insight, a revelation, once we got it we never go back. It's permanent. So without this inbuilt capacity to change our memories and change the nature of the way our memories associate to all the other things that we do our emotional behavior particularly, without that we would become hopelessly confused. If everything we thought initially was a good idea at the time had to compete with a correction that we learned through experience, we would be like Jekyll and Hyde, we'd never be sure of what was true and what is best. That's the sort of rubbish I write in notes. But that's right, that's good, I extracted that, that was all in the preparation over the last six months in doing things. It's about our natural biological capacity to alter our perceptions, our understandings and our awarenesses in a permanent way so that we can proceed forward in a better, in a better state. What we have understood in psychotherapy is, what we have found in psychotherapy, CBT, with mindfulness, with this and that and the other thing, is that we can do it over time and hopefully we can do it, they don't, they don't fall back into the same problems, but they sometimes do. But again we've done this forever. We have CBT, we have any of dozens of the practices we do. Some patients kind of just get it and it just bang, they're solved and it never happens again. Others it goes on week after week after week. And there are reasons for that because memory reconsolidation occurs within frameworks, within time frames and it's biochemically organized and so if you don't do it in a particular way, then it doesn't happen and then extinction and systematic, that other thing that I, desensitization, long word, too long for this early in the morning. So let's look at memory reconsolidation. And that's going well so far and we'll go that one. I knew it was the other one. So why do we remember and why do we forget. There's a little bit of that in what I've said in the initial bit so we don't need to spend too much time on this because we remember for all kinds of interesting reasons but one of the main reasons we remember is because we need to prepare ourselves for the future. So memory is a part of our preparation for future systems and we have a whole bunch of them. I just written an interesting article for the Gaines Journal in the US on this very process and there are extraordinary things that our body does, everything from overt things like memory down to very fine biochemical responses and reactions that are only there for the future, to help us in the future and help us survive. Forgetting is a very important thing because not everything is necessary to remember. We have also a lot of things are not even stored in long term memory. We were hearing a little bit about zif 268 yesterday, one of the ways in which you can tell whether somebody is finding meaningful experience is to look at their zif 268 expression in the night and if they have no zif 268 then we start to look at the fact that they just don't have, don't care about anything and their body doesn't care about anything and they're very, we have problems with their sense of association and connection, but when it matters, we remember it. Sometimes we remember things that we wish we couldn't remember but it matters to us on many levels because our conscious desire is not our whole system. In fact it's a very, very small part and some people quite reasonably argue that our consciousness is merely a, an observer of everything else and that it happens about a half, between a third to a half a second after everything else happens and we just go, oh yes, so consciousness actually doesn't do anything, although I think I'm more in the school where consciousness, the sense of mind, the sense of being or becoming aware, actually works in a dynamic cycle, so that not only does, we come, we go inwards to our mind but also our mind comes downwards into our biology and changes us so we have a bidirectional process. So sometimes we try to forget and we really can't. Somebody's having PTSD, they don't want to have PTSD, they don't want to remember this stuff, they don't want to hear a car backfire and find themselves on the ground you know defending themselves against pretend military situations or various things, they don't want to see somebody who looks like a big shadow man and suddenly quiver from the fear of sexual problems that they had in youth. We don't want to remember them but we do because that protects us and until we have something that allows us to truly believe that we are safe, we are going to remember those dangers and we're going to remember those problems. I keep pressing the wrong button, there we go. So we have these two things, explicit and implicit memories. Simplest way to define this without going into a long, complicated description is just explicit memory is that memory which we are able to access consciously and reflect on so we can say, so we can think about our thinking, is explicit memory. Implicit memory are all those areas that are not conscious, that are not available for our sense of reflective awareness. Mostly this is in language but it also can be emotional, we can be emotionally aware of our emotions but very rapidly it tends to move into language but some people who don't have language still have that conscious awareness through other aspects but it's something that goes on without our awareness and our reflectiveness and our sense of control of it. Memory's complex. This is what's so wonderful, brilliant. Let's, so if you had a, if you had a design and said well let's put memory there and we'll put movement there and we'll put that there and that'll be really good and everyone will know where everything is, very organized, but then of course if anything goes wrong with there, then of course you're completely stuffed so memory is all over the place in all aspects. It's divided up and when we actually recall things, we recall things in parts, we recall things in segments and in sections. Even, even a specific thing like a face, is recalled in parts, and sort of facial hair is recalled in a slightly different place to eyes, recalled to a slightly different place to smiles and so on and so forth. So we have the capacity to manage ourselves, maintain our forward movement through life with the preparation and advance of experience without having to know everything at any given time. So we are triggered by enough, never by all, and as you can see... I've got a different clicker, this is why, we have memory, we have clarity this, more the explicit memory goes down to facts and events which is called semantic or episodic and it's mainly up in the frontal lobes and in the cortex area, the temporal and in the medial prefrontal. We get non-declarative or the implicit areas and that goes for procedural skills, those inhabit the striatum. Also we get some of those behavioral things going into the cerebellum, priming and perception in the neocortex, you have emotional responses in the amygdala, skeletal responses in the biophysical, you know how to drive, how to do some of those things, in the cerebellum, and then you have reflexive pathways as well and that's another complexity when we look at the peripheral nervous system and the memory systems the way it works in preparing yourself to rip your hand off the hot stove. It's a reflexive action but it's a memory. We have a system which goes through and says, this is what you need to do when this stimulus arrives, and I want you to do it a lot quicker than sending it up to the brain and the brain working it out. So even the reflexive system can be considered to have memory capacities, preparation for the future. If I'm being a bit bold and expanding out into the broader aspects. So how do we remember? In the explicit and the implicit, we use a bunch of different systems. The neuronal and the neural, so neuronal in the head, the neural in the peripheral system. If you, Chinese water torture, you know that if you drip on the thing, you'll eventually drive them crazy, but the essence of this is that you do this, you will begin to stimulate that area, that area will become noticeable, the body will say I need to notice this, I need to remember this, I need to pay attention to this, and it will grow neuronal clusters, it will grow clusters of receptors in that area so that they then become heightened and it becomes a place of heightened awareness such so that after doing that just for ten seconds, that now is a more sensitive area than elsewhere, but I can make it permanent over a period of time. So that's just a quick, neuronal ones we're pretty aware of some of that. I'll talk about that a little bit more. We learn biologically through, through various areas. We seem to store memories, memories are associated with biological constructions. So not only do we have the timing of a memory occurring here, a trauma occurring in our brain which we. we log into but our body is in a certain state at that time and at that time, that state that the body is in actually is related to that memory so we might have a liver condition, we might have had a cut on our arm, we might have had a particular muscle that we didn't even know was, was being noticed and that time, was particularly noticeable, and then later on, you might find you're sitting somewhere and you're talking to someone and you put your hand on their arm and they go, oh, like this, and they suddenly have a flashback of, of something and you've touched their scar of the wound that was happening when, and it's triggered everything, so we have biological memories. We are, and as I say quite often as I talk to massage therapists as well, I say this thing is hollow and it's connected, which sometimes is a surprise to people. They work together and the biochemical, we're now going down to things that go on in cells, things that go on all the way down to the DNA, and we won't spend a lot of time on it. We have a little bit of talk yesterday about epigenetics which is the biochemical overlay of our DNA to prepare our DNA for future experience to remember what to express and what not to express. Now we have a very natural form of that and a very biologically sensible one and that's in the process of differentiation, so we will have cells that differentiate to the liver. Then we will get an epigenetic overlay that turns off everything in that cell, remembering that the DNA does everything, but it turns off everything that isn't liver so that when it reproduces, it reproduces as a liver cell. So this is the way we do it, we do it biologically, but when you have a disturbance, when you have issues of environmental concern, of personal safety, these are also recorded epigenetically on our DNA which encourage certain genes to be expressed or not be expressed in the future and able to assist your capacity to survive 'cause that's the point. Get to, get to bonking and then we're not so much worried about you but pretty much up to there is really important, so a lot of work is done to keep up functionally effective and desirable and able to survive in the world up into our mid-twenties. Then things start to change. So how do these things express themselves? So if consciousness isn't such a big deal and it maybe really is just as an observer, what is an observer of, what are all these in, how do these implicit aspects of memory represent themselves? Well they represent themselves through the things that we deal with, This is what we work with, we look at people's behavior. We look at their affect, the mood, their emotional responses, we look at their personality, A because of the nature of it to get an understanding of them so but B changes in that personality and particularly when someone comes along and says I want you, in marriage counseling and they say, he or she is just not like they used to be. Their personality has changed, and that can be for a lot of reasons. Memory is one of them, of course then you have other biological issues of psychopathologies which can be problematic as well. Your temperament which is slightly different than your personality, this is your tendency of the nature of the way you approach the world and your sense of wellness particularly pain. If there is a single thing that is designed to bring our awareness of needing to do something, it is pain and what is most fascinating in the work of Lieberman and Isenberg in the early 2000's is that they discovered that the anterior singular, the little area just down in here, the back of the prefrontal cortex, the area of social rejection, if you're socially rejected, these areas light up in the anterior singlet but if they give them pain, the same areas light up. So isn't that fascinating? We have learned evolutionary to biochemically relate social rejection and pain so that we remember to take an action when we have social rejection because back when we were evolving, social rejection meant you went out into the, the fields, had no support and possibly died. Certainly your children probably did. So these aspects of what we deal with when we have people in pain could be anything. Pain comes from almost everything and it's referred pain, it's direct pain, it's associated pain, but it most importantly is a trigger of attention. Please somebody do something about this pain, and unfortunately we have a culture which says here's something that dulls the pain. Better now? No. So altering memory, quite a thing, we got to keep ourselves ticking along here.

UNKNOWN Are the introduction slides all on the disk? 

00:23:10
RICHARD HILL They're not on the disk because I've sort of taken a little while to prepare them but I've got my email at the end of this and everyone can email and have those sent in. If you do have questions along the way, there is a microphone that's, that can be brought to you and you can say, Richard, what's that, which is fine, you know, do. So remembering and re-remembering is a part of our natural process. We remember and re-remember all the time and then as Rosse, my fabulous friend and mentor, says and has been saying for decades, every recall is a reframe, every time we remember something, we're having the opportunity to work on that memory, do something to that memory, hopefully improve it, and then hopefully we restore it. What happens is a lot with particularly people with things like PTSD and other traumas is they remember, the memory is reinforced, and it's actually the belief is reinforced because there's the distress and when it is remembered or what I call reconsolidated, it goes back the same and even worse sometimes. This is why it's possible to implant memories, implant associations, implant things because it becomes plastic. We didn't know this but now we do. Extinction, what we do is we create a competing preference, we can paint a better idea and so what is it that you believe now, can't you see that that idea is not a good idea, isn't this a much better idea? And that if you do over time and if people find that the new idea makes them feel better, they have less pain particularly, they will then adopt that idea and they will continue it and then you will have this long term potentiation and you will create a stronger pathway of response to the new idea and the old idea will wither and be less effective although unfortunately it doesn't disappear and there are traces and a later trauma can do this. We see this particularly in phobias where a phobia can be cured and 20 years later, another trauma comes back and it maybe can even be dissociated and the brain just lights up everything that's to do with trauma and phobias come back, particularly phobias that are an emotional illness issues that are related to illnesses and bodily things like asthma, lungs and heart and liver so suddenly you'll find someone asthmatic and you'll find that is a, almost a phobic recall. There are a lot of complexities but that's just a little example of how you don't just think on the thing, you look at everywhere, wow what am I getting, what am I getting, oh look they're getting a few skin complaints, what's going on here, I wonder what the circle and the cycle is. It may be simple but I wonder if it's more complex. Reconsolidation however is the reframing by a protein synthesis and it changes the associations, so extinction which is done over time and in a particular time frame work makes a better idea. Reconsolidation which is done in a different time frame actually changes the nature of the neoronal pathways, changes the associations, changes the relationships permanently. That's what we now know, and the guy who did this experiment and started to really incline us to believe this was Joseph Flido. I could talk about his stuff but I wandered around the whole thing, web, and I found him talking about it, so let's just have three minutes of Joseph Flido and talking in his team about how this works, whiy it's different from extinction. 

00:27:00
[sil.] 

00:27:10
RICHARD HILL That's really the description. It, I couldn't do it better than that and coming from the horse's mouth so Joseph Flido is one of the most people we should be so grateful for, Daniel Gallman's work on emotional intelligence all founded on Joseph Flido's work and as I described this once to Lou Cosaleno, I said it's all based on Flido's work and Lou just said, yea Gallman's a better marketer isn't he. And he was but it was a good idea, he brought the idea more readily to us. But just, just reviewing that aspect, an experience, a memory about a tone and a shock, they changed it, they made it new, they said this is different, this is not the same as before, this isn't what you believed, you know, because this becomes a belief because it's history. So this isn't what you believe anymore. Then when they played the tone, a lot of them just didn't get bothered by it. I mean, there was some traces, it's only a very short experiment but what they were doing was seeing, wow and it's to do with the fact that the, the memory formation which comes through protein synthesis, so gene expression, changed because what they did was they blocked gene expression, so this, these experiments, they actually blocked gene expression and they used on this one a thing called enicomyocin which is really great, it blocks gene expression but then also sends everything else to mush. So it's not actually a really good idea in humans but it gave us that idea and the most important one that they said, you know when they, the one, the rats that they actually played the same tone and shock to and they gave them the drug, they still had the memory, they needed to be new, if it's, if it hasn't got a new thing, it'll go back to where it was. So it needs something new and it needs it in a short time frame. I say it in here elsewhere, but I'll say it again. It's within the first five hours you need to have this and in fact really specifically in some of the experiments it's in the first hour and in the third to the fifth hour so then might even be a gene expression process that goes on in the first hour, hour and a half, then there's actually a pause and then there's a review or refresh of that in the third to fifth hour, so we're still learning exactly how that, that works but it is in that first four or five hours, so what happens is we tend to do things, here's your homework, go home and do that at home. That actually is why a CBT more often than not is about extinction, because they're doing the process later on when the memory is not, is not laibile, that's the term, L A I B I L E, where it becomes laibile again. But sometimes they go home and before they do their homework, they remember the incident, they become laibile, becomes fertile, the new information comes in and they actually do memory reconsolidation, they come back saying, oh that was a great week, everything was really quick, I just did that once and for the rest of the week I was terrific. That's probably the difference. I mean, that's very simplistic expression description but you get what I mean. So the new information, protein synthesis and it's time sensitive. I'm time sensitive and we're doing okay. I'm not going to go over a great deal, I want you to see the biochemistry. I don't want you to necessarily have to recite it afterwards but I want you to at least see it. So what happens, we have an axon coming down to a presynaptic cell and we have these little vesicles in here which have stuff in them and that stuff is created by the cell body through protein synthesis, through gene expression and there's whole bunch of different types. We've only just go the one here just for this very simple example but everything is there, there are dozens of them. Do go in and have a look at it because the vesicles being carried down the axon by those little things that walk along, it's really very cute, but just check that out. But glutamate goes in there, then we have a set of receptors that pick up these, these particular, there's information that comes in, the biochemical information, the receptors that then change the polarization of the postsynaptic cell and is usually by these, these, glutamate comes in, we trigger what's called the amp here, amp up first and sodium comes in, changes the polarization, we then pop out a what's called a magnesium plug and then calcium comes in and everything starts to go and we start to get an action potential. That's a very simplistic thing, so stuff comes in, then that process triggers a responsive activity which moves down through a variety of chemicals and bits and pieces of maps, gene expression. Then gene expression is then what triggers capacities for future memory particularly and future creations and future constructions of chemicals that are useful in that axon in that synaptic pathway. So that's, that's just enough. You just see stuff comes, stuff goes out, gets picked up, it excites it, gets it excited, makes genes. But just to show you that there are pictures with other things, so there's, there's other glutamate ones there but here's a thing called norepinephrine, now norepinephrine is really important because that's a stimulatory process, that's an exciting, that's an idea, it's associated a lot with divenergic pathways, it actually makes you aware and makes you, tends to make you awake and heightens the perception and the consciousness, sorry, the non-conscious, the implicit awareness in the biology, and so you have, equally you have receptors for norepinephrine so when you've got those adronergic receptors are really cool to get the message through. Now what would be really handy and what they found is a really useful idea is if you block this adronergic receptor, if you can get a blocker, an antagonist and stop that, well then that actually has some effect and it tends to stop the gene expression, the pathway of gene expression going through, so initially they would do this with just some enicomyocin which just ups everything, just ups the DNA producing and so the whole mass falls apart. But they found that they could get his beta blocker that would actually stop things happening. That's just a little bit more complicated for those of you when you get it later but just showing how it goes down and you can see some of these zif 268s and various gene expression that goes on and if you could just interrupt with the energetic flow of that and the neurolurgic chemicals are ones that assist in that stimulation so we can block those so that was something that we found that was possible to do with humans, so that was interesting. Now here is just a few quick papers which you probably don't want to, I just want to show you and again just email me and get the, get the powerpoint and you can get these so this is, I think it's always useful, I'm saying things rather simply but actually you can go in and get that from what I've said, that's enough for the average, for the average practitioner but if you want to go deeper, please do. So again remember extinction is a competing preference, it's something that occurs after the fact and it's seeks to create new neuronal pathways. Reconsolidation is reframing the protein synthesis within the neuronal pathway that exists and changing the associations later on and the ones, maybe you have the strong signal and the weak signals so the strong signal which is the pain and the weak signal which is the emotional response you have associated with it. Now this is just a look at the experiments that were done using a beta blocker. They used a chemical called proprenanol and if we could just have a little look at that. For people that actually looked as though they didn't have a chance.

00:35:35
RICHARD HILL Okay, to tone it down, was what he was saying, to tone it down, to change its relationship and that's what's important in this aspect of memory reconsolidation. We're not talking about removing the memory and I think this is where people get very disturbed. Oh my god we're tinkering with people's memories, and I certainly wouldn't like to see practices or drugs or things developed that actually made the memories go away because those memories of our past experience are the things that we use to give us wisdom for the future. But it is as he said that it just is fresh, it stays fresh because it's so, because every time that memory comes, it revives, it restimulates those same emotional disturbances and it becomes reconsolidated as a, as an emotional disturbance of now, and what we're trying to do in PTSD is something, this was an experience of then, and you no longer need to have this emotional response to it now. Now in the context of using something like a drug to help, that, that helps and this is worked on Canada, look this up, it's quite well, well seen and it's with very, very difficult cases but what are they doing that is making new information? Well I think on of the most obvious ones to me is they write down their trauma and what the process is that each time that they go in for the drug, the drug treatment, they read the, the piece. That's to revive, to revive the trauma but they don't speak it, they read it so here I have created a new focus because if it's written down on a piece of paper and I'm reading it, it has to have happened yesterday. It has to not be happening now. So this actually, I think, I suggest is actually one of the, and I know some other people suggested as well but we don't really have firm research evidence on that, but I suggest that's one of things that we're doing to be a new information that's coming through, so how do we work without using drugs that make your brain go to mush or propranolol and labs and things because we're not psychiatrists, we don't have those sorts of things. Can we actually do this, can we actually destimulate or deorganize the protein synth- or reorganize the protein synthesis in the reconsolidation of the memory just through therapeutic talk therapy or one on one interpersonal therapeutic processes, and we think the answer is yes. It's perhaps not as dramatic and perhaps not as, as broad in its percentage of success, but it is very broad. We are able to bring the new information and that new information in itself will shift the, the protein synthesis and the associations that are made and if we do that in a framework of within the five hours of giving a revival of the memory, a safe revival of the memory, then we are moving towards changing the associations and removing the disturbance permanently and completely. Bruce Ecker is one of the most important people around the world doing this, doing this stuff and he's a colleague. We work together, this is our Mind Science tv interview if you go into the Mind Science tv, I'll give the website at the end there, you can see his interview. This book, I think there are a few in the bookshop, if anyone's bought that, you did good. Unlocking the emotional brain, coherence therapy. He's just put online, he sent me an email day before yesterday and said, oh Richard we just put this FAQ on, the frequently asked questions thing on the, on the webpage, and I said, oh I'll put on the, I'll put it on and Americans find it quite surprising when people like Australians say, I'll tell them about you. They find that quite surprising, apparently it's not common for us to share. We should, but it's not as common as it should be. So changing the associations and what Bruce calls disconfirming the knowledge. So there's a new information, there's a new concept, there's a new perception, there's a new affective response, a new behavior, a new experiential perception. I'm saying it's not just verbal, there's not just sort of here's your idea, here's a better one. It could be semantic therapy, it could be something you do with exercise, it could be coupled with all sorts of things. All you need to do, be focusing on is creating a new and preferential perception, similar to what we were doing in CBT some, in some ways with the ideas. But a truth that they can then believe is new and in the context of the neurochemistry being laibile, being able to change its associations, it does that action. Does it do it on the first treatment? Wouldn't that be nice, and sometimes it does. Does it take a while? Maybe it does because you need to, in some ways you're not tricking the brain into reforming itself but you're convincing the brain that it no longer needs to be protectively prepared for this experience to happen again and sometimes deep traumas no one ever wants to feel safe again, but these processes of memory reconsolidation are improving our capacity to shift it. So when you prepare, it's like good therapy. We've got about ten minutes here, should be good. Standard sort of therapy, you sit there, you talk to them, you engage, you identify the symptom, then as you go through and this might take you a session or two or three or four depending on the nature of the client, you then need to identify you know what is the target learning, what makes this true, what, where did this come from, because sometimes what we do and we know with CBT and some of our other process, we actually have to try a whole bunch of different things until we actually find out what the direct link is because there's a whole bunch of things that it looks like it could be and how many of you have had a client where six weeks in, everybody, both of you go oh I see what it is, we were thinking it was that, we were thinking it was that, we were looking for that, it's that. I always love the phobia of the guy who could only wear braces to hold his trousers up, and after some time of fiddling about, it's not my case, it's another case, but after some time of fiddling about, they found that when he was two, one and two, they had a dog, big sort of bulldoggy type thing and the family thought that because no one thought because they had this dog and the baby loved each other, it was a wonderful gorgeous relationship, always playing and doing bits and pieces, and finally the memories came out that the dog wold sometimes smother the child and really be on it, be too much, the dog, what was right in front of the baby's face was the leather collar of the dog and this over time became, because it didn't make sense that the dog was the upset because I love the dog but over time, leather, other things, belts, suddenly he wakes up as an adult and cannot put a belt on and can only wear braces. So took a while to actually get back to the actual trace. So you could have been doing reconsolidation on Daddy smacking you or teachers who were this and all kinds of stuff and not have an affect. So that sometimes does take a bit of time to find the actual direct relationship that's going on. Then it's to identify the disconfirming knowledge and of course in that case with the dog, it was well do you know the dog loved you and you know it was an accident and what's more important, you know that you didn't smother, you know that you survived and through a bit of those, ah yes, so leather, belt, dogs, I'm surviving, new truth, new examples, and reconsolidation enables that to change and make that memory, that current emotional association disappear. So in therapeutic transformation, you recall, so now you've worked that out, now the therapeutic process, recall, return to a laibile state. Now here's where it's difficult because we don't just want to recall a traumatic memory because that can just re-traumatize so we want to use mechanisms where we can recall safely. Now there are lots of ways in which we know how to that in various things. Hypnosis is, hypnotic focused attention, things, mindfulness processes. I'll talk briefly about something with Ernie Rossie that we do, bringing it up so that, saying yea I know your anxiety and your problems as a scale of ten. When it gets to three, tell me to stop so maybe that's enough. You know, you bring up safety levels so that's very important that you don't re-traumatize when you're bringing it in. A lot of times we externalize, put it outside here into a sand tray, put it outside here into a card, and write it down on a piece of paper. It's another externalizing mechanism and as they can't write it each time, you might be able to increase the capacity for them to write. You recall, you activate the new info, the mismatch, sometimes what you can do with a client is when you do that mismatch, that little thing, my dog loved me, I never was smothered, it was fearful then but it'snot fearful now, now I can wear, now I can wear a leather belt. You put down, you get a little card on that, so every time this fear comes up, every time you find yourself freaking out, read your card. So that's a really good thing so when between the homework is when the disturbance arises, check in to the mismatch and a little card is a useful way of doing this. It's one of the things that Bruce uses effectively, and then you repeat it because particularly essentially the longer and the deeper the, the memory is and the more disturbing the memory is, the harder it is to shift or dislodge, largely because the body, you have to convince it to trust this new relationship with the world and that can be very difficult. Some people hold onto memories very reasonably so we need to work quietly and carefully and patiently and look for percentages of change, small shifts. Someone comes in, I say what happened now, you had that recall and they said I did this and this and this but I didn't do that, and you go ah okay so we've, we've reconsolidated that particular one elsewhere, so maybe a single post traumatic situation has got a dozen emotional pathways and you need to work on each one of them independently. Sometimes it can be just an instant action. Now I put that there because you can look at it later but that's what's called the NLP Fast Phobia Cure and it's also used in PTSD and what they do is they do an externalizing, imagine yourself in a movie theater, imagine yourself watching a movie, imagine that movie that you're watching to be the thing that, you're safe in your comfortable, just before one of your disturbing events. Now imagine yourself coming out of your body and going up into the projection room and now you're looking down on you in the theater looking at the screening of you on the screen. Now watch the, the, play the movie and play the disturbing one of your disturbing accidents. You see the removal, that distancing from, and then they do a process where you go back down, you get in, and you put yourself in the film and you run it backwards. So the new information is they, they mismatch it, they disconcert it, and it's enormously effective and in phobias it can be almost instantaneous and permanent but it's memory reconsolidation that it's using. Ernie Rossi's mirror hands. I don't know if of you are familiar with that but it's difficult. Not many people really teach it but I, I'm hyped to bring more of it because I'm, Ernie says I can, you know. Ernie gives me permission and he doesn't do that lightly so but what he does is he puts the energy out into the hand, so we put the negative energy here and a positive energy here but external and let's them, let's them work on, very little dialogue in that sort of process. We do that in hypnotherapy, I've got some wonderful hypnotherapist friends of mine and you do things and you place things in different areas. Let's place the problem in the book, let's place the problem here and blah blah blah, that are very good processes. And the disconfirming mismatches, so the dialogue, so when we write things on a card, but we must look at the nature of play. If you can get people to be playful and for those who attended my workshop yesterday, when we're doing the ovatry mind maps, you can imagine that if we're dealing with a particular trauma, that that mismatch of the almost fun playful engagement with the, with the issues, can be a memory reconsolidating process. It, it may not because we're not working with a particular drug or a particular thing that we can rely on, we are inclining and suggesting and wishing and encouraging the gene expression to alter, the protein synthesis to change so it's not quite as precious and as demanding but change their diet and exercise, make them healthier. Maybe one of the, one of the things, change their body state because there's another one of Ernie's things, state dependent memory learning and behavior. People often with, with PTSD, what is the thing, they don't remember it all the time, they remember it when something happens which puts them back in the state of where they were, so sometimes changing the body state and saying look, yes because one of the things that we know that we do is that we put on weight in relation because we eat carbs because they give us lovely serotonin as it goes through the various processes and that sometimes can be, so we take that off. If we do that and say now look, now takes a little, it's a longer process but now the new information is that you're no longer protecting yourself or needing to protect yourself, your wait is clear, now we do this. So these processes, now you're healthy, now you're fit, now you've gone to the doctor and you've had that particular problem with your heart cur-, resolved. All these different things, anything that changes the state that we can use as a trigger to say you're in a new piece of information, in relation to those disturbing experience 'cause if we just do it broadly, then it's just extinction. Mindfulness, meditation, self development even. Someone can have a realization of personal development, and that can have a memory reconsolidation effect on some of their negative affective disorders, particularly when we're talking about negative issues that are related to attachment. It can be quite fascinating when they have self realization and self love and so we have the, the very simple thing, the tapping the EFT which has actually got some really interesting papers on it, Dorson Church has been doing some very interesting things, but basically says even though I do this thing I absolutely and completely love myself. Now the point of what they're saying there is that is new information. So 'cause we don't and not many people love themselves and we have a lot of things that's, now quick plug, the book How the Real World is Driving Us Crazy, we've got a few copies around, I bet also on the web, and it's also on PDF you can download it, is how we change our mindset from being a self expansive developing person moving through challenges to being a self competing element that is trying to live up to external expectations, and this changes the brain, and I'm suggesting it's actually a mindset that is one of the elephants in the room of all these processes and sometimes we can just change that. Put you back in your center and that is the new information you need to know that you can no longer be harmed. Extinction, competing, okay I get it, and sometimes that's the only way we can do it. Reconsolidation, if you can get the process working and understand there's time frame in the context of the trauma where the trauma is not so great that it is re-traumatizing, then you can change it permanently suddenly and excellently. There's my email. richhill at iinet.net.au, my website mindscienceinstitute.com Bruce's conherencetherapy.org, Book how the real world is driving us crazy, I'm Richard Hill, that's reconsolidation, we have almost no time for questions I'm afraid. Please talk to me afterwards. I think now there's actually been a lot of information, a lot of ideas, I've had a certain repetitiveness going through but I think that's necessary. It's sort of, it's a concept that you go uh, yea, uh, yea, that's fine. Work through it, it's different, it's new but it's just the same as brain plasticity. We have memory replas-, memory plasticity. And it is a wonderful thing and I leave you with you, your traumas and your clients. Thank you.
