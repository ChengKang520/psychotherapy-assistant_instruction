Reflections on Family Therapy 

00:00:55
Salvador Minuchin, MD 

00:00:55
UNKNOWN So I think you're going to have that kind of an experience with Sal Minuchin. You are incredibly privileged. Sal is a wizard, genius at doing psychotherapy, one of the fathers of family therapy. And I can say it gives me great pleasure, emotional pleasure, to introduce you to Sal Minuchin. 

00:01:20
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN Okay. 

00:01:25

00:01:25
SALVADOR MINUCHIN Okay. I want to -- can you hear me? Okay. Uh, George Burns, an American comedian, said on his hundredth birthday that the first 100 years are the difficult ones; from then on, it goes on. So, since I am 80 years -- 88 years old, I have 12 more years of heavy lifting. 

00:02:05
[sil.] 

00:02:05
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN  Really, Tim Beck has also this next 12 years of heavy lifting. Now, I started family therapy in 1958, and that was two years after Don Jackson, in a paper called "On Family Homeostasis", stated that the individual alone did not exist. He says it was created by erasing the connections between the individual and his significant others. And that was a broad side to the psychoanalytic approach that was correct in 1952, and it is correct now in the twenty-first century, and certainly in this conference. I believe, with Don Jackson, that the individual alone does not exist. But, for instance, Tim was talking today about two soldiers who had the same symptom. They go home. One of them fails and the other one succeeds. And I would ask Tim 'What about the families of these two soldiers?' And it is an interesting thing because we are dealing here with -- all the people that are speaking here are extremely bright people and people that have a tremendous amount of experience. But we are in some kind of a box. And so my box is family therapy, so I should not understand Tim Beck, though we were together at Philadelphia at the university and we played poker sometimes together. But -- but we have a box, and my box is family therapy, and Tim's box is cognitive therapy, and therefore we are not connecting. In -- in the last two days, I took the trip of attending a conference of Imago techniques. I attended the conference today of Sue Johnson and then of the -- of the Gottman people. And I was enjoying it because I agree with a tremendous amount of things about them, what they were doing, and also I disagree with them. So I was having a good time, because if I can enjoy something, I can be critical. I cannot be critical unless I have a sense of communion, a sense of contact, and so on. Now, in preparing this conference, I was thinking that family therapy started 58 -- 58 years ago for me. And there is 61 years of family therapy, so we are almost twins. We have almost lived the same time together; so that I could talk about my life experience and draw conclusions that are related to the evolvement of the field of family therapy. Of course like any memories, time has arranged and edited my experience. And what seems clear to me now is actually the product of repetitions. Events that first occurred outside of my awareness, leaving just a shadow or a vague feeling, came back later as a discovery and with a better sense of what it means. I have a tremendous number of certainties. As a therapist, for instance, my ideas and points of focus kept changing over the years. But it's quite recently that I can see and describe the evolution of my thinking. I see now that during my early years of practice as an individual therapist and as an analyst, I gave preeminence to my experiences as a child and thought that the roots of behavior lie in childhood and they could be understood better by exploring childhood. During the decade of the '60s, however, when I was doing family therapy, my focus fell on the present and I saw the past as an inconvenient period that disturbed my understanding of conflictual relationships in the present. One or two decades later - now - I have changed again. By then -- by now, I feel comfortable with the concept of multiple identities born at different periods of one's life, and with the idea of co-existing responses to the demands of life. There has been other more recent developments as well. But let me go back to my story and start it with my early years as a family therapist. I begin with my work at Wiltwyck in the '50s. The '50s was an interesting period. In psychiatry, the '50s was a period in which we hate families, but -- but mostly we hate mothers. Frieda Fromm-Reichmann coined the phrase "schizophrenogenic mother". David Levy talks equally about the mother that was psychogenetic. And it was in this period that family therapy started. And it started; of course, with a similar bias: The family therapy in the '60s was anti-family. If you think about Bateson's, uh, double bind, that was anti-family. Bowen's ideas of the undifferentiated ego-self was anti-family. Minuchin's ideas about the enmeshed family was anti-family. We started with a bias of the '60s. Now, how did I start family therapy? I was working at Wiltwyck, a family institution for delinquent children whose families were in Harlem, where the institution was, um, 200 miles from their families. We were working with a team of 100 children referred to residence by the judicial system of New York. The majority were Afro-American and Latino, and almost all the families were on welfare. This school Wiltwyck was located at a significant distance from New York, so that the children could be free from the pathological influence of their families. Wiltwyck was similar to thousands of such schools around the country, and the experience of the children was typical: They accommodated to the rules of the institution and, after a year or so, they would leave improved. They were discharged, returned to their previous environment, and in large number they came back to the institution, our facilities. We knew that we need a more -- a more effective intervention. And to the group of liberal concerns was treatment at Wiltwyck: Dick Auerswald, Charlie King, Montalvo, myself and others. Jackson's article seemed like a great jumping-off place for exploring a different process. We declared ourselves family therapists. We had read one article. We tore a hole in a wall, we built a wall with mirrors, and invited families and their children to come in for an interview. It was the first time we had seen families. We didn't know how to talk with them, we were floundering, and we developed a three-stage session. We had some hypotheses that I will tell you later. And following the hypotheses, we developed a three-stage session. First, two therapists met with the family for about half an hour. Then one therapist went to the parents, and the other therapists went to the children. They spent half an hour together, and then they reconvened the whole family and the two therapists. What did we learn? Well, after this session we run to behind the one-way mirror where our -- the rest of the team was there, and we said to them 'What did they do, and what did we do?', because we were absolutely ignorant about our process, and we were so scared that we didn't understand. But they told us, and slowly we learned. What did we learn? The first thing that we learned was that the language that we were using was incorrect. I was an Argentinean, middle-class Jew who spoke an English that was a little bit worse than now, and was talking with families from Harlem who spoke a dialect that did not resemble at all to Spanish. We learned that families are complex social systems and that they contain subsystems which may have different agendas from each other. We learned that people function in different ways in different social contexts. We learned that, because of these realities, each person has diverse selves, that attachment occurs with different people in different contexts, that family members feel a responsibility and a commitment to each other and even in our families, and that a therapist should be mobilizing their capacity to protect and heal each other. In effect, we developed a point of view that was optimistic. We thought that we could help them to become more harmonious. And since we were all leftists, we thought that we had a cure to social issues, that if we were able to organize this family to function with a sense of competence, they would be able, then, to change the welfare system in the United States. We learned also that therapy is always partial and that we were working always with part of the system. We didn't know that we had to learn that. This is the reflection today about what we learned that we discovered later that we learned. These ideas became more evident as time and work went forward. I think that I will need some water. Is there anybody that can -- yeah. What was my style during this period? I felt responsible for helping families. You will see later on that I will describe to you that responsibility was from the beginning in my family. I am the oldest son. In Hebrew, the oldest son is called the "bachor", and "bachor" means responsible. And I was a responsible son. 

00:16:20
UNKNOWN Can you turn the mic more to you, please? 

00:16:25
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN You cannot hear me? 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN Turn the mic, please. 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN I don't know what she's saying. 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN Turn the mic. 

00:16:30
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN  This mic? 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:16:35
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN Oh, can you take the mic? Yes. 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN Lower it down. 

00:16:40
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN Thank you. Is that correct? Okay. I felt responsible for helping families, but I was different than other practitioners because of my challenging style. I was a Quixote of sorts. I was opening up conflicts and I was certain that such explorations would produce experiential change. I didn't doubt that families have available resources, that they would be actualized when needed. I had no knowledge then of the concept of resilience, which was elaborated later by Froma Walsh in relation to families. But to me it was a natural product of life, an idea I had taken from my reading of Borges, the Argentinean poet and writer who had written that when you come to a bifurcation, when you come to a crossroad, you take both roads. It was a paradox. And I understood later that he was saying the road not taken remains available and you need to actualize that road. Now, how did I come to this style? Because one of the things why I was different from other family therapists at this time was very simple. Other family therapists at this time were looking for meaning. They were psychiatrists talking, working with psychotic patients, and they were looking for meaning. I was working with families that were trying to resolve problems of survival in society. That experience of working with a different population created a completely different mindset when I was working. Now, with apologies, I must take a detour again. I need to summarize the early realities that prepared me for becoming the kind of therapist that I was. I was born in Argentina in 1921. My parents were a typical 20th century couple. My father was the executive; he was related to the world. My mother was the affective partner, and he was -- she was in charge of the family. A Talcott Parsons kind of family, but Jewish. 

00:19:30
[sil.] 

00:19:35
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN In a small town in an anti-Semitic background in Argentina, I was the oldest of three siblings. And in the traditional legacy from my parents, I was the responsible one. I became responsible for my siblings, for my parents, for my extended family, and for the Jews of the world. In my childhood, that represented the totality of what was known and familiar. Obligations to and for this group marked my first identity. From there I jump two decades in my story. I was then a medical student, and it was the era when General Peron, a dictator, carried out a military coup and became the Argentinean dictator. I participated in the student uprising against the government, occupation of universities, and was jailed for three months, where -- and then I was jailed three months, where I learned something about -- while I was in isolation, about sleep deprivation. I was expelled from university, continued my studies in Uruguay, and was finally accepted again in Argentina to finish my medical preparation. Through that period, I saw myself as an Argentinean Jew, a leftist and a rebel, and I felt heroic. My identity now was more complex, at some level dormant, but still available. I was still the shy -- the shy child and the adolescent boy, but these aspects now shared space with a more accomplished self. In 1948, as I was preparing to open my pediatric practice in Buenos Aires, the UN recognized Israel as a nation, and the War of Independence broke out in Israel. I felt I needed to go there, and I became a medical officer in the Israeli army. And as a doctor during that war, I learned to do triage under pressure, and I became increasingly comfortable with my competence and my authority, another thickening of my -- of my identity. I hear an echo. Do you hear an echo? 

00:22:25
UNKNOWN No. 

00:22:25
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN No? Okay, very good. The echo is my child. Okay. At the end of -- at the end of the war, I moved to the United States to specialize in child psychiatry. But what I learned first was what it meant to be a foreigner. Knowing nobody and unable to speak the language, I ate my meals in a cafeteria, Horn & Hardart, where you could see the food and take it off the shelves without knowing what was their name. I went to the movies in the morning, when it didn't cost much, and I watched cowboy films to accustom my ear to the sound of English. So my English was quite -- quite idiosyncratic. Being a foreigner is an experiment in problem-solving, I am sure that in this conference there are quite a number of people that will respond to the experience of being a foreigner. It's an experiment in problem-solving. Everything is almost recognizable, but not completely. In my head, everything had more than one name. What was "mesa" in Spanish was a "shulchan" in Hebrew, a "tisch" in Yiddish, a "table" in English, a "tavolo" in Italian. Reality was diversity. But I didn't see it that way. I was uncertain, frightened and dependent on the generosity of strangers. People helped, and I found organizations and institutions where I could learn child psychiatry and the various ways that people in New York were working with children at the Jewish Board of Guardians in New York and with Lauretta Bender at Bellevue hospital, and through living at the residential institution for problematic children. In that first year I met Pat, a red-haired, bright and beautiful psychologist. We married in 1951, and she became part of my dialogues for the next 58 years. When your monologues become dialogues, reality expands, a new perspective opens, and identity shifts. Since being part of a couple is the text of thousands of books, and many practitioners in this conference have been discussing couplehood, I will continue by talking about the journey that we took now together as it continued to shape my thinking, my style as a therapist, and my identity. For us, life together started in Israel when we moved forever. But forever lasted only three years. But it was a rich period. 

00:25:55
[sil.] 

00:25:55
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN  Are we together up to now? 

00:26:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:26:00
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN Okay. It was a rich period in my professional life. I became the psychiatric director of six institutions established by an organization that worked with children who had survived the European Holocaust and who had arrived -- and other children who had arrived from Arab countries with their -- without their families. The children had not adapted to life in the kibbutzim, their original placement, and it required a more therapeutic environment. It was there that I began to understand the profound implications of cultural diversity for the adaptation of human beings, and to think professionally about the family influence in the ways in which children cope with life. It was there also where my ideas about Jews as an ethnic group changed. Yemenites, Moroccans, Bulgarians and Italian Jews all look different from each other. So the idea of a Jewish identity began to be questioned for me in terms of each one of these children. I had -- I took pictures of the children. I had 30 pictures of the children. I could identify the French child from the Moroccan child, form the Bulgarian child. Someplace in history, there was some mix-up. Life in Israel at that time was an adventure, both interesting and difficult. But I had decided to train as an analyst, and we returned to the United States, where I had been accepted as a candidate by the William Alanson White Institute in New York. We had one child by then, Danny, who had been born in Israel. We were very poor, and Pat became our main financial support. My days were a strange mixture of psychoanalytic studies, fee for service at the clinic, the Broiler(ph) Clinic that paid me $4 per session when the families -- when the patients arrived, if they came. And finally, I was also working. I worked with Wiltwyck -- at Wiltwyck, with the welfare population. This mixture between psychoanalysis, individual therapy and working with welfare families was a strange mixture, and was a breeding ground for contradictions. And I found it difficult to create a coherent set of professional ideas I could believe in. I think that what I am trying to convey to you was the fact that, through my career, I had periods in which I believed with certainty about certain things that later in other contexts I questioned and I changed. And I adhered with the same certainty with the other ideas that then I questioned and I changed for other things. And I think that this is very important in this conference, because we are talking in boxes, and the boxes do not change. And I really think that we need to begin to stretch our hands outside of the boxes and touch our colleagues. 

00:30:10
[sil.] 

00:30:10
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN  I want to talk about some of my doubts during this time. I went to my psychoanalytic sessions three times a week. The focus then was on my dependent relationship with my mother and my passive-aggressive relationship with my father. Probably all of you had the same experience. The difficulties of adapting to our new life in New York became a less or more distant event. I learned a lot of things about my early life. But when I described to my psychoanalyst the heroic events that I was proud of, my analyst responded, "Salvador, you are a cork on the crest of a wave. You go where the current takes you." She was wrong. You know, she was saying that the shy dependent child that I was as a child was still there when I was 35 years old, and she was wrong. For my analyst, identity was a single evolving event starting in childhood and understood by reenacting events of my early life. I was like the "Groundhog" movie: I was changing and I was repeating the same day through all my life. At 88 years old, this is a very long day. 

00:32:10
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN  For me, identity formation was episodic and multiple. I was about 35 years old then, and I had lived through many events, struggled with many demons, related to a variety of significant people. And there were psychological resources that surfaced at different periods, in different circumstances, in different contexts. What was collateral for my analyst was central for me and for this small group of people that were my current family. But I need to jump again, this time in the mid-'60s when we moved to Philadelphia and I became professor of child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, and the director of the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic. It was not a small transition. 

00:33:15
[sil.] 

00:33:15
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN  From the beginning, as the director of the clinic, I insisted that all the children accepted for therapy came in with their families. I said 'Child psychiatry is family psychiatry,' and that -- Thank you. I still think like that. That was accepted by our clients. At some point, we had 4,000 children in therapy for a year, with 4,000 families. And there was no question for our clientele that when they have a child with a problem, they would come to the clinic as a family. But the Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists challenged our training of psychiatric fellows, and the AMA sent a group to inspect the clinic and the univers -- Penn University started an investigation about our training. They finished -- the Department of Psychiatry had then finished its investigation, saying that the training of family therapy for psychiatric fellows was dangerous for the Department of Psychiatry and that they should stop sending fellows to the child -- to the clinic for training. So, as you see, it was a difficult period. Strangely enough, I had closed the circle as in my childhood where I was a member of a minority group and was rejected. I was again, in the University of Pennsylvania, the ogre. But the clinic was a different story. We had become a successful institution. We had a very large staff, an outpatient service, an inpatient facility, and two apartments where we hospitalized seriously difficult families in an external training program. In the '60s and '70s, the clinic was one of the main centers of family therapy in the world, with a constant flow of professional visitors from all over who came to learn what we were doing. I had a special concern for foreigners. We had a tremendous number of foreign students that came to study family therapy at this time. Between the '60s and the '80s, family therapy was the main event in therapy, or at least we thought so, and we predicted that in the twenty-first century it would become the most important type of intervention. And of course we were wrong. 

00:36:40
[sil.] 

00:36:40
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN  Nonetheless, interesting things were happening during this period and after. And I want to talk about the different ways in which the field has developed. So I come now to the field of family therapy and the evolving field of family therapy. During the period in which I was in Philadelphia, we were working primarily with poor multi-crisis families whose problems included their experience with established institutions of judicial and welfare. It was evident that the selection of these patients required a practice different from that of most family therapist who were engaged -- I said already that they were engaged in the unraveling of the mysteries of psychosis. Bateson produced, for instance, a paper on the double bind, which postulated that the ramblings of schizophrenics were the result of injunctions by parents who had sent contradictory messages: "I love you. Don't be me near me." And then a third message that the commands must both be obeyed. What is extraordinary is the certainty during this period that that was true, that schizophrenia was the product essentially of the schizophrenogenic mother sending two conflicting messages. While Bateson, Way-Tucker, Bowen and others were concerned with the meaning of psychotic communication, I was focusing on the patterns of relating among family members in a population that was struggling with basic life crises. 

00:38:50
[sil.] 

00:38:50
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN  So I was not concerned with meanings; I was concerned with relationships. My previous experience as an immigrant and my experiences in Israel with a population for diverse -- from diverse cultures had expanded my sensitivity to social encounters. I knew that people must respond to the demands of new and changing social structures by expanding and adapting, and I expected to find that potential in most families. From the beginning, my therapy was optimistic. I was not looking for pathology. I was looking for the possibility of expansion, and I was certain that I had the tools in my contact with families to change them. That optimistic view was challenged again and again, yet it has persisted. I continue being -- I continue adhering to the same point of view. Since the time of our first experiment at Wiltwyck with the three-stage sessions, I have focused on understanding family patterns and exploring possible avenues for novel ways of relating. I have changed my style of therapy, but I remain wedded to these same concepts and goals. As time went by, a variety of approaches came along; each one of them had an impact in the field and on aspects of my own work. I will briefly comment on a few: the Milano group that came from Italy; the women's movement; the postmodernist movement, including the collaborative and the narrative approach; and the evidence-based work. First, the impact of the Milanos group who was led by Mara Selvini Palazzoli. They offered a series of clear techniques that made it very popular in the United States. It was the clarity of their thinking and of their techniques that was attractive. Among them was a technique of splitting the therapeutic team with one therapist in the room and the rest of the team behind the one-way mirror. The family was seen every two weeks. The therapists were neutral and curious; they invited family members to gossip about the troubled members, and gave paradoxical feedbacks and homework at the end of the session. The idea was that the families, after they left the session and before they come to the next session, will resist the therapeutic task and will not do it or will do something different. And to me that was very strange. I could never understand paradoxes, because I was spending all my time trying to join with families and trying to make families join with me so that we could together evolve a collaborative approach for change. So the idea that families should resist me did not enter into my (inaudible ). My response there was critical. Any technique that controlled the therapist's freedom and constrained the responsibility for family change seemed to me to be against the central therapeutic contract. I believed that change occurred in the relationships between the therapist and the family members. That probably comes from my psychoanalytic training and my ideas of transference. But I borrowed from the Milano group this flexibility about time, and later I experimented with marathon sessions that lasted over a weekend. The feminist movement of family therapy evolved in the late '70s when family therapists -- female therapists challenged the chauvinist leadership of the early pioneers, who were almost all white male psychiatrists. They accused systems theory of being blind to the imbalance of power between the sexes. In effect, they said that the systems thinking blamed the -- blamed the victim. My response was critical. You will notice at this point that always my first response to novelty is critical. But later I learned: I pressed the stop-a-moment button and I reflected. While still wedded to systems theory, I realized that my language was not neutral. I described mothers as enmeshed instead of affiliative. And I began to pay attention to these automatic terms. I made sure that the chapters in my subsequent books used alternating genders for the cases. And when Marianne Walters, who worked at the clinic, pointed out that the leadership at the clinic was all male, I first defended myself, and then thought that she was right, and changed the table of organization of the clinic. And the first person that changed position was Marianne Walters. Postmodernist thinking arrived in the '90s, challenging the concept of reality. Reality from this perspective is simple social consensus. And diagnosis in mental health is the imposition of establishment norms on people who have not the power of resistance. This is a very leftist point of view. And actually this leftist -- leftist point of view in Italy produced changes in the sense that new psychiatric hospitals could not be built in -- in Italy after the Basaglia Law was established. The postmodernists wielding an intellectual broom cleaned the field of certainties. Now nothing was certain anymore. For the collaborative thinkers Goolishian and Anderson, this orientation meant that the therapist needs to accept that ignorance. That's not a bad concept. Therapy needs to be seen as a conversation among equals, and the therapist needs to be more into a coach. To my critical eye, proponents of this approach were living in both sides of a paradox. Only an expert can take the position of non-expertise. But I saw in their theory a mandate to look at my assertive style. After this point, I was extremely centered -- very directed and centered, and I incorporated more questions into my therapy, I doubted more frequently, I used more humor, and I became more aware of symmetrical relationships between therapists and patients. As I was criticizing the different points of view, I was borrowing. If they had something that was useful, it was not for them to have; this was for us to take and to use. Every innovation in the field invited me to borrow and to question. My style incorporated new techniques and became more nuanced. Still, my basic concept about the process of therapeutic change and about the therapist's responsibility for shaping that process did not change. Though, actually it did change in the sense that in the beginning I thought that change occurred at the point in which we educate the patient. If we gave the patient information that their point of view did not include systemic ideas, they will say 'A-ha, we see it,' and they will change. And I spent, like, ten years thinking like that, and then I knew that I was wrong. And then I began to say 'Okay, I will offer you the hope of a more harmonious life,' the pleasure principle. And in effect, I changed quite a lot in the sense that my therapy became a more benign therapy. I am 88 years old. In the last decade my energy diminished, but my sense of responsibility increased. And now I think that one of the things that is tremendously significant in the process of change is to potentialize in patients the sense of responsibility for each other. In effect, what I try is to make family members healers of each other. So that was a sequence in which I still continue educating and giving information. I still am giving them hope that with my help they could reach a sense of harmony that now I am including in all my sessions. If you hear -- if you watch one of my tapes, you will see that -- how can you help your spouse, how can you help -- I would say to a 16-year old girl, 'How can you help your father, who is a such a squirrel, to be able to understand the dreams and the needs of a 16-year old seductive beautiful daughter?' So my language is continuously saying to people 'You can help your -- the other members of your family.'Now, the less -- oh, the -- the narrative -- the narrative movement. To me, that is personalized by Michael -- by Michael White. And I think that today he's the most widespread and most influential in the field. By the way, Michael White was my friend -- 

00:51:30
[sil.] 

00:51:30
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN -- and I admired and respected him. And we disagree almost in everything, but it is nice to respect a person, because then the disagreements become dialogues instead of polemics. And we had quite a number of dialogues that were very growth-encouraging. The narrative therapists have taken the ideas of Foucault, the French philosopher, and translated them into an organized set of rules for therapy. But Foucault was a liberation theorist; he said that we were trapped by the power of the establishment stories and that we are unaware of our submission; to be free, we need to resist the dominant narratives. The philosophy -- this philosophy that had its roots in Marxist thinking may have had an appeal in the social sciences. But in the interventive field of family therapy, it had unexpected consequences. The individual is no longer anchored to the family. Rather, he or she is invited to search internally for alternative stories that will facilitate freedom from the labels that had been imposed from outside. Narrative therapy then becomes a way of exploring a roadmap of alternatives using individual cognitive processes. Family members became the audience that facilitate the process, but they are not central, and they are certainly not responsible participants for healing. But I took quite a lot of things from Michael White that I use freely and that I encourage you to use freely as well. I like very much his concept of family members as healers. There is an element of ritual that is very good; uh, and other things that at this moment escape me. During the last decade, a number of manualized approaches -- let me see where I am. I still have 15 minutes. Okay. Are you -- are you with me for the next 15 minutes? Yeah? Okay. During the last decades, a number of manualized approaches to work with juvenile delinquents and drug addicts have been accepted as evidence-based; this is the work of Little, Henggeler, Sapochnik and others. Maybe in a modified way, and I will talk later with the Gottmans -- their approach can be considered manualized, though it's a much more complex approach. And these approaches have shown some success with large populations. Specifically, essentially behavioral techniques may be the most economical approach to certain problems, especially with limited populations that respond to the structure of the intervention. However, it leaves out a large universe of people who for a variety of reasons cannot respond to the required steps of the program approach. In the last decade, I have developed a new procedure, a four-stage method for assessing families, and I think I will talk about that tomorrow. In the end I want to return very briefly to the reality of children and to the fact that they had disappeared from family therapy in the United States. In early November, a documentary program on PBS titled "Medicated Child", that I would recommend if you can see it -- because it is a horror film. To everybody that is interested in horror films, they should watch that. It's called "Medicated -- Medicated Children". And there it shows the children as young as four years old are diagnosed as bipolar and treated by a cocktail of medications. Twelve years -- eight years later, the four-year old child that were diagnosed as bipolar are still diagnosed as bipolar, but now have a movement that is the product of the cocktails of medications that are taken. The child molesters are psychiatrists and were shown -- and were shown in this program as engaging in the exploration of new drugs, or better drugs. There was no indication in this presentation, and it lasted one hour, that there were other forms of therapy for children, that maybe children can talk. And I felt guilty and I felt ashamed that I, and we, have abandoned children to a psychiatric god of destruction and -- the psychiatric --

DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN  Now, there are better ways of working. And now I want to do something that is the first time I do. I want to show you the work of a friend and colleague of mine, Wai-Yung Lee, who works in Hong Kong and has developed some kind of fascinating work, ways of starting sessions. She starts these sessions saying to the parents 'You talk about the conflict that you have.' And the children are observing the parents talking about the conflict, and the children, like in the work of the Gottmans, are hooked to a computer that measures, uh, heart -- heart, galvanic responses and things like that. And I want to show you three families in probably no more than eight minutes. Can you show that? Where -- you people that are -- can you show the --

DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN Now, I will tell you a secret: This child was trained by Susan Johnson. Can we -- I want to show you three of these cases. This is the extent -- and it is extraordinary what happens when you give to children the power of telling their stories. The child is -- uh, the therapist is present, the child is present. And it is part of a study that she's doing of the effect of conflict of parents on children's ideation and ways of organizing life. Can you show the next one? 

01:04:15
[non-English narration] 

01:04:15
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN  The next one? 

01:05:20
[non-English narration] 

01:05:20
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN  The next one? 

01:06:15
[non-English narration] 

01:06:15
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN  Okay, the therapist is present, and the therapist does -- there is another segment that is three minutes. Can you -- 

01:07:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:07:35
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN Can you watch? So can you have the next one? 

01:07:45
[sil.] 

01:07:45
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN No. The next one. 

01:07:55
[non-English narration] 

01:07:55
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN  Okay, apparently we had some -- can you show the next -- the next one? 

01:08:30
UNKNOWN Is it the -- the very next one? I'm not sure. 

01:08:35
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN Okay. I -- I have -- 

01:08:45
[non-English narration] 

01:08:45
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN  Okay. You see, I would never have done that, because in the way which I was thinking, because I work with families in which there was no sense of hierarchy, I had put always the parents hierarchically supporting and controlling the children. Wai-Yung Lee, who had written two books with me, is a very, very dear friend, decided that I was wrong, and she decided that the children could start telling what they think about the parents. And that's the result, and she's developing research on that. And I want you to help me to send her an applause, because I --

[sil.] 

01:11:45
DR. SALVADOR MINUCHIN  Okay, people, that -- that is probably, uh, the last time that I will be at the Erickson Foundation, because five years from now, I don't know that I could do any more heavy lifting. So I will say goodbye to you.
