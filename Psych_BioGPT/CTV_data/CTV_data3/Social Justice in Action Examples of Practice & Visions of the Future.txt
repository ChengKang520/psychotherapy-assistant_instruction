REBECCA L. TOPOREK  Uhm, okay, welcome. We're really glad to have you. We know this is a short time and all of the workshops are kind of backed up this morning so, uhm, welcome and we'll sort of try to keep on time. We have uhm, four of us who are gonna be presenting and we're very, very enthusiastic about what we're presenting, so we have so much that we wanna talk about. And we're gonna try to get it into ah, 50 minutes, but to let you know if, if this just peaks your interest, uhm, we are doing ah, workshop more in depth later on today at three o'clock, where we're actually gonna be getting in to doing uhm, work groups, and resolving barriers, addressing barriers, coming up with solutions, that kind of thing, later on. So right now, what we'd really like to do is provide you with some examples to talk about, uhm, social justice and action, uhm, examples of practice, and then also some ideas of where we think, given what we've seen so far, uhm, where we think may be the field might be going or some of the things that we need to address. Uhm. 

00:01:40
 I think Mary could help you to do (inaudible ). 

00:01:44
REBECCA L. TOPOREK  That would be great, if you could just, ah, yeah, do the next slide. Okay so, uhm, this is who we are and I think it's probably easier just to have us each introduce ourself. Uhm, I'm gonna go ahead and go first. Uhm, I'm Rebecca Toporek. I'm from San Francisco State University. I'm an assistant professor there in the Counseling Department. Uhm, it's a Master's level counseling program, ah, with six specializations so I teach in the college and career, uhm, specializations, as well as core classes for all of our other students: Rehab school, uhm, marriage and family therapy, gerontology. Uhm, and ah, my interest in social justice has come from, it, it started actually in working and finding that what I was doing in counseling really wasn't sufficient for the people that I was working with. Uhm, I started off out of my master's program long time ago working in wel, welfare to work program where I was the liaison between Department of Social Services and uhm, the community college and, and the thing that I found was that uh, uh no matter how good my counseling skills were, if we didn't address the system and the systemic barriers that the students were facing, then it really didn't matter how good my counseling skills were. There were things going on outside of our counseling that needed to be addressed. And after about six years of working in community colleges, I ended up going back from my doctoral program, and one of the most frustrating things that I found was that my view of what a counselor and counseling psychologist ought to be wasn't necessarily shared by the faculty in my program. And so, uhm, one of my big, ah, emphasis has really been on looking at training and how do we train counselors and counseling psychologists to do this other part of the work because there's a legacy in counseling psychology for that but it doesn't seemed to be integrated into our ethic's training, into practicum, into what we do and how we view our profession, even into our theoretical orientations and what we look at. So, I'd like to talk uhm, briefly just kind of get a common uhm, definition or let you know sort of what, what my definition is and also some common themes that we found in, uhm, I'll just have to say it right now ah, the, a big project that the four of us have worked on over the last, like two years uhm, is to gather stories of, from people who were doing social justice work in various arenas within counseling psychology and to ask them to write about what are you doing, how are you doing it, and what's the theoretical basis, what are the ethical issues, what are the multicultural issues, uhm, and where do you think this needs to go. And so, out of all of the stories that we gather there about 35 chapters in there, there are some themes, and so I wanna talk about what some of the themes are and that kind of helps define, I think, wha, what social justice means, uhm, for me, and I think that's an important piece because social justice is a word that's being used in a lot of places now and I, and I, I think it's important for us to look (inaudible ) what does that really mean. Uhm, the other things I'm gonna talk about are some examples, some issues around training issues in social justice, uhm, also issues and programs in vocational psychology, career counseling, and then also policy and legislation. Uhm, (inaudible ). The five themes uhm, that ah, I think we really saw in terms of the different contributions people made in terms of their experiences in the work that they're doing uhm, and again this (inaudible ) there are lots and lots of other good work. These are just some examples. But I think if we were to look at a lot of examples of work that people are doing, we might find some similar themes. So one of them is community involvement, and I think that's really important especially in terms of things that I've heard people say over (inaudible ) and social justice can't be an academic exercise. It can't stay within the theory realm. It can't just stay within us all talking about (inaudible ) for us to take at home and actually implement or be involved (inaudible ) that is that it also is antithetical to this practice for us to take what we conceive as the community's notions, and go out and do that without actually having the community drive of what we're doing (inaudible ) community then for us to go out and do that would really be, maybe it's little quite they are. We're about ah, (inaudible ) kinda colonial as a mental way. We're really imposing our view of what (inaudible ) community from an outside perspective. And so, one of the themes in terms of a lot of examples of social justice work is being (inaudible ) really working in, in collaboration and partnership with the community (inaudible ) in terms of us having to understand the biases and values (inaudible ) and how to deal with that when it may not necessarily drive completely with the community and so, uhm, that (inaudible ). The other one is interdisciplinary collaboration (inaudible ) the problems and issues that are out there really require a whole lot of different perspectives. And so, one of the things that seems to happen even in the presentation that I was in right before there's one of, ah, there was a social worker (inaudible ), person there saying, "You know, we just don't really talk (inaudible ) and there's so much who would really working toward the same goals but we seemed to have this division between different disciplines." And so, in order to become (inaudible ) these are huge problems we're trying to deal with, you know, poverty, that's a big one, you know. So, we need to have a lot of different people working toward, uhm, some change. And ah, there's a really great example. Tania's was, I think, really forefront in this within, and Gargi, too, actually within, uhm, (inaudible ) Association Division 17 Counseling Psychology was looking at the different people, the different groups within that organization who were (inaudible ) particular issues so the section on ethnic and racial diversity (inaudible ) the different sections focusing on, uhm, the section on (inaudible ) and then I keep thinking of the a, the ago(ph), (inaudible ) by APAs, is this? (crosstalk) 

00:08:07
 (inaudible ). 

00:08:10
REBECCA L. TOPOREK Yes, thank you. Uhm, and so (inaudible ) that there are these three different sections and we're all working against (inaudible ) but we don't necessarily serve as allies (inaudible ). So more up high is the sort of group that can (inaudible ). Okay, let's see how we can be ah, allies for each other. Let's learn about each other (inaudible ). Let's learn about when we're in different forms, how can we support you, uhm, and so I think that's one really great example. The other thing in (inaudible ) is looking at multi-level and systemic approaches. (inaudible ) social justice on an individual level, uhm, empowerment may be important uhm, but also really needs to be dealt within a systemic level and so, uhm, Dr. Prillenltensky yesterday and, in (inaudible ) his presentation I think made some really excellent points about, uhm, a lot of our organizations are really working to make changes (inaudible ) at an individual level and when it continues to be at an individual level (inaudible ) it's really not going to be enough. Another thing (inaudible ) ah, with a lot of the examples that we covered were the (inaudible ) and looking at, uhm, the difficulty in terms of (inaudible ) being patient and especially when you're working with the community (inaudible ) that's been longstanding is that it, it's probably going to be (inaudible ) slow and you may not even see the change in your life (inaudible ) the work that comes after you and that it's really important to (inaudible ) sort of sustaining yourself and sustaining the effort, and also finding ways for (inaudible ) sustain itself so that, uhm, you (inaudible ) especially if you get involved in politics and how that changes. (inaudible ) the last thing is commitment to service and I think this goes in a little (inaudible ) one of the things that came out especially when talking about ethics. The history of research in (inaudible ) communities has not always been that positive. There's been a history sometimes of researchers going into a community doing the research and living in the community kinda saying, "So what?" You know, "What does that leave for us?" And so, the other thing that really comes through is uhm, being committed to the community in a way that allows the community to develop trust and also allows the work to continue even after the researcher leaves. So, so, that it's a community collaboration and that the community sort of defines what they can do and even if grant money dries up, no matter what that there's sort of a plan in place so it the, it's not abandonment. Okay? All right. (clears throat) So, the first aspect, I'm in try, trying to talk really fast 'coz I know we have limited time so I just wanna mention ah, rather than going into talking about the different uhm, examples of training, I'm just gonna highlight a couple of different things that uhm, within looking at social justice and training, there are few things that, I think, in terms of our field, uhm, our fields, we probably need to do a little bit better job of looking at getting training that is multi-systemic. So, as opposed to having entirely counseling training being individually focused to integrate more, uhm, systemic levels of interventions in training and practicum and internship as well, uhm, so that ah, when you're out there in the field and you see that advocacy needs to happen, you have a sense of how to do that ethically. You know how, a sense of how to do that appropriately in a way that empowers the community and, and client as opposed to disempowering them. Uhm, in addition, community involvement. Now, I'm fortunate in that, the program that I'm in all of the practicum is in the community and it's all in very high-need communities. But in many programs, my doctoral program, all of my practicum was in the university counseling center. And that didn't really, I think, reach out to the community in the way that it could have. And so, I think, one of the other things in terms of looking at our training programs is really where, where is the training happening and is it happening in a way that is helpful to the community. Ethical issues around social justice are really impo, important again. There's been a lot of controversy historically about whether counseling, counseling psychologist, psychology should be involved in, uhm, social justice for political reasons, et cetera, and I think one of the real issues is there are a lot of ethical issues that we need to address. We need to get it out on the table and talk about it, and as students, we need to look at that and understand where, how do you deal with dual boundaries when you're working as partners, you know, different things like that. Uhm, and then finally, service learning which kind of goes into some of the other things I talked about already. Uhm, in terms of vocational psychology, there are a number of different levels that as a counselor, vocational psychologist, uhm, social justice comes in. There are some really excellent examples of counseling psychologist, psychologist working on uhm, employment law, trying to change policies within organizations as well as testifying bringing research to, uhm, decision-making bodies both at a state and national level, and that that's an arena where we have a lot of uhm, information that we can give and I think even for people who work individually that you're testimony can be really important. I had an experience, over the last two years I had a couple of experiences going and talking with senator's staff and we had our program really well laid out. We'd bring in statistics, et cetera and then we had students bringing client's stories, and I'll tell you that ah, we could have just done the client's stories. They had statistics in their stack, but what really made a big difference were the, the stories. I mean, seriously making that their staff people cry was a really good thing. They're, they're like, "Oh, we've gotta get this on her agenda," uhm, so you know, make them cry that really helps. Uhm, also the voice of the community. So, for example, there's uhm, (inaudible ) and colleagues did a chapter on welfare reform and the importance of really having welfare recipients be a part of the process of welfare reform, really having their voices come out and through qualitative research and other methods really being able to raise and help the voices come to the surface when legislative changes are being discussed. And then also partnerships, this goes back to the interdisciplinary thing, but one of the other examples, uhm, just very briefly in terms of partnerships is social entrepreneurship within uhm, vocational psychology, vocational training, and that's a partnering between, uhm, businesses, nonprofits, education, and training where, uhm, it's a model whereby the people who are in the program are actually running the program. And so, it's a process of, uhm, housing, substance abuse counseling, counseling job training where it's actually run by the people who are doing it. It involves professionals. We serve as consultants. We serve in terms of helping deal with the system, but that it's not something that's completely funded on, on a non-profit basis so the products that the, uhm, organization is providing in, in San Francisco, there are a number of them, one, ah, Rubicon Industries has a bakery, they have landscaping, they have a number of things, and so the profits from that go to help fund the organization. So, it's not something that's completely dependent on public funds. And then actually given time, I'm just gonna ah, very briefly say I've talked a lot about policy and legislation, just some different examples are ah, a counseling psychologist who, after therapy level, realized what really needed to happen is big change so he became a congressman. (laughs) It's a good example. Also, working as a lobbyist within state organizations, within psychological organizations, uhm, serving as an expert witness. I already mentioned in terms of bringing the research to uhm, the politicians and really explaining it in ways that they understand. Uhm, and then also social activists which I know that a number of you are or are in becoming, uhm, and these guys are gonna talk about more of that, so can I turn that over? You're the next one. Larry? Oh, thank you.

00:16:45
LAWRENCE GERSTEIN  Thank you. I appreciate you all being here and ah, thanks Reb, Rebecca for giving a good overview. I don't usually do this but uhm, I, I will give us a plug for the book. The, the reason I'll plug it is that, uhm, I think Rebecca, Rebecca kind of, was very humble in, uhm, how she gave a presentation on the overview of the book. Uhm, the thing that's unique about this book is that we really encouraged the authors to present a systemic perspective in a structural model for how they went about doing their work and to try the best they could to, uhm, integrate ah, different disciplines in their discussion, and I think at this point in time there, there isn't really a book that I know of that has that kind of framework. The other piece of it is that the authors in the book are actually out in the field doing things and what they're doing is very (inaudible ). The last thing I'll say about the book is that, yeah, I'm plugging it but I'm not, I'm not really plugging it for me really uhm, and I'll tell you why. One reason is that ah, the five of us who are editors of this book decided to take our royalties which I don't know how much that'll be. Uhm, it, the book is expensive. All books, all textbooks are expensive now (inaudible ) to uhm, do something uhm, in an activist way with our money that potentially will make from the book and what it is is that we engaged in a process with Division 17, uhm, the Society of Counseling Psychology to create a new award. The new award is the social justice award and it comes with a monetary, uhm, value of a thousand dollars a year. So, uhm, what we've guaranteed uhm, if Nadia's(ph) not here, the five of us have guaranteed is, if the book doesn't sell such, such that we generate a thousand dollars a year in royalty, we'll each put up the money that's necessary to support the award so, uhm, it's, it's an award that will go to someone who's been involved in the social justice for a while, uhm, so hopefully at some point in time had a future APA, one of you here in the room will get this award, yeah? Yeah. So, let me give you a very brief background about myself and then I'm gonna turn to my section of the book which was on international social justice. The short story for me is that I'm a product of the 60's. Uhm, I grew up in a family of union organizers. I grew up in a family with uhm, a woman who was uhm, in the core group of the women's movement in the United States. And so, around the family table, you know, there was always discussion about inequality, oppression, civil rights, and so I don't know if it's genetic or whatever but I couldn't, I couldn't escape that, uhm, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
 Systemic. 

00:20:05
LAWRENCE GERSTEIN  systemic, yeah, thank you, uhm, that effect on my life. And I'm very grateful for that but at the same time it's a burden, uhm, because as an activist and a social justice agent, I can't walk away from the knowledge of what's happening around the world and the, the mentoring that I receive from my family members, some of whom are no longer here so uhm, it, it carries some challenges with it. The, in terms of uhm, how I've uhm, integrated this, it's taken quite a while uhm, and I look a little bit more mainstream now than I used to look. I had very long hair and a beard, and I was always sort of on the edge of counseling psychology even though I published a lot uhm, and was able to do many things as a professional, my ideology was not quite accepted, and it's taken a long time for me to feel like I'm a part of the community and it's interesting that uhm, since around 2000, the profession itself has embraced the social justice uhm, perspective. And now, I'm a little bit scared, uhm, because it's like all of a sudden I'm in the mainstream. Uhm, I'm in a box, you know, and I feel like I need to get out of the box and I'm, and I'm losing, actually losing my vision, you know, and ah, even consciously I'm losing my vision so it's exciting that this conference is about social justice and that people are moving this agenda. And one way that I think about this is that it's ah, it's ah outgrowth of the multicultural movement that has done phenomenal things, uhm, thinking about the external factors that affect individuals but they've done very little to deal with those external factors. And I think now that the multicultural movement is much more comfortable in its skin, okay, in, in conceptualizing individual issues, I think it has more room to breathe to look systematically and to really address what's happening in our societies around the world which is ah, there's a lot of oppression, a lot of destruction, a lot of victimization, human rights abuses. And for me, just like some other people have said, it's irresponsible of people in the helping professions and educators to sit back and think that one by one we're gonna change the system. We've got to become social architects and really address the systemic forces that are shaping our communities because our communities are falling apart, and if we don't do it, we'll see even more destruction and more interpersonal violence. Uhm, there are lots of roles uhm, that you can engage in, in the international arena. You can be in a consultant, an evaluator, or researcher, educator, trainer, supervisor, lobbyist, uhm, group leader, program developer and, uhm, unfortunately though, there aren't many theories that you can rely on when you look to do international work and social justice. So you have to think broadly, you have to pull from Anthropology and Sociology and Political Science and Economics. And it requires a lot of us to look, look beyond the kind of paradigms that we were introduced to in psychology and education, and think more broadly uhm, and let go of that desire that we have to control things, and really let develop an understanding that emerges from situations that we observe. So, in my section of the book, uhm, which is the international section, there were some (inaudible ) examples of people that uhm, are working all around the world uhm, relying on models like liberation psychology uhm, ah, ah, emancipatory communitative, communitor, emancipatory... (crosstalk) 

00:24:25
 Communitarian? 

00:24:25
LAWRENCE GERSTEIN  communitarian models, uhm, and feminist models and multicultural models drawing from all of these (clears throat) in an effort to uhm, think about the problems that, uhm, ah, they were trying to deal with. We can move on, thank you. So, (clears throat) uhm, in one chapter, Sharon Horne and Susan Matthews talked about their work in uhm, Hungary and Romania. And basically what they're doing there is working with, uhm, women's shelters and, ah, women's centers uhm, to not only develop interventions to, to work with folks that have been victimized and oppressed but more importantly they've developed consult, consultation relationships with the leaders of this organizations to train them how to implement programs that fit with the indigenous cultures in, uhm, in Hungary and Romania. Uhm, the second example I'll point out is uhm, Ben McQuirter(ph) and Ellen McQuirter(ph) uhm, have been doing work in Chile for many, many years. Uhm, their interest in Chile stems from, uhm, their religious orientation with, which is Catholicism. Ben has an uncle that's a priest in Chile, and they started out going down there and just visiting with him and that emerged into what's called a mentoring couples program and so, so through the, through the diocese in this particular area in Chile, they worked with uhm, parents. They mentor parents to mentor other parents, to teach parenting skills, life, life skills, uhm, problem solving skills, conflict management skills. Uhm, another example is uhm, Catherine Norsworthy and her colleagues. Catherine has been doing work all over Asia uhm, Thailand, Burma, uhm, Cambodia, India, uhm, working with uhm, different communities. And her interest has been displaced refugees, uhm, and internally displaced communities, and she (inaudible ) uhm, and worked on reducing violence, uhm, in these groups. Again, working with the leadership structure not as a direct service provider, helping (inaudible ) interventions that fit with the culture that they are, they are in. Uhm, and so for instance ah, one targeted group was ah, folks who uhm, ah, susceptible to HIV/AIDS. Uhm, they've also done peace building, uhm, with groups that are in conflict in those areas. Another chapter in my section was written by uhm, Scott Meshberger(ph) and his ah, actually his classmates. Uhm, and they presented uhm, three different examples. One was ah, working with gangs in El Salvador. Uhm, a second example was, uhm, dealing with the implications of damming in India, uhm, not only the environmental implications but the societal implications of, of these dams that have been built. And the third example that they discussed was the, the tension, uhm, in Kashmir between India and Pakistan. Then the last chapter I mentioned uhm, is my own chapter uhm, and it talks about my work uhm, since the late 1980's trying to solve the Tibet, China problem. And my efforts as an activist and a social justice ah, worker to try to educate people about Tibet, about China and try to find a peaceful solution to, to that particular part of the world. Okay, very quickly uhm, I'm gonna just gonna mention a few things. Uhm, there's a, a number of factors that you need to consider when you're working in international context. Probably the most important thing is that you've gotta come to understand the particular culture that you're working in and respect it. Uhm, the norms and the behaviors. You've gotta use culturally appropriate and affective models uhm, for that culture. A very important piece is that we don't uhm, impose our Western models on other countries. And in fact, there's some very good writing about psychological colonialization and imperialism uhm, overseas and it's a, it's a very difficult problem to deal with but we've got to kind of, we've got to get a handle on this because what we're doing, went, with good intensions overseas is we're destroying indigenous cultures and indigenous ways of healing by exporting our Western models. Uhm, There are many benefits from uhm, doing work overseas. Of course, you get to travel, you get to learn different culture, about different cultures, you develop new relationships, potentially you learn new languages. Uhm, you learn about other ways, uhm, of knowing uhm, from psychologists, other social scientists, educators. There're also challenges that, uhm, you need to deal with. You've gotta cope with the diversity of the cultures that you're, that you're, uhm, that you're experiencing. Uhm, you've gotta kind of understand the cross cultural validity, how that operates? Uhm, and it's, that's a very challenging exercise. This kinda work overseas could be extremely frustrating. Uhm, it takes a great deal of patience, uhm, to develop these relationships. And on my particular case and I think it's true for some other people, it's a challenge to balance the immedias, the immediate needs of being an activist with the academic, uhm, expectations of having a job. So sometimes, for instance uhm, some, some Tibetans, ah, maybe are arrested in Tibet and all of a sudden I have to be involved in a campaign to try to release these people and at the same time I'm thinking about what are my job responsibilities, how am I gonna fulfill that? So balancing if, if the social justice activism work is not the main part of your job it's a, it's a difficult thing to do. In conclusion, uhm there are many potential ah, collaborative projects around the world that you can become involved in. As you know, there are lots of examples around the world of oppression, human rights abuse, inequality, uhm, border disputes. Uhm, to be effective, you gotta have a broad perspective, a systemic perspective. You have to have skills that are grounded in a deep understanding and appreciation for culture. Uhm, and I highly encourage you all to seek out opportunities where you can uhm, uhm, learn about cultures, international cultures here in the United States, and potentially through those relationships go overseas and be of assistance to people. Thank you. 

00:31:55
[sil.] 

00:31:55
  I (inaudible ). 

00:32:03
 I know. 

00:32:03
 Okay. 

00:32:03
  Well. 

00:32:05
TANIA ISRAEL You're gonna need a microphone. 

00:32:05
  Gargi(ph). 

00:32:10
GARGI ROYSIRCAR I sent a job before (inaudible ) children. Oh, all right. Well(ph), I've always been outside the box. 

00:32:20
 Can you put this in your pocket? Give me one second. 

00:32:20
GARGI ROYSIRCAR  Pocket? 

00:32:25
 (inaudible ). 

00:32:26
GARGI ROYSIRCAR Yeah. 

00:32:26
GARGI ROYSIRCAR Uhm. So uhm, I was, uhm, taking care of two sections of the book. Uhm, both areas are for a great interest to me. One is because I was, I'm a former, a school teacher, high school teacher, and I take outreach services to uhm, ah, ah, speakers of English as a second language, kids. So we, I do some mentoring work so ah, this just fell into ah, my interest, and I've taught in three different, ah, countries so, uhm, so I have ah, some idea, ah, about school children in a kind of a very broad perspective. And I'm also interested in health psychology and, and, and uhm, having conducted, uhm, a program for Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees at Cambridge Hospital ah, associated with Harvard ah, Medical School. Uhm, so, so ah, I think I am attracted to both schools as well as, uhm, ah, to uhm, health psychology because they provide this opening for interdisciplinary work. These are organizations that can benefit from our participation so, uhm I, I, I would like to ah, refer to a theoretical model already in psychology that we can implement, ah, when we do collaborative work. Ah, I refer to this ecological model ah, where an individual lives within a set of nested environmental systems and, and you, we talked about ah, systemic, so I'm just throwing you, ah, throwing some theoretical concepts like the microsystem, the kids in the schools, their family, ah, their neighborhood, their churches is very important, the racial ethnic association, so I'm taking traditional psychological theory and putting it with marginalized communities. The relationships among these units (inaudible ) the mesosystem(ph), the exosystem is the biggest systems around us where we do not have an active role, ah, but definitely affects us and the macrosystem, the larger culture, so there is this drawing of, of Brons & Brenna(ph) and ah, I'm kind of adapting and since, interesting that he did it for community of psychology but he didn't have a social justice orientation. So community of psychology is really different from us, ah, ah that you're going in to provide access. So you have the family, the religious system, the school room, the peers, and then you have the community, mass media, health agency, and the school over there should be actually the school system. And then the mi, macrosystem ah, that we have to also work with ah, but we have really little power, ah, but we can do to, by working with legislators and so you have the political system there. Uhm, across all the chapters in the school of section, I really found something really interesting again putting it into psychological theory, I found some risk factors for children. What are these risk factors? Low socioeconomic status, no access to primary care, exposure to lead paint, inadequate parental availability and supervision, cultural acceptance of corporal punishment, you know that's a macrosystem that happens sometimes with some of the immigrant families, uhm, no connection between teachers and parents, underemployment, and low salary of parent. So parents are not available to, to give supervision to these children, but there are also protective factors, so how can we utilize the protective factors to strengthen and empower our children. So the community and neighborhood programs in immigrant communities, the exosystem protect the fact that educational reform that we're all trying to do ah, kinda get rid of all the standardized tests in Massachusetts. I, I, I will, I really, there are two people that I want to re, recognize over here who are doing great social justice work, Elizabeth Sparks(ph) and Michael Go(ph). So I don't want to talk down to you guys, you know, you've been working so much in the community and internationally. I think they just kinda refer to people to gather exchanging ideas so do take it that way. We don't wanna talk down to the choir. Uhm, and so extended family system, you know, I come from a cultural per, perspective, some always looking at the family system but the family system can also be abusive. Again, traditional psychological theory, there's primary prevention ah, that is incidence-reducing, you know, having wellness programs in the schools after school programming; great, reaching all the children. Uhm, but there's also, I, I'm not against at all to secondary prevention because I'm a psychologist so how can we reduce uhm, the prevalence rates of dieting among our elementary kids or hanging out with gangs, not yet participating, you know, they're not identified but, but they have with the group that is at high risk. So I'm really interested in, in, I think I really do secondary prevention along with wellness programs and I'm not ag, against to individual therapy at all and, because we have to refer our kids who have alcohol dependence and violence of behaviors for counseling. Uhm, I, I want to move on because of time so do read these. We have some wonderful interventions and most of them seem to be like wellness programs. Ah, er, erasing the consciousness, racial consciousness of African-American kids. There're some, actually, a secondary prevention ah, in a chapter where ah, they're working with the Latino kids in high risk populations. So ah, and all training teacher trainees do work with children. Uhm, so if I were to look at types of intervention, ah, we primarily refer to universal int, ah, attention, interventions and I'll take you to wellness programs, and I think it's a very important for us so do in social justice work, attend to risks that are considered to be evenly distributed, evenly distributed ac, across the school population: low activity level, nutrition, low academic performance, racial, cultural, and ethnic divide and then target them, ah, the, the protective mechanisms. So, what are the protective mechanisms? Let's develop the competence of these kids. Let's develop the resilience of these kids, let's empower them, let's get them good health. Now, I can go on talking so I'm going to move on to, ah, to health psychology and a counseling health psychology's collaborative role in the community, uhm, and I want to say that, ah, like Rebecca said, "Let's go into the community." Well, hospitals, healthcare providers and university psychology departments are located in the community, but do not have a focus on the community. So, it's so ironical that we are located in the community, we do not focus on the community. Uhm, by reaching out to low income individuals, groups, at risk for HIV, AIDS, or racial and ethnic minorities. I, for a minute, I just want to point to my research assistant. Uhm, she is hanging out with kids in an ESL Program in a pretty White-dominated community. So let's go out and, and share our skills with them. A social and economic determinants of health such as conditions of poverty, pollution, employment, housing, education are ignored by insurance providers and health professionals. So, the next question is, how should health organizations allocate its resources? We have three really solid chapters on this or getting into different true case studies. How can we do that? Should the focus remain on prevention or treatment? I mean, I can stride the fence. I believe in both prevention and treatment. And there will never be enough trained clinicians to provide treatment for all diagnosable cases of mental disorder. Therefore, a strong emphasis on prevention is necessary. Uhm, a social justice orientation to health practice includes political responses, to barriers and healthcare, ah, to racial ethnic minorities. I'm just quickening(ph), and these are the uhm, political mandates that we refer to in our chapters. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, A Healthy People 2000 initiative, that was brought about by President Clinton, and unfortunately, he's had all this around 1994 but Monica Lewinsky came in the way. So, you know, he could not fulfill some brilliant ideas he had. So ah, he started the Healthy People's initiative, the common law fund study also initiated by the Senate and the Congress, really interesting stuff. If you read the common law study, it breaks down data by racial and ethnic groups and I found some, because we did a project, a project for the Vietnamese and Cambodians. We got terrific information about their needs. And the Surgeon General's report, of course, 1999, 2000, and 2000, it's ah, going downhill since then because we've heard that they are tampering with the report now. They're cleaning it up. They're cleaning it up. And, of course, we need to incorporate the APA multicultural guidelines. I just want to give you an example of, as psychologist ah, how do we assess, how do we address the health status of unresolved individuals, take for instance, the example of obesity? So weight reduction is a multimillion dollar business now versus promoting a healthy lifestyle in free or reduced, ah, fee community of gyms. How about doing that? I'll stop here because I would like to, uhm, ask Tania to come in. 

00:41:55
  Oh, yes. 

00:42:00
[sil.] 

00:42:00
TANIA ISRAEL  Great. They're not (inaudible ) to this pockets. All right, yeah, I got it. Thanks. 

00:42:15
TANIA ISRAEL  I don't, yeah, I don't have my PowerPoint. 

00:42:20
 You have a. (crosstalk) 

00:42:20
TANIA ISRAEL No, I don't, I don't, I don't have PowerPoint. You just look at me. Ah, my name is Tania Israel. I'm an associate professor in the Counseling Clinical School Psychology Program at the University of California in Santa Barbara where it doesn't snow, so I'm actually, it's just quite magical outside right now, uhm, that it's, it's snowing if you haven't noticed. Uhm, so, the section of the book that I particularly edited was on marginalized communities in the United States and as a biracial-bisexual feminist woman of color who grew up in the South, I'm not sure how I ended up doing that section but, (laughs) perhaps I had some ah, credibility, uhm, in, in those terms but uhm, also as an able-bodied U.S. born, uhm, light-skinned, conventionally gendered person who grew up with uhm, economic at the educational advantages. I also came out from the perspective of really thinking about the importance of examining privilege and being an ally to those groups that, ah, that you don't belong to that are oppressed. So, I think it's important to think about it both from an ingroup and an outgroup perspective, uhm, in all of the those ways and, and for all of us to think about the ways in which we may be marginalized in some ways and other ways in which we may be part of the dominant group or gain some privilege based on our group status. Uhm, I'm just going to ah, marginalized groups. You're probably all aware of many of those and ah, have some commitment to working with them, otherwise, you wouldn't be here. So I just wanna get to, uhm, one, one piece of what I wanna say because people talk about, you know, "I'm not really sure I have the skills to be able to do social justice work," and one of the things that became very apparent in, uhm, the chapters in the section on working with marginalized individuals in the United States is that there are skills and resources that we have already developed as psychologists and educators that we can apply to this work, and there are also ways in which we're gonna need to stretched ourselves, uhm, in all of those areas. So I just kind of wanna talk through some of those, give you some examples from the work that, uhm, that, that's reflected in the book so that you can have some sense of what you already bring to this. If you're feeling like, "I don't think I know how to do this," there are some things that you do know how to do, and I think it's important that we all remember that so we know we're building on an existing foundation. One thing that we know how to do is to listen and communicate ah, with clients and colleagues in our own field. And so those are wonderful skills to have. It's why there's so much conversation going on in the hallways and everything 'coz we all like to talk to each other. Uhm, the thing that, that we may need to do to stretch ourselves is learn how to communicate ah, with people in other disciplines. And one of the ways that this became apparent, uhm, Belle(ph) and Goodman talk about their involvement with an innovative program, ah, to assist victims of intimate partner violence, and they work with the team of prosecutors, civil attorneys, and, ah, people from a, a local domestic violence shelter. And they really wanted to work together to identify options, uhm, for each victim that would ensure both offender accountability as well as victim safety. Uhm, prior to that, there had really been sort of a cookie-cutter approach treating every, uhm, situation in the same way and so they, I think we're very effective in bringing out some, bring about some change in the system but in their chapter, they talk about the challenge of trying to work together with, uhm, with people from a legal background, uhm, and having very different agendas perhaps in terms of what should happen, what kinds of outcomes are desirable, having different language, having different assumptions, and so really, uhm, we're used to talking to each other. We need to learn how to talk to people who come at things from a very different perspective in different training. We know how to conduct research, which is great. Research is very important as we're doing social justice work being able to evaluate programs, being able to do research on what we're doing, and share that. So we're not all just trying to do it individually and we have some body of knowledge that we're uhm, building on it and able to contribute to. Uhm, what we, the way that we may need to stretch ourselves is thinking about how to do research outside of a laboratory setting or outside of a, of a survey setting. Uhm, and really think about how to conceptualize and implement research collaboratively in community settings. And this will likely involve some adjustments to what we think of as an ideal research design or at least what we traditionally have. Uhm, we're probably not gonna be able to do things like randomized clinical trials in community settings exactly. Uhm, but that there are of other models that we can draw from. And Lisa Cosgrove talks about uhm, ah, conducting participatory action research where she engaged homeless women, uhm, and shelter staff in a process of identifying, uhm, policy and service recommendations, uhm, to better address the needs of the homeless women, and so she really describes what that process was like, the challenges, the, uhm, the outcomes of doing that. So participatory action research or ah, it may also be called uhm, community-based participatory research. There are models out there, uhm, and, and guidelines for really how to go about doing these things so I'd encouraged you to, to uhm, expand some of your, ah, research skills and research thinking in those ways. Uhm, we also know how to interpret literature from our own discipline but we may need to stretch ourselves in terms of drawing on knowledge from other disciplines. Uhm, for example, uhm, Azara Santiago-Rivera and colleagues uhm, described the experience of working with environmental racism. And the importance of really being able to draw on, uhm, on policy, on environmental, ah, literature and knowledge, uhm, on working with legal issues within that, and so we really need to be able to, uhm, figure out what databases are out there other than psych info. Uhm, we need to, to learn to read those things or get help in, in reading those things. So we need to think about collaborating, uhm, in an interdisciplinary way in order to achieve some of those goals. Uhm, another piece is that we know how to, uhm, conceptualize what's going on with our clients, uhm, in terms of some of the impact of the environment on them, but we may not really think about what kinds of interventions we can make on that environmental level. And so obviously dealing with environmental racism is one level of the environment. Also uhm, Palombi(ph) and Muntz(ph) talk about, uhm, trying to create a more inclusive uhm, campus environment for, ah, college women with disabilities. And so that's another way we can think about environmental issues in terms of accessibility of our services, uhm, both in term of ah, clinicians' expertise and knowledge in this area but also in terms of the physical environment of our agencies, of our, uhm, of our campuses, of our schools uhm, so, and of our communities. Uhm, so, oh, let me just mention a, a couple of more things that we know how to do, uhm, and, and ways that we can stretch ourselves. We know how to build rapport, and form therapeutic uhm, and educational relationships that are characterized by safety, trust, and respect. But we don't necessarily know how to do that on someone else's turf. So that's a big piece, is thinking about how to build rapport, how to build trust when it's not in our own uhm, classroom. When it's not in our own ah, therapy room, when it's in somebody else's, uhm, environment. Ah, we also uhm, know how to be patient and yet persistent with individual change. Ah, we know we can sometimes take a long time, we know it could be frustrating, and yet we know how to keep working at it. And it's also really important that we think about being persistent uhm, and patient with systemic change. I'm gonna go ahead and stop there 'coz I think we're just out of time. But I just wanna remind all of you that you've got some skills and resources already. There are ways that you could stretch yourself. I have to tell you that in preparation for this, I was looking, you know, through the, through our book and uhm, and, and I got really inspired by reading it and I can say that because I didn't contribute a chapter where I talked about my own work and so I can say I'm really inspired. We had a lot of contributing authors to this who are doing wonderful things, and providing visions and examples and models. And, ah, it's very exciting and so I, I hope all of you will venture into this area.
