DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS Hello, my name is Dr. Debbie Joffe Ellis. And I'm talking about the approach of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. For those of you who haven't seen the other two, just a few words of introduction. I'm a licensed Australian psychologist. I'm licensed as a mental health counselor in New York State. I'm an adjunct professor at Columbia University, TC in New York City. I write… umm… I co-wrote books and… and articles with my late husband, the late, great, Albert Ellis, Ph.D., the pioneer and founder of the… the cognitive revolution in psychology counseling and therapy. And I… I speak with clients and I love, love, love to share about Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy or REBT, which is not only an effective evidence based approach, but for those who choose to adopt it as such a healthy and uplifting way of life. So, umm… it's a pleasure to speak with you and a pleasure to speak with you again, the audience here. And this specific topic of today's presentation is Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, Tools, Techniques and Practice. And by the way for any of the viewers who haven't seen the first or the third of… of these DVDs or any of you who want to increase umm… your understanding or… or awareness of the approach, one of the many books I could recommend is… is this one. It's called Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. Surprise, surprise, umm… co-written by my late husband, Albert Ellis and me. And umm… it… it really is a concise substantial primer on the topic. And my husband put out 85 published books and there are a few manuscripts I'm working to complete that we started work on together before his passing. So, umm… one of the aspects of REBT that you'll remember that I mentioned in our first session together, was that in order to maintain therapeutic gains or maintain self-help gains, it's essential that one makes ongoing effort, ongoing work and practice, work and practice, work and practice. The… The word work can have some sort of loaded commendations(ph). It… It can sound a little heavy, but effort and it can become habitual. And it's habitual for our own good, just like brushing teeth isn't something that most people that, I know of, anyway feel ecstatic about. But it's a habit and they know it's for their good. And they know they'll suffer if they don't do that. And in my view, it's the same with whether it's REBT or living a life infused with a healthy attitude and philosophy. So, to maintain it particularly when rotten things happen and the reality is as REBT reminds us, as Buddhism reminds us, as any school or philosophy that has wise truths within it will remind us, that life contains loss and suffering. But REBT reminds us that if we're willing to make the effort to think in healthy ways and therefore experience healthy emotions, both of which encourage us to act in life enhancing and non self-defeating ways, then we minimize our suffering. And we maximize our joy. And isn't that a goal that most healthy humans would have? Maximum joy and minimum suffering. I don't say no suffering. So REBT reminds us of the helpfulness of being realistic. And if we live long enough we lose things, people we love, you know, probability will die before we do and so forth. So, for ongoing gain, ongoing effort is required. And so a large part of… of the emphasis in today's class will be looking at some of the main tools and techniques of REBT. You know many people, clients and non-clients who have heard about REBT and PEPs(ph) initially were excited about it and saw some benefit have… have said at times that, "I still compulsively go back to my old ways of negative thinking." You know and some become, allow themselves to become self-defeatist and think see I got just got back to it, I'll never change. And REBT reminds us of the importance of continuing to make effort on having high frustration tolerance, and patience, and perseverance. And not have childlike attitudes of, "Well, I've tried it for six weeks, six months. I should be over it by now." Shoot her. Just to keep on, keep on, keep on, relapse, pick yourself up. I… I love this song, whatever it is, I'm not a singer, as… as you'll discover certainly by the end of our time today. You'll see why. But there's this song, you know, pick yourself up, dust yourself off start all over again. I wonder if the person studied REBT, who wrote that song. Anyway, so with perseverance, even deeply embedded habitual… formally habitual ways of thinking, acting and feeling can be changed, can be changed. Okay. So, umm… let's look at some of the cognitive techniques. So, so under the… the umbrella of REBT tools and techniques, there are cognitive, behavioral and emotive. And as you'll hear, there's… there's overlap. You know, most of them are one end another, or some are all three. But we have these… these three categories. And the first one I'll start talking about is cognitive. The first cognitive homework tool technique… And again, these umm… are appropriate to recommend to clients and for self-use. So to recommend to friends and loved ones is to remind ourselves and others to prac… practice mindfulness, to think about our thinking. To bring ourselves back when appropriate with greater focus on the present moment. And if we are experiencing a debilitating, unhelpful emotion to ask ourselves to use the mantra that I mentioned in the first DVD, "What am I telling myself to make myself feel this way?" So, to remember, to… to encourage ourselves and others, to be aware and to think about our thinking. The next cognitive technique suggestion is the use of healthy coping statements. You know, you could use the term affirmations. But I remind you of something, I mentioned in the previous session. These coping statements to… to have most benefit, had better be realistic and not Pollyanna and not too gooee, fluffy everything will be fine. But things are difficult now. Others have survived such… such circumstances. I too have resilience. I choose to continue step by step, for example. So healthy, realistic coping statements. And to repeat them often, often, often, often. You know, a lot of research, fantastic research is now being done in… in the fields of neurophysiology and neuropsychology which support what REBT has reminded us since its birth. That to establish new habits, new circuitry, you know, the research on plasticity and all supports this too. Repetition is necessary. And Al used to give a 30 day minimum timeframe for most of the home works he suggested. And research now supports that period as a helpful time for affording those changes within the brain circuitry in chemistry. So, I mentioned in the past, the… the… the visionary nature of my husband and… and the things he was well aware of even before there was scientific evidence which there now is to support them. So, using these coping statements forcefully and repetitively over a minimum of 30 days and perhaps for the rest of our lives. Okay, the next what we can call cognitive homework or reminder is to utilize and to teach or recommend to others the application of unconditional acceptance, unconditional self-acceptance where we remind ourselves, each one of us that we have worth simply because we're alive. Not because we have certain talents, it's a benefit. Let's enjoy them. Not we, because we have certain advantages, let's enjoy them too. But they don't give us any more worth than a person deprived of those advantages or gifts or talents. So USA is reminding ourselves that we have worth just because we exist. And unconditional other acceptance to remind ourselves or others of the benefit of pushing ourselves to practice unconditional other acceptance when people act in ways we don't prefer. And then ULA, unconditional life acceptance, reminding ourselves that in reality at this point and in the past, life isn't, circumstances in the world aren't going to always be fair and just. But just because many, very bad things are happening in the world and in places, it doesn't mean all of the world and all of life is rotten. To remind ourselves of that. Like to share a story with you. You know, in our last session some of you shared that you enjoyed the story, so I have one more. And it relates to the helpfulness of unconditional life acceptance. So once upon a time, there was a poor old man whose only possession was a white horse. For years his fellow villagers advised him to sell this horse and make a lot of money. The old man refused. "The horse is a part of my family and he don't… you don't sell your family," he said. Now, one night the horse disappeared. And the people said, "You shouldn't have been so stupid, not to absolve the animal." Shouldn't have, listen for should, right. They weren't being rational at the time. Now, you have nothing left old man. A bigger misfortune could not have happened to you. The old men smiled and said "Who knows whether it's a misfortune or not? The only thing I know, is that the horse is gone." A few weeks later the horse returned to the stable and brought 12 other horses with him. Apparently he was a… okay, this isn't in the story. But he was a randy old horse and he looked for female mares and brought them all back. And the villagers said, "Old man, you're right. It was not a misfortune at all. But great good fortune that the animal went away. Now, you're a wealthy man." The old man again smiled and said, "Who knows whether this is a fortune or misfortune? The only thing I know is that the horse came back with 12 other horses." Well in the weeks that followed, the old man, the old man's son, excuse me, tried to tame the horses. And he fell from one of them when he was trying to tame them. And the man's son broke both of his legs. He was a invalid. And would be for the rest of his life and the villagers said, "Indeed, it wasn't such good fortune that the horse bought all those others horses back. You're completely right. Now your son is an invalid. And a bigger misfortune could not have happened to you." Well, the old man, wise old man smiled and countered, "When will you stop pretending as if you know what tomorrow will bring. The only thing I know is that today misfortune has… has befallen me. but that's all I know." Well a few months passed by and a war broke out. And all of the healthy young men in the village had to serve in the Army. The old man's son couldn't go because of his invalid nature, because of his injuries. None of the men who went to war came back alive. And what did the old man say to the villagers when they saw him? So this old man was wisely seeing things and perceiving things the way they were, without exaggerated or unapprovable interpretation. And that's very helpful. And that's part of unconditional life acceptance, to see things as they are and accept, particularly what can't be changed. Alright, back to cognitive techniques, exercises, homework. Looking for the cost of benefit ratio of holding on to irrational beliefs. Will they hurt me or help me? How are they helping me? Cost benefit ratio. Also under cognitive, looking for secondary symptoms. You know, sometimes a client may come in and… and report that they want help in feeling less depressed. And they'll try the homework and come back in future sessions and say I'm not feeling less depressed and that's making me feel more depressed. There's depression about their depression. That's called secondary symptoms, secondary depression in this case. There can be secondary anxiety, secondary other unhelpful emotions. But in this case it would be secondary depression. In which case the therapist would focus on changing that and then going back to the initial depression that the client had the goal of changing. Another homework tool would be the use of distraction methods. Now this is not the most elegant solution. REBT calls the elegant solution, finding the core shoulds and musts and disputing them and working on developing a healthy philosophy of life and living. So distraction methods can be very wise in the short term. For example, if I'm feeling enraged, it's not a good time to tell me the look for my shoulds. So it would be wise to go for a run, do some yoga, distracts me, turn down the temperature of the debilitating emotion to the point where then I'm more able to apply an elegant REBT solution or technique. So, distraction methods, I mentioned in my husband's life as a child when he was quite neglected and felt so sad, he would distract himself from thinking, Why aren't my family members visiting me, by reading books or using imagination and dreaming about great things to come. So, certainly distraction methods have their place. Next, modeling. Thinking of someone who has achieved that which we want to achieve, who perhaps used to feel very anxious and no longer does. And… And… And studying their life and how they affect the change, perhaps how they used REBT. Albert Ellis is a great model. You know, a lot of people say to me when I am in this situation, I think of what would Albert Ellis do, you know. And so finding models, it… it could be a… a spiritual leader, it could be a member of your family or community who's uplifting and who exhibits a way of thinking, feeling and behaving that any of you or your client's may aspire. Do good homework for clients is to ask them perhaps when appropriate to… to name, to think about and in next session bring back the names of people famous or not who are healthy models of the way you want to be more of(ph) the time. Then bibliography, videography, encouraging the client or yourself to read books whether they be REBT or REBT and… and related, other inspiring helpful, doable approaches and philosophies. You know, there are so many videos, and DVDs around. This might be one. So, using videography and DVDs, and bibliography. Teaching REBT to others, some of you are not yet licensed counselors or therapists or psychologists. Possibly, probably some of you will be before very long. But at this stage some of you are not and yet there is nothing stopping you sharing some of this with friends and loved ones when you notice, they're hurting themselves by thinking in ways and feeling ways that don't enhance their lives. A very helpful and important emphasize emphasis that REBT reminds us of the usefulness of is gratitude. And to remember, especially during the tough times and during the good times. Because the more we remind ourselves of what we can be grateful of in our good times, the easier it will be to call forth our ability to be grateful for what still is good in the very tough times. So, I do recommend to people I care about, I do this to myself, I recommend it to clients, to be mindful each day of what still is good, of what there is to be grateful for and about. Okay, so these are some of the main cognitive approaches. Emotive, evocative exercises, home works, approaches. One is called Rational Emotive Imagery where you or your client imagines the worst of a situation that has been troubling. That they've allowed to trouble them, to imagine the worst. And evoke the unhealthy feeling and then by virtue of one's thinking change their unhealthy feeling to less (inaudible ). Now when I do demonstrations, I often will get a volunteer to come up and towards the end of that, I will do REI, Rational Emotive Imagery with that person in the demonstration. But I also do with some clients. Not necessary with all. By the way, I'm giving you a number of variety of techniques and I'm not suggesting that it's advisable to use any and all of them with every person. It's important to have discernment and slow activity. Umm… If someone is in… in the midst of deep grief and trauma, I may not at that time do Rational Emotive Imagery. I'll wait and… and gauze whether and when in my assessment. And by the way it's therapist, we're human. All we can do is the best we can do with good intent. So we better have unconditional self-acceptance too. And… And so and what I'm talking about is choosing techniques for particular clients in particular states, it would be discerning. But back to Rational Emotive Imagery, for many people the worst that can happen is they try to evoke the emotion and… and they don't. No tragedy, nothing lost. The best is self-empowerment. Wow! They've created the… the… feeling and just by pushing themselves to think differently about it, they feel less that way or not that way. Let's take two minutes to try it now. Shall we? Close your eyes, close your eyes. And if there is a troubling situation in your life right now, I invite you to vividly imagine it, picture it at its most intense, at its worst. Whether it's involving a person or a situation and feel the unhelpful feeling that you don't want anymore. Or that you want less of and feel it, feel it, feel it. Feel it as intensely as you can. And now what I invite you to do is to lessen or change that feeling. And when you've done so open your eyes. Well, we have eyes opening here like within, what seven seconds. So, I… I don't know how well you have done and… and of course I'm… I'm being very speedy here because we have a time restriction. But just with the show of hands how many of you were able, even mildly, to change the initial emotion you evoked? All of you. Fantastic. So that's an example of what can be very effective for many people, much of the time. Well, done. Yes, great. Alright another emotive evocative exercise is shame attacking. This is particularly applicable for people who want to feel less socialphobial, less shyness and who are overly concerned about what other people think about them. And so with the shame attacking exercise you would suggest to a person to push themselves to do uncomfortably, what they want to get more comfortable at. And I suggested, I think in the last segment, you know, someone might push themselves if they are very shy to talk to people they don't know or even people they do know, to have the homework once a week, once every two weeks, say hello to a stranger in a safe enough environment, Starbucks or whatever. Be good if I get free coffee from Starbucks from now on. I mention them a few times. Now, umm… so to… to take those steps and umm… not just pushing yourself to do the action, but while doing it, while if it's like talking to a stranger, reminding myself that worst that can happen. They ignore me, I can stand it. It's not terrible. I may not, you know. And so you… the person… you as a therapist would prepare the person, to prepare themselves for the worst which is rejection, which by the way isn't such a worst case scenario, except to the person who's very shy. And so bit by bit, bit by bit. You know in a workshop, Al and I, my husband and I gave, during the lunch break, we suggested to the attendees go and do a shame attack during lunchtime. And afterwards they came back and… and reported what they did. And one of the attendees said that he put a piece of string on his banana. Now where we were working at the time was in the wealthiest part of New York City between at… at the institute between Madison and Park Avenues. And so this person had… had his banana on a string and… and walked down Park Avenue with the banana on a string. And… And luckily one person stopped this person and said, "What are you doing?" And he said, "Well, can't you see I'm taking my banana for a walk." Now, this person had been suffering from social anxiety and had had a number of sessions without leading up to this. But it still was a stretch for him to do it, but he came back elated, that he wasn't bothered at that time, when the person looked at him strangely as a result of having done exercises in the past. It may not happen overnight and usually doesn't. It might for some, but it's not all that common. So work and practice, work and practice. So, shame attacking exercise. Then role play. This can be particularly good if you're doing group therapy, or couples therapy or family therapy. And let's stick with two people and one person is acting in particular ways that the other person is allowing themselves to feel enraged or depressed about one of the or other of those unhealthy emotions. And so what you would invite the doer of those actions to do, would be to act in the way that the person suffering from those emotions would act. And the person suffering from the emotions would act out their partner's way of behavior. And so this can give more objectivity to each one of them. And more compassion and empathy by the way which can be helpful. Let's… Let's do a quickie here. Who wants to be my therapist? This is gonna literally be a quickie. Okay, so Tina, you're my therapist. Well, you take the therapeutic role. We're doing a role play. 

00:29:25
TINA Okay. 

00:29:25
DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS Okay. So, I'm… I'm a person, let's say my issue is I have to give a talking in public. And I'm terrified, I'm very anxious. So you play me. Hello. 

00:29:40
TINA Hello. 

00:29:40
DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS What's the trouble? 

00:29:45
TINA I have to give a talk and I am just terrified. 

00:29:50
DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS What are you telling yourself that is creating the terror? 

00:29:50
TINA (inaudible ), they're going to laugh at me. I'm going to forget everything I need to say. I don't know what to do. 

00:29:55
DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS Okay. Can I stop you there? I haven't come across any evidence that of anyone dying when other people laugh at them. Have you come across the evidence for that? 

00:30:10
TINA No. 

00:30:10
DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS Okay. So it might feel uncomfortable, but will you really die? 

00:30:15
TINA Probably not. 

00:30:15
DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS Probably not. You'll be the first one, you'll be famous. Yeah. Umm… What else might you be telling yourself to create the terror? 

00:30:25
TINA Maybe I don't know enough about what I'm going to speak about. 

00:30:30
DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS Well, let's say you don't know enough. Then? 

00:30:35
TINA Then I guess, I just don't know enough. 

00:30:35
DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS What is the worst thing that will happen as a result of you not knowing enough, which you might not? 

00:30:45
[sil.] 

00:30:50
TINA Umm… Maybe someone ask me a question that I don't know the answer to. 

00:30:50
DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS And if you don't know the answer then? 

00:30:55
TINA Then I'll go and research it. 

00:30:55
DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS Is it the end of the world? 

00:30:55
TINA No. no. 

00:31:00
DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS Okay. Thank you, Tina. So that was a quickie because the clock is ticking. But so I was the ones presumably suffering from the anxiety, but in this role, reverse role play, I was giving you, me, the type of rational thinking that would help me lessen my anxiety. So, obviously this is for individuals who understand and know a bit about REBT. Again whether it's in training or whether it's in a group therapy session, can be very effective. Kido keep. So now finally talking about the tools and techniques, some behavioral ones. In vivo desensitization, already mentioned that pushing oneself to do uncomfortably what one wants to get comfortable at, taking healthy risks, perhaps some skill training, you know, doing public speaking workshops or training in the like. Using reinforcements to help you maintain homework that you're doing. For example, if I was your therapist and… and gave you the homework of doing ABC sheet every night, which by the way the ABC approach of REBT, I described more fully in the first segment of this three segment series. And… And just to refresh us, one identifies the activating event, clarifies the consequence emotional and or behavioral, then looks for the irrational beliefs. Then disputes them, then comes up with effective new philosophies and then does ongoing homework and ongoing umm… effort. So let's say, I've given my client the homework of doing an ABC sheet every night. And to help them along, I might say, "What do you do every day and night that you enjoy?" And the person might say, "Oh, I love chocolate." And so to help them, help themselves you might say," Well, how about you don't have any chocolate till after you do your homework?" So you can suggest that. Relapse prevention. So if one of the person's goals is to lessen their addiction to let's say, unhealthy food. Then relapse prevention could include throwing out everything that's unhealthy, that in the kitchen and… and replacing it with healthy, hopefully pleasant enough food. So to take some action that encourages relapse prevention. It's good to think ahead. Now another what we can call behavioral approach is the use of humor. And Al had a… a very unique and find wit and sense of humor. And he loved writing humorous verse and… and songs. In fact he wrote hundreds of lyrics to what he called Rational humor songs which showed him sort of fallibility in what we can tend to do with ourselves. And what I invite you to do with me now which may or may not be a shame attack. What's the worst thing that can happen? I can already prepare you. If you think the worst thing that can happen is that you'll sing in a lousy form, be prepared. But you probably won't kill anyone. The sound engineers of the DVD, thank you, you can turn the volume down if it's shocking. But I thought we might sing a few, just a couple of Al's rational humorous songs and… and for those of you don't have the words, they are in some of Al's books. Umm… Well, just enjoy our… our little performance here, as you'll… you'll hear. I'm no singer. Well I… I am a singer, just not a good one. Well I'm not a singer. I'm a person who sings. See I caught myself, being aware of my thinking and language. If I was a singer, according to general semantics, I would only sing overtype. How would you like that? You would have been running out of here an hour ago. So, anyway. Umm… Let's sing together. And listen to the humor and the way it points out what we can do in a humorous way, we as humans. Glory, glory hallelujah. So here we go, Albert Ellis's rational humorous song. Mine eyes have seen the glory of relationships that glow. And then it falter by the wayside as love passions come and go. Oh! I've heard of great romances where there is no slightest lull, but I am skeptical! Glory, glory, hallelujah! People love you till they screw ya! If you'd lessen how they do ya. Then don't expect they won't! Glory, glory, hallelujah. People cheer you, then pull, pull ya! If it's often how they screw ya. Then don't expect they won't! You know and… and this to… to me one of the things that highlights is the tendency we can have, if we let ourselves to have expectations and shoulds about others. And if we remind ourselves that they like we are fallible humans, and we prefer what we prefer, but don't demand and expect it, then we're less likely to suffer and be disappointed. Okay. In very fast motion love o, love me, only me. Love o, love me, only me or I will die without you! O, make your love a guarantee. So I can never doubt you! Love me, love me totally, really, really try dear; But if you demand love too, I'll hate you till I die, dear! Love o, love me all the time, quite thoroughly and wholly! My life is slushy slime, unless you love me solely! Love me with great tenderness, with no ifs or buts, dear. If you love me somewhat less, I'll hate your goddamned guts, dear! Hey! So again the tendency that some of us can have to demand, to love, you know, and… and it… it rarely is for our good to demand. Healthy to want, but demand will get us in trouble. All right, so I've shared with you a good number of… of the cognitive and behavioral, and emotive techniques, home works that you can use on yourself, that you can share with others. Umm… REBT is one of the most effective brief therapies. But particularly for highly motivated people who understand it and who will do the homework. Again, change doesn't require understanding a line, it requires understanding and action. To do the action when had better be motivated, will power. But will power alone isn't enough. I'm going to, one had better do what one is going to do. So very successful brief therapy. But as I indicated in… in the last segment that for people suffering from certain psychosis or… or more extreme emotional disturbances, they benefit from long term therapy, you know. And I've had some clients suffering from OCD and… and repetitive behaviors. And umm… And in some cases, it's taken years of individual therapy and then group therapy for them to change that they've changed. And within that time, there were many relapses. And again, so important for the therapist in their life to… to help them unconditionally, accept themselves with the relapse, but motivate them to, you know, pick yourself up and go forward, back to it, back to it. So, change is possible with a person making effort. But with the… the more extreme debilitating conditions, more and longer term therapy will be required. REBT is multi-model. And it works very well with other forms of therapy. As a evidence of that. Next month, I'm doing a workshop, I'm giving a workshop in… in New York City with umm… a great pioneer in the field of transpersonal psychology, Dr Stanley Krippner. He and I, co-edited a book called Perchance to Dream, umm… a research based book on dreams and sleep, you know. And so we're giving a workshop next month on REBT and dreams. Well, dreams, you know, this is very (inaudible ) approach. How does REBT fit with that? Wouldn't Albert Ellis have said that that's too mystical? No! The way they can work together is in this way. Let's say one of your clients is coming to you and… and they suffer from a repeating nightmare. And they wake up feeling panic or anxiety. And… And the nightmare itself might be, you know, woo-woo, and not based on reality or it may based on… be based on real time circumstances in their life either all. So what an REBT therapist can do? If the emotions following the nightmare or… or dreams are sustained by the person in their waking life because they are dwelling on it, is to ask that same old question. So what are you telling yourself to create that emotion, whether it's within your dream or about the dream? Or the fact that you keep having the dream, you know. And chercher should for those of you understand French, chercher, to look for, la should, la should. And to… to dispute it. And so Stan… Stanley Krippner will… will talk about elements of… of dream work and… and myths and all that. And I share, REBT. And helping people, if they allow themselves to succumb and maintain disturbing emotions that distract us from greater joy and tranquility in our everyday lives. So, umm… in… in just a few minutes, I will look forward to answering, if I can, any of your questions. But in… in closing this segment, I just want to recap the importance and benefit of practicing some aspects of REBT. If you're a client between sessions, if you're a human being, every day of your life of… of that finite life, to maintain joy, to stabilize their selves during turbulent times, to minimize suffering, maximize happiness. Thank you. So think about some questions. 

00:43:30
UNKNOWN Yes I have a question. It seems that this approach works very well with clients who have insight and are willing participants in the therapeutic process. But I was wondering how REBT worked with either mandated clients or… or clients who have little insight or don't think that they have a problem really and it's the world around them. 

00:43:55
DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS That's an excellent question. By the way, a number of people with narcissistic tendencies will blame the world around them because in their glorious perfection, you know, the world and others don't measure up. Look, all I, you can do as a therapist or… or an individual helping others who aren't clients is the best that one can do. And it goes back to what I mentioned earlier, umm… the role that a… that a person can do their best to take of being a motivator. By presenting to the person the bigger picture and the consequences of, "Okay, continue thinking in this way and doing what you're doing and the consequences will probably be the same as what they are. Like you'll be sent back to jail and then be court mandated to come here. Where is that getting you? Is it helping you or hurting you? Or… Or someone who's compelled to go back to a behavior in a way of thinking that they really want to change and then they've just, they're lazy with their home work and they come back and… So by patiently exhibiting unconditional other acceptance, not what's wrong with you? You know, you aren't just not doing it good enough? Not do that, but say, "Okay, well, if I thought the way you thought, I… I wouldn't do anything either to change. And I would suffer for the rest of my life from the same condition that is not really helping me, but hurting me." And so all we can do is the best we can do to give them motivation to make choices in their best interests. We cannot force it, you know. And on the other hand, let's persist still there is enough evidence over time, that it's a mismatch and… and nothing is being gained. I mentioned earlier modeling as umm… as one of the techniques and approaches. And umm… in the very first DVD in these three part series, I talked about how, when one practices the principles of REBT, one becomes an authentic model. And so it's very helpful if the therapist can do the best, they can do to practice what they preach. I'm gonna talk more about that in the third DVD in this series. So do your best to motivate them, show them the pictures objectively as you can. Tell them, if you don't change whatever's not working for you is unlikely to change. Is that what you want? Your choice. Yes. 

00:46:55
UNKNOWN Yes. With respect to relationships, you mentioned differences and preferences. And I'm wondering how do you know, whether… whether to explore those differences or whether two people just don't belong together? 

00:47:05
DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS Well what do you mean by belong together? 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN They… They're incompatible, let's say. 

00:47:15
DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS One of the things that might be helpful for each of them to explore are their wants, their desires for the relationship. And any tendencies they have to damn the other person, to have low frustration tolerance over the other person. To consider, it sounds very clinical, the cost benefit ratio of staying together. Are there more advantages than disadvantages? REBT, if a couple comes in, in conflict would actually unless there's physical trauma involved in which case, separate. And then possibly work on whatever, but… but with the exception of that, if a couple come in, in conflict, REBT suggests that over a period of time, they work on staying together in the discomfort doing home work, practicing ABCs on their own shoulds and demands, practicing appreciating each day what the other person is doing that's positive and helpful and appealing, practicing each day to develop higher frustration tolerance. So, people in intense conflict who come in, would be encouraged to… to see this as an experiment, get clear on your expectations, get clear on your wants. How much are you willing to compromise? And over time seeing the success or failure of attempts, they make a more informed decision about whether to cohabitate, stay together or not. And hopefully if the answer is no, we better not to end as friends, or at least not in disharmony. Thanks for your questions, thanks for being here. Thanks for being there.
