00:01:04
TERRY REAL I'm great, Rich. Thanks for having me. 

00:01:04
RICH SIMON Alright, so let's just get right into it. So, um, what's wrong with our conventional therapeutic thinking, and, perhaps even more, our conventional therapeutic approaches to working with men? 

00:01:19
TERRY REAL Well, I think that, um, we lie, basically (laughs) is what's wrong. I think that, uh, there are a number of things that are wrong, but I think that one of them is, uh, that, uh, a lot of men are reticent to get into a therapeutic endeavor, uh, because they see it as a chick thing. Uh, and, uh, a lot of therapists have been taught to say, "Oh, no, no, Mr. Jones, uh, this is totally even. You're both, uh, your both equal Steven here. And, uh, this is not, uh, a gender biased activity. Now, Mr. Jones, I want you to open up your heart, tell us how you're feeling, and be vulnerable." 

00:01:59
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:01:59
TERRY REAL And, uh, men are not that stupid. Men know that, (laughs) that, that therapy is going to ask them to get in touch with their softer, quote, unquote, more emotional sides, and, uh, they're resistant. One of the things we do, in the work that I do called RLT, Relational Life Therapy, uh, is, uh, we put this asymmetry on the table. Therapy is not, uh, a gender neutral endeavor. Therapy, intimacy itself, under traditional patriarchy, is coded as feminine. Uh, intimacy itself is a chick flick, and, uh, so, uh, we don't try and soft pedal that. 

00:02:44
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:02:44
TERRY REAL Uh we put it on the table and deal with it. That's one of the first things that we do that's very different. 

00:02:49
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:02:49
TERRY REAL Uh, and then the other, as you know, Rich, cuz we've had many conversations, is the therapeutic use of self, the way that we use ourselves as therapists with men, uh, is very, very different from the conventional, um, therapy that we've all grown up with. So, there, there are a number of differences in the way we work. 

00:03:04
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Alright, so, so, one of the things that you talk about in using, uh, a language that is not widespread in our field is you, you, you, uh, a term that is particularly, uh, seems central to the way that you work with men is your ideas about leverage. 

00:03:29
TERRY REAL Yeah. 

00:03:29
RICH SIMON So, talk to us about leverage, and getting leverage with male clients. What is leverage, and why is it so important? 

00:03:34
TERRY REAL Okay, so, um, in order to understand, uh, leverage, we have to back up a bit and understand a few things about, uh, grandiosity. 

00:03:44
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:03:44
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Uh, because, um, I believe that, while this is a broad generalization, and I admit it's a broad generalization, uh, generally speaking, women in our culture tend to lead from the one down, kind of, shamed victim position and have covert issues of grandiosity, whereas men tend to lead from the one-up, uh, grandiose position and have covert issues of shame. That's not always true, but it's often true. And so, what you're gonna be dealing with, what's gonna hit you in the face when you're dealing with a lot of men, uh, is, uh, one-up grandiosity. And a couple of things to say about grandiosity, and then you'll understand why leverage is so important. The key thing to understand about grandiosity is that, unlike a shame state, when you're in a shame state you know it, you feel bad about it, you're motivated to get out. When you're in a grandiose state, think mania and bi-polar disorder. 

00:04:39
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:04:44
TERRY REAL Uh, when you're in a grandiose state, half the times you don't know it, and frankly, it doesn't feel bad. It often feels good. 

00:04:49
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:04:49
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) It feels good to get intoxicated. It feels good to lose control and start making out with your secretary. It feel, you know, the things we do that get us into trouble, we do even though they get us into trouble. But we're not so stupid that those things feel bad. They feel good. So, grandiosity feels good and it impairs judgment. Specifically, it impairs your judgment in terms of the impact you're having on others. Again, think mania. And it impairs your judgment in terms of negative consequences. We have to take, uh, people who are in a manic episode and lock them up because they're libel to start skating in traffic, or something. They just, their judgment of negative consequences is skewed. So, if you have a guy who's riding in the one-up grandiose position, his judgment is impaired about sensitivity to others, his judgment is impaired about negative consequences, and he's not feeling bad. Ergo sum, you add all this up, and you don't have an incredibly motivated guy. So, uh, one of the things we say is that feeling, uh, basing your therapy on, uh, particularly grandiose based guy's, uh, good will is what we call, and let me know if this is too technical for ya. 

00:06:09
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:06:09
TERRY REAL What we call, thin ice. 

00:06:09
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:06:09
TERRY REAL It is thin ice. And so, rather than, uh, basing our therapy on nurturing this guy, and loving this guy, and having this guy love us. Uh, we do all that, and we like all that, and that's very important, but it's step two. 

00:06:24
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:06:29
TERRY REAL Step one is answering the following question, it's a question that the guy will be having about you, which is: why should he be putting up with you? And the answer why he should be putting up with you had better be that you have something he wants, and that you stand between him and negative consequences he doesn't want. And that's leverage. It's carrot and stick. If you have something that the guy really wants and you can help him with it. 

00:06:59
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:06:59
TERRY REAL If you stand between him and negative consequences that he very much doesn't want, like, for example, losing his wife and kids, uh, that's all great stuff. And that's what we need in order to begin to work with the guy. 

00:07:14
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. So, at, uh, one of the, uh, less flattering descriptions that you make of standard therapeutic practice is that in, too often the therapist, whether male or female, is behaving like the wife in relation to the, to the male client. 

00:07:34
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Yes. 

00:07:34
RICH SIMON Now, what do you mean by that? 

00:07:34
TERRY REAL Well, I think that, uh, you know, Virginia Goldner in her classic article, Feminism and Family Therapy, said, "If you, uh, understand only one ting from a gender perspective understand this, that historically women's participation in the domestic life of the family, uh, has been mandatory whereas men's has been discretionary." This is not to criticize men. 

00:07:59
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:07:59
TERRY REAL It's a historical fact. And what men bring into the therapy room, uh, is the same privilege that they bring into the bedroom and to the living room, which is to flee. They can leave. 

00:08:09
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:08:14
TERRY REAL You know, um, uh, you know that book, uh, that Estes book, uh, Women Who Run With the Wolves? 

00:08:19
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:08:19
TERRY REAL One of my female patients wanted me to write a book and call it Men Who Flee With the Ferrets. 

00:08:24
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:08:24
TERRY REAL Uh, so, men can take off, and women are intimidated by that. 

00:08:29
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:08:29
TERRY REAL And, uh, under the guise of winning the man's trust, forming an alliance, uh, winning them over, I believe that we therapists have been taught to, in essence, replicate the traditional wife role. We're intimidated by the same, uh force of blowing up or fleeing that women are as a, as a class. 

00:08:49
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:08:49
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) And we're taught to essentially to play the men like fish rather than deal with them in a forthright manor, which I think works better. 

00:08:59
RICH SIMON Mm-kay. Now, so, uh, before we move on, in, it's, say a little bit more about what you mean by grandiosity. Cuz every guy does not stride into our, uh, office behaving like Donald Trump. So, gr-, gra-, gra-, grandiosity has different faces. So, when you say, "grandiose," some of the wh-, uh, some, uh, of the actual behavior of the guy may not appear grandiose. 

00:09:29
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:09:29
RICH SIMON So, give us a little bit of kind of the range of behaviors that you're, uh, that you're lumping under, under that broad umbrella. 

00:09:34
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Sure. Sure. Well, grandiosity, you know, it's just the opposite of shame. There isn't one self-esteem issue, there are two. 

00:09:39
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:09:44
TERRY REAL You can be one down in the same state, you can be one-up in the superior, grandiose state. It means looking down your nose at somebody. It means being contemptuous, which can be quite mild contempt, like sarcasm, but it's still contempt. 

00:09:54
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:09:54
TERRY REAL Uh, it means feeling contemptuous of the rules, feeling entitled, feeling above the rules. 

00:09:59
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:09:59
TERRY REAL Uh, so you put all of that together, and, uh, any behavior that looks like, uh, verbal abuse, any behavior that looks like, uh, shaming somebody, or making fun of somebody, or making them feel like they're stupid, uh, any form of entitled behavior, uh, addictive behavior, drinking, uh, womanizing, uh, feeling like you don't have to play by the same rules everybody else plays. All of these behaviors are, uh, grandiose in my book. So, you don't have to be Donald Trump in order to be grandiose. 

00:10:34
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:10:34
TERRY REAL You know, uh, I, I'm here to say I wanna take, uh, narcissism and grandiosity, uh, out of the closet. 

00:10:44
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:10:44
TERRY REAL Uh, uh, I'm fond of saying that I'm the founding member and the president of the NLF, the Narcissist Liberation Front. 

00:10:49
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:10:54
TERRY REAL Which is an organization unique in that every member is the founding member and the president. Uh, we all have issues of both shame and grandiosity. It runs the range of both sides from very severe to relatively mild. But here's the thing, you can't be intimate from either the one down shame position or the one-up grandiose position, no matter how mild. 

00:11:19
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:11:19
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) And, uh, therapy has done a terrific job of helping people coming up from the one-down of shame. That's really been our focus for 50 years. 

00:11:24
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:11:29
TERRY REAL But we've done a terrible job of helping people come down from the one-up from grandiosity. And I believe that helping people come down from the one-up, uh, is critical if you're going to lead people into true intimacy. And it's critical if you're going to work with men because so many men lead from that position. 

00:11:49
RICH SIMON Okay, So, this is, the webcast is, is really, our focus here is on practical tools. On giving, uh, representing the range of ways in which people actually operate in the consulting room with men. And so, given what we've just said, let's talk about how this gets communicated to a guy, either the, the, the male client who, for some reason, is coming in as an individual client. 

00:12:19
TERRY REAL Okay. 

00:12:19
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh, with whatever motivation, there's a gun at his head. Uh, or... 

00:12:24
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Yeah, I say, I tell people that, uh, most male clients are what I call wife mandated referrals. 

00:12:29
RICH SIMON Yeah. And, and often, in your case, I, uh, uh, I think the, the, the bulk of your practice is work with couples, as I understand it. So, um, much of the time, if not most of the time, uh, you're working with men in the context of couples therapy. So, give us the flavor of how you begin to deliver these messages, and how you structure, in particular, very concretely, how you stru-, how you might structure a first interview. 

00:12:59
TERRY REAL Okay, fine. So, um, uh, you know, I have a saying, uh, when, um, I'm dealing with a woman, uh, in trouble, my first move is most often to empower the woman. When I'm dealing with a man in trouble, uh, my first move, most often, is to empower the woman. 

00:13:14
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:13:19
TERRY REAL And, uh, you know, let's face it, this is where that even-Steven stuff is really just a fairy tale. Uh, if I had a nickel for every guy who called me up and said, "Gee, Terry, I've just gotta drag my wife into therapy (laughs) because we're not as close as we used to be." I would not be able to retire. So, the first order of business is recognizing the asymmetry that is common. 

00:13:39
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:13:44
TERRY REAL Not, uh, every case, but more cases than not, 

00:13:44
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:13:44
TERRY REAL It's the woman who's dissatisfied, it's the woman who's picked up the phone, it's the woman who is, in some cases, dragging her guy in to see you. So, uh, that gets acknowledged. And, uh, I always start of the same, uh, with the same question in my sessions. Uh, I say, "If this session were to be a stunning success, what would it get you? What would it net you?" 

00:14:09
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:14:09
TERRY REAL Uh, and, uh, I'll often start with the woman. I'll say, "Whoever called, you, you, your call." And, uh, at first I'll get usually vague, you know, better communication, or more closeness, we're too distant, whatever. Uh, I hear from both of them, uh, and then I start to drill down. Uh, and I drill into, uh, usually, uh, the woman's complaints if she's the lead dissatisfied one. 

00:14:34
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:14:34
TERRY REAL Uh, which is most common. And it sounds something like this, if I had a magic wand and I could change Rich to be exactly the husband you wished him to be, uh, what would be different? 

00:14:49
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:14:49
TERRY REAL What would, what would change? The, the woman's complaints, uh, we find, uh, uh, we find, uh, by and large, are legitimate. And, uh, it's a rare woman, I mean, women can be exaggerated in what they're saying, and they can be focused on the negative and leave out a lot of the positive, that's all true. But by and large there's a, there's a broader canvas here. And the broader canvas is this, uh, women, by and large, want more intimacy from us guys than most of us men have been trained to deliver, uh, and in many cases, even want, uh, but certainly not deliver. There's an a-, there are too many of us. Uh, so, in someways this isn't a personal issue, in someways this is a cultural, uh, issue. 

00:15:39
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:15:39
TERRY REAL Women drag in men to therapy because they find the men insufficiently intimate and/or they find the men to behave in ways that are somewhat insufferable. Uh, and they're really dragging these guys in for us to teach them, uh, how to be, uh, kinder, gentler husband/ father units. How to be more relational. And, uh, we, uh, would take that on. And we take sides. Uh, when I grew up, if you lost your quote, unquote "therapeutic neutrality," particularly if you sided with the woman against the man, you had to go into supervision and talk about your mother for a while. 

00:16:19
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:16:19
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) You know, and then once you got yourself sorted out you'd go back into your neutrality. And we think that that's grotesque. We call it like we see it. You know, you could have, uh, a, we'll say a guy, it could be either, but we'll say a guy. You could have a guy, uh, who's a raging, untreated, bi-polar, alcoholic, uh, verbal abuser, and the woman's contribution, her side of the dilemma is that she's there. Uh, and, uh, this is the feminist critique of family therapy, that, uh, you don't talk about abusive situations as a fifty-fifty contribution. There's something grotesque, uh, about doing that. Uh, so we're perfectly capable of, after we size things up, of saying, "Okay, uh, Mrs. Jones, uh, you're 30% of the problem, Mr. Jones, you're 70% of the problem." 

00:17:14
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:17:14
TERRY REAL "Mrs. Jones, you're a nut, Mr. Jones, you're an even bigger nut." 

00:17:19
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:17:19
TERRY REAL And, uh, we call it like we see it, and it's not 50-50. So, that's one of the big differences between the way we operate and traditional therapy. 

00:17:29
RICH SIMON G-, g-, go back for a second, so, you, you're, uh, you, you were talking about how you start, the magic wand, and asking the woman what it is that she would like to see different. Uh, and, uh, and then, uh, often, as you're saying, you, you, she's, uh, your experience, uh, the wife is often telling it like it is, and there's some, uh, there's intimacy that isn't happening in the relationship which she's disappointed in. What do the guys say? 

00:17:54
TERRY REAL Well, you know, women are no angels, uh, in this either. Uh, women are kind of, uh, often bearing the torch of saying they want more intimacy, but they're not behaving in ways, uh, that really, uh, uh, uh, created a lot of women, uh, move into what I call angry pursuit, uh, which is in some ways an oxymoron. It's the totally dysfunctional to, uh, try and get more closeness by complaining about not getting it. 

00:18:24
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:18:24
TERRY REAL Uh, a lot of women, but the time I see them and you see them, have, uh, given up to varying degrees and have withdrawn, maybe withdrawn sexually, withdrawn some of their affection, uh, and the men feel that. And so, the men, uh, basically have a varia-, you know, look, the truth is, I, I, I, people come to, the idea with couples on the brink of break, people come in from around the country. This is my thing, is the last ditch attempts, two day intervention with couples who are on the verge of divorce. And even in these cases, Rich, when I peal the guy off and speak to him one on one, it, I get a hundred variations of this: hey, uh, Terry, uh, you know what? Uh, it really isn't all that bad around here. If you could just kind of get her, you know, to... 

00:19:14
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Off my case. 

00:19:14
TERRY REAL Off my back, I think we'd be fine. 

00:19:19
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:19:19
TERRY REAL These guys are hanging by marital death door and they don't think that it's a big problem. It is women who carry the dissatisfaction. 

00:19:29
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:19:29
TERRY REAL Men, and this is one of the things I say, uh, "Men are not unhappy with their women. Men are unhappy that the women are unhappy with them." 

00:19:39
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. (laughs) Bit of Zen wisdom. 

00:19:44
TERRY REAL (laughs) Yes, my son. 

00:19:44
RICH SIMON (laughs) Parallel therapists (inaudible ) our office. Wise man say. So, alright, so, let's go back into that first session. So, you're getting this initial sense of what, what people are looking for from you. 

00:19:59
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:19:59
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:19:59
TERRY REAL Yeah. What, what women are looking for, what men are looking for is a warmer, less nagging, less complaining woman. 

00:20:09
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:20:09
TERRY REAL Uh, by and large, and what women are looking for is a total (laughs) brain overhaul. Women are really looking for their guys to be, uh, much more relational than, uh, many of the men that I see have been raised to be. 

00:20:24
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:20:24
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) It's not their fault. I normalize this. This is not, uh, uh, an exercise in personal shaming. 

00:20:34
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:20:34
TERRY REAL It's not their fault. But the truth is that, uh, what women are asking for is legitimate. We agree with them nine out of 10 times. You could be closer, you could be nicer, you could drink less. Whatever it is, uh, by and large, women's complaints are legitimate. So, uh, we, what we move into is leverage. Uh, so, we say to the woman, uh, and by the by, I'm doing this straight up, let me acknowledge there are many role reversals. There are many incidents where the guy is casper milquetoast and the woman is a witch, there are many incidents where they're both pretty blatant with each other, but I'm gonna say two outta three times it plays out in this gender specific way. So, 

00:21:19
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:21:19
TERRY REAL So, uh, let's say the woman's complaints are legitimate. You're sitting there and you're thinking, yeah, I couldn't live with that either if I was you. Uh, well, we find a way of saying that. But before we do we have to empower that woman. We have to say things to her like, "If this doesn't get better, what's going to happen? What are you," uh, in essence, while we may not use these words precisely, what are you prepared to do to stand up to this guy, stand up for what you're saying you're not satisfied with? And, uh, be willing, in some ways, to make him uncomfortable, uh, in a way that is consistent with what you really feel. You know, a lot of women, uh, get into what I call, I hate how you're treating me, uh, what can I make you for dinner? And the first thing we do with this empow-, 

00:22:19
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) We, we have another sampler of (inaudible ) A lot of these things, huh? 

00:22:22
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) They, they're fo-, fortune cookies. Little fortune cookies. 

00:22:24
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:22:24
TERRY REAL (laughs) This is coming, this is from working on television, you know, you gotta get it all in one phrase. Um, (laughs) any, any rate, uh, a lot of women move into that. And what we tell women is, we want you, minimally, to be consistent. 

00:22:39
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:22:39
TERRY REAL Uh, we want you to stop being passive aggressive, and we want you to speak softly and carry a big stick. What is going to happen if this doesn't get better? And the bottom line of what's going to happen if this doesn't get better, of course, is, I'll pack up the kids and I'll leave, and I'll throw your butt out. But there's a whole range of behaviors that the woman can engage in to send a message to the guy that she means business that, uh, fall short of that and are not abusive. Uh, and, there's, there's a whole spectrum of, just saying that you're unhappy. You know, I had the classic example of the woman coming in saying she couldn't get the guy into therapy because he refused to go. Okay, so, this was the intervention. True story. For seven days, no more, she met the guy at the door with fo-, her version of the following: honey, I hate how you're treating me. I hate this, I hate this, I hate this, and I hate this. And I made an appointment with this guy, Terry Real, next Thursday at 9pm. I expect you to get your butt in that chair. If you don't, I'll be even more unhappy, and even more miserable, and more angry at you that I am, and I'm already considerably all three of those things. So, I really wouldn't wish it on you. Now, what can I make you for dinner? 

00:23:59
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:23:59
TERRY REAL She met the guy at the door with this. What was it, 90 seconds, uh, seven days? That Thursday at 9:00 that guy was in my office for dinner. 

00:24:09
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:24:09
TERRY REAL (laughs) I'm not preten-, for therapy. So, (laughs) he already had dinner. So, um, there's a whole of, um, helping the person with the dissatisfaction, we'll say the woman, really mean business. When that's clear, when the negative consequences of staying the way you are is clear to the guy, he ha-, he has been softened up. 

00:24:34
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:24:34
TERRY REAL And then the work moves into him. Okay, Mr. Jones, Mrs. Jones has been really clear about what she's dissatisfied with, how long she's been dissatisfied, and what's gonna happen if things don't change around here. What do you need, and let me talk about what's going on. So, after we get leverage from the woman, then we move into the guy, uh, and that's kind of phase two. 

00:24:59
RICH SIMON Okay, so let's, we'll go to that in a second. Uh, say, two things, one is how soon within a first interview do you begin to look at these, uh, focus in on this issue of leverage, and begin to develop it? And, and maybe just take, say a little bit more about some of the varieties of ways in which you begin to develop leverage, particularly through the wife's dissatisfaction. 

00:25:29
TERRY REAL Well, um, eh, the first order of business, uh, we call it data gathering and making relational diagnosis. So, before you come charging in you have to get a sense of what's going on. 

00:25:44
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:25:44
TERRY REAL And, uh, the way we do that is what we call making their realities collide. Mrs. Jones, what's your beef? Mr. Jones, what's your beef? Uh, we don't automatically assume that Mrs. Jones is right. As I said earlier, that, that comes out in the wash. But let's say that she is. When then get them to use specific examples of, uh, what their beef is, you know. 

00:26:04
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:26:09
TERRY REAL So, for example, uh, her beef about him is that, uh, he's volatile, he screams at the kids, uh, he drinks too much, uh, and he's, uh, chronically two or three hours, uh. late. And, uh, her, his bitch about her, uh, is that (laughs) she's not as warm as she used to be. 

00:26:24
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:26:29
TERRY REAL Uh, you know, these, these, uh, these stories are not always as symmetrical. But let's say they are. 

00:26:34
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:26:34
TERRY REAL We try and get them into specific examples of what their complaints are. We go back and forth between the two, and we get the lay of the land, and we make a decision about what we see as, uh, what's right or what's wrong. Once we decide who's who and what's what, we call, we talk about the latent and the blatant. Once we decide who the latent is and who the blatant is, say it's the woman who's the latent and the man who is the blatant, then we move, once we figure out what's going on, then we move into empowering the latent. In this case, the woman. And we do this right in front of the guy, uh, and it sounds, uh, something like uh, 

00:27:09
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:27:14
TERRY REAL What is going to happen if this doesn't change? What are you prepared to do? Uh, uh, how do you see this playing out? And, um, nine times out of 10 the woman, first of all, as I tell my students, you already have leverage. If the woman didn't have leverage over the man you wouldn't be seeing him in the therapy office. So, already there's been some exertion, uh, some way in which this gal has gotten this guy to do something he doesn't particularly want to do, which is come see you. It, that's what you want more of. And so, uh, in subtle ways you are amplifying her, uh, unhappiness, uh, amplifying her resolve to do something about it, and amplifying whatever plans she hasto do something about it. You're taking this all very, very seriously. Oh my gosh. So, you're saying that you're already thinking about possibly leaving. Uh, do you think he knows that? 

00:28:14
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:28:14
TERRY REAL No, I've never said that. So, this is news. Yeah, Mr. Jones, what's it like to hear her say that? Have you ever heard her say that? So, you're doing all this amplification of both her dissatisfaction and her resolve to do something about it. That's the essence of empowering he latent. 

00:28:34
RICH SIMON Okay, alright. So, you've established, an-, and then, some of these other ways, so the, uh, i-, i-, just va-, variety, perhaps, some, some of the more, the range of ways in which this, the, uh, leverage and negative consequences get expressed. 

00:28:49
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Can work? Yeah, sure. So, um, uh, it can be anything from as simple as, uh, if you're unhappy, start acting like you're unhappy, stop pretending. 

00:28:59
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:28:59
TERRY REAL Uh, to, uh, you, uh, start to withdraw services. 

00:29:04
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:29:04
TERRY REAL Uh, you stop cooking for the guy, you stop cleaning for the guy, you stop picking up his shirts, to, uh, you stop having sex with him, to, uh, you, uh, move into separate bedrooms, to, and actually this one is one of the most, uh, uh, uh, one of the ways that gets, uh, men's attention the most, uh, you refuse to go out with him socially. I don't feel like we're a couple, uh, I don't feel like you treat me like a couple, I'm not going to pretend that we're a couple, so, you're on your own. Uh, and then, ultimately to an in-house, uh, divorce, a total separation inside the home, and then finally, uh, an actual separation outside the home. These are all steps that, uh, I guarantee you will get men's attention in big ways. 

00:29:54
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:29:54
TERRY REAL Uh, that fall short of pack you bags and get out. 

00:29:59
RICH SIMON So, when the, the husband here hear's this, and, and give us a sense, and their, whatever their thoughts were about psychotherapy, they're not expecting, I would think, for the most part, that this kind of conversation begins to unfold. So, what happens? What, what, uh, what's, what's the look on the guy's face, and, more importantly, what kinds of responses you get as the conversation, the therapeutic conversation turns in this direction? 

00:30:29
TERRY REAL Well, um, there are two, basically. Either the guy will discount what he's hearing, uh, oh yeah, I've heard this a million times before, you know, she doesn't really mean it. Uh, in which case you go back to, uh, the leverage and you help him understand that this time it's different. She really does mean it, by getting the material from her. Uh, he thinks that you don't mean it, should he think that? Oh, no, this time, you know, you just get it from her. Um, uh, or, more commonly, uh, if the guy's got his head screwed on straight and he cares about the gal, uh, he's thinking to himself some version of, shit, (laughs) this is serious. This is a, I had, I didn't really get until this minute, uh, I mean, I'm in deeper doo doo than I thought I was. And, um, uh, the, nine out of 10 guys, when they hear this, particularly if you're going back and forth and helping them hear it, uh, will take it very seriously, uh, and will find it appropriately, uh, disturbing. That's good. They should be disturbed by it. That's what you're after. 

00:31:34
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:31:34
TERRY REAL So, uh, nine out of 10 times, uh, uh, if it's legit, coming from the woman's point of view, the guy, you know, one of the things we say, Rich, is that we believe that traditional therapy treats guys as if they're fragile and, uh, as if they're idiots. And we believe that guys, by and large, are well-meaning and not stupid. And if you put stuff on the table, they'll get it, they'll deal with it. And so, nine out of 10 times that a guy hears his woman talking with this level of dissatisfaction, and this level of resolve, he's sober, he's disturbed. 

00:32:14
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:32:14
TERRY REAL And, um, he, uh, is, starts to move in the direction of, what do I need to do to make this better? Which is where we want him. 

00:32:24
RICH SIMON Now, you're the catalyst, as the therapist, for a conversation he may not have heard before. 

00:32:29
TERRY REAL (laughs) Yeah, he notices. 

00:32:29
RICH SIMON So, what is it, what do you get, uh, you know, uh, from your, uh, your male clients? The ones, the, the less polite male clients who do, uh, 

00:32:39
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:32:39
RICH SIMON What do you get in the way of, hey, wait a minute, where is this going here? 

00:32:44
TERRY REAL You know, what's remarkable is, the people that have the most difficulty with this moment, and it's a very tough moment. It's the toughest of the therapy is when you're gathering leverage and it's being pressed. The guy is being pressed, and you're facilitating that. The people who have the hardest time with that are therapists. The guys, uh, have a much less hard time with, now, they don't love me when I'm doing that. You know, they, they, they like me the least in all of the therapy in that particular moment. Ans as a therapist I have to tolerate not being loved by the guy in that moment. 

00:33:19
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:33:24
TERRY REAL His turn will come, he'll love me later. 

00:33:24
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:33:24
TERRY REAL But, um, uh, but the guys, here, here's the thing, traditionally what we're taught to do with men, uh, in both the, uh, uh, along the range of men, but in particularly with grandiose men, is to love them to death. To be really nurturing and nice to them. 

00:33:44
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:33:44
TERRY REAL To move them into their underlying trauma, to deal with their wounded child, and, you know, the idea is that if you do all of that the grandiosity and the bad behavior will just somehow dissolve and melt. And so, the therapeutic action is really about lovin' the guy up. 

00:33:59
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:33:59
TERRY REAL And in RLT we believe that you can love up somebody who's in a grandiose position till you're blue in the face, uh, and it's not going to dissolve the grandiosity. That's a fairy tale. 

00:34:09
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:34:09
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) The grandiosity has to be dealt with per se. So, our therapy is not based on love in that sense. It's, the therapeutic action is not that we nurture and empathize with the guy. The therapeutic action is that we can help him to learn to be more relational. And in this early phase where he's kind of waking up to the fact that, shit, I'd better do something about this, he doesn't love me as a therapist, but actually, uh, as a surprise to us therapists, I'm not really central in his thinking at that moment. 

00:34:44
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:34:44
TERRY REAL He's thinking, I might lose my wife, or, I might have to wash my own shirts, or whatever it is that he's begunning, beginning to think. 

00:34:54
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:34:54
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) He's not thinking, oh my God, this guy's really jackin' up my wife and stickin' it to me. He's not thinking that, by and large. He is legitimately concerned about what he's just heard from the woman he loved. 

00:35:09
RICH SIMON So, uh, you, uh, therapy has begun, you, you've as-, assessed what's goin' on, you be-, you are intervene here in a way that may-, is designed, carefully designed to get the guy's attention. You're changing the rules of the game. You're making it hard for the game to continue the way it has. 

00:35:24
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Yes. 

00:35:29
RICH SIMON And then, then where so you go with this? Where's, what's the next, the next step, what's the therapy? 

00:35:34
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Well, in some ways all of that is, all of that is preamble. 

00:35:34
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:35:34
TERRY REAL Uh, you know, all that's just clearing away the underbrush so that you have a captive audience when you're talking to the guy, and he's not just half listening or discounting, uh, three quarters of what you're saying. 

00:35:49
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:35:49
TERRY REAL So, once you have the guy kind of softened up and in the palm of your hands a little bit, then you move into to what we call joining through the truth. 

00:35:59
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:35:59
TERRY REAL Joining through the truth. In form-, see, in traditional therapy the idea is that first you form an alliance with the guy, which could last for two, three, four years. An-, and then, once you, quote, unquote, "win the man's trust," then you tell him the difficult truths. And in our RLT, we form an alliance with the guy by telling him the difficult truths right out of the starting gate. So, we will begin to talk to the man about what we see him doing that is getting in the way of him having the relationship that he wants to have with his wife and his kids. We tell the truth to this guy about what we're seeing. And there, of course, is an art and a skill to that. We have a two year training program. The, the, the phrase that we use, we don't like the word confronting, that's too aggressive. I like the phrase, joining through the truth. 

00:36:54
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:36:54
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) There's two parts of that. Part of that is telling the truth, but the art of this is telling the truth to men in a way that makes them fell that you're on their side. In a way that makes them feel joined, joint, in a way that makes them feel joined with, uh, even while, uh, you're, uh, helping the, you're holding the mirror up to them about some of the difficult things they're doing. That's the second phase, and in some ways the most critical part of this. 

00:37:24
RICH SIMON So, so, how does that sound? So, what are the kinds of things that you say in that, as it unfolds, in that stage of things? 

00:37:34
TERRY REAL Well, I'll tell you two stories. 

00:37:34
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:37:34
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) I'll tell you a quick one and a less, uh, quick one. The quick one is, so, uh, uh, uh, I've told before in, in, our, but I, I just love this story so much. That Harvey is this kinda MIT, you know, captain of the universe. 

00:37:49
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:37:49
TERRY REAL He's in therapy because his wife, uh, won't make love to him, He has virtually no friends, his family doesn't particularly like him, and his kids are pretty distant from him. So, uh, that's the set up, right? And he's in there and he's talking to me about how nobody's close to him, and he's doing this sort of MIT, no offense, but this kind of nerd self-stimulating, rocking thing. 

00:38:09
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:38:09
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) And he's got a little pimple on his nose. And he's popping the pimple on his nose, and little rivulets of blood are, like, dropping. 

00:38:19
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:38:19
TERRY REAL And so, what I say to Harvey is something I, as a social work student I would have gotten into trouble for saying. I look at him and I go, Harvey, your nose. What you're doing with your nose. It's disgusting. (laughs) 

00:38:34
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:38:34
TERRY REAL And Harvey looks at me like. Oh, huh, uh, yeah. okay. So, uh, we tell the truth. That's an extreme example, but we tell the truth to guys about what they're doing. 

00:38:49
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:38:49
TERRY REAL Look, I said, "Harvey, you're complaining that no one in your life is close to you. Let's take a look at the ways in which you're behaving that repel people. That push people away from being close to you." 

00:38:59
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:38:59
TERRY REAL "You have something to do with this." And while it's a funny story, I have to tell you, it was the turning point in our therapy. And I don't know how I could sit through a therapy with somebody doing that and not comment on, uh, what they were, this is the therapy, that he does stuff like this around other, uh, around other people. 

00:39:19
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:39:19
TERRY REAL To tell you a, a less extreme, uh, version. 

00:39:24
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. Okay. 

00:39:24
TERRY REAL Uh, I just had a guy in my office yesterday. Uh, there was a big thunderstorm. His, uh, 16 year old daughter, uh, was, uh, with her boyfriend at a house, and she was scared, she was too frightened by the thunderstorm to drive home. She's a new driver. Her, her mother thinks this is a marvelous thing that the girl has called, and been vulnerable, and stayed out of the car in a dangerous situation. Father thinks it's fine. The mother thinks that the girl is scared, either she or the father should go pick her up. She's got a, a really, right, she just threw her back out, she can't do it. She asks the husband to do it. He's tired. He says, "No, I'm not gonna do it." "Let's send a cab." he says, "Let's send a driver." And the wife says, "No, I, I think one of us should go." He says, "That's ridiculous. The problem is she needs to go home. Let's get her home, and end of problem." The wife winds up getting out of her, uh, bed with her bad back, and driving through the rain to pick up her daughter. The guy thinks the wife is being totally irrational. Okay, this is a good example of taking sides. 

00:40:34
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:40:34
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Who's right and who's wrong. 

00:40:34
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:40:34
TERRY REAL She's right, and he's wrong. 

00:40:39
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:40:39
TERRY REAL And here's why. 

00:40:39
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:40:39
TERRY REAL He defined the problem as getting the girl home. He totally blocked out was, uh, oblivious to, uh, the emotional concerns of the mother around the girl's fear and her feeling that a parent needed to show up for her. That even though she was older, uh, she needed some TLC. He didn't have to agree with that. In that regard he isn't wrong. 

00:41:04
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:41:04
TERRY REAL They both have pl-, I say, "I could take 100 people, and 50 of them would agree with you and 50 then would agree with you." 

00:41:09
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:41:14
TERRY REAL What he didn't do was he didn't treat her concerns with any degree of seriousness. He said, "You're being irrational. This is nonsensical. Uh, blah, blah, blah, I'm tired, I'm not going, that this solves the problem." and he didn't hear a word that she said. That's a level of insensitivity that is driving his wife berserk, and he doesn't see it. He didn't see it, and it's my job to help him see it, which I did. I slowed it down, I talked to him, I said, "She's right, you're wrong, and here is why." And by the end of the conversation he got it. He understood. Now, as you might anticipate, in his family growing up none of this kind of nurture existed, and he learned how to be totally instrumental and to ignore these things. It works really well for him at his high finance job where he's busy bossing people around all day. And I had to teach him that this is not going to work with your wife and your kids. They need a softer, kinder, more sensitive, more connected you. And then I did something, Rich, which I do with virtually all the guys I see at one point or another. I create, I work to create cleavage between, uh, the guy, the core of the guy, the best part of the guy, what we call the functional adult part of the guy. 

00:42:39
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:42:39
TERRY REAL And these insensitive or grandiose behaviors. So, it, uh, after I do my teaching I say tot he guy, "Look, Bill, you are a decent man." Oh, no I'm not. "Yes, you are. You're a decent man, you've got a big heart, and you love your wife and kids. I've been with guys who are not decent, and they're cold, but you're warm. You're fun to be with. I talk to you, you take it in. You're a connected nice guy. What we have here that's so sad is we have a decent man who's been behaving in some ways insensitively and indecently for the last 15 years. Your wife and you kids are totally turned off to you. This is not who you really are. Let me work with who you really are and extricate that from this nonsense, because I think we can do it." 

00:43:34
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:43:34
TERRY REAL Now, who's gonna say no to that? And, in fact, he didn't say no to that. He said, "Okay, teach me what to do and I'll do it." Which is what 99 out of 100 guys say. If you put it to them straight, and you send them a lifeline, this is where you're shooting yourself in the foot, this is what not shooting yourself in the foot looks like. I'm gonna help you get from A to B. I'll be right by your side. They're in. That's the experience I've had. 

00:44:04
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) So, back, back up from that for a second, cuz that sounds, that really seems like that, there's, there's the purer wet, there's the, uh, the art and the craft of pulling this off. Cuz the, this is the piece of it I would think most therapists don't think, that if they can, if they tell the truth in the way that, as you see it, that the clients are gonna sit there. So, how are you, how are you doing this? What is it that you're, uh, and not just, just implicitly, but what have you learned about, uh, better ways to deliver that message, as opposed to messages that just in-, uh, get the guy to be oppositional? 

00:44:49
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Right. Well, there, there's, uh, I mean, we have two years worth of training in answering that one question, but I'll give you some tips. 

00:44:54
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Sure. Yeah. Good. 

00:44:54
TERRY REAL First of all, I, I include myself. I'm not above them. And so, if, if they have issues with insensitivity, so do I. I often say to guys, which is true. 

00:45:04
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:45:04
TERRY REAL That relationality is my second language. 

00:45:04
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:45:09
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Selfishness is my first language. And I have to think my way through to be a kinder, gentler, more connected guy. This does not come naturally. So, we include ourselves. But also as men and women, we, we're not above you. We're in the mud with you. 

00:45:24
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:45:24
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Uh, we're no better than you are. We normalize. This is not just you, this is happening to guys all over the country. There are millions of you. This is not just your personal problem. 

00:45:34
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:45:34
TERRY REAL The job description has changed. Nobody asked our fathers and grandfathers to be this kind of connected, and intimate, and sensitive. Sorry, (laughs) you know, I wish that none of these changes had happened, but they have, and now it's time to re-engineer. 

00:45:49
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:45:49
TERRY REAL Uh, we move up in the family of origin. And, uh, so, uh, for example, if I have a rager who's the son of a rager, uh, I'll move them affectively back to that experience. I'll be, what was that like? who was the rager in your family? My mom. Okay, who did she rage at? My dad. What did he do? What was it like for you as you were watching that rage? And, uh, we get them, you know, they get pretty emotional at that, at these moments. We then say, "Hey, look, you may not remember this, but I'll bet there was a moment when you looked at your raging mom and you said, 'When I grow up and I'm a man, I'm an adult, I'm never going to bring this into my family.' You probably don't remember." And, you know what? Nine out of 10 times they say, "No, I do remember." 

00:46:39
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:46:39
TERRY REAL "I remember exactly the moment. I was 6 years old and I was standing by the dining room table and I," wow, you remember that. What was that like? Well, it was blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Then you get to deliver your payload. Hey, Bill, it must make you sick to now realize that you have become your mother. 

00:46:59
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:46:59
TERRY REAL And they say, "Yeah, it does make me sick." And the beauty of that therapeutic conversation is it didn't make them sick five minutes ago. We talk about helping the guy, we'll say guy, helping the guy, uh, develop an allergy, uh, to his own, dysfunctional behaviors. In analytical language, it moves from being ego syntonic to ego dystonic. Um, and, uh, we talk about the negative consequences with the wife, but we also very much talk about changing the multi-generational legacy, and sparing the children the kind of pain that you yourself went through when you were a kid on the receiving end of the same behaviors that you are now dishing out. The third thing that we do is, as I said before, is we reach into the decent part of the person, the functional adult part of the person, and we, we, pull for that. Look, I know that you don't want to behave this way. I know that you love your wife and kids. I know that you don't want to suffer these consequences. 

00:48:04
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:48:09
TERRY REAL It's not you. Uh, the grandiosity is a visitation that occurred to you in childhood. You should have been parented differently and better. Uh, you should have learned these lessons when you were 4, 5, and 6. And so, now you have to schlep to Boston and deal with me learn them now, you poor guy. 

00:48:24
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:48:24
TERRY REAL You poor guy. And we call this a-, a-, a-, working this attitude, oh, you poor perpetrator. 

00:48:34
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:48:34
TERRY REAL You know, when, when I first, uh, studied, uh, and started working with men there was a split in the field, which is still true. There were domestic violence programs and some feminist programs that helped men responsible for their offensive behaviors, but didn't love them very much. 

00:48:54
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:48:54
TERRY REAL Then there were 99% of the other programs that loved men to death, but didn't deal with their offensive behaviors. And what, uh, what I wanted to created was a way of holding men accountably and lovingly at the same time. And it really helps to go back to their childhoods where the grandiosity was first forged. You know, look, if my dad is screaming at me, on the receiving end I'm being disempowered. We call that disempowered abuse. 

00:49:24
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:49:24
TERRY REAL And that leaves issues of shame. But I'm also being given the message that when I grow up and I'm a big guy, I get pissed off, I get to yell and scream at everybody too. I can be shameless. 

00:49:34
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:49:34
TERRY REAL And that leads to grandiosity. And, uh, by looking at both issues of disempowerment and false empowerment we can say things to guys like, "Oh, you were set up to. You were set up to be entitled." or, "You were set up to be angry." or, "You were set up to be shameless in these ways. It's what you grew up with. It's what you saw. It's what you internalized, you poor guy." 

00:50:04
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:50:04
TERRY REAL And so, it's both truly, sincerely holding that wounded part of them empathically, and holding that difficult part of them accountably in the same breath. That's what we're shooting for. 

00:50:19
RICH SIMON So, when you look at, over the years, and as you model has developed, you've, you've developed the various tools that you use and you try to distinguish between those cases, those people you've gotten through and those where it just doesn't work, this doesn't register, what have you learned? 

00:50:44
TERRY REAL Well... 

00:50:44
RICH SIMON What keeps people from, um, responding to this message? Both either your limitation or the limitation of your, your clients. 

00:50:54
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah, well, one of the things that we, uh, believe is it's less about how much the clients love you, and it's more about leverage. Uh, Les Havens once said, "The goal of a first interview is a second interview." 

00:51:04
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:51:04
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) And, uh, we-, uh, you can, you can be schmoozy with a, with a grandiose guy and they may not show up for the, the next session. If you have leverage with a grandiose guy, they'll show up the next session cuz they have to. 

00:51:19
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. Huh. 

00:51:19
TERRY REAL So, uh, you know, one of, one of the things I say is you can, as a supervisor, you can be, like, dead hung over and barely listening to anything, and barely prevent a stuck case, lift up your head and go, you don't have enough leverage, that's why your stuck. And have everybody go, oh my gosh, that's right. And you could do this every time. 

00:51:39
RICH SIMON Huh. 

00:51:39
TERRY REAL So, uh, the limits are the limits of the leverage. If we have a very grandiose person, not moderately, but seriously grandiose person, uh, and we have, uh, and enabler who simply will not stand up to them in any way, shape, or form, we don't have a case. No leverage, no case. Or, if we have a, a, a Donald Trump type, and, uh, he, he is about to lose his wife and kids, but he's got 24 year old Muffy off to the side, you know, to, to run to. 

00:52:09
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:52:09
TERRY REAL He may not care about the negative consequences. 

00:52:09
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:52:14
TERRY REAL So, if you don't have any leverage and you have an extremely grandiose person, the therapy is pretty much a sham. 

00:52:19
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:52:19
TERRY REAL We send these guys off to analytic work and pray for, (laughs) we hope for the best. 

00:52:24
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:52:24
TERRY REAL But that's the limits of RLT. That is our dilemma(ph) 

00:52:24
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-kay. So, we, we, we have about five minutes left, so let's see if we can give people, um, uh, something of a broader view of where this goes. That one concept that you've written about in the magazine that seems really central to the entire, the ongoing processes, what you, what you label consciousness one and consciousness two. 

00:52:54
TERRY REAL Yeah. 

00:52:54
RICH SIMON As the learning, as the kind of a key, another key pivot in the process of change. Talk to us a bit about consciousness one and two and why it matters. 

00:53:04
TERRY REAL Well, the context for, uh, first and second consciousness is that what we're doing, uh, with men is we're literally teaching them how to be more relational. We're coaching them and we're teaching them. We're confronting, if you will, what they're doing that's not relational, or anti-relational. And then we're breaking down particular skills, like how to identify your feelings, how to go after what you want, how to fight fair. I mean, the same kind of skills that, uh, couples therapists across the country teach people. Uh, we're downloading all that. But in order for a man to use these skills, he has to be centered in the part of him that wants to. You know, in our, in, we do an essential skills course, and, uh, what, my favorite slide in the course is this, uh, other workshops teach you skills, we deal with the part of you that won't use them. And so, uh, I talk about first and second consciousness. 

00:54:04
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:54:04
TERRY REAL Your first knee-jerk response, you're whoosh that comes up through your body, uh, which is either fight, flight, or fix as a rule. 

00:54:14
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:54:14
TERRY REAL Uh, and, uh, and then, reaching for that pre-frontal cortex, reaching for the functional adult part of you that says, "Terry, wait, slow down." you know, "Don't get triggered." or "Deal with your triggering, breath into your heart, get centered. Okay, now use a skill." So, my beef with the straight educational approach to this is, uh, is only that, uh, functional adult part of us that wants to use these skills, that wants to be intimate. So, the first order of business before you can use any skills is to teach people to get themselves centered and into the place where they're open to it to begin with. Uh, that's the missing piece that I find to the educational, uh, approach to this. 

00:54:59
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:54:59
TERRY REAL Uh, so it's really about cultivating the muscle of reaching for the better part of you in the heat of battle over, and over, and over again. 

00:55:09
RICH SIMON Okay. S-, s-, and this is I know a question you get all the time. Um, you've were talking about therapy with men. You were talking about how you use the fact that you're a guy, and that's a key part of how you get through, and, and, uh, normalize, and, and join, soften the blow. 

00:55:29
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:55:29
RICH SIMON Most people, if it's like most of our conferences and our webcasts, that are listening to this, are women. 

00:55:39
TERRY REAL Yes. 

00:55:39
RICH SIMON What do you, what do you say to women about using these tools and how they may need to, perhaps, adapt the tools as you've, uh, given, uh, as you've demonstrated for us in order for them to be effective? 

00:55:49
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Right, yeah. Yeah, well, you know, uh, my message to women is, go girls. Uh, uh, don't disempower yourself. A lot of women will say, "Well, you can get away with this, uh, getting up front, uh, and in somebody, a guy's face cuz you're a guy. And if I was a girl, and as a woman I'd be discounted." Yes and no. Uh, the, the, the people that I send my most difficult guys to are women. Uh, the people I've trained are mostly women. You know, 

00:56:19
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:56:19
TERRY REAL Pia, Pia Mellody is one of my great mentors. I call her a cowgirl. And she's perfectly capable of looking at a guy, 

00:56:24
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:56:24
TERRY REAL She'll look at a guy and give him a big smile and go, now, what you're doin' right now is called comin' on like a garlic mouthwash. (laughs) 

00:56:34
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:56:34
TERRY REAL And my wife, Belinda, who, a family therapist who's the other one I send people to is perfectly capable of looking at a guy, giving him a beautiful charming smile and going, you know, speaking as a woman, what you just did, that's really disgusting. 

00:56:49
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:56:49
TERRY REAL Uh, you're not going to get her in bed if you behave this way. I know, I'm a woman. 

00:56:54
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:56:54
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) So, there are advantages and disadvantages to either sex, but one of the things I say, Rich, is, "By and large, competence trumps gender." If you, if the guy feels like he, if the guy feels like he's in hot water, you are competent. You can throw him a way out of this. You can throw him a lifeline. He'll take it, and that's more important to him than if you're a man or a woman. The hardest part is helping women move into this level of assertiveness and authority cuz it goes against their training. But I've been very impressed with, uh, how many women can do this and be quite bold, uh, and quite truth-telling, and, uh, get over whatever those early socialization issues were. 

00:57:39
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:57:44
TERRY REAL Women can do this just fine. 

00:57:44
RICH SIMON So, su-, su-, speaking of this, uh, and as we've, uh, come to the end of, of this conversation, people who are interested in resources, finding out about more about your work, training opportunities, things to read, where do they go? 

00:57:59
TERRY REAL Uh, they, the, the place to go is just to go to my website, uh, terryreal.com, uh, will get you there. Just use my name. Uh, one of the simplest things you can do is join a teleclass. Uh, I routinely give teleclasses for therapists all over the country. You pick up the phone, you're on a big party line with, you know, 20, 30 other therapists. 

00:58:19
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:58:19
TERRY REAL Uh, we have trainings in Boston and other cities around the, the country. Uh, I do all the trainings myself, at this point. And, um, come and join us, and learn more about it. 

00:58:34
RICH SIMON Okay, great. And so, and, uh, so, and it's, uh, just say the name of your website again. 

00:58:39
TERRY REAL Just use my name, terryreal.com, T-E-R-R-Y-R-E-A-L dot com, and you'll get there. 

00:58:44
RICH SIMON Okay. So, as, uh, we'd like to in-, invite people who are intrigued by Terry's work and wanna continue this conversation in different sorts of ways. One is, there's a comment board for this class. Both for yourself, put into language what you learned, what questions you had, what can, how the dots got connected for you. Just click on the, uh, below the, uh, images here and you'll be able to, uh, share your comments. It would be great to get comments and conversations going within our group. Uh, Terry has agreed to come up and look at the comment board, and if so moved, he may respond. And given what you've heard today it'd be an interesting, 

00:59:29
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) I'll do my best. 

00:59:29
RICH SIMON Maybe have some more of those samplers that he has on his wall, gnomic sayings that he might wanna share with us. Uh, but in any way, in any case, as we know, the, the main, important thing is not so much the conversation here, but how the conversation ripples out beyond today. Terry, thank you so much for a, a very intriguing look at your work and its implications, and some of the ways in which it goes against some of the conven-, the operating assumptions within our field. I really enjoyed it. 

00:59:59
TERRY REAL (crosstalk) Thank you, Rich. It's been great. 

00:59:59
RICH SIMON Uh, that's it for now. Uh, see you next time. Uh, Rich Simon from Networker Webcasts. Bye bye.
