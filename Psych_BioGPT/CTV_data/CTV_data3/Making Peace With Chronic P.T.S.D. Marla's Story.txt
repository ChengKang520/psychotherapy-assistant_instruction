Making Peace with Chronic PTSD: Marla's Story 

00:00:00
NARRATOR This is Marla Handy's story, shared with psychiatrist Frank Ochberg. 

00:00:05
Dedicated to everyone who believes that she or he is the only one. You're not. Marla Handy 

00:00:05
This is a presentation of Gift From Within 

00:00:05
NARRATOR Frank Ochberg is a psychiatrist and the former Associate Director of the National Institute of Mental Health and a member of the team that wrote the medical definition for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. He was the editor of America's first PTSD treatment text and is a recipient of the lifetime achievement award from the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies. Marla lives with chronic and complex PTSD, a result of child abuse by a family member and further trauma from a predator when she was a young adult. She has just published an enlightening book titled "No Comfort Zone" that describes what occurred and how she copes. 

00:00:55
MARLA HANDY  This is not a memoir. I don't know you well enough for that. In fact, I'm not sure I know my own past well enough for that. This is about my today. My every day. I want you to know something about what it's like to live my life. I often don't react to life's events like most of you and the roots of my reactions are not obvious. I have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, a condition most often associated with war veterans. Unfortunately, it is also prevalent here on the home front among those of us who have seen the really ugly side of life: sex abuse, rape, captivity, exploitation, the threat of harm to loved ones. We get damaged in the same way, it just takes us longer to get diagnosed. 

00:01:40
MARLA HANDY You know the book actually started out as an essay, and it's... what became the second chapter of the book, which is Comfort and Fear. And it was my attempt to... to some degree explain to myself how I felt different from other people. And a lot of my own teaching and training and management training and such always uses the term comfort zone as that's the, uh, the default safe place and, you know, in order to grow, in order to move you've gotta' get beyond that. Somehow staying in your comfort zone is a negative, and, um, ] the fact is I don't think that there is a comfort zone. 

00:02:30
FRANK OCHBERG  And, and I think a lot of people have the fantasy that they can go home, and home will be safe. You know, soldiers dying on the battlefield are calling for mother. They're, they're... they want that safe nest. Your nest was not safe. 

00:02:45
MARLA HANDY  At the breakfast table one morning, my father ended a seemingly calm discussion with my mother by throwing a cup of scalding hot coffee into the face of my younger sibling who was sitting in a high chair next to him. He never even looked at the baby. As my mother jumped up to care for their screaming child he said something to the effect of, "I told you I was done talking about this," and walked off. I felt guilty because I hadn't been paying enough attention to stop this from happening. We were all supposed to watch out for the baby. I knew that. I was eight or nine. 

00:03:20
[music] 

00:03:20
What were the early childhood traumas you experienced? 

00:03:20
MARLA HANDY  I have a very clear sense of having broken at a certain age, and through a series of experiences. I had, uh, sexual abuse and other traumatic experiences at a younger age, but right around 12, 13, I broke. And to me that means the past and the present sort of split, and sometimes the past would kind of take over the present and my sense of continuity in time started feeling chopped up. Life became more random, or it... I experienced it as more random, and I experienced my reactions to it as more random. 

00:04:15
FRANK OCHBERG  Can I pick up on that? I mean, there's a Antonovsky(ph) who writes about a sense of coherence, and coherence, perhaps, is something we take for granted. A, a sense that it all makes sense and that we make sense and that there's some march through time and the past precedes the present and you look forward to a future. The, the... all of that has its place and its rhythm and its harmony and you trust it. 

00:04:55
[music] 

00:04:55
Was writing the book helpful? 

00:04:55
MARLA HANDY And actually a lot of people have asked me if writing the book was cathartic, and my definition of cathartic means that somehow you're, um, expelling feelings outward as you go, and that wasn't it at all. For me it was far more a matter of organizing, and the way that I've come to think of it since it's been, um, finished is almost more in the matter of... When you think about a hard drive on a computer and having memories and, you know, data are just thrown on the hard drive, and if it gets clogged you have less and less free space to just move and to live your life. In some ways writing the book was more like defragmenting my hard drive, which meant sort of compressing it, organizing it, making it less likely that I was going to trip over something on a daily basis. But, it didn't feel like an emotional process. Some chapters were harder to write than others, but it didn't feel like... a cleansing? Which I guess is what I tend to think about in terms of being cathartic. It was maybe more intellectual and organizing, and organizational than that. 

00:07:10
[music] 

00:07:10
What are the symptoms that comprise Post Traumatic Stress Disorder? 

00:07:10
FRANK OCHBERG If you wanted a thumbnail definition of PTSD, it's three different sets of problems, and they coexist. They overlap. One feeds into the other, but the three different sets are, first of all, having trauma memories rather than normal autobiographical memories of something terrible that happened. A trauma memory doesn't work like our usual memory in which we decide to think about it, and it comes up on our screen of consciousness, and there it is; last Christmas, uh, the summer vacation of three years ago. It's in the past. We judge it to be in the past. We have comfort with it. A trauma memory announces itself. It comes when we don't want it to. It may not even be a full memory, it may just be a vague feeling. It can come in the form of a nightmare. When it's a flashback, you dissociate. You've lost your usual state of consciousness, and it's here and now and it's happening, and it could be dangerous. I mean you could be a soldier and you have a flashback and you could kill a family member. It's not the same thing as crazy, psychotic, but it's serious. So, that's the first part of the PTSD. Your memory system isn't working the way it should. It's dialing up hot memories. They bleed out of the outline . They're more intense. They're scary. 

00:08:45
MARLA HANDY I feel like I trip over.. 

00:08:45
FRANK OCHBERG Well, you were just describing to me a situation that you were thinking about somebody else and what she went through and all of the sudden you were on the verge of going into a trance-like state. Well, that's trauma memory kicking in. 

00:09:05
MARLA HANDY Yeah. And it.. It wasn't the experience that I was describing as having, uh, read an interview of a woman who had been raped at knife point, which was very.. too similar to my experience of having been raped. And I could feel that being brought up . I could do some things to try to manage the situations or the intensity of it, but I had no choice about, "Oh yes, that reminds me of this." And it's the.. it's the feeling of having tripped over memories, though, is the thing that ended up feeling , um, you know more random and more dangerous, I guess I want to say, in terms of just living life and then suddenly being, I don't want to say someplace else, but the.. A flood of intensity that has nothing to do with the here and now. 

00:10:00
FRANK OCHBERG  And, and let me comment on that. I might not have made it clear enough in my previous statement. It's not as though these trauma memories are more accurate, and because they're so intense you really are seeing what actually happened. In fact, there are often a lot of distortions. The memory system is not the normal memory system. And what Marla described to me was a lot of sensation that she had and she was wondering, was she picking up this other woman's feelings? See I... I don't think she was clearly back surviving her own rape in her early 20s, but.. 

00:10:40
MARLA HANDY I... I don't either. I mean I.. 

00:10:45
FRANK OCHBERG (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:10:45
MARLA HANDY (crosstalk) I didn't. No. No, it... 

00:10:45
FRANK OCHBERG But the trauma memory system was working at that time. 

00:10:50
MARLA HANDY (crosstalk)Yes. 

00:10:50
FRANK OCHBERG That's the point. Well, let me go on and briefly mention the other two dimensions. That's dimension number one: trauma memory rather than autobiographical memory of bad things. The second part of PTSD is, is being less than you were, less than you want to be. It's, it's sometimes actually being numb, not having feeling. Sometimes it's, it gets described to me in such a poignant way it's, "Doc, I know I love my daughter, I just don't feel it the way I should." So, the capacity for feeling is muted, it's blunted. And then people don't do what they used to do because they're not all there. They don't want to see their friends. They certainly don't want to go to happy occasions where people will interact with them. And they're not gonna' have their full personality, and they know it. But, the last part of PTSD is being generally nervous. Your set point for vigilance has been changed. You know, you're the, I have one patient, he says, "I am the ball turret gunner. I'm always out there. I never stop, I can never rest." So, that means he can't sleep, he can't concentrate. You're easily startled. You're hyper-vigilant. It also means usually you're angry. This stuff is causing your nerves to rattle, and people can rattle you. Um, so that whole paragraph of PTSD , it's the "D" paragraph of PTSD. That's the high adrenaline part of it. PTSD is paragraph A: You've experienced a traumatic event, one or more. It was real. When it happened you were horrified or terrified or helpless at the time. That's A. B is something's happened to your memory system and you have these hot trauma memories. C is you've been numbed. Your avoidant. You're less than you were in terms of total humanity and responsiveness. And I don't mean total humanity in you're, you're an unkind or an unfeeling person. You can still care very, very deeply, but you don't have the same automatic responsiveness you'd like to have. And, and the last part is high anxiety. 

00:13:20
[music] 

00:13:20
How has the diagnosis evolved since PTSD first appeared in the DSM? 

00:13:20
FRANK OCHBERG  Well, the situation is the same. We've had DSM 3, 3R, 4, and now the drafts of DSM 5. PTSD has not changed in a significant way, so if you had PTSD back in 1980 and we captured it with that diagnosis you have it now, it's the same thing. But, it's the researchers, the academicians, and some of the therapists who want to be sure that what they see in PTSD is stated explicitly in the diagnosis. So, for example, uh, we don't have survivor guilt in the diagnosis and it's such an issue for people whose trauma is a trauma of not dying when somebody close to them did. And they feel guilty about being spared. Is that part of PTSD? Well, it's certainly a very important part of the traumatic experience for some people, so there'll be something that gets a little closer to that in the next definition. The big change that happened in my tenure with the committee was we first thought that trauma was something outside the realm of usual human experience. And we used those words. And we found out if you live long enough, this will happen. The odds are you'll experience this. So, it's not, it's not outside the realm of a given lifetime, but it isn't something that's gonna' happen every day. 

00:15:05
[music] 

00:15:05
How has the latest brain science changed how we think about PTSD? 

00:15:05
FRANK OCHBERG  Well, the latest science is brain science, and it comes from neuro-imaging. So, we can finally have pictures of the human brain as it's thinking, as it's feeling, as it's working. Or, as it is at rest. 

00:15:25
MARLA HANDY It has always felt physiological to me, if I want to say that. Um, part..part of my struggle as I attempted to figure out why I felt broken, um, was trying to figure out or, and identify, uh, with therapists and other experiences, uh, with people, what's wrong? What's missing? And understanding that there is actually something that's happened to me physiologically, or whether I was predisposed that way, whatever. Somehow it comes down to.. It doesn't matter, it's how I am. And so I accommodate my life and such to where it, I manage it, I accommodate it, but somehow having something come through and be able to have markers or something physically is reassuring. 

00:16:30
FRANK OCHBERG  And I am fascinated with a whole new form of brain imaging called the MEG. It looks - it's magneto encephalogram - it looks at the electrical activity. The electrons passing in your head, and it's very subtle, and it's very complicated. And a wonderful Greek neuroscientist now in America, Apostolos Georgopoulos, has discovered that with people who have flashbacks, unwanted experiences, traumatic memories, something is different in the way their brain works. And, uh, I think this has all kinds of promise. I think Georgopoulos is getting at the unwanted memory that comes back when you don't want it to come back. That excites me. 

00:17:25
MARLA HANDY When I was eight my dad and I would sit out on the front step at night in summer, since I wasn't sleeping anyway. Once he flipped his cigarette butt on the asphalt drive and told me to go put it out with my foot. I was barefoot. I hesitated, but he kept encouraging me. "Go on, you can do it." Eventually, I thought maybe I could, and I knew that if I did he would be so proud of me and my toughness. It took a while for me to get up my nerve, but I walked over and stepped on the ember. And immediately jumped off. It hurt like hell. He laughed and laughed at me because I was so stupid that I would do such a thing. 

00:18:05
[music] 

00:18:05
What is the relationship between chronic and complex PTSD? 

00:18:05
FRANK OCHBERG  OK. There's no simple PTSD. PTSD is not simple, and simple is not in the, uh, in the dictionary of diagnostic terms. PTSD is. Then, if it lasts more than three months, it's chronic PTSD. And if it lasts more than three months, the odds are it's gonna last a year. And if it lasts a year, the odds are it's gonna last more years. So, chronic means it's with you, and it's hard to feel cured of it. 

00:18:45
MARLA HANDY  So you learn to live with it. 

00:18:50
FRANK OCHBERG Say more about that. 

00:18:50
MARLA HANDY I am diagnosed with chronic PTSD. I strongly relate to aspects of what has been defined as complex PTSD, although it's, it's not real yet in terms of being in the, um, diagnostic manual. 

00:19:10
FRANK OCHBERG Uh, there are articles written about it, Judith Herman is the one who gas really put the concept on the map, but others have followed. And it means, to us who are learning about this condition, that the person's trauma happened over a long period of time, or it happened in their formative years. And the result is what Marla talks about in most of her book. That's different from having a prolonged response to one or two traumatic events. So, so chronic PTSD could be a single trauma, but the result lasts a long time. Complex PTSD means the trauma itself was complex. You were held hostage, um, you were brought up in a family with systematic abuse . Uh, trauma that happened repetitively or under conditions of confinement or through the formative years, can result in something called complex PTSD. 

00:20:20
MARLA HANDY For people like me who have not had a single traumatic event where I can mark a before and after, uh, I think having something that's actually recognizable in this way is particularly affirming of my reality, which is one of the things that, um, gets fuzzy. When you're not experiencing the world like other people, and other people are telling you how you should be or that all you need to do in order to feel better is X. 

00:20:55
FRANK OCHBERG I think what your book does is it helps those people in particular who have the combination of childhood abuse and neglect and trauma situations as an adult, and that's not a trivial part of the population. 

00:21:10
MARLA HANDY There... there is this component, and I'm gonna' talk about it in terms of trust, um, I have come to believe that I am incapable, so far, of trusting to the depth that other people are often able to trust. 

00:21:30
FRANK OCHBERG That rings so true to me in working with survivors of incest because in the case of incest it's, it's usually the father or the mother's second husband or boyfriend, and the saddest thing about incest is the loss of trust for your mom. That should be a, a beautiful relationship. I mean, a mother-daughter relationship, and there's incest that involves boys as well, but it, it's the mother that brings us into the world, who offers us the nourishment. And if you can't trust your mother to protect you and you can't talk to her because this boyfriend has said, "She won't believe you," uh, and "I'll kill you," or any kind of threat, that's what's lost. And, we didn't really articulate that in creating the PTSD diagnosis, but we certainly know that coming from an abusive family, incest or something else, creates this distrust with the non-offending parent. The non-offending parent, no matter how good they were, we kept the incest secret from them, and that is there to contend with the rest of your life. 

00:22:55
MARLA HANDY When I was thirteen, my dad decided I hadn't dried the dishes well enough. He removed my pillow from its pillowcase and replaced it with all the flatware from the drawers and all the chopping knives. . He put the sack of randomly sharp hardware at the top of my bed, ordered me to put my head on it, and said I needed to sleep that way all night. He would keep my door open and check periodically to make sure I hadn't cheated and moved off the metal. Of course, I was terrorized and awake all night. 

00:23:30
[music] 

00:23:30
Can you describe what it's like to live with chronic PTSD?? 

00:23:30
MARLA HANDY PTSD is a part of me. This is my, this is my life. I I can manage it, and I've worked with this, but I.. For me, accepting that rather than thinking that I have to figure out how do I run away from, or grow out of, or what do I do. It's this is, this is my body, this is the programming that's happened. I have whatever changes happened in my brain as a result of this. This, this is my house. And I feel like I live in a haunted house. I never know when that rush of adrenaline's gonna come. I never know what's around the corner. And that's what I live with. And so this is, it's a matter of how do I learn to live with this more comfortably? Before I knew what PTSD was and that I had it, I generally considered that to be my messiness. And thinking about it as, it's the part of me that didn't fit in, didn't know how to react to the right times and places. . There,Ae and I... I was deeply ashamed of it. I would say part of the therapy that I attempted and the counseling that I had, I often experienced a, sort of a gap analysis, meaning I was presented with, "If you're healthy then you will react in this way." And I'm not reacting in that way, and therefore that's sort of my messiness. And no matter how much therapy I got, I would still sometimes end up cowering in a corner. And - after being triggered - and.. Had I flunked therapy? I mean, it was this inherent sense of, of it not working, or it being messy , whereas once I understood what was going on with PTSD, that helped make sense of that. I often feel like it's learning to live with PTSD, and I see that as being a mix of almost like living with a condition that is similar to diabetes in that in needs a certain amount of conscious management. So, thinking about what are triggers for me, what might be tension-causing, and what I need to do to take care of myself to maintain a certain equilibrium. And the other condition that I think it's similar to is epilepsy, in that it's learning to live with a certain randomness. So, when I think about living with PTSD, it's those two types of conditions, um, that I just need to be conscious of. 

00:26:40
FRANK OCHBERG I... I like it. And to draw the analogy to other chronic conditions in medicine makes a lot of sense. 'Cuz, people can live with chronic hypertension, uh, you can live with conditions and you can mitigate them and you can prevent exacerbations. And some of these chronic conditions have very, very long remissions. 

00:27:05
MARLA HANDY I wake every morning engulfed in a familiar fog. I come to consciousness and am at several different ages at once. I am three, I am eight, I am 13. Those ages weren't happy times. Each contains a moment of horror that I sometimes relive through random flashbacks. My past is not a solid foundation upon which I stand to face each day. It's a surface of wavering, uneven layers, memories, and vulnerability that greets me each morning. I open my eyes and simultaneously sort through it all and make sure it's in order. Things may have moved, but they're all here. I made it through the night. I step on the shifting surface and find my balance anew. Again. 

00:28:00
[music] 

00:28:00
Are there particular places or situations that can trigger a stress reaction? 

00:28:00
MARLA HANDY I would be aware of it every morning. I mean, before I would wake up, I would be conscious of memories or tension of what I might be waking up into. There were no brand new days because every day would start with this tension and anxiety just of wakening. It shows up in, um, truly absurd ways. When I say absurd I, it's illogical and I understand that it's illogical in my current life. I describe in my book having this, um, reaction to ick. They're splatter. I've had, I have stories that ended up being traumatic for me when I was a kid. I see certain splatters and I, I get anxious because a number of my early traumas in my home happened in the kitchen. Uh, dishes clanking, uh, dishes dropping, the sound of silverware dropping on the floor, is having what is known as an exaggerated startle response and that can be everything from a.. to actually cowering and, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry," sort of thing, before I even know what's happened. Another example, it has to do with a, a perhaps a sense of claustrophobia. There's, um, clutter will often set me on edge. We've, um, come to call at my house now is, "the scary boxes in the hall." But it, there, I discovered that if there were boxes in the hallway I, my anxiety just spiked up. And It took me a while to figure out why, but it made me feel trapped, and it made me jump to, "I'm going to get raped again." So, it, truly, innocent items can create a reality for me that logically I know makes no sense. I just, they're, they're boxes. Um, but on an emotional level it still puts me on higher alert. 

00:30:25
FRANK OCHBERG See, I, I picture Marla as being like either the prisoner of the Gestapo or the kid in this very abusive home and, at that moment, there's such degradation, such stimulation of a part of the nervous system that has to do with disgust responses. And there's the fear response. And then there's, um, she's not a psychopath, she's got a conscience so she cares about being good. And something there in a perverse way gets stimulated. "I'm not good. I'm bad." And it isn't just, "I'm afraid of being bad because I'll be punished." She's already incorporated a sense of good and bad, so herself is telling herself, "You're bad." To come out of all of that, that's complex. That's not, that's not there in the survivor of the plane crash. And so we're... you know, we're getting at, thanks to Marla and thanks to her courage, honesty, and ability to articulate in a book, we're getting all of this put together. 

00:31:40
MARLA HANDY Everyone has memories of good and bad times and can voluntarily call up some of them, then set them aside again and live in the present. Some people dwell on the past out of choice or habit. They may relive their glory days or cultivate a past hurt. This may even get in the way of their current happiness. But this is not the same as having intrusive thoughts of traumatic events or re-experiencing them. Now, whatever you do, do not think about a pink elephant. So, what did you just picture? A pink elephant. You've had people do this with you before. I just planted an intrusive thought in your mind. Now imagine that pink elephant popping into your mind every five to ten seconds. Imagine coming to wakefulness in the morning, and in that split second before you open your eyes you see pink elephants and wonder if they're in the room. For me, the pink elephants are a part of life. 

00:32:35
[music] 

00:32:35
How does the past affect your present? 

00:32:35
MARLA HANDY I have a current life of, you know, with responsibilities and friends and emotions and activities and interests. And I also have my past life that I carry with me at the same time. I experience those as being two sides of a television screen, and the line between those two sides moves. So sometimes the past is just, oh, a sliver, and I live my life and I'm able to be productive and banter and have fun and I'm here. And sometimes it moves and crowds, the past crowds my present into a smaller and smaller space. And it is the feelings associated with this darkness that is sometimes very specific, which can be, which is what I think of in terms of triggers. I mean, it's something that is a smell or a sound or something that very specifically brings back something. Or, it may be something more general in terms of this sort of negativity, but there's an intensity of feeling associated with it that's not associated with what's happening right now. And so the experience is sort of living parallel lives. You know, one is this weight of the past that is still taking energy and the other is responding to and wanting to be a part of the present and, you know, and live a life. So,.. 

00:34:35
FRANK OCHBERG You know, I wrote this survivor psalm and it has the line in it, "I was a victim. I am a survivor." And I think a victim status is what you describe within that screen, that it's not only every element that's there in the past, it's that overall, in that past, you were a victim. And, and now you're not. But, but are you saying that still - even though most of the time you have friends, you have purpose, you're a survivor - that shadow is there? 

00:35:10
MARLA HANDY It's always there, and that's, that's my dilemma that I feel about the whole, the victim-survivor piece of it. 

00:35:20
FRANK OCHBERG It's not one or the other. 

00:35:20
MARLA HANDY It's not one or the other. I think that there is both, and I have, I have strong feelings about another component of it, too, is that if the trauma's caused by an individual.. 

00:35:30
FRANK OCHBERG (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. 

00:35:35
MARLA HANDY You know, if I am a victim, I have been victimized. 

00:35:35
FRANK OCHBERG (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. 

00:35:40
MARLA HANDY Its, there's another player there, and there's a social responsibility for acknowledging that, 

00:35:45
FRANK OCHBERG (crosstalk)Yes. 

00:35:45
MARLA HANDY and that that happens in the world. I have survived the events that brought me to these, this point, but they're not over. 

00:35:55
FRANK OCHBERG Yeah. And there's also the concept of, "Remember the Alamo, "Remember the Maine." Let's not forget. Uh, and to guard against forgetting for a lot of us is to preserve our heritage. I come from a Jewish background. We're not gonna' forget the Holocaust. And we don't want Ahmadinejad to forget, either. So, there are things that are important to remember. As painful as they are, it serves a purpose. I, if I were working with you as your doctor, 

00:36:30
MARLA HANDY (crosstalk)Yes. 

00:36:30
FRANK OCHBERG I might try to go there with you. To say, "Look, on that split screen, thank goodness you came out as beautifully, as wonderfully a person as you are." Uh, every once in a while, take me back there with you. Get that story told. No, it deserves to be told. And your father was a sadist. Maybe things drove him to it, but we have to prevent that kind of sadism in other dads who are gonna torture other kids. So.. 

00:37:05
MARLA HANDY You know, it wasn't right. I mean this is the thing, it wasn't, 

00:37:05
FRANK OCHBERG  (crosstalk)It wasn't right. No. 

00:37:10
MARLA HANDY And simply by saying that, you know, I'm a survivor... and the celebration of surviving doesn't equal the fact that it wasn't right and it's not that there's anything with my father in particular, but, you know, there, things are better. There is mandatory reporting in schools, 

00:37:25
FRANK OCHBERG (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:37:30
MARLA HANDY now. I mean, things have improved. But that doesn't mean that there as good as they can be, but we need to take social responsibility for that. 

00:37:40
FRANK OCHBERG Absolutely. And you didn't write your book to say, "Look. I'm fine." You know, your book ends with a lot of caution for yourself and for the reader, and I'm, I thank you for that. That's realistic. 

00:38:00
[music] 

00:38:00
What should I look for in a therapist? 

00:38:00
MARLA HANDY Look for someone who respects you and will treat you as a partner in discovering what's going on as opposed to an individual or a set of symptoms to be managed. Having gone through one of the two major episodes in my life that - as an adult - that were PTSD related, at the time defined as severe depression. In hindsight it's very clear to see, um, what the relationships were with that, and, uh, going to see a therapist and such, having sought out somebody, sitting down and, I was crying a lot at the time, and having these therapists ask me, I had said something about believing that my mother had a very hard life. And this therapist asked me, um, "Well, why do you think you cry when you say that?" And for the life of me I couldn't come up with an answer. I believe that I just, I just, I wasn't there. And her response to me was to say that, "You're clearly not invested in this process, so I think it's best that we not work together and that you not be my client," and she fired me as a client. I wasn't fitting her model of the invested client , and therefore she wasn't working with me. Compare that to some other experiences I've had where it's, "Come here, let's look at this." I mean, it's even, um, well, we'll figure this out. It's a partnership. And I'm considered the expert in my own experience as opposed to being, um, reframed as somehow being wrong, and I need to experience the world differently. 

00:40:10
FRANK OCHBERG When I heard about how that - I read about how that - therapist treated Marla, I got angry. I should have gotten sad, but I, I have to admit, I couldn't control my anger. Uh, I've been the mental health director of a large state, and there've been bad therapists that I had to discipline or fire, and I couldn't always purge the state of bad therapists, but to me that's bad therapy. That's, uh, that's interpreting somebody's inability to speak as non-cooperation with therapy. There are, unfortunately, there are therapists who aren't up to the trade and aren't up to the profession, and they're out there. And if you're a trauma patient and you run into somebody who isn't able to do the job, you've gotta' find somebody else. Maybe some of us, in the kind of position that I used to have, need to weed the department out from those therapists. And your therapist was a private practitioner, uh, I don't know how we teach her to do the right thing, but perhaps this way, when we write about her. We're not writing about her by name, but we're trying to put therapists on notice that there are better ways to treat somebody like you. But I think it's really the old-fashioned stuff that matters. There's a Rogerian approach where you're genuine, you have unconditional positive regard, you have empathy, and that's part of who you are as a therapist and I, I think this particular field is very exciting for, particularly, the mature therapist who has seen a lot, who understands grief and tragedy and who isn't afraid of it. 

00:42:00
MARLA HANDY That's a very helpful phrase in terms of, "who aren't afraid of it," because I think that my defining some of my stuff as my messiness, as stuff to be, to hide, because, um, it also made therapists uncomfortable. 

00:42:20
FRANK OCHBERG And you could pick that up, right? 

00:42:25
MARLA HANDY Yeah. And if they didn't have a quick, you know, response to that, or if I went through the, um, if I went through the re-parenting exercises and didn't feel like I was all better, well I wasn't gonna let anybody know that because I wanted to be a good client. So, um, and they, nobody wanted to know that wasn't working for me. 

00:42:50
FRANK OCHBERG (crosstalk)Right. 

00:42:55
MARLA HANDY So, I think there is that part in terms of the, um, the fear sometimes on the part of the therapist. There's, there's a, good therapy being affirming and working with my reality. Sometimes I think about people experiencing the world and looking at it from a bell curve, and that I happen to have had a number of experiences on one of the tails of the bell curve. And so my world view sort of comes from that part of the bell curve. Part of what I need is to know that there's a bigger world, and it fits in there . What I don't need is to say, "That doesn't happen." "That's not right." That, "No, you need to look at things from, you know, the center of the bell curve," or, better yet, from, "If you just think positively, everything will be fine." Um, so there's that both/and in the same way that I'm working at, you know, I think my struggle in life is figuring out how to do both/and. So, it's a thinking about this as both/and, and having a, uh, um, a therapist who can also acknowledge that, yes, what I experienced is in fact reality. And it needs to be balanced, perhaps, with some other things, but that does not discount my own experience. 

00:44:25
FRANK OCHBERG That makes so much sense to me. 

00:44:30
[music] 

00:44:30
How can others support the person with PTSD? 

00:44:30
MARLA HANDY I have been fortunate enough to have, um, wonderful friends who were able to be supportive of me when [00:44:55} neither us, of us knew what was going on. And, I'm saying this in terms of my experience of having had a flashback and, in front of a friend, um, and huddled and going away and, just the acceptance . And she sat there and she rubbed my leg and just to do this while I went through this. So, from one extreme there , I mean it, it's that too, certainly my husband is, has been able to be very supportive of, um, sometimes even recognizing before I do when my anxiety level, when I'm starting to be a little more on edge, and um, you know, and sometimes I can tell because, uh, he'll clean clutter up that I wouldn't necessarily paid any.. Like I come in.. 

00:45:55
FRANK OCHBERG (crosstalk)He's well-trained. 

00:45:55
MARLA HANDY I think that the other part of this that - and I joked with him about that - is being able to have some humor in it. And I.. Humor's incredibly important to me. I mean, it's from having the, uh, the sense to, um, not treat me like this fragile being, but to be able to say, "Yeah, we have these scary boxes in the hall." To acknowledge that that's part of my life and just get on with it. I mean, to be supportive, but they don't scan the environment, they're not necessarily keeping me in a bubble, but just.. 

00:46:40
FRANK OCHBERG Sure. I wanna' add something. There are people who come form toxic families, and they shouldn't go home again. Sometimes I find that I can use the authority that I have as a physician to say, "You don't have to go home for the holidays." They really don't want to, but they feel obligated, and they feel there'll be someone in the family who'll lay a trip on them for not doing what's expected. 

00:47:15
MARLA HANDY For not following the rules. 

00:47:15
FRANK OCHBERG That's right. And these.. And these are the rules that were used to degrade, to traumatize, to abuse; it's all part of that. 

00:47:25
MARLA HANDY (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:47:30
FRANK OCHBERG And, and you don't have to go back. Did you learn that? 

00:47:30
MARLA HANDY Oh, yeah. And, and the, the ironic part of - 'cause I learned this early and, I'd say in my 20s, actually. The irony for me is that I learned that I actually had more power in my family than I realized by just not, I mean, "No, I'm not going back. I'm not doing this. I'm not, um, If you continue to speak with me that way, I am not staying here tonight. I'm not.." And, and then not doing it. 

00:48:00
FRANK OCHBERG And some of them are are in denial about the perpetration that went on in the family, and they're gonna stick to their denial, that's they're coping mechanism. You write books. That's a different coping mechanism. And it's better. 

00:48:15
MARLA HANDY Yeah. Well, and they, you know, they have their own stories, 

00:48:20
FRANK OCHBERG (crosstalk)Yes. Yes. 

00:48:20
MARLA HANDY and their own paths. So, um, but that, just because a family member has their own path doesn't mean I have to lay myself down in front of them so they run me over. 

00:48:30
FRANK OCHBERG Exactly. 

00:48:30
MARLA HANDY Those who have accepted the facts of my life often find me admirable for surviving, even thriving, in spite of it all. You might think I would find that comforting, but I never have. It creates or emphasizes the distance between us. They see triumphs over past obstacles, whereas I experience, the continuing vulnerability of walking a tightrope . There is no point of completion, no sigh of relief, no victory dance in the end zone. 

00:49:00
[music] 

00:49:00
Closing Thoughts 

00:49:00
FRANK OCHBERG Let's assume there are two kinds of people who are watching and listening to us now. One are the healers or, whether they're professional healers or they're friends who wanna help someone heal, and the other are those who can identify with Marla. They've gone through what she's gone through and they want better for themselves. Let me address that group first. Try to guard against saying, "Oh, but Marla, you ended up getting married; it's all that," or, "Oh, Marla, you ended up getting a degree; it's all that." Don't think of what Marla has that you don't have, think of what Marla had to contend with that you have to contend with. And there are a lotta tools here, and there's a very hopeful and affirming message. And look, Marla's life is not a rose garden right now, either. She has a split screen. The past is very much with her. She's managed to learn how to live in a present and to be proud of herself. . Uh, she has a purpose to her life. So, do your best to identify with what you can pick up from Marla and if you catch yourself saying, "No, I can't do that," or "No, she's lucky and I'm unlucky," you're not helping yourself. And for those of us who are healers, this is a partnership and I encourage healers to be partners with their clients and their patients and to keep learning. And if you can learn how to deal with these issues, you're really at the advanced edge of post-traumatic therapy. 

00:50:50
MARLA HANDY I believe that the lack of comfort, the no comfort zone, the sense of isolation that people with PTSD feel is not generated solely by those who have PTSD. It is also generated by broader society who would really rather not know some of the things that we know. And I would like to have people become, on both sides of what I've referred to as the looking glass. Getting PTSD is being pushed through the looking glass, and I would like people on both sides of the looking glass to realize that there are steps to take to reduce that sense of isolation. And some of the steps on the part of those who do not have PTSD may mean stepping out of their comfort zone. 

00:51:45
FRANK OCHBERG And I'd like to add I made a mistake when I said two kinds of people are gonna' read this book, those who identify as, who identify with Marla and those who, who are the healers and helpers. There's a third group who are neither, and that third group is neither of those. And it includes those people who don't understand this topic and who may actually make matters worse through their behavior. And if we can reach that group, that's a huge advance.

Survivor Psalm I have been victimized. I was in a fight that was not a fair fight. I did not ask for the fight. I lost. There is no shame in losing such fights. I have reached the stage of survivor and am no longer a slave to victim status. I look back with sadness rather than hate. I look forward with hope rather than despair. I may never forget, but I need not constantly remember. I was a victim. I am a survivor.
