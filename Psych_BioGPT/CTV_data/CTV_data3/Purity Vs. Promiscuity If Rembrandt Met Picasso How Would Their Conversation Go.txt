Purity vs. Promiscuity: If Rembrandt met Picasso How Would Their Conversation Go? With Sheila McNamee, Ph.D.

00:00:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE Thank you Bryer (ph). Thank you Julie. Uh, and good morning everyone. Um, it's really delightful to be here. We've been, Bryer and Julie and I have been in conversation for quite a while about organizing this and, um, I don't think I've ever been in more capable hands in terms of people taking care of every little detail and taking care of me and so, um, it's really lovely to be here and if they'll have me back, I'm saying I'll already come back, okay? So, um, what I want to do this morning is something that I have only done once before in my life and that is I wanna read what I want to say simply because I wrote this to be read and I worked, I finetuned it in a way that if I do what I always do, which is free wheel, and then I get off on a tangent and then I go somewhere else and somewhere else, um, so I really wanna stick to this and I'm sure I'll, um, integrate some tangents into this, undoubtedly, but, um, I hope it's, uh, what I refer to as a dynamic reading instead of a stale, boring academic reading. Why the topic of purity and promiscuity? Why Rembrandt and Picasso? What do these topics have to do with the practice of family therapy or the evolution of family therapy theory? I think these topics can help us focus on building inclusiveness in theory and practice. When I speak of inclusion, I'm speaking from the stance of social construction, where the coordination of multiple voices, multiple modes of practice, and multiple world views is celebrated. I would like to propose some clarity about therapy as a process of social construction and in so doing, invite the multiple voices of family therapy into the conversation as well as into our practice. Let me begin by speaking directly to the terms and names that appear in my title. Promiscuity, purity, Rembrandt, and Picasso. I didn't use promiscuity because I thought it would capture your attention for lascivious reasons, okay? Um, although if it did, that's fine too. Is there an element that unites these and connects with the themes, the theme of building inclusiveness within the theory and practice of family therapy? My hope is that there is. The term promiscuous is derived from the French word mousier (ph), which means to mix up. Thinking of this term in relation to the field of family therapy, I am immediately reminded of John Franko Jaquin's (ph) notion of irreverence and the more general evolutionary, revolutionary spirit of the field as captured in Lynn Hoffman's (ph) book, Family Therapy: An Intimate History. If you haven't read that, I think it, she takes you through her, her life with great, the great family therapist that, um, we've all learned from and it's a beautiful story. Promiscuity suggests the interface of the old and the new, the use of familiar forms of action in new ways. Promiscuity might well be described as intellectual poaching to the extent that we might employ, in new ways, accepted ideas and techniques, borrowing them from their original context. So we might use something that was meant to be used this way in an entirely different way. Purity, on the other hand, refers to a state of being that is unmixed. There's a sense of consistency when we think of purity. There's also a sense of remaining true to an original form. In this respect, purity might be related to the authorship of a theory and those of us practicing within that theoretical model attempt to do so with respect for its authorship. We could draw a parallel to classical practices of music production, where remaining close or true to the composer's interpretation is valued. This practice, of course, is contrasted to contemporary forms of music production, where sampling allows one to mix a wide variety of artists, styles and formats. Sampling, then, stands as an illustration of the promiscuous stance described above. In therapy, identifying as a structural therapist, for example, has specified, has specific, um, indications for your practice. You're recognized as operating with a clearly defined model and you are pure but not promiscuous when you do that. Clearly these terms sit in opposition of each other. If we were to embody this opposition in the form of art, we might look at the distinctions between Rembrandt and Picasso's artistic styles. Rembrandt is noted for his ability to make images in his paintings look lifelike. For example, in the famous painting, I hope some of you can conjure this up. I should have brought images. The Feast of Belshazzar. The gold and the Jews, jewels are rendered as real. Similarly, in his other famous painting, The Syndics of the Draper's Guild, is also a painting recognized as achieving an appearance of the real and the natural. This ability to render objects as real can be associated with purity. There appears to be no confusion between art and life. In contrast, Picasso's work is better described as abstract, not picturing reality as it is. It mixes art and life, objects and shapes, colors and other things in ways that are novel. Where Rembrandt's art is described as mirroring reality, Picasso is seen as a form of reality distortion. Gregory Bateson (ph), one of my favorite people, captures the promiscuity of Piscasso's style. He says, somebody was saying to Picasso that he ought to make pictures the thing, of things the way they are, objective pictures. He mumbled he wasn't quite sure what that would be. The person who was bullying him produced a photograph of his wife from his wallet and said there, you see? That is a picture of how she really is. Picasso looked at it and said she's rather small isn't she? And flat. On another occasion, when addressing a complaint that his portrait of Gertrude Stein did not look like her, Picasso replied never mind it will. I imagine the conversation that Rembrandt and Picasso might have about their different interpretations of the world as similar to these two interchanges of Picasso's and I wonder how these differences between real, that is objective and pure, and created, that is not authentic because of its mixed nature, it's promiscuity, can be generative in our own practice as family therapists. Is it possible, I wondered, to coordinate purity and promiscuity in the practice of family therapy? How might we move beyond the conflicted, excuse me, between, beyond the conflict presented by these two incommensurate modes? In therapy as in art, we move between those who know how things really are and those who are interested in participating in the unfolding process of how things might become. It's in this vein that I would like to talk about transformative dialog, specifically how do we move beyond incompatibility and find generative ways of working between, among, and within various models of family therapy? It is within the theme of transformative dialog that I find a useful elaboration of social construction of discourse. Thus my ideas about transformative dialog provide me with the opportunity to clarify what I call social construction and how I see social construction in relation to conclusiveness in therapeutic theory and practice. Let me begin by talking about social construction as a philosophical stance, rather than as a model or a method for therapy. You might note that the book that Ken Gurgin (ph) and I edited in 1992, we called Therapy as Social Construction intentionally and intentionally avoided the, the title Social Constructionist Therapy as if it were a new brand of therapy. So this is not a model, it's a philosophical stance. Social construction offers us a stance for engaging in the therapeutic relationship. When we talk about therapy as social construction, we are not emphasizing a particular technique or method, but rather a way of talking about therapeutic process. Therapy as social construction is a conversational process. Perhaps the most useful way to talk about the relationship between contructionism and therapy is to recognize that there are no constructionist therapies per se. Rather, constructionism as a philosophical stance positions us to view therapeutic process as a conversation or a dialog. Building on this theme, we can explore how different theories and models of family therapy might be seen as entries into the conversation rather than viewed as the answer to therapeutic practice. This is distinguishable from other stances toward therapy in a significant way. Looking at the field of family therapy over the past several decades, we can list numerous models and I know I will omit them here. Structural, systemic, collaborative language system, symbolic experientials, solution focused, narrative, and many others. Each of these conversations, I'm now talking about these models as conversations or as discourses, ways of being in the world, prescribes what is to be viewed as central, which in turn determines what we should look for, what questions we should ask, what ways we should talk about families, and so forth. The therapeutic conversation is open yet closed. Open to various discoveries or constructions and yet closed to others because of the kinds of questions we're supposed to ask and the kinds of ways we're supposed to look at the family from within that model. Let's look at an illustration. If I follow Minutian's (ph) Structural Model, I'm exploring boundaries, hierarchies, coalitions, etc. My conversation is indeterminable, yet contained. If, on the other hand, I'm trained to use the Solution Focused Approach, I inquire into moments that are problem free. My attempt would be to provide space for conversations focused on moments when the problem was not present, thereby giving less credibility to the power of the problem itself. The structural and solution focused therapists speak different languages and, when confronted with one another, it is as if two incommensurate communities were attempting to figure out who's got it right. Since both structural and solution focused therapy offer generative resources for family transformation, our challenge, an important challenge to me, is to coordinate these resources and the multiple other resourceful models to enhance our therapeutic work. It's not about which one is right and which is wrong but the question is is such coordination possible? I believe it is if we allow ourselves to be promiscuous. If we are a bit more promiscuous, that is, if we mix things up a bit, might we then begin to see each model and theory of family therapy as a potentially useful way to construct a future together with our clients? To me, this is what we are talking about when we talk about therapy as social construction. It is a process of constructing a viable reality with our clients and that viable reality cannot possibly come pre-packaged, ready to, for use, for all clients in all situations, because we can never know ahead of time what resources, what values, what stories our clients bring to the therapeutic conversation. Constructing a way of being in the world, a way of talking, acting and interpreting involves the coordination of participants, all participants. This is the case for both our therapeutic conversations with our clients where we create a local way of being together, that is a local reality, and together with each other as colleagues developing theories and models of practice. As any community coordinates its activities, it generates over time standards and expectations. If you look in the handouts, there's, um, I think the second page, the third page if, counting, yeah, that one, with the cycle is a depiction of what I want. This is, this is my cheat sheet on, if you want to understand social construction, only if it works for you. If it doesn't work for you, don't bother with it but I feel, you know, people try to wrap their head around what social construction is. It is many things to many people and, um, this is a very particular, what I would call radically relational view of social construction and the idea here is that, um, people come together and coordinate their activities together. Let me step aside from my text here and just, uh, try to say it very clearly in the sense of one of the unique things about being human is how quickly we coordinate our activities together. Okay? As a couple of examples, if you look, how many of you have ever driven in Mexico City? That's why you're all here and alive, okay. Uh, the, the traffic in Mexico City, you've probably heard, is outrageous. It's packed. There are people like cutting this way and cutting that way but it moves. It moves and it, at some level if you can, like, you know, get into your zen space and not get frustrated by, you know, not being able to get to where you need to be in time, you, you can really appreciate this perfect coordination. It's like dance, okay? Another illustration I often think of is if you had a helicopter view of Manhattan at rush hour. There's people walking on the street. Now many of us have been in the midst of really busy innercity streets and we know. You know, you're dodging people but you do and it, again, it's like this beautiful choreography. So something about the way we are, we coordinate and there's no value. I'm not placing a value on coordination that, you know, when we like, it's coordinated and when we don't like it, it's not coordinated. I'm simply saying that we find some kind of pattern. So from our coordination, very quickly patterns do emerge and rituals. All right? The example I've always used is my students in seminar. You know, the first day of the semester, they come in and they sit at, around this big, long seminar table, 20 people. And then I come in and we start class. Second time we meet, I come, walk into the room and they're all in exactly the same spot. Okay? Third time, same spot. So it doesn't take long before a ritual, a pattern emerges. You know, you bring flowers to someone that you wanna have, you know, you're going on a date with, first time, the second time, the third time they say where are my flowers? So, so you have, so, but from those, so from our coordinations, we have these patterns and rituals emerge, which generate standards and expectations. So with my students, the fourth class, someone who wants to add to the class but hasn't been there yet comes early and sits there and then that person comes in. Hey, that's my seat. You know, so we, we develop all of the sudden. It doesn't take long before this is the way things are, this is the way things do, we do things here. Okay? And from that, whole world views, whole belief systems, whole value systems emerge, okay? And then those belief and value systems feed into our future coordination. Okay? So that's a, like, quick and dirty description of social construction, that we are constantly engaging in that and because we engage in so many coordinated activities with so many people, we have multiple realities. We, we don't just have one, we have multiple ourselves. We hold incommensurate views all the time. So we'll talk more about that later as the, the morning goes on, but, um, okay. So ultimately over time a tradition is established, a reality constructed. To talk one way is to participate in culturally embedded practices of interpretation. In the current illustration, models, or theories, our accomplishments borne out of communal practices. In other words, we accomplish them. We make them. However, without curiosity and reflection, such coordinated activity can invite purity. Habit creates competency traps. That's a line that jazz musicians use all the time. You don't want, you know, if you're doing improvisation, you do not want to improv the same solo when it's your turn. That's not improv, okay? So once we feel, you know, we're competent at something, then it, it's a habit and it become, it's a trap. You know? So we wanna constantly keep ourselves on the edge. That's why I like the boundaries. Like trying to self, give myself self medication for that. Um, okay, let's explore some of the negative byproducts of the tendency toward purity that we all have. Okay, one is that we prioritize one model over another regardless of the ability of the therapist to coordinate with the client. The therapist could be seen as focused on his or her own goals, rights, or needs where focus is on how well he or she exemplifies use of this model. Okay? So in other words, you know, for being true to the model and it's not working, it's usually the client's fault if we really believe the model is the right thing and I'm just concerned about how confident I'm gonna look as a therapist using the right techniques. Okay, with purity, there's a generation of a sense of basic isolation or independence among and between forms of practice, theoretical models, schools of thought. You know, you're not with us, so we can't talk to you. I don't wanna get into that conversation. This isolation generates constant questioning of one's professional standing either in the sense of wondering if one makes the mark or in the sense of impressing others who don't make our mark. Thus it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to talk across models and with no possibility of, to connect, we retreat to our private practice. Little pun there. Um, finally, we might easily find ourselves locked into unending conflict with our colleagues over our incommensurate moralities and ideological commitments where our clients get caught in the middle of our professional battles. We have to ask is this useful? Social construction, by focusing on performance, that is what we do and how our, what we are doing together and what are doing creates, what values, what beliefs, what's mean, what meanings, what sense of community is made that shifts our attention from purity to promiscuity. The metaphor of performance implies attention to improvisation which requires continual coordination with others. Coordination implies that some form of other is always omnipresent and thus we are always relationally oriented. If we operate within a construction of stance, we are likely to generate the sort of promiscuity that invites inclusiveness among theories and practices of family therapy. How do we engage with each other, with each others models and with our clients, if we insist on speaking only one language? If we only follow one model, we might limit the possibilities for personal, social, and communal change. Our attempts at purity might not only alienate us from each other, but also from our clients. If we continue to argue for theoretical and methodological purity, we slowly narrow the professional spaces within which we can move and perhaps more important is the way in which our attempts at purity begin to craft forms of oppression, pathology, and deficit in the culture at large. We begin, for example, to believe that the miracle question is the only way to move beyond personal difficulty, that the focus on the problem is always the problem, and we should instead consistently and with rigor attend to solutions. Our purity, while a beautiful elaboration of skill, competence and sometimes even art, becomes the limit of our world. Yet purity generates dichotomies. For example, focus on the problem ignores what works. Focus on what works ignores what can be learned from examining the way we talk about problems. To say something is good implies a standard within a tradition. In sum, our theoretical differences generate conflict and when we confront conflict, we tend to avoid other models, simplify them, explain them in negative terms. When we do these things, we unwittingly engage in practices of stigmatization, where the implicit value system of each model is embraced with purity, thereby demonizing all other models and their implied systems of value. Because of the valuational component, out attempts at purity are never neutral. They do not merely describe another model or method. They emerge as a moral judgment. It communicates deficit. You're not concerned with issues of gender. You're too concerned with issues of gender. You should never engage in problem talk. You should always engage in problem talk. It's impossible to know the pattern. Knowing the pattern is impossible. Oh, it's important to know the pattern. Knowing the pattern is impossible. We can only know how people talk about the pattern. Okay? There's little way to escape this sort of stigmatizing the process. Purity also invites us into the discourse of blame. We critique each other's therapy. Your model leads you to be oppressive. You're maintaining the problem. You're ignoring the problem. This of course invites others into a posture of counter blame. Each moves into a mode of self-defense. In defending one's own practice, we quickly find, one quickly finds oneself in heated debate. Debate dominates over alternatives for competing models can co-exist. Purity also invites us to disrupt communities and their associated practices. Rather than see a form of practice as innovation and innovative within it's own terms or within a particular community, we try to obliterate it because it's outdated or because it's gender, race, or economically blind. Can't we ask instead what part of the narrative model, of solution focused therapy, or of cybernetics is useful rather than implying inferiority of other traditions? Related, purity can also support the deterioration of relationships. Professional purity disrupts the processes of relational engagement that might otherwise take place in the community. Rather than debate the merits of one model over another, can we engage in dialogs that knit us together by virtue of a focus on innovation or strengths or success? Finally, purity invites a form of professional disempowerment. By remaining true to one form, to one way of talking, to one set of assumptions, we blind ourselves to alternatives. Purity in this way offers no innovative resources when the old wears thin. Thus we can see that our challenge is not to create purity, a world where we all agree on what model to use and just a footnote here, we never would be able to do that anyway, but rather to ask how promiscuity can assist us in moving beyond theoretical and practical unity. After all, don't we want the most abundant resources at our disposal to be the professionals we aspire to become? The question then becomes one of crafting ways to go on together as Vitkinstein (ph) would say. Social construction offers the promiscuous stance we might find useful. For the constructionist, language practices are the focus of our concern. It is in language that we create the worlds in which we live and by language I mean all embodied activity. I don't mean just words, spoken or read. I don't mean just verbal, non-verbal. I mean in body, all embodied activity. We can talk more about that this morning. Thus it should come as no surprise that in talking about therapy theory and models, we are focused on the discourse of all models and how particular discursive moves can strain or potentate different forms of action and consequently prohibit or enable different reality constructions. This is a liberating stance because it generates curiosity. When we become curious as opposed to judgmental about how people engage with, with each other, we open ourselves to the consideration of alternatives. This particular feature is often associated with the constructionist's focus on uncertainty, attention to language, all embodied activities, positions us in a reflexive relationship to our own actions as well as the actions of others. We are poised and prepared to ask what other ways might I invite this client into creating a story of transformation? How is she inviting me into a legitimating or transforming or challenging her story? What other voices might I use now? What other voices might he use, etc.? Each model of family therapy becomes another voice. I find it useful to be attentive to how might focus on our engagement with other models. Social construction is not a technique and it is not more pure, just a pure philosophical stance. Rather, it is an orientation that privileges what is happening in the conversation. In the present case, the conversation among and in between different models of family therapy. Can we call constructionism promiscuous? The focus is on dialog, how we bridge incommensurate models, that is belief systems, realities, not on merging different models into on meta-narrative. This is a significant difference because it positions the therapist in an open manner to any method or theory or therapy. Narrative, solution focused, even cognitive, behavioral or psychoanalytic therapy all become potentially viable and generative ways of relationally engaging with each other as well as with our clients. The challenge is to see a model, technique, or even a theory as a discursive option. This is what constructionism invites us to do and to that extent, I think constructionism can be call promiscuous. Any particular discourse or, in this case, any particular theory or model becomes a potential resource for transformation rather than a tool that will bring about, read cause, transformation. Promiscuity as a stance tunes us into the interactive moment where therapeutic change might be possible. The challenge, of course, is that there are no specific, specific techniques, nor are there any desires to determine which ways of talking are therapeutic and which are not. The question of what is therapeutic remains open and indeterminate, just like conversation. When therapy is understood as a conversational process, we can never be certain where it will go. I can never fully predict another's next move and consequently the potential for moving in new directions, generating new conclusions and possibilities as well as constraints, is ever present. What we can do, however, is remain attentive to what conversational resources we select and which ones might serve as useful alternatives. This stance of promiscuity has implications for therapeutic practice. Selecting a theory or technique as a practical option as opposed to a truthful option or the right option for action enhances our ability to be relationally engaged with our clients. We become sensitive to their stories as well as our own stories in ways that allow us to be responsive and relationally responsible. There are many ways in which we might pragmatically achieve such a responsivity. I'd like to identify two conversational themes that could encourage the sort of promiscuity I'm proposing here. Let's take a brief look at these themes and consider how each might be useful in approaching therapeutic process as a conversational activity and thus constructing the potential for a range of therapeutic practices. First I refer to as using the familiar in unfamiliar places and I, I put it this way because for years I've been struck by how often in context, whether it's therapeutic or any other helping context, someone presents a problem. We often move right into a mode of feeling that we need to teach them to do something different. Okay? And I just have a very strong notion that we don't need to teach anybody to do anything different. We just need to help people use the resources, the infinite array of resources that they have, that we all have, in different ways. So to use something that's familiar in one domain in a new unfamiliar domain. Okay? Using the familiar in unfamiliar places. Tom Anderson talks about introducing not too much change and not too little change, but just enough change. He echoes Batson's (ph) well-known phrase, the difference that makes a difference. Here, when I talk about, of using familiar resources in unfamiliar domains, I'm suggesting a variation on this common theme. We all carry with us many voices, many differing opinions, views, and attitudes, even on the same subject. These voices represent the accumulation of our relationships, actual, imagined, and virtual. In effect, we carry the residue of many others with us. We contain multitudes yet most of our actions, along with the positions we adopt in our practice of therapy are one dimensional. They represent only a small segment of all that we might do and say. The challenge is to draw on these other voices, these conversational resources that are familiar in one set of relationships and situations but not in another. In doing so, excuse me, we achieve just enough difference as Tom Anderson proposes. Using familiar resource, unfamiliar resources in context where we generally use our familiar or pet model invites us into new forms of relational engagement with others. If we think of all of our activities as invitations into different relational constructions, then we can focus on how utilizing particular resources invites certain responses or constructions in specific relationships and how it invites different responses and different constructions in others. Let me elaborate by focusing attention for the moment on the issue of professional identity. We inherit from our tradition the expectation that there's a proper way to be a professional therapist. Guess what? There isn't. Um, we often see it in trainees when they begin seeing clients. They're more likely to talk as they believe a therapist should talk, thereby ignoring those conventional resources that are familiar specific to them. Okay, they give up all of their way of being with people to become the therapist now. The familiar becomes alienated. Their usual way of talking with people. I've lost my, oh, and what has previously been alienated, that is the identity of, as a therapist is miraculously supposed to be familiar. This reminds me of my own clinical training. As a researcher of therapeutic process, I spent years interviewing families, couples, and individuals about therapy. After many years as a researcher, I decided to take the plunge and train to become a therapist. When I finally initiated my training, I found myself almost speechless with clients. Not only did I have a hard time thinking of questions to ask, regardless of how much pre-session time we had in generating potential questions, etc., but I was constantly monitoring myself for how I asked the question. I wondered endlessly about whether or not everything I did or said was right, given my new role as therapist. Were my questions circular enough? You know, etc., etc. One day while sitting with a client, my supervisors called me out of the room. Oh, I'll tell this story in full later today because it's quite funny. Um, they asked one very simple question. Let me just preface and say I was dying in the room, okay? Um, they asked one very simple question. Are you comfortable and confident when you interview people for your research? My response was affirmative. They said then go back in there and act like a researcher. This directed, or directive was so liberating for me that I forgot my fear of acting like a therapist and engaged in simple conversation with the client. What I realized in this moment was how our attempts to be good professional actually can prohibit our ability to be relationally responsive as professionals in our conversations with clients. I also realized the benefit of using a familiar repertoire in a context where I would not expect it to serve as an appropriate resource. If we can encourage ourselves and others to draw broadly on the conversational resources that are already familiar, perhaps we can act in ways that are just different enough to invite others into something other than the same old unwanted pattern. This idea I believe is distinct from what we expect of ourselves as therapists. We expect, and our clients expect, us to converse within a limited and pre-legitimized range of topics and terms. That range is in, is dictated by the theory within which we practice. Thus for the behavioral therapist, all conversation is drawn from the realm of learned patterns of behavior and associated concepts. The novelty in using theory or models as forms of discourse is not, is that doing so allows us to engage in a responsive way with our clients. We are free to abandon the need to persuade our clients that knowledge of their problems is not only authoritative, but correct. Instead, we can engage with our clients in collaboratively constructing, even if our part of the collaboration is from the achieved stance of authority, alternative ways to talk and act about and within their life circumstances. The second piece, beyond that, the second, uh, feature I wanted to talk about that I think is practical is what I call a focus on the future. In an attempt to enhance promiscuity, we can embrace, the question is can we embrace fantasy, the unknown, and the uncertain, uncertainty of the future. I do not mean to suggest here, however, abandoning our interest in the past. Instead I would like to propose that when we embrace a both end stance and in the current moment place our attention more pointedly though, just for this moment, on the future. If we examine the field of therapy, we can note that a good deal of therapy talk hovers on the past. Therapists and clients alike explore the history and evolution of the problems that clients bring to therapy. When did the problem begin? How long has it been a difficulty? How have you come to understand the problem? What do you think caused the problem? What do others say about it and you? What have you done to try and solve the problem? The questions that therapists ask direct the therapeutic, uh, conversation toward the past, as do the expectations of many clients. They bring this expectation that they'll be talking about the past. Most cultural presentations of therapy, just consider any Woody Allen film for example, portray client and therapists locked in a conversation about the past. Childhood, adolescence, former failed marriages, everything. Okay. With such an emphasis on these past oriented questions, there's little room for imagining the future. The potential to sediment the past, to reitify (ph) that story and therefy make, or make it static and immutable is tremendous. Probably more important is the logic inherent in the therapeutic focus on the past. Just think about this. By focusing on what has already transpired, we unwittingly give credibility to causal models that are the hallmark of modern science. We privilege the logic that claims that what went before causes what follows, what's happening now is gonna cause what happens in the future. That's a nice lineal progression that we take from modern science. As a constructionist, I do not necessarily want to argue for disconnection with the past, present, and future and all of their relations. I simply want to raise the issue of narration. The past is always a story and we all know that there are many ways to tell a story. Not only do we harbor many voices, each with a different set of possible narrations, but others involved in the same history will very likely narrate it differently as well. Thus the causality of past to present and implied future will take different turns, highlight different features, and pathologize varied aspects, depending on which story is privileged. One reason that future oriented discourse enhances promiscuity is because we all understand that we do not yet know the future. We've not embodied it yet and thus to the extent that we engage with others in conversation about the future, we underscore the relational construction of our worlds. We invite people into a moment of construction. We fabricate together what we might live into. We liberate ourselves to mix things up, to be promiscuous. This is not to suggest that talk of the past is emblematic of bad therapy. I'm not arguing for solution focused therapy over psychoanalytic therapy, for example. Instead of privileging a particular way to talk and/or particular themes or topics for therapy, constructionism emphasizes the collaborative situated creation of possibilities and one way to achieve this is with future oriented discourse. The question I urge us to engage is how as therapists we might imagine mixing things up. Let me review what I see is the specific issues promiscuity raises for therapeutic practice. First, mixing theories presents a challenge to traditional notions of expert knowledge and professional neutrality. It is not the case that constructionists do not recognize expertise or authority. What constructionists call into question is the unquestioned presumption that the therapist should be the authority and that it's only in the therapist's position as authority or expert in one model that therapeutic success can be accomplished. I would like to suggest that the task at hand is one of coordination among models. Recall earlier my emphasis on bridging as opposed to an emphasis on making incommensurate discourses commensurate. We don't want to try to make, you know, find the perfect overall model or theory. What we want to do is almost like juggle, keep them all in coordinated activity with each other. I'd like to suggest that the task on, on hand is one of coordination among models and coordination could likely include a wide array of possibilities. It could include, for example, problem talk, diagnosis, and an authoritative stance taken by the therapist. There's nothing wrong with any of those things in the right moment. It is also likely that it might require the therapist to adopt the stance of a conversational partner who does not know with certainty how to understand or make sense of the client's problem. Furthermore, it might involve conversation about possibilities, potentials, and ideals. The point is, from a constructionist stance, we can not know ahead of time what will be the most generative therapeutic practice for any given client. Second, constructionism raises the question of focus in the therapeutic conversation. Traditional therapy focuses on the past to understand the present. Therapy informed by a constructionist sensibility places focus on the interactive moment, the now, the here, the past, present, and future as they are narrated in this moment. To that end, rather than attempt to provide clients with new resources for action, therapy attempts to help clients utilize the conversational resources they already have in new and unusual conversational arenas. Additionally, the therapeutic conversation might focus on the future as well as on the discourse of the ideal. Finally, there's a difference between ignoring the past as it is narrated and valuing participant's understandings of the past as coherent, rational and legitimate. With constructionists arguing for attention to the interactive moment, a good deal of confusion has emerged, I think, over how a therapist can honor the client's desire or lack of desire to focus on the past. Talk about the past is always in the present. The rationale for talking about the past is not for the constructionist to dig into the causes of the client's problem. The past need only be discussed in as much as the client finds relevance in telling his or her history and one, when this does in fact have relevance for the client, the therapist who sees therapy as a process of social construction can explore how to move on from a value of the past, a respect for that past, to the creation of a generative future. In the face of competing models and methods, the tendency to slip into that sinking sense of uncertainty is heightened. The structured expectations of therapy that have emerged as a result of scientific discourse symbolized here by purity, has increased the possibility of adopting a self-deprecating uncertainty, something like systemic therapy isn't rigorous enough. You know, particularly when we confront evidence based, uh, practice, uh, all the groans, right? Alternatively, the uncertainty that is associated with constructionism is one that invites multiplicity and thereby invites therapists and clients alike to question their assumptions and explore alternative resources for personal, relational, and social transformation. Uncertainty invites promiscuity. We could call this generative uncertainty. So instead of that self-deprecating uncertainty, oh, am I doing, am I following this model correctly, we have this kind of uncertainty like hmm, what other ways could I do this? Generative uncertainty encourages us to be responsive to the interactive moment. The therapist is now a conversational partner who is free to move within the relationship in ways that enhance both therapist's and client's ability to draw on a wide range of conversational resources. The therapist is not burdened with being right, but with being present and responsive. The therapist and, and client become accountable to each other, yet accountability, presence and responsivity to each other is not enough. Our conversations in the therapeutic context might be more usefully centered on broader community transformation. How might we, as therapists, invite clients into the sorts of relationships that effectively transform our ways of living communally? To this end, constructionism would suggest that our understanding of the term therapeutic practice expand well beyond the therapist/client relationship. My comments here raise several important issues, issues that must be addressed within the profession. These include questions of evaluation, ethics, expertise, and training. Though is it appropriate, we might ask, to employ abstract standards? Obviously such a move would require a complete rethinking of how we engage in evaluation and, more important, what evaluation means. Whose standards are being used? To what purposes? Who's left out? These are dramatically important questions, as you all know. Training, in addition, requires serious reflection. Can we only be promiscuous after we have been fully trained within one theoretical model? Does promiscuity require initial dedication to the study and practice of a particular model? Can we only become promiscuous once we've worked with a number of different models and different clients and different contexts? Okay, how do we create training programs that build a freedom to mix things up into the very fiber of the trainee's experiences? These are very difficult questions with no one answer, obviously. If we draw on the idea of promiscuity itself, we might recognize that there's no singular way to prepare one to become a therapist, as there is no singular method for evaluation. Perhaps promiscuity as a metaphor reminds us not only to mix things up but to recognize risk in the very simple practices with which we engage. The risk to question what standards and what practices are being used to evaluate the success of therapy as well as the risk to question what will count as a generative training program emerge from this stance of promiscuity. I invite us all to be promiscuous, to rekindle the revolutionary spirit of family therapy in an attempt to build inclusiveness in theory practice. Thanks.
