ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in its normal(ph) recovery, right now. Those who spend time daily to harness clam do the best in their recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is Rewriting the Ending. This exercise is very helpful for those caught in a cycle of imagining the worst, when actually they are in a safe place. One client told me that he pictured being in back in a dangerous military incident, when he heard police sirens and saw cars race by him. He was startled and shaken up in the moment. We works on an exercise to help reframe and then retrain this automatic response and what he described as his (inaudible ). Let's practice together. Remember a time that you were actually in a safe moment but had a reaction like you felt that you were in danger. For my client he will remember that time when the police was speeding by, sirens blown and his automatic thought was this is terrible, I can't handle this and may be one of my buddy's have been hurt. The next step is to get very clear about current safety. If there is nothing apparent then in this moment I'm safe is the general starting point. If you're right now in a situation which is actually unsafe then leave and get to safety. Since, you're listening to this recording right now we'll start with the assumption and the premise of safety. My client wrote, "In this moment, I'm safe and then, I see the police speeding by and hear sirens, yeah, here I am and I'm okay, I'm safe. The police are doing their job and those sirens, those sirens don't have anything to do to with me. In this moment I'm okay." Now it's your turn. Find a moment in time, when you had an automatic fearful feeling and then rewrite the ending with few positive statements, like of those in my client's story. Repeat the positive ending to yourself and notice how this can change your feelings and ease your automatic response. Practice this whenever you find yourself reacting automatically with a fear response, that's something that's not truly dangerous. Practice this again throughout the day whenever you need to recapture feelings of comfort or calm. Take the time right now to form a new healthy practice habit, take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky, from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember daily practice is not a luxury item, until tomorrow have a gentle day.
