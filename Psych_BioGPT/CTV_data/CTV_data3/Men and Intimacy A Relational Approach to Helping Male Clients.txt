Men in Therapy: What Clinicians Need to Know Men and Intimacy: A Relational Approach to Helping Male Clients Patrick Dougherty

RICH SIMON Welcome. My name's Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker, and I would like to welcome you to this installment of our webcast series on men in therapy. So in our series we're gonna be looking at this whole issue of men in therapy and the ways in which often therapy, uh, therapists may not be offering the most congenial environment for helping men benefit from psychotherapy. And we're very fortunate today to have with us as our guest, Patrick Dougherty, who's, uh, been working with, uh, been a therapist for longer than he cares to remember, been working with men that entire time. Patrick, welcome today. 

00:00:55
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Rich, glad to be here. 

00:00:55
RICH SIMON All right, so let's, we're gonna start here in a, a somewhat unusual direction, perhaps. This is not the direction we, uh, that people might normally associate with, uh, finding their way towards working with men. But your work over the last 20 years, you've presented often at the Networker symposium and written for our magazine and made a great contribution over all that time, uh, has been very influenced by mindfulness, by Eastern spiritual practice, you're a tai chi practitioner, quite an accomplished one, um, so how do we get from mindfulness to focusing on your, this particular approach to working with men that we're gonna be talking about? So what happened, tell us first about your, how mindfulness changed your practice as a psychotherapist. 

00:01:50
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Well, coming from, uh, a tai chi and a qigong perspective, a Chinese, Eastern perspective, we don't call it “mindfulness,” we call it “presence” or “heart-centerness,” but it's basically the same thing. So, um, it, it taught me how to breathe. Back in about the mid-90s, I learned to breathe in the middle of a therapy session. It changed everything. 

00:02:15
RICH SIMON It, it's a handy thing to able, yes. 

00:02:20
PATRICK DOUGHERTY And then one day I had a radical notion of asking a client to breath. 

00:02:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, okay. 

00:02:25
PATRICK DOUGHERTY And it changed history. 

00:02:25
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:02:25
PATRICK DOUGHERTY So I began to bring in these practices, these little techniques I had learned in my qigong practice. I was studying with a Chinese qigong master and meditating hours a day and teaching qigong and, and I began to bring in, uh, presence, uh, breathing and a heart-centeredness with my clients. And I thought I had found the missing link. Here was, here was a thing that we were missing. It was actually in our body, and it was in our hearts, and especially for men. I wasn't focused on men at the time; I had already done that. I'd been there, done that, figured it out, moved on. 

00:03:05
RICH SIMON Getting your men's movement mowed in the, the 90s? Your men's retreats and all that stuff, okay. 

00:03:10
PATRICK DOUGHERTY This is Minnesota, we were up in the woods, howling and doing all that great stuff. 

00:03:15
RICH SIMON Beating your drums and 

00:03:15
PATRICK DOUGHERTY That's right. And I thought I had it nailed. I really did. I've had shame figured out, I had men figured out, and moved on to finding my heart and my breath. And so I wrote my first book, Qigong in Psychotherapy, and it was a book for therapists and their clients, how to bring in sort of a mindfulness, if you wanna use that word, but a presence and our breathing and how to be in your heart. And I got to the last chapter which was about the heart, and I ended the book there. It was from a workshop I had taught for many years. And then I was ready to write my opus. Here was, I was gonna change the course of psychotherapy, of course. You never start small at this age, you know? You wanna start to hit the grand slam. But as I watched the work I did with men and women, I realized that, oh my God, I could get people into their hearts, I could get them into their breath, I could get them feeling really good, and they weren't any more relational than they ever were. It was amazing. It was amazing. I could sit in my office with this beautiful face and in my heart and holding them in my heart, everybody felt good and it didn't change a lot of anything. It didn't change their capacity to be in relationship. And, Rich, after all these years, of 30-some years as a therapist and 60 as a wanderer on the planet, looking for the sort of, uh, the, the pill of happiness, what's so clear to me is that happiness is only found in any sustained way through relationships, intimate relationships, because they drop us into this humble, heart-centered place and that's where we find the Buddha, that's where we find God, that's where we see the stars and the fireworks. So I, I've had many profound spiritual experiences, could guide my qigong students into profound moments of spiritual bliss, and it didn't change much of anything. And so I just thought, “Oh my God, I'm missing something here,” and it happened to be in relationship. And I didn't find that out until I was at this place of realizing my new, wonderful theory was no more effective than anything I practiced, and this wonderful woman showed up in my life who's now my partner. She's a therapist, and she had been working with men for a long time, and she had this radical approach to working with men that was pretty profound. And what it was was dropping into a deep and radical relationship with her male clients. So it's not an approach I would've thought of, dropping deeper into a relationship 

00:06:15
RICH SIMON You're a man, how would you know about having a relationship? 

00:06:20
PATRICK DOUGHERTY You know, arm wrestling, uh, you know, we're gonna be ninjas, we're gonna attack them, we're gonna take them apart. But she sort of opened this door for me, uh, personally and professionally, about the need to be in deep and radical relationship. And looking at men in the culture right now, we all know things are not getting better for men. There's a cultural acceptance of the self-absorbed, narcissistic man. Most of us are just shrugging our shoulders and saying, “Well, that's how they are.” And even when I talk to my colleagues about working with men I, you know, I'll, especially my women colleagues, I'll say, you know, “I'm teaching a course on man,” and they'll say, “Oh my God, I'm gonna send half my clients to it. I don't know what to do with these guys.” And half of them say, “I'm gonna send my husband,” you know? So 

00:07:10
RICH SIMON Forget my clients, I'm sending my husband to you. Yeah. 

00:07:15
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Yeah, so I mean, it's like we, we have unfortunately collaborated with the culture and set the bar pretty low for men, I think. In therapy, we don't expect nearly as much of men as we do of women. And boy, that, that is just 

00:07:30
RICH SIMON Say a little bit more about that. So what, in what way don't we expect more of men? Then, and then you'll go on and talk about this idea of radical relationship, that concept, all kinds, we'll get to that in a moment. Stay with this first thing first. 

00:07:45
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Well, we, we really, we, we have this mindset of men that they're not capable of too much, and so if we get them in our office, uh, we're gonna hold their hands, we're be kind, we're gonna coddle them, we're gonna, if they get defensive and shameful or angry, we're gonna back off, we're gonna really be very careful with these guys. And they pick up, they know exactly what that means, that they're not expected to do much. You know, that they can get away with that like they have. And so we are part of the culture, you know, we aren't the old radicals that a lot of us imagined back in, back in the 70s or perhaps were. But we're part of the culture, and we, I think, have part of that mindset, that cultural mindset that is lowering our expectations of men, and I believe there is this sort of growing vortex of narcissism out there, of self-absorption that's only getting larger for men. And so this is where sort of this radical approach, it's like we, we cannot go along with the cultural norm, we cannot, we cannot say that's what we accept. If we wanna teach men to be in relationships, we have to be willing to go deep in relationship with them. We can't sit back and be detached therapists, we can't teach couples communication, we can't just go for insight. I think we have to drop deep inside of ourself and show up in relationship with these men. 

00:09:25
RICH SIMON Okay. So, so let's get people a, an immediate sense of that and what that actually means and how you, how you, uh, and I know this is a term you, you like to use a lot, “embody” this in, in how you operate as a psychotherapist and the kind of radical relationship that you're developing with your clients. 

00:09:45
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Great. Great question. There's a four-step process that I think about when I start every session. The first thing I do, and this is something that I didn't learn in my mindfulness, my meditation practice, I learned how to be in my heart, but what we wanna start with is I always want to embody. What I wanna do is I wanna drop my consciousness into my body. And what's important about this, and I'll talk more about this in a few minutes, is when we embody, we don't, I can find the, the piece in my body immediately. I can find the meridians, I can open up the channels, I can sit cross-legged, I can get into my heart, and my body can feel perfectly at peace. However, the problem with that is when you're in an intimate relationship, a perfectly peaceful body usually is not what you experience. 

00:10:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:10:55
PATRICK DOUGHERTY That's right. It's our nervous system. If you're gonna be in an intimate relationship with anybody, you're gonna have to be, have access to your nervous system. 

00:11:05
RICH SIMON Fitting together and 

00:11:05
PATRICK DOUGHERTY That's right. Because what happens when your nervous system is online is that you have all your reactions, you have your longing, you have your defensiveness, and there you are, engaged in humanity. So in, in spiritual practice, we bypass all that. We call it the “spiritual bypass.” I'm at one with the universe, and I'm alone with the universe, but that doesn't matter. 

00:11:30
RICH SIMON Me and my good friend the universe, forget about you. 

00:11:35
PATRICK DOUGHERTY And we feel sorry for everybody else down there, but, uh, so when I say “embody” I wanna drop into my body and I wanna recognize what sensations I have going on, anything going on in my body that's gonna tell me about something either about where I'm at or where I'm at sitting with this client across from me. So I'll sit down with some people and I'll just take a breath and I'll drop into my body, and I'll feel an anxiety or I'll feel myself pulling back or I'll feel an excitement. And I, I need to know what that is ’cuz that's happening in the room, they're picking it up on some level, and I need to be tracking with what's happening in my body. So the first step, I wanna embody. The second step, thank God I've, I found a place for the heart in this, is that the heart actually does bring a lot into the therapy relationship, as long as it's embodied. ‘Cuz when you're in your heart, when you open up your heart energy, and you don't need to know anything about any spiritual practice to open up your heart energy, you drop your consciousness into your heart, and you're there. ’Cuz what happens when you're embodied and you sit with a client and you drop into your heart, you immediately have respect, compassion, there's a human across from you who is in your office because they're suffering. You know about suffering because you're a human and you've been hopefully on the couch a few times yourself. And so you just, you begin to drop out of the sort of professional, “I'm the therapist, you're the client,” and all of a sudden, you're there as a therapist in relationship. So the second one is the heart-centered. The third step is attunement. So attunement, and you've gotta be in your body to attune to another person. Most of us know about attunement from our children, about how you can really track with small babies and children, you, when they smile, you smile, when they cry, you cry, and you just sort of, you have this beautiful attunement. And when you're first with your sweetheart, your lover, your partner, you've got that connection with each other that you just, yeah, it's beautiful. And so we know what that sort of attunement feels like, and so what I wanna do, the third step is I wanna sort of be in my body, in my heart, and then sort of tune in to the other person. How are they now the fear in my office? Are they anxious, are they present, are they connected, are they stressed out? I'm, I'm opening what a lot of us would call the intersubjective field, the energy us old Dahlists would call it. What's the energy happening between us? So I'm tapping into the, uh, into the attunement. The fourth step, then, and this gets more and more dynamic as you spend time with the client, is then you go for attunement, or, excuse me, for coherence. And what coherence is is that means I am gonna hold everything that this client has brought into the office up to this point. ‘Cuz one of the things that happens a lot in therapy with all clients but especially with men is that they come in in crisis, they come in churned up about, “My wife told me I gotta get help or gone,” or “I'm having trouble with my kids,” and they'll come in sort of like, “Help me right now.” And about the fourth session, their intensity and their involvement in therapy is dropping considerably. And that's when I am the one holding the coherence and that I keep weaving back in if he doesn't what he said walking in the door. An example would be a guy walked in who was having a really hard time with his kids and being really sort of mean with his kids. Did four, six sessions, he was doing pretty well. Eight sessions out, he hadn't talked about the kids in four sessions. And I said, so I'll call him John, I said, “John, so you haven't talked about your kids in a while. How's that going?” He said, “Oh, that's better,” wanting that conversation to end. And I said, “So, great. I'm glad it's better. So, is it better, does that mean you're less mean or you're not mean anymore, you're mean half as much?” and he just got ashamed again and embarrassed and said, “You know, I'm still struggling.” And so I came back in with the coherence. I didn't let that float away like I might've in the past and let him only bring it up when he was comfortable, which with men is so important. We cannot wait and let them bring up the material only when it's comfortable for them. This is where coherence comes in. So I wanna embody myself, I wanna sink into my heart, I wanna attune, and then I wanna hold all of the pieces that have come into the office thus far. That's how I start. 

00:17:00
RICH SIMON Okay, so let's, uh, I can feel the, how these, these different, uh, principles, these themes relate to your work. I can feel them in our conversation here, changing my awareness of having our chat here, our virtual chat. And, uh, let, let's take it to the next step, and, uh, what I, I wonder, can you give us, tell us a story here. Tell us, uh, uh, describe a case in your practice and show us how you put these ideas and practices to work in, uh, with an actual client of yours. 

00:17:40
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Great, I just, I just had this happen this last week with a client of mine. I'll call him, uh, Bob. Banker, nice guy, good all-American, well-dressed, he does everything right. Good, good guy. So he came in and he said, uh, he came in about three, four months ago now, and he said, “Patrick, I'm here because my wife said, you know, ‘Maybe it's time you packed up and moved across the street or across town, and, you know, I'm just tired. You bring nothing to the marriage. You know, you'll only do what I tell you to do, and I'm tired of, tired of working hard to have both of us in this relationship.’” And he had promised her many times he was gonna do therapy, and so he was in here now, and he was very scared that she was very, very serious. So he talked about, um, how hard he tries to get things right. He, perfectionist, really an anxious guy, could just feel him in here, sort of saying, “So what do I do? Tell me how to do it. Tell me what, what should I, what should I tell her?” And so I'm asking him to drop into his body. So one of the first things I'm doing is I'm teaching my clients what I'm practicing. So I said, “Bob, can you just drop into your body and just tell me what's going on?” and he's just looking at me like, “What are you talking about? I'm not here to be in my body. I'm here to get some answers,” right? That's right. And about the third, yeah, about the third or fourth time I asked him to drop into his body, he said, “What the f- am I going in my body for?” and I said, “That very reason, Bob. Because you hate it.” And what he recognized is that he lives with such anxiety and that what he tries to do is just keep moving to keep in front of his anxiety. So we established the fact that he had a lot of anxiety and that he was sure if he just knew how to talk with her, he could, he could get it right. So he talked about how hard he tried to get things right, and every once in a while he said, “I sort of, I get a little passive aggressive.” So what you know when you're working with somebody who's really passively dependant like this guy is, that there's a lot of aggression going on that he's just trying to hide from and hates about himself. So he came in one day and he talked about something that happened with his assistant last week. So he had a client walking in, a big report due, and he's got this wonderful assistant who knows how anxious he is and tries really hard to get everything perfect and tries to get him the perfect birthday cake which was coming up and tries to work her vacation around his vacation and, really nice woman. And he walked in with this big report and put it in front of his client and there was a big mistake that they both had missed, and the client sort of said, “What's this?” and he was humiliated. And, uh, so he walked back into his office and his assistant said, “Well, so, so Bob, how did it go?” and he threw the report on her desk and he put his finger on the mistake and he said, ”Maybe if you wouldn't spend so much time on cakes and vacations, you would've seen this.” And he walked away. And that's what I did, I just, and so sitting in myself, I'm watching myself go “Oh my God,” and I'm just, I'm feeling judgmental toward the guy and I'm going ”Oh my, oh.” And I see him turning red, I see him starting to collapse in shame, and I said, “So what's going on?” He said, “I felt so humiliated that I would do that to her. Just humiliated.” And I said, “Well, what'd you do?” and he said, “Well, a day later I sent her an email and I said ‘I'm sorry. You know what I'm like,’ and she wrote back and said, ‘Yes, I do. Don't worry about it.’” And I said, “So that was it?” and he said, “Yeah.” And I said, “Wow. Bob, that is one of the meanest things I've heard somebody do in a long time.” So what I was doing right there is I was being very direct with him. I could see his shame, I knew this was gonna trigger his shame, but I wanted to do a relational intervention. I could've gone with his humiliation, I could've gone with the family upbringing which certainly came in, but what he didn't understand is the impact he had on others, this, at this point, his assistant, often on his wife. And he said, “What are you talking about?” and I said, “Oh my God, what an aggressive thing to say to her. I bet she was just shattered.” And he said, “Well, I apologized,” and I said, “Well, you didn't apologize for being mean.” And he said, “Do you think I was mean?” and he was just sort of like a bewildered kid. And I said, “Oh, it was really mean, Bob,” and he said, “Oh. I need to do something more, I think, don't I?” And I said, “Yes, you do,” and he said, “You know, she's not been the same since then.” And then I leaned in and I said, “Bob, good for you. You just found some empathy. You can see in her her suffering.” And so then again, I was working with the relationship, that he needed to not just be lost in his shame and collapse, but really understand the impact it had on his assistant. Yeah. So I'm tracking with my body, and I'm tracking with my sensations, I'm staying in my heart, and I'm watching the attunement. What's interesting when you're working with men around these issues, when they trigger it, you can feel them leave. You can feel them check out which is what our partners and wives usually feel. It's like all of a sudden, he's there, but he's not there. He's talking, but there's no connection anymore. 

00:23:50
RICH SIMON It's palpable. 

00:23:50
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Yeah, yeah. And, you know, guys often say, “She says, ‘Well, where are you?’ and I don't know what the hell she's talking about.” And I'm saying, “I know what she's talking about.” 

00:24:00
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:24:00
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Yeah. So then he walked in a couple weeks later, and he said, I, he said, “I had this little problem at home. I walked in the house and my wife was furious. I took the baby clothes out of the washer, I didn't fold them, I didn't put them away, and she gave me that rant.” And he sort of rolled his eyes, and he said, “You know what it's like.” So then I asked him, I said, “So what did you say back to your wife?” and he had that sort of look on his face, his jaw was clenched, and he said, “Well, the only thing I could think to say to her was, ‘Well, there's nothing new about that, is there?’” And I looked at him and I said, “Well, what did she do?” And he said, “Well, she just turned away and stormed off.” And I said, “Boy, Bob, you really have a way of being aggressive, don't you?” And he sort of had that startled look again, and I could watch his mind begin to work, and he said, “Oh, that's what that is. I didn't know what it was that pissed her off so much, I just know I pissed her off, but, boy, that really is aggressive, isn't it?” So it was wonderful to see him connect the dots so quickly, that he understood he started bringing forward his aggression ‘cuz he hated to be like his father. We'd, we'd, you know, went into where it came from, and his father was very caustic, and he didn't wanna be that way. And he hated to be in conflict ‘cuz he imagined conflict was always gonna be terrible so he pretended like he was always gonna correct his behavior, but he was just this passive-aggressive guy. And it was my holding my care and respect for him that kept him in his body enough that he could have enough clarity within himself and the empathy for his wife about what a lousy thing that was to do to his wife. 

00:26:10
RICH SIMON So in both these examples with, with, uh, with Bob, uh, what happens? So it's one thing, you know, so one of the, the points you're, seems like you're really, uh, emphasizing here is let's raise the bar, let's not let guys get away with stuff. So in terms of the assistant and also with the wife, what was the, in addition to what happens in the session, what, is there a, in ei-, in either of those cases is there a, or examples, is there a follow-up? 

00:26:40
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Well, let me, let me change the language a little bit, Rich, because you've framed it in a way that we often think about it in, in the field. It's like we're not gonna let this guy get away with that. 

00:26:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:26:50
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Okay, so that's the old way, we're gonna go after him and we're gonna make him accountable like our teenaged son, we're gonna make him, make sure he does his homework and not. It, it, when we treat him that way, they know, they know we have this attitude toward them. 

00:27:10
RICH SIMON Oh, great. Okay. Yeah. 

00:27:10
PATRICK DOUGHERTY So what I was doing was I was inviting him into a deep and radical and life-giving relationship. I was helping him be accountable for his behavior, but I was helping him understand what's possible. ‘Cuz in both cases, and this answers your questions, in both cases, when he went back and did the repair, as we call it, not just the apology, but the repair, both of them were so moved. His assistant was just, she had no words, she wasn't used to it from him to have him say, you know, “That was really mean, and you didn't deserve that from you. You really have done well on this. I should've caught that, and I'm really sorry,” and he bought her some flowers. And she just was flabbergasted about this anxious, perfectionistic boss of hers. And when he went back to his wife, I mean, it wasn't as sweet with his wife. You know, she said, uh, ”Well thank you for recognizing that. I've been waiting for that. And please stop it, dammit. Show up. Quit being that sort of passive, collapsed guy who's this passive-aggressive guy. I want, we get to argue in this relationship, so please show up.” So he came in just smiles and saying, “Oh, Patrick, she didn't get mad, I mean, she wasn't real happy, but she was really glad. And we had a nice night.” He said, “I just felt like there was more respect in the room for me from her.” And I said ”How about from you?” and he went, “Yeah. Yeah, I felt good about myself.” So there he was, having these experiences of a deep relationship and a feeling in his heart that opened, a feeling of respect for himself, and he had then a taste of what's possible. Yeah. 

00:29:05
RICH SIMON So, so that's, you know, so, uh, a very, I'm glad you drew this distinction between the, the reprimand and the invitation to the client. Um, so the, as you say that, the, there's the other piece of this, this is, this is what a great, uh, learning for this guy, and to discover a, a totally different way for him to repair relationship. Now, one of the reasons that we don't do often what you just did with your client is when the client pushes back against you as the therapist into the, “Well, what do you mean?” where they shut down or they don't, with all of your attunements and all of the other things that you've done to lay the groundwork. So talk about that, when, when that, when we go to plan B, when, when the clients are not so terribly, uh, especially guys, are not terribly so receptive to that kind of, um, uh, invitation that you're offering, that kind of, you know, and, and that, I don't know if confrontation's quite the word, but it's, it's not a reprimand confrontation, it's a, it's a challenge. It's a, it, it's a challenge to this, uh, people's way of operating. 

00:30:20
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Yeah. You know, that often comes up, especially in couples, when I watch a man in his relationship with his partner. So I had a couple three, four weeks ago now where, um, they came in and she has done a lot of work and knows her feelings and in her own therapy, and she finally got him to come in. And he, he is not able to articulate much at all about his feelings, and he's got that beleaguered look about him when he walks in the door. So I spent some time with him, asking him about his background and connecting with him in a way that he felt respected ‘cuz after about three sessions he said, “You know, I'm only here because I like you. I've been to a couple other therapists with my pervious wife and I hated those jerks.” But he said, “Somewhere I've, I like you, I feel like you like me and so that's why I'm still here.” 

00:31:20
RICH SIMON There's some trust with you, yeah. 

00:31:20
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Yeah. Yeah, and so, so when I work with a couple like this, I think it's critical that we're very, very honest, strong, and compassionate. Very early, probably in the second session, um, I'll call him Tom, I said, “Tom, all of us in this room know that, that your wife is way ahead of you in this process. Way ahead of you.” 

00:31:50
RICH SIMON Let's just, let, let's name the elephant right there. 

00:31:55
PATRICK DOUGHERTY That's right. “And I'm not gonna pretend like, you know, this is a relationship and it takes two and you both contribute equally to the problem,” which I used to say for many, many years, Rich. 

00:32:05
RICH SIMON As so many of us do, sure. 

00:32:05
PATRICK DOUGHERTY And oh, my word, and what, what a disservice to both of them. So I said, you know, “Tom, you really collapse in your shame a lot, and you feel sorry for yourself a lot, which is not uncommon, you know, it happens a lot, but I'm not gonna pretend like you guys are, you know, in an equal place here. And so you need to think about either doing your own therapy so you can catch up and you can get some attention which I would really strongly recommend, or you need to know we're gonna spend more time in this couples work working with you on your issues. And that's, we can do that. It's harder ‘cuz you're gonna feel ganged up on, but I want you to know that I'm not gonna pretend like it's equal here. You guys are not on equal footing.” So he said, “Well, let's try it in couples work. Let's, you know, I don't wanna do individual therapy, I wanna, you know, I'll come here, I'll come here as long as she's driving.” So he would collapse in his shame, and this man, he really wanted to be in this relationship. It was, uh, a new relationship, he wanted it to work, sincere guy, just grew up in a pretty traumatic household. But he really had no clue how to be in relationship. And so I said, “If we're gonna do this, here's some things you need to know,” and I say this to a lot of men, that “One is that you're gonna have to expect a lot more out of yourself and not let me or your wife expect more out of you. That you need to sign up to expect more out of yourself.” 

00:33:45
RICH SIMON Well that's, that's a powerful statement, isn't it? 

00:33:45
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Yeah. And then I said, ”Two is that you're gonna need to take a lot of risks, even when it's uncomfortable, even when you imagine that you can't go any further, I am gonna tell you when you can ‘cuz I am really good at this, I've been doing it 30 years, and I can tell that because you're so, you have so much shame and fear of being humiliated, you're very thin-skinned. So there's nothing wrong with being thin-skinned, but we can't let that stop us. So I'm gonna ask you, I'm gonna, you're gonna tell us how, how hard this is and I'm gonna say, ‘Yep,’ and we're gonna go right by it and we're gonna ask you to do more. And then I'm gonna ask you to count on me. When you're struggling, turn to me and tell me and ask me for help.” And so he was just looking like, ”Wow. Wow, there's, here's this guy leaning in to me,” and sure enough, 20 minutes later, he was collapsed in his shame and sort of saying, you know, “It's never good enough for you, honey. I'm always doing something wrong. It's everything, everything is always bad,” and I just said, “John, you're probably saying something right now you've said a thousand times,” and he laughed and said, “Yep,” and I said, “And there is no life, nothing new, there's no life in that statement. I want you to come forward and be more specific about what's happening to you, and I want you to drop into your body.” And his tears just started flowing out of his face and he said, “I have no idea why I'm crying.” But just helping him, sort of say, “Okay, you need to drop that old defensive stick. You're trying to ward everybody off, and I'm not buying into it. And I want you to drop into your body,” and what he was able to do after a few minutes, of be able to say, “I don't know what to do. I don't know how to respond when she says that to me.” And I said, “Oh, great beginning. How honest.” And she's got tears in her eyes, saying, “You've never told me that. I know you don't know, and you, and you make it about me.” And so we just had this moment, this beautiful moment of him owning, in his body, how much his heart hurt, the tears coming out, and him not being this defensive guy blaming his wife for how bad he feels. 

00:36:15
RICH SIMON Wow. So, as you're saying this, a couple of things occur to me. What a, you know, very powerful session, uh, and the interesting dynamic, and it reminds me of, um, of, of the, the, the word that comes across is this guy is accepting you as his coach. This is a relationship men understand. And the, the coach and it's, we're watching, I'm watching, at least, the playoffs now, and you have these moments where your coach is allowed to say things to you that you would not accept from anybody else once, and this, this is not a conversation one has in the first session with a guy who may not feel all that at home in the therapy environment. Does that resonate with you, the idea that you're, um, and, and maybe these things are not so classically, there's, there's a, there's an emerging, uh, thing in the culture of our field, it seems to me, of this cultural, there's a therapy role which has more to do with kind of the parental, renurturing and the attachment wounds and so forth, and there's something, and I think it's the men in the field who are beginning to develop this, and they're, uh, coming from a number of sources, as I'm hearing from you, to me that, that, that's the word that comes to mind. And, and, um, I'm curious to see how you react to that, if that fits with your experience of what you're, of, of this way of working. Being a coach doesn't mean that you're just behavioral, you don't go deeply into people's experience, but that the tone of address that you're, uh, you're demonstrating so powerfully for us reminds me of the, of a coaching form of address and not what we typically think of as the therapeutic voice. 

00:38:00
PATRICK DOUGHERTY You know, the word that I use in this, I had a man, a man in here yesterday who uses this word a lot, it, it, it's “mentor.” ’Cuz a coach is sort of telling, sort of, you know, telling him what to do, you know, “Come on back out, I'll, I'll give you a few pointers and go back in there.” And so, that's fine, but I think “mentor” is more relational, okay, which, what, and what it means is that sometimes, occasionally I'll share what I know from my own experience, but often I'll share my experience of the client with the client. You know, sometimes I make mistakes, sometimes I'm too, too strong and too direct. I had one guy a few weeks ago say, “You know, you're pushing me on my narcissism, you, you didn't hear me last week. I was hurting, and you wanted me to be responsible and accountable, and I think you had some agenda there. I don't think, I was hurting.” And I looked back at the session and I realized that I was sort of, I wanted to, I wanted to challenge on, him on his narcissism and I did it at a poor time. And I was able to say, “Oh, oh, you're right, I did. I was, I was sort of mad at you for the session before about your narcissistic rage, and I wasn't straight with that. I jumped on something else and, uh, you know, I do that sometimes.” 

00:39:25
RICH SIMON It requires some skill here, doesn't it? So it's better to say, “Uh-huh, uh-huh. How does that makes you feel?” 

00:39:35
PATRICK DOUGHERTY That's right. Well, and, and Rich, this is what's so exciting about this approach to therapy is that it calls us as the therapist into this humbling, human role of being in a deep relationship every day. And this guy yesterday saying, he's just sort saying, you know, “I've always wanted a mentor. My father was this depressed Norwegian guy who just said nothing to me, and I always was looking for an uncle or a neighbor, I always wanted someone to tell me how to do it. I had no idea how to call a girl, how to say something to a boy, how to apply to a school,” and he said, “I feel like you're this mentor father that I've always wanted.” And I just said, “Well, I'm very touched by that. Thank you,” I said, “I really appreciate your honesty, I appreciate your vulnerability, and I'm moved by your courage,” and we're having this moment of intimacy. That's really, really sweet. And he's just moved, and I'm moved. And it was around the word “mentor,” so I think I like that word a little better than “coaching.” 

00:40:40
RICH SIMON So let's stay with this for a second ‘cuz I think this is really important, and this is new territory and, and you have certain associations with this, with the coaching term, or a certain style of coaching, but let's stay with your term for the moment, so the mentor. So, so help us clarify this, ‘cuz this word, I think this is an area where the field is gonna be, a lot of things will change over these coming years in regard to this ‘cuz the more traditional role of psychotherapist is under assault by a lot, from a lot of different directions, and, and one of it is what we're talking about here. So make this distinction. So when you're in your mentor position and, uh, you're, how is that any different than being in what we think of or what you perhaps used to think of, more to the point, as your more traditional therapist role? What's the difference here? What does a mentor do or not do that a therapist does or doesn't do? 

00:41:35
PATRICK DOUGHERTY So a mentor knows what he knows or she knows through experience, not education or training. 

00:41:40
RICH SIMON Oh, that's interesting. Uh-huh. 

00:41:45
PATRICK DOUGHERTY A mentor comes at it, so if I'm coming at, if I wanna be with these men relationally, I'm bringing my whole relational history, my shames, my errors, my own narcissistic pockets, my own collapses, my own humanity. And so I come at it from a very human standpoint, knowing that these men don't wanna be where they are. I'm, I work with a couple guys that are very, very narcissistic and have this narcissistic rage and these tantrums and, and I know they don't wanna do that. And so, as a therapist and as a, a, as a human being, I can just feel so judgmental towards these guys and so angry and condescending. But when I drop into my heart and into the deep relationship, I can recognize little fragments of this in myself. I know these guys don't wanna be in that isolated world of a narcissistic pocket. And so I'm coming at it through my humanity, through my own life experience, and putting my hand out and saying, “Hey, I think I can help you out of that.” 

00:42:55
RICH SIMON So, and how would it sound if you were doing it as, not as the mentor coming from life experience, but the psychotherapist intervening? How does that sound? How does that look, how does that sound in contrast? 

00:43:10
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Well, a psychotherapist, I mean, I've got a tool bag, I've got 30-some years of training and all sorts of things, and I know all sorts of interventions, I know ways to frame things, I know a way to help people communicate better, and it, it would point out to these men in a narcissistic rage, I would point out how counterproductive it is to them, I would help them understand the impact on others, I would sort of maybe lead them to their traumatic childhood, I would do everything but be in relationship with them. 

00:43:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:43:45
PATRICK DOUGHERTY A few weeks ago, one of these guys was telling me about this tantrum where he just really, really was mean and nasty to this guy and this, this contractor. And I said, “You know, I'm glad you brought the story in, and let me tell you something, right. Now, before I tell you what I'm gonna tell you, I'm gonna tell you, I'm scared right now. I'm scared ‘cuz I can see how mean and nasty you can be. But I'm gonna go forward anyway because I know you don't wanna be like that.” And he was already dumbfounded. It's like, “My therapist is telling me he's scared of me at this moment, but he's also recognizing my humanity.” And I went on to say, “You had a tantrum like a 4-year-old, and you really hurt somebody, and you need to do something about it.” And he laughed, and he said, “Like what?” and I said, “Like apologize.” And he laughed, and he said, “Nobody's ever challenged me on that before.” So I would've found a therapeutic and a distancing way to challenge this guy, which I have from my own career, and I don't think it would've been as effective. “You should do this because of this,” and I would've, but I did it as a, as another man, as a human man, and telling him what it was like to be around him when he was in that energy state. 

00:45:05
RICH SIMON So the, this is, that I, I, this is very interesting, and, and so two things occur to me. So, now, I, the, what happens when this really, this is riskier than being an “uh-huh, uh-huh” therapist or even “I know an intervention that I can use in this situation, and I went to a workshop two weeks ago, I'm gonna try it here.” So tell us about, when does this blow up in your face? When does it, when does it really lead to things where it's either very difficult to repair the relationship with the client or, perhaps on occasion, you really can't even repair it, so it takes you really at that kind of boundary of the, uh, the effective therapy where you, maybe in retrospect, you might even think maybe this was inappropriate to, to try this with this, this client ‘cuz it's a higher, it is a higher risk way of, uh, developing relationship. 

00:46:00
PATRICK DOUGHERTY So a couple months ago, I was working with a couple in about the fourth or fifth session, and the woman again had been doing lots of work, was in her own therapy, and this was their second marriage. Uh, I think it was his third marriage, actually. And she was trying to have communication with him, trying to connect with him, and he was a really good husband until she encroached on his time. And 

00:46:30
RICH SIMON She actually expected him to, she created, she would've done, he could've been the ideal husband. 

00:46:35
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Yeah. And when she pushed him, she was a feisty woman, and when she pushed him, he would just level her, especially with a couple drinks. So he made it clear very early on, he said, you know, “So I wanna tell you what, I don't trust therapist, I don't like therapy, I know you guys are always wanting to blame somebody's parents. My parents were good people, so just don't even go there.” 

00:47:00
RICH SIMON Don't go there. Okay. 

00:47:00
PATRICK DOUGHERTY So she came in, they came in and talked about an episode where he had just leveled her with this meanness, and he, this guy had a gaze that, uh, you didn't wanna be on the end of. And she talked about how hurtful it was and she just didn't know if she could continue, you know, to take that from him. And he said, “So, so Boss,” he called me Boss, “So Boss, what do I do? What do I do?” And so I gently, the gentlest, I said, ”So what, what do you, what do you think that behavior comes from? What do you know about that?” He said, “Well, it's drinking. When I, if I drink, it's because of the drink.” And I said, “Well, drinking usually lets out what's in there, and maybe you drink because it helps you. Do you have any idea of where that might come from, where that level of anger and hurt toward others might come ‘cuz I know that you've done some of that in your previous marriages.” And he turned his look at me, that gaze, and sort of, my whole system went into, it's like, “Oh my God, this guy's gonna come at me.” And he had that look in his eyes, and he said, “What are you suggesting?” 

00:48:15
RICH SIMON Oh, wow. 

00:48:15
PATRICK DOUGHERTY And it was one of those moments where it was like, “Oh my God, this is a make or break moment,” ‘cuz I knew I couldn't, I couldn't use kid gloves with this guy ‘cuz this, what he was doing to his wife was just so vicious, and this was one of those moments where I just knew that I had to have the courage to step forward, you know, ‘cuz they signed on and I signed up, and I stepped forward and I said, “I think you have some, a lot of anger and hurt that comes out as really anger and nasty rage coming from some place in your past.” And he just, about three sentences, just came at me and said, “I knew it. I knew you're all like this,” and he just, it was just like, I mean, it, it was like a scalpel coming at me. And I just, I stayed right there, and I said, “I know you believe that, and I believe something else. I believe this is not who you are. I don't believe it's the alcohol. I believe that you're on the verge of sinking your third marriage, and if you don't get ahold of this, I believe it's not gonna work out between you.” And they got up about three minutes later and I never heard from them again. But it was one of those moments where I knew that to, to not speak the truth would not have integrity. I knew it would leave her grappling with it at home, and I knew that as the therapist who just, who welcome these people into my office, I had to be willing to say it. And I went home shaking that night. I went home shaking and shaken. And it was like, I went for a walk and I did my breathing and I did my meditation practice, and it was hard. It was hard, but I, for my own integrity, I couldn't do anything else, and my respecting his humanity, and I didn't believe for a second he wanted to be locked in that world. He might not ever come out of it, but I wasn't gonna just collaborate with him being in it. 

00:50:25
RICH SIMON Yep. So now, did the wife stay in touch with you following that session? 

00:50:30
PATRICK DOUGHERTY No. I have no idea. 

00:50:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:50:35
PATRICK DOUGHERTY No idea. 

00:50:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Interesting. So, I mean, what makes it possible in, as I'm, uh, listening to this, is that communication, as you, uh, thinking lightly on your feet here, that you believe that there's more to the client, that you're never reducing the client to their most destructive or obnoxious behavior. And I think the message that you leave, that they have other possibilities, so that's a big part of being able to, uh, confront people, because you do, you have a genuine respect for, for there being more to them than whatever unfortunate behavior that may be manifesting at that moment. 

00:51:20
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Yeah, Rich, what I know is that every one of these men, no matter what sort of behavior they're exhibiting, no matter what struggle they have in their relationships, somewhere, they're coming from relationship trauma. It might be early attachment issues, it could be childhood deprivation or trauma, they, they come by it honestly. No man, no man wants to live in shame. No man wants to live in that sort of arrogant, grandiose, narcissistic world. They don't wanna live there, no matter what they tell you. So I'm always going for the higher good. And one of the things that I, I learned this from Lois, my partner, that starting every session, and most of my clients who are around for a while have heard me say this, that starting every session, what I know is that if they lean in, and I lean in, that what's possible in every session is beyond what we could imagine. Because it's intimacy, because it's relational, because when you're, two people are willing to engage, magic can happen. You can go places that one person can't on their own. And when you're willing to do that, when you're willing to drop into that deep and radical relationship again and again, you see these things happen more often, these moments of just sort of how did we get here? How did this happen? And they, yeah, so it's just, again, the beauty of being in a relationship with a client. 

00:52:55
RICH SIMON So now, as we, in, in the, uh, the tradition of, don't try this at home, kids, without the supervision of the, without carefully reading the instructions. So this is, if I'm a 25-year-old therapist, fresh out of graduate school and I'm seeing clients, this would seem to not be the first way of conceiving of my role, that I might, I might wanna embark upon. I'm, uh, that's what occurs to me. So what, how, how does, how does this fit into your view of the development of the therapist and, and in the supervision and training you do, put this in context with us. ‘Cuz you're, uh, clearly in these stories you're telling us are things that, and this mentor role, using more of one's life ex-, you have to have some life experience, that it's a guidance. You know, of course, to me, being a, the 27-year-old, um, family therapist dealing with people who've been married for 25 years, you know, trying to remember, what would Salvadore Minuchin do all the time in my sessions. But, but in terms of how you, um, advise therapists and guide them and train them, where does this kind of, uh, work that you're talking about the role, how does that fit into your sense of how therapists were, were capable of at different stages of our careers? 

00:54:25
PATRICK DOUGHERTY So what I say to young therapists is that yyou want to find a supervisor, you want to find a consultant who's willing to be relational. You don't want someone to sit back and teach you and sort of just be the, the guiding, uh, wise figure in the room. You want someone who's gonna bring their humanity in. And if you can't find it in a trainer or supervisor, raise the bar for yourself in every personal relationship in your life. That, do your therapy, go home, be with your partner, be with your good buddies, and know that what's possible every time you get with somebody is beyond what you can imagine. You've gotta be willing to take risks, you gotta be willing to put your heart out there, you gotta be curious about where you bump against the walls, that it's unlimited what's possible in the depth of a relationship. And so if you didn't get it in your training, which none of us did, then find it in your life and keep dropping deeper and deeper and deeper into your body, find out what gets in the way, work with it, and go back and drop deeper again. 

00:55:45
RICH SIMON Wow. Uh, let's just take that in for a moment. That sounds like very powerful, feels like very powerful advice as you're saying it, and, um, I think I, uh, what a lovely spot to punctuate this conversation, and we'll see if we can bring you back for webcast audiences and see if we can continue this conversation. So for now, since we don't have much time, um, for people who are interested in finding out more about how you think about therapy and training opportunities and, and, uh, in addition to what the, the advice and your, the, um, this vision that you've just offered us, where do they go and what might they look into? 

00:56:35
PATRICK DOUGHERTY So my first book, Qigong in Psychotherapy, is Amazon.com and at your, not at your favorite bookstore, but online. Um, again, it's great for mindfulness, great for dropping into your body and into your heart and good for teaching the clients some breathing, embodying techniques. It's a, it's a great book for that. Uh, I have a website called theheartembodied.com, theheartembodied.com. I just started to blog again, and I'm blogging about men, working with men. And, uh, teaching right now, I've backed off my teaching for a while ‘cuz I'm just starting to hunker down for another book, writing my third book. I'm putting that together and it's on working with men. So you can sign up on my website for announcements, and I'll keep you posted on my trainings and my writings and, uh, and watch me at the Networker. Uh, been around for a long time. Thank you for that, and, uh, glad to be part of this, Rich. Very, very grateful. 

00:57:45
RICH SIMON Great, great. So let me invite those of you who've been listening here, so we have our comment board. Uh, so you have some thoughts you've churned up by the, what Patrick's been talking about, his stories, the way his, his presence, the, what he's just shared with all of us, take a moment now, crystallize it for yourself, put it in words, um, share it with the rest of us, and let's keep this conversation going. It's, it's, uh, it's, it's quite a conversation. Uh, uh, Patrick will take a look at your comments, and there's no guarantee he'll respond, but given what we've seen of Patrick, if he is, is so moved, I think he'll, you'll get a pretty honest response from this guy. 

00:58:30
PATRICK DOUGHERTY I certainly will. Yeah. 

00:58:30
RICH SIMON Thank you, my friend. This is, what an interesting conversation, and what a pleasure to spend time with you. 

00:58:35
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Well, Rich, thank you, and the last thing I would want everybody to remember is that these men need us, and we need them ‘cuz they are us. 

00:58:45
RICH SIMON Yep. Yep. Well put. Okay, well, we'll, thank, that's, that's it for this afternoon. Uh, it ended in ways that none of us could've predicted at the beginning, and neither of us could predict where it's gonna go from here. I look forward to hearing on the comment board and through other, uh, uh, channels of communication what, what people, uh, people's responses to today's conversation. That's, that's it for right now, so from the Psychotherapy Networker webcast series, goodbye for now. 

00:59:20
PATRICK DOUGHERTY Bye-bye.
