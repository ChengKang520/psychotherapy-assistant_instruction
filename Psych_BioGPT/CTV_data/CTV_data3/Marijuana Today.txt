00:00:15
JODY As marijuana legalization and normalization continue to increase and the medicinal benefits are being researched, what are the risks? Regardless of your view, it's important we understand the risks, particularly for adolescents, teenagers and young adults. I never thought marijuana could be harmful until my son's marijuana habit grew into addiction and eventually he had a psychotic break. I couldn't understand how this was happening. No one, not even some professionals could believe that it was just pot. But it was just pot. How could marijuana be so destructive? So I set out to find some answers. My journey took me across United States and into rehabs and research centers where I began to hear the same thing everywhere I went. Today's marijuana is not the same drug that it used to be. My son had no history of mental illness. He was a good student, a star athlete, he had many friends, he was on track for college. Our family was turned upside down by this seemingly harmless drug. So why is this happening now to so many young people? Here's what I found out. 

00:01:35
Dr. Eden Evins, MD, MPH, Cox Family Psychiatry Professor Harvard/Director MGH Center for Addiction Medicine 

00:01:40
EDEN EVINS I'm the Cox family, ah, professor of psychiatry in the field of Addiction Medicine at Harvard Medical School and I direct the Center Prediction Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Marijuana use carries the risk of addiction, ah, particularly people start early in their life so, ah, adolescents who use regularly have a one in six chance of becoming addicted to marijuana, that risk goes up if they use daily. There's a withdrawal syndrome with, with marijuana use and people who used heavily described dysphoria, trouble sleeping, ah, craving which is I think the key symptom. 

00:02:15
Maggie age 18, Chicago, IL 

00:02:20
MAGGIE I actually wish that when I was in middle school and they taught the drug program and you don't know how they go through all the facts and this is how many people died from this year and blah, blah, blah and they're just trying to scare you and you're like, "Oh, they're just trying to scare me." You know, I wish they had someone come in like me and talk about what they had actually been through because you can't push that aside and say, "Oh, they're just trying to scare me." You know, that's real, that's the living proof that that person has gone through that and I think that's-- it's a lot more powerful to see someone saying this is what happened with me and it could happen to you. 

00:02:55

Dr. Kenneth Duckworth Medical Director, (NAMI) National Alliance on Mental Illness 

00:03:00
KENNETH DUCKWORTH Ah, one of the areas that I think has been a, ah, public health failure as it relates to the issue of the increasing acceptance and legalization of marijuana is the, ah, lack of understanding that there's a risk of psychosis, ah, for teenagers who are using a marijuana. Ah, the literature is quite clear that teenagers are taking an additional risk of developing a psychotic illness when they're smoking marijuana. This risk is particularly pronounced for people who have a family history of psychosis, 

00:03:30
F.A.I.R." Families & Adolescents in Recovery John McGuinness, Program Director, Chicago, Illinois 

00:03:30
JOHN MCGUINNESS Most of our kids coming in suffer from a marijuana use disorder which means they're either dependent or abusive on marijuana but it is the primary drug that we see with adolescents coming in to treatments. Literally, 85% of our kids carry a marijuana diagnosis with them 

00:03:55
Why Use Marijuana Tom age 13, Chicago, IL 

00:04:00
UNKNOWN My parents divorced was a big part of it. I couldn't deal with my emotions. Uhm, it was hard for me to express my emotions. I didn't talk about them, I kept them inside so I didn't, uhm, talk about them and I, I had to get them out some way so I started to use. And, uhm, once I broke up with my girlfriend and that's when I really started to have a lot of emotional issue and that's when I-- my use really started to, uhm, to rise and I started using daily. 

00:04:25
Callie age 17, Boulder, CO 

00:04:30
CALLIE An age that many people get exposed to marijuana is in elementary school. I think that a lot of people either hear about it or their parents smoke it. I know that a huge problem in Boulder is that everyone and their mom smokes weeds so they're all smoking it together so there's nothing stopping that from happening. 

00:04:45
Brandon Bergman PhD Clinical Psychology Addiction medicine Harvard Medical/Mass General Hospital 

00:04:45
BRANDON BERGMAN I-- the insidious thing about marijuana-- our, our younger patients, it really does build a need for them i-- in the short term, right. It does help them feel less depressed or feel less anxious or feel more a part of. They're kind of social community of, of young peers. Uhm, the problem is in the long term, it ends up really getting in their way of being able to move forward with their lives. 

00:05:10
UNKNOWN Don't just get it. 

00:05:10
UNKNOWN Impress. 

00:05:15
MAGGIE Or just saying I'm afraid like, notices and they tell the panel to... 

00:05:15
Brad Rudd Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist San Luis Obispo, CA 

00:05:15
BRAD RUDD I see social anxiety and adolescence as the root concern. I don't know how to fit in, I feel uncomfortable and I'm looking for something to take the edge off. Kid's s o desperately are looking for a sense of community and to belong. That some kids will take a group of other kids that are smoking pot. 

00:05:35
James age 39, Los Osos, CA 

00:05:40
UNKNOWN For me it was like magical. Like it was like the answer for me. I, I wasn't, I wasn't shy, I wasn't apprehensive, I wasn't nervous anymore. 

00:05:50
Their Stories 

00:05:55
MAGGIE My drug of choice is BHO which is a concentrated form of THC so it's basically the same thing as smoking marijuana, only it's a lot stronger. I first used marijuana when I was 14. 

00:06:05
Austin age 17, Chicago, IL 

00:06:10
AUSTIN All I wanted was to smoke weed. I've could've do anything with my life but just smoke weed was all I wanted. 

00:06:15
Erica age 17, Boulder, CO 

00:06:15
ERICA I wanted to fit in mostly cuz most of my friends smoked and, well, they weren't really even my friends honestly. They were just acquaintances that I wanted to be around because they'd accept my company when we were all high together. 

00:06:30
Brandon age 20, Detroit, MI 

00:06:30
BRANDON My father passed away and I used to get like really depressed and my friends just-- I had a lot of friends that smoked weed and they told me that, you know, when you weed, it makes you relax, stay calm. 

00:06:40
Mike age 45, San Luis Obispo, CA 

00:06:45
MIKE I started smoking with my mom. Ah, I had a cold and I was staying home from school cuz I was sick and she said, you know, maybe the marijuana-- if I smoke some pot, would make me feel better. 

00:07:00
Joseph age 34, Homeless 

00:07:05
JOSEPH My name is Joseph, I'm 34-years-old. I'm from New Orleans Louisiana. No one end up where I'm at. Don't start, you know. Keep your, keep your mind clear. 

00:07:15
Jack age 21, Chicago, IL 

00:07:20
JACK When I speak about my first time getting high on marijuana, I describe it like falling in love. I knew right as it hit me that this was gonna be a big part of my life. 

00:07:30
Carlos age 37, Arroyo Grande, CA 

00:07:30
CARLOS I smoked pot with my cousins and, ah, my older cousins and from there things just spiraled out of control real fast. 

00:07:40
Evan age 24, San Louis Obispo, CA 

00:07:40
EVAN High school, between junior and senior years, uhm, at camp and I see, and I see marijuana for the first time. They told me I, I wouldn't feel anything from my first time but I found, I found it quite different. 

00:07:50
Matt age 52, Los Osos, CA 

00:07:55
MATT I was exposed to marijuana at the ripe old age of eight. 

00:07:55
TOM I first started smoking weed when I was 11. 

00:08:00
Nikki age 46, San Luis Obispo, CA 

00:08:00
NIKKI I was in my early 20s and one time I was just stressed out. It became a ritual and at-- during a while the ritual became a habit and after a while the habit became a necessity and I started self-medicating. 

00:08:20
JAMES Ah, I went to college and I wanted to experience different things. Ended up being in a band and my bandmates ended up kind of initiating me into the world of marijuana. 

00:08:35
JODY Through this journey I've learned that marijuana can lead to addiction, metal health issues, brain abnormalities, loss of motivation also known as Amotivational syndrome, physical issues as well as serious accidents and the negative effects can be seen in relationships, school finances, jobs and in reaching one's potential. 

00:08:55
Today's Marijuana Jodie Gilman Ph.D NeuroScience, Harvard/MGH Center for Addiction Medicine 

00:09:00
JODIE GILMAN It's not really the same drug anymore. It's, it's a much more highly potent drug. This becomes an even bigger problem with edibles because you don't know how much you're getting and there have been, you know, people who have gotten way more than they intended. 

00:09:15
Collin age 17, Chicago, IL 

00:09:15
Collin It's not just marijuana. So much stuff on the street these days, its laced. I have seen people lace their marijuana. 

00:09:25
TOM When you buy it illegally, you don't know what you're getting. I've bought, uhm, synthetic weed before, uhm, K2 which is, ah, pretty much just-- its fake weed and it's really bad for you. I've known some people who use that as a drug of choice. I just got it on accident. I didn't know the difference. 

00:09:45
Dr. Eden Evins, MD, MPH, Cox Family Psychiatry Professor Harvard/Director MGH Center for Addiction Medicine 

00:09:45
EDEN EVINS So the marijuana available today is much stronger than the marijuana used in the 60s and 70s. Ah, it's been bred to increase the THC content which is what's, ah, responsible for the high. And also to decrease the cannabidiol, ah, concentration called CBD which can actually reduce anxiety. So, ah, the Cannabis we're seeing today actually really causes more anxiety and paranoia. 

00:10:15
ADAM I had my friend come over and he invited two other people I didn't know. They, ah, packed a bong. I, ah, assumed it was weed and started smoking it and all of a sudden I felt like my heart pumping super-fast and I started seeing shapes and, and it got worse. You know, I started seeing things I couldn't like, sit up straight. 

00:10:40
Anneli Vikhaus MT-BC, Music Therapist 

00:10:45
ANNELI VIKHAUS Its definitely changed over the years. I no longer smoke because it was negatively affecting me. In the beginning it was fine, it was fine. I had those pleasurable effects but as time increased I felt myself getting really anxious and paranoid and really stuck in my head an over analyzing my thoughts and giving meaning to things that perhaps didn't have a meaning. 

00:11:05
Dr. Donald Misch Senior Vice-Chancellor Health and Wellness University of Colorado, Boulder 

00:11:05
DONALD MISCH I think there's a lot of data that should make us worry And the question is what kind of risk do you wanna take? 

00:11:15
There are more than 400 chemicals in marijuana More than 60 are Cannabinoids The 2 main chemicals are: THC: TetraHydroCannabinoids and CBD CannaBiDiol THC is a psycho-active compound-causing a "high" feeling. CBD is a non-psycho-active chemical-holding promise as a medicinal treatment. 

00:11:15
JODY There are more than 400 chemicals in marijuana. More than 60 are Cannabinoids. The 2 main chemicals are THC, TetraHydroCannabinoids and CBD CannaBiDiol. THC is a psycho-active compound-causing a "high" feeling. CBD is a non-psycho-active chemical-holding promise as a medicinal treatment. Today's marijuana plant has been bred to increase THC levels causing the CBD levels to decrease. This leaves a higher content of the powerful psycho-active chemical THC. 

00:11:55
Michael O'Brien RAS, FAC, CSC pacific Addiction Center San Jose, CA 

00:11:55
MICHAEL O'BRIEN The risks to adolescents smoking marijuana are always present. There's never a time that an adolescent can smoke marijuana when there is no risk. If they smoke higher potency marijuana, the chances of them having negative symptoms and/or some of the psychotic type symptoms are much higher 

00:12:15
JODIE GILMAN THC is the main psycho-active compound in marijuana and the THC content has gone up considerably. And that's a problem for research that's been done over the past, you know, 20 or 30 years because the, the people who have been smoking marijuana, you know, since the 60s are not smoking the same marijuana that kids are smoking today. THC content used to be one to 3% in a marijuana cigarette. Now it could be 10%-25% so it's not the same cannabis that, that your parents smoked. 

00:12:50
Joanna Mother, Flight Attendant 

00:12:50
JOANNA Marijuana is definitely his drug of choice so much so that when he went to rehab, it took him 54 days before the THC levels went down. 

00:13:00
at dispensary in Colorado Percent of THC in marijuana 

00:13:00
UNKNOWN Uhm, these guys have (inaudible ) in them. We got a whole bunch of different strains and just they're like $12 each. I would say hells angels about 26, gravestompers 17, ah, super lemon haze. What would you say, THC? Eighteen? (inaudible ) cripplers like 14.95. 

00:13:25
Avani G. Dilger MA, LPC, DTR, CAC Founder/Director, Natural Highs, Boulder, CO Dabs 

00:13:25
UNKNOWN The biggest dynamic that we're seeing right now is that people develop tolerance to THC so quickly that then they are very, ah, tempted to look for other drugs that provide an even more intense high. Big difference between low THC marijuana and let's say a marijuana product that we see kids use a lot right now which are edibles or which is hash oil or dabs. Ah, you know, up to 90% you see. The biggest concern that we see around that is of course kids like this feeling of being and keep-- they keep chasing the more and more and more dramatic high and then we know that kids go towards other drugs. 

00:14:05
Perception of Marijuana Dr. Donald Misch Senior Vice-Chancellor Health and Wellness University of Colorado, Boulder 

00:14:10
DONALD MISCH The perception that marijuana is dangerous has gone down. If you ask most students you'll find that, that many believe that the substance in benign or even better than benign, it's entirely therapeutic. The campus has been known for 420, ah, celebrations in the past which are no longer occurring and we come from a state that has now both decriminalized and commercialized marijuana. 

00:14:40
ERICA Generally, in Colorado, the perspective surrounding marijuana use is very positive. Everyone I ever talked to pretty much for a long time has been really excited about marijuana being really excited about marijuana being legalized. 

00:14:55
JODIE GILMAN People understand the risk of alcohol and we do education in our colleges and education in our high schools to teach people to drink responsibly. And right now that doesn't exist for marijuana. 

00:15:05
CALLIE Marijuana is absolutely everywhere especially in Boulder you see all over. It's almost on every single corner of every block. Uhm, and almost teenagers smoke if not all. There's a whole culture behind it where people almost expect you to start smoking because its legal here. People expect you to be like, "Oh, hey. Would you like to go smoke with me?" It's kind of just like a social thing to do. 

00:15:30
Addiction 

00:15:35
EVAN You wanna talk about a dead giveaway that I was addicted to pot. Well, you can look, you can look at the facts. How many hours I spend researching pot and creating arguments for pot. Ah, spend countless hours trying to convince, trying to convince my parents that weed is a good thing. 

00:15:50
Dr. Donald Misch Senior Vice-Chancellor Health and Wellness University of Colorado, Boulder 

00:15:50
DONALD MISCH The risk of becoming addicted to marijuana in general if you're a marijuana user is somewhere around 9% but if you're daily or near daily user, the risk of being addicted to marijuana is probably between 25 and 50%. 

00:16:05
TOM Marijuana was the biggest contributor to my addiction. I, ah, that's my drug of choice. Once I started smoking daily I pretty much wouldn't do anything except smoke, like that's all I wanted to do. So that's how I got into such deep depression and the loneliness because the only friend that I wanna spend time with was marijuana. 

00:16:25
Jodie Gilman Ph.D NeuroScience, Harvard/MGH Center for Addiction Medicine 

00:16:25
JODIE GILMAN Marijuana addiction look similar to a lot of other drug addictions and that you'd give up, you know, social or recreational activities to smoke marijuana. You, uhm, give up responsibilities, you give up things that you really enjoy doing to smoke marijuana and it can cause problems with friends, family, co-workers. 

00:16:50
MATT Ever since I took my first pot I basically became addicted. 

00:16:55
NIKKI The thought and the idea of going everyday without pot was unbearable. 

00:17:00
Michael O'Brien RAS, FAC, CSC pacific Addiction Center San Jose, CA 

00:17:05
MICHAEL O'BRIEN I have seen heavy marijuana users that aren't using any other substances. No alcohol, no cocaine, uhm, no cigarettes, ah, no psychiatric medications, have significant withdrawal symptoms coming off of marijuana. That often involves insomnia, significant agitation, vomiting in many cases for days, uhm, inability to eat anything, lack of appetite, uhm, and, and mostly you're just lying in bed trying to get past the withdrawal. 

00:17:35
Jared age 23, San Luis Obispo, CA 

00:17:40
JARED What makes you an addict is putting your drug use ahead of everything else in your life. I identified as an addict because when I get high that's all I, I want. I don't want anything else. 

00:17:55
Brandon Bergman PhD Clinical Psychology Addiction medicine Harvard Medical/Mass General Hospital 

00:17:55
BRANDON BERGMAN To have a marijuana used to sort of means you're marijuana use is getting in the way of your ability to function on a day to day basis. 

00:18:00
ADAM Probably addicted right off the start from it, you know, as soon as I started feeling the effects like I was like, I was totally unbored. 

00:18:10
MICHAEL O'BRIEN Over 100,000 people per year seek the treatment for marijuana addiction in the United States. 

00:18:20
BRANDON It isn't always about the way they are mo-- wanna makes you feel. It's so-- it's just that I'm so used to smoking. I'm so used to smoking. I, I feel like I didn't ca-- came out with a dependency on the habit of smoking and, you know, more than just be-- have to rely on the high of it. 

00:18:35
JOSEPH I've been smoking pot since I was 10 and literally, uhm, I don't think I've got a day, you know, except for when I was in jail locked up. 

00:18:45
Joanna Mother, Flight Attendant 

00:18:45
JOANNA It has been a struggle maintaining my job while I've tried to maintain some sanity in my life because of the destruction that my son's addiction has cause our family. People ask me do I think my son is a true addict. I mean I have friends whose kids are a map in heroin. Their behaviors are the same. The drug of choice doesn't matter. 

00:19:10
EVAN I am a pot addict. Uhm, at the time, you know, at the time I was smoking pot. There was, you know, there's all evidence in the world out there, in the internet. I could talk to you for three days by justifying why, why pot's not addictive. Uhm, for me, for me pot's addictive. 

00:19:25
MAGGIE When people say it's not addictive that really bothers me because I'm living proof that it is addictive because I did it all day everyday and if I wasn't high I couldn't fall asleep and everything wasn't good enough unless I was high. 

00:19:40
John McGuinness, Program Director, Chicago, Illinois 

00:19:40
JOHN MCGUINNESS Kids will admit that they go through physical withdrawal symptoms when they give up marijuana. We did not have this 10 years ago. We did not have complains about withdrawal symptoms physically for marijuana 10 years ago. That they get headaches, that they have blurred vision, that they get nauseated, that they have flu-like symptoms that last for a week and then it starts with morphing in to the psychological or physiological problems with the inability to sleep, the loss of concentration, the short term memory problems that they have, the inability to recognize stress, the inability to handle stress. And we get to see this severe mood swings. 

00:20:25
EVAN If you're anything like me, you can't wait till the next time you smoke. If there's smoking involved in any activity, ah, that's gonna be, that's gonna be your focus. If you smoke by yourself (inaudible ) times a day, it interferes with anything, ah, of your responsibilities that you need to do, maybe you're like me too. 

00:20:50
JACK You can get addicted to anything. You can get addicted to pornography, you can get addicted to food, you can get addicted to gambling, sex. Marijuana is no different. 

00:20:55
Dr. Donald Misch Senior Vice-Chancellor Health and Wellness University of Colorado, Boulder 

00:21:00
DONALD MISCH People who are addicted to marijuana suffer usual adverse effects of an addiction. They do have withdrawal symptoms sort, ah, very well documented. And I will tell you the treatment is not much better than it is for the treatment of alcoholism, herion addiction, cocaine addiction. Turns out marijuana addiction is tough to beat and here's why. Most of us, when we think of withdrawal from a drug we think a heroin withdrawal. When you think of all those horrible symptoms and people in awful pain and distress. The withdrawal symptoms of marijuana do have physical aspects. But in many ways, the predominance symptoms are psychological and behavioral. So your first thought is that's good news. Turns out its probably bad news. Various animal studies suggest that it's the behavioral and psychological effects of drug that may be most important than relapse. 

00:22:00
Family Tom age 13 

00:22:00
TOM So the only relationship I really kept intact was me and marijuana, really. I tre-- I treated it just like a relationship. Spent a lot of money. I, uhm, I spent a lot of time with marijuana, I, uhm, I spent a lot of emotional energy into marijuana. 

00:22:20
JACK My relationships completely fell apart. Uhm, my relationship with my mother who I was always very close to was based completely on lies. 

00:22:30
Maggie age 18 

00:22:30
MAGGIE For a while I think it was kind of a joke in my family actually but then everyone started to see how negatively it was affecting me and then in turn affecting them because I was not mentally stable and I would go off on them and throw things and break things. And there was always that wonder in parents' mind like, is she gonna come home on time? Is she gonna get arrested tonight? It she gonna, you know, be alive tomorrow? 

00:22:55
Carlos age 37 

00:22:55
CARLOS Disappointment, I see in my mom's face when I-- she'd come to visit me when I was incarcerated. For me hurts a lot but the most damaging of all was the fracturing of, of my relationship between my daughter and I, you know, I wa-- I walk-- basically walk out on my children because of my drug addiction. And, ah, it's hard to forgive yourself for something like that. But, you know, in your drug use, you, you don't care who gets hurt. 

00:23:30
JOANNA You know, we see a child who, uhm, is lazy, lethargic, ah, didn't care, belligerent, he swears, he's violent and crazy. Like we have holes in our walls where he's banged his head into the wall. 

00:23:45
John McGuinness, Program Director, Chicago, Illinois 

00:23:45
JOHN MCGUINNESS They're-- are used to being verbally abusive to their parents and we see more kids where they get physical. Ah, throwing things at home and eventually that leads to punching walls which then leads to pushing mom and then leads to rotting away and then it, it leads to physical aggression on siblings especially if, if they're younger. All these is from marijuana. 

00:24:15
School 

00:24:20
MIKE I was at lunch, uhm, with friends and we all got really stoned and I went back to school and I went into my 5th grade, ah, poetry class. and the bell rang and I guess I became kind of catatonic. Uhm, the teacher, ah, called roll and I couldn't say anything. I just sat there. 

00:24:45
[sil.] 

00:24:50
MIKE Uhm, I don't think they knew what to do, uhm, and the teacher just sort of let it go and the other student were looking at me and they went on with the class. I realized that, yeah, that afternoon when I, when I sobered up that this was having a pretty bad effect on me. 

00:25:10
TOM I was diagnosed by ADHD when I was younger but then once I started using, it didn't help because my, my attention worse, my motivation was bad. I, uhm, suffered from bad grades, not going to school. 

00:25:25
CARLOS After my 16th birthday, uhm, I could say that I was honestly using marijuana on an almost every other day, daily basis. You know, skipping school and, uhm, smoking pot before school and basically, you know, my desire to make good grades had just declined. 

00:25:50
JOANNA Some of the problems that we were seeing early on or that his grades were dropping, we were getting calls from his school saying that he was not attending classes, he was caught smoking cigarettes behind the school and then there was a series of stealing. 

00:26:05
Erica age 17 

00:26:10
ERICA Smoking marijuana affected my school life. I almost failed a bunch of my classes in the second half of freshmen year just cuz I didn't care or like I wouldn't show up the class or I'd be too high to focus on anything during class. 

00:26:25
ADAM I couldn't function right without weed so I had to smoke weed before I went to football practice. And if we had doubles or we had 6 hour practices I had to smoke more weed so I'd have the longer high time until I got home to go smoke weed. 

00:26:40
Colin age 16 

00:26:45
COLIN My grades went downhill cuz I al-- all I was focused on was, you know, my next high and my grades just plummeted. I, I failed classes for the first time. I've never failed a class before. I think I failed all of my classes that year cuz I was just focused on weed and it's terrible but I can't go back and change that. I wish I had made some different decisions but, you know, I, I didn't. 

00:27:10
Evan age 24 

00:27:10
EVAN When I got to college and made the horrific realization that, ah, weed dictated my life. It dictated who I trusted, who I hung out with what I do when I'm not in class, whether or not I go to class. 

00:27:25
Financial Effects 

00:27:30
CARLOS The amount of money that I've spent on marijuana, I, I can't even begin to, to guess. It has to be more than 60,000 dollars at least, you know, and me saying that out loud really hits home because, uhm, that's money that I've taken away from my children. That money that I've taken away from my life, you know. Not counting the time that I've spend in prison. The, the money I could have been making rather than sitting in prison making ¢8 an hour. I could have been out working, making a living. 

00:28:05
ADAM My, ah, dad was giving me money everyday to go buy weed. I told him that I was, ah, that I was just gonna get food and whatever. I, I started to just like that was my excuse and after a while it wasn't cutting it so I had to start robbing people for weed and I had to jump multiple people for weed. Ah, I can't tell you how many people I stole from and the people that I've hurt throughout just trying to get weed. 

00:28:30
BRANDON Me personally, we just me-- manage it, my weed smoking habits. I was asked about like, maybe a hundred or more-- probably a week. 

00:28:40
JAMES I spent on marijuana, not on hard core drugs, not on anything else but on marijuana at least $500,000 plus over the eight, nine, 10 years that I smoked. That's a house. It's up in smoke literally. 

00:29:05
NIKKI Much money I was spending on it, a lot. I was buying it by the pound. 

00:29:10
MATT Anywhere from a hundred dollars above, $400. I mean, as a kid that's where it all went. I can, uhm, living probably a very nice comfortable life right now if I put all that in there in retirement fund. 

00:29:30
TOM Spent, uhm, $1,500 of my, my mom's money, uhm, into my addictions on drugs for somebody who was 13-years-old. That's, that's a lot of money.

It's "Just" Pot Matthew Landstrom Psy.D Neuro Psychologist Chicago, IL 

00:29:45
MATTHEW LANDSTROM I get why people think it's just marijuana because it's so subtle and it adds up over time. Ah, I think of people who work out or who, you know, pizza who, you know, pizza right? If you eat a pizza one day you don't notice a difference on your weight. Ah, if you work out on one day, you're not gonna notice any difference but if you work out or 6 months or eat a pizza everyday for 6 months and look back, you're going to see a huge difference and that's what's happening in marijuana use and because you don't notice it because it's so subtle on a day to day basis, ah, it's hard for people to perceive them. 

00:30:20
MAGGIE When someone says, "it's just pots" before I got sober I would've probably agreed but now, uhm, going from one end of the spectrum to the other I really see its negative effects.

00:30:35
IAN PARKINSON I think we dismiss marijuana as the, ah, non-harmful, you know, kind of mellow drug and, and in reality now we're seeing all these, ah, cases of, of either violence or, you know, uhm, mental illness. Now is it causing a mental illness or is it, you know, is it bringing it out? I don't know. We've obviously seen some increase yet again, changes. And you're talking about 12, 13, 14-year-old, uhm, were, were exposing into something that's very damaging the-- them for the rest of their lives. 

00:31:10
JOANNA Well, when someone says to me it's just marijuana I, I mean, I-- it's like I almost can't answer. I-- it's almost like I'm dumbfounded because I know done to my life. Its destroyed its-- I moved out of my home, ah, with my husband and we separated for a year and a half. Our daughters don't talk to, to, to their brother. It has-- it, it's just a disease or my son, it's a family disease.

00:31:35
BRAD RUDD If someone says it's just pot to me when it's a parent or whether it's someone that's the direct user, in some cases both, ah, all I could do is, is invite them to look at the research. There's a lot of really solid data on the deleterious effects of THC. 

00:31:50
CARLOS To me, now I see the effects of it, the loss of long term memory. I have long term memory loss and, and that-- there is direct result from the use of marijuana at early age. Uhm, I would say now, don't be so naive. Early marijuana use does have an effect on you that bring... 

00:32:10
NIKKI When somebody's says it's just pot I get really sad because I know what they're saying is that it's just denial.

LESLIE O'CONNOR Our students taught the mental dangers of marijuana use-- I, I don't believe so. I, I think it comes back to this cultural acceptance, ah, where its viewed that it's just pot. It's not that bad. I t's not like I'm snorting cocaine or it's not like that, I mean, like herion. Brain research has shown that, that students under the influence of marijuana-- that chemical intake into the body especially at a young age, whether it be 14, 15, 16 has to have an effect on the brain and that impact may be years down the line or it may be a situation where it impacts them greatly right there and then. 

00:33:05
BRANDON BERGMAN One of the myths, right, is that marijuana is the least harmful of the, the drugs. 

00:33:15
CALLIE If somebody said it's just pot, uhm, I would respond with just because poison Ivy is a plant just like other plants doesn't mean you want to roll in it. 

00:33:25
UNKNOWN Well, I always hear the same thing. It's just pot, what's the big deal? Just get off my back. This isn't just pot. Research time and time again especially in the, in the last few years has definitely shown it impacts your brain, it changes your personality, it changes the testosterone in your system, it gets down into your semen if you're a boy.

00:33:50
KENNETH DUCKWORTH Many families have come to NAMI and have wondered could the marijuana have been related to their symptoms of now schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. The answer is yes but it's hard to prove that it was the existent risk for your son or daughter. What we do know is that people are taking a risk and this is a risk that is an unnecessary risk. And so when teenagers are weighing how much do I wanna fit in, how much do I wanna belong, it should also be weighing what am I doing to my brain?
