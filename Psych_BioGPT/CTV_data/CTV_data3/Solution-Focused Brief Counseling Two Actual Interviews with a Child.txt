DR. GERALD SKLARE Big, big difference, once this miracle happened, the teachers would notice you were there. (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
KELLY Uh hmm. They'll get more work, (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
DR. GERALD SKLARE Uh hmm. 

00:16:05
KELLY better work. 

00:16:05
DR. GERALD SKLARE Okay. Teachers, ah. 

00:16:10
KELLY I only have one teacher. 

00:16:10
DR. GERALD SKLARE Teacher. Okay. All right. (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
KELLY 'Coz there's only one fourth grade class in a (inaudible ). 

00:16:16
DR. GERALD SKLARE Okay. What the teacher would notice that you'd be doing more work, is that you're saying? 

00:16:20
KELLY Yeah. 

00:16:20
DR. GERALD SKLARE And? 

00:16:20
KELLY Not just daydreaming about what's gonna happen or something. 

00:16:25
DR. GERALD SKLARE  Okay. So- 

00:16:30
Reframing from the absence of something to the presence of something 

00:16:30
DR. GERALD SKLARE - instead of daydreaming, what would they see you do? 

00:16:30
KELLY They see me doing work, working hard, doing better. 

00:16:35
DR. GERALD SKLARE How would they know you're working hard and how would they know you're doing better? 

00:16:35
KELLY  Well, they'd, (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
DR. GERALD SKLARE What, what would they, what would they say that? 

00:16:40
KELLY they know I'd be working hard if I get 100 percent on my spelling test. And, uhm they'll uhm, I'd be working hard if I learn how to write in cursive a little bit. 

00:16:55
DR. GERALD SKLARE What else? 

00:16:55
KELLY Uhm, writing more notes like, we're writing, like, stories and plays and stuff. And like, we did a little play about a day in the life of a pilgrim. (crosstalk) 

00:17:10
DR. GERALD SKLARE Uh-huh. 

00:17:10
KELLY That was for homework and I didn't do it so I had to stay in and then do it. But I didn't get that, I try to do uhm, as much as I could and it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. And if I did it like over again I'm like do better and they might go, "Wow, Kelly's doing much better on his, all of his other stuff." (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
DR. GERALD SKLARE Oh, so you may do it, you may do it so if, (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
KELLY Better. 

00:17:35
DR. GERALD SKLARE if you did it better, if you did it over again, writing on your notes, okay, and if you did it better and what is it gonna take to get it better, what do you have to do to make it better? 

00:17:45
KELLY Work hard. 

00:17:45
DR. GERALD SKLARE Okay. And what, what does that look like if you're working hard? 

00:17:45
Detailing specific behaviors 

00:17:45
DR. GERALD SKLARE What would we see? What would I see if I was looking through your wind, you have a window on your door? (crosstalk) 

00:17:50
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:17:50
DR. GERALD SKLARE What would, what would I see that would be different? (crosstalk) 

00:17:50
KELLY  You see me, you see me studying instead of watching TV all night. 

00:17:55
DR. GERALD SKLARE  Oh, okay. 

00:18:00
KELLY But mostly I watch TV 'coz I like all these other shows. 

00:18:05
[sil.] 

00:18:05
DR. GERALD SKLARE  Okay, so in other words there'll be less TV time and more... (crosstalk) 

00:18:15
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:18:15
DR. GERALD SKLARE ...study time, is that what you're saying? (crosstalk)

DR. GERALD SKLARE Just during school? 

00:18:25
KELLY Sometimes, just. (crosstalk) 

00:18:25
DR. GERALD SKLARE You don't do it at home? (crosstalk) 

00:18:25
KELLY Just a couple of times at home, I did it. 

00:18:30
DR. GERALD SKLARE Oh, you did? Really? 

00:18:30
KELLY Just a couple of times. 

00:18:30
DR. GERALD SKLARE So, I'd be seeing you do it some more at home. (crosstalk) 

00:18:35
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:18:35
DR. GERALD SKLARE You'd be doing some, I'd be actually seeing you, you know, (crosstalk)

DR. GERALD SKLARE Okay. 

00:18:45
KELLY Homework every night except Saturday and Sunday. 

00:18:50
DR. GERALD SKLARE Except for the weekends. Okay. So instead of those weekends, you'd be doing your homework. (crosstalk) 

00:18:55
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:18:55
DR. GERALD SKLARE You'd be doing schoolwork? 

00:18:55
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:18:55
DR. GERALD SKLARE I'd, I'd be seeing that. That would tell me, that that would tell the teachers, "Hey, Kelly is really not worrying about this and he's really taking it and then turn around." 

00:19:05
KELLY Yeah. 

00:19:05
DR. GERALD SKLARE Okay. Okay. All right. Uhm, I guess- 

00:19:10
Detailing specific behaviors 

00:19:10

00:19:10
KELLY Yeah. 

00:19:10

00:19:15
KELLY Work. 

00:19:15
DR. GERALD SKLARE to work, huh. Hmm. What would that look like if you were doing that work? 

00:19:20
KELLY Yeah. 

00:19:20
DR. GERALD SKLARE And how, how, if I was to take a picture of you studying, ca, can you, can you, can you, if you will close, if you close your eyes. Okay, close your eyes. Can you, can you picture yourself studying instead of watching TV? (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:19:35
DR. GERALD SKLARE Can you picture that? 

00:19:35
KELLY  Uh hmm. 

00:19:40
DR. GERALD SKLARE Now, I like you to tell me what that picture looks like? 

00:19:40
KELLY  I'm lying on my bed, 

00:19:45
DR. GERALD SKLARE Okay. 

00:19:45
KELLY you know, got all these father's at work and finishing and stuff. And I'm writing lots of stuff or work and extra credit. Ah, I'm not watching TV, just lying there and doing work. 

00:20:10
DR. GERALD SKLARE  Okay, okay. Open your eyes. That's the picture. 

00:20:20
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:20:20
DR. GERALD SKLARE So you'd be in your bedroom, right? Lying on your bed... 

00:20:25
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:20:25
DR. GERALD SKLARE ...and writing. Having folders... 

00:20:25
KELLY Yeah. 

00:20:25
DR. GERALD SKLARE ...around you and from those folders, you'd be actually writing stuff down. (crosstalk) 

00:20:30
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:20:30
DR. GERALD SKLARE That's what it would look like. 

00:20:30
KELLY  Yeah, studying. 

00:20:35
DR. GERALD SKLARE Studying. 

00:20:35
KELLY Other stuff. 

00:20:35
DR. GERALD SKLARE Instead. (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
KELLY And there's like an old dictionary type folder I got right to the next to my bed. 

00:20:40
DR. GERALD SKLARE  And then your teachers would see you're getting more work done. 

00:20:45
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:20:45
DR. GERALD SKLARE You'd be doing, yours, you'd be getting 100 on the spelling test. If they saw that, they'd say, "Aha! Something's going on." They would, ah, they would, you'd be also doing better writing cursive. (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:20:55
DR. GERALD SKLARE I see. Ah, you'd be writing more notes. 

00:20:55
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:20:55
DR. GERALD SKLARE  You'd be studying instead of watching TV and that would look like you lying on your bed, with folders around, dictionary by your side, and you'd be writing for extra credit. 

00:21:05
KELLY  Uh hmm. 

00:21:10
DR. GERALD SKLARE Uhm, and then you put your hamster in the other room at night so it wouldn't wake you up. 

00:21:15
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:21:15
DR. GERALD SKLARE Those are the kinds of things that would tell you, "Hey, I'm off of this worry stuff. I'm not doing that. I'm, I'm getting myself in control of myself." That's what like? 

00:21:25
KELLY Together. 

00:21:25
DR. GERALD SKLARE Yeah. 

00:21:25
Step 3: Instances of Success/Exceptions Questions 

00:21:25
DR. GERALD SKLARE  Tell me about some times when some of this is already happening. 

00:21:35
KELLY That's another tough... (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
DR. GERALD SKLARE Uh hmm. 

00:21:40
KELLY ...one. The question was? 

00:21:40
DR. GERALD SKLARE  How, how about the times when you're able and this miracle is happening for you and you're not, you know, thinking about. 

00:21:50
KELLY I'm not thinking about it? 

00:21:55
DR. GERALD SKLARE Not, not thinking about it. When, when are you able to not worry or not be scared? 

00:21:55
KELLY Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
DR. GERALD SKLARE  Tell me about, tell me about some time when you're not so, not, not really relaxing(ph)? (crosstalk) 

00:22:00
KELLY Well, uhm, hmm, there's a couple of times during school, and then during the night. 

00:22:05
DR. GERALD SKLARE  Tell me about- 

00:22:10
Identifying exceptions 

00:22:10
DR. GERALD SKLARE - the times in school where you're able to get those thoughts out of your head. 

00:22:10
KELLY Well, it was like, before, before Christmas, it was nothing happened and it was all good and happy and stuff, nothing was happening. 

00:22:25
DR. GERALD SKLARE How about after Christmas- 

00:22:25
Redirecting to solutions during problem times 

00:22:25
DR. GERALD SKLARE - when it's, after it starts, started happening? Tell me about some times when you were able to say, "I'm not gonna think of that." 

00:22:30
KELLY Uh hmm. It was one night and. (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
DR. GERALD SKLARE You mean, you was, you was able to think about some of these things. 

00:22:40
KELLY Yeah. There's one night and I woke up and then I got scared 'coz I heard that motor or something. I just got up and I thought, "This isn't worth it." So I just went back down, closed my eyes and wait, and I fell asleep. 

00:23:00
DR. GERALD SKLARE You did that? 

00:23:00
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:23:00
DR. GERALD SKLARE You were able to say it isn't worth it? 

00:23:05
KELLY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
DR. GERALD SKLARE Inside your head? 

00:23:05
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:23:05
DR. GERALD SKLARE And it stopped it? 

00:23:05
KELLY  Uh hmm. 

00:23:10
DR. GERALD SKLARE You were able to do that? 

00:23:10
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:23:10
DR. GERALD SKLARE That's amazing. 

00:23:15
Cheerleading 

00:23:15
KELLY It's not only once that happened though. 

00:23:15
Mindmapping 

00:23:15
DR. GERALD SKLARE Yeah. But it happened. It isn't worth it. 

00:23:25
[sil.] 

00:23:25
DR. GERALD SKLARE  You told yourself that? 

00:23:30
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:23:30
DR. GERALD SKLARE  And it stopped? 

00:23:35
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:23:35
DR. GERALD SKLARE How'd you do it? How'd you do it? (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
KELLY Uhm, I just, I just wake up and I just said, "It's, it's not worth it," just to get out of bed and run into my dad room and wake him up. Well, while I could just be sleeping. So I just said, "It's not worth it. Don't wake everybody up," so I just went back to sleep. 

00:23:55
DR. GERALD SKLARE You know what,- 

00:23:55
Reinforcing mindmapping and cheerleading 

00:23:55
DR. GERALD SKLARE - what's amazing about that? Why don't you think about this for a minute. What's amazing about that is we had all these things going on. It would be so much easier for you to stop worrying and start getting scared. Right? (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:24:10
DR. GERALD SKLARE And you decided, I'm not gon, I'm gonna take the tough road. And the tough road is, I'm gonna not let those things scare me. And I'm gonna say to myself, it isn't worth it, which tells me that you can be strong when you need to be. That's what it tells me? 

00:24:30
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:24:30
DR. GERALD SKLARE And you did it. You did it, during the night. That's neat. That's neat that you're able to do that. How about some other- 

00:24:40
Identifying additional problem exceptions or instances of success 

00:24:40
DR. GERALD SKLARE - times when that, when you're able to stop thinking those thoughts? 

00:24:45
KELLY Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:24:45
DR. GERALD SKLARE How about at school, can you think of sometimes at school? 

00:24:45
KELLY  Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:24:50
DR. GERALD SKLARE Sometime at school were you're able to, well, instead of daydreaming and not focusing and, and, or maybe starting to think about that were you able to (inaudible )? (crosstalk) 

00:24:57
KELLY It was this year, and we just started school before Christmas and I was just focusing 'coz I mean nothing was gonna happen and like then like something happened that I don't, that I didn't know about or something like that. I don't remember what it was. And I thought(ph), "Well I'm not worrying about this 'coz it's just nothing. It's just nothing and I shouldn't worry about this 'coz I know that they're gonna take good care of 'em." So, I stopped worrying about it. 

00:25:35
GERALD SKLARE Oh, I, I gotta write that down. So you said to yourself, "Why worry about it, 

00:25:40
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:45
GERALD SKLARE  because they will be taken care of," right? 

00:25:50
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
KELLY It will be taken care of like that. 

00:25:55
[sil.] 

00:25:55
GERALD SKLARE  And you were able to do that? 

00:26:00
KELLY  Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
GERALD SKLARE And then refocus on school. 

00:26:05
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:26:05
GERALD SKLARE  How'd you do that? 

00:26:10
Mindmapping 

00:26:10
GERALD SKLARE How'd you make yourself? 

00:26:10
KELLY It just happened. 

00:26:10
GERALD SKLARE I think. No, I don't think so. (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
Getting student to accept ownership 

00:26:10
KELLY  Sometimes. (crosstalk) 

00:26:15
GERALD SKLARE Could, could, because what you're saying to me Kelly is most of the time that doesn't happen but some, but this time it did, right? 

00:26:20
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:26:20
GERALD SKLARE So what was different about this time? What made it different? 

00:26:20
KELLY  Well, honestly, it did feel good when I just didn't think about it and stuff. 

00:26:25
GERALD SKLARE  Uh-huh 

00:26:30
KELLY And then, like, it's a little toughie again. 

00:26:35
GERALD SKLARE Yeah? 

00:26:35
KELLY And, what was the question? I forgot. 

00:26:40
GERALD SKLARE The question was it was different. 

00:26:40
KELLY I think that's too. (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
GERALD SKLARE It was different. What made it different this time because my guess is sometimes, you know, you, you got worried and you get scared. 

00:26:50
KELLY And sometimes I don't. 

00:26:50
Accepting ownership for mindmapping solutions 

00:26:50
GERALD SKLARE And, and then when you didn't, when you told yourself, "Why worry about it because they'll be taken care of." 

00:26:55
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:26:55
GERALD SKLARE  How did you make that thought come into your head this time 'coz that's different? 

00:27:00
KELLY Well, maybe I thought coming in my head because since nothing's been happening. Like back when I was little, nothing's been happening, why should I worry about it now? Like, if something happened when I was little and now I'm older, why should I worry about it now and now? But if I know it's gonna be taken care of then I don't have to worry about it. That's how could it be. (crosstalk) 

00:27:25
GERALD SKLARE Oh, Okay. I see, I see. Okay. 

00:27:30
Cheerleading 

00:27:30
GERALD SKLARE Hmm, so you have some real uhm, good skills. 

00:27:35
KELLY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
GERALD SKLARE Where d'you learn that? 

00:27:35
KELLY  Hmm. (laughs) 

00:27:40
GERALD SKLARE Where did you learn how to do that? 

00:27:40
KELLY I don't know. (laughs) 

00:27:40
GERALD SKLARE  You don't know? 

00:27:45
KELLY No. 

00:27:45
GERALD SKLARE But you, but you lo, but you do it. 

00:27:45
KELLY Yeah. I just do it. 

00:27:50
GERALD SKLARE Yeah. But you know that takes uhm, some special talent to be able to do that. You know it does. Knowing all those stuff that, all the things that are going on... (crosstalk) 

00:28:00
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:28:00
GERALD SKLARE ...for you to say I'm gonna put this aside and I'm gonna leave it. I'm just gonna... (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
KELLY I just did that. 

00:28:05
GERALD SKLARE ...think those, think those positive thoughts. And, and think about the, these nice things. 

00:28:10
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:28:10
GERALD SKLARE You're gonna be taken care of and I'm gonna be concentrating on these other things. (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
KELLY  Uh hmm. 

00:28:15
GERALD SKLARE You know, you know, that's, that takes some special skills, How d'you, how d'you figure that out? Did you learn that? Did you read about that somewhere? 

00:28:20
KELLY  Maybe, I (laughs) think. 

00:28:25
GERALD SKLARE Did your mom or dad teach you that? Did your teacher? 

00:28:25
KELLY Uhm, I don't know. (laughs) 

00:28:30
GERALD SKLARE You don't, you know you got it though, right? 

00:28:30
KELLY Yeah. I know I got it. 

00:28:35
Step 4: Scaling 

00:28:35
GERALD SKLARE  Hmm. That takes a special person to be able to figure that kind of stuff out. Someone's pretty smart, what tells me. Another question. With a scale uhm, uhm, ah, you know, a scale from, from 0 to 10, 0 to 10. 

00:29:00
KELLY  Uh hmm 

00:29:05
GERALD SKLARE And 10 is that you're never wor, not worrying anymore... (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
GERALD SKLARE ...even though these things are happening. (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
GERALD SKLARE You're not worrying and you're taking care of yourself. (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
GERALD SKLARE  You're gonna say, "I'm not gonna worry 'coz I know if I worry, it's gonna not be good for me. It's not gonna be good for my mom. It's not gonna be good for my dad, not gonna be good for my teachers in school because I'm not doing my work." And none of that, don't worry, it doesn't get in your head at all. 

00:29:25
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
GERALD SKLARE It's just gone because it's, it's the day after the miracle, okay? And that 0 is the worst. This is 0. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
KELLY This is when I'm thinking about it and. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
GERALD SKLARE All the time. (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
KELLY Time. 

00:29:40
GERALD SKLARE Every moment during when you're dreaming about it, you're thinking about it. I mean, in school, you get, you can't concentrate, you can't play with your friends, you can't do anything. You aren't going to Huber's, you're just so down about it, 

00:29:50
KELLY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:29:50
GERALD SKLARE that it's just got you, just, it's got you, (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
KELLY You're fallen. 

00:29:55
GERALD SKLARE go, it's got to, it's got you all the time. (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
KELLY Yeah. 

00:29:55
GERALD SKLARE I mean, you can't. Now, where are you right now? 

00:30:00
KELLY Uhm, maybe I'm around 5. (laughs) 

00:30:05
GERALD SKLARE Is that right? You're at 5? 

00:30:05
KELLY Maybe 7, I don't know. 

00:30:10
GERALD SKLARE 5 or is it, what do you think it is? 5, 6 or 7? What do you think it is? 

00:30:10
KELLY  Maybe 6, probably. Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:30:15
GERALD SKLARE Six. 

00:30:15
Assessing scaling rating 

00:30:15

00:53:10
GERALD SKLARE  Okay. 

00:53:15
KELLY Way up there. 

00:53:15
Detailing specific behaviors 

00:53:15
GERALD SKLARE Okay. And give me an example of what you mean? What would you see yourself doing where you'd say, "I am here, I am a 10?" What would you be doing that would tell you, "I know I'm at a 10, if I'm doing this?" 

00:53:30
KELLY  (laughs) Tough. Uhm, I know I'm at a 10 if I'm, uhm, if I'm at, I'm at, Oh, sometimes like I get bored or something during playtime. When we go outside and play sometimes, I will be staying. So I'll bring uhm, like something to read. Well, that's sort of, uhm, I'll be at a 10 when doing a lot more stuff than I'm doing now. And I'm doing all this other stuff, more stuff than I am now. Just. (crosstalk) 

00:54:25
GERALD SKLARE Okay. And what would, what, what would one of those stuffs be?

00:55:00
GERALD SKLARE Okay. 

00:55:00
Detailing specific behaviors 

00:55:00
GERALD SKLARE You keep progressing like you have been progressing? 

00:55:05
KELLY Uh hmm. 

00:55:05
GERALD SKLARE Will you be satisfied with the counseling that we're, yeah, we're doing here?

00:55:05
Step 4: Concluding The Session and Providing A Message 

00:55:05
GERALD SKLARE  I gonna read you a message. You are indeed an amazing young man, making a miracle come true. I mean, that takes a lot of hard work. And you did. (crosstalk) 

00:55:25
KELLY And courage. 

00:55:25
GERALD SKLARE And courage, yes. Work and courage. Uhm, your teacher has been happy with the new Kelly, who is now focused on work rather than take, talking, goofing around and acting silly, beginning to focus. And this led her being a lot happier with you and uhm, not calling your name like she was before. Ah, do you really like the results of this, of your new behavior? And. (crosstalk) 

00:55:50
KELLY Yeah. 

00:55:50
GERALD SKLARE You really like it. You know, in this, 'coz you know that you can do it. You proved to yourself you can do it. Being able to sleep through the night at your dad's. Picking out your clothes the night before and laying them out, forgetting about bad things and replacing them with happy thoughts show that you have what it takes to make good things happen for yourself and reaching a 9. Because of your desire to do better in school and at home, I want you to continue doing, what you've been doing that has been working for you that will get you to a 10. Keep it up! 

00:56:20
KELLY Okay. 

00:56:20
GERALD SKLARE  Okay. 'Coz I think you're headed right there. (crosstalk)
