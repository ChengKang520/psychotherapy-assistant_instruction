Neurobiology and Narrative Therapy Therapeutic practices for lasting changes with Marie-Nathalie Beaudoin, Ph.D. 

00:00:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hi, I'm Marie-Nathalie Beaudoin and today I will talk about neuro-biology and therapy. 

00:00:35
Marie-Nathalie Beaudoin, Ph.D. 

00:00:35
MARIE There has been so many exciting discoveries and findings in neuroscience and brain research to last you decades, that it's fascinating to examine how these apply to the therapeutic conversations we have with clients. How is it for example that we can make changes that we see in therapy stick in clients mind and be helpful in everyday lives. How is it that we can improve our therapeutic work with people to make sure that it is really helpful. This video will attempt to examine some of these ideas and the practice that can follow in our therapeutic work. 

00:01:15
Demonstration of Practice 

00:01:15
MARIE And finally I will have an interview, with a client and we can look at the implication of these findings in brain research and therapeutic conversations. 

00:01:25
Brain Research Neuroplasticity 

00:01:25
MARIE We will start by examining some of the recent brain research and see why there is such a hype about brain research. Then we'll define neuroplasticity and we'll look at basic brain concepts. We'll look at the brain structurally and we'll look at the brain at the cellular level. After that we'll have a playful brain structure demonstration to help everyone remember some of these hard core concepts. 

00:01:55
Revolutionary Discoveries Invention of the functional MRI Neuroplasticity Meditation changes the brain 

00:01:55
MARIE So let's look at the revolutionary discoveries. The last 20 years have been incredible. Mainly because of the invention of the functional MRI in the early 1990s. The F-MRI allows us to see what happens in the brain while it is performing a task. This has allowed scientists to do a number of amazing experiment. One experiment that really-really drew a lot of the scientific interest was a study done by Lazar and colleagues in 2005, which showed that the brainge, the brain can change dramatically. Just eight weeks of mindfulness meditation performed everyday in a group of participant, allowed their cortical thickness to increase. Now this was a landmark discovery. Because it showed that what we do can change our brain. It's allowed scientist to have a proof in some ways of the neuroplasticity that people have been wondering about for a century. 

00:03:10
New understandings The brain changes constantly: It shapes, and is shaped, by experience 

00:03:10
MARIE We now have new understandings, the brain changes constantly. It shapes, and is shaped by experience. It is a bi-directional process. 

00:03:25
Neuroplasticity Occurs in newer and more complex areas of the brain Older areas of the brain such as the brain stem are less plastic 

00:03:25
MARIE This neuroplasticity however, occurs in newer and more complex area of the brain. It doesn't happen in older areas of the brain such as the brain stem for example, which is less plastic. The brain stem is primarily responsible for some survival mechanisms such as blood pressure, heart rate, temperature. 

00:03:45
Basic Structure of the brain Reptilian Brain Limbic System Neocortex 

00:03:50
MARIE It would be very inconvenient if the brain stem was to be plastic. You have the lower level of the brain which is the reptilian brain, which is the brain stem which again control uh... blood pressure and heart rate. Then in the middle you have the limbic system, which is also called the mammalian brain or the emotional brain. And then on top you have the neo-cortex, which is newer in terms of history and the development of our specie. The neo-cortex is slower to respond, while the emotional brain is very fast to respond. 

00:04:25
Cortex and limbic system 

00:04:30
MARIE The neo-cortex is strategically positioned on top of the limbic system because it is supposed to regulate its intense emotions. The limbic system develops at a very young age and is very-very fast to respond to situations. While the neo-cortex analysis things. It takes in consideration multiple factors, it's involved in reasoning and um... pulling out some memories of knowledge and it is much slower to respond. A nice way of remembering these three concepts is to use Daniel Seagulls handy brain model. Essentially you would take your right hand and the bottom of your right hand would be the brain stem, also called the reptilian brain. And then on top of that you put your thumb, which can represent the limbic system or the emotional brain or also called the mammalian brain. And then when you fold your fingers, you have the neo-cortex. And the neo-cortex is well positioned to regulate the emotional brain. Unfortunately the emotional brain is very-very fast and for survival purposes tend to allow us to react very quickly to situations, while the neo-cortex which is supposed to regulate the emotional brain tends to react slowly. It tends to analyse facts, remember information, consider consequences and it involves in a thinking that is much slower. For that reason sometimes we react quicker than we anticipated to a situation. I like to think of the neo-cortex as being a tool of wisdom that life gives us a little too late sometimes, or a saying that I like to remember is that, 'wisdom is a calm that life gives you when you've lost all your hair'. 

00:06:35
Two hemispheres LEFT Logic, Linear, Linguistic, Lists, Literal, Late development RIGHT Images, Sensations, Spatial information, Metaphor 

00:06:35
MARIE The left hemisphere is involved in processing logic, linear, linguistic information, it's involved in making lists and literal thinking and tends to develop a little later. The right hemisphere is involved in processing images, sensations, spatial information and metaphor. It's also involved in auto-biographical memories. 

00:07:00
Left & Right Hemisphere 

00:07:05
MARIE Here is a nice illustration of how each hemisphere tends to process the information. 

00:07:05
Basic Neuroscience: Cellular Neurons Connections between neurons forms complex neural-networks Neuron that fire together, Wire together 

00:07:10
MARIE Let us now move to some of the basic neuroscience concept at the cellular level. Brain cells are called neurons and they're held together by glia, glia like glue. 

00:07:25
Neurons Dendrites, Axon, &Cell Body 

00:07:25
MARIE The connection between neurons forms complex neural-network. 

00:07:30
Basic Neuroscience: Cellular Neurons Connections between neurons forms complex neural-networks Neuron that fire together, Wire together 

00:07:30
MARIE Some of you may have heard the famous quote by Donald Head, 'Neuron that fire together, wire together', so when two experiences triggered at the same time, the neurons in our head will wire them together in some ways. 

00:07:45
Neurons Dendrites, Axon, &Cell Body 

00:07:50
MARIE You have here an illustration of these neurons and their connection. The signals can be triggered by the cell body and moved down the axon which will release neural-transmitters which will activate the next neuron. These neurons can transmit impulse at 2500 impulses per second. I will now do a playful demonstration with a live brain to help you remember some of these concepts. Thank you Chris for accepting to volunteer your brain for this demonstration, I really appreciate. So we have here a nice brain specimen which is enclosed in the skull. And we have a frontal lobe here which is involved in analytical thinking and reasoning and also in motor control. We have the Parietal lobe which is involved in many-many functions including where we are in space and touch and pain, all of those sensations and movement of the body. And we have the temporal lobe which is involved in [inaudible] processing and under which there is the memory [inaudible] of course in human life. And in the back you have the Occipital lobe, which is the main processing centre for visual information. Interestingly the new neuroscience of finding has shown that if ever Chris was to become blind all the cells in the Occipital lobe and usually processing visual information would be recruited to process more auditory information or touch. They would be recruited to another, to do another task. So the brain also has two hemispheres, so we have here the left hemisphere, which is involved in liner thinking processing of information, analytical thinking or reasoning um... binary responses such as yes no. Uh... its really more hard core judgement and deduction thinking, while on the right side we have more of a romantic kind of a brain whose uh... involved in affect, in attachment, in metaphors, in images, ah... creativity and intuition is generally believed to take part in the right hemisphere. Now the two hemispheres are connected by the corpus callosum, which runs right here in the middle, and allows for communication between the two hemispheres. Of course in neural science and in psychotherapy the ideal and healthiest way of being is when the two hemispheres are integrated in their processing of information. So that's often perceived as a goal in therapeutic conversations. So now we're going to proceed to the internal structures of the brain and in order to do that, it would be helpful for me if I could shave a little area here behind here Chris, is that ok? Yeah, okay, alright, so let me shave a little bit here. Okay I have a nice um... a nice wide area here from which I can pull some brain structures, so I will take my tweezer and uh... attempt to remove something. Let's see what comes out. The first thing that comes out hmm let's see what is this? This looks like spider webs. Hav-have you been on a vacation lately Chris? Yeah. Hmm interesting. Alright now let's look at what we can find more interesting. Okay, I have here an amygdala. And the amygdala is really key in the emotion processing in the brain. 

00:11:35
Amygdala 

00:11:35
MARIE The amygdala is associated with fight, flight and freeze responses. So it's one of the first place in the brain that determines that whether what's happening is safe or not. Uh... the amygdala is so important in processing what is called negative emotion, that when it's being removed in animal studies, such as bob cats and also called lynx, these animals become unable to defend themselves or protect their food in anyway. So the amygdala is-is really key in-in determining our safety. That's why sometimes I struggle with calling them negative emotions, because really there's a place for all of the emotions, but in neuroscience terms, negative emotions are processed in a different place in the brain than positive emotion, which is why the distinction exists. Okay I'm pulling another structure here, let's see what it is, it's coming out, okay it's the hippocampus. 

00:12:35
Hippocampus 

00:12:35
MARIE The hippocampus is at the end of the amygdala of the brain. You have two amygdala in the brain and we have the hippocampus in the middle and the hippocampus is heavily involved in processing memories. Most people think that memories are just a video tape that we have in our brains of our life events. It's really not the case, the memories that we have in the brains are reconstructions and it's the hippocampus who is in charge of reconstructing all those different pieces of the puzzles. You know so say Chris was to remember a really wonderful time in his recent vacation, then he might have his hippocampus trigger you know sensations of the beach. Uh... his hippocampus might pull out some memories of his partner reading a book. His hippocampus might pull out the wind blowing on his face. The hippocampus might retrieve a lot of different pieces of information and put them back together so that Chris might experience a sense of relieving a video in his mind of the event, but it's not stored in a video form. Now the hippocampus is also involved in implicit memories which are the kind of the free floating emotions that haven't been articulated well in our brain and the explicit memory which are more factual and have a time stamp. So we know that we are recollecting something. Chris can be aware that he's remembering his vacation at the beach. While with implicit memories he wouldn't be aware that he's remembering something from the past. The implicit experience would just be added on to what's happening in the present. So for example if he was having a conflict with his partner. The um..., the-the experience of the present might be heightened with some implicit affect from the past, from past memories of childhood and having had conflicts with his family when doing the dishes. And the last thing I'll say about the hippocampus is that interestingly it tends to shrink, uh... if people are exposed to really high level of stress. Okay now let me pull out another structure here. This is brain, let's see this one here. Coming from right in the middle of the brain, let's see. Okay I have it. Okay so here we have the thalamus. 

00:15:00
Thalamus 

00:15:00
MARIE Now most people's thalamus has more like an egg shape but Chris' thalamus is more like a golf ball. Um... hmm, but anyway the thalamus is involved in-in relaying and uh... receiving information from the senses. So for example, if I was to pinch Chris really hard on the shoulder, for example, then the pain would go through the spinal cord, the neurons, it would go through the brain stem and the brain stem would relay it to the thalamus for further processing and of course the amygdala. And there would be a determination that would be made if-if the pain was really strong, then of course the amygdala would shoot a fight, flight or freeze response. Uh... but don't worry Chris, I won't, I won't pinch you. So let's see, moving on. Um... what else can we get? Let's see, okay I'm getting something from right under the cortex here. Okay and have here um... the insula. 

00:16:00
Insula 

00:16:00
MARIE Which really the insula is just um... some folded cortex that's kind of deep inside the brain. And the insula area, this is really a piece of the insula cortex, is really involved in-in paying attention and consciousness about the sensations in our body. Um... it's an area that activates quite a bit when people are involved in mindfulness meditation training. In fact it's even been determined that this area becomes a little thicker with mindfulness meditation practiced on a daily basis. So it's highly Neuroplastic. Um... let's see what else do we have. Um... okay-okay, this is a big piece, hold on, don't move. Okay now I have the cingulate gyrus. 

00:16:50
Cingulate Gyrus 

00:16:55
MARIE The cingulate gyrus is very well positioned because it has the emotional brain right underneath and the cortex right on top. So it's involved in problem solving and in um... in avoiding negative consequences. So for example if Chris was to open his email say and have an email from the IRS saying that he's done a mistake in his income tax and he owes $5000 for example. Then um... he would have an emotional reaction and his mind would immediately engage in problem solving in trying to figure out how to minimise consequences, how to avoid the unpleasant consequences. So that would go through the cingulate gyrus here. So now that we've examined the outside of the brain and more of the internal structures of the brain, we're going to start looking at the cellular structure of the brain. Now the brain is made of neuron, neuron cells. Alright, so here I'm going to try to pull out some neurons from Chris' brain, don't move okay. Oh I have two, I've got two neurons look. I have two beautiful neurons from your brain Chris, they're beautiful aren't they? So neurons communicate through bio-electrical signal, so the cell body would send an electrical signal down the axon here, would produce neuron transmitters which would activate the next cell body which would then of course given an electrical signal down this one. And so it would goes and neurons tend to have really big neural networks. Ah... it is said they can be connected uh... through seven to ten thousand other neurons forming up to 200 million miles of neural networks in our brain. So that's pretty impressive. This is why the brain is so complex and why we understand just a little bit of all the amazing things it can do. So let's see now if Chris was to have a problem or um... say that he had a fear of-of a creature of some kind. What kind of creature would that be Chris? 

00:19:05
CHRIS Oh... a dog. 

00:19:05
MARIE A dog. 

00:19:05
CHRIS Yeah 

00:19:05
MARIE What kind of a dog? 

00:19:10
CHRIS A b-big dog, with big jowls that hang down and big teeth and maybe even claws like a cat. A dog like that. 

00:19:20
MARIE Okay. Wow that would be, that would be scary, yes. 

00:19:20
CHRIS Yeah 

00:19:25
MARIE Okay so um..., so would it be okay if we um... pretended that we heard a dog like that barking, in the distance yeah? 

00:19:30
CHRIS Okay, okay. 

00:19:35
MARIE Okay, alright. So say that Chris was to hear a big dog like that. Um... there's this big neural network that would be activated. Here I only have one brain cell representing it, but it would be activated and it would be more powerful than our other neurons right? Right the neurons that we were looking at earlier could be in some ways neurons that represent uh... signals for being calm and taking a deep breath and thinking it's just a sound, it's not really dangerous. So this neural network can be activated, but at the same time this other neural network with a big neuron is co-activated. So this one has a bigger cell body, has an axon that has more meal in around it, which makes it conduct signal faster. So if you think about it, Chris may have both responses in their brai--, in his brain. This calm yourself it's okay, it's just a sound, this it's a dog barking and it's scary. When you think about it, in which direction is the brain more likely to send a signal that will trigger a response? Well most of the time the brain will fire to the fastest, strongest and most powerful neural network. Now what are we going to do about this? If we're therapist working with people, who have big problems in their lives, or who have habits, where for an educator working with a child and this child has a powerful neural network for a problem like that in his brain associated with intense negative emotions, how can we help those people listen more and activate more those other neural networks that are associated with more helpful response, than listening to the more intense problem type of response? How can we do that? 

00:21:25
How can we increase people's access to their preferred selves? How can we make changes stick in everyday lives? 

00:21:30
MARIE How can we increase people's access to their preferred selves? How can we make changes stick in everyday lives? Well helpful conversations face important challenges. First the intense negative emotions from the limbic system triggered the fight, flight or freeze response and are associated with a reduced blood flow to the frontal lobe. This is very important when a client or a child that we're talking to gets very-very upset, their minds are less able to think, because a lot of the blood flow is recruited by the limbic system for a quick emotional response. 

00:22:10
Helpful conversation face important challenges: Intense "negative emotions" from the limbic system trigger the fight, flight, or freeze response, & are associated with a reduced blood flow to the frontal lobe. Memory profoundly shaped by these networks: mood congruent recall. Attention to an experience strengthens the associated neural networks. 

00:22:10
MARIE Memory is profoundly shaped by these networks. We have a phenomenon called mood congruent recall, which simply means that when we're in a certain mood we are more likely to remember other events and other memories of times when we were in a similar mood. 

00:22:30
Mood congruent recall 

00:22:30
MARIE This of course is very involved in the depression, in the downward spiral of depression, where people become depressed. And only remember depressive memories from their lives, which leads them to become more depressed. 

00:22:45
Helpful conversation face important challenges: Intense "negative emotions" from the limbic system trigger the fight, flight, or freeze response, & are associated with a reduced blood flow to the frontal lobe. Memory profoundly shaped by these networks: mood congruent recall. Attention to an experience strengthens the associated neural networks. 

00:22:50
MARIE The third challenge is that attention to an experience strengthens the associated neural networks. So if we're giving attention to a problem experience then inadvertently we may very well be strengthening its associated network and making it more likely to be reactivated again. 

00:23:05
Several practices can help: Reduce the intensity of problem "highways"; Explore memories of desired experiences of oneself; Dwell in affect-infused examples Draw attention to a possible web of connectedness between the problem and the preferred experience of oneself; 

00:23:10
MARIE Let us now talk about therapeutic conversations. Well several practices can help. First we can reduce the intensity of problem highways. Second we can explore memories of desired experiences of oneself. And third we can dwell in affect-infused examples that are helpful for a client. And finally we can draw attention-attention to a possible web of connectedness between the problem and the preferred experience of oneself. Before I explore these different practices in more depth, I'd like to mention that some of these are inspired by the work of Michael White and David Epston and many other narrative therapist. This work is also very inspired by ideas from Daniel Seagull and many of these practices were explored in collaboration with my colleague Jeff Zimmerman. 

00:24:05
Several practices can help: Reduce the intensity of problem "highways"; Explore memories of desired experiences of oneself; Dwell in affect-infused examples Draw attention to a possible web of connectedness between the problem and the preferred experience of oneself; 

00:24:10
MARIE So let's start with the first practice, reducing the intensity of problem highway. 

00:24:15
Reducing the intensity of problem highway "To name it, is to tame it": - name the experience itself - examine the meaning - deconstruct the problem and its connection to contextual influences - gain perspective on its effects 

00:24:15
MARIE You might have heard the expression 'to name it, is to tame it'. This is a popular notion in neural science right now. Because essentially if we help a person name the experience that they're going through, it allows their brain to be more easily able to process it afterwards. Once the mind knows what it's up against, then it's more able to store it, process it analyse it and find solution to it. Once an experience is named, we can examine its meaning and we can even deconstruct the problem and it's connection to contextual influences. Sometimes these contextual influences are cultural, such as cultural discourses of patriarchy of individualism or capitalism and sometimes the contextual influences are more related to everyday life such as socio-economic status for example. Deconstructing the problem in its connection to contextual influences, allows clients to gain perspective, on the effects of these outside factors on their inner life. 

00:25:30
Brain Maps 

00:25:35
MARIE I like to use a brain map. I draw the outline of a brain, and inside the brain I might draw different sections as clients are talking and illustrate these sections with - these are thoughts and ideas that come from depression, these are thoughts and ideas that may come from self-doubt, these are thoughts and idea that may come from some notions of patriarchy about how men and women are supposed to behave. 

00:26:00
Preferred experiences of self Mindfulness meditation provides an important theoretical and experiential backdrop for both therapist and clients Clients can be invited to notice the details of their preferred experiences in a way that can enhance the neural firing and strength of those connections 

00:26:00
MARIE Another practice is to explore memories of desired experiences of one's self. This means revisiting moments when people experience themselves in preferred ways, when they felt that their best or when they felt like that when they were handling a situation well. Exploring memories of desired experiences is really helpful if we're able to get the client to vividly re-experience a situation, a specific moment to go back in time, and that specific place where they were experiencing themselves in this way. Then it's helpful to invite them to find a metaphor that would describe this experience or to think up of images that would link up the both hemispheres putting words to an experience and sensations and it is helpful to gather embodied descriptions. By embodied, I mean really specific descriptions of how their breath felt or how they were holding their head and shoulders or their legs or how they were feeling their body differently. 

00:27:20
Mindfulness Meditation 

00:27:20
MARIE Mindfulness Meditation provides important theoretical and experiential ideas about how to do this. 

00:27:25
Preferred experiences Focus on "Preferred affect infused moments" by inviting the client to describe their experience in terms of bodily sensations metaphors temperature density colors 

00:27:25
MARIE Clients can be invited to notice the details of these preferred experiences in a way that can enhance the neural firing and strengthen those connections. 

00:27:40
Describing Preferred Ways of Being 

00:27:40
MARIE After all we want clients to strengthen the connections associated with the way that they like to be in their lives. One way of doing this is to have them describe their experience in terms of bodily sensations, metaphors, but also temperature, density, colours, sometimes clients have even mentioned texture or a different weight. I've had some clients who have shared how they felt very light, now that the problem was lifted off their shoulders somewhat. 

00:28:15
Notice successes There are many kinds of successes and the majority remain unnoticed. Successes provide important information on clients' existing skills in the face of problems. Examine successes at avoiding or overcoming the problem. 

00:28:20
MARIE Another way of bringing forth preferred experiences of self is to notice success. Now there are many kinds of success and the majority of them remain unnoticed. By success I mean a time where a client could have fallen for the problem habit, but didn't. A time when they were able to navigate a tricky situation in a way that they liked. A time where they really could have gone downwards in a conflict or in a depressive or a negative mood, but they didn't. 

00:28:55
Notice successes There are many kinds of successes and the majority remain unnoticed. Successes provide important information on clients' existing skills in the face of problems. Examine successes at avoiding or overcoming the problem. 

00:28:55
MARIE These success provide important information on clients existing skills or emerging skills in the face of problems. It's really important for us in therapeutic conversations to build on that. This makes much more sense than to try and develop new skills or new neural networks. Why not use what's already in the brain? 

00:29:15
Dwell in affect-infused examples (Beaudoin & Zimmerman, 2011) Affect directs the flow of activation to different areas of the brain Shape what is perceived, remembered, believed, interpreted, ascribed meaning and responded to. It is our responsibility to enhance, dwell on and cultivate preferred affect (produces dopamine) 

00:29:20
MARIE A third practice that overlaps with what we've just talked about, is to dwell in affect-infused examples. This is an idea that came from Jeff Zimmerman my colleague. And it essentially means that clinicians should really try to find specific moments in our conversations that are loaded with affect. This is important because affect directs the flow of activation to different areas of the brain. Affect shapes what is perceived, remembered, believed, interpreted, ascribed meaning and responded to. It is our responsibility to enhance, dwell on and cultivate preferred affect, especially since it produces dopamine, preferred affect I mean produces dopamine. Which in and of itself strengthens neural networks. 

00:30:15
In other words If problems have a vivid negative affect component, then solutions need to have an equally compelling preferred affect component This can be challenging since the brain is believed to have significantly more neural networks for negative than for positive affect. 

00:30:20
MARIE Another way of thinking about this is that if problems have a vivid negative affect component, then solutions need to have an equally compelling, preferred affect component. This can be challenging since the brain is believed to have significantly more neural networks for negative than for positive affect. We are really swimming up streams. When we are trying to make positive affect more prominent in peoples brain. 

00:30:45
Draw attention and make connections Attention determines where the neural resources of the brain will be allocated, what is emphasised and what is ignored For clients to experience more choices, problem affect needs to be interwoven with neural network associated with skills and agency. 

00:30:50
MARIE The fourth practice is to draw attention and make connections. Attention determines where the neural resources of the brain will be allocated, what is emphasised and what is ignored. For clients to experience more choices, problem affect needs to be interwoven with neural network associated with skills and agency. If problems are ruminated then preferred developments must be rehearsed as well. 

00:31:20
Brain Maps 

00:31:25
MARIE So possibilities of rehearsing preferred development is to do these brain maps and to give copies of these notes to our clients or sometimes summaries or drawings or keywords, photos documents, anything that can make those preferred selves more concrete, can anchor the client in these experience. I will now do a live demonstration. An attempt to show some of these ideas in an interview. 

00:31:55
[sil.] 

00:31:55
These interviews are not scripted but rather live demonstrations of unfolding conversations. 

00:31:55
Notes are taken to summarize clients language-ing of experience at the end of the meeting, and to avoid staring at, or distracting, the client during the process of re-activating precious memories. 

00:32:10
MARIE I like to start by asking people what they like to do for fun in their free time. 

00:32:15
UNKNOWN Um... I'm a quilter. 

00:32:15
MARIE You're a quilter! Oh! 

00:32:15
UNKNOWN I'm a big quilter. Yeah I like to quilt modern quilts. 

00:32:20
MARIE Have you been doing this for a long time? 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN Um... actually just a couple of years. I've sown like my whole life, but I um... I just picked up quilting a couple of years ago. 

00:32:35
MARIE Um hmm so did you take a class or did you...? 

00:32:35
UNKNOWN Well my mom quilts and my aunt quilts, who's like my namesake, they both quilt, like they're forever. And um... and then I have a friend that started doing it and so it's kind of like, ooh... I like that. 

00:32:50
MARIE So did you end up doing that as a group with some family members or friends or... 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN I don't, although my husband tells me, it's like you need a quilting group. I'm like, I know I do. But I don't have one. I went to like um..., a couple of months ago a friend and I, we just took like a three day weekend and we went to her house and just quilted for three days, coz I don't get much time to do it, coz I'm so busy, but so that was really nice, it was like a mini quilting retreat. 

00:33:20
MARIE Yeah I can imagine, that must have been really nice, quilting retreat. So what brings you here today, what would you like us to talk about? 

00:33:30
UNKNOWN Uh... right. Well I'm um..., I'm feeling really-really stressed with work and anxious, with work um..., I don't know and it seems to be getting more and more so. But I'm handling like a lot of different things at once, which I know everyone is, but um... I guess I'm just having trouble um... you know managing it all, without feeling overwhelmed. Um... and there's one thing to be busy, there's another thing to be like so anxious and over whelmed that I'm barely, you know I'm, I'm afraid I won't be able to keep functioning or something but it hasn't quite happened but. 

00:34:15
MARIE Yeah. So there's-there's some overwhelm and then there's-there's a fear about not being able to function at some point. 

00:34:20
UNKNOWN Uh hmm 

00:34:20
MARIE But it hasn't happened yet? 

00:34:25
UNKNOWN No. I mean when I get really anxious um... like my, I feel like my minds slows down you know so I'm like not able to like check things of my list superfast and um... so that kind of gives me a thought like 'Oh my God what if it like slowed down so much that you couldn't even check things off the list. 

00:34:50
MARIE So when you're anxious your mind slows down and then you start worrying about what if it slows down more, then it may not be able to check things of the list. Yeah. 

00:35:00
UNKNOWN Unfortunately yeah 

00:35:00
MARIE Yeah, when does that tend to happen? 

00:35:05
UNKNOWN Um... well. I guess it's during the day coz I work alone from home. And so um... yeah so I, I'm kind of isolated there in a sense, so um... that's when it really gets kind of out of control. The thought you know. 

00:35:25
MARIE Uh huh, the thought gets out of control. Can you give me an example of a time recently where you felt like uh... this worry or this anxiousness about your mind slowing down. 

00:35:40
UNKNOWN Uh... sure. So a couple of weeks ago I saw in my schedule coming up that I was going to have a couple of projects, like within one week, which is a lot of work. But I thought I wanted to do it, I wanted to you know, it was other peoples schedules, that's when things could happen, so I was like I can power through, I can make this happen, and um... one day it was just like I felt like my list of things to do was so long and if I didn't get them all done in that day I didn't know what was going to happen. Um... and I had a cup of coffee, which I don't always drink so I don't know maybe that was a mistake. Um... but I was at home and I just got, I really, it was really, I was really getting overwhelmed. 

00:36:35
MARIE Hmm so you were at home and you felt that the list of things that you had to do was so long that it made you feel overwhelmed, and the coffee may have kind of contributed to some of that-that worry. 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN Yeah possibly 

00:36:45
MARIE Yeah, okay. And um... what did you start thinking when the-the overwhelm and-and the nervousness uh... took over your mind, aside from I won't be able to do it all? 

00:36:55
To name it is to tame it 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN Right I feel like it's a flood of thoughts, like what is going to be the chain reaction if these things don't get done. Um... like if you don't hire all those people that you need to get for that project and it's not going to get done. You're going to get backed up and then uh... you're not going to be ready for the next month for tha-those things the next work that's coming up and, and then um... you know other people that I work with will get behind and then. Is that what you're like talking about, like I get these thought, like the thoughts kind of, then are spiralling in different directions, so that in itself can cause like overwhelm in addition to the actual tasks that I have. I feel like I have the thoughts that um... I don't know, that are. 

00:37:50
MARIE So you had this, this spiral of thoughts that was coming from the overwhelm but also from feeding the overwhelm. 

00:37:50
Looking at the effects of the problem 

00:37:55
UNKNOWN Uh-huh yeah-yeah-yeah, that's what I was trying to tell you. 

00:37:55
MARIE That you know a lot of what ifs, you know, what will happen and a lot of kind of overwhelm seems to be breed in the future and uh... see may be problems or... 

00:38:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. Right-right. Potential problems, things that aren't even problems yet, but. 

00:38:10
MARIE Right. To see potential problems. And then what happens inside of your body when you start thinking of potential future problems because of the overwhelm? 

00:38:20
Noticing the embodied experience of the problem 

00:38:25
UNKNOWN Well I know just thinking about it actually I'm... just thinking about it I was starting to get, I noticed that my shoulders were getting all tense. Um... and my breathing gets like super shallow, like I'm not breathing quite enough. Um... and like my face I think, I don't know if it tenses up, but I'm starting to get like a headache and I feel super-super tight. And uh... 

00:38:50
MARIE Okay. So you start feeling tight and your shoulders tense and shallow breathing, and kind of a beginning of a headache sort of. Yeah, and um... at that time when you-you're at your home and-and feeling kind of the overwhelm wanting to take over. Um... how-how did you manage to escape the overwhelm? How did you move away from the overwhelm? 

00:39:15
Noticing the shift away from the problem 

00:39:15
UNKNOWN Hmm good question. Um... um... 

00:39:20
[sil.] 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN You know what I was, I had to um..., the dog needed to go out, like in the middle of the afternoon, which I don't normally take the dog down and the dog was like barking and so I thought what the heck, and so I took the dog out, and I ran into this neighbour, um... who we were talking about this landscaping situation that we have. And so I was out for like much longer than I wanted to be out. You know outside and walking around and ran into her and so we got into like a 20 minute conversation about the landscaping situation and how that was going to go and so I think like that kind of cheered me up, like having that human contact and you know getting outside, getting away from my desk for a few minutes. Um... and it definitely didn't like cure it, but I think it kind of helped breakout of like a grid lock or something. 

00:40:20
MARIE Hmm so the human contact cheered you up? 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN Yeah 

00:40:25
MARIE And it helped you breakout of the grid lock. Yeah. 

00:40:25
UNKNOWN I think so, yeah. 

00:40:30
MARIE Yeah. And um... what-what happened as you walked away from talking with this neighbour, like how were you kind of feeling different inside? 

00:40:35
UNKNOWN I feel like I was feeling a million times better. You know just a lot lighter. Um... you know, yeah, being where I live it's really warm and sunny and so I just remember feeling like woof, even when I came back to my desk I was like, oh my gosh, I really got wound up this morning. Like I felt very-very different. Um... my body felt different. I felt like I was like, had taken like the first deep breath that I'd taken like all day long. 

00:41:15
MARIE Um... so when you came back to your desk you-you felt like you had taken the first deep breath you know in the, in the day. 

00:41:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, like I don't even know if I was breathing the whole rest of the day, I felt like I wasn't. 

00:41:25
MARIE Yeah, that overwhelm was really big before. Is it ok for me to ask you a few more questions about uh... what happened when you came back from your walk and you entered into your office or your work space at home? So tell me a little bit about um... how it felt? You mentioned that it felt like the first deep breath of the day. Can you tell me uh... what you may have noticed that was different about uh... your office, than before when you were in your state of overwhelm. What was different? 

00:42:00
UNKNOWN Right. The first thing is, I don't like to take a break because then I lose track of what I'm doing, so the first thing that comes to mind is when I come back in, I'm like I sit down, like okay, what was I doing? Like um... 

00:42:15
MARIE So when you came back, the first thing that came to your mind was like 'what was I doing?' Trying to reconnect with what it is that you were about to do. 

00:42:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah 

00:42:25
MARIE Yeah. And then, and then, how is it different? To have taken this walk and re-enter your work environment, what were you? 

00:42:35
UNKNOWN Right. Well I feel like I'm kind of now looking at the whole thing. Um... yeah like my perspective is wider or something, that you know like um... yeah, even like literally, like just when you walk out of a room and then you come back in and you see like the whole room. Um... 

00:42:55
MARIE So you saw the whole room and was there anything in particular that caught your attention or that stood out for you? 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN Uh... Well I, I take a lot of effort to make my work space and my home office like be really nice and um... put things I like in there. Um... like yeah, and you know really like decorate it really well, so I guess the green walls, coz I like this really nice kind of grassy green colour of the walls. 

00:43:40
MARIE Uh-huh, so when you came back and you kind of uh... noticed more the green walls? 

00:43:45
UNKNOWN Yeah 

00:43:45
MARIE Yeah. Anything else you were able to notice from this wider perspective? 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN Well I was, I think everything seemed much more doable. You know I think I had some kind of, yeah I-I just, things seemed more doable than they'd seemed before. 

00:44:15
MARIE Hmm so things felt doable when you walked in. 

00:44:15
UNKNOWN Uh huh 

00:44:15
MARIE So what did you do? Did you walk in and go sit down at your desk? 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN Uh huh, yeah 

00:44:25
MARIE You went to sit down at your desk? 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, I think I made myself another cup of ice coffee, that before I did, I love this caramel ice coffee from Starbucks. My guilty pleasure. Um... which probably I know I said I ate too much coffee, I was, maybe that a kind of thing. But anyhow I um... I was going to go into my office and I wanted to make a nice coffee. So yeah. 

00:44:50
MARIE That's okay. So you-you walked back in to your home and you went you're your office you noticed your green walls and then you felt things were doable, and you went to make yourself a nice cup of ice coffee and then did you go back in to your work space with the ice coffee? 

00:45:05
UNKNOWN Uh huh, yeah, yeah. 

00:45:05
MARIE Okay and how is it different when you actually sat at your desk? 

00:45:10
UNKNOWN Well I think I was thinking, I was kind of started thinking, like wait a second, what am I so overwhelmed with? Like what, what is all this stuff I have to get done kind of thing and, so I like um... like made a spread sheet, which I often do and kinda just assess all the things, the projects going on, what tasks need to happen for each project. Um... yeah. 

00:45:40
MARIE Uh huh, so you-you questioned the overwhelm itself like, you wondered you know why am I so overwhelmed? And then you sat down and would you say you got organised about what you needed to do when you did the spread sheet? 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN Yeah-yeah 

00:45:55
MARIE Yeah, so you got organised, you did the spread sheet and um... and then how did that affect you to feel more organised and to look at the work in that particular way. 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN Um... well it definitely seemed more doable. 

00:46:15
MARIE Hmm it seemed doable. 

00:46:15
UNKNOWN Everything seemed more doable yeah. 

00:46:15
MARIE Okay, okay. 

00:46:20
[sil.] 

00:46:20
Re-activating the brain state associated with the movement from problem experiences to skills, reinforces the neural circuits associated with handling challenges with competency 

00:46:25
MARIE A little experiment with me, and um... just go back to that moment where you felt things were doable and you were sitting at your desk. Yeah? 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN Uh huh okay. 

00:46:35
MARIE So if you can actually uncross your legs and just sit very comfortably. And close your eyes and take a deep breath and just go back to that moment where you were sitting at your desk with this new perspective, um... that things were doable. And uh... just feel you know the chair that you're sitting in and just feel like you're back in your home office and you're surrounded by you know the green walls and other things that you have placed in this room. And tell me a little bit more about uh... what's happening inside of you when things seem doable. If you can put... 

00:47:30
UNKNOWN Um... well like I, inside of me, is that what you said, what's inside of me like. 

00:47:35
MARIE Yeah, what-what might you be feeling inside of you when things seem doable, like if you could describe some sensation i-in your body. 

00:47:45
UNKNOWN Right. It seems like there's space, like there, where there yeah. 

00:47:50
MARIE So there is some space inside your body? 

00:47:50
UNKNOWN Uh huh 

00:47:55
MARIE Yeah, is there a place in particular where you might feel more space? 

00:47:55
UNKNOWN Um... I'm thinking more like in my whole chest, upper body area. 

00:48:00
MARIE Okay, in your chest/upper body area. Does that mean that you might be breathing differently? 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN Uh huh, well I was yeah. I wonder if that's it. 

00:48:15
MARIE How are you breathing differently? 

00:48:15
UNKNOWN Well I'm like even now I'm taking like deep breaths. 

00:48:20
MARIE Hmm so you're taking deep breaths, yeah, and what else maybe different about your body? How about your shoulder and your face are those different too? 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN Yeah my face feels different. 

00:48:35
MARIE Hmm how does it feel different? 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN Um... well it feels more relaxed not so tensed up. 

00:48:45
MARIE Uh huh, okay, less tense, okay, and how about your neck and shoulders? 

00:48:55
UNKNOWN Uh... they feel like they're starting to loosen up a little bit. 

00:49:00
MARIE Okay your shoulders are starting to loosen up, you face feels more relaxed and less tense. Anything else that you notice is different when things seem doable? 

00:49:15
UNKNOWN Um... not really, I guess just overall my body feels like a little looser. 

00:49:25
MARIE Hmm so your body feels looser. Is there a-an image or a metaphor that comes to your mind when you feel your body becoming looser in this way. Like if you were to say I feel like, like, like what would come to your mind? 

00:49:45
UNKNOWN Um... well I feel really light. I'm feeling like I could kind of defy gravity almost. That light. 

00:49:55
MARIE Yeah, so you're feeling so light you could defy gravity. Can you say a bit more. Like what your... 

00:50:05
UNKNOWN Well it's totally corny, like I hate to say, I hesitate to say, coz it's so corny, but I feel like a butterfly, I'm like what is the lightest thing that defies gravity. 

00:50:15
MARIE Um hmm, yeah, so you feel like a butterfly and you're able to defy gravity. And how does that butterfly feeling um... affect your perspective on the work that needs to be done, like uh... do you look at the work differently when you're defying gravity? 

00:50:40
UNKNOWN Yeah it seems totally reasonable. 

00:50:40
MARIE Hmm so work seems reasonable. Yeah, and does it also change how you feel about yourself and your ability to accomplish things? 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah it does like I can totally do this. Almost like I could even do more. Or whatever, like this is nothing. 

00:51:10
MARIE Umm so you feel like you can do it and this is nothing and could even do more. Okay. Might there be a-a colour that might come up for you? 

00:51:20
UNKNOWN Um... I guess purple. 

00:51:25
MARIE Purple? 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN Hmm 

00:51:30
MARIE Is purple a colour that you like. 

00:51:35
UNKNOWN Hmm 

00:51:35
MARIE Yeah. What comes to your mind when you think of the colour purple or when you feel purple, I don't know if there's anything else that comes up for you. 

00:51:45
UNKNOWN Not really, I'm just seeing kind of like a whole veil of purple. I don't know if it's like a wall of purple or purple curtains or all purple everywhere. 

00:51:55
MARIE Uh huh purple everywhere. Okay and um... does that have an effect on-on your mood or how, how might that affect the overwhelm for example? 

00:52:10
UNKNOWN Right, well it seems to kinda just dissolve it actually. 

00:52:15
MARIE So dissolves the overwhelm, yeah okay, okay. Anything else that-that comes up for you when you're in that state? 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN Um... well I think of I mean I don't know if this is what you're talking about, I think of other jobs that other people do that seem really-really challenging, um... but they get it all done. Um... I don't know if I'm going to be able to describe it but it's like um..., it's not comparing myself, but it's like I can im--I can understand how really big challenging jobs get done. 

00:53:05
MARIE Hmm so you can understand how big challenging jobs get done. 

00:53:10
UNKNOWN Uh huh 

00:53:10
MARIE Yeah, and-and tell me a little bit more about how you understand it, does it come from this state of being or their experience of themselves? 

00:53:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, well I think when I'm relaxed like this, I see possibilities where I could have previously you know. I don't know if I saw the possibilities, but I see the possibilities so. 

00:53:40
MARIE So when you're relaxed, you see more possibilities, yeah. So if you were to name this state something. If you were to come up with a name for it, how would you call it, this state in which you can feel like the work uh... can get done, that you can do it and that you can see a lot of possibilities and that there's this sense of a purple veil and um... that your body's looser and your shoulders are looser and you're taking deep breaths and there's space inside of your body. 

00:54:10
The preferred experience of oneself can only be named after being thoroughly described and summarised 

00:54:15
UNKNOWN Um... well the first like immediate thing that comes to mind is like a field. 

00:54:20
MARIE Like a field. Could you say more about that. 

00:54:25
UNKNOWN Like a green field that kind of just like of tall grass that just goes on like forever. Maybe not forever, but it's really like open and sunny and like green and... 

00:54:45
MARIE So green field that goes on forever that's really open and sunny. 

00:54:50
UNKNOWN Is that what you mean? 

00:54:50
MARIE Yeah, yeah, some kind of an image, that kind of uh..., uh... reflects how you might be feeling inside, that kind of connects with the sensations that you have inside. Yeah. 

00:55:05
UNKNOWN That's the first thing that come to mind. 

00:55:05
MARIE Okay-okay. So would it make sense to call it the sunny field state or the green field state, if we were to call it something. We don't need to. 

00:55:15
UNKNOWN Yeah the green field state. 

00:55:20
MARIE The green field state, yeah. Okay. You can open your eyes if you want. Yeah. So it's a greenfield state and it's associated with all sorts of sensations. 

00:55:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:55:30
MARIE In which way might it be helpful to-to have a name for it and-and a sense of all of the sensations in your body. 

00:55:40
UNKNOWN Well if I can remember it, it seems like that would be helpful. Anything I could do to help me remember that that's a better place to be or that I prefer to be in that place. 

00:55:50
MARIE Hmm so if you could remember it, it would be helpful. Yeah. Um... are you surprised that you were able to actually enter that state right here in the office. 

00:56:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:56:00
MARIE Yeah 

00:56:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:56:00
MARIE What might it mean about your abilities to-to do this, that you're able to recreate this here. 

00:56:05
UNKNOWN Right, why do I spend any time anywhere else. It's like why not just go there? You know everyday kind of thing. 

00:56:15
MARIE So it might mean that you could go there every day. 

00:56:15
UNKNOWN Right, right. Yeah-yeah. 

00:56:20
MARIE You have the ability to recreate that. 

00:56:20
UNKNOWN Right, it's a, yeah 

00:56:25
MARIE Yeah, okay. Okay. So it means that you can enter it every day. Yeah so... 

00:56:35
[sil.] 

00:56:35
Contrasting the brain states dominated by the problem versus the experience of competency contributes to these experiences becoming clearly distinct from, and neutrally linked with, one another. 

00:56:45
MARIE So you re-entered your-your work space seeing more possibility and feeling that uh... your work was reasonable and feeling that you could do it, that you could even take on more. 

00:57:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:57:00
MARIE And you also re-entered your work space by, you know noticing some nice things about your work environment and getting a cup of ice coffee and then sitting down and starting your work. Yeah? 

00:57:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:57:10
MARIE Yeah. If you had come back, uh... still with some overwhelm, would you have re-entered your work space in the same way? 

00:57:20
UNKNOWN No, not at all. Yeah. 

00:57:20
MARIE Okay, what would have been different about you re-entering your workspace with the overwhelm? 

00:57:30
UNKNOWN Well I, I probably wouldn't get anything done or not get much done. Let me say that, I wouldn't get as much done. Um... I'd still be kind of tense and physically um... stressed and that headache, I don't know if I mentioned that but I get a headache when I'm that stressed and so that would have continued. It would have been really not very productive. 

00:57:50
MARIE So would have been less productive. 

00:57:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:57:55
MARIE And would you have given yourself permission to get a cup of ice coffee. 

00:58:00
UNKNOWN No, yeah, no-no. It takes a minute and a half, that's too long. Can't do. 

00:58:05
MARIE Ah-ha so the overwhelm wanted to focus just on work-work-work, nothing... 

00:58:05
UNKNOWN Hmm I guess so yeah. I didn't realise that, but it is true. 

00:58:15
MARIE Okay so not get a cup of ice coffee and not make yourself comfortable. Yeah okay. 

00:58:20
UNKNOWN I didn't even wanna take the dog out, when the dog needed to go out. Dog need to go to the bathroom. And I didn't even want to take the dog out, coz I was like 'don't have enough time'. That's terrible. 

00:58:30
MARIE So the overwhelm is very uh... what would you say the overwhelm get you in a place that's very what, strict or over focused or how would you say that? 

00:58:40
UNKNOWN I don't know, is it like controlling, is the overwhelm like controlling and um... I don't know why the word like sabotage is coming to mind, I was thinking. 

00:58:55
MARIE So the overwhelm may be controlling and may sabotage you an-and preventing you from taking a break or taking care of the dog or getting something to drink. 

00:59:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

00:59:05
MARIE Yeah. Okay and um... and then because it prevents you from doing these things and it also kinda gets in the way of getting things done because you can only you know focus on your screen and uh... 

00:59:20
UNKNOWN Right-right-right. Right and I can't do those things that kind of feed me. You know like, not just literally like coffee, but just taking a moment to step aside. Take a break to come back. I can't do any of that. 

00:59:35
MARIE Yeah uh huh. So it prevents you feeding yourself. Okay. So we're gonna have to stop. But um... let me summaries some of these ideas and I'll ask you what you'll be taking away from our-our discussion. 

00:59:50
[sil.] 

00:59:50
Final summaries with images or drawings contributes to the brain integrating the experiences in usable ways 

01:00:00
MARIE So um... we talked about how the overwhelm um... makes you be worried about not being able to function or to get things done and the overwhelm makes you anxious, it can slow your mind down, um... the overwhelm um... can flood your thoughts and uh... makes you wonder about a lot of what ifs, you know what if I don't get it done, you know um... what will happen to the people who need to work with me. It makes you worry about a lot of future things, you know, that means you won't be ready for next month. So the overwhelm is very future oriented and kind of bombards you with these thoughts. And um... the overwhelm can uh... really grab your body in some ways and make your shoulders tense up and your breathing shallow and even give you a headache because you can become really tight. And uh... and it really gets in the way of you getting things done or even taking care of yourself or taking care of your dog, yeah. 

01:01:10
UNKNOWN I didn't realise that, when you're listing it all like that it's pretty, yeah. 

01:01:15
MARIE Yeah-yeah. And then at the same we've discovered that sometimes you're able to move away from the overwhelm. So you gave me a-a-a-an example of a time recently where you just took the dog out and um... and you talked to the neighbour for longer than you expected and uh... you felt a million times better and were able to come back with, at your desk and take your first deep breath of the day and have a completely new outlook on things. And we talked about how you saw your work environment in a different with the greens walls and uh... you saw the whole room and you gave yourself permission to make yourself a nice cup of ice coffee. And um... you made your spread sheet to get organised and all of a sudden there was space inside of your body and your shoulder loosened up and um... your chest loosened up and you felt lighter like you could defy gravity, like a butterfly. And um... the colour purple also comes up for you when you're in that state. And uh... and images, such as green fields that are sunny and really open, and when you're in that place, uh in your mind then all of a sudden work becomes reasonable and doable and you feel that you can do it and that you could even take on some more. And um.... Yeah and that's it. So um... what is it that you might take away from our conversation today, that might be helpful in you re-entering this state. 

01:02:55
UNKNOWN Well it's huge. I feel like I could, if I just take a few minutes out or make sure I do those things that kind of um... you know like feed me or you know kind of keep me going. Um... coz that happened pretty quickly, what we just did. 

01:03:20
MARIE Yeah. You mean being able to switch from the overwhelm to the ... 

01:03:20
UNKNOWN Yeah-yeah-yeah that I can switch like that, coz I guess the overwhelm wants me to believe I can't switch or something but it's nice to know I can switch like that. Yeah-yeah that's helpful. 

01:03:35
MARIE So, so kind of noticing that you actually have some control over those states. 

01:03:40
UNKNOWN Yeah 

01:03:40
MARIE Coz they're like programs in your brain in some ways so you can actually, sometimes not always, but a lot of the times you can actually make a choice to switch from one brain state to another, when you know a little bit more about the state that you want to enter, so when you have a lot of uh... experience noticing the state that you prefer then you can more easily choose to enter it so. 

01:04:05
UNKNOWN Well 

01:04:05
MARIE Something to keep in mind. 

01:04:10
UNKNOWN Yeah 

01:04:15

The newly identified contributions to the preferred experience were integrated into the meaningful and personally relevant drawing of a quilt. 

01:04:15
Dwelling in the sensations and images associated with preferred experiences of self can also be facilitated with children as in the following conclusion of an interview with a child who endured bullying from a friend. 

01:04:15
Two brief excerpts of interviews, fully featured in "The Skillionaire in every person" video will now be shown to provide varied demonstrations of these ideas 

01:04:50
MARIE So McKenzie you mentioned that you had the green mood and the purple mood with, which helped you handle some bullying situations at school. I wonder if you can do a little experiment with me and-and try to really just live these moods here in the office with me. Is that okay? 

01:05:05
MCKENZIE Okay uh huh. 

01:05:10
MARIE So I'm going to ask you to um... close your eyes, sit comfortably and may be take a deep breath and um... just start feeling the sense of friendliness that uh... you've called the green mood that helps you respond to people at school in a way that you like sometimes. If you start feeling the green mood, can you tell me a little bit more about what happens inside your body? 

01:05:45
MCKENZIE Um... well I'd say since the green mood is talking about friendly and calm, I'd say that its mostly in your heart. Coz you're trying to be friends, so I'd say that it was in your heart. 

01:06:10
MARIE So the green mood, you feel the green mood more in your heart because it's friendly and calm. Can you tell me more, what else, like you feel. 

01:06:25
MCKENZIE Well I feel like my heart is like growing, like instead of being like the regular size of a heart my heart is just like, is like getting bigger and bigger. 

01:06:35
MARIE Hmm, gets bigger and bigger. And does it get bigger with more calm and friendliness or bigger with more... 

01:06:50
MCKENZIE Bigger with more friendly and calm. 

01:06:50
MARIE With more friendly and calm, okay. Do other parts of your body also feel different, do you breath differently or hold your head differently or... 

01:07:05
MCKENZIE Um... when I'm kinda calm, I kinda tilt my head a little bit. 

01:07:10
MARIE Okay, so you tilt your head a little bit. Anything else? 

01:07:15
MCKENZIE Um... no that's-that's mainly it. 

01:07:20
MARIE Okay, and now if we move to the purple mood, which you mentioned which is associated with you feeling confident and standing up for yourself when somebody treated you in a way that was not okay. Can you connect with that purple mood inside of you? 

01:07:45
MCKENZIE Um... this mood I'd say, you'd feel more in your mind than in your heart. 

01:07:55
MARIE Okay, so you feel it in your mind. 

01:08:00
MCKENZIE Uh huh and you kind, I kind of feel like I'm getting stronger. 

01:08:05
MARIE Okay, so that you're getting stronger, you mean physically or in terms of what you're determined to do or... 

01:08:10
MCKENZIE Well, kind of like physically and mentally. 

01:08:15
MARIE Physically and mentally stronger. So the purple mood is in your mind, and it makes you feel stronger physically and mentally. Do you feel that strength elsewhere in your body, might it affect your face or your shoulders? 

01:08:30
MCKENZIE Well I, for sure I hold my head high, and well, I like keep my shoulders pretty high too. 

01:08:45
MARIE Hmm so it makes you keep our head and your shoulders high. Anything else, does it affect how you breath, might it make you breath differently? 

01:08:55
MCKENZIE Um... maybe a little yeah. 

01:09:00
MARIE So just a little, it's mostly in your mind and feeling the strength. 

01:09:00
MCKENZIE Uh huh 

01:09:00
MARIE Yeah okay. Anything else? 

01:09:10
MCKENZIE Um... no that's-that's it. 

01:09:15
MARIE Okay, alright, you can open your eyes now, come back with your green mood and your purple mood and um... sometimes it's uh... helpful to know how these mood feel in our body, because then we can more easily choose to enter these moods, because in some ways they're brain states. So they're just states you know. So if you know how it feels, then you can make the choice to go back there is you want to. So how is that like for you? 

01:09:50
MCKENZIE Um... it was definitely something I've never done before. 

01:10:00

"With an adult client struggling with Self-Doubt and a Not Good Enough Feeling with her father, the preferred experience can even be heightened." 

01:10:10
MARIE And if you were to say I feel like or the confidence feels like something, what-what might come to your mind? 

01:10:20
UNKNOWN Um... um... letting go. 

01:10:25
MARIE Okay, feels like letting go. And if you were to put a metaphor, associate a metaphor with it, like something in nature or some other object, you might say, 'feeling confident inside of me feels like...' like what? 

01:10:45
UNKNOWN Like, I feel like a bird, I can, I could just let go and just fly. It sounds cheesy but its, I don't know why I just, I feel that I can see that. Um... I guess less baggage makes me feel more relieved of all the stress, the worries, the anxiousness. 

01:11:15
MARIE So you feel like a bird that can let go and fly with less baggage and leave the stress and the worries behind? 

01:11:25
UNKNOWN Yeah 

01:11:25
MARIE Can you um... sit with this sensation and-and just really take it in and uh... try even to make it bigger if you're able to make it greater in intensity inside of you, and perhaps comment on from a birds perspective, how do your dad's comment look like? 

01:12:00
UNKNOWN From a bird's perspective? 

01:12:00
MARIE Yeah, from a, that above kind of flying and letting go perspective, do you see the comments differently, or do you have a different relationship to these comments? 

01:12:15
UNKNOWN Um... I do. They're just comments. 

01:12:25
MARIE They're just comments, can you say more? 

01:12:30
UNKNOWN They're just comments that, that he likes to bring up, that just shows that he thinks of me. And that's, that's nice to know that he thinks of me. 

01:12:50
MARIE So they're just comments that show that he thinks of you. In some ways would they be comments that reflect that he cares? 

01:13:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:13:00
MARIE Yeah, okay, so they're just comments reflecting care. Yeah, okay. Can you come back i-in the room, um... here and-and keep that bird like sensation with you? Yeah, that feels green and uh... how you doing with that? 

01:13:20
UNKNOWN It's nice. 

01:13:25
MARIE Yeah? 

01:13:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:13:25
MARIE What um... is there something in particular that you like about it? 

01:13:30
UNKNOWN I like picturing, I like seeing kind of the green, the forest, the lake, just feeling of letting go. 

01:13:50
MARIE Uh hmm the feeling of... 

01:13:50
All of these interviews offered examples of dwelling in preferred ways of being to increase people's awareness of their skills and heighten their ability to more easily enter these brain states. 

01:13:55
MARIE All of these interviews offered examples of dwelling in preferred ways of being to increase clients awareness of their skills and heighten their ability to more easily enter these brain states. 

01:14:05
While such awareness may not be sufficient on its own to overcome some complex problems, it usually illuminates the path to the possible. It is easier to move away from a problem when you know what to strive for, when you have vivid recollections of what you can become, and when you understand more about your very own brain states and its associated experiences.

MARIE While such awareness may not be sufficient on its own to overcome some complex problems, it usually illuminates the path to the possible. After all it is easier to move away from a problem when you know what to strive for, when you have vivid recollections of what you can become, and when you understand more about your very own brain states and its associated experiences.

MARIE Thanks for viewing this video and I hope that some of these ideas will be helpful in your work and in your transformative conversations with people.
