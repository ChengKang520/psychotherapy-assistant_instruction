ANGELA  I am honored to have the opportunity to introduce Dr. Oliva Espin. This is the second time I've had the, the privilege of introducing her. She came to speak at my college, ah, a couple of years ago. She has been an important role model for me, ah, for a very long time, uhm, as a feminist, as a woman, as a woman of color, a Latina, a lesbian, an immigrant, and a deeply religious and spiritual person. Olivia speaks in her work not only from a deep well of knowledge, experience and wisdom, but also very much from her heart. Olivia has the experience of leaving Cuba, crossing a language and cultural divide, and making her home in a new place. As a lesbian who celebrates her identity, Olivia has the experience of a woman challenged by our society to live a marginalized existence but who refused to be marginalized. She has created a, loving communities among women and men who share and or celebrate her experiences. Her willingness to disclose her own personal challenges and joys has made her teaching and her scholarly work vibrant, and it inspires her tea, her students and all those who come in contact with her. Her impressive body of work, ah, on immigration and sexuality has allowed us to see the painful, complicated, and resilient world of many women who come to the United States. I want to say a couple things about, uhm, her books and, and mention her books, and then we'll hear from her. Beginning with her work on the letters of Hispanic women as they move from adolescence to adulthood, Oliva provided a view of a particular cultural understanding of female sexual development. She continued to provide broader understanding as she explore the experiences of women from different cultures that experienced immigration. What is impressive as the, as the content of this research is Oliva's courage to move outside the traditional research to methodologies of reader, research methodologies to find a way to study those who had not been seen, and provide a vehicle for their stories to be portrayed. And as you all know who are qualitative researchers, uhm, ah, in Psychology, qualitative researchers still, uhm, not considered, you know, ah, on the same plane as quantitative research, and so that's one of different struggles she has take on, taken on. Throughout her career, Oliva has always been interested in understanding the close boundary between the psychological and spiritual. She served as a research fellow over at Harvard examining the parallels between Hispanic healers and counselors, and in later years, studied Hispanic female saints. Her curious, curiosity in this area has been sustained by her own deep spirituality. And then, ah, I went to her website this morning as I was preparing my introduction, and, uhm, her website contains multiple links to the, all of the interesting areas that, about what she's written and about what she has, ah, researched and explored. Her books include, ah, refugee women and their mental health, shattered society, shattered lives. Her first book "Latina Healers: Lives of Power and Tradition," "Latina Realities: Essays on Healing, Migration, and Sexuality," and finally, "Women Crossing Boundaries: A Psychology of Immigration and Transformation of Sexuality." Uhm, this book received a Women of Color Psychologies Award from the Association for Women in Psychology. It is my great honor to present to you Dr. Oliva Espin.

DR. OLIVA ESPIN  Thank you, Angie, and thank you to the conference organizers for inviting me, uhm, to speak to you today. Uhm, I want to start by saying that this is not my usual state. Uhm, I, uhm, sprained my knee in Thailand three weeks ago, and I wish I could say that it was something fancy like running away from the tsunami or climbing an elephant or something like that. I was just putting my shoes on. (laughing) Okay. So it doesn't have anything to do with having become an elder yesterday either. 

00:05:05

00:05:05
DR. OLIVA ESPIN  Before I start, I also want to say that, uhm, I realize as I was, ah, reading the paper again that I used the term "oppression" frequently in the text, so, and I don't define it at any point in the paper, so I want to define what I mean by that. Oppression, ah, as well as privilege, ah, don't have anything to do with temporary inconveniences. They are states that are permanent. Yes, they can be modified but permanent, and they are not chosen by the person who is either oppressed or given adjudicated privilege. You don't have as an individual control over these things. So that's, I'm talking about something that is institutional and has an impact on people. Okay, I have a lot to say like I always do, uhm, and I hope it fits together. Again, as I was reading the paper this morning, I realized that this paper may also have molt(ph), multiple identities. So we'll see. (laughs) Okay. When I started my life as a Psychology student, cultural and gender differences did not exist for Psychology except as individual differences. As an undergraduate in the 1960's, I took a course on Differential Psychology. In it, the discussions of difference did not go much beyond demonstrating the inferiority of women and non-whites. Although human differences, such as sexual orientation, body ability or aging were not even mentioned. They were deemed illnesses, not expressions of human variability. To look at individual differences while ignoring power differentials has been one of the marks of the field of Psychology. In fact, Psychological theories that focus on the person rather than the social context are still used as a tool to gloss over the impact of societal power structures on the individual. As a consequence of the civil right movements of the 1960's, gender and race began to have a faint presence in the field of psychology. But for the most part, in my graduate training in psychotherapy, these differences were seen as irrelevant. There was no need to think about client's ethnicity or gender. Any therapist, almost all of them White males as were all my professors at the time, were, was seen as capable of eliciting the needed transference. The transferences would be elicited because they had to do with a client, never with a therapist. If clients mention the existence of cultural or gender differences between themselves and their therapist, this was seen as a manifestation of their transference or resistance, not anything having to do with the therapist's lack of awareness on insensitivity. Student therapists who were not receiving psychoanalytic-based training may have benefited from theoretical perspectives that appeared to be more sen, sensitive. Rogerians, of course, were supposed to be empathic, warm, and genuine toward every client. How anyone was supposed to empathize warmly and genuinely with a client of a very different background was never discussed. Rogers was possibly capable of doing this. I know for a fact that many of his followers were not. And then, and then, for Skinner's Behavior Modification and its grandchild, Cognitive Behavior Therapy, the issue was the behavior. Considering transference and empathy was unnecessary and somewhat bogus. Never mind that the behaviors being modified may have been perfectly appropriate for members of a particular cultural group. This somewhat simplistic caricature I have just presented would have been almost funny, but it had tragic consequences for many clients and for many young professionals interested in cultural issues at the time. So, one of my colleagues told me point blank at a faculty meeting during my first year as an assistant professor that the topic of cultural differences was my "pet issue" and really unimportant for the training of good therapists. Some of my colleagues in recent years have not been so blatant but have expressed similar sentiments. In no small measure, thanks to many people sitting in this room, new understandings about the importance of, for psychology of race, ethnicity, gender, class, body ability, age, and sexual orientation started appearing in textbooks and courses. Usually, as a last chapter or the last session of a course. Slowly, some new courses on these topics also started appearing that eventually, in the course of two decades, became required for accreditation and licensing. At least officially, these issues are no longer dismissible as the pet issues of individual psychologists who are more activist than scholars. The initial approach to addressing cultural difference in psychology was to address each culture and each issue separately. Offering one of these first courses on cross-cultural issues in psychotherapy, I do taught race in one session, gender in another, and so on. But as I reflected on my teaching and personal experiences, as well of those of my clients, I became progressively aware of the limits of this segmented approach. A marking event for me occurred at a professional conference in the late 1970s where women of color talked about racial loyalties as being in opposition to women's issues. I remember feeling puzzled and conflicted. Weren't we women? Why see this as oppositional issues? They were both of equal interest to us, I thought. The attitude of these women, of course, I understood later, was partly a manifestation of gender power hierarchies in action. Your husband's career was always more important than yours. And women meant White women in the racial power hierarchy. Therefore, women of color had to choose for or against the interest of others, never for themselves. Early in my career, I had encountered a feminist movement and had found its basic tenets consonant with my own life experience. In psychology, feminist ideas had started manifesting through research aiming to demonstrate that women were not inferior to men, or that different from them in their skills and capabilities. Jean Baker Miller's book, Toward A New Psychology Of Women, that first appeared in 1976, looked at feminine psychological characteristics as a consequence of women's roles rather than a demonstration of pathology or psychological immaturity. Her words echoed what Brazilian educator Paolo Frede(ph) had been saying about the psychology of oppressed people. But at this time, most of the emphasis in the effort to incorporate cultural issues and differences in psychology was still placed on racial ethnic differences. Time and again, I felt that that particular identity or part of me needed to be given precedence over other parts. If I identified as a woman or a feminist, not even mention a lesbian, I was openly challenged as a traitor to my Latino Hispanic roots. Because the majority of my clients were women of color and, or immigrants from different parts of the world, grasping what was most important to each one of them was not an easy task. Yes, their ethnicity was an important factor in their life experience as it was for me, but they lived that ethnoracial experience as women. And that gave it a unique flavor. Yes, some issues took precedence at one point or another but these different identities were present all the time, in me and in my clients, influencing and modifying each other, and creating a unique personal experience. While some of these happen at a professional level, I was also struggling with my own identity and my own understanding of who I was in this US society. Here, I was an immigrant, the ways in which I was seen and I saw myself were sometimes in active opposition to each other, and that may be still be true as you would hear later. The temptation to peg people to certain categories to the exclusion of others is a powerful force in human interactions. But it is impossible to pick apart and separate these identities in an individual without destroying the person. Some, let me use myself as the concrete example of what I'm describing. Let's imagine for a moment that I walk into your office as a prospective client. What do you see when you see me? If I had not spoken, if you did not know who I was, if you had passed me on the street maybe or at your office door, what would be your impression of who I am? If you do not hear my accent, do you peg me down as a White European American? Particularly after my dak, dark curls became white, limp hair. That I now color with this fake color. Uhm, indeed, my grandparents were Europeans from Spain. So it's only an accident of birth that makes me a Latin American. But what an important accident of birth this is. It has shaped the course of my life, my identity as a person, my political commitments, and deter, the course of my professional career. I would not be standing here were it not for that accident of birth, because what I think, the way I see the world, the were, the way I work, the way I live are the determined by it. These presumptions affect the mundane as the mementos. As I was writing, I remember that my mother, whose English was very limited, was constantly accosted in the streets of New York when she lived there by people asking for directions. While her darker skinned Columbian friend who was fluent in English was frequently ignored by those same people because she did not look American.

00:16:35
DR. OLIVA ESPIN  Uhm, concretely, some of the things I have to work on being a woman of color was a strange concept for me as an immigrant. It was very clear to me that being made into one did not make, did not have much have to do with feeling like one. To express confusion about how to place myself in this US specific categorization was perceived by many of my friends as an attempt to use the color of my skin to pass and separate myself from others. Slowly, I started to understand that there was a deeper meaning to the term "women of color," which had to do with my position in a social context. That was now different from whatever I had known before. My internal universe started shifting. I started feeling and seeing myself as a woman of color once I understood my new social space and realize that physiognomy did not have much to do with my place in the social hierarchy of oppression in the US. By then, I felt deeply identified with Hispanic Latinos and understood the dynamics of being a person of color in the US. But my Cuban heritage has been more than once a bone of content, a bone of contention, and still is, both among Cuban friends and relatives, and among friends and communities, and colleagues from other communities of color. On the one hand, I can and do understand the pain and anger of hu, Cuban exiles and the political conservative they provoke, even though I don't share their political views. However, according to some Cubans, I am at the edge, if not already inside the communist party, because of my outspoken commitment to social justice issues. Conversely, most people who know I am Cuban born immediately draw con, draw conclusions about my social class background, political beliefs, and voting behavior. They quickly assume I am a conservative republican over class White woman, White Cuban, and respond to me as such. Let me tell you a little about my life and childhood. It may come as a surprise to know that I lived my childhood in poverty. No less harsh because it was hidden between the trappings of the middle class life that my parents had known in their youth and wanted to believe they still enjoyed. My paternal, ah, maternal grandfather was an immigrant from Spain and had been illiterate, so my mother was particularly intent in pretending she was middle class. My father had been a Navy lawyer in Cuba in the 1930's. He had obtained his position after years of study and days of written examinations. He had married my mother and had two children, thinking himself securely employed. Then in December 1941, Fulgencio Batista, who had been elected president for the first time the previous year, after several attempts at seizing power, reorganized the Cuban armed forces. My father was completely unprepared when Batista fired him together with all other officers across all branches of the military known to be unsympathetic to his government. It was the tail end of the depression shortly before the beginning of the Second World War. My father was left without a job and with a young wife and two daughters to feed. He had a teaching credential and with more hope and understanding conceived the idea of starting his own elementary school and commercial academy. Barely six months after Batista's action, we moved to a flat above a house-painting store in a commercial district in Havana. There, my father started his school and I found myself transplanted to a cramped space at the back of this small school in the middle of the traffic bustle of Havana. The rest of my childhood took place in that space, my two brothers were there, were born there, my sister and I had our first periods there, and there, I built a world of fantasy in my head to compensate for the dreary and limiting surroundings in which I felt imprisoned. I spent my childhood surrounded by desks and blackboards, eating lunch and dinner quickly because the dining room area had to be turned into a classroom for the afternoon and evening classes. I spent hours as quiet as possible behind forbidden doors so that my father's classes were not disrupted by any sense of our presence. The school failed miserably, anyone with any marketing sense would have guessed that it was condemned to failure. There was barely enough money for food. The daily diet was rice and beans or tasteless spaghetti. I hated these foods and I ate very little. Rejecting food became a way of life. I weighed under a hundred pounds until I was over thirty. I wore clothes discarded by relatives or family friends who had outgrown them. Only spirituality, fantasy, and the desire to learn kept me going during most of childhood and adolescence. I read voraciously and fantasized of the realities and prayed for them. It was in my father's school, on top of desks and next to big blackboards that I played at being Joan of Arc during vacations and on weekends when all the students were gone. My fantasy life saved me. Through it, I constructed possible worlds, some of which I have been able to realize, although I have never become Joan of Arc. I did not go to my father's school. My parents wanted to preserve for my siblings and me the sib, the middle class opportunities they had anticipated for us, that were interrupted by arbitrary political events beyond their control. So my father, using his church friendships and connections, got scholarships for my three siblings and me at private schools for middle class girls and boys. I learned to lead a double life. By day, I lived among girls, who at four o'clock, went back to homes with the porches, patios, gardens, and garages that I pretended to also have, while I retreated to the two rooms in the back of my father's school, and as quietly as possible did homework and read and fantasized. The next day, I made sure none of my classmates knew where I had spent the night. As you can see, my social class experienced is rather muddled and confused, to say the least. The experience of childhood poverty has marked me forever. Keeping the secret of that poverty was a constant source of pain during childhood and adolescence. But it was a lesson in keeping to the essentials that have served me well as a therapist to learn how to keep the secrets of others. Another important aspect of my life and a source of professional involvement has been my sexual orientation. Most people who look at me presume that I'm a heterosexual woman possibly with several children and now, possibly with some grandchildren giving priority to family over other concerns. Isn't that what it's true of all Latina women? They may be surprised to have out, to find out that they have guessed wrong, no children, no grandchildren, and above all no husband. At least, not after a brief marriage over thirty year, of thirty years ago. I, I know that I don't look like a lesbian, whatever that means. My coming out as a lesbian before 1973 created some anxieties about my professional life. How to be a good psychologist if I was "sick," never mind that I did not feel sick at all. But in fact, felt more alive and complete than ever. Luckily, a few years, uhm, in a few years after this, not only the "sick" label disappeared but there was a new division of the APA that focused on the study of gay and lesbian issues that, and that there were innumerable colleagues who share in the identity and professional interest concerning sexual orientation. However, among Latinos, this was not an easy issue. I was told once at a meeti, meeting of Latinas in the 1980's that lesbianism is an illness we catch from American women. And of course, we all knew that there are no lesbians or gay men among immigrants. Some people just get to be like that as a consequence of acculturation in American society. I'm quoting people, some, okay. I have lived most of my adult life as a lesbian, which leads many people to believe that I have no use for religious feelings since most religious institutions disapproved of my lifestyle. However, nothing matters to me more than my relationship with God. Nothing. Yet, I refused to let religious institutions and authorities determine who I should, who, determine how I should or will live. Religion is not only about rules and holy books. It is about our innermost beings, our expectations, hopes, and desires for transcendence. Spiritual beliefs have provided forms of expression for people that were otherwise excluded from the main, mainstream to express themselves. Latin American liberation theology, the black church in the U.S., and the medieval European mystics have a lot in common regardless of the differences in centuries, geography, and social context. For me, as for many people, a relationship with the divine, whatever that is and however it's interpreted is a source of life and freedom, not a constricting force that stifles my inner being. I have come to believe that killing the appetite for God or alternatively, the sexual drive in one's self is a form of surrendering to and bolstering the power of patriarchal oppressive forces. 

00:28:15

00:28:15
DR. OLIVA ESPIN  Glad to know that some people think the same. I have observed in myself and others that far from being destructive, religious beliefs can enhance psychological well being as well as health in general. Research shows that prayer is a source of strength for many and that prayer works. It shows that, research shows that elderly people who attend church are psychologically and physically healthier than those who do not. As many recent studies demonstrate, it is important to enlist the person's spiritually in the recovery and healing from psychological trauma or physical illness. It is not belief in God or whatever name we give to that, that damages people psychologically or creates useless destructive guilt. The damage comes from half-baked and limited religious education filtered by sexist, racist, heterosexist authority figures. 

00:29:30
[sil.] 

00:29:30
DR. OLIVA ESPIN  Thank you (laughs). 

00:29:40
[sil.] 

00:29:40
DR. OLIVA ESPIN  Just as we educate our clients and students so they understand they are not guilty for having been abused or raped, we could help them see that it is not God who's punishing or persecuting them, but rather some of the self-declared agents of God to transmit, who transmit their own sexism, heterosexism, and on racism as if it was God's word. Let me again state that I know that religion has been and continues to be used as a force to keep people in their place and away from self- realization. Yes, religion can be oppressive but so can psychology. Let me remind you, let me remind you that as multicultural psychologists, we do not let sexism, racism, or homosex, or heterosexism, or Freud, Jung, or Stanley Hall or some other little in psychology define what the discipline is or should be. In fact, creating a new psychology with and for people in oppressed groups is our life's work. By the same token, we should not let popes, priest, ministers, or rabbis tell us what God really is. We would not accept, for example, that women should not go to therapy because Freud was a sexist. So we should not accept that women should not be religious because the Pope or other male religious leader is a sexist. It is very important, again, not to deprive clients or students from these very important source of a, of strength. We should encourage ease, each person who believes to establish their own relationship with the Divine. Let me tell you a little anecdote. I hope it won't take a whole lot of time about prayer. I, when I, uhm, sprained my knee, initially, I went to the hospital and the Thai doctor who saw me said, "It seems now you have a torn ligament," and they put me in a cast from thigh to ankle and I had a walker. My hands were just unbearably painful from holding that. I couldn't take a shower on and on and on and on, and he had said this was going to be like that for four to six weeks. Until I got here, they were able to take a look at me and see what was really going on. I was sitting at a temple, uhm, actually in, in a car because I was just exhausted from getting in and out of cars and that kind of thing. And this man, with a European accent, comes to me and says, "What's that with your leg?" And I told him, and he said, "Oh, you don't need that. Let me uhm, help you with that." He took the cast off, put me on bandages, gave me extra sizes, and I would not be walking now, as I'm walking even with the aid of this uhm, if it weren't for him. Before that, as I was sitting in that car, I was praying. So I was I, I, I had, something had to change. So, ah, it was, it was unbearable to give, to keep that and the idea of having that for the next four weeks. I probably had to have been on a wheelchair here and here, carried up to this stage and et cetera had it not been for that. And I believe that was the result of prayer. You can believe whatever you want but that's what I believe. Okay. Last cite, okay. The question remains how to deal with all the apparent contradictions in identity in a particular person. First, are they truly contradictions for the person? You may be surprised to know that I experienced that if I experience any conflict, it stems from the position of those around me who want me to choose my true identity. Concretely, it is as difficult for me to deal with Church teachings about my sexual orientation as it is to deal with other people, lesbians included, who think it is ridiculous and absurd to believe in anything spiritual, unless it is the God, of course. It is difficult to choose between my political commitments and my Cuban heritage because people expect me to renounce one or the other. For me as for many others, the issue is to find room for my multiple selves, a task made difficult by the expectations that I choose one identity and stick to it. In a therapy situation, the therapist discomforts are not about not being able to pin down the client, maybe more the problem than the client's sense of multiple identities. Perhaps, I'm a puzzle. But like any puzzle, if all the pieces are not in, if some pieces are discarded, there's not a complete pictures of me. Another metaphor that I like even better, the pictures inside the kaleidoscope do not exist without the fragments of colored glass that make it up. Each of my apparent internal contradictions modifies and enhances the others. And each of these little pieces of colored glass inside the kaleidoscope contributes to the beauty of the total picture. For the most part, it is still very hard to speak about some of these issues without offending someone or someone taking offense, which is not quite the same thing, or finding myself alienated, or finding myself alienated from those who do not want to hear what they interpreted as divided loyalties. Precisely because am I, I am caught in hierarchies of oppression in so many different aspects of who I am, emotional, political, and cultural communities of belonging are essential for my surviving, and misunderstanding from those communities, it's particularly painful. Because most people do not live with the awareness that we live in a context of normalized injustice, it is easy to ignore the power of horizontal oppression as an effective tool of domination. Trying to address those injustices that touch us most closely, we may end up creating similar injustices for others. We may end up becoming complicit in the oppression of others through our efforts to liberate ourselves. Those who do not fit our own category of oppression, as we think they should, become authorized as cruelly as the powerful authorize us. The individual pain is intensified by the structurally caused pain. We become unaware agents of the forces of oppression that we think we are fighting by, for example, deciding that homosexuals do not belong in our churches or do not deserve the same rights because there is chosen behavior. Uhm, I am now convinced that racism and nationalism derive their strength from sexism. Studying immigrant, no, it's not the cause but they're strengthened by it. Studying immigrant women from different cultural backgrounds, I have observed over and over how women are made to carry cultural values and behaviors at the expense of their own lives. Women's bodies are policed in the name of tradition. Policing women's bodies and behaviors becomes a mean of asserting superiority. It is an attempt at preserving the past admin, admits the social constant transformation. This is not just a benign manifestation of interesting traditions. It may cost some women their lives. By the same token, conflicts about sexual orientation become a territory to preserve gender structures untouched and uncontested. I know now that a lot of what we believe to be truths about color and race like sexual or gender, sexual orientation or gender, are culture-specific metanarratives that fit one group but may not fit another. Let me give you a concrete example about a situation that I'm frequently confronted with in terms of how some tools of oppression work. Uhm, in my work with immigrant women and women of color uhm, I am frequently, I'm gonna skip here a little bit, yes, let me, let me go back a second here. Uhm, because middle class people of European descent, feminist included, have been accused of being racist or not culturally sensitive, some efforts to enhance awareness of so-called minority issues may be dangerously destructive for women, even more so because they are carried out with such good intentions. Frequently, when outsiders to a given cultural group are trying to become sensitive, they attribute behaviors that would be unacceptable in members of the majority culture as being part of the culture of this group. In an effort to manage some of the guilt generated by largely unacknowledged racism, we easily forget that sexism is no more deserving us respect when it is spoken in other languages or dressed in other cultural robes. 

00:39:30
[sil.] 

00:39:30
DR. OLIVA ESPIN  Similarly, racism is not to be tolerated in the name of advancing true feminism. The balance between these two is a delicate or absolutely necessary one. Uhm, to rectify past errors, efforts have been made ah, theorizing feminism from multicultural and international perspectives. No self-respecting feminist will be openly associated with racist interpretations of women's lives. Ironically, sometimes those same feminists, in an effort to demonstrate their sensitivity to, toward other cultures, accept male definitions of cultural identities and behaviors. In my consultation and training activities concerning immigrant communities, professionals often tell me that wife abuse is part of these people's culture, therefore it should be tolerated. My response to these comments is always this. Wife abuse is also part of mainstream U.S. culture. And as helping professionals, we would not dream of advocating tolerant for it in mainstream culture. Even though I can understand the displacement of anger to women and children among immigrant and ethnic minority men who feel deeply frustrated in their efforts to obtain recognition for their manho, manhood from mainstream society, acceptance of violence against women as an outlet for their frustration or as a legitimate reaction to their own oppression is unjustifiable and immoral. And it should not be cloaked. 

00:41:10
[sil.] 

00:41:10
DR. OLIVA ESPIN  And it should not be cloaked in a mantle of cultural sensitivity. In fact, this need for recognition of manhood is another manifestation of sexism, of any manhood for that matter. Okay. Uhm, another example and then I'll finish. I have been present at more than one meeting or conference where ritual- celebrating diverse cultures are performed. Commonly of those rituals, one hears reference to a, spiritual forces in masculine terms. Whenever I have objected to this sexist language, I have been told that it is their tradition and their culture. Therefore, to be culturally sensitive, we should respect their use of masculine terms. Okay, let's consider this comparison. It has been part of my tradition and cultural background to start ceremonies saying, "In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit." Yet, my guess if I had started this talk with those ritual words, you would have been shocked and dismayed at my lack of awareness to the sexism in those words. So why is it that we can be aware and sensitive to the flaws of traditional western ways but feel blindness, but feign blindness to the same issues in other cultures? Why is it that when we talk about non-Christian and non-Jewish tradition, it is okay to be respectful of things that we believe their much women and we are trying to change in our own traditions? I have a long thing to, about this that I'm not gonna be able to say but, simply put, sexism is never justifially, justifiable in the name of cultural differences even when it may be sponsored by women. Indeed, the acceptance of questionable aspects of religions and cultural traditions may be a demonstration of our lack respect for those cultural group by assuming that these women and these people are able than us to deal with a ra, racism, sexism, heterosexism inside their own traditions. And I have a long thing here about it is a point, you know, it is an expression of our own arrogant attitude towards other people and paternalistic attitudes to say, "Poor people, we have to tolerate that." They don't know what they're doing. Okay. When in fact, they're perfectly capable of doing it. Okay. Uhm, my point is that we need to reflect on the implications of what seems to be respect for customs that target mainly women or people of diverse sexual orientations and that have serious consequence for the rights to these people and for the right to emotional and bodily integrity. So we have to preserve sensitivity while continuing to foster, uhm, liberatory and emancipatory ideas. And. 

00:44:10
[sil.] 

00:44:10
DR. OLIVA ESPIN  I have several pages here that I am not gonna get to in terms of clients and et cetera. Let me just finish by saying, as I have described my own story, both personal and professional, has been shaped by the crossing of borders, by the transgressing of borders in the sense that Glorian Saldua(ph) introduced the term. These borders have not always been easy to cross, both literally and figuratively. And Saldua(ph) points out that borders are sites where different cultures, identities, classes, races, genders, and sexual orientations collide and coexist. The endeavor to transcend these borders to be who we are is the survival tool for individuals who experience their identity as an internal kaleidoscope. To do otherwise is to lose yourself. Learning to live with contradictions without showing, shying away from them, learning to claim all you are, not just aspect of yourself that are acceptable to those surrounding you at a particular moment in your life, is essential for self-preservation and healthy development. To obtain the power and freedom so unjustly denied to us and to many of our clients is an act of social justice and liberation. Therapy needs to be able to foster this healthy development if it is going to fulfill its promise. Untold strength for our common struggle for social justice in the field of psychology and in the world in which we live can come from accepting and encouraging the multiple sources of identity and er, energy in a person. Creating our own story at the borders of our own multiplicity can be a powerful source of energy. After all, the Himalayas were created and grow taller everyday out of the collision of the border of Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The struggle is worth it because it will produce an equally beautiful, awesome, enormous effect in our society and in the field of psychology. Thank you.
