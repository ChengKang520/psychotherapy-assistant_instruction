LIVE: BOSTON SEAPORT WORLD TRADE CENTER Paul Frewen, Ph. D., C. Psych DR. DESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE Mindfulness, Heartfulness & Trauma Therapy 

00:00:00
PAUL FREWEN So, I've been entitled to talk mindfulness, heartfulness and trauma therapy and I was, ah, recently in Rome along with, ah, Jon Kabat-Zinn was there. And this term heartfulness was one that came up, ah, a number of times, it's-- is the balance, uhm, between of course the work that we do on the cognitive level and as we've also heard about the work that we do on the embodied level, as well as the, you know, the emotional level and as we said I'd like to, ah, have some of the talk, ah, focused on positive feelings, their absence in the traumatized population and how we can, ah, maybe begin to work on those positive feelings. So it's not just the reduction of the negative but it's the, the good feelings that we're all after. Uhm, I would like to, ah, dedicate this talk to Kim Frewen who is in the audience my wife, glad to have her here. And uhm, I'm not sharing, ah, my heart with anyone except her but I also have to dedicate this talk to, ah, Maria who's gonna be, ah, the case study that I'll present as part of the talk towards the end of it. So this talk, ah, as I said both mind and heart, we're gonna talk about, ah, concentration as one of the, uhm, difficulties that's, ah, traumatized, ah, people have and how we can work with concentration on the mind level and then on the subject of compassion in particular self-compassion. Uhm, the work on heart level. And what I like to have is hopefully just a few take home, ah, examples of interventions that, ah, people might try and we're trying to sort of validate with our research but maybe, uhm, those in the audience might find helpful. So why, ah, work on mindfulness and meditation well, we know from the way PTSD is defined another trauma related disorders, uhm, that there are these problems with the regulation of attention. That's-- they experienced concentration problems, they, ah, will tend to try and avoid, ah, difficult feelings, as would be normal. Uhm, they experienced dissociation, they experienced intrusions, thoughts and memories when they are not wanting to have those, they're having a nonetheless, as if the mind is got a mind of its own. And so were trying, ah, to maybe provide some regulation of attention or function and hopefully there would be a therapeutic benefit of doing that. And of course, affect regulation is a problem in trauma disorders. People would experience much fear and anxiety, ah, also anger, loss, guilt, and shame, will have a little bit of a focus in this talk on this idea of positive affect tolerance, the inability to experience positive feelings, they're sort of push away, there are numb notes and such. And particularly we'll try and work with self-compassion, ah, that's another problem that a trauma survivors have li-- little self-compassion. So there's increasingly researchers looking at sort of correlations between measures of mindfulness, uhm, mindfulness related traits and various, ah, difficulties, negative affect, depression, anxiety and including post-traumatic stress. And there's a strong correlation between mindfulness in trait negative affect and neuroticism but the trouble here is, are these two different things are measures of these different concepts, mindfulness, and neuroticism, trait negative affect that they're correlated or instead are they sort of overlapping in the sense of how we're measuring them and it's not really much to say that there is a correlation because in many ways through the same thing in terms of how we're measuring them. 

00:03:40
Examples of Trait Mindfulness Scale Items with Face Validity as Measures of Neuroticism/Trait Negative Affect Mindful Observing (FFMQ) When I'm walking I When I take a shower 

00:03:40
PAUL FREWEN So examples of trait mindfulness scale items that sort of our face valid measures of neuroticism and trait negative affect. These are measures of mindfulness but how we're measuring them, how much a person criticizes themselves for having irrational, inappropriate emotions, uhm, they have trouble, ah, regulating their attention again due to day dre-- daydreaming, worrying otherwise, distracted. They tell themselves they shouldn't be feeling the way they're feeling. And we might argue that those measures have much to do directly with trait negative affect and neuroticism. There are other mindfulness related traits like mindful observing that are little bit, ah, more independent. For example, this tendency to when I'm walking, we did a lot of, ah, sightseeing in Boston yesterday. While I was walking, was I deliberately noticing the sensations of my body moving. Well, to some extent we're gonna very on that, right, but, uhm, this concept of paying attune to the body and my sensations during movements while standing still, while monitoring the breathe, how aware am I and how much do I tend to orient, to pay attention. This was is what, ah, mindful observing has to do with. And we found in a study those that were higher on this trait mindful observing while they were imagining themselves in different emotional situations, those would typically invoke fear, rejection, relaxation, affection, praise, those people that were more mindful, ah, in an observing way, they activated the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex more. This is a scenario were bringing in we've heard a lot about already. And, uhm, this is the area that bringing its most active during emotional, ah, provocation in, in the scanner. Also, ah, those individuals that were more, ah, mindful observing activated left amygdala more. And three of the four emotional states. This is the same area of the brain during the same task we showed in PTSD subjects that the more they were recording symptoms of emotional numbing, the less active was this area of the brain the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. In particular, this was in the emotional, ah, imagery situations where they were clearly had a social element. Imagine someone, ah, giving you praise, what a good job, what a great talk this was Paul. Uhm, versus rejecting, "Jeez, can you pull the guy, you know, get this guy off to the stage." In each to those cases it's a social situation cuz I've got to reflect on myself and I'm getting information from another person, positive or negative, uhm, the more the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was firing, the less they numb, okay, uhm, so it's a negative correlation. The more numb, the less dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Now, that's one way to measure, uhm, some complex psychological, ah, traits like mindful observing. I'm gonna, ah, try and, ah, introduce you to a, a more simple approach. Uhm, we call this meditation breath attention scores and we use this to both measure, uhm, concentrate of capacity as well as, ah, I'm gonna talk about, it might be, uhm, potentially, uhm, an intervention as well to train, to improve concentration. Now William James, he said the faculty of voluntary bringing a wondering attention over and over again back to itself, right. That's the very root of judgment character and will. No one is master of himself if he have it not, and education which would improve this faculty will be the education par excellence. And that's really what's we're doing in, in most, most medications, right? Where the instruction is to pay attention to the breath, pay attention to inhalation, pay attention to the exhalation. The mind will wonder that's inevitable, when we notice the mind wonders, it comes back. Noticing what threw it away, but then letting go of that and then coming back to the breath. And that's the instruction that we give, ah, participants during a 15-minute meditation, and in every 3, ah, minutes, ah, 3-minute intervals, we, ah, just ring a bell and, ah, the assessment is at that point where was your mind? Where was your attention? Where is your awareness? Ah, was it on the breathe or was it elsewhere? And, uhm, as part of sort of a time keeper I'm just going to, ah, start a, ah, a meditation for us, the bell will ring at 3-minute intervals. This is a timekeeper to keep me on track with this, this talk, uhm, so that I don't, ah, wonder too far away. As well, uhm, at this sort of soundings he might just, uhm, he might just pay attention, ah, what was, what was happening at that moment. So everybody can hear that and we would just pay attention to the bell sounds and we'd, ah, be aware of the bell until the bell ceases to sound that is that our ears can no longer hear it. Just measuring at this 3-minute intervals at this bell soundings, uhm, was the person aware of the breathe or were they aware of something else mind wondering as refer it from Thomas. Uhm, that score correlates with other measures of mindfulness, the extent to which their act with awareness, uhm, and such survey reports. This mindful breathe attention awareness skill was not related to negative thought frequency however, so it shows this independence from measures of neuroticism trait negative affect at the other survey approaches to measuring mindfulness, uhm, do not. We've done a number of studies since our, our first study in 2008 using this approach, uhm, and undergraduates again we showed this correlation between the score, the meditation breathe attention score and various self-report survey measures of mindfulness related traits. And we also showed that, uhm, in terms of experiences during the meditation what did people report? Experiencing. Those that scored higher on this concentration there were more paying attention to their breathe at those 3-minute intervals. They were more relaxed, they reported less difficulty maintaining their attention on breathing, they were, ah, experienced less fatigue, they reported being more aware of their breathe and they were also more likely be using a mantra for example breathing in, one, two, three, four, and breathing out, one, two, three, four to keep them, ah, concentrated in-- a such.

00:10:25
PAUL FREWEN Another study again in an undergraduates, this time we use the strength four different meditations that were, ah, spaced out for about 7 to 10 days, and, uhm, we show good test, re-test reliability that is the person who was, ah, able to continue their attention towards their breathe that the first meditation was also likely to be the same person that was able to keep their attention on their breathe during the second third and fourth meditation. Also we showed practice effects, overtime people tended to get better at this. From the first session to the sec-- second session they improved, from the second to the third they didn't but then further impor-- improvement form the third to the fourth session. Finally, the extent to which they were, ah, paying attention, uhm, and practicing, ah, meditation in between the sessions on their own, the more likely they were to, ah improve their score on the meditation breathe attention score. That short little tone rather than the long bell I would, would have preferred the long bell but that short little, ah, tone was our next, ah, interval, that was 3 minutes. 

00:11:30
MBAS & Meditative Experience at T1 

00:11:30
PAUL FREWEN Here, we replicated these findings, uhm, more relaxed, how, now maybe that other tone was somebody else, I don't know if there's our-- there's a 3 minutes. More relaxed less reported difficulty maintaining attention to the breathe more aware of the breathe. And across time again we replicated many of these findings, more relaxed, ah, less planning behavior, what am I gonna have to do after this meditation? What am I gonna have to eat tonight? When is the next exam coming up? Uhm, and again the difficulty versus awareness of breathe. 

00:12:05
MBAS & Correlation with Attention Network Task (ANT) n=13 

00:12:10
PAUL FREWEN We've most recently shown during a cognitive task the attention network task, those people that do well on this meditation breathe attention score. Again they maintain their attention towards the breathe less mind wondering, they're also doing better on a, ah, experimental approach to measuring attention with respect to orienting and accuracy on the attention network task. So in summary, uhm, we've got this measure meditation breathe attention score that exhibits good test, retest reliability. Sensitive of the effects of repetitive practice of meditation, it associates with a survey approaches to measuring mindfulness related traits. Uhm, it associates with experiences during the meditation itself, uhm, it's also associated with other survey, ah, of what I experienced during the meditation and, uhm, correlated with attention that were tasked performance. So how might, ah, this be use, uhm, what I do right now is certainly not a 15-minute meditation during a psychotherapy session with a traumatized client. Eyes closed, disengage from the therapist, that wouldn't be, ah, a healthy approach I recommend at all, what we do the 3-minute meditations and we have that bell sounding every 45 seconds. And at that point, uhm, what we're doing is just paying attention not so much where was, ah, you know, what's my attention on the breathe as much as what was I aware of at that moment? You know, what was coming up? And this is training awareness, this is training attention towards one's own experience increasingly aware of what I'm experiencing versus a state of emotional numbing for example where I might be experiencing something but I'm not aware of it. 

00:13:55
Self-Compassion % Positive Affect Tolerance Joy, Pleasure, & Triumph 

00:13:55
PAUL FREWEN As well the concept of alexithymia that you might be familiar with, apprise here as well. So, we've talked a little bit about this idea of concentration work. Now let's turn to, ah, maybe what's even the more harder task, this task of self-compassion, positive affect tolerance. So in life, you know, what we want here is of course experiences of joy, pleasure and triumph. That's what we're really after, an, uhm, ah, those phrases, uhm, roots, ah, often use, I think they're very important. So just these, ah, pictures and as we have this next bell just, you know, maybe paying attention, you know, and, you know, how often have we experienced what these people are experiencing, you know, we might want more of this, it'd be nice. But can we imagine, you know, how many of these people would we say, you know, we would predict to have, you know, severe trauma histories, right. Probably not many, right, you know, I would say this is really what it's about, it's not about, you know, this reactivity, experience reactivity, uhm, it's about that but it's I think it's more about the inability to experience these kinds of feelings. Okay, and this is what we're really after. 

00:15:15
Anhedonia - 2 concepts HEDONIC DEFICIT (HD) HEDONIC NEGATIVE AFFECTIVE INTERFERENCE (NAF) POSITIVE AFFECT 

00:15:15
PAUL FREWEN Uhm, and so we developed sort of an approach to measuring this, uhm, which you say that you can. You're not able to experience even when you try, even when good things in your life happen. This experiences of true happiness, cheerfulness, joy, physical sensory, enjoyment, pleasure, euphoria, bliss, feelings of interest enthusiasm, excitement, feelings of relaxation, pefu-- peacefulness, inner contentment, self-esteem, pride. And what we wanna say is, ah, it's for certain that the traumatized client is often saying no. That's, that's very difficult for me. And so we wanna say that there is this inability to experience positive affect, joy, pleasure, triumph. But not only that, it's when the good things happen and sometimes even for the traumatized person good things happen, but it's this inability to accept that, it's the inability to feel good when good things happen, it's feeling bad when I should be feeling good about something, okay. We call that hedonic negative affect of interference, and what do we mean by that? You know, when positive events happen do you experience numbness. You can't feel the emotions or feelings. You feel out of touch with your emotional response detach, separated, disconnected. You might experience anxiety fear or panic, guilts, self-criticism, shame, humiliation, a disgust response even, empty, lifeless inside, purposely attempting to suppress those positive feelings. These are the kinds of statements that the traumatized person is saying, absolutely this is what I experienced when good things happen. You know, I think this will be a little more grounded if we provide some, ah, examples, you know, what kinds of good things what-- might we be talking about. We might, ah, sit, be sitting watching a beautiful sunset and untouched part of the world. What would you experience? Joy, pleasure versus, you know, all these, you know, bad feelings. And what I would say is, in this particular example, this wouldn't be a really good one that the traumatized person would say, yes, uhm, you know, a disgust for example or anger, it may. But in particular these examples, uhm, how about leaving the house wearing new and attractive clothes and someone gives you a compliment. Paying attention to and how we're feeling the response that if we'd imagine that ourselves. Your partner surprises you with a tender hug tells you no one could, ah, you know, yeah, a better companion or lover, hint, hint, ah, to my wife. Your supervisor gives you unexpected, ah, merit pay increase in recognition for outstanding work, okay, how, how would we feeling, you know, hopefully we would feel pretty good about that, the traumatized person how are they feeling again? Disgust, fear, anxiety, shame, feeling unworthy.

Tim- Vietnam veteran with chronic PTSD Tim (cont.) 

00:18:10
PAUL FREWEN Here's an example of Tim, a Vietnam veteran that we've interviewed with chron-- ah, chronic PTSD. He says, "I think I have a real problem being loved, I feel uncomfortable extremely uncomfortable." When somebody finds out that I served in Vietnam for example when they say, "Thank you for your service," I practically turn inside out with discomfort. The interviewer asked, "When people say thank you what happens? What's it like?" "I guess almost I can say embarrassment from a gut level standpoint." Disembodied awareness, "I can feel it in my gut and my stomach I could feel it in my head too. Everything inside of me screaming no, no, no, and while I developed techniques for saying, you know, you're welcome or at least behaving appropriately and still I, I have this terrible conflict inside. When somebody says, ah, they appreciate anything about me, I have terrible trouble it happens anytime." Someone says, uhm, something like a-- be construed as loving. He goes on, ah, can you give me an example from the interview, terrible problem with birthday, birthday presents, ah, birthday cards, receiving anything, uhm, part of that has something to do with my experience since Vietnam that a part of me that's still dwelling there and unworthiness. Before Vietnam I could experience good feelings but since that it's curtailed. Uhm no longer I feel a part of sort of this idea a-- social detachment here. I feel separate, even though you can't see it and can't be seen from the outside, he says, "I feel soiled internally." And what a terrible feeling, right. "I feel soiled internally that sets me apart from the general population." Physical intimacy outside of sex is really difficult hugging, cuddling stuff like that a mystery. Why that causes me discomfort? Why that is, I'm not sure. If I had to take stop at it, I'd say it's the feeling of being soiled, that's the word I have for describing it once again, it's not so much protecting myself from someone else but it's a more about protecting in this case his wife from him. "I feel that I'm soiled inside and if I'm physically intimate that somehow feel become soiled as well. It feels like the urge to break contact is extremely high, when I have that feeling the longer I have contact the greater of discomfort. I might be able to tolerated for a moment, okay, I'm tolerating it, but little by little it becomes more and more uncomfortable until I have to pull away." 

00:20:40
Study 1 IN PERSON EMOTIONAL ABUSE HISTORY & HDIS (Web Study) EMOTIONAL ABUSE SEXUAL ABUSE 

00:20:45
PAUL FREWEN So just again with the biologist paying attention to me be how you're feeling in response to that quote is terrible, uhm, difficulty is that he's having and many of our, ah, clients are having, uhm, with this questionnaire approach measuring the difficulties experiencing positive and all the negative feelings that can go with the positive events. Uhm, we certainly have been able to show in the number of studies, uhm, traumatized clients indorse these problems much more often that to a non-traumatized clients with or without PTSD but that's been our focused PTSD, and we've also been looking at the neural correlates of these kinds of experiences. The more a person has been able to experience positive emotions during the positive imagery the more they're activating the hor-- orbitofrontal cortex both, ah, hemisphere the left and right you can see over here. And also the anterior cingulate extending into the medial prefrontal and the cerebellar. The more there, uhm, having difficulty that is experiencing negative feelings when they might normally been experiencing positive feelings. The more they're activating this region of the brain the temporal parietal junction in the right hemisphere that's been associated with disembodied cognition that we've been talking a lot about. Also, ah, in the cerebellar is a negative correlation. Positive emotions during the non-social kinds of events again there is this orbitofrontal cortex the more I'm able to experience good feelings as well the more I'm able to experience good feelings the more my insula is activating. As far as, uhm, the more I'm experiencing negative feelings when I, normally might just feeling good, the kinds of events I didn't-- should feel good, uhm, the more the amygdala was activating as well the cerebellum. 

00:22:30
Pleasure, Joy & Triumph LOVING KINDNESS MEDITATION YOGA 

00:22:35
PAUL FREWEN So how do we start to, ah, begin to address these difficulties with pleasure, joy and triumph. There are number of different interventions, you've heard a little bit about this meda-- meditations and the image here is a wishing well, it's really, uhm, just to begin in a very small way, you know, and, uhm, you know, we're not jumping right into that well, right? Uhm, but in very small way trying to get through the therapy, ah, the person to accept just a tiny little bit of sort of good will towards themselves. Okay, uhm, so they may be experiencing something very difficult maybe, ah, may I be able to get through that difficult situation, okay. Uhm, and that's the essence of the loving kindness meditation, self-affirmations that are positive and I would suggest it, uhm, it begin slowly as well as the practice of yoga. And I think, uhm, one probably, ah, point to maybe remind with respect to the practice of mindfulness, often, uhm, it's presented as just be aware of whatever we're aware of. And I think that's fine, and I think that's good, and there's a lot of benefit for that, but I think also what we're after is engendering new experiences as well, right. So we're not just aware of what we're already aware, but we're trying to create something new, we're trying to create a good feeling. So for example in the yoga postures that we work with, uhm, that's what we're really after, and we use imagery for that. So for example just standing in this very simple, uhm, mountain post where-- which is really just, uhm, feed about shoulder with a part standing in the hands can be sort of turned in versus the hands facing out which signifies more of an openness. But why is it called the mountain post? Really because the mountain of course is strong, ah, resilient, you know, it's connected to the earth withstands the elements, stock can be easily blown away. And so as we, ah, you know, stand to the mountain post, we would wanna use some, ah, imagery, that something now just sort of embodied this feeling of being a mountain. You know, can we begin in a, you know, small way in a way that grows overtime and with practice to start to feel more like this strong resilient, you know, unbreakable, unbroken mountain. And that's really what-- I think were, were after. So not just what we're already aware of standing here but to sort of create something a new, maybe this, this feeling of being a mountain that wasn't there before. Again, uhm, here is just another intervention and I like to introduce, ah, Maria through the, through this intervention mindful and metta moments diaries that we use. Trying to develop compassionate self-awareness. And we use this acronym in the palm of your hands and, ah, you know, P stands for present, and so what we're doing here is, you know, we're really providing a language with any therapy it's, it's sort of a language, sort of persons learning. A new way to orient towards our experience. They don't have these concept, we're bringing this concepts to life in the sense of applying not just learning in an academic way but applying this concept to the persons daily life, you know, to make a meaningful change. So this concept of present is both awareness of the present, orienting towards the present, sort of being the present, more so than the past but also, uhm, recognizing the influence of the past. So in this moment, in-- is the way that I'm resu-- responding is the way that I'm reacting, more something, more a matter of responding as if it's in the past than if it's in the present. We'll have lot of examples of this as we go through. So practicing awareness, this would just be again that I can be aware, that I am awake. And this can combat this automatic pilot, this mindlessness, this mind wondering that might, ah, people might be experiencing. As well as the dissociative symptoms which are really, we might define dissociation as not really being aware. Right, checking out, I'm no longer aware, because I can't be aware it's intolerable, it's too scary, it's too shameful, etcetera. The L stands for label then let go. Again, our traumatized clent-- clients, they are often alexithymic, they don't have the words to describe their feelings. So we're starting to help them with that when the bell sounds what was it that I was aware of? And we provide a little bit of a language, we provide some noting and some terms, helping a person understand their experience but with the difficult experiences we wanna let them, you know, try and cultivate this letting go. And we distinguish this from sort of, ah, a fighting against or a suppression, you know, it's a gentle movement this, this kind of like blowing away just allowing it pass on its own time and we had some great examples from the prisoners who developed the, ah, the capacity for mindfulness in the first, ah, presentation this morning. And finally, ah, metta, I can be kind, I can have compassion for myself, were beginning to develop this. And so we'd say this first three terms, presence, awareness, labeling then letting go, those are really the mindfulness but we don't wanna miss out, ah, and omit the metta just really what I like to say. A few more concepts that we sort of try to teach centering. This would be that for example in this lighter version, I wanna feel something but I'm feeling too far away, I'm feeling outside of it. I'd love to feel a little bit of a sense of joy with that complement thank you for your service, or a little bit of sense of pride with that thank you for your service but I can't. It's-- I just-- I can't go there. We are starting to, uhm, in the therapy, move towards that. Why to feel less numb to try and experience those desire of positive feelings. But then there might be, you know, a very difficult de-- say of distress, or shame, or guilt and we're just feeling that too strongly this is a bad feeling, we wanna sort of step away a little bit from that, right? So we wanna step back through decentering but we wanna maintain awareness and as we maintain awareness from a little bit of a decentered perspective, then we, ah, we can sort of wait out until this, this feelings cools off a little bit as little less distressing. To feel less aroused by unwanted negative feelings. But the difference between the, in each case decentering from avoidance and dissociation and decentering we remain present, we take a little bit of step back but we're still here. In comparison with avoidance where we reject the present we're just not gonna go there at all that's not gonna be part of my experience. Uhm, or dissociation where we effectively sort of leave the present we're no longer aware of it. Finally, we teach the concepts of acceptance and change. Why do we want that? We wanna accept what's real and sort of a fact based, you know, we wanna start to realize maybe what has happened and, and accept that, that did happen but we also wanna of course change what we can. And in each case I think change and acceptance are opposite to avoidance where we could sort of draw that as sort of a blanket that see-through. We can try and not feel something but if we're feeling it, you know, we are feeling it and we're not gonna be able to avoid that, we have experienced trauma, we can avoid that, we don't wanna ex-- ah, accept for example that, this should have been the case, but we may accept that it was the case and we start to begin to, uhm, heal from that. 

00:30:30
Summary •Present •Aware •Label, then Let-go •Metta •Centering •Decentering •Acceptance & Change Case Study: Maria Diagnostic •GAF • No previous mental health treatment Trauma History 

00:30:35
PAUL FREWEN So to summarize these are the sort of the concepts that we like to, ah, teach in a therapy present, awareness, labeling that in letting go, metta, centering, decentering and acceptance and change. And again what we'll do with Maria is, uhm, begin to show how we can maybe use those concepts in sort of the teaching through the therapy, ah, and see what, ah, benefit they might have in terms of applying those concepts to my life. So here is Maria she is a 39-year-old, ah, female from Romania she immigrated to Canada in her 20s. Uhm, she had chronic PTSD, moderate to severe, she had various comorbidities, depression, GAD, ah, pain disorder, ah, particularly back pain, migraines. She had a global assessment of function scale of 58 which is moderate, ah, no previous mental health treatments. She did exercise, she practice Yoga for a back pain. She had a trauma history, childhood developmental trauma, childhood physical abuse by her uncles and parents, childhood sexual abuse by an uncle, she was raised in a Romanian orphanage, ah, that is she was abandoned by her mother, ah, during middle age, uhm, and she had a very high childhood questionnaire scores that he might be familiar with. She's also threatened with, ah, by knife as an adult by her mother's husband and adulthood she's raped in age 29, and she went back to her birth place in 2010 to, uhm, start to talk to her family, uhm, and, ah, that was a traumatizing event as well. Just a little quick segway, uhm, we've recently published a sort of a measure that gets a trauma history and I wanna just kinda introduce you to this development of a childhood attachment and relational trauma screen. And this will, ah, be a way just to understand Maria a little bit and what she has been through. Uhm, so what we do with this is we try to have an integrated assessment of early childhood positive relationships, as well as made, maltreatment history. And the difference between our approach, is that it's relationally contextualized and you'll see what I mean by that, ah, as compared to the childhood trauma questionnaire what were just saying, was it true that it was abused, was it true that it was neglected, uhm, we administer this online and we administer it in a way that we understand, ah, the early relationships. Who was the perpetrator, who was the, ah, the person who turned the a, you know, turned the other and, and, ah, neglected and avoided. So we input, ah, our own name as well the reference of family members important life figures, representing with items and we decide which items applied to which people. So as an example for Maria, this is her, ah, you know, her family, Maria, ah, included her mother, her father, brother, uncle C and G and aunt and a stepfather. And as a practice she might be saying, okay, uhm, this person is male and she would basically be clicking on who is male and they would turn red and they are selected, we go on the he next. This person is female that would be these people. So now the kinds of statements that are, ah, measured by these CARTS, I like this person very much that would be a sort of not applicable from Maria, right. While growing up who did I like really there was no one that I like. I love this person, not applicable. This person liked me very much, not applicable. This person loved me, not applicable. I went to this person when I felt mad, sad, scared nobody to go to. All right. This person helped me when I was feeling sad, mad, scared, no one. This person cared about me was proud of me, made me feel calm, happy, made me feel good about myself, nobody. I was happy that this person was in our family, nobody. This person was sad and upset a lot of the time that was dad. Mad, angry a lot of the time. That was dad and uncle C. Scared, worried a lot, that was mom and me. Made me feel sad and upset, that was mom, dad and uncle C. Made me feel scared worried, the same. Made me feel mad, angry, she really didn't really feel that way. Made me feel bad about myself, dad and uncle C. I thought this person didn't like or love me, dad, uncle C. Wished I was not in our family, the same. Hated me, the same. Slap, smacked, hit me that was mom, dad, uncle C. Punched, kicked me, dad, uncle C. Did bad things to me that I wasn't supposed to tell other people about, there was uncle G. Made me do bad things that I wasn't supposed to tell other people about, also uncle G. So with this, uhm, maybe can just sort of begin to appreciate the kind of story that, uhm, this particular survey gives you in terms of the history, uhm, and what I wanna say is we wanna do this with kids as well of course cuz we, we have the same items but its present tense. This person slaps, smacks, hits, and we can, ah, assess this, uhm, and the kids and hopefully we can have this be, ah, preventative measure or an early intervention measure. Uhm, but as it stands, it's a retrospective measuring and we got a history.

CARTS-Mean Comparisons (n=122)

PAUL FREWEN So I think you, you have a sense of what, uhm, Maria has gone through, and just to kinda give a sense of, a kinds of, uhm, oh, and sort of data that you can get from the CARTS. Moms versus dads across participants how they differ, you know, moms tends to be given the positive items, the secure items, uhm, you know, more often even the negative affects item. More often than dads, whereas dads, are more emotionally abusive to others on average. Physically abusive to others on average, do more bad things and explicitly, ah, are more involved and more childhood sexual abuse. Also in the same sample we can look at associations. How much I feel sad, mad, and scared, that is I felt when I was growing up versus how much had mom helped me when I felt those same feelings? How much that dad helped me when I felt those same feelings? And we could see this relationship, and of course as we predict, ah, you know, the more that mom was able to help, the more that dad was able to help, the less I was feeling those, those feelings when I was growing up. So that just gives you, ah, a little bit of a, a sense of, uhm, that particular assessment procedure. Coming back to our concepts of mindfulness and, ah, metta, centering, decentering acceptance and change, what we're doing here, and what I'd like to say, is this isn't actually the therapy, this is pretty much done in background. I introduce this concept, uhm, and Maria is just working on this on her own and, and every so often will, will, you know, have an example in therapy and she wanna share some of this work. But it's early on, you know, uhm, we introduce this we, we give her the definitions, you know, what's this about. Another bell, and from there though she di-- she kinda does this work in the background so, what I wanna say is this isn't taking up session time this is work she is doing in between sessions. An objective event, this is actual mater-- this is word for word what, ah, Maria has written. So, an example event, feeling to stop at a stop sign and being pulled over. What was the feeling like? Heart racing, flushed face, panic, anger, the thought, "You idiot, you should have sto-- ah, you should run the stop sign, now you're gonna be late for work, uhm, you're gonna get a ticket." Practicing presents then, it's only a ticket you're safe, the policeman will not beat you up. This is a sign of the, in-- recognizing the influence of the past and the present. Getting beat up was really seeing the policeman as her father, or as uncle C. Right, and she can now begin to be aware of that. Awareness, I'm aware of my reaction, I'm aware of my fear and anger, and then my car, my driver's seat, I could feel my hands on the wheel, I can hear the signal beeping, you know, mindful. Okay, labeling then letting go, these are self-critical thoughts, that rooted in the past see if I can let them pass. Metta taking a deep breathe, relaxing, you are safe. Decentering, when I distance myself I can see that no one is gonna get beat up for, uhm, my not stopping. I might not gonna get beat up. My fear comes from the past, accept that I might get a ticket, plan to explain why I didn't stop. So just one example and I'd like to go through a few in terms of this particular intervention mindful metta moments diaries, how this might, ah, be useful in, in the therapy. So another example, a memory of being slapped at age 9 coming up by my dad. While working on elliptical, ah, machine at the gym. Erratic heart rate, flushed face, tightening of fist, neck and jaw muscles feelings of anger and rage, not fear. I can smell stale garlic, sort of a flashback, right. I'm on an elliptical machine reminding oneself of the present, you know where I am, I'm working out, I feel good working out, he can't hurt me here. I'm in Canada, he is, you know, overseas. I'm aware of this anger, aware of this, uhm, event. I'm aware of where I am, listening to my iPod watching TV. This is anger directed for ma-- my father and myself for not causing him pain then, she recognizes that process. Let it go, pain will not make him learn, they'll only make me miserable. I'm safe, she begins to, to cry, tears, I am safe she reminds herself again. Everyday I'm better and better in every way. The memory is still vivid but when I distance myself from it, I can realize that it's just that a memory. Playing it over and over in my head isn't happening. He got what he deserved. I accept that it might come with only if, ah, you know, time to time this memory will comeback. I just need to, ah, classify as a memory and not waste any energy on it. Now I, I found this one fun and it's, it's just that, this doesn't have to only be employed during, ah, distressing times. Right, as, ah, Jon Kabat-Zinn has really talked about, uhm, it's-- it can be employed while standing at the bus stop, while washing dishes, etcetera. The objective event was doing housework in this case, and, uhm, I mentioned my wife is in the, in the audience I wonder if she's gonna take notes here. Doing housework a feeling of cleanliness, a feeling fresh, clean, pure, it feels good to throw things out, I'm cleaning my house. I enjoy doing housework. I can feel the vacuum, the motors reverberations. I'm aware this is a good feeling every house needs cleaning, this is happiness, creating and, I didn't make this up, this is, this is Maria, okay. Listen, I hold on to this feeling, I have everything I want, need with... 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN What's suggested in the scale? 

00:43:05
PAUL FREWEN Yeah, this was actually, yeah, I might tried hypnosis. With every stroke of the vacuum, every sweep of the duster, every s-- mop of the floor I feel better. I rallies this feeling. I am reminded, uhm, that my time is running out but maybe this, ah... 

00:43:25
UNKNOWN This was a joke, right? 

00:43:25
PAUL FREWEN This was not a joke. 

00:43:30
UNKNOWN Oh, it's cool. 

00:43:30
PAUL FREWEN And this is very, ah, this is very early in therapy. What I wanna do is, uhm, I do wanna skip just one more example there. But maybe that would be the, the beginnings of, some of those feelings of joy and triumph that we were after, right. I just wanna show one more, ah, therapeutic example that was, uhm, given. Beginning a meditation. She's focusing on her back pain, present, she says, I'm convinced that my back pain, in fact all the physical pain in my body has something to do with a trauma. All the feelings I have for those that have hurt me. I have known this for a while I just didn't know what to do about it. Practicing awareness, she says, I'm aware that I can only heal by dealing with the past, I need to somehow deal with the anger, rage, hate, aggressive and hostile thoughts, guilt, shame, powerlessness, resentment. I'm aware that I'm annoyed and fatigued by all these feelings. I start practicing the meditation we did last session which was a metta-meditation. I send good thoughts to myself, to my partner and now she says a sort of spontaneous, sort of emergent, why not someone I hate my father. So she wants to try this out. Labeling then letting go, I focused on sending him understanding compassion, patience, forgiveness. Yes, I mean forgiveness of him, himself and suddenly I see his face, I calm by breathing, I try my hardest to stay focused, I cupped my hands around my face and peer deeply into his eyes, look into his soul. I see regret, shame, pain, sadness, I remember that he always had a self-pitiful expression on his face but this time he's looking back at me. Centering, decentering, when I ended the meditation session I felt nauseated and somewhat ill, it must be what purging feel likes. But I also felt calm and good about myself like when you've done a good deed. Metta, the power to heal is within me, she writes, the piece I so crave is within my grasp. Acceptance and change, even though I still winced at the thought of him, I think I'm on the right track. I asked myself the entire day how I felt about the experience, I feel satisfied somehow. This was her final entry, a memory of her mom returning home after being on a date with her molester. She was so terribly dunked she collapsed on the floor, I was terrified of what my dad would do if he came in walking, finding her this way. I was pleading with her to get up and get to bed, I hear the key in the lock and I know it's my father, I'm shaking, I'm so afraid, I don't know what happens next, perhaps a dissociative episode, she has never accessed to that or the rest of that memory. I think a terrible beating. I hate that I'm crying writing, as she works this through. My heart rates up, jaws clenched deliberately trying to keep writing, stop crying, I feel the vile rising in my throat. I resent her for putting me through this, presents, taking a deep breathe, coming back to the present. I'm in my beautiful house, I'm not in the past. Awareness, I'm aware of my surroundings, I listen to the squeak of the dryer, I hear the TV, I feel the floor. Labeling then letting go of resentment, hurt, wronged I was pained, still fear hearing the key and the door lock. I try and let those go, I know they don't belong with me anymore but they cling to me like burst to a dog. I know I'm strong the practice of metta, I need to remember that I am strong, I am a survivor, this is the end of our meditation and my presentation. Against all odds I am normal, peace be upon my soul, centering, decentering I try and leave the negative feelings behind, I try and focus on being normal and strong. Acceptance and change, she writes that might be with time. This is to show how she changed on PTSD symptoms across time that was the end of treatment. And, uhm, overtime she sustained those improvements so I'd really say what she has done here is quite remarkable but I really emphasize it's not me, she's been doing all this work that you've been seeing in the background. Uhm, and so that's Maria and I thank you, ah, for your attention.
