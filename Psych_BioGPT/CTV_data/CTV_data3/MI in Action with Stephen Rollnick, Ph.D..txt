1. A Puzzle: encouraging change in others 

00:00:00
2. Unpacking the troubles 

00:00:00
3. Motivational interviewing 

00:00:00
You would think that… 

00:00:00
Hangovers, dissolving marriage, memory blackouts and serious problems at work would be enough to convince a woman to stop drinking 

00:00:00
The very real threats of blindness, amputations and kidney failure from diabetes would be enough to motivate weight loss and glycemic control 

00:00:00
a question 

00:00:00
Does your attitude make a difference? 

00:00:00
What goggles do you wear?

"Treating Substance Abuse & Mental Health Disorders" 

00:00:00
MI won't get off the ground with if you wear "deficit goggles". 

00:00:00
It is strength-based, focused on people, and avoids labels 

00:00:00
Unpacking the troubles 

00:00:00
Let's meet a client called "Helen" 

00:00:00
Helen is leaning against the school gates, panting 

00:00:00
Does a direct approach trigger change?

A demonstration 

00:00:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Good morning to you and welcome to this 90-minute seminar called "MI in Action, Treating Substance Abuse and Mental Health Disorders." My name is Stephan Rollnick, and I'm going to be with you for the next hour-and-a-half and what I hope will be an enjoyable ride for you. Perhaps, let's think about a boat ride rather than a car ride. And I hope it'll be a smooth and enjoyable one for all of us. We might hit some rocks here and there, but that's what happens in clinic practice anyway. And so, we'll deal with that as we go along. My primary aim now is to teach you about motivational interviewing, not how to do it. That's another journey for you, but I do hope that I stimulate you to head out there to reflect about the conversations that you have to practice, changing the way you speak with people and ideally get some support from a coach or supervisor or a trainer. But my task today is to give you a good feel for the spirit and practice of MI. And wisely or not, which is why we call this "MI in Action," I'll be diving into some practice with the help of an actor called Janine, who's a colleague of mine, and she's sitting to the one side and you'll, you'll meet her in a moment. And hopefully, Janine and I will, will dive in and reflect about our victories and disasters afterwards and we're hoping that the combination of lecture material and illustrated with practice sessions will turn this into a dynamic and enjoyable boat ride for you. So off we go and using the image of, of water here on this next slide, you'll see a picture of my little son and, his name is Nathan, and there's a story behind this which is well worth using as an introduction to this workshop. This is in France last summer, age two, one his own, unable to swim, adults sitting around. And this beautiful little boy is walking backwards very gently into water that feels a little bit cold. What he is facing is the prospect of change. And I think if we had to find one word for how he feels about this, it's ambivalent. And that's a concept that we're going to looking at when we turn to issues like substance abuse and mental health disorders. The boy is feeling ambivalent about going into that pool for a wide range of reasons and we're sitting around and watching him. And I'll tell you the story about what happened in a moment. But a really useful question here is what is going to help this little one be comfortable enough and bold enough to go into the water? What's going to help him change? Now on the next slide, you'll see one approach to this. Here you can see me in front of him, begging and beseeching him to change, okay? You'll see a friend of mine, a Greek friend of mine, pointing to the other adults to keep well out the way because little Nathan's coming in. You'll see her daughter standing there with her hands on her hand saying, "This is absolutely hopeless. These grown ups are going to get nowhere." And you'll see little Nathan just looking at dad and he's… What's coming up written across the top of his forehead is "No," okay? And so we failed to get him into the water. And the question is what position and relationship between me and this boy would have been best to encourage him to go in the water? I'll ask you what would have happened if I'd gone behind him. I think you might agree that he would feel frightened that I was going to push him. And so that either going in front of someone and trying to beseech them to change or going behind them and trying to push them to change, crates very recognizable and universal feelings inside us. And so, the position that would have probably been the most helpful, I'm sure you've guessed it already, is alongside him… Being his guide, offering him support if he wanted to, but giving him the security of a comforting presence next to him as he faces change. And in one sense, that's a metaphor for the whole of MI. So I thought I'd show you that little vignette to begin with. And here on this next is the same boy with the founder of motivational interviewing. And that's Will Miller, taken just a few weeks beforehand. And I wanted to introduce you to Will Miller because he really, not me, is the person who had the original idea behind motivational interviewing. Okay, so what are we gonna cover today? I'll talk briefly about this puzzle of how you encourage change in other people, and we can think back to little Nathan when we do that. I'll then turn to unpacking the very common conversational troubles that arise when you try and talk to someone about change. And we'll spend the most of our time on the third topic, which is motivational interviewing. But to begin with, this puzzle of encouraging change in other people, I think it's, it's possibly a bit of a fatuous and, and an unnecessary thing to say, but isn't this the problem, which is that we can't make people change, only they can. And so the question is, what can we do to make a difference? And I think it's very common for us in our frustration facing people who we feel should change to think, "Oh, please, surely, you can see the reason why you should change." And here on these next slides are a couple of examples. Hangovers, dissolving marriage, memory blackouts and serious problems at work… Now surely you'd think that would be enough to convince a woman to stop drinking. Could well be quite similar to the case of Helen that Janine's gonna play for us today. Another example, and this comes from healthcare, but you can see how universal it is. Here you face people who, who, who could become blind, have a limb amputated, face kidney failure from their diabetes, you'd think that would be enough to motivate them to lose weight and to gain better glycemic control. Yet the clinics are riddled with people who fail to change their behavior, and practitioners like us who wonder what on earth is going on. And then there is another one, which is about the incredible puzzle of people being in dehumanizing prison environments and that apparently is not enough to make them want to never go back there and change their behavior. Okay, so a question we could ask right at the beginning is, does our attitude make a difference to helping someone change? And I've used this metaphor about goggles, which I quite like because it implies that you can change the goggles you are wearing, or indeed, it can also imply that your goggles are becoming a bit misty and you're not really seeing it the right way. And I thought I would show you a contrast between two descriptions of the case of Helen that we're going to be dealing with and I'm going to ask you now to only focus on the first of this. So the slide will contain two paragraphs, but I want you to read just the first paragraph with me now because I want to ask you some questions about it, okay? So here it is. The primary problem is alcohol dependence and acrophobia with panic attacks in a 46-year-old female married for 23 years. Infertile, two adopted young sons. One is diagnosed with ADD. Both have behavioral problems at school, and marriage is not going well. My question to you is how does it make you feel if you were about to see someone like that? What if I put it to you that you might see three people like that in a row? I imagine that the unifying emotion that we are experiencing when we look at something like that is a heart sink of some kind. And, and a heart sink because of the weight of the problems that we are about to be confronted with. And that's something that will affect the way we feel and the way we behave towards this person, okay? Now I'd like to present to you a second paragraph which describes the same person. Have a look at this one. Helen's 46 and she married Dave 23 years ago. They've got a good circle of friends and a love of ballroom dancing. And they tried to have kids, adopted the two boys eventually. And Helen, umm… keeps the household going efficiently and takes pride in getting the boys organized and to school on time. And it's been a rough ride for her. They, they are struggling at school. Her drinking's increased, especially when she noticed how it calmed her down when she felt panicky as they were about to go to school. Dave's very frustrated about the situation. Now, how do you feel about seeing Helen, someone like that? And I think the contrast between these two accounts highlights the fact that you probably feel better about seeing the second person, a human being, than you did about the first which is a list of, of problems and pathologies. And so there's a serious point here, which is that, umm… unless you see, are wearing the goggles that focus on people as whole human beings with strengths, it's very difficult for MI to get off the ground. If you just view people as having deficits, it's going to be hard for you to learn MI and appreciate the kind of work that I'm going to try and demonstrate here today. So this is a fundamental platform for motivational interviewing. And so perhaps in the next slide, if I could just allude to the subtitle of this seminar, Treating Substance Abuse and Mental Health Disorders, actually that description has been produced by someone wearing deficit goggles. And MI won't get off the ground under these circumstances. MI is strength-based is focused on people and avoids labels. So I will perhaps towards the end of this seminar reconstruct that subtitle for you and show you how it's possible to talk about things like substance abuse and mental health issues without using that kind of pathology orientated label. Now, okay, I'm going to move on to the second one which is second part of this seminar, which is unpacking the troubles. 

00:11:35
[sil.] 

00:11:40
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And I thought it might be time, good time to meet Helen. And on the next slide here… This is the scenario, okay? I'm going to read it for you in case there's people with, with vision difficulties. Helen is leaning against the school gates, panting. A teaches notices her. She says, "What's up?" And Helen says she can't breathe. The teacher thinks, "Hang on, this woman is wobbly, I think she's probably drunk." Helen's husband leaves the house early, did so today, and says she should pull her socks up. The two boys are just very hard work for her. Yesterday, one of them nearly got run over on the way to school. He's over overactive and they fight all the time. These are two adopted kids, right? A drink is about the only way that Helen feels she can cope with her panic and get to school. So that's a very typical mental health/substance abuse scenario. And what I like about this case is it could be seen just about anywhere. She could be sent to accidents and emergency, as the teacher who thought she was having a heart attack. She could have gone to a primary care consultation. She could have gone to see a social worker who might have been an access by the teacher at the school. She could have gone to a mental community, mental health counselor. She could have gone to an addiction counselor and so on. And so across all these settings, we see people with multiple interrelated problems like this. On this occasion, I thought and I discussed this with Janine, lets' make me, Steve, umm… a school counselor. So that the teacher was quite smart and thought, "Well, we've got a counselor in the building. Let me go and speak to this counselor." Went to see the counselor, who said, "Well, I'm about to go to a meeting, but I could give this woman 20 minutes." And that's the scenario that we're going to demonstrate in a moment, okay? Sorry, the slides went back to the beginning and I'll just catch up for us. 

00:13:50
[sil.] 

00:13:55
STEPHAN ROLLNICK So the question we're gonna ask now on the very first demonstration, and this is what I mean by "unpacking the troubles of behavior change conversation," is does persuasion trigger change? Because that's the most commonsensical approach. You see a problem and you want to try and solve it for someone. And this was, was the starting point for motivational interviewing in the early 1980s. And I'll say a bit more about the history a little bit later, okay? But the, the starting point for this kind of direct persuasive approach is, I see clients, they've got problems, I've got deficit goggles on. They've got problems. I help them solve those problems. And so, that's what I'm going to demonstrate now, gonna grab a sip of water and I'm gonna introduce you to, to Helen. Why don't you come and sit down, please. So this is Janine and she's going to take the case of Helen. We have done very, very little rehearsal. We wanted to try and keep this as spontaneous as possible. And what we're gonna do afterwards, after each brief demos, I'll just have a little debrief. So I'm going to give her a moment to get into the role and I'm going to have a sip of some of my pure Welsh water. 

00:15:10
[sil.] 

00:15:15
STEPHAN ROLLNICK 'Cause that's where I'm talking to you from, it's in Cardiff, Wales in the United Kingdom. Okay. So I'm going to see what happens if I use a direct persuasive approach with Helen, and I'm going to assume if that's okay with you, that we're 15 minutes, 20 minutes into a conversation with Helen on the school gates and I'm going to put my expert hat on, my deficit goggles on, and off I go. Okay? 

00:15:40
[sil.] 

00:15:45
STEPHAN ROLLNICK So, Helen, thinking about your alcohol and your drinking, I'm just wondering, can, can you see that this is getting you into a little bit of trouble here, that there might be a little bit of a vicious circle? 

00:15:55
HELEN I'm fine. 

00:16:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK You, you feel okay. 

00:16:00
HELEN Yeah. 

00:16:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah. 

00:16:00
HELEN Yeah. 

00:16:05
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And, you know, in the mornings when you, when you take that drink, umm… how does it make you feel? 

00:16:10
HELEN Good. 

00:16:10
STEPHAN ROLLNICK The drink makes you feel good? 

00:16:10
HELEN Yeah. 

00:16:15
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And helps you to get out of the house? 

00:16:15
HELEN Helps me to get out of the house, yeah. I need it. 

00:16:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Can you see that that can become a vicious circle in which the more you that in the mornings and the more likely you are to carry on drinking? 

00:16:30
HELEN I… I don't know. I'll just cross that bridge when I come to it. At the moment, he's absolutely fine. 

00:16:35
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right, right. But can you tell me, what's your understanding of it then? 

00:16:40
HELEN It helps me with my… I have problems with my panic, panicking, and it helps me. 

00:16:45
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Mm-hmm. And, and can you see where that might lead? 

00:16:50
HELEN You know, I'm taking each day as it comes at the moment. 

00:16:55
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right, right, right. 

00:16:55
HELEN Okay. And that's fine. I'm absolutely fine. 

00:17:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right. Can you tell me are you, umm… Are you feeling a bit shaky when you wake up in the morning? 

00:17:05
HELEN Yes, yes. 

00:17:05
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Oh, yeah? Yeah? 

00:17:05
HELEN A little bit. 

00:17:10
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And, umm… how much are you drinking the night before, sort of on an average night. Could you tell me how much you are drinking? 

00:17:15
HELEN I don't know. I don't count. Not, not huge. Well, I don't know. 

00:17:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right, right. 

00:17:20
HELEN It's, it's okay. It's all right. 

00:17:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK How long have you been drinking, Helen? 

00:17:25
[sil.] 

00:17:30
HELEN I, I… I like a glass of wine with my husband. 

00:17:30
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right, right, right 

00:17:30
HELEN After we do that, you know… Since we've been married, we come home from work. When we come home from work, we have a drink. 

00:17:40
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right, right. And can you see that if that escalates, it can get to a point where it's actually withdrawal symptoms that you're feeling first thing in the morning. Can you see that? 

00:17:50
HELEN No. I have… 

00:17:50
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Do you recognize anything in that, in what I'm saying to you? 

00:17:55
HELEN I don't think about it. I don't think about it. At the moment, I don't think about it. 

00:18:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right. And now that you're sitting with me here this is morning, umm… and, I'm concerned about your drinking and what this might mean for looking after the two boys. 

00:18:10
HELEN Hang on a minute. I know they're my boys and I know what… I know how to look after them. 

00:18:15
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right. 

00:18:15
HELEN You don't need to tell me that. I'm sorry, but I don't want to know that. 

00:18:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Okay. I think I'll stop there, I'll stop there. I found it tough and as you could see, I used some quite good counseling skills in a couple of places, but I found that extremely tough. But I think let's ask Helen, let's ask Helen to step out of role to become Janine. Janine, how was your experience of that? 

00:18:45
JANINE Umm… I think I found, umm… perhaps you were telling me a few home truths, I don't know. It was something that was on in the back of my mind that I think about, but I only think about and I don't, I felt like I don't want anyone else to tell me that. I don't need to know that. I'm taking each day as it comes. 

00:19:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right, right. 

00:19:00
JANINE I want to forget all about that at the moment. I don't want to know. 

00:19:05
STEPHAN ROLLNICK So in a way, you were minimizing the extent of the problem to me. 

00:19:10
JANINE Yes, yeah. 

00:19:10
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Why were you doing that? 

00:19:15
JANINE Because it's my problem and I want to… It's my problem that I've not talked about to anyone before. 

00:19:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK The way I see it, you were feeling a little bit, you were feeling a little bit threatened there. 

00:19:25
JANINE Yes, a little bit. Yes, defen… Yeah. 

00:19:25
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Defensive? 

00:19:25
JANINE Defensive, yes. Yeah. 

00:19:30
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And can you… Could you, could you articulate what might have made that easy for you given that you were feeling ashamed of it? 

00:19:35
JANINE What would have made it easier for me because I was ashamed of it? Umm… I don't know. I guess, maybe a bit of under… understanding maybe or beginning to step into my shoes, maybe. I don't know, really. 

00:20:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Okay. I mean, those are some of the things that we might experiment with later, but it just struck me that I could have made things a lot, a lot worse there by saying to Helen, like I want to Oscar to, to listen to this one, I think, the issue we've got here is that you could have quiet a serious drinking problem and I need to be honest with you about that. I think you've got quite a serious drinking problem. The question is how can we help you face that and give you the support to do something about it? Can you see what I mean? That's going to just produce further defensive reactions, was that I've used the label of a drinking problem, which was actually quiet mild because in many contexts in the United States, the world "alcoholic" would be used. That's for sure. And probably with a message about abstinence, which would have gone something like, "And really that means that the goal we've got to pursue is to stop drinking completely." And you could see the defensiveness will only increase. And so I'm gonna ask Janine to leave. Thank you so much, Janine. 

00:20:55
JANINE Thank you. 

00:21:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Any other comments? 

00:21:00
JANINE I just want to say when you mentioned my children, I got very defensive. 

00:21:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK I noticed that. 

00:21:05
JANINE Yes. 

00:21:05
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah. 

00:21:05
JANINE Because that hit reality, the home to that, oh, my goodness, my children. 

00:21:10
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah. 

00:21:10
JANINE I have to have my children. I don't… 

00:21:10
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah, yeah. 

00:21:15
JANINE The way you were talking to me that you want… You were going to tell somebody to take them away or… 

00:21:15
STEPHAN ROLLNICK So that's when you felt most threatened by my… 

00:21:20
JANINE Yes, definitely, when the subject of the children were brought up. 

00:21:25
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah. It raises a question. Is it possible to bring up the subject of the children without making her feel threatened? That's precisely the home of motivational interviewing and I'm gonna leave that for a later discussion. But let's see if later on I can raise the subject of the children without her feeling threatened. Okay, many thanks to you. Thank you so much, Helen. 

00:21:40
JANINE Thanks. Thank you?

You don't have to make change happen

You can't

You don't have to come up with all the answers 

00:21:45
You probably don't have the best ones

You're not wrestling with patients 

00:21:45
You're dancing 

00:21:45
How do people change? 

00:21:45
We have inside us our own good reasons to change, and much of the strength to make it happen

Today 

00:21:45
1. A puzzle: encouraging change in others 

00:21:45
2. Unpacking the troubles 

00:21:45
3. Motivational interviewing 

00:21:45
STEPHAN ROLLNICK I mean, Janine. Sorry. Okay. I think what I was trying to illustrate there was that if I adopt an expert position and use what I've termed "the righting reflex," see a problem, solve it. When someone is feeling very ambivalent about something, and my assumption is that a little bit like my little boy, Helen's feeling trapped. Helen's not sure which way to go with her drinking. But when the righting reflex meets ambivalence, the outcome is trouble and dysfunction, and that's the danger behind using a direct and persuasive approach when someone's uncertain about change and provides a rationale for MI or motivational interviewing. Now on this next slide is a description of three communication styles which I developed with a group of nurses. And I'll just share this with you here in this seminar. Have a look at afterwards. The logic here is that these styles, Direct, Guide and Follow are used naturally by people, forget about helpers and counselors and practitioners, they are used naturally by all of us in helping other people. And they each have a place. The style I was using a moment ago, is that fairly obvious what it was? It was direct. And a directing style is very functional and useful in some circumstance but not others. So if somebody knocks on your window of your car, and says, "Can you, can you help me find something"? Blah-blah-blah… to use a directing style is exactly what you want to do. The problem is that you are using a directing style when someone's facing behavior change, you can run into trouble. And that's what I was trying to illustrate, okay? And our conclusion is that the style that is probably best for helping someone with behavior change is guiding. So on the one hand, directing is quite forceful in problem or… and I solve the problem for you as the expert, following is, I just follow wherever you want go. And if somebody's upset, it's a very functional way to behave. Guiding takes the best of both of these and is very well observed by high quality teachers, priests, sports coaches. So these skills that we already have in us, hence the coming along the side reference with a little boy as his guide. And MI really just takes that fundamental guiding style and refines some of the conversational skills involved. So in that sense, MI is not new because you will recognize it in the operation of, of a guiding style. What I've got in the next few slides are two smoking cessation consultations, the second of which is MI-consistent. I'm not going to go through them, but I thought I'd include them in the slide pack for you to study. What they tell us is that MI doesn't have to take any longer than any other approach. So that's why I've produced these two scripts that are exactly the same length, but with quite divergent outcomes. In the second one, you'll see once you finish the seminar, in what way this is characteristic of motivational interviewing. And I guess the point here when we try and unpack the troubles is that you don't have to make change happen in someone else, because you can't. That's the difficulty. And you don't have to come up with all the answers because they probably have got the best ones. And as you noticed a moment ago, you ideally do not want to wrestle with somebody, you rather want to dance, and that's a metaphor for everything to follow in the rest of this seminar. 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:50
STEPHAN ROLLNICK So MI is based on the idea that we have inside us our own good reasons to change. It's how we draw out someone's motivation to change that could improve outcomes. Okay. So I'm going to turn now to motivational interviewing for the next 55 minutes. I'm going to grab a quick sip of water if you don't mind. 

00:26:15

00:26:20
The SPIRIT OF MI 

00:26:20
Definition 

00:26:20
- a person-centered, a goal oriented counseling style for addressing the common problem of ambivalence about change 

00:26:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK I'd like to start with something we call "The spirit of MI." MI is not something done to or on someone. It's something done with or on their behalf. That distinction is quite important. It's not a set of techniques for getting someone to do something they wouldn't otherwise want to do. It's something done with them. And this is well carried, captured by the four elements of the spirit that we've integrated into the latest addition of our text on motivational interviewing. And here they are. And I want to make a couple of points about this. You'll notice compassion, and we've put the word "compassion" into the spirit of MI. That's to capture the need to not manipulate people and emphasize that it's your, comp… It's your use of compassion with somebody like Helen that's going to make a big difference. So we're not trying to manipulate her to stop drinking. And she'll sense that. The moment she feels a lack of compassion, she'll sense it straightaway. Something else to point out about this is if you look at the top three, you'll recognize them. In one sense, they come from client-centered counseling. In one sense, they capture what helpfulness is. It's the fourth one down the bottom that is, I think, the unique contribution of MI. So in this sense, motivational interviewing is helpfulness, 80 percent helpfulness that we all recognize, but this 20 percent which is unique to MI, which is what we call evocation. In one very quick strapline, evocation is the skill that I used to draw out from Helen her own good reasons to change. The conversational skills I used to encourage Helen to say why and how she might change. I'll be emphasizing that a lot, but I wanted to point this out. MI is 80 percent helpfulness, 20 percent something a bit different. Okay? Here's a definition of MI.

Summary 

00:28:50
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And these are the core skills involved. If you like, if you think about the metaphor of a dance, the spirit describes the form and feel of the dance. The skill is a bit like the dance steps that you take, the technical dance steps. That you couldn't, if you think of something like a tango, you couldn't have one with the other. And it's quite a hard task that I've got this afternoon or you would have it if I asked you to describe what a tango is in words without ever being able to hear it, or like with MI, without being able to really see it and feel it and be in it. And so the dancing analogy is quite a good one. And what I'm going to be doing now is describing some of these dance steps. Then I'm going to, to, to move away from the detail and ask the question, what, for what purpose are these dance steps used. And I'm going to turn to the concept of, of evocation inevitably, okay? So this is just to let you know where we're going to go the next five, seven minutes. I'm gonna talk about each of these core skills. These are basic counseling skills, but they are used in a purposeful way in MI, that is really important. Okay, so you can read about these, and so I'm not going to touch on anything but what I feel is the essence, okay? Can I assume that you all know what an open question is, uh, that was a trick because that was a close question, umm… that's something with only a yes or no answer. So, open question is something that encourages someone to tell their story or to expand upon whatever it is you are asking them about. The shorter, the better. Words like why, how, are the sort of openings for an open question. I found many years of clinical practice that the shorter my open questions, the better. You'll also notice I might be speaking sometimes a little bit slowly here. That's actually quite deliberate, because I want to emphasize that the pacing of a conversation about change in MI has got this quality of being a little bit slowed down and it has gravitas about it, because if there's the kind of space that I'm illustrating now, I've got the time to think about a really good open question. If I'm going really fast like this and I'm talking to you and I'm going through the skills of motivational interviewing, and next one I'm going to be dealing with is affirmation. Now I'm taking a deep breathe and now I'm going to describe affirmation to you. Can you see it? I don't have time to think. And I suspect you don't have time to reflect. And so if I'm doing well with Helen, which is not going to be easy because I'm nervous in front of a camera, the pace will be slowed down so that I can pick a really thoughtful open question and there's breathing space in the conversation between us that gives me a chance to look ahead, think about where she is going, to think about how her relationship is. To consider how I'm feeling, which is very, very important. So I wanted to make that point about pacing. 

00:32:25
[sil.] 

00:32:30
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Affirmation. Umm… there's a big literature on this and there's a possibility it's a lot more powerful than we've given it credit for. The essence of it is this. It's you pointing out to someone their positive qualities and strengths. Now you might see that is a technical matter, but if you are wearing, if you put the deficit goggles to one side and you are putting on the strength goggles, it's a question of noticing. Putting those goggles on and noticing. So it's not just a technique that you use with somebody. You've got the right goggles on, you will notice these strengths in her, even somebody like Helen, and it's a very powerful thing for somebody who is feeling troubled, trapped, ambivalent, downtrodden, depressed, to have someone point out these strengths. You might want to consider what you, what you think about the difference between affirmation and praise. 

00:33:40

00:33:40
Goal of MI 

00:33:40
Quietly clarify ambivalence and elicit change talk 

00:33:40
Change talk: "I am worried about my panic attacks" 

00:33:40
Sustain talk: "All my friends drink, so I'm OK" 

00:33:45
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Praise is offering a judgment of someone. It can be useful, particularly with young people to praise them. But it's a judgment that you make about them. Affirmation is not a judgment, it's a statement about someone's strengths. So that's something to explore in your own clinical practice and indeed in the literature if you'd like to. Okay, now reflection. Umm… we say in the MI field that if you can emit three reflections for every open question, in that sort of proportion, you have the technical competence to do MI to a higher standard. Let's see if I'm capable of doing that this afternoon. And that's quite a thing to say. In other words, these are the down steps and it's a bit like, you can think about it a bit like a musical score. You ask a good open question, and then you reflect, reflect, reflect. One of the reflections might be an affirmation. Then you ask another open question. Reflect, reflect, reflect. And that cycle can repeat, repeat itself quite a few times until you summarize. So you can think of it like a musical score, and if you use abbreviations for each of those OAR and S, and you get a tape recording or a transcript of your own clinical practice, what will your musical score look like? And if it's just question-answer, question-answer, question-answer, the music will be very busy, very rushed. You'll be pressurized to think about the next question, whereas if it's got the quality that I've just described, it will feel much more relaxed for both parties and you'll be approaching the skillfulness required for motivational interviewing. But what is reflection? If it's not a question, what is it? Well, it's a statement that you make to someone that expresses your understanding of what they are saying, feeling, experiencing or could be saying, feeling and experiencing. In another words, it's a curious guess and the, the statement has intonation that goes down at the end. And you'll notice that. And I think I'll comment about reflections a little bit later, perhaps even in the middle of the demo. I might stop a demo and say that was reflection. If you study some of the transcripts I provided you with this presentation, you'll see, particularly the ones that are MI consistent, that there's a proportion of three or four reflections to every question. Reflections are an invitation for the person to continue talking. And they are extremely important in MI. Okay, finally, summary. With experience, you'll find it possible to make your summary really succinct and thoughtful. Now thoughtfulness in MI means that your summary uses their language, not yours, their words. But what is it that you pull together? Will Miller came up with a lovely analogy here which is in motivational interviewing, what you summarize is the positive. If you like the change talk, which we're gonna come onto in a minute, and he uses the analogy of a bunch of flowers and he says, "If you hand someone a… you hand them a bunch of flowers rather than including all the weeds." And so, the way you select what you do for… to present someone with a summary is really artful and it's a skillful part of the conduct of MI. Okay, so I've gone through these, these core dance steps, the question is to what end? And the goal of MI is to quietly clarify ambivalence and elicit what we call "change talk," okay? And here's an example on the slide of both change talk and its opposite, sustain talk. We heard quite a bit of sustained talk from Helen a moment ago. Change talk is of, is things that someone says that are in favor of, of healing and change. "I am worried about my panic attacks." 

00:38:15
[sil.] 

00:38:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK The pace has to be sufficiently slow for you to notice this, okay? But if you like, these are the jewels that MI thrives on, is having the attentiveness and thoughtfulness to notice the change talk, because in its expression of her positive motivation. Sustain talk, "All my friends drink, so I'm okay." That's the other side of, of Helen's ambivalence. And you'll hear both of these in a conversation with somebody who's feeling ambivalent, whether it's about a mental health thing or a, or substance use. 

00:38:55
[sil.] 

00:39:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Now the point I made about attentiveness is well illustrated here because I've got a slide here about it flickering in a busy conversion, okay? And I'm going to read this out and see if you can notice where the change talk is. "And, well, I don't know, because, you know, my husband, he makes me cross. He leaves the house and says, 'You will be okay,' and it's okay, it's easy for him to say that. I don't like being like this, but what can I do? I feel I am about to have a heart attack and I go all dizzy, and then he just walks out the house and leaves me to get on with it and then I've got to face getting the kids to school." Now where's the change talk? It was delivered fast, anxious, upset but there is and you need a degree of mindfulness to use a phrase that's… a word that's quite well-worn at the moment. For a particular purpose in MI, you need to be settled enough to notice the change talk and where is it here, "I don't like being like this." That's what she said. It's quite a powerful, positive motivation. So step one in motivational interviewing, is to create the kind of comfortable conditions for somebody whereby they're talking about change and you can recognize the change talk. Step two is to respond to it in a way that it grows, that the person puts more flowers into the ring, if you like, okay? And you can do this, by in this case, simply asking an open question. Why didn't you like being like this? So you've got a choice about how to respond to something like that, to a shower of talk like that and if you're being MI consistent, you'll be listening out for their strengths and listening out for the change talk. Why don't you let, why don't you, why don't you like being like this? More change talk will follow. And the logic behind MI is that the more this change talk is given freedom to move and to be expressed, the better will be your outcome. Those of you interested in research, there's a body of research on this that more or less confirms that hypothesis, that the more you use this kind of listening skill, illicit the change talk, the better will be the outcome. And that is evoking. That is what evoking means. Another way you can respond to that is to use a reflection, and indeed high levels of MI skillfulness would involve using reflections rather than questions for reasons that you can go and read about and think about. I'm not going to go into them all today, but here's an example. You're not happy with these panic attacks. Did you see the way my voice intonation went down? You are feeling like you'd really like things to be different, is another example of reflection. The answer to that will be more change talk. And if you like, that is just the deepest we are going to go on a deep dive into MI is what we've just gone through now, okay?

00:42:05
STEPHAN ROLLNICK "People are generally better persuaded by the reasons which they have themselves discovered, than by those which have come into the mind of others." I'm rising to the surface a little bit here now and showing you a, a, a quote from Blaise Pascal, who captures the essence of it very, very well, which is that somebody like Helen is probably better persuaded by the reasons that she has herself discovered, that's her change talk, than by those which come into the mind of other people. And so what Miller and I've done is produced three editions of this basic text spanning over 20 years, and the rather ill-formed animal, if you like, is becoming clearer and clearer to us, such that we now have this, this new textbook produced in 2012 which contains a framework that I'm going to be presenting to you in a moment, as well as a couple of other the features that feel different and new to us. One is the introduction of compassion. Another is the inclusion of planning in the conduct of MI. And a third one is our realization that MI doesn't need to just focus on behavior change, it can focus on any change. So that felt like quite a big step, okay? So it's been a 20 to 25 year journey for us, the developments of MI, which is being not theory-driven, but practice drive. And we make no apologies for that because that seems to be where the exciting developments are coming home for us.

Offering Information and Advice 

00:43:50
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Okay, so what I'm gonna do now is take you through a new four process model of MI. I'm glancing at my watch and I see that we've got 45 minutes to go. I'm gonna grab a slip of water now, give you a chance to have a 30-second break and I'm going to describe this new four process model and try and demonstrate elements of it in relation to Helen. It's a hot summer afternoon here in Wales. I'm hoping the weather's treating you well where you are. It's a very rare event for us, it usually rains. Okay. What I'm gonna do now is try and convey to you this framework that Miller and I put together, which we are hoping you will, there will be familiar bells ringing for you and that it captures, umm… helps you cross what this MI dance is like. So we would say the first thing you want to do with somebody is settling to a helpful conversation. Not jump too far ahead too quickly like you saw me do a moment ago. And then, given that most human beings who come and see us have multiple interrelated struggles. They might come in with a label, "alcohol" but there'll be other issues. You want to find some kind of useful direction for the conversation. Then if you want to do MI, you want to draw out their own good reasons for changing. That's the heart of motivational interviewing. And then if they're ready, you want to support them to plan some changes. And what we did was we gave simple words to each of these four processes. You can see I've constructed them in a, like stair steps model which does imply that you move one to the other, but be mindful that they're not stages that, that, that when you're on the third step, the second and the first step are operational and I'll try and find other ways of describing the interrelationships, but here are the four words we came up with. Engage, focus, finding direction. I'm hoping that was no surprise to you, the word "evoke," and then plan. 

00:46:35
[sil.] 

00:46:40
STEPHAN ROLLNICK What we're suggesting is that MI involves each of these four processes. That you can engage and focus with somebody without it being MI, the critical bit of MI is the evoking, that's the critical heart of MI. But it appears to, we feel need these other two processes to have to be very active and to be skillfully managed in order to begin to evoke, okay? What I'm gonna do now is go through each one of them in turn. And then let you see me trying each of them out with Helen.

ENGAGE - 3 tips 

00:47:20
1. Don't do anything else to begin with 

00:47:20
2. Practice listening: the more skilled you are, the more you save time 

00:47:20
3. Encourage colleagues 

00:47:20
The 20% rule 

00:47:20
Helen: Engaging…demo 

00:47:25
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Okay? Engage. This one has received a very bad… this word's received a very bad name in, in, in so many circles. I think it truly shocks me, as I speak now as a patient in healthcare because I've got multiple interrelated, a few multiple interrelated health cases. I'm truly shocked by the absence of engagement and indeed I would like to suggest you that if all practitioners of all kinds were skillful in engagement, it would transform healthcare, mental health and that the reasons why skilful engagement doesn't happen in our field like mental health and substance abuse as well as it should… 

00:48:10
[sil.] 

00:48:15
STEPHAN ROLLNICK It's truly a tragedy in many cases. And I feel that, that people's lives are in our hands and we're in a very privileged position and failure to engage with people, who then get lost to services and to treatment, is really very, very poor practice and harms people. So that's the sort of negative, passionate origin of I'm about to say, which is, what is engagement? And the most common mistake, I bet you can guess what this is, the most common mistake is to imagine that engagement just involves being nice and friendly and warm with people. Then you get on with the business. I've seen that as a patient in healthcare. But I've also seen it in mental health. "Hi, how are you today? How did you get here?" "Yeah, fine. I think…" "Okay, so now let's start talking about the problems." And engagement is much more than that. And our, our debt to somebody like Carl Rogers is immense here. I suppose a simple way of describing it is you want to settle into a helpful conversation, and it involves at its heart allowing someone to tell their story and use those core skills to give them the space to not just to tell you their story, but to have the experience inside them that this person is understanding my story, is listening to me and that the conversation that we're having is helpful, okay? And if you've got scale from not to ten in terms of skillfulness and engagement, where are your skills? Where are those of your colleagues around you? Where are the scales to measure skillfulness engagement? There's not many around, so I'm hoping that this will lead to some really good developments in, in clinical research and practice. Okay. Now here's a few tips about engagement before I try and demonstrate it. I suggest that it might be helpful to do nothing but engage to begin with, nothing but engage. That means I've got to be extremely restrained when faced with Helen, not to raise a whole lot of problems or things that are on my mind, but to just engage. And this requires enormous restraint on my part, and it's not easy. You'll notice when I do it, have a think about the, the musical score of my skills. How many reflections am I using to each question? Do I produce a summary that really captures what Helen's saying? After the summary, does she say something like, "Yes, that's right, you've got me"? Because in a way, engagement… you know you are a 9 out of 10 for engagement if somebody says, "Yes, you really understand me." And so the practice of the reflective listening skills and engagement will never do anyone harm and that's why I said at the beginning I'm hoping you will head out there and practice for all you're worth because reflection is, is easy to get on top of and refine if you just commit yourself to practice, practice, practice. I'd also like you to encourage colleagues and I can tell you from experience that the more skilled you are, the more time you save, and this is rather perverse. In other words, listening can save you time. The better you are at it, the quicker everything goes, okay? So that's what, that's what I'm going to illustrate now. And so we're gonna ask Helen to come in, in a moment. Let's just clarify what's happened here, okay? Let's remind ourselves. Helen was seen at the school gates. I am a school counselor. I'm about to go to a meeting, it's the beginning of the day. And this teacher comes in and says, "Look, I've got somebody who I think is smelling of alcohol at the school gates. She's very upset. She's a little bit angry and, umm… can you see her?" And I think, "Oh, no. Look. I've only got 20 minutes for this because then I've got to go. I'm going to delay the meeting for, for 20 minutes, but then I've got to go in." So I'm a little bit uptight here but, umm… I will see her, but I will say to myself, which you saw in the previous slide, the 20 percent rule. I'm going to say to myself, "If I've got 20, 25 minutes, I'm going to spend the first 20 percent only engaging. And that 20 percent rule, I, I challenge you to find a circumstance where it doesn't bear fruit, okay?" Only engage for the first 20 percent. So Helen's going to come in, in a moment and before she does, what would you say is a good, useful goal here with somebody like Helen? Is it to help her with her panic attacks? Is it to help her to stop drinking? What would you say? I wonder about this, how's about this, I don't want to do Helen any harm. And I'd like Helen to come back again, that that's my goal. Whatever progress she makes in the 20 minutes, we'll see, but my number one priority is to make sure that Helen comes back again to see me because that's in her interest and those of the kids. Okay, so, Janine, if you could come back in again and get into the role of Helen, I'll grab some water. 

00:53:45
[sil.] 

00:53:50
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And I'll go for four or five minutes now and then we'll have a debrief. And all I know is that your name is, is Helen Miller and you were seen outside the school gates by one of the teachers. 

00:54:05
HELEN Yes. 

00:54:05
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Umm… my name is Steve. And I'm the counselor here in the school, and… 

00:54:10
HELEN I don't need a counselor. 

00:54:15
STEPHAN ROLLNICK You don't feel you, you need someone to speak to? 

00:54:15
HELEN I don't need to speak to anyone one. I just want to go home. I just need to go home now. I don't feel very well. 

00:54:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Okay. 

00:54:25
HELEN You pointed that out, I didn't feel very well, but I want to go home now. 

00:54:25
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Okay. Umm… 

00:54:30
HELEN I don't… Why am I here? I don't know why I am here. I just, just want to go home. 

00:54:35
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And I want you to feel free to do that if that's what you'd really like to do. 

00:54:35
HELEN I don't see the point of being here. 

00:54:35
STEPHAN ROLLNICK It's really up to you. I have the 15 or 20 minutes this morning. If you'd like to talk to me, I'd be more than happy to talk to you. 

00:54:50
HELEN I don't know what, what you want me to talk to me about. I just, I just… I felt like I wasn't very well. I wasn't well at the gates. 

00:54:55
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right. 

00:54:55
HELEN You know, when I dropped my children off to school, I wasn't very well. 

00:54:55
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right. 

00:55:00
HELEN And I just… when I am not very well, I just need to go home. I can't stay here. 

00:55:05
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right, so you… 

00:55:05
HELEN I can't be here. I want to go home. 

00:55:05
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right. And so you would… you managed to get the children to school this morning. I understand you've got two little boys. 

00:55:10
HELEN Yes, I have. Yes. 

00:55:15
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And you managed to get the, get the children to school but you got to the school gates and you really didn't feel well. 

00:55:20
HELEN I didn't feel well, no. 

00:55:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK In what way? 

00:55:20
HELEN I just felt like I… I just felt like I was having a… like a heart attack. 

00:55:30
STEPHAN ROLLNICK I see, I see. So, so you managed to get them to school, but then things almost felt like they were, like almost exploding inside you. 

00:55:40
HELEN Just… yeah. Exploding, yes. 

00:55:40
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Your heart was racing. 

00:55:45
HELEN My… my heart was racing. I just felt like dizzy and I just… When I feel like that, I just need to be home. I can't bear being out. I don't want to be out when I'm like that. That's why I don't want to be here. 

00:56:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right. Because when… just to get home means that it's somewhere you'd at least feel safe and you don't feel safe out and about right now in this morning. 

00:56:05
HELEN And I don't know why I'm in here. I just, I just can't. I just feel like… I just want to be home, yeah. 

00:56:10
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Okay. And are you happy to talk to me for just a few more moments and then go home? Will that be okay? 

00:56:20
HELEN I just need to go home soon. 

00:56:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Okay, okay, okay. Tell me what's been happening? 

00:56:25
HELEN I just felt really, I just felt really panicky when I, when I… I don't know. I just had this sort of heart, I just felt like I was having a, like a heart attack and, and I just got… I get like that sometimes but it's okay. It's okay. I just… I deal with it by myself at home. 

00:56:45
STEPHAN ROLLNICK So things built up inside you, it sounds like things built up inside you on the way to school. Yeah? You managed to get them to school, but things were building up inside you. 

00:56:55
HELEN They're just… yes. Yeah, yeah. 

00:57:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And you've got these two little boys… 

00:57:00
HELEN Yeah. 

00:57:05
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And quite an effort to get them to school. 

00:57:10
HELEN Yeah, yeah. They're lively, they're, you know, just (inaudible ). You know, you got to get them to school on time and I needed to get them in school on time and I just, I don't know. I just felt like everything… I just really… I don't know. I feel I was gonna have a heart attack, but anyway it… 

00:57:25
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah, but you were in charge of these little ones and they're quite, quite, quite handful, it sounds like… Yeah, they are charging around all over the place and you leave the, you leave the front door and you close it and you think, "I just want to get these boys into school safely." 

00:57:40
HELEN But that was, yeah, but that was what boys like. You know, boys are like that. 

00:57:45
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah, yeah. 

00:57:45
HELEN I know that. They are boys and they, they are brothers and they're close in age and they fight and… 

00:57:50
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And they carry on and actually getting everything done that you need to do, to get them up and dressed and out takes quite a lot of effort for you. Yeah? 

00:58:05
HELEN Umm… no. It shouldn't do. No, it shouldn't do. It doesn't make… just… 

00:58:15
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Because you're somebody who usually copes with things pretty well. 

00:58:15
HELEN Yes, yes. Definitely. 

00:58:15
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah. 

00:58:20
HELEN Yes, I cope. I cope really well, I always have. 

00:58:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK So the person I'm meeting now isn't somebody who, you're not always like that. You, you are somebody with strength and you can cope with situation. 

00:58:30
HELEN I'm very capable. 

00:58:35
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah. And so it must feel a little bit humiliating for you to sit here in this kind of state. 

00:58:40
HELEN That's why I don't want to be here and that's why I didn't want… 

00:58:40
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah. 

00:58:40
HELEN The teacher to bring me in here because I, if I feel like that, I need to be on my own. I… 

00:58:50
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so here you are in front of a complete stranger. I mean, my name is Steve, okay? But you haven't met me before and you don't… 

00:58:55
HELEN No, no. 

00:58:55
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Here you are in front of a complete stranger and it must feel quite humiliating for you. 

00:59:00
HELEN It feels very humiliating. And please, I really… yes, yeah. 

00:59:05
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah, yeah. And so it will be helpful to you if, if quite soon we end the conversation and you are given some space to go home. 

00:59:10
HELEN Yes. 

00:59:10
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And yet it sounds like you, you are starting to calm down. It looks like you're starting to calm down just a little bit now. 

00:59:20
HELEN Yeah, yes. Yeah. 

00:59:25
STEPHAN ROLLNICK You're calming down just a little bit, okay. 

00:59:25
HELEN Yeah, I guess so. I… Yeah, I just still I need I think to… I just… It's difficult for me because I, no I can usually deal, I can deal with this myself. 

00:59:40
[sil.] 

00:59:45
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah, yeah. And, and it's… It's not something that you're proud of that you end up in a situation like this. 

00:59:50
[sil.] 

00:59:55
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah, yeah. It's not being easy for you. And these two boys, it sounds like you love them, but it's hard work, eh? Yeah? 

01:00:10
HELEN Sorry. I, I shouldn't be… we shouldn't be having this conversation. 

01:00:15
STEPHAN ROLLNICK It's okay. That's all right. Nah, that's all right, that's all right. Perhaps I can just try and summarize what you've said to me so far. Please let me know if there's something that I've got wrong or I don't understand. Can I have a try? Can I have a go at trying just to capture what you've said? All right? 

01:00:35
HELEN Yeah. 

01:00:35
STEPHAN ROLLNICK You, umm… you go the boys up this morning and they are boys. 

01:00:40
HELEN Yeah. 

01:00:40
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah, they are boys. And, umm… you are a competent person who usually gets things done. 

01:00:55
HELEN Yeah. Yes, I am. 

01:00:55
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And you got them out the front door this morning, but… 

01:01:00
HELEN It should be easy, shouldn't it? But, you know, it's easy, it's easily done. 

01:01:05
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah, yeah. And yet for you this morning, things didn't go so well and you ended up at the school gate, umm… feeling really frightened and came in here now feeling humiliated to see, to see a stranger like me wanting to just go back home. 

01:01:25
HELEN I did not want to be… I don't want to home… yeah. 

01:01:25
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Have I got you? 

01:01:25
HELEN Yeah, yeah. Definitely, yeah. 

01:01:30
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Okay, okay. Anything else you want to add? 

01:01:35
HELEN No. No, it's… 

01:01:40
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Okay, so let's just stop there. I cast my eye on the watch because I wanted the demo to be no more than five minutes, umm… I think it probably was that. I'm gonna give Janine a chance to come out of role now. 

01:01:50
JANINE Okay. 

01:01:55
[sil.] 

01:02:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Okay. Umm… well, I'll reflect a little bit about my, my musical score in a moment but, umm… how was that for you? 

01:02:10
JANINE Umm… it was, it was obviously very, very difficult because… for me to be here and I didn't want to be here. And I resented, I resented being here umm… and I found it, I am in control, that's my perception of me. I'm in control. I don't need to talk to anybody about this, but I found myself being able to, to talk to you and, and… 

01:02:50
STEPHAN ROLLNICK I thought you were going to walk out. I was pretty worried you were going to walk out. 

01:02:55
JANINE I, I wanted to… When I first came in, I just wanted to tell you I was going. I didn't need to here, and go. 

01:03:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right. 

01:03:05
JANINE But… I guess I just felt that, umm… you weren't judging me in any way, so I felt that it, it sort of gave me a bit of perspective on the morning and just by going over the events that led up to me coming to school and, and… Yes, I was upset, but I didn't feel totally bad about myself. I felt positive about myself as well in a funny way and it's funny to say that, but I felt, well, yes, I am in control, so perhaps this is a blip. And I can be… 

01:03:45
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah. I noticed, I noticed when I said something positive to you in the form of an affirmation, she reacted immediately. Did you notice that? Absolutely immediately and positively. That was a gorgeous illustration of the power of affirmation, not of my skill, because it's just a gift that you give somebody. Affirmation is something that you notice quite easily, they are strengths but her response was, was remarkable. Absolutely, that's me. And it can turn something that's very difficult into something that feels, starts to feel a bit healing. Okay, I think I'm going to move on. We're gonna have Helen back in just a few moments, okay? 

01:04:20
JANINE Okay. 

01:04:25
"Find a useful direction" 

01:04:25
FOCUS - 1 tip 

01:04:25
1. Establish direction together 

01:04:25
Any skilled guide or coach would do that! 

01:04:25
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And we're going to take off from exactly where we've left off, okay? Just a quick comment about, umm… my musical score. I think if you look at that, you'll probably find I was using a lot of reflection there, different kinds, not purposeful reflection, trying to consider change within, nothing. Just engage. Only engage and you'll find the musical score was… I can't, I haven't got a sense of it now, but it was mostly reflective listening, and then the summary then wasn't bad. I'd give myself about 4 or 5 out of 10. Some of you might give me a higher school. Difficult for me, I've just been, been swimming in the water and I can't quite get a sense of the distance from it. Okay, let's move on to focusing. It's about finding a useful direction and there are many in this example, many. And it's very common. I'll just make a few comments about this. The idea is to establish this direction together, and this is something that any skilled guide or Coach would do and the phrase we use in, in our most recent text is, "Agenda Mapping." And there's not a large body of literature on the subject of how you establish focus with someone. We call it a agenda mapping in that what you want to do. If you imagine like the two of you sitting in a boat and you're trying to work out where you're gonna take this boat and you're about to launch, well, you've got a piece of paper or a map in front of you and you work out what will be the most helpful direction to go. And that's what I'll demonstrate in a moment. It involves a series of steps which I'll briefly highlight. Hopefully, you'll see me go through them. I bet you I'll miss out a few, but this is the ideal and efforts are underway to measure this as, as a, as a set of competencies. Engagement to begin with, essential, I'd say a fragile 5 out of 10 for engagement with Helen, but it's sufficient to just allow me to move into, into focusing. Essential first step. Lay out the possible topics that I would like to talk about. See if there's any that she'd like to talk about. Decide on the way you're gonna start, ideally, where she's happy. Ideally, agree an order for the different topics and feel free to come back to this agenda mapping process as the consultation or session unfolds. So if you like, umm… this kind of agenda mapping is stepping back from the conversation with the client to consider where you're gonna go and I think I'll just dive in. I think I'll just dive in. You happy to go? 

01:07:35
JANINE Yep. 

01:07:35
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yep. So I'm going to leave off from that last summary and, and take three or four minutes, but perhaps beforehand, umm… Janine, if you can close your ears to this, umm… can I just, Did you notice that alcohol hasn't been mentioned? And, so here I have to raise a very difficult subject. I can smell the alcohol on her, okay? And I have to raise a very difficult subject, umm… while still helping her feel accepted, affirmed and comfortable, this isn't easy. Umm… to do it in a confrontational way is not going to be helpful and that's what I'm going to try and avoid. 

01:08:20
[sil.] 

01:08:25
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Okay. Helen, we've got another 10, 15 minutes or so left. 

01:08:25
HELEN Right. 

01:08:30
STEPHAN ROLLNICK If you feel, you can last the course. Do feel free to leave at any point if you want to. 

01:08:35
HELEN All right. Okay, okay. 

01:08:40
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah? To be honest with you, my, my, my main goal is to encourage you to come back and see me, if that's something you choose you'd like to do, okay? But we could talk about a number of things. 

01:08:50
HELEN Right. 

01:08:55
STEPHAN ROLLNICK okay? And I'm wondering what's going to be most useful. We could talk about those boys and the challenges you have with them. You haven't mentioned your husband, but I know that he is at home with you… 

01:09:05
HELEN Yes. 

01:09:05
STEPHAN ROLLNICK We could talk about him. We could talk about those feelings of panic that you have. 

01:09:10
HELEN Yeah. 

01:09:15
[sil.] 

01:09:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah? Or we could talk about… You know, I must be honest with you, Helen, I can smell a little bit of alcohol in your breathe. And, that's something… 

01:09:30
HELEN That's it, isn't it, then? That's… 

01:09:35
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah. That's something we could talk about, okay? 

01:09:40
HELEN Is that what the teacher… must have done as well then? 

01:09:45
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Teacher did mention it to me, I must be honest. Yeah. But this is really up to you, Helen. There might be something else. What would you most like to talk about? 

01:09:55
HELEN I don't… I… 

01:10:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Is there something else you'd like to talk about? 

01:10:05
HELEN I just…No, I'm not sure because there's so many things going, going on. I don't know what's… 

01:10:10
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah. 

01:10:15
HELEN I, I, I… 

01:10:15
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah. You don't want… too much like… 

01:10:20
HELEN I can't believe… Yeah. 

01:10:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK You can't believe? 

01:10:20
HELEN I can smell… the smell alcohol on my bra. 

01:10:25
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right, right. All right, that's a bit of a shock to you that, that we noticed it. 

01:10:30
HELEN Yes. 

01:10:35
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah, yeah. It's not something you wanted others to necessarily know about. 

01:10:40
HELEN My husband doesn't know. 

01:10:45
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right. He, he doesn't know that you had a drink this morning. 

01:10:50
HELEN No. 

01:10:55
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah, yeah. It's something you've kept from him. 

01:11:00
HELEN Yes, yeah. I had to. I mean, I had to. I had to keep it from him. 

01:11:10
[sil.] 

01:11:15
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Is, is it okay if we talk about the alcohol for a short while? 

01:11:20
HELEN You brought this… Yeah, yeah, go on. 

01:11:25
STEPHAN ROLLNICK It's a bit like the cat's out of the bag. 

01:11:25
HELEN Yeah. 

01:11:30
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Okay, okay. And perhaps we will also touch on the, the panic attacks and possibly your husband, if you feel it's helpful. 

01:11:35
HELEN Okay. 

01:11:35
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And as I say, my main goal is to encourage you to come back and see me if that's what you want. 

01:11:40
HELEN Okay. 

01:11:45
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Okay. All right. I'll stop there, okay? And how was that for you? 

01:11:55
JANINE Umm… again, I found it difficult but I think, umm… I don't know. You ask me what I'd like to talk about and there's just so many things that I got going on and… 

01:12:10
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Your head's hurting in a way. 

01:12:15
JANINE My head's hurting, definitely. 

01:12:15
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah. 

01:12:20
JANINE And, and it's like, I suppose I felt quite resigned 'cause you mentioned the alcohol and I felt quite resigned to the, well, you know, I've got so many things going on. Perhaps I should, like pick one, talk about it. 

01:12:35
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Hmm… How comfortable did you feel with me as a person? 

01:12:40
JANINE Oh, to talk about it? 

01:12:40
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Mm-hmm. 

01:12:45
JANINE I think with what… because you listened before, I felt that I had, we started, you know, I felt, 'cause I said I haven't even spoken to my husband about it. 

01:12:55
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah, I know. And yet to felt… 

01:12:55
JANINE I felt, I could… 

01:13:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Safe to some extent, yeah. 

01:13:00
JANINE To some extent. I mean, it's a difficult one but, but we were just started… 

01:13:05
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Getting there. 

01:13:05
JANINE Getting there. 

01:13:10
STEPHAN ROLLNICK We'll continue in a moment. 

01:13:10
JANINE Okay. 

01:13:10
"Draw out their own good reasons to change" 

01:13:10
EVOKE - 3 tips 

01:13:10
1. Ask questions that evoke change talk 

01:13:10
2. Use reflection & summarize change talk 

01:13:10
3. Ask questions like, "what do you want to do?" 

01:13:10
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Thank you very much. Okay. That was tough. Umm… I illustrated most of the elements of agenda mapping there. But I think you can see that, that there's a really critical junction early on in an interview like this where decisions have to be made about what to talk about. Otherwise you just go around in circles, touching on this problem and that problem, and I'm not sure that's helpful to people. And certainly with motivational interviewing, it's very purposeful because what you want to try and get to is the point where you can evoke and that's the next, umm… the next topic we're getting on to, okay? So I'm gonna go through evoking and planning with you and then we'll ask Helen to come back. I'll demonstrate then and reach any conclusions and we'll be ending the seminar in 10, 15 minutes, okay? This is where we started with motivation interviewing, with evoking, okay? And one way of putting it is to draw out people's own good reasons to change. What William Miller noticed when he developed motivational interviewing, I noticed the same thing. We were leading separate lives and we hadn't met, but we were both working in the addiction treatment field and what we noticed was that, umm… the subject of people being in denial and lacking in motivation and resisting efforts to treat them was a widespread part of the culture in which we were working, me in South Africa, Will in the United States. 

01:15:00
[sil.] 

01:15:00
"If they want to, support them to plan changes" 

01:15:00
PLAN - 3 tips 

01:15:00
1. Hold back from solving the problem 

01:15:00
2. Work together on a concrete plan 

01:15:00
3. Suggestions not instructions! 

01:15:00
HELEN Evoking and planning…demo 

01:15:05
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And that, the, the efforts to persuade people to change and convince them that they had a bigger problem than they really thought and were saying they thought they had, had a counterproductive feel about it in the same… The more you, and I demonstrated this earlier, the more you try and persuade, the more the person resists and denies, the more you pass a judgment, they lack motivation and so on in this kind of negative spiral. In my case, it took a dramatic form. I was working as a nurse aid in a treatment unit and I was responsible for a group of young alcoholics, evening group. And one of the most notoriously resistant patients whom, in the coffee room they used to talk about him as somebody who was a classic denier, classic alcoholic. He lied about his drinking, he lacked motivation. He never said a word in the group, uh, walked out and shot his wife and then himself in front of two five-year-old twin daughters. Now I say… I tell you this traumatic story because I feel I've spent the rest of my life coming to terms with that experience and how people can be spoken to in such a way that their motivation to change is enhanced and they feel uplifted rather than take the opposite route, which is what this young man did. What William Miller noticed was that if he shifted his style from a confrontational one to one that was gentler, which is what you've seen me trying to demonstrate, and try to draw out from people their own good reasons to change rather than tell them, their resistance and… resistance and denial went down and this was a fundamental insight for him. So that the… if you shift your style and you speak to them in a certain way, your, your outcomes in the conversation are much better. This was the starting point for motivational interviewing. 19, early 1980s, working with a group of young psychologists in Bergen Norway, he started to formulate that first animal that I showed you in the form of a kind of a rough elephant on one of my slides, but this truth was there right at the beginning, which is that if… the harder and tougher the problem, if you take a soft and gentle and accepting approach, people soften and they can face these really difficult things inside them. In this case, it was addiction. Now, in terms of the technical dance steps, what you want to be doing is asking questions that evoke change talk rather than sustain talk. But that's not a simple technical matter, because you can't ignore the sustain talk because it's part of people's inner experience. It's there and you will hear this Helen, but motivational interviewing is a purposeful activity in which you use these core skills to direct the conversation uh, into the stream of eliciting change talk. And when you do that, you use reflection to capture and summarize this change talk for the person. And you try and do that in the form of that musical score that I described, as many cycles as you can on the simple assumption that if there's a sense in which you're opening flood gates and the person's natural internal motivation to change is tumbling out, and the less you put in the way of this natural process, the better will be your outcome. And then, if somebody's been through that process, you can often ask a very simple question like, "What do you want to do?" And that takes you into the realm of planning, which is what I'll, I'll turn to now. Okay. Some people might not get there. We have no idea with Helen, I somehow doubt it, given that I've only got 10 minutes. But with Helen, my goal is to, is to have her back the next week. And what she does about her drinking is something that will unfold. The safety of her and the kids are number one here. Now, I'm planning, until… we conceptualized it like this. The whole world of planning and skilled training was viewed as something out with the orbit of MI. In other words, MI was when you had someone with motivational problems. You got them to the point where they were ready for action and then you didn't need to worry about MI anymore. Those of you who are familiar with the stages of change model will recognize that in some of the oversimplified thinking about that model which has it that it's in the earliest stages of change at their motivational problems. Later when they get into action, you don't have them. Now, I don't believe that's what the, uh… the authors of this stage of change model really meant. And I certainly don't believe that that clinical practice matches that oversimplified account. Put bluntly, if people are ready to change, it doesn't mean there ambivalence disappears. The hesitant voices inside them remain. And secondly, if you speak to them in a different style, in a confrontational style informed by the directing style, just because they're ready to change, you're going to hit trouble. You're going to hit trouble. And you are gonna hit precisely the kind of conversational troubles that you would have experienced when they were in earliest stages of change. And it was this realization that led Miller and I have to suggest that, that the use of motivational interview, you can embrace a seamless process of working across all of these stages of change including planning. And this is an area that's yet to be properly divide up to, and I believe we are just touching the surface of what could be something very profitable. Three tips for planning, hold back from solving the problem for the person. Try and work together to form a concrete plan and, umm… listen out for change talk because as I said a moment ago, it's going to appear, change talk and sustain talk are gonna appear and all your motivational interviewing skills can be used here in this process. Finally, think about the difference between a suggestion and in and an instruction. Instead of giving someone a piece of advice, how's it about thinking about the word, "suggestion." I love the word because it implies that it's just something that you might take up and it enhances someone's autonomy and is very compatible with motivational interviewing. Now whether I get that far in this interview is something that we'll have to see, umm… probably not. But in any case I view, the evoking and the planning is a seamless process and indeed when you are planning with somebody, you are evoking at the same time. You have a sense of direction, so your focus is there and if something goes wrong, you must always return to engagement. And with that statement that I've just made, I've just captured the dynamic interchange between these four processes in this new framework. I think I'm ready to see Helen again. So Janine's coming back and we'll have a last, brief exchange. We'll, we'll have a little bit of reflection afterwards and then we'll find up this, wind up the seminar. 

01:22:35
[sil.] 

01:22:40
STEPHAN ROLLNICK So, you, you're happy to spend just a couple of minutes talking about your use of alcohol, eh? Yeah. 

01:22:45
HELEN Yeah. 

01:22:45
STEPHAN ROLLNICK How is it for you? 

01:22:50
HELEN It, it help, it helps with these, like panicky things I have, that have been happening. 

01:23:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK I see. So you've, you've been having these feelings of panic. 

01:23:05
HELEN Yep. 

01:23:10
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And, umm… you find that the, the alcohol settles it in some way. 

01:23:15
HELEN It helps, it numbs. Yeah, it makes me feel… Yeah, yeah. It just… 

01:23:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK It sort of numbs and quietens things down. 

01:23:20
HELEN Yeah. 

01:23:25
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Maybe stops your mind racing. 

01:23:25
HELEN Yeah. Yeah, definitely stops my mind from racing, yeah. 

01:23:30
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And where would you mind race to if you didn't have the alcohol? 

01:23:35
HELEN Oh. Just, just thinking, oh, am I doing it right with the children. I can't… I'm just worried about them and, you know, they're so, I mean, they're adorable but they're just so hard work, you know, and we, we adopted them and I… Oh, there's just so much. I gave up work, I… you know, I had a career break and that's what I wanted to do and I just, I guess I thought it would all be like brilliant and fairytale and… My mother… 

01:24:15
STEPHAN ROLLNICK So you really wanted to have children and these two adopted children, that, that led you to sort of stop work, take a break. 

01:24:20
HELEN Yes, yes. 

01:24:25
STEPHAN ROLLNICK This was going to be the time to do what you… sounds like you always wanted to. 

01:24:25
HELEN And I do, I do. Definitely. I definitely… 

01:24:30
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And you do enjoy it. 

01:24:30
HELEN I do. 

01:24:35
STEPHAN ROLLNICK But there's a but. 

01:24:35
HELEN But it's tougher… 

01:24:40
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Maybe tougher than you thought. 

01:24:40
HELEN It's tougher than I thought. 

01:24:40
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah? It's tougher, it's tougher than you thought and when you, when you are sitting there at home and you're about to go out, umm… your mind is racing. 

01:24:50
HELEN Just want them to be safe. I want them to… My eldest nearly got run over yesterday, I mean, on the way to school 'cause he's so… I mean, he is… 

01:25:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK My word. 

01:25:05
HELEN It doesn't… He's always good for danger. I mean, he's seven years old but he's just, he's just. You know, he's hyperactive. 

01:25:10
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right. 

01:25:15
HELEN Umm… he doesn't see the danger sometimes when he… 

01:25:15
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right. And so you have this terrible shock. It sounds like it was quite a shock. 

01:25:20
HELEN It, it was an awful shock, yes, Yeah. 

01:25:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Which must have made this morning thinking about going off to school, it must have made the thought of going off to school quite difficult. 

01:25:30
HELEN I couldn't… Exactly, I just thought… I could sleep well last night either I just thought, oh, my God. 

01:25:35
STEPHAN ROLLNICK How am I going to cope tomorrow. 

01:25:35
HELEN How am I… What if this… what if he'd… Sorry. What if it'd been run over and actually run… and I'm responsible for him and I just… 

01:25:50
STEPHAN ROLLNICK So there you had your terrible middle-of-the-night fears about it and then you set off this morning and, and the alcohol settled you. 

01:26:00
HELEN Yeah, I know. Yeah. Well, I thought it would, but it didn't as it happened, you know. 

01:26:05
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah. 

01:26:10
HELEN It got me out of the house but I, I got as far as the school and I just so, it was like such a sense of relief that I got them there in one piece… 

01:26:15
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah, yeah. 

01:26:15
HELEN And they'd gotten in to school. I just Then that made me stop like… 

01:26:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah, almost like collapsing in a nervous heap, yeah? 

01:26:25
HELEN Yeah. 

01:26:25
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And you got out to the school, and you were like a nervous wreck. 

01:26:30
HELEN Yeah. 

01:26:30
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Yeah. And so the alcohol helped you to begin with and stopped your mind racing a bit, but then you were left at the school gates then the humiliation of coming in here and, and actually talking about alcohol. Yeah? Which is something your husband doesn't even know about. 

01:26:50
HELEN I mean, we have… obviously, we drink, you know, like I said, we have, we've always had, you know, it's always been us for years. You know, just the two of us. And we've always had social times and… 

01:27:00
HELEN Yeah, okay. 

01:27:00
STEPHAN ROLLNICK He doesn't know I had the drinks. 

01:27:05
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Okay. He, he doesn't know that. 

01:27:05
HELEN No. 

01:27:05
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And, and, can I just say that this has all been sustain talk. And it's perfectly reasonable and a natural part of her experience. I've got my eye on the time. We've got just two, three minutes and so I'm switching it now. You'll, you'll see the evocation of change talk. I'll let that run for a little bit and then I'll stop again. And, Helen, what, what concerns have you got about your drinking? 

01:27:30
HELEN I shouldn't be doing it in the day, I guess. I shouldn't be doing it. But it helps and that's the thing. It's been helping me. 

01:27:40
STEPHAN ROLLNICK And during the day, it's not the sort of thing you want to be doing. 

01:27:45
HELEN Not ideally, no. But it helps. 

01:27:45
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Right. It helps to settle you and yet there's something about drinking during the day that you are not happy with. 

01:27:55
HELEN I'm, I'm a mum of two adopted children. I, I have to be… I have to be so careful, extra careful even than, more the natural parents maybe, natural mums, because… 

01:28:10
STEPHAN ROLLNICK It's a big task you have taken on and it sounds like you took this on very positively and you are a competent person. 

01:28:20
HELEN Yeah. 

01:28:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK But to be, but to be dependant on taking alcohol to settle your nerves is just, it doesn't feel right for you. 

01:28:30
HELEN It doesn't feel right, but… 

01:28:35
Engaging 

01:28:35
Focusing 

01:28:35
Evoking 

01:28:35
Planning 

01:28:35
Conclusion 

01:28:35
1. Shift in attitude and style is effective 

01:28:35
2. MI involves a calm connecting and drawing out solutions from the patient 

01:28:35
and the subtitle? 

01:28:35
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Okay. I'll stop there, okay? I'm just gonna stop there, okay? I'm just gonna stop there because I'm conscious of the time and we're going to wind up. So there's no debrief. So I just want to say, did you notice that just a simple question, what concerns have you got about alcohol, uh, most of what then followed was change talk built on a platform of having listen to her, what alcohol does to for her that's good. Okay, so those are four processes. We never got to planning, which is what I suspected and I'll just conclude with a couple of comments here. That a shift in attitude will start, from where I started at the beginning of the seminar to what you've just seen here can be effective for settling someone down and getting them into a comfortable space where they say why and how they might change, which is where we were heading. And MI involves a sort of a calm connecting, which is what I tried to do with Helen, and drawing out from her, her own solutions, which is, where we were going very, very soon. The subtitle. Why didn't I like the subtitle? Well, I'll show you now in the next slide and then I… it's just a joke, just before we say goodbye. Treating substance abuse and mental health disorders is the most pathological type of series of labels, and I would like to be a patient who's feeling like I'm being treat I'm being seen by people who view me that way. What about this? I've got an alternative down there to that subtitle. MI in helping people who run into difficulty with alcohol and anxious feelings, that's the human being I'm faced with here and it's in that spirit that MI is used for and I hope it might be of some use to her. Okay, well, it's coming up to the half hour. And we're getting off the boat now. And I don't think we've had too many rocky rides. We've been okay, eh? 

01:30:20
JANINE Yeah, absolutely. 

01:30:20
STEPHAN ROLLNICK Umm… and I hope it's been fairly calm for you. No one's got, got seasick and I hope you haven't been bored or asleep. And I wish you well from a wonderfully, rarely sunny, well, Wales afternoon. I wish you good morning and be well. Thank you.
