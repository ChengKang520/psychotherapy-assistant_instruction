KATHRYN ROSSI Good evening. We're so happy that you're here. I'm Kathryn Rossi and I could not be more excited to introduce Diane Ackerman. I don't think that she needs no introduction for everyone in this and so I'm gonna attempt in 24 seconds. She, I believe, is an extraordinary visionary thinker, I, I consider her wild at heart and her newest book One Hundred Names for Love is completely inspiring to me and it brings back some very wonderful memories of when my husband had his stroke and also some difficult ones too. And so she's done some work for us that I think that we have, ah, a great deal of gratitude for her. When I asked Diane, "Well, what's, what's your growing at? I wanna say something to the audience about you and something right now," and what she told me was a story of her husband that after all these years of his, his very serious stroke, a year ago he got up at one o'clock in the morning and he'd decided to do artwork and he did painting and multimedia work and he, he did it for six hours that first night. And he's done it every night since and he had his first gallery showing this year and I think that's remarkable. And without further ado, please welcome me with a heartfelt gratitude, Diane Ackerman.

DIANE ACKERMAN Thank you so much. What a joy it is to be at this conference and especially to hear that relationships first is, ah, introducing itself to you, I'm part of the organization, I'm really honored to be part of it. Uhm, and tonight I get to share with you, ah, a very personal story about how deeply healing a loving relationship can be. My husband and I fell in love at Penn State in the early 1970s when I was a flower child undergraduate. I'm sure you can't imagine that. And he was a professor with yards of education and wavy brown hair and a really classy English accent. We talked gamely about life and literature in his office hours and he wi-- responded very well to my writing and for several semesters afterwards we just kept bumping into each other on campus. And then on our first real date, ah, we had drinks at his house, we stayed up talking nonstop until dawn and I stayed for 40 years. It's pretty much that-- yeah. Paul and I came from wildly different cultures, generations, and ethnic backgrounds. American culture was the backdrop that I grew up with but because Paul discovered it as an adult, he never quite took his oddities, it's oddities for granted. For example, he tried to, to cook Thanks Giving dinner and his job was to make on the corn on the cob and after about half an hour he came to me very frustrated, he said he couldn't get the corn soft in the middle. He kept boiling it but he just, he, he just couldn't. Eighteen years older than I, uhm, he grow up in an English coal mining village during World War II, he listen to swing music and he had memories of being bombed. I was a baby boomer, steeped and Beatles, hear a rock and roll and my dad owned one of the first McDonald's. Yeah. I hear some voices and let me tell you wrapping hamburgers every summer will hurt you into poetry. Well. Paul and I seemed also to be on completely different, ah, time schedules and different time zones. He patrol the darker recesses of the night writing in a semitrance or watching old movies. Uhm, one of his favorites was I Sailed to Tahiti with an All Girl Crew which you may remember and he will just, ah, be up all night and retreat to slumber at last at five or six in the morning. Song birds migrate at night and then in my imagination I just twined his restlessness with their lunar flights. Now, I, on the other hand, was completely bewitched by daylight. I woke at dawn, I greeted him with a gentle tag-you're-at-hand slap before he climbed into bed. And he always waited for me, ah, to wake before he went to sleep so that he could kiss me good mo-- good morning and good night at the same time. He called our relay the changing of the guard and he did a fair, if nakedly dangling, imitation of the queen's stiff-legged soldiers outside of Buckingham Palace each morning. He was without exception the most deliciously corky human being I had ever met. He was a classic British eccentric right out of myth or legend or a P.G. Wodehouse novel. He wrote on a clanky old Smith Corona typewriter in a cork line study and had-- the study had no windows. He said he didn't need nature. He could invent nature in his novels. Now, in contrast my study has all windows. He wouldn't touch or being near fresh fruit, beets, cucumbers, or tomatoes. He would physically recoil in horror. He rarely left the house. He hated wind, rain, snow, well, actually, any weather at, at all. He didn't like wearing clothes and so he would cheerfully stroll around the house or the yard naked and because society does require clothes sometimes he did make concessions. In the summer, he wore swim shorts and a blue short sleeve shirt whenever we went out and this was to formal or informal occasions and in the winter he wore a velour jogging suit but never ever socks. At least once he flew home England logging a rim of typing paper which he sat on to soften it up, he said. I found this eccentricities really novel and amusing in part because I knew that they weren't an affectation but somehow had grown naturally like crystals in the cave of his personality. They sprang unconsciously from a childhood in an English coal mining town and a deeply, deeply eccentric family in which it was quite typical for him to pay a call on his relatives only to find aunts, uncles, and cousins all napping naked in the living room with open books covering their privates. Yes, if that is the family that you've come from then his eccentricities were reasonable. The, the, ah, unique society of his brain cells was more than a little different from mine. But let's say we granted one another the most favored nation status. When asked about the secret to our decades-long wed, I sometimes used to tease that we only stay together for the sake of the children. Each was the other's child and we were both wordsmiths, cuddle-mad, and extremely playful. But who can say why two people become what we call a couple, that small principality of mutual protection and regard? Couples after all are jigsaw puzzles that hang together by touching in just enough points. They're never total fits or misfits. In time, a pair invents its own commonwealth complete with anthems, rituals, and linggos. I sometimes think that it's really a religious cult of two but with fallible gods. Our household was absolutely in drenched in word play. He had published nearly 50 books by then and I was writing obsessively. We confided and we bantered and we relished word games, we read each other's manuscripts, we develop books, ah, devoured books of all sorts. Each day Paul made up little songs about me, they were domestic apparatus, really, and I'm not going to sing any to you. I do include some of them in the Hundred Names. And, uhm, he would make them up, they were really, ah, tributes to domestic sudsy life. Uhm, as he walked around the house he had lots of pet names for me. I had dozens of pet names for him too, we also spoke in baby talk, animal sounds, silly rhymes like moleskin mountain in the fountain or sarcastic puns like welcome to the cirque du oy vey. Sometimes we talked in Pig Latin or R.A.F. slang, ah, we tried very often to make sentences in which all of the words rhyme or as many as possible. So, I remember one of them was in the middle ages the sage pages rampage in stages. Another one was the virgin's sturgeon needs no urge on. We lived in American society but we live within the culture and the family of words. For 30 years, Paul thought fiction writing and also contemporary European and Latin American literature at Penn State. He was infamous for making his students' brains hurt from the strain of learning how to juggle complex ideas. In addition to being a college and county cricket player in his youth and an R.A.F. officer whose job was to lecture and giving good lectures, he garnered several degrees including, ah, first, ah, class honors degree from Oxford, one of only four given in that year and he had a draper's touch for the unfolding fabric of a sentence. He collected unusual words as if they were rare buttons. Then one day after we've been together for 34 years there was a lightning strike. First, he was in a hospital with what seemed to be an innocent kidney infection. Trailing plastic tubes, Paul made his way across the room steeped in twilight and I was amazed by how the body sometimes looks like the sea creature it really is. A jelly fish with long tentacles and, well, not really a fish at all but a gelatinous animal full of hidden symmetries as well as lagoons and sewers and lots of spongy and stringy bits but mainly salt water. Logging tubes and cables, he had joined the hospital's bloom of deep-sea creatures but all that would soon change because he had been cleared to go home the next day and, ah, we were excited abrout-- about it and he said, "We escaped a dawn," in his best British sergeant major voice. The prospect made us both a little giddy but then a few minutes later Paul shuffled out of the bathroom and stood at the foot of the bed, his eyes were glazed, his face looked like fallen mud, his mouth drooped to the right and he looked asleep though his eyes were wide open and staring at me. In alarm, "What's wrong?" I asked. He moved his lips a little making a sound between a buzz and a murmur and for a moment I had the very odd thought that he might have a mouthful of bees. And then my spine filled with ice, that's exactly what it felt like and it also felt like the floor had dropped 20 feet. A decade before he'd had a TIA which, uhm, is a brief stoppage of blood flow to the brain and you get stroke like symptoms but usually they go away and I recognized this kind of buzzing speech and rigid face. "Anything but that," I thought, "not now, not again." The test reveal that Paul had a massive stroke, one that was tailored to his own private hell. In the cruelest of ironies for a man whose entire life revolved around language and who was married to woman whose live revolved around language too, he had suffered immense damage to only the key language areas of the brain. He could no longer process language in any form whatsoever. It's called global aphasia and for me Paul's aphasia was indeed global, it included our whole world. I'd never heard the expression before and I didn't want to think about the full cartography of loss that I was facing and yet I had no choice because someone was going to have to make decisions about his care, informed decisions, clear-headed decisions. Where was the tutelary angel who should descend at such times and restore the everydayness of things. I felt, personally, acutely unqualified. I hadn't volunteered for this job and I never would have given how much was at stake. I didn't want to be responsible for a loved one's life. Sitting in his hospital room while Paul was enduring tests floors below, I pictured him in my mind's eye glowing red with warmth as he was being wheeled through the chilly corridors of the hospital basement going from one imagine site to another. I could track his travels as if I were pied piper sensing his heat through tunnels underground. I felt very much alone scolded by my own ineptitude and I remember clearly thinking, "Well, forget about angels. Where are the grownups when you really need one?" I knew his plight wasn't unique, Paul was now among about 6 million stroke survivors and of those he joined the ranks of over a million Americans who are living with aphasia all the time. Aphasia is a frustrating, perpetual, tip of the tongue memory loss. It's, ah, jumbler of lives. But it's not really the loss of language because the words are all in their, they tend to crowd each other to come up and as in Touritte-- ah, Tourette Syndrome very often it's just the wrong words that can work their way out. Suddenly his lifetime of words had vanished. He couldn't speak or read, he no longer understood anything that anyone said to him. Later that day when I crossed the threshold into his hospital room, I entered a world that was unfamiliar and there was an unfamiliar man lying in it. The man looked like Paul but he wore distorted scowl and he seemed to unhinge his whole body in many vain attempts to speak. He would reel upright and flex his shoulders at odd angles and flail his arms but all he could do was utter just one syllable, "mem". "Hi, honey," I said trying to rally a small smile from somewhere in the cold pit of my belly. Paul kept fidgeting in a vain attempt to master all the aggregate parts of his being and he just kept spluttering "mem". When I didn't respond, he brought his clenched fist down on the bed railing and he repeated in loud italics, "Mem! Mem! Mem! Mem! Mem!" Paul would tell me later, years later that during the stroke he felt different than before. He felt that he was newly embedded inside of himself as if he was trapped in statuary. He's room, he said, seemed to be full of hopi dancers and it was dazzling as Mardi Gras, almost festive. He said he felt his teeth blinked. Something pagan was going on with a mad ring to it like disturbed vibraphone. People were speaking of foreign language and they didn't seemed to understand the pandemonium light show that was going on inside of his brain. I know now that that kind of Alice in Wonderland warping of the senses is very common place, not just, uhm, when the stroke is taking place but all different kinds of head injuries as well because the brain is desperately trying to make sense of its surroundings. When I tried to wrap an arm around him, he threw it off. "I'm here. I'm with you," I said softly. He struggle to respond and then he spat out a little sound. He kept wrestling and the more words alluded him, the more frustrated he became until his temper boiled. His face flushed, his jaw opened and closed in silent damnation as if it was all my fault, his eyes darted around the room. At last, he glared at me with his pupils that were tiny and hard as biddies and he just clenched his fist again and said, "Mem, mem, mem, mem." Fixed on the idea of home, Paul soon began trying to escape from the hospital. With his hospital gown flapping open in the back and his face tufted from wretched attempts of shaving and his hair in a kind of cyclone on top because he didn't really know how to comb it, he waited until the col seemed clear and then he would take wing down the hallway, shambling and weaving at speed and subversively looking for an exit though he had no idea really where they were located. Once like a deluded Magellan, he circumnavigated the whole floor almost making it to the elevators before a nurse and an aid captured him and let him trumpeting back to bed. Several days later, despite his lack of coordination, he managed to wiggle out of his hospital gown and you know how they have little clips that sent off alarms but somehow he did it without setting off the alarm. He put his loafers on the wrong feet and he absconded naked down the hallway sliding along the wall like this as if he were hanging wallpaper as he was going. Noncompliant was the term the nurses used about Paul. The rebellious patient in room 252, the running man. Paul lived in the hospital's rehabilitation unit for weeks re-learning the kinds of everyday feats of daily life that we take for granted. How to sit down in a chair, you know, it was almost as if the physics of the planet had changed and, uhm, the world suddenly was spinning so fast that you couldn't be sure the chair was still gonna be where you left it. And so he was feeling around for it. How to swallow food, how to comb his hair, how to stir a spoon, how to use the toilet, how to walk upright without falling over. Arduous work with physical therapists brought back some balance and dexterity and then just a few words started returning to him Helter Skelter including one that he really obsessed over and he most often would say it in a plea, "home." In time, Paul left the hospital for what's been, uhm, about a 10-year odyssey now of re-learning language on his part and caregiving on mine. At some point in all of our lives we will become a caregiver of a spouse or a grandparent or a parent or a child or we're going to be cared for by loved ones. If you live long enough, that's what happens. You see one side of it or the other or both. The challenge is to try to find a way to do that with grace, ingenuity, laughter, patience, and most of all love. While at the same time avoiding the danger of allowing the illness to become more of a presence in the household than your partner is and that can happen. Stroke changes everyone in the family. One normally plays so many roles from paramour to parent, monkey baby, prom queen, warrior, florist, nosey parker, servant, savant, and a dozen more. I'd not only lost the old Paul, I'd lost those parts of myself that had related to those irretrievable parts of him. For instance, the Escher-like paradox that each being the other's child, that was no longer true and it felt lopsided. A caregiver is changed by the culture of illness just as we're changed by the dynamic era in which we all live. I don't have as much time for reflection as I did before. I missed the, uhm, absence-- ah, I missed the language, conversation, the banter that I had before and I worry more since I'm so much a part of the evolving saga of his health which I have to monitor very closely everyday. But it's not all negative. Caregiving also offers so many fringe benefits including the sheer sensory delight of nourishing and grooming, sharing and playing, especially if you approach it with, ah, strong sense of mindfulness and presence. There's something uniquely fulfilling about being a lodestar and feeling so deeply needed and I find it fun trying to find creative ways to gladden a loved one's heart. I know that I've grown stronger in every aspect of my own life, one does. Coming to terms with being responsible for someone else's life took a long while and, uhm, I admit there were times, many times when I even felt that I might be breaking down. Overwhelmed, I fear that I was either going to have to give up my career as an author and just take care of Paul or feel like a total monster and have my career but not take care of Paul. My challenge was to find a way to see beyond either or and be both a loving caregiver of Paul while also nourishing myself. At first, I only managed it by compartmentalizing. There was my life, his life, work life, play life, house life, and then finally I learned to embrace it all as a whole. Then for the most part, on most days, it became seamless and I could just live life. Stroke is the number one long-term disability in the U.S. and it touches nearly every family but as you know there are so many other kinds of traumatic brain injuries. Uhm, I think at the last count there were half a million young soldiers who have come back from war now with, uhm, all different kinds of brain injuries and to families who are gonna have to learn somehow how to cope with it. Paul went through five noble-hearted speech therapist and they were all using the same standard workbooks and methods and none of them could help him at all. He would dutifully join a speech therapist in the library, we have a little library in the house everyday and then he'd emerge completely exhausted and demoralized having punished his brain for an hour trying to fill in blanks, list words within categories, how many flowers, ah, do you name-- can you name? None. How many fruits can you name? None. Or link words with pictures and try to perform other language skills. Despite their simplicity, he found the exercises not just demanding but incredibly condescending and at times quite impossible. So, I took a look at the workbooks to see exactly what the people in his situation were being encouraged to learn from. Can bowls swim? A workbook question asked. I knew the answer they wanted, obviously, was no but, you know, bowls can float, even heavy bowls if they're flattened large enough. The large flat bottom bowl of n ocean liner for an example. If Paul thought like that too then he'd give the wrong answer and he would be told that he had made a mistake. They meant small inanimate household bowls, not the bowl of a deep ocean, for example. Holding water currents, coral plants, and creatures and itself floating on the earth's liquid core of iron and nickel whose swaying produces earth's magnetic field. Not the bowl of the earth floating in space. Can water freeze? Well, that one was easy but some of the questions required only the literal meaning of a word and not the way that we use it in slang. Can bullets grow? One of the questions was. Well, certain kinds of bullets explode, they grow on impact. Can pearls fly? If someone throws them. Can beavers talk? Hey, you know, in the 1950s Ipana toothpaste commercials beaver sang. Is a siren loud? Air raid sirens, sure. Does seductive bird ladies of Greek mythology who lured sailors to their doom, not necessarily. Can bags frown? Bags frown all the time especially if you fill them up unevenly. Choosing the correct answer for somebody like him could be as hard as hurting cats. Even if he understood all the words and I really wasn't sure that he did, he was too imaginative for this kind of, ah, one size fits all exercise which required a completely different kind of habit of mind. And then one day when he was on speech therapist number five, I happened to be walking through the, the library just as she was showing him, uhm, a card that had a telephone sitting on a table. And she pointed to the telephone and she said, "What's this?" And he said, "Mem, mem, mem, skylargle." And she said, "No, that's a nonsense word. It's a telephone and what's this?" and, ah, she pointed, ah, I'm sorry, that was to the table. And then she pointed to the telephone and said, "What's this?" And he said, uhm, "Mem, mem, mem, tesseract," and she said, "No, that's also a nonsense word." And, ah, it really struck me and I turned on my heel and I walk back in and I said, "You know, I don't mean to interfere but tesseract real word. It is a three-dimensional object unfolded into the fourth dimension," and in a funny way that's what a telephone does. And I, I, you know, I get chills even now thinking about that moment remembering it because I realized right then that it was entirely possible that the words that we learn as children, mom, milk, sky, whatever, ah, make it indeed get processed in the, ah, certain language areas of the brain that we expect them to be processed in. But it's also possible that the words that you learn as a grown up or in a specialty get processed somewhere else as if they were another language. And I started listening to him very carefully. He couldn't say words like truck but he could say pantechnicon and at that point I took over his therapy and, ah, started making up, uhm, very personalized exercises for him. And I thought just keep his language mill turning, that's a key. I had just finished writing a poetics of the brain An Alchemy of Mind and so I knew, uhm, about neuroplasticity and I thought I need to keep him knee deep in language every second of the day. So, one way or another, from waking until bed time, I tried to just surround him with words. I talk to him throughout the day slowly in short sentences whether he understood them or not, I encouraged him to talk and I gave him yards and yards of time to responds, I hired a really cute 30-year-old nursing student as a home health aide, a self-described chatterbox and I asked her to swim with Paul for two hours each day talking nonstop and telling him stories about her life and to wear her bikini. I thought it would help him pay attention which, of course, it did. And then she would leave and I would take over talking. By the way, 10 years later, this wo-- wonderful woman, Liz(ph), is still with us. She happens to be living in D.C. now, we live in Ithaca, New York, a latter-day hippie community which I love, uhm, ah, but she comes up one week every month and she has continued to do this because she has now evolved into his literary assistant and painterly assistant. And she has remained a part of-- important part of the family. I soon discovered in Paul's therapy how incredibly important it was for him to be able to tell his story. In order to make sense of his life again, it was crucial. He couldn't re-inhabit his life if he didn't know what the story was. And so after a couple of months, even though he still really couldn't speak well, I suggested that he might want to dictate even with agonizing slowness and frustration his memories of being in the hospital. It took a long time but he did it. Ultimately, he published it, it's call the Shadow Factory and I encouraged him to watch television, especially movies. I suggested that he try writing the first aphasic novel. I thought that would give him a good goal. Uhm, I created very silly personalized fill in the blanks mad lead typed homework for him and, ah, they would be funny, ah, they involved opportunities for his strength which was creativity so he was being asked to fill out stories and make up, ah, totally absurd things that could happen to people especially people that he encountered in a day-to-day basis, that he might have some kind of submerged emotions about that he would want to get out. Uhm, when I had him fill in the blank when Mary(ph), one of the speech therapist, sits down on the couch she and he had written "explodes". Uhm, so it was a very, ah, offbeat kind of therapy. We were doing all of these things and one thing that really depressed him that he conveyed to Liz(ph) is that he couldn't remember any of his pet names for me and he used to have so many. He was sad about that and I felt sad that he could no longer describe things in rich detail. He had been a real Joycean kind of wordsmith before and now I would look out at the sky with him and I'd say, "Look at the sky, it's beautiful, isn't it?" And he'd nod and I'd say, "What color is it?" And he'd say, "Blue," and I'd say, "What shade of blue?" and he'd say, "Blue." So, that was very disturbing and so I thought, ah, I don't wanna feel quite as alone with my synesthesia as I do. With all of these things, I will encourage him to make up a slew of new pet names and that's, that's what I did. Using the colorful combinations, remember I told you that the aphasia just tumbles out. So, instead of fighting it, I suggested that what he do was try to get his wheel going and edit it as it was coming out, just the tiniest amount starting with a-- just a shred, just a tickle so that he could twist it into a pet name and then increasingly he got better and better at it and they-- he did one a day for a hundred days which is where the name of the book comes from. And they are absolutely wild and wonderful and I, I just have to share some with you. Spy elf of the morning hallelujahs, dream hobbit, singing squirrel of the antipodes, dark-eyed junco, my little bunko, now here's a really odd one. My bid-- my billiard table of the decaying gods. I said any--- and this is an endearment, right, you know. My little spice owl, my snowy Tanganyika, the epistle of Paul to the Romanian song threshers, little moon skipper of the tumbleweed factory, rheostat of sentimental dreaming. You can see that-- remember there are these big words in there, a romantic little dew sipper and so-- and my, my all time favorite, of course, is my little bucket of hair. Yeah. Well, of course, we would laugh at these and the minute you start laughing, that alone starts a wonderful cascade of closeness and healing itself because the first thing that disappears when there is serious illness going on is the sense of humor and play. And that's so much a part of the glue that you need to hold yourselves together as a couple. Because of my, my brain studies, as I say, uhm, I knew that what we learn when we're growing up that brains are rigid and unchangeable just isn't true, that they're plastic, and in a nutshell that meant that I should have hope. I knew that unused neurons, even neurons that were being used for other purposes could be drafted, ah, to help when a brain is damaged through injury. I also knew that it was going to mean really long, hard work. Ah, for both Paul and me, that it would be a marathon effort. Almost everyone that I knew, doctors, friends, everybody suggested earnestly that I move him into a nursing home and the phrase they would use was "get on with my life." People who were under 40 tended to say things like if, if they were in this position they would bail out or one woman said, "It's not what I signed up for." And so I would most often hear this extraordinary thing about relationships that they are disposable in this way and that when the universe changes you don't adapt because of your love and commitment to the person. I, I, I was stunned. It was nothing that I could certainly acce-- accept. Instead what I did was just keep the wonder of neuroplasticity in mind and keep faith and now it's been nearly 10 years since that stroke and thanks to hard work, love, and the brain's gift for rewiring itself, he's re-loomed vibrant carpets of vocabulary and after a few years, really, Paul and I we're able to talk to each other again. Sometimes in roundabout ways or by playing 20 questions, we still play 20 questions, I still sometimes quite often have to say what's the first letter of the word and just work with him to find out what he's saying. Sometimes it's like code breaking, others it's completely smooth sailing. Aphasia still with him with its merry dances and its occasionally missed adverbs and verbs and its automatically repeated words or phrases. He can't use a computer, he never could in all fairness, he can, ah, he can't type, he's taught himself to write and to paint with his left hand, ah, he's mainly in a wheelchair these days though he can get in and out of it by himself and get in and out of the pool and so on, he has a lot of trouble reading his own hand writing so he's always gonna need an assistant for a few hours each day. We often remember with a shiver those early days in the hospital when life felt small as a news and I thought it was the end of our long love story. But what I discovered instead is that it was only the beginning of a really fascinating new chapter. Here's, ah, ah, one other fascinating aspect of it that I found. After about six years, I just happened to walk in when he was looking at two manuscript pages side by side. How many people here have someone in the family who's had a stroke? Show your hands, an enormous number of people. So a lot of you know that very often you lose the right quadrant of vision in the stroke and that he did too so you didn't anything that's on the right hand margin. It's just gone. But when I walked in, I saw him looking from one page to the other back and forth and not even having to hold his place. I had bought him a Jewish yad, a pointer, finger, so that he could follow lines with it, he didn't need that or anything. He had rewired his brain to be able to see farther over into that obliterated section. We no longer worry about his recovering of his getting better. We don't regard aphasia as a process that has stages. Our life is different but sweet and if often devolves to absolutely hilarious charades as he tries to pin a word down like a lepidopterist with a handful of oysters, such hilarious things can tumble from an aphasic's mouth. One of my favorites was the day that I said, "Uhm, you know, I'm feeling so tired today, dear. I don't know what it is," and he said, uhm, "Maybe your brain has been requisitioned by a higher force," by which he meant I've been paying too much attention to him, you know, and gotten tired. Or, uhm, he couldn't remember the word for computer so he said, "You know, the light dancing mailbox." That would also be a normal kind of thing for a chimpanzee learning language to put together. It was really interesting to see, uhm, how the re-learning of language and metaphor was building itself. Uhm, one morning while working in my study, I heard the low whisking rumble of the bedroom door opening and was followed by footsteps and then he appeared in my study door looking naked as wombat, as usual, and he said, "Where's my cantilever of light?" And I smiled because this was a new one and I said, "Cantilever of light? Ah, do you mean your velour jogging suit?" He said, "Yes." I said it's in the laundry room. Okay, so why did his brain produced cantilever of light when he was searching for velour jogging suit? How or why or when might that be a cantilever of light? Cantilevers are rigid as jogging suit is soft. Cantilevers support bridges, uhm, unless he was thinking of his clothes as some sort of soft bridge to the daylight world which seemed to a reach, but the phrase really captivated us and it made us laugh all the time because we realized that we just been together for so long that I instinctively knew that cantilever of light had to mean velour jogging suit. I mean, all of the nonsensical verbal puzzles living with Paul at times feels like living with a koan, one of those, ah, Buddhist's psychic nuts for contemplation that are inaccessible to reason, uhm, and they are taught to spend time with, to meditate with. Even to begin to interpret a koan, you have to shed the cords of logic, bend language, dismiss conceptual ways of thinking and give yourself over to intuition. Talking with someone who is aphasic who live in a kind of similar state of perpetually, ah, realizing and of enjoying the "Aha!" moment that comes with solving a verbal puzzle. Like creativity, it invites you to muscle into the world while simultaneously letting go of it. Paul's stroke has greatly changed him but not all for the bad. I think he's probably the happiest that I have ever known him to be. It's also changed me but I think that's the secret to any long marriage, it's not really one marriage it-- but several. If you stay together long enough, you're going to encounter, uhm, different events, different growth, your life as a couple evolves. To thrive, you have to embrace all of the changes including both the highlights and the deepest shadows. When a began writing a Hunderd Names For Love several years later I couldn't write it at the moment that it was taking place. I was too traumatized to be able to write it. I needed, uhm, a couple of years but-- and then every evening Paul would come to me and he would asked me to read to him out loud what I had written that day. It provided an opening for us to talk about my hurts, my experiences as well as his and also about our history and our life together. A life like an intricately woven fabric or a basket, something that nonetheless has become frayed, and worn, broken, unraveled, reworked, re-knit for many of its original pieces and put back together again in a new form. As a result, it drew us closer than we've ever been. Life can survive in the constant shadow of illness but the shadow remains and one has to make a space for it. Emotions often provide a dark italics to our lives because they can lead to growth. We don't always avoid them. George MacDonald writes in Phantastes "Afterwards I learned that the best way to manage some kinds of painful thoughts is to dare them to do their worst, to let them lie and not gnaw at you heart till they're tired and you find you still have a residue of life they cannot kill." Surprisingly, the stroke has brought Paul a new caliber of happiness, one that's based much less on striving and careering and much more on the sheer joy of being alive and being loved on a crazy blue planet and space. We unwrap one day at a time treating it as a star-spangled gift and so our duet continues to evolve and even if we can't go back to that land of how it was, we're designing a good life for us inspite of everything. I know that I'm in the phase of life with very special responsibilities that I could not have imagined during my boy-crazy teen years when I thought that love was as simple as the Beatle song I Wanna Hold Your Hand. Like the teen years, this is also a passing phase. Be fully awake for it, I tell myself, pay attention to all of its feelings and sensations because there will be another era when Paul will be gone and, yes, you won't have the stresses or these worries but his being gone has been the unthinkable thought, the one that haunts each day, the worry of being left behind and alone that comes whenever you have an older or sick spouse. I know they were most likely be a long spell without him. I tell myself that I will be fine. On some of my daily walks, I sensed when Paul is gone, the trees and sky will still be beautiful, I will still be poignantly aware of life's trasients and how lucky I am to be alive on this crazy blue planet and space. It's all part of the adventure. Uhm, when Amelia Earhart crashed her plane in Newflin-- Newfoundland one time she managed to walk out with just a scrapes and unfortunately of-- there were all kinds of news people, the plane was totalled and one of the reporters came up and was talking to her about this and wasn't she upset and she just smiled at him and said, "It's all part of the adventure." I will still cherish being alive although I will miss him fiercely and oddly enough I would probably look back on these days as some of the happiest of my life despite all of the worries, frights, and, and impediments because I've loved heartily and really felt loved in return. The pet names continue and they flower and flow and flourish and they're funny and they're romantic and they're outlandish. Of late he's been calling me smooch owl and of late I don't why I've been calling him wombat-conniption. Sometimes it's wombat-smoothy, it just starts with wombat and gets hyphenated. But they're a testament to how a brain can repair itself and how a duet between two lovers can endure a hardship. A bell with a crack in it may not clear as clearly but it can ring sweetly. Thank you.

00:51:15
DIANE ACKERMAN Thank you, I'm so touched. Thank you for letting me share this extraordinary love story with you as well. If you have any questions, I will be dire-- ah, delighted to try to answer them and I also want to remind you to stop by the relationships first booth when you have chance. Uhm, let's see if there are any questions. Yes. I think the microphone is not on so... A-- are we out of time, let's check. No, okay. Is the microphone on there? There you go. Did he ever tell me what "mem" meant? No, he never did. But, you know, a really interesting curiosity is that very often people are, after stroke, are left only able to say one syllable. This can be very embarrassing. The poet Baudelaire, when he had a stroke, could only say "goddamn" and unfortunately he was being looked after by nuns. Can you imagine what that was like? Yeah. So, it could be, ah, the last thing the brain is thinking, we just don't really know. 

00:52:45
 Question. 

00:52:45
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:52:45
 Could, could you just share with, ah, with us how could those who work with head injury who are professional been of more assistance to you? That is what is it that who with head injury could do to facilitate all that you have accomplished? 

00:53:05
DIANE ACKERMAN Ah, so he was asking if you didn't hear, what can people who are professionals who work with head injury, what can they do, ideally, to help facilitate growth? I think the single most important thing is to really get to understand what the background is of the person, what were the person's hobbies, business, interests beforehand. Uhm, the-- in other words, deal with the person as an individual. Maybe bring some people that he worked with. If Paul had not been able to return to, ah, writing, and he still writes aphasically though he does publish, uhm, because he had been involved with books for so much of his life I would have suggested maybe that he volunteer at a library or something because there would be all of this memory - mental memory, body memory of being around the books and it-- and that playing, a really important part of his life. And, ah, people coming from his area of expertise might be able to find words that could get through to him. Uhm, so I know you know but people who aren't professionals who just happened to have somebody who has a stroke in their family, I think it's really easy to mistakenly believe that the person doesn't have much going on through-- in his brain at the time. And because Paul uniquely was able to tell me later what had been happening I realized that his brain was absolutely full and then, in fact, he was able to tell me that at the time of the stroke and for a long time afterwards, I asked him, "Do you still have that voice that we all talked to, the voice in your head?" He said he had three all of a sudden. And that one was a BBC announcer that he grew up hearing in his childhood, one was a, uhm, an American, slangy American, and one was a barbarian, ah, which is how he saw himself after the stroke and that when he was really struggling to find the words sometimes the BBC announcer would hand it to him. So there are so much creatively that can be going on that it really is worth trying to find interesting ways, I think art is a splendid way, ah, to be trying to get through also to someone who's had a head injury. 

00:55:50
 Thank you. You're an inspiration to all of us. 

00:55:50
DIANE ACKERMAN Thank you. 

00:55:55
[sil.] 

00:56:00
 Ah, I go with that last comment, ah, I'm, I'm aware that people with head injuries especially intimates, ah, often come cross to their caregivers as angry, paranoid, suspicious. 

00:56:10
DIANE ACKERMAN They do. 

00:56:10
 Ah, and I'm wondering how you as a caregiver were able to manage containing the, the containment of all of those emotions. 

00:56:20
DIANE ACKERMAN You know, at first it was very, ah, it was very confusing and very distressing. Uhm, pretty early on I, I made a separation mentally between the illness and the person and if you can train yourself to focus in that way-- in other words, I knew it wasn't bad character on his part that he was acting in this way. I knew that it was this illness that was doing it. So from my perspective it was like dealing, let's say, with a child, special needs child. I knew that he couldn't help that and I feel the same way now. He's in a wheelchair, I have to do a lot of things for him, I'd become much to expert on taking blood and doing all the test and all of that but I don't feel resentment or anything like that, something gets diffused in the brain. The minute you start reframing it in this other way, it, it takes the, uhm, emotional response out of it and also pretty early on I said, "I know that you didn't mean to hurt me, but when you just yelled at me like that you hurt me," and he conveyed he wasn't really yelling at me, you know how this goes, he gets displaced. Uhm, so those two things took some training on my part, I think, it took a while but were so worth it. 

00:57:55
[sil.] 

00:57:55
 Uhm, I was... 

00:58:00
 Thank you. Uhm, I'd-- I'm over here. Question. 

00:58:00
DIANE ACKERMAN Oh, there you are. 

00:58:05
 Thank you very much. Was what you read, ah, this evening in the book that you, ah, hundred words, hasn't been published as... 

00:58:10
DIANE ACKERMAN A lot of it was, ah, came from A Hundred Names For Love, ah, from different parts - 

00:58:15
 Uh-huh. 

00:58:15
DIANE ACKERMAN - and then I, uhm, wove it together with other observations and, and thoughts and things like that. Yeah. I told the story in the Hundred Names For Love and a kind of interesting aside is that I originally wrote the book as a pretty sad memoir, I think, uhm, kind of like C.S. Lewis' Grief Observed if you've read that which is a beautiful book. Uhm, and my editor said, "Well, this is lovely dear. But, you know, what I'd like you to do is write a hundred new pages into the first 50 pages and make them all scenes - 

00:58:55
 Hmm. 

00:58:55
DIANE ACKERMAN - and I realized at that time that I had resisted re-experiencing the drama of what I had gone through. And she was absolutely right and that in being-- it was important for him to tell a story but it was also important for me to tell the story of both of us too because the minute you start doing that, you impose an order and control on those memories and they're not as traumatic. You, you know, you can stir them a little bit. 

00:59:30
 Thank you. I just would really to have what you just wrote and wonder... 

00:59:35
DIANE ACKERMAN It's in the book. 

00:59:35
 It's in the book. Thank you. 

00:59:35
 Hello, over here. 

00:59:40
DIANE ACKERMAN Yes. 

00:59:40
 Two things. Uhm, one is I wonder if you can comment on the book by, ah, Jill Bolte the Stroke of Insight and whether your husband has, ah, read that with your-- whatever. The other is, uhm, the-- while you were talking early on, you were talking about word games - 

00:59:55
DIANE ACKERMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:00:00
 - I sent you an email while you were talking with a link to a word game that I think you're going to like. I just want you to know where it came from - 

01:00:05
DIANE ACKERMAN Okay. 

01:00:05
 - and I have something that goes with it that I'm gonna give you. 

01:00:10
DIANE ACKERMAN Good. Well, that's good. I love word games. 

01:00:10
 Ah, ah, oh. 

01:00:15
DIANE ACKERMAN I'm being given something. Okay. 

01:00:20
[sil.] 

01:00:20
DIANE ACKERMAN Thank you. Okay. 

01:00:25
 All right. 

01:00:25
DIANE ACKERMAN So... 

01:00:25
 One more question. 

01:00:25
DIANE ACKERMAN If it's very quick. 

01:00:30
 Yeah. 

01:00:30
DIANE ACKERMAN Okay. 

01:00:30
 I just wanna say thank you for your, uhm, perspective and this is definitely-- this session was for me rather than my clients and I personally, uhm, found a tall wavy-haired fellow six months ago and unfortunately he-- two months into our dating, he got his cancer, so I just wonder if you have any advice on my current relationships if we don't have that like time period that you've had to show that support. 

01:00:55
DIANE ACKERMAN Ah, I think one of the best things, ah, if you're in a very relationship - 

01:01:00
 Yeah. Early. 

01:01:00
DIANE ACKERMAN - to tell you the truth if you're not already is to be in therapy. 

01:01:05
 Absolutely. 

01:01:05
DIANE ACKERMAN Ah, because it's, it's critically important at this stage. We had, uhm, so much in common, we knew each other so well, there were so much we could take for granted and, ah, that made a big difference and I think also, ah, just realizing that all things are possible with love. It's a cliché but it's a cliché because it's true. And that relationships are worth fighting for. 

01:01:35
 Awesome. Thank you. 

01:01:40
