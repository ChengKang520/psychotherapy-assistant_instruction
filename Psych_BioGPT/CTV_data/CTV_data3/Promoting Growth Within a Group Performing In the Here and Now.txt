AMERICAN COUNSELING ASSOCIATION ALEXANDER STREET PRESS Group Work Academy Promoting Growth Within a Group: Performing in The Here and Now 

00:00:00
Samuel T. Gladding 

00:00:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Welcome. This is a demonstration on, uh, groups and promoting growth within a group setting. I'm Sam Gladding, and I'll introduce, uh, or let our members of our group introduce themselves in just a moment. In fact, let, let's let that moment be now. Uh, so... 

00:00:30
Nathaniel Ivers 

00:00:30
NATHANIEL IVERS All right. I'm Nathaniel Ivers. Uh, I'm a, an assistant professor at Wake Forest University. 

00:00:40
Jose Villalba 

00:00:40
JOSE VILLALBA I'm Jose Villalba. I'm an associate professor at Wake Forest. 

00:00:40
Marlene Estenson 

00:00:40
MARLENE ESTENSON I'm Marlene Estenson. I'm here in town at (inaudible) University. 

00:00:45
Brian Calhoun 

00:00:45
BRIAN CALHOUN I'm Brian Calhoun. I'm an instructor at Wake Forest University. 

00:00:50
Pamela Karr 

00:00:50
PAMELA KARR I'm Pamela Karr. I'm program manager at, guess where, Wake Forest University. 

00:00:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING 

00:00:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, as you can tell, this group is loaded. A lot of Wake Forest, but we have one outlyer here in Marlene, uh, who's never met people at, at Wake Forest before. This is unrehearsed, so we will see what develops. Uh, we want to allow time for questions and process toward the end. So, uh, if you're wondering, uh, will you get to ask a question if you want to, you will. We'll allow about 20 minutes, uh, for that. And I will repeat your questions, uh, if you, so, well, just for the sake of clarity. Okay? I want to, uh, preface what we're going to do today with just a few remarks. Basically, I really believe in the process of group and the power of group. I used not to, and I will tell you of my transformation and epiphany, uh, in regard to this. Once upon a time I was teaching at a community college. I thought that way that you taught was that you had notes and that you lectured. And that students would absorb and get your material through osmosis. And they would think, "What a great professor." However, I realized that my students were not exactly engaged with me. And one night this occurred to me. I must confess I have these dreams at times, and they usually enlighten me. And this dream was a particularly powerful dream as I realized that the class I had tought the day before had gone flat as a pancake without any yeast. And so what, uh, happened in the dream was this. That I was standing in front of the class as usual, uh, but I decided that I would get on the desk, uh, where, uh, I usually taught and that I would have basically the students line up. So, the students would line up. I would be on top like this, and, uh, Nate, if you would come over for just a moment. 

00:03:25
NATHANIEL IVERS In back of you? 

00:03:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yeah. The students, the students would line up, and they would come by just like ducks in a shooting gallery. Except when they got to me, they would raise their heads, open their mouths. I would put, uh, my notes on their, uh, right across their mouths. And then I had a ramrod, and I would just put it right down their gullet. And they would absorb it that way. So, after that I started using groups. And, uh, and, so that, that's my story of why groups I think are so important. There's a better learning experience, uh, many times than just through lecturing. When we look at groups I think we basically look at four types of groups, and you are aware that. We look at task groups. We look at educational groups. We look at counseling groups. And we look at therapy groups. This particular group were going to do today is more of a counseling group where those who are involved are working on areas in their lives that they want to improve. I think also we look at, excuse me, we look at stages in groups. We look at forming, storming, norming, performing and adjourning or mourning. Anything that ends with the -ing, that kind of, of sound, we, we look at that. And, uh, this particular group is going to be one that's in the performing stage, because we don't have time to do otherwise. Again, when we look at groups there are some things that I think we need to look at, and one is what techniques are we going to use, what processes are we going to use, and what we hope to accomplish in the group. There needs to be a goal, uh, at the end where we do something and so that we don't just talk. If you remember the lyrics from the rock group Meatloaf, they have a little lyric that says, "Baby, we could talk all night, but that ain't getting us nowhere." We want to get somewhere, or in the words of Michael Jackson in "The Wiz", "We want to ease on down, ease on down the road of life." So, there are a lot of things we can do. I've, uh, basically listed about 108 techniques that can be used in groups. We won't use but about 107 of those today. Actually, we want to use that many. We'll probably use a baker's dozen, around 13. So things that I would say that you might want to look for within the group are things like the executive function that I would have as a group leader, that is to set up the group and to get it moving and going. Caring, uh, that there is care that goes on within the group. There is, uh, encouragement by the group of other group members and certainly by me. There would, uh, be certainly empathy and goal setting. Kind of a here and now focus. Things can happen there and then but we want to work here now because that gets us to there and then and somewhere else. Joining with the group, linking group members with one another. These are things that I think you know, but I just want to remind you of and things that I hope to accomplish today. Making the rounds, making sure that everybody has some air time. If people don't have air time, uh, they just kind of let the air out, uh, some way or another through either being passive or, uh, passive aggressive. I'm from North Carolina, and we always say you don't have to be southern to be passive aggressive but it helps. So, a couple of other reflecting a feeling, reflecting of content. Silence. Silence is some times a very powerful thing, and we don't need to always be jumping in and trying to dictate what happens. Uh, and summarizing of course, which we will do at the end and using the power of the group itself rather than the group being dependent just on me as the leader. So, that's more than a baker's dozen, but, uh, you get a bonus for just being here. The last thing I would say is that I think all groups have a personality. There is a power in a group, and if so you can hear the group almost breathing. It's an entity. I mean, you, you can almost hear it breath. Uh, I don't think any of these people will be breathing that way, but, uh, it has a personality, and I want to respect to that personality that, that is the group. Last thing I would say is that I will try to model what I hope the group will do, and that is as the group leader I always think it's important, in fact I think the literature shows it's important, that when you ask someone to do something you do it yourself first rather than saying, "Pamela, be spontaneous." Uh, I would try to be spontaneous myself. Obviously you can't just be spontaneous. Uh, well, maybe you can, but, uh, I won't ask people to do something that I don't, uh, do first. So I will not let inappropriate behavior continue. I will try to model, uh, behavior. And sometimes I will use hand signals, uh, if needed, uh, using our whole body, our whole selves in a group can really make a difference in how the group functions. So, it's not just verbal. It's sometimes it's behavioral. And obviously cognitive in terms of assessing what's going on in the group. So this group is a growth group, a counseling group, a group that's working on areas that they want to improve in their lives, and we will begin the group, and then we will allow some time after we've done things for you to ask questions and to process the group. Uh, there won't be any that will be kind of , uh, hocus-pocus in terms of I'm gonna just pull out a trick here and throw it into the group. Rather, I will use, uh, group, uh, research, evidence-based research that says, uh, this is what you do in such a group. And I'm going to aim for the positive because we know that it's usually a five to one kind of ratio of people knowing things that are negative in their lives. And growth comes through, uh, not only eliminating the negative but emphasizing the positive. So with that, we will begin. And if I have my back to some of you, please forgive me, but,, uh, you get to see the beautiful people this way. And those of you unfortunate enough in this area, you get to see me. We're, uh, here today. We, we, we've been meeting before, and we've been looking at those things that we want to accomplish in our lives. And so one of those things that I want to do this morning as we kind of go around is to, uh, look with you at, uh, activities and events that have happened in your life just recently that have been significant for positive and then we will get into areas that we want to work on, uh, as individuals. And not that everyone will work on everything today, but hopefully the uniqueness of something you have may strike, uh, someone else as something they'd like to how and like to be working on. We'll also be helping each other in regard to, uh, growth. So, let's begin in terms of some air time with, uh, something that's happened significant or positive in your life, uh, this week. And I'd like for you to kind of scale it from 1 to 10 of how good it's been for you. So, I'll start. And basically, my wife would not believe this because I, I have very bland tastes, but I had a great meal last night with some friends. And it was probably one of the, uh, top 10 meals I've ever had in my life. And so, I would, and the friends were good and the wine was great. So, I would rate that's about an eight or nine because it was really just a fun and significant time. And why don't we go this way. Pamela? 

00:13:50
Pamela Karr 

00:13:50
PAMELA KARR Okay. Well, a week ago today I was finishing the last day of a week in St. Lucia, where I was pampered totally, and I didn't even turn my phone on much less try to check the Internet for a week. Now that was a 10. I can't even imagine how I could have improved on that except to have figured out how to stay there. 

00:14:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Got you. Brian? 

00:14:15
Brian Calhoun 

00:14:15
BRIAN CALHOUN I would say that the event that was really exciting this week, on Tuesday I won a call in show for some concert tickets. I was the 20th caller, and I got in. I'm really excited about it. So I'd rate that about eight. 

00:14:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING About an eight? Concert tickets. 

00:14:30
BRIAN CALHOUN Yes, exciting. 

00:14:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Good. Marlene? 

00:14:35
Marlene Estenson 

00:14:35
MARLENE ESTENSON I went to Columbus to visit a friend that I haven't seen in a long time. And so I got to spend the night there and just catch up with her. And I would say that was a good nine. It was really enjoyable. 

00:14:45
Jose Villalba 

00:14:45
JOSE VILLALBA Yeah, I would say last week I spent some time with my wife in Dallas. We hadn't been out without our kids for a long time, and so we spent about four or five days in Dallas at a conference. It was good just to spend time, the two of us. We missed our kids, but not that much. And that was about an 11. 

00:15:05
Nathaniel Ivers 

00:15:05
NATHANIEL IVERS Mine's, uh, kid related as well. My, I have four children, and my youngest is 11 months. And, you know, she's gone and stages of how she sleeping, but, uh, for the past two months she's been waking up two or three times a night. It's just usually our kids haven't done that, but she did. But, last week she started sleeping completely through the night. And so, that's helping out a lot with all aspects of my life. But, I would call it kind of a seven at this point because I'm still catching up on sleep. 

00:15:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING It will take you several years. Well, uh, good. Everybody's had a chance to say a little something and to think of something that's been good in, in your life. I'm wondering what you might want to work on today? Again, I know that everyone's coming from a different place, but, uh, let, who would like to work on something today? And again, we can do a go around and see if there's something that's in common. So, in this case I will not lead. 

00:16:20
PAMELA KARR Well, I am a little worried in advance because after a week off I had two days in the office and then I came here. So I know what's waiting for me on Monday, and it's totally overwhelming. And it's all important, and I'm not sure. I'm just worried in advance. But I know I don't work really productively when I'm that worried in advance. 

00:16:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, being able to put it in perspective and to work through it and not to worry so much about it. 

00:16:55
PAMELA KARR Right. 

00:16:55
BRIAN CALHOUN I think the thing I want to work on is assertiveness. I just want to be more assertive at work. There are meetings that I go to, and I just want to have my voice heard. I'm having trouble doing that, uh, getting that confidence, I guess. 

00:17:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, finding your voice and finding your confidence to express your voice. 

00:17:15
BRIAN CALHOUN Yes. 

00:17:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. Marlene? 

00:17:15
MARLENE ESTENSON Uh, I just, you know, finished my dissertation as you know. And so, uh, I feel like I'm engaging with my family again at a different level because I, I've been in a certain role for the last three years with them. And now, while I've made a point to be there, it's been different. And now I would like to really, I'm back in the family, and I want to make sure especially my teenage daughters feel my presence even more than before. And yet, honor the fact that they are 16 and independent. 

00:17:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, reentering, uh, family and connecting, reconnecting. 

00:17:50
JOSE VILLALBA Yeah, mine's family related as well. Just, uh, striking a bit of the balance between work and home. And we all talked a little bit about that sometimes, about how hard it is to do that balancing. Last weekend was great, and part of what I'm stuck with is how do I re-create that on a regular basis, because it's all work and all kids all the time, which leaves little time for my wife and I. 

00:18:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Finding that space where you and your wife as well as doing your work. 

00:18:20
JOSE VILLALBA And being a dad. 

00:18:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yeah, and being a dad. Yeah. 

00:18:25
NATHANIEL IVERS Mine's very similar in nature. I have similar constraints. And lots of work opportunities that are out there. And then finding just individual time. After the neuroscience presentation I realized I need to do a little bit more exercising. Finding time for that. 

00:18:40
Samuel T. Gladding 

00:18:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Well, you know, humor will help you do that. But, yeah, so, so again finding time for you as well as for everything else that is on your plate. Okay. So, uh, who would like to, to delve deeper into an area that you are concerned about? 

00:19:10
[sil.] 

00:19:10
Pamela Karr 

00:19:10
PAMELA KARR Well, I will. Because one thing I realized is that I totally forgot about everything outside of work. I'm focused totally on, you know, we connected very well with my husband while we were away for a week together. And now I'm away again. And when I come back, I'm likely to pull a, push everything aside, full speed ahead, without the remembering exercise or any sort of balance. And because that's probably a pattern. Here we go. All right. Move everything out of the way. Lists galore and go. 

00:19:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Right. 

00:19:45
PAMELA KARR Frenzied. 

00:19:50
Jose Villalba 

00:19:50
JOSE VILLALBA Yeah, I agree too. I think we do a good job of compartmentalizing things. And every now and again, when you, uh, when you don't do that you get overwhelmed. You know, and so in your case it's, what do I do now to get it all back together? The same thing happens. It's how do you balance that out, and how do you keep from not focusing on one thing at a time. 

00:20:10
Nathaniel Ivers 

00:20:10
NATHANIEL IVERS You mentioned this earlier, and I have, I think it resonates with my own experiences. But when I, when I have a lot to do and my list of things is this big when I get into work, I'm the least productive ever. That's when I check my e-mails a hundred times. I have so much to do that I don't know where to start, and that can make it difficult. And then I tell myself, "Well, I can have fun after I get these things done", which also makes me least, less productive I think." 

00:20:45
MARLENE ESTENSON It does sound like that's common with all of us in many ways. 

00:20:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING It sounds like it is. That, that people really are trying to strike a balance between the work and the other relationships, uh, in, in life without one tipping the scale this way or that way. And, and in your case and I think I hear it from Nate and José and Marlene, and Brian to an extent too, that that's really important to be able to create to that balance. So, so let me, let me ask and let's use the power of the group that's here. How have you found ways to do that in the past? What has worked for you in not letting one dominates the other and outweigh it? 

00:21:50
NATHANIEL IVERS For me, uh, I, it was some years ago, but I actually TO this schedule for an event. So it was on the schedule, and I was, I was committed to someone else, so I couldn't just put it this side because it was my own thing. But it was actually kind of I'm taking ownership of this, but it was actually my wife who signed me up for a tennis league. And, uh, in being part of that league, I had to play tennis because it was scheduled. And then I found myself a whole lot more productive, but I just have to remind myself of that, because I, just going out and setting up these things on my own sometimes feel like, well, if I do this then I won't have time for that. 

00:22:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Maybe that connects a little with what Brian was saying about being assertive in your life. And even though yours was a little different than that about being assertive in meetings, it's maybe being assertive with yourself and making, putting it on the schedule so that you will, uh, do it. What else has worked for people? 

00:22:55
Marlene Estenson 

00:22:55
MARLENE ESTENSON I, I had two thoughts. One is that I in the past I have always tried to make a list of my priorities, you know, and my relationships are higher, uh, then my work. And, uh, try to keep that close to me and look at it regularly. That's been helpful to me. And the other thing is to be proactive I've at times looked at just telling those around me who I know it's going to affect, like I, I did do this for the last two years and say, "This is what I'm doing. Do we all know about it, and we are all on board with it. And this is what it's going to mean and look like. But, there will be an end." And communicate that regularly. And that, I think that was helpful. 

00:23:40
PAMELA KARR It sounds like, I mean, it's really important to be able to say to yourself, "Temporarily this may have to be really really paid attention to, but there will be a time where I can get more balance." 

00:23:55
MARLENE ESTENSON Right, with your project. 

00:23:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And again, calling in allies, uh, using others to remind you, hey, this is what I'm going to do. 

00:24:05
PAMELA KARR And promising not to cut their heads off when they say it. 

00:24:10
Samuel T. Gladding 

00:24:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING I don't think we went to there about cutting their heads off, but appreciating them, uh, that they are letting us know that there's someplace we want to go and that it does have an end, uh, as well as a meaning, uh, in, for the present. 

00:24:35
JOSE VILLALBA One of the things that you said was telling yourself, so I engage a bit in self talk and trying to get rid of those defeating thoughts that I have sometimes. So with this inability to strike a balance, guilt comes up. And guilt just kind of festers. And so what I try to do to balance it out is don't be so hard on yourself. Don't beat yourself up about it. If you can't find that balance, it's okay. Otherwise, the guilt just builds up. So, so I've worked a lot on self talk, and that's a bit of a CBT approach, but it works for me just to kind of tell myself it's going to be okay. Sometimes it has to happen that way, and it is what it is. Otherwise, I end up feeling guilty, and I'm not balanced, and that's really really bad. So. 

00:25:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, basically talking to yourself in a very positive way is what I need to do. And this is what I can do. 

00:25:25
JOSE VILLALBA Right, right. 

00:25:30
PAMELA KARR And while I hate to take, you know, it's like Sunday, I can work all day Sunday to get ready to make it easier for myself on Monday, uh, maybe taking some time to get the exercise figured out would be helpful. And some time to figure out, to remind myself the self stuff I always tell other people. You can't do it all in one day. You cannot do it all in one day. Just focus on what's important, and then when something else comes up make a decision. Is this more important than what I decided is important. And at least have a list, even if you throw it on the floor. I think getting a little plan would help me. Right now I have none. I've been too off-off. 

00:26:15
Brian Calhoun 

00:26:15
BRIAN CALHOUN And I think exercise is really important. I make three days my exercise days during the week. I think it's just good to be regimented. So you're talking about Sunday being a day of exercise. 

00:26:30
PAMELA KARR Right. And usually I'm lucky enough that we have a dog, and I think if you have a dog you will go on walks more in the morning, because you can't say no to that face. And I was thinking, well I probably won't do any of my walking or my exercise this week because I need to get in there and get going. But, I'll rethink that strategy. Even if I'm there at nine, I'll probably be a better nine then a early worried eight. Maybe? 

00:26:55
MARLENE ESTENSON I find too that if you, for me, if I, uh, remind myself during the day that I'm not going to deprive myself for a whole week if I have a project like you're talking about or I will be very frustrated. So like you say, take the walk or the things that you want to do. Make sure that you get them in. But even just like using my special coffee cup in the morning or taking two minutes to read a comic or something, something that I'm going to enjoy but consciously choose to make it by nine. 

00:27:30
PAMELA KARR I can still do my Suduko? 

00:27:30
MARLENE ESTENSON Yes, exactly. I do them all the time. I find that's helpful to me, so I'm not waiting a week to do that. 

00:27:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, giving yourself permission to do some things. Prioritizing is one thing I think you mentioned but didn't say the word. And, again realizing that it can't all be done in the snap of, of your fingers. That walking is important. Suduko, well, okay, somewhat important for, for just having a little recreation, uh, in your life. Yeah. 

00:28:10
NATHANIEL IVERS Brian, can I, you said you exercise three days a week. You set that time aside. Can you tell me a little bit more? 

00:28:20
BRIAN CALHOUN Well, I think it's just, I, I kind of play off of your schedule. Making a schedule or making a day. I just say to myself, I'm going to take three days, and I'm going to work out on those three days, and make that the minimum. Now, if I go over three that's good, and it helps with the balance of the stressing in the workplace. 

00:28:40
PAMELA KARR Do you put it on your calendar like he... 

00:28:40
BRIAN CALHOUN I do put it on my calendar. I put it on the fridge. I actually put in the calendar on the fridge, and I can say Monday, Wednesday, Friday I'm going to run. And, I'm going to run for 20 minutes. And if I go over that it's great. But, yeah, making that schedule. I think, that's what you mentioned as well, making a day. 

00:28:55
PAMELA KARR It seems that even if you put your own appointments on there, it seems to make you do it, doesn't it? More? Oh well, but then you have to look ahead to see if it's going to rain that day or not. 

00:29:05
BRIAN CALHOUN That's right. But, you try to make up for it. So, if it rains on Wednesday, you go on Thursday. 

00:29:15
PAMELA KARR Flexibility. 

00:29:15
BRIAN CALHOUN Flexibility. 

00:29:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Does that help? 

00:29:20
NATHANIEL IVERS Yeah, that does help. I, you answered both my questions. One was how do you do that and what do you do? It sounds like running is what you do. Yeah. 

00:29:30
Samuel T. Gladding 

00:29:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, if I can summarize some, uh, what we've come up with as a group has been some self talk, some writing out and prioritizing what it is, uh, we want to do, some reminders, and having some allies with friends and family who can help you and to reinforce you in, in what you want to do. What else am I leaving out that you said? 

00:30:00
MARLENE ESTENSON To have a wife that schedules it for you. 

00:30:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING To have a wife that schedules it for you. That would be good, or, or a significant other, a main squeeze of, of some type. A partner, yeah, who again can help, help you, uh, do that. And self talk, reminding again yourself this is what I'm going to do. But Pamela, coming back to you, how does, and, and realizing these things don't happen in one day. That you can't make up for everything in one day, and that you need some recreation along the way as well as work and other things that you're planning. How, tell us how this resonates with you. 

00:30:55
PAMELA KARR Well, it kind of helps me put things a little more in perspective. I do feel calmer, honestly and truly. Maybe my shoulders have quit being like this, and they are more like that. 

00:31:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. 

00:31:05
PAMELA KARR So, thank you. It's, uh, kind of like the book "Everything You Learned in Kindergarten" you know, I know all these things. I had just kind of forgotten about them. 

00:31:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, you feel physically more relaxed. Mentally? 

00:31:20
PAMELA KARR Yeah, it's not quite spinning as fast, no. 

00:31:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. 

00:31:25
PAMELA KARR It's got a plan. 

00:31:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay, and so what will happen when you go back? 

00:31:35
PAMELA KARR I think that, uh, a plane ride of a couple of hours is a pretty good opportunity to take my day timer and try to think about when could I exercise, even though I won't be able to look up the weather. And, uh, and maybe just come up with a couple of the most importan t timewise, I mean that have to be done at a certain time. 

00:32:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. 

00:32:00
PAMELA KARR And try to, try to resolve to focus on those on, on Monday. To remember that I just went to a Covey course on five choices, in which it really had me take a look at my overall purposes in life that can included personals and read those again and try to remind myself what's important in the long run. And that the activities I'm choosing support those goals I wrote for myself. I haven't looked at that again since I wrote it. I think that would help me to go back again and try to make a plan. 

00:32:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. So, one of the things I like to do when thinking about moving from here and now into the future is kind of like they do in Hollywood, not like they do in Hollywood in terms of their lifestyles, but what did they do in Hollywood in regard to making films. So, it's kind of like scene one, scene two, uh, scene three. How do you, uh, see yourself? What, what are some ways that you could play out your, your life in regard to what you do and, so scene one would be or production one would be, what would you do? 

00:33:30
PAMELA KARR Look at the week as a whole. 

00:33:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. 

00:33:35
PAMELA KARR And try to spread out the big rocks. The big rocks are the big things I have to do, not the 20 million, no telling how many e-mails are going to be sitting there. Eek. 

00:33:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. Scene two. 

00:33:50
PAMELA KARR Schedule, uh, whether I'm going to do weights or, uh, walk in the mornings so that I can get back on that track. Scene three, I think this would be over the top, but I'll probably go ahead and make my typical menu plan for the week so that when I get home I know what I want to buy from the grocery store, and I can stop pigging out. And get back on healthier choice plan. 

00:34:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay, okay. So, you've got at least three choices. 

00:34:25
PAMELA KARR Right. 

00:34:25
Samuel T. Gladding 

00:34:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And I think when we look at growth and, and personally and in a group, it's always good to have more than one choice. And if you can have two, if you could have three, if you could have four then you have some options. And if you have choices, you can make changes. But, if you don't have choices, uh, you won't have those abilities to make many changes. So, are you, are you fine with what we've done? 

00:35:05
PAMELA KARR Yeah, thanks. 

00:35:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING We have time for another if somebody would like to. Brian? 

00:35:15
Brian Calhoun 

00:35:15
BRIAN CALHOUN I noticed something in myself, and Nate had to really draw me out to flush out my idea. I just didn't feel like I was assertive enough in helping Pam more with her, kind of, setting up the calendar for the athletic event or kind of a stress reliever. I just want to work on that, I guess. I think Nate for, for doing that. Just helping me kind of flush out my answer. I, I do want to work on that assertiveness piece, that I do have some good ideas that I could help Pamela with, but I just kind of wait too long. 

00:35:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, do you want to work on tha t assertiveness piece now? 

00:35:50
BRIAN CALHOUN I would it if it would be, if the group would it now. 

00:35:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING How's the group? I see heads nodding affirmatively. Well, let's talk about exactly what you'd like to work on, Brian. 

00:36:05
BRIAN CALHOUN I think I want to work on fleshing out ideas. I think I could help you out a lot more in group if I just articulate better and think about what's important to you and not be afraid to say it. And, I think that's something that I just need to work on. And, yeah. 

00:36:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, what keeps you from, uh, saying what you'd like to say? 

00:36:30
BRIAN CALHOUN I think I'm afraid that when I say it people might judge me, that I'm not saying the right thing or now that's what I have to say isn't that important. So, yeah. 

00:36:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay, and it's more with Pamela more than anyone else? 

00:36:45
BRIAN CALHOUN I think it's just in my whole, you know, life. It's, I do have important things to say. I just want to have that confidence to be able to say it and put it out there. 

00:36:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. 

00:36:50
Marlene Estenson 

00:36:50
MARLENE ESTENSON That's interesting because I found myself wanting to pull you out. And, and maybe that's my personality, but because you're so quiet I wanted to say I was worried about him, and I wanted, I was hoping we would have time to go back to. We had more in common with other things we were talking about then you're assertiveness issue. So, how are you feeling about the assertiveness issue? And I wonder if other people around you find that too, that they have to pull you out or want to pull you out because of your quietness. Because I think you have a lot of good things to say probably. I don't know you that well, but I would imagine so. 

00:37:25
BRIAN CALHOUN I, I feel like I am quiet, and I was thankful that Nate kind of pulled an answer out of me. I think I could've said more during that, during that time. I think you were saying that. 

00:37:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, Nate helped pull things out. 

00:37:45
BRIAN CALHOUN Most, most definitely. It was things that were going on, thoughts of what I could give to Pamela. And he really did notice that, and I appreciate that about this group. He did do that. 

00:37:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Let's try an experiment , uh, or an experience. So, uh, Nate, would you be willing to pull things out of Brian? 

00:38:05
NATHANIEL IVERS I'll give it a try. 

00:38:05
NATHANIEL IVERS Okay. Let's, let's try it. If you maybe stand up, and we'll have the group observed. And, uh, I'll just kind of be the coach here. So, uh, basically, uh, Brian, uh, if you would let Nate, uh, you know what you'd like for him to pull out, maybe that would be, uh, helpful. You've got all these things here. Which one do you, do you want him to pull out? 

00:38:35
BRIAN CALHOUN Well, just things that I do to relieve stress and get more work/life balance. What works for me. 

00:38:40
NATHANIEL IVERS Okay. So I didn't, do I need to tell the group? 

00:38:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Uh, how, how would you pull that out? 

00:38:50
NATHANIEL IVERS How would I pull it? Well, I would ask for specifics. 

00:38:50
BRIAN CALHOUN Okay. 

00:38:50
NATHANIEL IVERS Can you tell me specifically what you're doing and how that's helpful? 

00:38:55
BRIAN CALHOUN Well, I noticed that she talked about the Franklin Covey, the scheduling. I also have done the Franklin Covey course and know about what you do to kind of prioritize projects and relieve stress. And I didn't feel confident enough to tell her in the moment. 

00:39:10
NATHANIEL IVERS How has it helped you? 

00:39:10
BRIAN CALHOUN It's helped me to let her know that I share that kind of scheduling thing, and we could talk about it in group and help her more with her work/life balance. 

00:39:20
NATHANIEL IVERS Right. Anything specific about the Franklin Covey scheduling that has been beneficial? 

00:39:30
BRIAN CALHOUN It relieves my anxiousness, and I think it would do the same thing for you, Pamela, just to know that I've done it, and I can show you what I do. So, I appreciate you kind of pulling that out of me. So. 

00:39:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, if it were, uh, a box or something, and there were tools in that box, what, what tools would you want? 

00:39:50
BRIAN CALHOUN Well, I'd hand him my Franklin Covey planner to Nate here to look at for himself as well. He, he mentioned he wanted to schedule time as well. I think all of us in the group have that, we need to schedule and make priorities in our lives. José, with his wife. Marlene, you, you mentioned you wanted to schedule more time. And Pamela, that was her main issue, so definitely we could do that. 

00:40:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, it's not just Nate pulling something out of you. You're giving something to him also that, and to José and to to Marlene and, and to Pamela that, that you have. 

00:40:35
BRIAN CALHOUN Most definitely. And it's useful, and I want to share that with the group and to Nate. 

00:40:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And, is there one or two specifics that you could give him? 

00:40:45
BRIAN CALHOUN I would say, uh, just set everything. Write it down. We mentioned Pamela doing Suduko. I'd take about 10 minutes in the day, and that's what I'd give to you. I'd say at the beginning of the day I do 10 minutes where I just sit and work on my schedule. And then I work on my priorities. And that's what I, that's piece I would give. It's more information-based. 

00:41:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, here's something I'd like for you to do. Nate, if you could hold out your hands like that. And Brian, if you could, uh, give him that. And Nate, you can set it there. Uh, well, wait. Too anxious. Okay. So what I'd like to do. Sometimes when we are in a group, we talk about things that are happening, but we don't kind of get it into the marrow of our bones. And we don't get it into behaviors. So, an enactment where you actually give him, uh, these things that you've talked about. He receives them. He can set them down, and you could give him one or two more depending on how many you have. He's helped you. Now, you're helping him. 

00:42:00
BRIAN CALHOUN So, this is just the knowledge that I have, that works for me and just give it to him? 

00:42:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yes. Well, well but, but say it. 

00:42:10
BRIAN CALHOUN Okay. 

00:42:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING It's like, you know. 

00:42:10
BRIAN CALHOUN This is my scheduling. This helps me with my work/life balance. 

00:42:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And, what. Okay. Okay. Specificity. 

00:42:20
BRIAN CALHOUN Okay. 

00:42:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, uh, being specific in terms of, of what you're giving him. And you can give him small gifts. Uh, you know, a screwdriver is as helpful as the hammer sometimes. And so, you can give him small gifts and then he can, he can't receive them. 

00:42:40
BRIAN CALHOUN Okay. Well, this is going to help you with stress. Would that be a good thing? He mentioned working out more or planning. 

00:42:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING The planner. 

00:42:50
BRIAN CALHOUN The planner to work out. 

00:42:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Uh, Nate or Nathaniel, uh, I'm giving you a planner. 

00:43:00
BRIAN CALHOUN Nate, I'm giving you a planner. 

00:43:00
NATHANIEL IVERS Thank you. 

00:43:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING What else would you like to give him? 

00:43:05
NATHANIEL IVERS I need more. 

00:43:10
BRIAN CALHOUN You need more? I will give you my watch. 

00:43:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Some time. Okay? 

00:43:20
BRIAN CALHOUN I will give you different colored markers to prioritize your plan. 

00:43:25
NATHANIEL IVERS I need those too. That's good. Thank you. 

00:43:25
BRIAN CALHOUN I will give you running shoes to do more athletic events and grow that mind. 

00:43:30
NATHANIEL IVERS I don't have any more room on my chair. 

00:43:35
BRIAN CALHOUN So, have I given him enoug h or do I need to give them more? 

00:43:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Do you have more to give him? 

00:43:40
BRIAN CALHOUN I always, that's the problem. I have more to give, but I don't know when to... 

00:43:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING It, it's okay to keep giving. He, he looks like he can take it. 

00:43:50
BRIAN CALHOUN Okay. 

00:43:50
NATHANIEL IVERS I could use it. 

00:43:50
BRIAN CALHOUN I have a picture that helps with my mindfulness that will help when you're doing your planner, just to be mindful of putting your schedule together. It's a big picture. 

00:44:00
NATHANIEL IVERS Okay. 

00:44:00
BRIAN CALHOUN It's a very peaceful scene. That's, that's what I have today. 

00:44:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING That's what you have to give him. And since the giving is always a two way street, uh, he's mentioned things that you've given him in terms of reminders. Do you have anything else that you would like to give Brian? 

00:44:20
NATHANIEL IVERS No, I think the only thing that I would like to give you is just the, I don't know, the, that, that confidence to give, just to be specific. So here's some specificity right here for you. 

00:44:30
BRIAN CALHOUN Thank you. 

00:44:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And, and you said and some confidence. 

00:44:35
NATHANIEL IVERS Yes. 

00:44:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, how does confidence look? 

00:44:40
NATHANIEL IVERS I think it looks like what Pamela did. From this to that. 

00:44:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay, so we're, we're all from Missouri here. If you could show us. 

00:44:50
NATHANIEL IVERS The show me state? 

00:44:55
[sil.] 

00:44:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So. 

00:44:55
NATHANIEL IVERS I think it's as if being open, opening up. 

00:45:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Oh, okay. So. And once you receive it now, uh, how do you look in terms of confidence. 

00:45:10
BRIAN CALHOUN Well, my back is more arched, and I feel a little more confident because of it. It's just good to have that visual and receive it from Nate and to see it in Pamela and to be able to know that I can have that same feeling, that same confidence. 

00:45:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. Does that resonate with you in terms of what? Everybody? Okay. So, you've each given and received. It sounds like a marriage ceremony, but, but it's not. But yeah, it's a friendship. And it's a, uh, also, uh, a building block in terms of something that you want to do. Again, uh, it's not just in our minds or in our voice, but it's in our behavior, uh, as well and in our feeling, uh, and let me just ask both of you what do you feel at this point? 

00:46:05
Brian Calhoun 

00:46:05
BRIAN CALHOUN Well, I literally feel like a weight has been taken off my shoulders just to be able to, to talk and share with Nate and give him those gifts. Uh, it feels good. I, I do feel more confident. I feel my back is a little more arched then when we started group. 

00:46:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. So, you're, you're more, your, you feel it in your body. 

00:46:30
BRIAN CALHOUN Most definitely. 

00:46:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Nate? 

00:46:30
Nathaniel Ivers 

00:46:30
NATHANIEL IVERS Well, I, I like what Brian gave me in particular. I, I like what he said about taking 10 minutes every day. I know Brian a little, and I know he's highly productive. He gets a lot done, has a lot on his plate. Uh, and one of my issues sometimes is if I take 10 minutes to plan, I lose 10 minutes to work. And I think, but again, I think if I give myself that time, I can be more productive as well. And so, I'm taking back with me. His modeling as well as his ideas I think are really helpful. And so, I think what I'm feeling is energy. 

00:47:05
Samuel T. Gladding 

00:47:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay . Energy. Okay. Good. Good. So, uh, Pamela, Brian, we've got, uh, bodies that are, uh, a little bit different in terms of feeling the weight off your shoulder I think you said and feeling, uh, your back arched a little better and more confident there. And with, uh, Nathaniel ordinate, which we will call them both, uh, feeling energized, uh, and, and that's the feeling inside. That, that I've got some energy that, uh, that I didn't have before. 

00:47:45
NATHANIEL IVERS Yes. 

00:47:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING What else, uh, as we are moving in this group. We probably have time for one more, uh, person to, to do some work. 

00:48:00
MARLENE ESTENSON I, I just want to say I also got something out of the two of you do that because you came up with, you know, shared the idea of a picture. And I thought, I can use that too. I like the picture idea. 

00:48:15
BRIAN CALHOUN It is very peaceful just to look and to have something that's, you know, set your mind at ease when you are doing that. 

00:48:20
MARLENE ESTENSON So, thank you. 

00:48:25
BRIAN CALHOUN You're welcome. 

00:48:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And, and the picture you have Marlene? 

00:48:25
Marlene Estenson 

00:48:25
MARLENE ESTENSON Well, I like the peaceful scene. I like that always, but, uh, a picture of my daughter's right now would be what I would use in terms of again engaging back with my family. Uh, would be a way to remind myself every day, priority. What am I doing today that does that? I would like that particularly. 

00:48:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. So, you can image that picture, and what does that do for you in terms of a feeling, uh, or a behavior? 

00:49:00
MARLENE ESTENSON Uh, well, I have twin 16-year-olds, so they, one picture in particular came to my mind immediately was one where they were dressed for Halloween as clowns. And it's just one of my favorite pictures of them. And, to have it to there is just a happy feeling. It's just a positive satisfying peaceful feeling of nurturance or something. For me. 

00:49:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. So, having that picture gives you a feeling of nurturance, and that leads to? 

00:49:30
MARLENE ESTENSON More balance, more awareness of my priorities. 

00:49:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. 

00:49:35
MARLENE ESTENSON And that's peaceful, to have a balance that we were talking about before. 

00:49:40
JOSE VILLALBA Right. 

00:49:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. Okay, so that's, that's a good... 

00:49:45
MARLENE ESTENSON That's a good thing. 

00:49:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING good gift you received. And, Brian gave it to you. 

00:49:50
MARLENE ESTENSON Right. 

00:49:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Do you want, do you want to hand off? 

00:49:55
MARLENE ESTENSON Thank you. 

00:49:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And I know sometimes it, it may feel just a little schmaltzy to, uh, be doing that, but again if you have like a ceremony or a ritual, then you remember it, uh, much better. It becomes much more a part of you than, uh, it does if you just say it. Yeah. 

00:50:20
Jose Villalba 

00:50:20
JOSE VILLALBA And, and just because it's schmaltzy doesn't mean it doesn't mean anything. One of the things that I've talked about would happen here today was it's tangible. You know you're talking about sneakers and, and dry eraser, but wait. You can see that. And that's a lot better than just talking about some of these more esoteric things. What is balance? I don't know what the balance is, but when you talk about a picture of your girls, I can see that. Yeah, so that's been helpful, schmaltzy or not, there is something that resonates when you can do something. Yeah. I like that. 

00:50:55
PAMELA KARR I have a gift I'd like to give José. 

00:50:55
JOSE VILLALBA What? 

00:50:55
Pamela Karr 

00:50:55
PAMELA KARR Uh, what you're talking about is, is how wonderful it was to have to have time with just your wife only and that you have three children. And the youngest is? 

00:51:05
JOSE VILLALBA One. 

00:51:05
PAMELA KARR One. And how hard that is to connect like you just were able to do. And so, my gift would be an idea that we used all through our marriage when our children were younger is that if there's somebody who can keep them, we tried to have a date. And that date was on Friday night. And that Friday night was not to be accepted any offers anywhere else. We just went out together by ourselves and had dinner. And somebody kept our , from one year old up, and even he knew it was our date night. But if, if there was a way to give you the gift of thinking about the date night... 

00:51:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING You can get up. 

00:51:40
PAMELA KARR You can have a date. And here's your calendar. It doesn't have to be Friday. But, it's something that's really neat about deliberately making that time. 

00:51:55
JOSE VILLALBA Thanks, Pamela. Yeah. 

00:52:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And again, the feeling that you might have? 

00:52:05
JOSE VILLALBA Well, the feeling is that's really a good idea, and that needs to get done. So, so it's almost like a commitment. So, the feeling I have is the determination to do something about that, to not just say that's a good idea but to go back, schedule it and do it. So, my feeling is more perseverance. Let's do this. Yeah. 

00:52:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. So kind of a resolve. 

00:52:25
JOSE VILLALBA Better word, resolve. 

00:52:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Well, I'm trying to reflect what you're saying. Uh, and, and that again you feel a little, uh, well, do you? 

00:52:40
JOSE VILLALBA Better. 

00:52:40
Samuel T. Gladding 

00:52:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING The better. Okay. I didn't want to put words in your mouth. But, yeah. So you're better. What else? We, we have about five minutes. I always want to make sure that you know, uh, when we're going to, uh, end. What else might there be that you would want to either give someone or, uh, that you want to make sure that you get a voice on before we, uh, end this group? 

00:53:10
BRIAN CALHOUN I noticed José re-gifted to Nate. 

00:53:20
JOSE VILLALBA Well, he took it. 

00:53:20
BRIAN CALHOUN He took it? 

00:53:20
JOSE VILLALBA Re-gifting and taking, fine line. 

00:53:25
BRIAN CALHOUN Can we, can we share the gifts with the whole group? Because I think... 

00:53:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Sure. 

00:53:30
BRIAN CALHOUN We, I, I'd like to have a picture and the date night and all that with my wife Is that's possible? 

00:53:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Sure. So, tell him what you're giving. 

00:53:40
PAMELA KARR Okay. On that planner, date night. 

00:53:45
BRIAN CALHOUN Okay. Thanks. 

00:53:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And, do you want to give Marlene anything? 

00:53:55
PAMELA KARR Would you like a date night too? 

00:53:55
MARLENE ESTENSON I would. That would be wonderful. 

00:53:55
PAMELA KARR It's great. 

00:53:55
MARLENE ESTENSON It would be very important. 

00:53:55
PAMELA KARR Nathaniel, how many children you have? 

00:54:00
NATHANIEL IVERS I have four. 

00:54:00
PAMELA KARR Here. 

00:54:00
NATHANIEL IVERS And I, I definitely took the date night. Thank you. 

00:54:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, there's no re-gifting here. You gave it directly. Other things? 

00:54:15
PAMELA KARR I want some of the calendar stuff. 

00:54:20
BRIAN CALHOUN You want the calendar stuff? Uh, well. 

00:54:20
PAMELA KARR You can share. Do you have more? 

00:54:20
BRIAN CALHOUN Uh, here's the calendar.

BRIAN CALHOUN Here are the running shoes. 

00:54:25
PAMELA KARR Okay. 

00:54:25

00:54:30
PAMELA KARR Oh, I like colored markers. 

00:54:30
BRIAN CALHOUN Here are some Post-it notes. 

00:54:30
PAMELA KARR All right. 

00:54:30
BRIAN CALHOUN And here is the picture. 

00:54:35
PAMELA KARR Thank you. 

00:54:35
BRIAN CALHOUN To look at when you're doing your scheduling. 

00:54:35
PAMELA KARR Thank you very much. 

00:54:40
BRIAN CALHOUN You're welcome. 

00:54:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, everybody's had a chance to say something and to work on something that's important, uh, for you. And, uh, it sounds like there's a lot of similarity even though there is a uniqueness in each. And that the gifts that you've given one another have some meaning, uh, for you and they matter. And again, that your have something that is transformed, not only in your mind but somewhat in your resolve and in your behavior. Am I hearing that right? 

00:55:20
MARLENE ESTENSON Yes. 

00:55:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, as, as we wind up and let the audience process with us, I'm wondering what are those things that you are taking away, because there are always takeaways, uh, from groups. Otherwise, it's just an experience, and, uh, those types of experiences are soon forgotten. Uh, so what are, what are you taking a way. We won't do a go round as such, but we'll let it be as you want to speak. 

00:55:55
BRIAN CALHOUN I'm going to speak first, because I feel like I have more confidence now. 

00:56:05
PAMELA KARR Yay. 

00:56:05
BRIAN CALHOUN And, and yeah. The shoulders are back that Nate gave to me from looking at you. I feel like I've received in this group. So. 

00:56:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And, you can have more than one take away. But if that's... 

00:56:15
BRIAN CALHOUN That's my main take away. 

00:56:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING That's your main take away. 

00:56:20
BRIAN CALHOUN That's really what I wanted to remember. 

00:56:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Just want to make sure you know you can have more than one. 

00:56:20
MARLENE ESTENSON I want to try to live in the moment, uh, and enjoy my life in the moment. And for me, I was thinking it's just a gift to have this experience, to get ideas and thoughts from all of you. It's a gift that I enjoyed in this last hour. 

00:56:40
JOSE VILLALBA My gift is clarity, again, the notion that these things aren't as complicated as we make him out to be sometimes. Set the date. Done. It's complicated because we have kids, but it doesn't mean that it can't be done. It's more of an excuse. So, clarity. That's my word. 

00:57:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Clarity. 

00:57:00
JOSE VILLALBA Yeah. Clarity. 

00:57:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. 

00:57:00
NATHANIEL IVERS Mine's energy. I've, uh, for some time now, I've been wanting to, had the desire to, uh, improve my exercise regimen, uh, but to the desire has not translated into action. And so, the energy is there and some of the concrete ideas are there as well, which I, I hope to start incorporating. 

00:57:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay, so it's not like you're a while the course just running wild. You, you have the energy, but you also have a direction. 

00:57:30
NATHANIEL IVERS Yes. Absolutely. 

00:57:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Good. 

00:57:30
PAMELA KARR I feel like I didn't, if, if you had said you're going to ask me about something I needed to work on, I was like oh no, I have to make something up. But, I didn't have to, and I really appreciated the help, uh, that I got going back into daily life. So, it's just another manic Monday. 

00:57:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, it won't be just a manic Monday. That you have a plan. 

00:58:00
PAMELA KARR That's right. 

00:58:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And you have... 

00:58:00
PAMELA KARR Will. 

00:58:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Again, some will, and you have some scenarios that you can either start this we are start that way or start that way. Yeah. And, and hopefully that, uh, kind of goes throughout the group in terms of realizing that you have options and how you exercise the options makes a difference in of how you behave and how you feel and what you think. Yeah. 

00:58:30
PAMELA KARR Yeah. 

00:58:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Anything else from anyone? Let me say, I've enjoyed working with you this morning. We didn't know exactly what would, uh, come about, but it does sound like a lot have come that's of a positive nature that you can build on that you've given and received gifts. And that your feeling and your manner and your behavior, uh, and even your thoughts are different than they were initially. So, uh, why don't we close this, get some feedback from the audience. I'll repeat their questions, and, uh, if they want to address you specifically, then, uh, feel free to, uh, go with that. So, let, let me stop and applaud you for what, uh, you've done, and let me turn to the audience for a moment and see, uh, questions, comments that, uh, that you might have in regard to what you've seen us do here. 

00:59:45
How do you politely stop one from speaking too long and have them focus? 

00:59:45
Samuel T. Gladding 

00:59:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING How do you stop someone? This group did not do that. They were polite. Uh, but, that's not every group member and every group. And so, we have people who, uh, seem to just run on and on and on. How do you stop them and get them to focus? So, uh, let me tell you how I do that, and others may want to chip in and also give you some feedback on that. But one of the things I do is I use my body. I didn't use it that much here, but I will use it at times to, uh, give signals to people. So, uh, this is a universal sign that everyone knows, uh, in terms of like timeout. 

01:00:35
PAMELA KARR Show them back there. 

01:00:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yeah. Yeah. Like this. Or, if, uh, if somebody is getting too close to someone. I might, you know, give them, uh, this kind of, of a signal like maybe not. But, I think sometimes we think that one of the, uh, basic things we have to do in group is to just use our voice. And I really do believe in using the body, and, uh, letting people know ahead of time, uh, because again if they don't know they may not respond. They may not respond anyway, and you may have to do more than, than what were saying here. Letting them know that, uh, there may be some signals, guys, that I need for you to respect. And then asking them, uh, in a, in a very, uh, constructive way, "John and Jane, I hear you saying a lot, but I'm not sure what the essence of that is. Could you put that into, uh, two or three sentences." And play with them, uh, in the, in the sense that there is a playfulness. Uh, it's serious, but play is always serious in terms of learning something. So asking them, uh, to do that and, uh, letting it go from there in terms of, of, of fewer words. And let's see then if members of the group can tell you what they heard. And so use the power of the group. Sometimes again we think it's all on our shoulders as a group leader, but the group is very powerful. And this group I think to demonstrate that in terms of what they were doing. 

01:02:35
How do you have groups who don't want to share their thoughts to speak? 

01:02:35
Samuel T. Gladding 

01:02:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, sometimes and let me repeat the question. So, uh, you have a girls group and a boys group. Girls group is fine. They talk. I mean, girls are great at doing this. Uh, boys, I mean I have three sons. They grunt. I can just tell you. The boys are grunters. Uh, girls seem to find words, uh, for what they are doing. But, so, the boys aren't talking. So some of the things I do, uh, for a group, and it's mandatory that the be there. I'm hearing you say that. So, some of the things I do to try to get the boys talking is, uh, I'll have a Nerf ball or, or something that we'll be passing around. And getting them warmed up. Uh, and one of the things I, I think this is important, is to make sure people have a warm-up. So, John, Jim, uh, Troy, whoever the person is, uh, what, you know, if you give them a warm-up like, "What would be your favorite food?" And boys are into food. Uh, I wouldn't go what's your favorite color, because they know black, blue, green. That's it. Uh, but, but something that you know they have some interest. Or what's your favorite sport or, or whatever to get them warmed up. And then sometimes you can actually do theme groups. So, I think I heard you say that the boys are always wanting to talk about sex or something. So, I mean, that's great, but that's not where they need to be. So let's talk about how you can be more successful or, but, how you can put your best foot forward. Uh, and you can even have them, uh, again, playing. Which is your best what? And, uh, what does that represent? And again , looking at the culture. Look at the development of the boys. If they are concrete thinkers, uh, you're not going to get them to say, "Oh, and this is what that represents." But, uh, and culturally again, we have to certainly respect that and be aware of that, but, uh, but using themes, uh, because they don't seem to be able to structure it for themselves. So, and there are some really good books here at the American Counseling Association Conference on favorite group techniques and they are theme related. So, that's where I'd go with that. 

01:05:20
Should student talk of deeper issues? How do you handle groups that and negatively? 

01:05:20
Samuel T. Gladding 

01:05:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING I think a group, uh, again has a life of its own. And some groups don't live as long or as well. Uh, and I don't mean to be flippant in, in saying that, but I do think that some groups are going to, uh, run shallow and run short in regard to what they do. And I am convinced that not every group needs to go that deep. That again, developmentally if people begin to feel safe, if they begin to trust, then the next time they are in a group and they may go a little deeper yet. And, uh, and so letting it be, uh, that's why I think is fine. And realizing that as the group leader, uh, I haven't failed the group. I've helped move them along. And next time they are in another group, they may feel enough trust to go a little deeper. And I may not even see that, uh, as, as the leader. So one thing I want to do when I find that a person is saying the group ended on a negative note. Or for me, I don't want to go back with those people is basically saying again as I've said to, uh, this group as we ended, what are your takeaways from that? So, what would you want to do differently, because you will be the leader next time. Or you'll be in a group next time. What would you want to take away, and what do you think you might do, uh, to make that different? I think anticipation is not just a word. It's a, it's a way that we begin to move, uh, in life and to realize I have some power as Brian has found out, uh, in terms of being assertive and anticipating some of the problems. And so, it's, uh, when I was courting my wife, I would always think, okay, and I know she thought this more than I did. If, if she says this, I'll say this. Uh, it's kind of silly, and it's amazing we've lasted 27 years. But, but anticipating what you, what you might to do to make it better. 

01:07:55
Is very different rationelle then starting on a positive note? 

01:07:55
Samuel T. Gladding 

01:07:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Most, uh, and we know this from the research that people know, uh, five negatives to every positive, uh, in their lives. And that seems to show up almost every research study, approximately back ratio. So, uh, it would be easier for them to tell me a negative. And, it would be easier for us to work on negatives. Allen Ivy and Mary Ivy, this morning, when they were talking at the ACA opening session , uh, talked about building on the positives rather than working on the problems. And, I think that's, uh, even though we didn't coordinate our session, I do think that it, it makes the group more alive. It makes it more constructive, and I've seen a lot of destructive groups as most of you have. And I don't want to go there. I don't want to set the stage. I think we set the stage, and I know we did a little acting out here, but it's, it's like if you set the stage, the actors and, uh, the play if you will or the group will come into more of a positive, uh, result at the end. 

01:09:15
What are some of the techniques for adolescents to be more willing to share in group conversations 

01:09:15
Samuel T. Gladding 

01:09:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, one of the things that I like to do at times is to get people on their feet and to do, uh, scenarios. Uh, and we didn't do it that much here, but if we did, we at least touched on it. So, uh, again, being the Missouri kind of person, uh, that you, you might be in terms of show me what, what might happen. What you might do. And let's run through three scenes. If you run through more than that, they run out of ideas usually. And, and then again, uh, working with the power of the group. Like Pamela might not know, but Marlene might or Jose might or Nate or, uh, Brian. And so, having them suggest things and to show other behaviors because again, "I don't know" is the best form of resistance out there, uh, and it doesn't really help anyone. And of course, it does help if you're doing it. But if the peers are helping out, I, I really look at the power of the group. And I really look at role plays and coping strategies that they might, uh, engage in. 

01:10:40
Is it best to go around the group and have every individual speak? 

01:10:40
Samuel T. Gladding 

01:10:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING I think if, if, uh, and I think the literature supports it more than not, uh, that if you have people having a voice that they can hear themselves, and if they can participate in a non-threatening we on a question or something that you might ask, that they are much more likely to participate then to, uh, frustrate themselves and you by not doing anything, uh, in, in "Happy Days" the Fonz would say, "Sit on it." Right? And some people sit on it, uh, in regard to they have feelings, but they don't feel like they can get their voice heard. So with Brian over here this morning to be more assertive, I would think it would be especially important that he get some air time. Uh, and again if you can get some airtime. And everybody has participated, then there's nobody that everyone is looking at as the identified, in family therapy, if the identified, uh, patient, as the outlier, as the outsider, as the person who really is either above or below. So, I, I really, uh, do think it's, it's one of the better skills we have in group work to make sure everyone gets a voice. And then they, they don't have to say anything after that. But at least they participated, uh, in, in this regard. 

01:12:20
Should you continue an unfinished topic at the following group session? 

01:12:20
Samuel T. Gladding 

01:12:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING I think, uh, again the thing to do, uh, is to ask the group as you go around, uh, "Have we finished everything? Is there something that we talked about last week that you'd like to work on? To clarify?" And again, people may say yes there is. A lot of times, no. But, but that way you're letting them know that you, uh, heard and what was happening last week, and you want to make sure that they're okay. There's nothing stronger than a broken gestalt. Uh, that is, people if you haven't finished something, people are going to get it in there, yeah, regardless of whether you give them permission or not. I used to work in a mental health center. I'd always give my clients permission to walk around, because I knew many of them were going to do that whether I gave them permission or not. It made me feel better. And, and it didn't make them feel any worse. Uh, but I, I'd start it with, uh, last week, summarizing, "Last week we talked about this, uh, and again, I'm wondering if there's any unfinished business about that." 

01:13:40
Was the gift giving exercise spontaneous? What was the reason for this exercise? 

01:13:40
Samuel T. Gladding 

01:13:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING It was somewhat spontaneous on my part, but let me tell you the rationale of why I did what I did. I thought that it was, that's what they were doing was a little, uh, too ambiguous, uh, and so I wanted to, uh, make it more concrete. One of the things that we do in counseling, group counseling and individual counseling, is we make the covert overt. And I wanted to make sure there was an overt display and an overt acceptance of what they, uh, were giving and receiving. And let me let them talk for themselves. Uh, Nathaniel and Brian. 

01:14:30
NATHANIEL IVERS For me it was very similar to what you're saying. I'll just piggyback on it. But, it's, it's easy to be ambiguous. It's easy to stay in kind of the abstract world. And, uh, this took some mental juices, uh, to think, okay, what exactly am I giving Brian? And, uh, and what do I do with what Brian is giving me. How do I bring Brian out was the thing that started that. And, and that was, that was hard work. And I may not have gone there without, uh, the prompt. 

01:14:55
BRIAN CALHOUN I want to speak to the change. I'm trying to work on the change of increasing my confidence. It was good just to move in the group and change position in the group and move over in that area and work with Nate giving gifts back and forth and having more explanation. Having those encouragers. Because I really didn't know what to give Nate, so that was very helpful in that position. 

01:15:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yeah. I wanted them to be as specific as they could, and so many times again, it's amorphous, uh, in terms of what people are wanting to share. So, trying to make it as concrete as we could so they really had a take away. 

01:15:35
How were you conceptualizing the whole group throughout the session? 

01:15:35
Samuel T. Gladding 

01:15:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING I was trying to see, uh, and you couldn't see because you're in back there, but I was trying to, uh, use my eyes to see what they were doing in terms of their behaviors, subtle or not in terms of, of overtness. I considered them an entity, so I wasn't working individually just with Pamela, Brian, Marlene, José, with Nathaniel. The group was an entity. They were the client, uh, if I can say it that way, which I just did. Uh, so, I wanted, uh, to see that everyone came out with something, and the group came out with something. So it was, it was a both/and rather than a either/or is, is another way to say that. But, I wanted to, uh, we talked earlier about negative group experiences. I wanted to make sure that this group was running in a, in a smooth a manner as possible and as positive a manner as possible. And that's the feeling that they've left with and their takeaways was, uh, elevated and different than when they may have come in, because I think we were all a little nervous. We had not rehearsed this. And one of the best ways we learn how to be good group leaders and good group members, uh, to be honest, is to see a group, uh, in action. And, so our takeaways, vicarious learning, uh, social psych stuff, that, how do you, how do you learn things. Well, modeling, seen people do it and realizing I could do it this way or I could do it that way. Or, I could do it another way. 

01:17:30
What resources do you use to keep current on group session techniques? 

01:17:30
Samuel T. Gladding 

01:17:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING I'm a card-carrying member of the Association for Specialists in Group Work, which is one of the divisions of the American Counseling Association. There's some, also some other, uh, good group behavior societies and other professional societies or associations, uh, but I go to their workshops, ISGW's workshops, Association Specialist Group Work, as much as I can. I read the literature, uh, because they publish a journal, and I read the journals also. I look at videos of people who are, who have run groups and do groups, uh, Gerry Corey(ph), Ed Jacobs, uh, others. I'll just give a shout out to my colleagues. There, they're good. I actually write about groups. If you get the book, "Little Timmy Can Have the Operation. It's Okay." So, I try to write about what's going on as well as to read, uh, about it. And, I try to journal. If I have a, uh, led a group, I try to Journal right after that just like case notes in an individual work. I'll do a journal about the group as a whole and any, uh, outstanding parts were people within it. We've come to the end of our time today, and I want to thank you, uh, for being here and being such a, a great audience. I hope you're going away with some things that you can learn, and, uh, and employ in groups that you lead. I will be around as with, as will members of this group if you want to talk with them, uh, even more. And, uh, thank you again for being here.
