DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS Hello, my name is Dr. Debbie Joffe Ellis. This is the third in a series of three DVDs about Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. If you're watching this one and haven't seen the previous two, welcome. And the main topic for today's DVD, today's segment is on being an effective empowering and compassionate therapist. But first I was asked to… to give a few words about what I do. So, I am a licensed Australian psychologist. I'm licensed as a mental health counselor in New York State. I write. Umm… I love to present and teach. I'm an adjunct professor at Columbia University, TC in New York City. And Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy or REBT for me is not only what I love to practice with others, teach to others, but it's also a way of life in the way I do my best to live my life. And so today, I'm going to share with you and with our audience here, some… some of the aspects that can contribute to our being an effective empowering and compassionate therapist. You know, there's a question. Does one need to practice what one preaches, in order to be an effective therapist? I… I in the past, I used to think about that. And my conclusion was and is no. I believe that even a parrot who can talk some words, can help a person stay on track. If… If a parrot can be taught to say, "What do you..." Well, it probably doesn't have a finger, but "What do..." however parrots talk, "What are you telling yourself to make yourself feel disturbed?" Then just the parrot's words alone might alert a motivated person to think about their thinking and then take responsibility for any disturbing emotions that they are creating and experiencing. I have known therapists who have affectedly helped clients, who in their personal lives and behavior have not practiced some of the things that they preached or recommended. And they were effective therapist. So, it's not necessary to practice what one preaches to be an effective therapist. But, I believe that for more of us in this field, more of the time, it's the better way to go. I think that when a therapist does his or her best to live their life, practicing the principles they recommend to others, there's a greater authenticity and by the way, stability that often other people including their clients can feel and… and can sense and that modeling can be a motivating force for the client or other person in their respective therapeutic or self-help journeys. Then, when we do our best to practice what we preach, the therapist or the human, that each of us is does seem to become more genuinely empathic and compassionate, balanced and stable. And finally, when the therapist is an inspiring model for the client, then that can be an image which reinforces for the client, what they have the potential to achieve more of. I'd like to share with you a recent experience that I had that relates to what I'm sharing with you now. I live in New York City right near the Hudson River and one of the things I love to do is to go for walks by the Hudson. And so some months ago, it didn't happen all that long ago, I was walking. Now there's a pedestrian path and… and it merges into a shared path for pedestrians and cyclists. So, I was walking on the pedestrian path and… and came to the path where the two paths appear for cyclists and pedestrians. And I saw coming towards me a cyclist speeding really, really fast and… and… and I felt as… thought that better be careful here. And so I moved to the farther most point of the pedestrian path and I stopped, I stood still. Well, my intuition proved correct. Despite my doing, what I thought might be most helpful to avoid being hit, I was hit. He came at high speed barreling into me. I flew back. The last thing, I remember thinking before I lost consciousness, was I don't have time to protect myself. Meaning if I had time, I would have fallen forward which in all probability, often causes less injury. Anyway, way smack back on, on concrete, I was out. Suffered concussion and… and when I regained consciousness, the cyclist, his credit was there. And he said, "Are you alright?" Well I kind of sat up to see if I was. And in fact I was. It was a lot of bleeding on my left side because that's sort of how I'd fallen as he came. And pain in… in the back of my head, huge bump, bleeding. Umm… And some sort of bit of dazed feeling. But I could see, I could feel nothing was broken. And I could hear him. And I could comprehend him. And the first emotion that I felt was one of gratitude, that it wasn't worth, that I wasn't hurt worse than that. "Well, are you alright?" he asked. And I said to him, as far as I remember very strongly, but I was not feeling any anger. I was not. "You'd better be more careful, you could have killed me, you could have killed yourself." And he… he starts saying "I know, I know, I'm sorry. It's my fault. I was wrong. I just get into a zone when I cycle." (inaudible ) And… And so at that point, I… I stood up to walk to a safer path of where we were. Umm… And I could walk again. I… I saw nothing was broken, I was relatively okay. And I thought, "How lucky I am. How lucky I am." So then he continues to apologize. He says, "What can I do?" And I love animals. So the first thing that came to mind was and I said this, "Give $50 to ASPCA." And he said, "I will, I will." And he puts his hand in his pocket and I said, "I don't want your money." And he said, "No I'm seeing if there is water. If there's money, I'll buy you some water." And he didn't have any money on him. I said, "It's okay." And… And he is just there by me and umm… he's tearful. And he again says, "I'm so sorry." And I felt compassion for him because even though I was in more physical pain, I really was, and it got stronger by the minute, umm… emotionally, I was just so glad that it wasn't worse. And glad that I was glad and grateful. And so I… I genuinely felt touched by his concern and I said, "Look, we all make mistakes." He wasn't expecting, you know, "Just be more careful next time." Then, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I will." And I got up to… to go home. I got up from where I was sitting. And… And… And he said, "Thank you. I've learned so much from you and I will be more careful and I'll give $50 to ASPCA." Okay, well, I went home and then later, you know, to the ER. It was pretty bad, you know. But I healed up and it took some months. I had post-concussive symptoms and all of that. A few days later, a woman walking in Central Park was killed by a speeding cyclist. And I was watching a TV program at the time with the bunch of women who comment about whatever's going on and other things and one of them was saying and I nearly got hit by a bike in Central Park. And if I could have… if he wasn't going so fast, I would have chase that B and I would have got him. I would have given him a piece of my mouth. And the audience is all yeah… And I thought, Wow! How sad? That it seems to be a very common attitude that if someone acts in a bad and reckless way, get the bastard. You know, give it to him. And I thought to myself, what a (inaudible ), that I didn't feel that way. Not that I have aspirations of being saintly or whatever, but it feels really good to feel grateful rather than enraged. And if one acts from rage by the way, one can often do something that can make a situation worse. And on a purely biological scientific basis, rage contributes to atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, other various physical complaints. How grateful I am and was, that I was able to initially see the good in what was a very bad and potentially dangerous situation. The reason I share this with you is it's not that I was born with the ability to just focus on what's good. I believe that yeah, I might have some genetic helpfulness going on, but also I've been practicing REBT for decades. And because of that, I'm in the habit of looking for what is good first. It's taken years for to become so second nature, perhaps even almost first nature to me. And it's an example of a person who works as a therapist having practiced what she preaches for a long time, enjoying the fruits of it and though this man is not, was not… And if… if he was, if there were bunch of people here and he was there, I may not even recognize him. But in my healthy response, I inadvertently, it seems contributed to another human being, in a beneficial way. And isn't that what most hopefully all of us, although all is kind of an overgeneralization which we try not to do in our ability, but isn't that… I would hope what most people who go into our profession want to contribute in a beneficial way. And why limit it to therapy, to the therapeutic clinical setting? Let it be also to the people on the street or in our lives. So, one of my main points in… in this umm… presentation about the beingness of the therapist is not only importantly, does it add or create a better quality of life for us as individuals, but it helps us contribute to others both in and outside of a clinical setting. How good is that? How good is that? By the way, in… in the current, and I don't know when you're watching this so current, at the time of taping is 2015, and what is it here? So in the APA Journal of spirituality in clinical practice, volume II, number one, pages 96 to 100, 2015 is the year we are currently in, I believe despite recent concussion. Umm… I… I'd write about that experience in more detail and more, if you want to read more about that. Okay, so back to the therapy session, back to the therapy session. What I'd like to share with you now is some of the pivotal points that are helpful to remember and apply in REBT sessions, in our roles as therapists. So, one of the first things that REBT encourages us and recommends that we do when the client first comes to us, is to clarify their issues and their therapeutic goals. It's not always and frankly very rare that a person, although it happens, will come in and say, "I suffer from anxiety and… and this is the specific situation. Can you help me with this?" Often there are co-occurring problems. Particularly people umm… with more intense emotional disturbances, people suffering from addictive tendencies and so forth, so it's not always that clear from the get go, what the issue is and often there isn't a "the issue". There may be a number of issues. So, it's very helpful to understand what the person has come to you for, at the same time be alert, be vigilant, be watchful, be thinking, be listening, to other issues that might be evidence of unhelpful tendencies, the client may not be conscious of having. You keep that in our list of to do's for them, at least to suggest to them, that can be worked on a particular time. So, to clarify and have goals, and goals that you and your client then can agree on that you work on together. And then through the course of therapy which for some maybe one session, for some three, for some 12 and for some with deeper issues, longer. But in the course of therapy as the therapist, to be flexible and vigilant and willing to modify the priorities as you might have thought them to be according to what the client brings in their now moments in sessions with you. Okay. So, step one clarify for your sake and for their sake and agree, as much as possible, on the goals, so that you have in… in the journey together. But ultimately remind them that they and only they are responsible for creating their own healthy emotional climate experience and wellbeing by making effort, by making effort, by making effort. Okay. Secondly, it's important to listen well and as much as possible to model REBT principles and practices, particularly unconditional other acceptance, empathy, loving kindness and compassion. Thirdly, helpful to be alert and direct guide against any tendency you might have to want or need to be liked and accepted by your client and get over it using REBT. Please make the client and I may, you know, probability be preaching to the conversion, but some of you are students. So I offer this as… as… as I think, healthy food to think about, healthy thoughts to think about. That umm… directness and honesty can be expressed in a way that has the highest chance of being received by the client. And there's not one way and one approach. You know, my husband, Albert Ellis had a particular way and he called a spade a spade and sometimes would swear with the intention of… of breaking up some rigid ideas in some of his clients minds. But he wasn't encouraging students and therapists to… to copy his approach. And certainly many, many times, I saw him with clients where he was gentle and softly(ph) clients in feeling deep grief, you know, we work together with people after the September 11, attacks in 2001, in New York City. And… And so what he did? What I do? What's helpful for an effective therapy to do is to model one's man… Excuse me, monitor and choose one's manner and style in the best interest of the client, as… as best as we can assist. As I've mentioned earlier, the best that we can do is the best that we can do according to what we're thinking at the time. So, then a very important part of REBT is it's psycho-educational component where we teach the client using language they understand. You know, if… if it's someone with Ph.D., we can bring in research and be more intellectual. With someone who's younger or less educated or… or less capable of understanding, more academic terms or whatnot, just speak in most simple language. REBT is very good for doing that. Because it's not complicated. Is it? From what you've heard so far, the people here have heard the… the past two classes, maybe you have as well, umm… it's not complex. It's straightforward. So, let's use language that the… the… client may be more receptive to. And when appropriate suggest reading or DVD material, know the variety of home works I shared with you in the last session, cognitive, behavioral and motive. And… And choose homework for them from that. And keep reminding the client, I suggest to, that… that… that lasting change requires ongoing effort, ongoing effort. When appropriate use humor to put things into perspective. Many of us and many of our clients may easily tend to take things too seriously. So, do your best to use humor when and as appropriate, according to your discernment. When giving homework at the end of each session, which an effective REBT therapist generally will do, discuss it with the client. Don't just say, "This is your homework." But here's what I suggest, "What do you think about this?" And listen if they say realistically, "I'm not sure." And then modify it, you know. So discuss together. You… You're the director as… as the therapist, but then, be willing to modify for the good of your client. If they're resistant to what you suggest, what good is it anyway? Then at the beginning of the next session, a good start, more often than not is to say, "Well, how did you go with your homework?" And if it hasn't been done, watch out that there is no tendency to sound judgmental or "Why not?" But unconditional other acceptance without being too namby pamby and "well, you know, let's… let's try and help you here, understand this. You helped us choose your homework. So what do you think?" Be investigators together on their journey. "What do you think, you were telling yourself that stopped you from doing the homework?" When you explore that and then once you've explored that go on to any other issues that the client will bring up that session. As I indicated, little earlier, but I… I'll repeat it again here, it's helpful to be flexible, willing to add additional, a new goals for the client. As the sessions move along and either more and helpful tendencies are revealed or there's been resolution about some of the goals, you know, there's been success. And that there may be other things that have emerged. So, be flexible and… and help them chart their growth full course. Be creative when suggesting homework. You know, I… I in the last segment gave quite a few suggestions inspired by those or with your own creativity, you may think of additional homework. See if the client has some good ideas. It's really helpful to be creative when looking for homework. REBT encourages us, the therapist, to be very encouraging of our clients, even when they haven't done their homework. Seek out something that you, genuine of course, that you can encourage them for and about. And again practice tolerance for any resistance or reluctance that they display. And… And be compassionate, empathic, but straight forward when pointing out the truth of what they may still be doing in a self-defeating way. Self disclosure. I think it has a very helpful place in therapy, but if and I believe, mainly if, I was going to say only, but then I thought about my thinking and that's a very absolutistic term. Self-disclose to help the client, not because you like the story or because you like talking about yourself. But if it's going to be helpful as part of you being a… a motivating or inspiring model. It shows that you're human too. It shows that progress is possible there, in life time, that you've been through this and… and here is the outcome, because you practice this homework or this philosophy. So self-disclose if and with the intention of helping the client. All right, so there are some of the pivotal points for successful REBT sessions. Now, as I've mentioned a few times in… in today's session or segment or gathering and… and in the previous two DVDs, REBT is not only an affective evidence based therapy, but it's also a way of life. And many people in our field and outside of our field, who aren't wanting or interested in having therapy, are being drawn to philosophies of Buddhism and Zen Buddhism, Mindfulness. Each of which have similarities and differences to REBT. Now the similarities, each of those approaches or philosophies that I've mentioned in REBT focus on the here and the now primarily. They are realistic as much as is humanly possible. Scientific, you know, that the Dalai Lama was quoted as saying some years ago, in… in a number of books and articles and in an article that was in the New York Times, that his form of Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism does honor the knowledge that science brings. And if something science proves is not in alignment with one of the elements of Tibetan Buddhism, then Tibetan Buddhism had better change. Showing his flexibility, you know. Al and the Dalai Lama had many things in common. Umm… I won't take time to go into it now. But if we have time during the question time, perhaps one of you, if you're interested can ask me about that. About talking now, about similarities and differences, that's one of the similarities that… that the approaches I mentioned in REBT honor the knowledge that science provides. And each of them and REBT encourage compassion and loving kindness. Now there are some stark differences as well. The approaches that I mentioned, not REBT have urgings to readers and students of… of those philosophies, to attain a state of nirvana, to strive for total cessation of negative impulses, to reach the perfect state is the goal of mankind, To quote one of them, to still the mind. And whilst these all sound like noble pursuits, REBT recognizes that some, if not all of them, may not be achievable for many humans in this lifetime. When they encourage people to still the mind, RET… REBT is skeptical that a mind can be completely stilled for long periods of time. And so what REBT emphasizes is the benefit and importance of healthy thinking rather than no thinking. And right now I'm… I'm working to complete a manuscript that Al and I started. Umm… He died before it was completed obviously on REBT in Buddhism. And… And so that will say more about that.

DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS I'd like to take a few minutes now to talk about the manner that a therapist can use according to the client and… and the issue or condition that he or her is wanting to… to work on and change for the better. With some clients, a very forthright, no nonsense manner, no BS(ph), might be more effective, in enabling them to be receptive to what you're saying and… and to feel more motivated to apply it. To other clients, especially in the initial stages such an attitude might actually have a repelling effect. So, be sensitive and do the best you can to a tune to where your client may be at. But being gentle does not imply, not being forthright. But you can choose your volume, your joke, your humor, your lack of crudity, your crudity, you're getting them to laugh, you're not necessarily using humor that session, again it's helpful for the most effective therapist to… to be very selective and mindful. Umm… September 11th, 2001, the attack on… on the World Trade Center and After that happened umm… Al and I saw clients, a few of them witnessed what happened, a few lost people during that attack. And umm… Al held some… some groups, you know, free to the public (inaudible ) anyone to attend. And also there was a place called Nino's. It had been a restaurant. And the owner, he was right near the World Trade Center and set it up as a drop-in place for recovery workers, and policemen, and firemen, and sanitation workers and their families. And they could come in any time, around the clock for something, to… to eat or drink and umm… revive and… and so, you know, I would work with Al till 10 pm and then I'd go there and do volunteer work till umm… 4 am or 5 am. It was an incredible time. Umm… And so at that time, my… my main duty there was… was to serve food. But a few people who knew what I did, called me the undercover shrink. Umm… I would listen to people and do my best to not sound like a psychologist or a therapist. And in fact mostly didn't tell anyone that I was, unless I was asked. And what seemed helpful for those people in a shocking situation was my listening, and empathizing, and normalizing and putting it in a perspective. And one of the ways, I did that, at times, when it felt appropriate, with a few of them, because I didn't do this with most of them. I was just there. We're talking now about a non-clinical session. But some of the people who asked, they knew what I did and asked for help, I would do my best to… to make, give suggestions. And so normalizing it by giving a healthy perspective, by talking about people, I knew who had survived horrors in their past of trauma and rape and in my parents' generation, the holocaust, and how they had survived, that it's doable. That you can choose to come through it, initially by going through the chapter of days and shock one moment at a time, a step at a time, normalizing, encouraging. And then as in the (inaudible ), encouraging unconditional self-acceptance. I don't like the expression post-traumatic stress disorder. The posttraumatic stress symptoms, you know, people coming back from serving this country, often if they have survived and their… their friends and… and colleagues have being killed, you know there is survivor guilt. So… So to encourage unconditional self-acceptance is very important at that time to normalizing an unconditional accept… (inaudible ) in life, very helpful for people suffering from post-traumatic stress. Similarly, when working with clients suffering grief or who are caring for dying loved ones or who are ageing and feeling bewildered, noticing loss of abilities, maybe some memory loss and they're aware of it. I also believe one of the main helpful emphasis that REBT reminds us that we can use these the normalizing and the unconditional acceptance. The reminder that even though things right now are so painful and tough, that if you're willing to keep pushing through and tolerating the discomfort, it can in all probability feel better. Yes, you may always be deprived of the one who's dying or has died. But let's see what else is in your life that can still bring you some meaning. You know, sometimes not always, I will use my own experience as an example. I mentioned in… in an earlier DVD, that at the end of Al's life, we went through a very difficult experience that felt shocking and brutal to each of us in our work environment. And… And that at the end of… of Al's life, you know, he was losing his health and… and the work situation was not ever to be resolved in our favor or even in any compromise that we would feel comfortable with. And yet we chose and remembered to still focus on what still was good at the end. And so this is something, I suggest to other people that it's doable. After Al died, there was a huge memorial, that was organized, that took place at Columbia University. And there were hundreds and hundreds of people standing room only. And then it ended. Mind you, it went from 7 pm to off to 1 am, was quite a memorial. Umm… And I took a cab home and for weeks no one called to see how I was doing. And if I let myself, it would have been easy to feel self-pity and how awful and… and I can't stand this. But I refused to let myself do it. Now I gotta tell you my profession helps me keep true to my principles, because I don't want to be a hypocrite. And if I'm not able to push my ass to practice what I preach, I would not be comfortable asking other people to do so. So, I do my best and so far successfully. And so it was pretty lonely in New York City for me at that time. I didn't have supportive friends. My husband was my focus in my life for those recent years. My beautiful loving mother in Australia, I didn't tell her that Al had died over the phone. I was going to tell when I visited her soon after in person. So I didn't have much support. So I live in a small New York City apartment. Pigeons come to my window. I started feeding them. Before long a few of them ate from my hand. So, I was in ache, I missed my husband. There was a lot of other difficult stuff going on. Then every day I saw my pigeons and that brought me joy. Not instead of the grief, despite and including the grief. And so we can make a choice. And so as therapists, if it's helpful to the client, let us share something, we have successfully done in a similar difficult situation to show them there is hope. And sometimes it's a reminder, a breath at a time, a step at a time. You can stand your heartache, keep going. Now what can we do this week? What can you do this week that might be helpful? With clients who come suffering from their grief it's helpful to you, as the therapist and to them, to clarify is this grief or is it actually depression? Is it healthy grief? You know, if you had told me at the time or bit after my husband died, my mother died, you know, come on you've been this sad for so many months. Can't you practice what you preach, get over it? I… I would umm… I would appreciate your intention. But not prevent myself from missing who I love. Doing so didn't prevent me from living a functional life. So I wasn't experiencing debilitating depression. It was grief. And that was helpful to me in some ways. It's kind of a… a reminder of the depth of my love and gratitude that that person was in my life. And so get clear if your client is coming to you with the grief issue. Well, is it grief or depression? And it may not be a clear cut, it maybe both. And help them clarify. And clarify the shoulds and the thinking and they shouldn't have died this way. And I should've been there more. And it's not fair that this. You know, and using REBT to lessen and ultimately change, remove depression. But appropriate sadness and grief about loss, that's part of the rich human potential to experience the tapestry, our feelings in life.

DEBBIE JOFFE ELLIS As I mentioned earlier and… and I'll repeat it in the context of… of the effective therapist because I… I feel it's been official to do so. There's been no time to go into great detail about what to specifically do using REBT with someone suffering from deep ongoing, indulgenous(ph) clinical depression, panic attacks that literally affect the breathing, umm… addiction, OCD, borderline conditions and other difficult conditions. But the principles that I've shared with you today and in the past two DVDs apply to these more extreme cases as well, just in all probability, longer term therapy will be of most benefit. Okay. I'd like to share an experience with you that my husband and I had in his final period of life. And then I will be delighted to answer any questions that you might have. So, I've indicated and you can read more about the difficulties that Al and I endured at the end of his life. And 15 months before he died, I think contributed to by the fatigue that he experienced as a result of doing his work of seeing therap… clients and… and supervising therapists and giving weekly workshops and trainings. In addition to that he was fighting for what he considered justice. And… And talking to… to lawyer and… and the fati… and he was 92. And then the fatigue of that and… and hiss already frail health contributed to him succumbing to pneumonia. And it was aspiration pneumonia. And so umm… rushed to ER one morning, morning after he gave a fantastic Friday night workshop. And so they had to put in a feeding tube because from that day on till he died, fifteen months later, no more food, no more water through mouth. His body literally became increasingly a torture chamber. And yet his mind was still great till a short time before his physical death. And so, he was mainly in hospital and then got better in rehab, hoping to get better and then there was a relapse in the hospital and… and then he'd get better and he… Even though he was suffering so much physically, he would still have students come and talk to them in the rehab facility and by his hospital bed. He still continued to push himself to do what was meaningful to him. So, a few months before he died, we were in the rehab place. I say, "We." I always slept wherever he was. It was in rehab, there was a recliner. If it was in the hospital, they kindly gave me a cot. So I was there around the clock with him and… and one morning his feeding tube came out, being diabetic he… his blood sugar was so low. He… He nearly fell into a diabetic coma. Rushed to ER and they pumped him with glucose. But there were other conditions and we were in ER for 38 hours. Because there wasn't a room for him available, now waiting to admit him. And he was very, very ill. Now a year before we had arranged for a group of Ph.D. psychology students from Belgium, to visit and to have him speak with them and answer their questions. he remembered this. Once he had the glucose and was more alert, he said, "We have to get back to the rehab. They're coming." And I said, "We… We can't. We can't." And so he said. "See if they can come here to the hospital." And… And the nurses and doctors are great. He looked extremely pale. I said, "Al, let's cancel. They'll understand." He said, "No." okay, so the group came in. He spoke to them about REBT. But very weak, same Al, humor, compassion, outrageousness. Questions to him. One person said, "Dr. Ellis, we're so honored to be here. Thank you. But Debbie told us how sick you are. Why didn't you cancel?" To which he responded, "In order to continue to teach the gospel, according to St. Albert." And they laughed and then he said in all sincerity, "In order to help each of you, to better understand the principles of REBT. Because when you do, and if you apply them in all probability, you'll have better lives. And in all probability, if you have better lives, you'll be able to help many more people more effectively, more of the time." And then he said, "So go work your asses off and do it." My husband was a rare man, a heart of gold, a genius mind. And what he contributed changed our fields, counseling psychology, society. He contributed to the sexual revolution. He fought for equal rights for women and for equal rights for gays in the 1940's before many people were willing to do so, in such a loud and public way. He contributed much. His approach of REBT when used with others, if they're willing to take action, can help them immeasurably to help themselves. And if each one of us, do the best that we can, to apply it, to our everyday lives, then in this one life we have that really can go so quickly. Those of you who are 25 or… or under, may think I have forever. It goes quickly. Gosh! I sound like an old woman here, but I'm not 25. Umm… Then if we're willing to live with those principles of REBT and all similar ones, then we will minimize our suffering. We'll be able to cherish what's good in our lives. And when we look, we can still find good in our lives if we're willing. So, I thank you for being here. I thank you for being there. Thank you to all who made these DVDs possible. And I wish each and every one of you a most inwardly, tranquil outwardly enjoyable life with the willingness to use your resilience to carry you through the toughest of times as well.
