Miville, Ph.D. Winter Roundtable Director 

00:00:35
MARIE L. MIVILLE Dr. Isaac Prilleltensky was born in Argentina and has lived and worked in Israel, Canada, Australia and United States. He currently is dean in a much warmer climate than we are here, uhm, he's the Dean of Education and Human Development at the University of Miami, my hometown and the inaugural Erwin and Barbara Mautner Chair in Community Well -Being. He has published seven books and over 125 articles and chapters. And his interest are in the promotion of well-being of individuals, organizations and communities and in the integration of wellness and fairness. He is the recipient of the 2011 Distinguished Contribution to Theory and Research Award of the community psychology division of APA. So, on a more personal note Isaac is a vegan and fitness aficionado and my favorite thing a humor writer. His humor columns had been published in the Miami Herald and Miami Today and you can find his, his writings on his blog called Going Wellnuts, ah, at and there's a-- there's a, a link on the brochure. And so, I just want to give you a little bit of a sense of his, ah, humor. So here is something he recently wrote online. "I have a confession to make. I'm a community psychologist but I don't like people very much. I like the idea of people, but actual people are something else: They smell, they talk too much, they don't know to spell and they sometimes wearing Nike shirts with Adidas shorts." Now Dr. Prilleltensky is, uhm, identifies as a Jewish-Latino male and so his own personal life, his own personal life trajectory has actually been effected by violence as well but he takes this amazing humorous approach about that so let me just read that. "My ancestors were very lucky; they escaped pogrom-- a pogroms and the Cossacks in Kishinev to move to Argentina, which later became a haven for Nazis and a fascist dictator. Now, don't get me wrong, Cossacks, Nazis, and Fascists had great sense of community, but they had a very bad sense of humor, and a very bad genocidal streak; two things that we Jews don't really like." So he goes on to talk about the importance of community interventions still teasingly humorously, ah, something called communophilicon if I got that right has aided in his own personal recovery and so he writes, "You would have thought that all these multigenerational traumatic experiences would have made me into an antisocial, paranoid lunatic. Wrong. These experen-- experiences made me into a rabid antisocial, paranoid lunatic. But I want you to know that I'm in remission. Deciding to take this communophilicon by injection, in the eye, four times a day. I'm telling you, I'm a completely new person. Now among other things I'm raising funds to rehabilitate homeless Nazis in Argentina, I'm creating a prison visiting program for former dictators. It feels great to help the community." And so, Dr. Prilleltensky.

00:03:55
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Okay, so the secret is out. I am a humor writer and so I, I know that it creates all kinds of expectations but my presentation will be really boring, okay? So please don't put so much pressure on me. So, uhm, thank you very much for the introduction. I'm, I'm very pleased to be here, uhm, I have a sense of affinity with the Teachers College, my daughter-in-law graduated a couple of years ago from Teachers College. She's now a teacher here in New York city, the head of an English department that NEST+m in the lower side. My son graduated from Bank Street College and he's a teacher chess and he teaches chess in the same school. His team have won national competitions so they're both here, both teachers and I feel I say it's a great sense of affinity with the four pillars of Teachers College which are psychology, health, education and leadership and at our own school at the University of Miami our vision is to promote an integrate psychological, physical and educational well-being in multicultural communities which sounds similar to many of the things that you do and our mission is to courier the next generation of leaders in agents of change in education and the community. So I feel a great sense of kinship with what's happening here at the Teachers College. So thank you for inviting me. Ah, I'd like to talk about how to promote peace. Uhm, in recent report by the World Health Organization indicates that every year there are about half a million people killed through homicides a half a million people. In a few years that would extinguished the Manhattan, okay. Now, ah, a lot of us have known people, ah, who have experience in physical, psychological, sexual violence. Uhm, my own sister was a political prisoner in Argentina in the 70s when we were all fighting the dictatorship. She experienced torture and sexual violence and, and I'm sure here around the room all of us know somebody who has had the traumatic violent experiences. Now, my approach to well-being is preventive. 

00:06:35
Outline 1. Mattering 2. Wellness 3. Fairness 4. Change 

00:06:35
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY So instead of talking about the curing violence I'd like to talk this morning about how to promote peace, ah, and I would like to talk about three pillars of peace which I called mattering, wellness and fairness and we heard about black lives matter, all lives matter. I would like to expand a little bit on the notion of mattering and then talk about the relationship between mattering, wellness and fairness and then I'm going to talk about the paradigms and skills for change, okay? So these are the four topics that we're going to be covering. 

00:07:15
Mattering Recognition and Impact 

00:07:20
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY So let's start with mattering. And in my mind, mattering is about recognition and impact. All of us yearn, crave have a human need to feel recognized, affirmed, appreciated for who we are regardless of our skin, abilities, say languages. We all deserved to be recognized that's one side of the equation of mattering but we also require a sense of self-efficacy, impact. We want to change the world. We want to be agents of change. 

00:08:00
Recognition entitlement - invisibility Mattering domination - helplessness Impact 

00:08:00
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY So what you see is, ah, the two pillars of mattering recognition and impact. And recognition can be distorted and when recognition is distorted some problems begin. Ah, on one end of the continuum there are some individuals who experience invisibility. Many people in society experience a sense of lack of recognition. They go about their business feeling invisible to others because they have a bis-- ah, they a disability because they don't speak the language well. I am a professional immigrant. I moved countries four times and every time I had to move to a new country I had to learn a new language, ah, except when I moved to Australia that's, that's a new language too. Uhm, so you have a sense that people don't really recognize who you are. Now, so you're invisible. At the other end of the continuum a distortion to our primal sense of recognition is a huge sense of entitlement, right? We can go from one con-- end of the continuum people who feel invisible by society and at the other end of the continuum we'll have individuals who feel completely entitled and both extremes are unhealthy. Now, what happens at the other end of the conti-- at the other element of mattering? We have impact. Now, ah, at one end of this continuum we have people who experience helplessness. Ah, for a variety of reasons they have not had life opportunities to practice mattering self-efficacy to feel like agents of change, to feel capable so they experience helplessness which is very unhealthy and at the other end of the continuum we have individuals who experience a great need for control and domination and neither e-- extreme is healthy. 

00:10:10
Lack of Mattering and Aggression 

00:10:10
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY So we now not only from human studies that mattering is crucial to well-being but we also notice from animal studies. So what I'm going to show you now is the relationship between, between lack of mattering, lack of fairness and aggression in a couple of Capuchin monkeys. This will be introduce by Frans de Waal who is a frame-- primatologist at Emory University. 

00:10:40
Frans de Waal (2015) Capuchins reject unequal pay 

00:10:45
FRANS DE WAAL So final experiment that I wanna mention to you is our fairness study. Ah, and so this the-- this became a very famous study and there's now many more because after we did this about 10 years, ah, it became very well-known. And we did that originally with Capuchins monkeys and I'm gonna show you the first experiment that we did. It has now been done with dogs and with birds and with chimpanzees, uhm, but the (inaudible ) we started out was Capuchin monkeys. So what we did is we put two Capuchins monkeys side by side. Again, these animals they live in a group. They know each other. We take them out of the group, put them in a test chamber and there's a very simple task that they need to do and if you give both of them cucumber for the task the two monkeys side by side they are perfectly willing to do this 25 times in a row. So cucumber even though it's really only water in my opinion but cucumber is perfectly fine for them. Now, if you give (inaudible ) grapes the, the food preferences of my Capuchin monkeys correspond exactly with the prices in the supermarket. And so, if we give them grapes is a far better food, ah, then you'll create an equity between them. So that's the experiment we did. Recently, we videotaped these monkeys we never done the task and thinking that maybe that we have a stronger reaction and that turn out to be right. The one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber, the one on the right is the one who gets grapes. The one who gets cucumber note that the first piece of cucumber is perfectly fine. The first piece he eats, ah, then she sees the other one getting grape and you will see what happens. So she gives a rock to us that's the task and we give her a piece of cucumber and she eats it. The other one needs to give a rock to us and that's what she does. And she gets a grape and the eats it. The other sees that so she gives a rock to us now gets again cucumber. 

00:12:40
[sil.] 

00:12:55
FRANS DE WAAL She test the rock now against the wall she needs to give it to us and she gets cucumber again. 

00:13:05
[sil.] 

00:13:10
FRANS DE WAAL So this is basically de Waal street protest that you see here. 

00:13:20
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY So this is a no joke, you know, uhm, what, what, what did we see lack of fairness. They both give a rock. One gets a grape, the other one gets a cucumber and you react violently and this is a paradigm for understanding some of the relationship between fairness and aggression. So I want us to keep that in mind as we move forward, okay? 

00:13:45
Wellness Multiple Domains Multiple Connections 

00:13:45
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY So now I would like to say if a few words about wellness and the first thing I'd like to say is that wellness consist of multiple domains that interact with each other and base on in extensive review of the literature in some of our own studies, ah, we came to the conclusion that the well-being or wellness consist of six primary domains which form the acronym I COPPE so they stand for interpersonal, community, occupational, physical, psychological and economic well-being and we will see that when we uphold these six domains of well-being we have a better chance of promoting peace and harmony in society. 

00:14:35
Wellness: I COPPE Domains of life Interpersonal well-being Community well-being Occupational well-being Physical well-being Psychological well-being Economic well-being Correlation among I COPPE domains, overall well-being, and comparison measures (Prilleltensky et al., Journal of Community Psychology 2015) 

00:14:40
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY And so, ah, we recently published the study where we validated an instrument, ah, to assess multidimensional well-being and what we did was we correlated individual domains of well-being the I COPPE domains of well-being with overall well-being and you can see the significant correlations here between the different domains of well-being and overall well-being and these are the correlations between, ah, where existing measure and well established comparison measures in the literature. And so, I'll just say a few words about each one of these domains about interpersonal, community, occupational, et cetera. I'm gonna say a few words about the key challenges in each domain and what have we learned, ah, from research about each one of them. 

00:15:30
Interpersonal well-being: Challenges 1. How to resolve conflict 2. How to foster positive relationships Interpersonal well-being: Benefits • Less likely to have heart attacks • More likely to resist common cold virus • Lower mortality • Less degree of stress • More positive outlook on life • Resilience • Recover faster from wounds • Odds of being happy go up if a direct connection in your social network is happy 

00:15:30
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY So to promote peace interpersonally we need to know how to resolve conflict then how to foster positive relationships. Ah, there are many benefits to establishing harmonious, peaceful relationships, people who experience a social support are less likely to have heart attacks, more likely to resist the common cold virus. They have lower mortality rates, less degree of stress. In other words, interpersonal well-being is crucial to psychological and physical well-being. 

00:16:05
Interpersonal Well-Being: Enemies: bad company • 61% more likely to smoke if you have a direct connection with someone who smokes • if your friend becomes obese, your chances of becoming obese increase by 57% • if your friend is violent, you are likely to behave in violent ways as well 

00:16:05
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Now we know for example that 61% of people are more likely to smoke if they have a direct connection with someone who smokes. Uhm, and we also know that if your friend is violent you're likely to behave in violent ways as well and we also know from the literature that the role modeling is one of the, uhm, most effective ways to teach violent or non-violent, ah, behaviors. 

00:16:35
Interpersonal wellbeing: Enemy Poor Listening • "Your problem is that you can't say no" (Diagnosing) • "Don't worry about it, I am sure it'll be fine" (Reassuring) • "This is exactly what happened to me..." (Diverting) • "This is what you should tell her..." (Giving advise) 

00:16:35
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Now poor listening is an enemy of well-being. Ah, we often engage in diagnosing people, falsely reassuring them, diverting conversations, giving advise instead of truly, genuinely and authentically listening to people. So this is a source of, uhm, miscommunication that leads to alienation in relationships. 

00:17:00
Community well-being: 1. How to help individuals 2. How to build a better community 

00:17:00
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Now what about community well-being? In order to have harmonious peaceful communities we need to learn how to help individuals and how to build a better community. 

00:17:10
Community Well-Being: Benefits • Contributing to communities builds social capital • Emotional boost in helping • Helper therapy principle • Social norms: Gary Slutkin's Cure Violence Project • AA and WW help with accountability and positive peer pressure • Weight pressure alone: 24% chance of maintaining gains after 10 months • With group support of strangers, 50% chance • With group support friends, 66% chance 

00:17:15
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Contributing to communities builds a social capital. When we volunteer, when we participate in civic affairs, when we, ah, attend marches and demonstrations and vote, ah, we are contributing not just to our own well-being or the well-being of our own community but also, ah, to civic society as I will demonstrate in a minute. We also know that helping other people is good for the helpers, right? This is the emotional boost that we get in helping. This is the helper therapy principle and there has been a lot of work done by Gary Slutkin on the project that to cure the violence and basically what they do, they work on social norms so they intervene in communities where in a violent, ah, incident has taken place and they deploy a lot of community members who are trying to prevent the escalation of violence and Gary Slutkin's project has gone international and has received a great deal of attention for its effectiveness in preventing violence through the institution of new social norms. Now, we also know that when you're trying to change a behavior, when you're trying to improve if you do this thing in a group, ah, you'll have a higher chance of success than if you do this by yourself. So for example, alcoholic synonyms and weight watchers are more effective in improving these two conditions than individuals who try to do this by themselves and the best results are obtained when you're trying to change along with people who are you friends or relatives. 

00:18:55
Social capital and community well-being: Benefits and enemies 

00:19:00
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Now, social capital and community well-being are very closely related. Social capital refers to the extent, ah, in which you participating your community, the thickness of networks. If you are connected to many events, communities, faith-based organizations, civic enterprise the social capital of the community is said to increase. As you can see from this graph different, ah, states around the country have different levels of social capital. This was documented over many years by Robert Putnam in his book Bowling Alone. You have heard of that book. It was published in I think 2001 and when I was a professor at Vanderbilt University and I used to show this to my students in Tennessee that used to get offended because they used to say that in the south we're all very friendly, uhm, and they, they didn't recognize-- so there are two types of social capital. So you could put here you know, Tennessee goes here a lot of seven states don't experience a lot of social capital and as a consequences they have lower levels of health, welfare, education, tolerance and crime. They have-- sorry, they have high levels of crime, right. So there are two types of social capital. One is bonding. Bonding is when you hang out with people like you, okay? Bonding is when you make an effort to congregate with people with similar backgrounds. This is a lot of what goes on in the south. What they don't have a lot of is bridging social capital. Bridging is when you extend a hand to communicate relate and commune with people from other backgrounds, right? So in the south there is a lot of bonding capital people are very friendly to people like themselves but they are not very friendly to people from other background. So as a friend of mine used to say Nashville, Nashville is a city that makes you feel more welcome than you're really are. Uhm, so there are many things that can be achieved in communities so I'd like to show you now, ah, the benefits of working in communities to achieve physical well-being. 

00:21:35
Building Community HARACLIP.NET Contrex Vivez l'expériene sur facebook Occupational well-being: Challenges 1. How to be organized 2. How to feel engaged and use your strengths 

00:23:05
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Okay, you can't have that much fun if you'll do this by yourself, right? Ah, so communities help you know, to, to generate enthusiasm for certain causes in this case physical well-being. Ah, let me say a word about occupational well-being. Occupational well-being is about how to be organized, how to feel engaged and use your strengths. 

00:23:25
Occupational Well-Being: Benefits • Men who lived to 95 did not retire until they were 80 years old • As engagement increases, cholesterol and triglycerides go down • If your manager focuses on your strengths, the chances of your being disengaged is just 1% 

00:23:25
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY And we know from studies that the men who lived to 95 they did not retire until they were in their 80s, okay? That's because work doesn't have to be the only, ah, occupation that provides meaning and engagement but it often ease, right? So as engagement increases in any activity it doesn't have to be paid employment it can be volunteered, it can be stay at home parents, ah, for as long as you were engage your, uhm, cholesterol and triglycerides go down which is a good thing and we also know in relationships at work that if your manager focuses on your strengths, the chances of your being disengaged is just 1%. 

00:24:10
Occupational Well-Being: Enemies • Unemployment leads to disease and depression • Disengagement also lead to disease and depression • Your boss can be the best doctor or the worst killer • Worst manager is the one who does not pay attention 

00:24:15
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Now we also confirmed this in some of, ah, of our own studies exploring the impact of occupational well-being on overall health and well-being and we found that unemployment is a very bad, ah, condition because it leads to disease and depression, ah, disengagement is, ah, originates a very negative chained reaction. Now, we also know that relationships at work are very important it is often said that your boss can be the best doctor or the worst killer. Ah, in many studies people report that the greatest sources of stress at work is the relationship they have with their boss at the same time if the boss is kind, engaging, compassionate, affirming your well-being, ah, goes up. 

00:25:05
Sir Michael Marmot and control over your file Risk of Death by Employment and Level of Control: 29,000 people, 30 years 

00:25:05
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Now, ah, to demonstrate the impact of, ah, lack of control in occupational well-being we turn to Michael Marmot. Michael Marmot is a British epidemiologist who's studied the health and well-being of about 30,000 British civil servants and what he studied was the risk of premature death of different, uhm, occupational groups and what Michael Marmot found was that administrators have about half the risk of premature mortality as compared to professionals, ah, who have in turn lower risk than clerical staff and lower, ah, much lower risk than unskilled labor. This is what Michael Marmot calls the social gradient and what he discovered was that after controlling for physical activities smoking, eating patterns et cetera the key variable that predicted longevity was a sense of control at work. So when we talk about the empowering people and giving people a sense of control over their lives it's no idle talk, right, people who experience higher sense of control over their lives are going to live longer. In the 60s and 70s they're used to be a theory that if you are the boss you have so much stress and, and you'll worry a lot. Well, ah, what happens is that if you are the boss you also have a great deal of control and autonomy and self-determination which many people who work in the organization do not have so I want you to remember this graph in the-- that-- the importance of control. 

00:26:55
Physical well-being: Challenges 1. How to improve nutrition 2. How to improve physical activity Physical Well-Being: Benefits • We can control expression of genes (prostate cancer suppressed by eating broccoli) • Omega 3 is good for your brain • Sugars and carbohydrates tell our brains to eat more, but • Nuts, avocados, and olive oil tell our brains to stop eating because we are satisfied • Eat red, green and blue 

00:27:00
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Now, what about physical well-being? We all know that we need to improve nutrition and we need to improve, ah, our physical activity. No we, we know there is a lot of things we can do to promote a physical well-being even to suppressed the expression of some by the genes and so for example prostate can be suppressed by eating a lot of broccoli. I don't know whether I have a prostate gene in my but I should eat a lot of broccoli and we also know a great deal about omega 3, we know what we should eat, we know what we shouldn't eat but people done to do that. Uhm, so we are engage at the University of Miami in a project to promote health and well-being. 

00:27:40
Physical Well-Being: Enemy: Food industry • We are very bad at resisting temptation in menus • Food industry creates addictions • www.funforwellness.com • www.wellnuts.org 

00:27:40
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY I'll show you a little bit of the skills we try, uhm, ah, teach later on but the bottom line is that we are very bad at resisting temptation, okay? Ah, we are very weak as a species and so we are developing mobile app in, in online intervention to promote health and well-being and if you wanna teach your children how to eat better I invite you to go wellnuts.org you can download some of our applications for free. We have a galactic food fight here-- there. 

00:28:15
Physical Well-Being: Enemy: Lack of Prevention • Economic of ill health - 50% of all healthcare spending is consumed by just 5% of the population - 75% of medical costs are due to preventable conditions such stress, tobacco, inactivity and poor food choices 

00:28:15
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Uhm, now we also know that the healthcare is a big, ah, problem in all countries and we also know that 75% of all the medical cost they are due to preventable conditions such as stress, tobacco, inactivity and poor food choices. 

00:28:35
Enemy: The Doctor?? Just what the doctor recommended 

00:28:35
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Uhm, we also know that doctors don't always help in some, ah, about 40 years ago doctors used to recommend cigarettes, ah, more doctors smoke camels than any other cigarettes and they are all kind of weird theories that smoking relaxes you et cetera. 

00:28:55
Psychological well-being: Challenges 1. How to cope with stress 2. How to foster positive emotions and meaning in life 

00:28:55
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY What about psychological well-being? We need to foster positive emotions and meaning in life and we need to cope with stress. Uhm, and as I said before a sense of control is part of making an impact, sense of control of part of mattering. We need to feel that we are effective human beings. We need to derive meaning from serious engagement with a task. 

00:29:25
Psychological Well-Being Sense of control Efficacy Meaning 

00:29:25
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY So here, ah, you see my son, Matan Prilleltensky, the chess teacher. This is in Harvard Square. He was playing the master. This is the guy who charges you $2 to kick your butt, okay? So people play $2 and they play chess and after pretty much 20 seconds the game is over, ah, that was until he met my son. Ah, so, ah, my son he knows how to play a chess very well and these guys are very poor loser. Uhm, and, and the reason I show this is not just to show the connection between losing and being aggressive which this gentlemen exhibited, uhm, but I also show to you this, ah, picture because my son now the, the chess, a champion have an incredible, unbelievable ADD condition when he was growing up and I know it because I was a school psychologist and so was my wife. And we work at a child guidance clinic at that time. So Matan didn't do that great in school because he was very disorganized, ah, but he was very bright. So chess was an outlet for him and it-- his story really reminds us of the importance of compensation, right? And so school wasn't going that great. He was kind of disorganized all over the place but he found an outlet for all his strengths in chess and this is a prototypical strength based, ah, approach, right? He devoted a lot of his easy years, he developed a career out of something that was his passion. He felt engage, a sense of self-efficacy. 

00:31:15
Happiness and Well-Being: Benefits • Happier people are ... - More sociable and energetic - More cooperative and charitable - Better liked by others - More flexible in thinking - More productive - More resilient - Better leaders - Physically healthier - Live longer 

00:31:15
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY We also know that happier people are more sociable, energetic. They cooperate better with others, they are resilient, they are better leaders. 

00:31:25
Psychological Well-Being: Enemies • Poor self-esteem • Helplessness • Low self-efficacy • Poor impulse control • Negative self-talk • Mental health issues • Put downs • Scorn • Envy • Bullying • Emotional abuse • Neglect 

00:31:25
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY And we also know that there are enemies to psychological well-being like helplessness, negative self-talk and of course bullying. Bullying is, ah, noxious condition in the environment put down, scorn, envy, bullying, emotional abuse, neglect. These are preconditions for a lifelong course of problems. Ah, Susan Fiske, the psychologist at the Princeton University a couple of years, ah, published the fascinating book I recommend it's called Envy Up, Scorn Down. Basically the social psychological mechanisms that create divisions among people. 

00:32:05
Economic well-being: Challenges 1. How to manage money better 2. How to improve long term financial security 

00:32:05
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Ah, finally to say a word or two about economic well-being, ah, all of us need to improve our long-term security. 

00:32:15
Economic Well-Being: Benefits • Well being tied to GDP • Richer countries report higher levels of well-being • Money essential for basic needs • However, money is not everything! • Spending money on yourself is not as good as spending money on others • We spend the most when we are sad • If you spend, buy experiences, not things 

00:32:15
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY We know that well-being is tight to GDP. We know that richer countries report levels-- higher levels of well-being because of material conditions but we also know that money is not everything. After a certain threshold what we know is that investing more in having two or three jobs to make more money after a certain level is not going to make, ah, a big difference. We also now incidentally that spending money on yourself is not as good a s spending money on others. Ah, the boost that you get in your happiness in subjective well-being is higher when you buy a gift to somebody else than when you spend money on your own. Ah, we also know that if you do have a little extra money the best thing you can do is by experiences as oppose to buying objects. That was well-being interpersonal community, occupational, physical, psychological and economic well-being. The more well-being we experience psychologically, interpersonally in the community the higher the chances that we-- will experience peaceful harmonious relationships. 

00:33:15
Fairness Multiple Domains Multiple Connections Wellness as Fairness Intrapersonal Justice Economic Physical Health Psychological Occupational Community Interpersonal Personal Well-being 

00:33:20
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY What about fairness? Fairness like wellness has multiple domains and multiple connections among themselves. So what I want to show you here are different levels of justice in an ecological, ah, way. I'd like to demonstrate that different aspects of justice impact interpersonal community, occupational, psychological, physical and economic well-being in different ways. I know that the concept of interpersonal injustice or justice is counterintuitive and nobody would say that we are unfair to ourselves but I want to postulate the notion that's on people who engage in self-injurious behaviors do indeed experience a case of interpersonal injustice. Now, ah, when we talk about the interpersonal justice there are two main types of justice what we call distributive and procedural. Distributive justice is about allocating resources, pains and gains basically distributing goods and obligations in society in a fair way. This is about the what, what am I distributing? Am I giving scholarships in a fair way? Am I giving healthcare to everybody, right? These are distributional questions but we also have procedural questions of justice. This is the what of justice. This is the how of justice and they-- the how of justice is experience when you either participate or you were never ask your opinion about what happens in your life or in the relationship, okay? So interpersonal justice procedural justice. Procedural is about participating, participating in decisions affecting your life. These are two types of justices that are prevalent in relationships. There are also developmental injustice you can think of child abuse or elder abuse, you can think of relational injustice when one party makes all the decisions takes all the goodies in the relationship and you don't have a chance to participate in deciding what happens. Your children don't participate in decisions, your spouses doesn't participate in decisions you are the only one making the decisions. Organizational justice we also experience distributive and procedural justice who gets paid how much. Are we paying minimal wage to people? Are we recognizing their efforts? Do people have a say at work? Ah, related to procedural justice is informational justice. In the literature the issue of transparency comes up again and again often because you feel infantilize when decisions are made in your workplace and you are not consulted. When stuff happens and you don't know why and you are just informed, okay? Now, we related what happens here the level of distributive, procedural, relational, informational and developmental justice is going to have an impact on well-being because the more procedural justice we have, the more support participation and celebration of human being take place in the organization the more the distributive justice there is, there is-- the more equity and respect in the organization we function better when there is interpersonal developmental and informational justice, we have a sense of control and there is a better help. So do you see what happens at the bottom of the sphere? It has a huge impact on what happens at the top of the sphere. The same happens at the community level. Here we include also cultural justice. The way discriminate people on the basis of their cultural background, their racial identity, their linguistic background and similarly do people who transgress, do they pay a price? Do we live in countries, in communities where there is a lot of retributive justice or there isn't? I grew up in Argentina. In Argentina you literally can get away with murder. Only a few weeks ago they killed a prosecutor who was investigating a terrorist attack because of the fear that he might expose the president, okay? The case is not completely, uhm, close yet but there is a great deal of suspicion that he was killed because of what he knew. So in Argentina you can do a lot of things and get away with murder. In some of the-- some communities in this country happens the same. So, when there is no retributive justice, where there is no cultural justice, when there is no procedural justice, when we-- when decisions are made and you do not participate when people are discriminated because they are Black, Hispanics or because they have a disability. When people do not get health insurance for no reason other than they couldn't get a job in this country, these are cases of injustice and the more injustice there is, there is the less well- being the rest. 

00:38:40
Health and Social Problems are Worse in More Unequal Countries Index at: • Life expectancy • Meth & Urinary • Infant mortality • Homicides • Imprisonment • Teenage births • Trust • Obesity • Metal illness - drug & alcohol addiction • Social mobility 

00:38:40
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY So let me just show you the case of economic and equality which is the case of distributive injustice. What we have here are countries with different levels of inequality going from low to high and what we have here is an index of health and social problems consisting of these variables, life expectancy, homicides, imprisonment, mental illness, social mobility. And what you see is that countries where there is low levels of inequality you end up with far fewer psychological and social problems including a reduce level of violence. Now, what happens is that the higher you go on levels of inequality the more problems there are in society. So what I should you here is that a few years ago I was living in Canada and well-being was sort of okay. Then, I move to Australia and started to deteriorate and I move to the U.S. and I'm at high risk of dying soon. 

00:39:45
Levels of Trust are Higher in More Equal US State 

00:39:50
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Uhm, now the same can be said for level trust. Ah, levels of trust are higher in more equal US states, okay? So we have these are states like Minnesota and Vermont where there is lower levels of inequality, higher levels of trust and this is New York city and Alabama where there is more inequality low levels of trust. 

00:40:15
Levels of Trust are Higher in More Equal Rich Countries 

00:40:15
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY The same happens across countries not just the states within the U.S. 

00:40:20
Wellness as Fairness 

00:40:20
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY So now let me try to bring this together and connect wellness with fairness. So wellness exist wellness or well-being exist a different levels, different systems I experience individual well-being relational, organizational, communal all the way to environmental well-being because the environment also experiences well-being or lack their off. We can measure these levels of well-being with objective elements. We can measure health and illness, the number of networks in which I participate isolation resources, social capital, pollution et cetera. We call them objective elements but we also measure well-being through subjective elements efficacy, lack of control, voice, repression, et cetera. And what happens is that for a society in order to improve objective and subjective elements we need to spouse a series of values like autonomy, caring, participation, compassion, respect for diversity and the protection of human ri-- and environmental resources. All these values and the distribution of them is a matter of fairness. How do we balance what's to me as an individual with what's do the environment on my relationships. So in essence what happens at the level of fairness is going to have a huge impact at the level of wellness at the higher levels in objective and subjective measures. 

00:41:55
Wellness Continuum Psychological Processes Fairness Continuum Thriving • Promotion of Responsive Conditions • Prevention • Individual Pursuit • Avoidance of Comparisons Optimal Conditions of Justice Coping • Resilience • Adaptation • Compensation • Downward Comparison Suboptimal Conditions of Justice Confronting • Critical Experience • Critical Consciousness • Critical Action • Righteous Comparison Vulnerable Conditions of Injustice Suffering • Oppression • Internalization • Helplessness • Upward Comparison Persisting Conditions of Injustice 

00:42:00
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY And so, I believe that the more justice there is in a community, the more wellness there is in a community. So if we can imagine for a second societies with optimal conditions of justice, optimal conditions of justice they lead to the promotion of responsive conditions, they promote the individual pursuit of every varying society and they avoid comparisons. If you live in this conditions you're likely to thrive. But if you live in suboptimal conditions of justice you are going to spend a lot of time fighting in justice and trying to compensate. You are going to have to adapt which is not a bad thing but you may reach levels of coping instead of thriving. Now, when you, when you live under conditions of injustice you begin to experience critical experiences, critical consciousness, critical action so some societies in different times in their history and just societies experience vulnerabilities. You can think about the Arab Spring a few years ago, right? These are historical times when people say we're not going to take it anymore. You can think about the civil rights movement, you can think about ADA the disability rights movement, you can think about the women's movement. So there are certain times where historical events congeal and we are saying we are not going to take this anymore and we believe in what I'm calling righteous comparisons because if people in that community can have access to good schools I want the same thing for my kids. This is a righteous comparison. Now, unfortunately some people live in persisting conditions of injustice in which they have to struggle with helplessness or pressure internalization and what we need to do as psychologist, educators and health professionals is to move our communities from these end to this end. This is a critical moment that some communities say are experiencing now in the U.S. with the unfortunate killings of Black youth and there is a moment, there is an opportunity to build on that.

BET I CAN Strategies for Change 

00:44:25
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Now, let me say a few words about strategies for change and of course I would like to talk about skills because if you want to be an effective agent of change this doesn't happen by default. It's not just a matter of good intentions. We can have good intentions help to change the society but good intentions need to be accompanied by strong skills. 

00:44:50
BET I CAN: Seven scientific principles to promote well-being BET I CAN Behaviors SET A GOAL CREATE POSITIVE HABITS Emotions CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS COLLECT POSITIVE EMOTIONS Thoughts CHALLENGE ASSUMPTIONS WRITE A NEW STORY Interactions EXPRESS YOURSELF EMPATHIZE Context Awareness Next Steps 

00:44:50
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY So what we use in our intervention that we are promoting are seven skills drivers of change which are summarize in the acronym BET I CAN. So you are familiar with the transtheoretical approach to change in well-being by Prochaska & DiClemente so this, this is a similar approach we call them drivers of change and to promote change and well-being there are seven scientific principles. The first one is behaviors. We need to do something. To, to achieve good social goals we need to set a goal and create positive habits around achieving a goal. If I want to become healthier I don't just think I will eat better, sleep better and stops smoking I have to set a goal and there is a science of goal setting and there is a science for creating positive habits. The same happens with social justice. It's not enough for me to wish society was better I have to get into the habit of voting, I have to get into the habit of participating in civic affairs I have to get active in political causes so this take habits. They don't happen by default. What happens with, ah, emotions? Well we all experience negative emotions especially if you're part of a social movement you can burn out easily and we got to have scientific strategies to cope with the negative emotions and collect positive emotions along the way. One of the ways I use is humor that's my way of collecting positive emotions. I, I write humor. This is my way of buttressing my emotional well-being. We have to challenge negative assumptions about themselves and we have to write a new narrative. We have to teach people how to write a new narrative that the fact that they were victimized in the past doesn't necessarily determining their future. We have to be able to co-construct with other people a new story about themselves. We have to connect with others and communicate and we have to be appreciative of the context in which we live because context tend to normalize really pathologies. We rescuing the environment, we have to be able to call on injustices and we have to be able to change the cues. This happens, you know, just for fairness for wellness but also for fairness. If you think that you want to become healthier what we need to do is not just to change our thoughts but to change their environment. So let me show you quickly the impact of an environmental change on health and well-being. 

00:47:45
Context is important for wellness Can we get more people to choose the stairs by making it fun to do? Odenplan, Stockholm 66% more people has named chose the stairs over the escalator. Fun run obviously change behavior for the better. We call it the fun theory. 

00:47:45
BET I CAN Context READ THE CUES CHANGE THE CUES Awareness KNOW YOURSELF KNOW THE ISSUE Next Steps MAKE A PLAN MAKE IT STICK 

00:49:25
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Okay. So I think we undermine the importance of context. We think that if we are strong psychologically that if we have enough willpower we can overcome temptations in the environment that we can just change and that is not true. We need to change the environment. The environment has to be inviting to engage in health behaviors in wellness behaviors, in fairness behaviors. Now we also need to understand ourselves, understand the issues that we're dealing with and we need to make a plan and we need to make it stick. So my message here is that good intentions are not enough that we have a great deal of psychological knowledge on what we lead to successful changes in your personal wellness, you community wellness and fairness. 

00:50:15
SPEC Paradigms for Change Paradigms for Wellness and Fairness from DRAIN • Deficits • Reactive • Arrogance • Individual blame To SPEC • Strengths • Prevention • Empowerment • Community Change 

00:50:15
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY So lastly, I just want to put this in the context of paradigms for change. And so, there are four main cardinal sins that a lot of us helping professional often engaging. The helping professions have suffer from four key problems. They have been deficit-oriented, reactive, they have been quite arrogant in telling people how to live their lives and we have been engaging in individual blaming. And I submit that we need to move from the drain approach to what I call the SPEC approach which is based on strengths, prevention, empowerment and community change. 

00:50:55
Contextual Field: Temporal and Ecological Dimensions Collective Quadrant IV Examples: Food banks, shelters for homeless people, charities, prison industrial complex Reactive Quadrant III Examples: Crisis work, therapy, medications, symptom containment, case management THIS IS WHERE WE ARE Individual THIS IS WHERE WE NEED TO BE Quadrant I Examples: Community development, affordable housing policy, recreational opportunities, high-quality schools and health services Proactive Quadrant II Examples: Skill building, emotional literacy, fitness programs, personal improvement plans, resistance to peer pressure in drug and alcohol use 

00:50:55
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY And when you put this for dimensions to access what you have is from reactive to proactive you have a serious social therapeutic community interventions and you have interventions that go from the individual to the collective. And when you look at the investment society makes on trying to improve well-being across temporal and ecological dimensions we invest more of our money here crisis work, therapy, medication, symptom containment case management. We treat a lot psychosocial problems related to lack of fairness and inequality as if they were intrapsychic problems and we need to invest more here. This is important to do but this is even more important because we need to create the conditions in society that we lead to fewer cases requiring help here, right? We also need to build more on proactive, skill building, emotional literacy fitness programs and something that we do terribly in society is instead of dealing with social problems proactively at the collective level we create more food, banks, more shelters, more prisons. In Florida they predict how many prisons they are going to need based on the failure rate of children in grade three. So Florida start investing more money in building new prisons than in education. 

00:52:30
Affirmation field: Participation and capabilities Strengths Quadrant IV Examples: Just say no! You can do it! Cheerleading approaches, Make nice approaches Detachment Quadrant III Examples: Labeling and diagnosis, "patienthood" and clienthood", citizens in passive role THIS IS WHERE WE ARE Deficits THIS IS WHERE WE NEED TO BE Quadrant I Examples: Voice and choice in celebrating and building competences, recognition of personal and collective resilience Empowerment Quadrant II Examples: Voice and choice in deficit-reduction approaches, participation in decisions on how to treat affective disorders or physical disorders 

00:52:35
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY When you put the two elements of participation and capabilities across the axis you have interventions that are deficit-oriented, some they are strength-oriented, some they are empowering and some there are based on detachment. So you see that there is a lot of go-- a lot of this going on in society. This is the quadrant of deficit and alienation, right? What we need to do more is investing voice and chose in celebrating and building competencies recognition of personal and collective resilience and we have to give people voice and choice in programs to reduce some of their challenges. This is Nancy Reagan approach to health and well-being. Remember Nancy Reagan used to say, just say no to drugs, you know, then Bush used to say, just say no to sex. And both approaches failed, right? Because it's a cheerleading approach just if you think nice thoughts the problem will go away and nothing could be further from the truth. 

00:53:40
Strengths 

00:53:40
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY So let me wrap up by giving you a few exemplars of strength-based approaches. So this is Muhammad Yunus. Muhammad Yunus received the Nobel Prize for his work promoting community development in Bangladesh. I knew peripherally of Bangla-- of Bangladesh and the work he did there because he is a Vanderbilt alum where I used to work and Muhammad Yunus returns often to Vanderbilt to tell the story to the students and the professors. He came back to Bangladesh with a degree in economics and he realized that he needed to understand deeply why there is so much poverty in Bangladesh and so he started talking to people in Bangladesh is a rural economy mainly and people used to tell him that, we are very poor because we are indebted to loan sharks. And so loan sharks used to give people small businesses, a $100 loan and they used to charge the $100,000 of it in return. So they-- it was a form of economic slavery. Ah, and Muhammad Yunus wanted to prove the point that poor people have strengths only if you give them a fair chance so instead of charging exorbitant interest rate he change the rules and instead of asking them to beat the odds he change the odds and he started the economic the Grameen Bank which is an economic cooperative according to which they give people reasonably interest rates. What does that do to people? If you give me reasonable interest rates I will get out of poverty which is what he demonstrated no bank wanted to give credit to poor people because poor people are often labeled and stigmatized as lazy and they don't repay their loans. Well, the Grameen Bank has the 99% rate of loan returns and over the years he lifted it up, he lifted 6 million people from poverty through the work of the Grameen Bank. 

00:55:50
Prevention 

00:55:50
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Now I wanna say a word or two about prevention. A lot of the problems that we experience in society could be handled better through prevention. Let me give you an example. 

00:56:10

00:56:45
Prevention 

00:56:45
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY From the hilarious to the serious let me talk about a serious problem which is a cholera epidemic in London. In 1854, there was a cholera epidemic in London. Nobody knew how to cure cholera until they called John Snow. John Snow was a physician. John Snow had pre-- had, ah, a theory that the cholera is a waterborne disease so through detective work, through epidemiological work he figured out that people were getting cholera by drinking water from these pump, the famous Broad Street pump. So what did John Snow do he said, frankly, I don't know how to cure cholera but perhaps there is something I can do to prevent it. So August 9th, 1854 he orders city officials to remove the handle from the Broad Street pump and he stopped the cholera epidemic. 

00:57:40
"No mass disorder, afflicting humankind, has ever been eliminated, or brought under control, by treating the affected individual" 

00:57:40
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY What did we learn from John Snow that no mass disorder, afflicting humankind, has ever been eliminated, or brought under control, by treating the affected individual. Even if John Snow knew how to cure cholera even I knew when I was a school psychologist how to treat child abuse, how to help children with child abuse I did not do anything to prevent new cases from emerging and this is a fundamental truth in the helping professions that for every five children I may help there are 50 new cases who are being abused. The only solution long term is prevention. I learn this from one of my great mentors George Albee who was president of the American Psychological Association and he said, we need to instill this in the future generation of psychologist and educators. 

00:58:40
Prevention saves money • For every $1 invested in prevention, we get up to $17 in return, but we invest only 3% of our budget on prevention. 

00:58:45
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY Prevention saves money. It doesn't just save lives, it saves money. We know from many studies in early childhood education that for every dollar invested in prevention we get up to $17 in return. 

00:58:55
HUGE RETURN ON INVESTMENT HIGH/SCOPE PERRY PRESCHOOL 

00:59:00
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY This is the famous very preschool program. You can see here that for money invested in early childhood education you save these much money in crime prevented, in welfare cost and in education attained. So we know how to do this but often we pay more on to reactive services than proactive services. 

00:59:20
Empowerment • Empowerment can be a tool for social change and personal healing at the same time 

00:59:25
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY What about the empowerment? We all know these people and what we have learned from these leaders is that empowerment is not just a tool for social change but personal healing at the same time. If you remember the Michael Marmot study giving people control over their lives is going to extend their lives. 

00:59:50
Community Change 

00:59:50
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY And finally, let me conclude with community change. I know what you're all thinking, you're thinking that I like going to Europe to have my picture taken which is true but only for educational reasons. So, ah, you know where this picture is from? Venice. And what's the problem with Venice? Venice is sinking. So I learned from a psychologist many years ago a very important quote that reminds us of the dilemmas that we psychologist experience. 

01:00:25
• If Venice "is slowly being submerged, individual citizens cannot afford to ignore their collective fate, because, in the end, they all drown together if nothing is done." (Badcock, 1982) 

01:00:25
ISAAC PRILLELTENSKY If Venice is slowly being submerged, individual citizens cannot afford to ignore their collective fate, because, in the end, they all drown together if nothing, nothing is done and the same with violence. We have to tackle violence and this promotion as a collective enterprise. We have to engage entire communities in preventive ways in empowering ways, in strength-based ways to prevent the cycle of violence from escalating. Thank you.
