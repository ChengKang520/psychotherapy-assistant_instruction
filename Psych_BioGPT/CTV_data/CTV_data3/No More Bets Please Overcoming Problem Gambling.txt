H. G. NELSON Hello, every one. H. G. Nelson(ph) here and you know trying together we’re going to look at the problem of gambling. Now as you can see, I did my money go late in that race that you just saw. As an idiot, you know I’ve selected a horse, didn't have much idea of what I was doing? Why I was there? Neither did the horse. Ah… as it looks like, you know it obviously went very slow and my money went and disappeared into that great thing that suck up all money on every track around Australia but look seriously though people do have a problem with gambling and ah… we are hoping in the next few minutes to give you an idea of some approaches of people who've been there, done what you are doing, think silly, got themselves into trouble and at the same time have the views of experts who've been on the job with gambling and with problem gamblers both here and overseas. 

00:01:40

00:01:45
SIMON You know if I could take it back, you know there’s one thing I wouldn't… would not start off was… the, the first day I went… went to the racetrack. You know if I could take that back I would, but now I can't. So I just have to continue, couple of things(ph) like racing, horseracing and I went to the racetrack you know for very first time and they… they… they were very tamed(ph) race-goers and they analyzed the form and everything on that. In the first bet I, I had on was a winner. So that kicked it off. It was like… I had these strong beliefs that you know I had the system worked out, but I think that was just like I say it was reinforce that myself with… with the odd occasion of wins and… and in reality I never looked at it from a point of view of saying that you know in the horse, whole picture of things, you actually… would you worry at winning? 

00:02:35
MARLENE They never ever knew that I was just down right from here I went to club. For hours and hours and I’ll be there you know, some times I wouldn’t come home at all of course I’ll just stay at the club, put my money, stay there you know I don't want to leave. 

00:02:55
ANNIE All up I gambled for seven years, that's a very long time. Um… and I think when I first worked out, I had a problem. I remember when I, when I, I told myself going home… coming home from the club, well not you are not going to gamble, Annie, tomorrow, you’re not going to gamble. You are not going anywhere near those machines, don't go, you can't afford to lose anything, do yourself a favor don't go. The next day I'd wake up and I'd go. 

00:03:20
Terry & Norelle 

00:03:20
TERRY I can see the lies that I created, I can see the money that I lost, I can see the relationship we lost, and my life was nearly lost everything because of gambling. 

00:03:35
SIMON I was lucky I guess in the early stages and… and… and I was winning and had a good feeling that I, I knew what I was doing and that everything was under control and I was considered expert or something you know I just had this I guess that was a part of it too was… was you had a sense of the feeling that you had achieved something that you…you feel that you… this is a skill that you've mastered or something you know like calculated, it's a calculated feeling (inaudible ). 

00:04:05
MARLENE At first I could handle it pretty well. Yeah I loved shuffle the finances around and pay the bills. But in the end, you just can't, so lucky partly because the more I play the less I had. Alright, so I… I just… in the end I just started running out of money. Last month, I was working myself to death. 

00:04:25
TERRY When you’re in front of them, you… you think it's hot, use me friend it's great you know you're going to pay me some money, give it a rub and you know all those stupid things. And but you do it, you don't think straight, you are thinking what you want to think and what you want the things going to happen. Ah… oh you’re hoping it's going to happen. 

00:04:45
MARLENE I was one of these… one of those category of gamblers who believe there is a method to the machine oh, this… actually there's probably a lot who do believe that I go out to actually do something with my brain, I’d go try and beat these machines. 

00:05:05
[sil.] 

00:05:10
H. G. NELSON Today I was great through to be joined by Tony Shilling(ph). Can we go and talk poker machines? As you know, I love poker machines. I'm the poker machine freak. Tony, ah… how come you know about poker machines? 

00:05:20
TONY Well, I spent a lot of time at the university learning about subject related to that. So I've been studying them for quite a few years I'm also a president of a research company and we've done a lot of work for government and private industry in the design of these machines and testing them and seeing how the impact upon consumers and gamblers. 

00:05:40
H. G. NELSON Now, Tony, everybody sort of people winning big on the poker machines. You’d never hear about big losses, only hear about big wins. 

00:05:45
TONY That's right. So what happens is that, have you ever gone around and told someone about the losses that you've had? No. You know, you don't go and say I lost a bundle today. But if you win big, if you had the big prize then you are going to run and tell some people. And so what happens in conversation about these machines, they are going to say to somebody else, look, I know someone who won a whole bunch of money. And so what happens is your big win is going to be heard by, say, 50 people. What that means is, ah… your 50 times is likely to hear about a big winner or someone winning big and what they did with all the money as you are to actually experience the win yourself. 

00:06:20
MARLENE In the probably two years I played the card machines, I probably won 500 once, only once and I think that's what caught me hooked(ph) because it was like in that first period of actually starting to play and I’ve won the jackpot, thinking well you know I, I can do this again, alright like keep to my system, I will be fine, alright, but in club working on it would be… 

00:06:50
ANNIE I’ve been to clubs way, so there has been a long weekend. This just happened um… like Easter or something when a lot of people going and they throw money down the machines, this is people just having a fun not necessarily gamblers and they might put in as much as $50, sort of $20 and they walk away leaving that money in there, while gamblers know that and they will go along and they will think, oh, look there is a lot of people who’ve, who don't know what they're doing here. They have put a whole lot of money in this machine, I will just have to play it for ten, twenty minutes and play high um… and ah… then I don’t probably win all that money. 

00:07:35
H. G. NELSON …hearing(ph) it people say you’re likely to be more lucky after a long weekend because the machines are full of money and therefore they must pay out. 

00:07:40
TONY There is no truth to it, but a lot of people believe that. 

00:07:45
H. G. NELSON Hmm… Hmm… 

00:07:45
TONY Ah… and they think you know over the long run, this machine has to pay out… 

00:07:45
H. G. NELSON Hmm… Hmm… 

00:07:50
TONY …and if a lot of people put money in and maybe a lot of them have lost, then I can win something on, say, Monday. Ah… that's false. And the reason is because every spin is independent. Now what I mean by that is if you have five wins in a row, the machine doesn't remember that, the next time it plays, ah… it's going to either win or lose totally independent of what's going on in the past. So whether a whole bunch of people have lost a bunch of money on that machine or won a bunch of money on that machine does not in the slightest bit affect what happens when you step up to that machine and play it. 

00:08:25
TERRY You, you will think it’s in the next spin, it’s in the next spin, you know it's coming closer, it's coming closer. But each time when you put in $50 in the machine and… and playing 500 credits, so that doesn’t give um… that’s when you, that’s when I started up and started putting in a hundred at a time and then playing you know two to five hundred credits because I thought well it’s ready to pay us, it’s ready to pay. I’ve reserved a machine after putting, say, $500 or 1000 and I’ve reserved it about a time got more money because I thought here account is just… it will come within the next $100. So I gave you another 500 or a 1000 and after that’s gone, still haven't got the jackpot and here I was saying it’s coming, it’s coming. 

00:09:10
TONY Now just to give you an idea what’s going on most people think every time they push that button the machine plays a game, but what they don’t realize is these machines are constantly playing by themselves, and in fact they will generate thousand games each second, each second, so that is 60,000 games in a minute and in a minute you can get up go over and take a sip of a cup of coffee or something like that, walk back to the machine, sit down and it’s played 60,000 games in that time. So whatever you are doing is totally independent of what’s going on in the past. 

00:09:45
MARLENE If I set this way, you know if I set certain way, pressed the button in a certain way, it… you know it was sort of a win. Um… if I went too slow, I thought if I pushed the button too slow, you know it will… it, it’ll have rest and it’ll change or something you know and so I just keep pressing, just one after, one after and I was just like… my finger was just going so quickly, but my money went quicker. 

00:10:20
H. G. NELSON No strategies for playing machines, you know I've got a bloke who takes a lucky brick(ph) in with him and stands on that and some people on that play within those. Is there any way of developing a strategy to ensure that you can turn up a winner playing poker machines. 

00:10:30
TONY There is no strategy that will beat these machines. Lots of people have different strategies. They increase or decrease their bets ah… and they play different times a day, they play different machines, but they’re independent, and they are random every time they play. So there is no way you can possibly beat these machines with any kind of strategy or by using lucky charms or depending on luck, it just doesn't work. 

00:10:55
MARLENE But you don’t know this when you are playing the pokies, you don’t know that the machines are random and I’ve worked on system trying to think that I’ll beat the odds which was wrong, absolutely wrong. 

00:11:10
H. G. NELSON Master machine pay back to the player a certain percentage of the money that goes into it? 

00:11:15
TONY Yes, they do. And there is a minimum that they have to pay out usually between 85 and 87% although many of the venues may set it at a higher level. And what you have to understand is then when you bet, let's say, you're betting a dollar, ah…you may get back 90 cents on average, and so ah… that comes in the form of credits, wins, that sort of thing. Now ah… that's costing you then 10 cents, if you're betting a dollar every time you press. If it takes you to, say, six seconds to play each game, then you are going to play ten games in a minute. So you are losing [00:11:5010 cents every game, it's going to cost you a buck a minute. So it's pretty easy to figure out that over an hour, on average, you are going to lose $60. Now if you double your bet to, on average, say, to $2 a game, then you are going to lose 120 bucks an hour. You know some days, you are going to be up, some days you are going to be down. It's rare that's going to come out to exactly $60 in that hour. But over the long run, it's going to cost you to play. 

00:12:15
ANNIE No matter what believes you've got about how those machines work, in the end, they’ll take your money from you and you have far, far less money and it goes on and on and on and the further you… the longer you go gambling the more you lose. So that's the proof. It's not… it's not like if my theories were correct, I might… might have lost for the first six months, so until I got the knack of the machines and then I might… might start winning, um… but that didn't happen, did it? 

00:12:55
SIMON The big race is on, my bets are getting bigger, I feel more confident and then… and then I guess the luck went out and started to diminish after that, so I started losing and it wasn't out of control losing, it was just um… you know a loss and also at the beginning, but at the end of the day I used to be in front a lot of the time in the beginning and then… this was at certain day, you'd be behind and then it got behind big because my bets were getting bigger. Um… so… so luck is a bit of a (inaudible ). 

00:13:25
TERRY I remember one time I bought a drink and I had one mouthful out of it and was down $500 in a mouthful. We all come up here one time, we had a drink with maybe two drinks and she turned around and she said to me you just lost a month of my wages what I earn… in two drinks. 

00:13:40
NORELLE Hmm… 

00:13:45
ANNIE There were days when I was putting as much as $1000 and I could have kept going because I had (inaudible ). I still had my house at the time well, I'm lucky I still do, but I had two houses then I have lost one in the meantime. 

00:14:00
SIMON And then when the casino opened I think that was when I really was into a big time um… because I, I might been to the card games like blackjack, it’s (inaudible ) the bets are bigger. I went on to larger higher limit tables and things like that. So yeah, and it just went on from there. 

00:14:25
[sil.] 

00:14:30
H. G. NELSON And now I'm joined by Michael Walker, and Michael, you are an expert in blackjack. How do you get interested in it and… and how much you know thought you’d be getting in the game? 

00:14:35
MICHAEL WALKER I though you could win a blackjack, so that's how I got interested. I studied blackjack, practiced blackjack, wrote a book on blackjack, played it seriously seven hours a day, day in day out. I have to tell you, you can't win a blackjack. 

00:14:50
H. G. NELSON And is there a system or a number of systems you can apply to the game of blackjack. 

00:14:55
MICHAEL WALKER Yes, so it's one of those games that's got some skill in it. So the thing about that is if you are really skillful, you can lose slowly and if you are not skillful, you'll lose quickly. 

00:15:05
SIMON I thought at the time it was… a lot of skills involving you know if you play your cards right, you work it out the number, it's a bit of a numbers game, if you work it out, yes, you can switch the odds into the player's favor to somewhat or that's what I used to think and if you play you know certain… certain rules out of play in blackjack for example and I had to stick by those rules pretty much all the time. 

00:15:30
H. G. NELSON Is it possible to using, say, the best strategy available to win at the cards? 

00:15:35
MICHAEL WALKER No it isn't. Um… applying the best strategy like ah… in the long run, play long enough and you will lose. That is because the casinos have got an edge and that set up the game so that you actually can't extract a winning edge from it. What will happen if you play perfect blackjack is that you will lose whether you play perfect or imperfect blackjack, it sometimes will be up and you will think gee(ph) I'm doing well and sometimes you’ll be down, you will think that was bad luck. Well on the whole, it's whole luck and you will go down. The longer you play I mean if you play for just one evening, you might be lucky and have a win, you might be unlucky and have a loss, but play long enough and it's guarantee that you are not going to win. 

00:16:20
SIMON I didn't say that way because I thought that I had it worked out in that. If I apply myself better, if I would, if I work at it a bit more, I improve my skills and I thought that was… that was um… the way to get out of it because you could improve yourself, you learn by yourself and you improve. There was a belief that you got yourself into, into problem by gambling, but you can get yourself out by… by gambling which is… which is crazy you know and gambling is… is… is a losing pit. You just go… you just go down and you don’t say it’s just it's like your… your pigs in your troughs. You had this a little bit of pig, but you have a massive trough and you have a little bit of pig again, but that pig can never cover all your troughs. So at the end of the day you always go down. 

00:17:05
MICHAEL WALKER Chasing losses is the biggest foolish idea that there is in gambling. Um… the thing is that you’re going to get back the money you lost. The whole system is against that. If you took your money and put it in the bank and get 3%, you will do better than playing blackjack. 

00:17:25
ANNIE I started to get scared about the amount of money that I was losing and um… I thought, gee(ph) at this rate I, I could lose a substantial amount of money. 

00:17:40
SIMON I still wakeup like out of a nightmare and my side of the bed would be soaking sweat like you know just west, because I will be in the night sweating under that much stress that no one… no one else in the whole world knew what I was doing and was only myself and I felt like so isolated. I really was desperate. And um… so I had to I guess utilize my position to access you know funds that I… I could access, you know, illegally I guess. My memory, I remember figures of like 100,000 you know 80,000 things of that, so it was… there was a lot of money you know involved. The actual time in jail was about eight… eight and a half to nine months and then on works release which is you had to… you know which is you had to go to work and then you come back and you spend the rest of the time in jail so and that was other nine months or so. 

00:18:35
TERRY Everything, everything would go on gambling. Ah… no foods in the cupboard, nothing you know… 

00:18:45
[sil.] 

00:18:50
NORELLE I walked out, I walked out and I left him alone for a week and he’ll say please come back as… as they do. You know please come back we'll… if I come back you know we need to say… we need to do something about this and that's where he agreed to go to counseling and we started going to the Wesley Mission that in the beginning, as I said, it was admitting the problem but denying it at the same time. And he would sit there and listen and… and talk about… talk the talk(ph) and say what they wanted to hear. And in the beginning, I, I think I’m rather right and then I realized that he is only there to shut me up. 

00:19:35
MARLENE No, I don't need counseling. You know I can handle this myself. I can stop gambling whenever I want to. I wasn’t there for most three to four years. I thought that even after I confessed to mom and Karina(ph) it took me at least another year and a half to go to counseling. 

00:19:55
SIMON The solicitor recommended me to say this particular person in this gambling treatment place and then I went to see her at my solicitors advice I guess. And… and that was the first time I ever saw a person one on one about my problem. And I think that background he don’t want to show signs of weakness and you don’t want to show signs that… of, of losing faith that you know you’ve done something that you, you can’t control that kind of thing, so that’s the one of the reasons why I didn’t let it out in the early stages especially. 

00:20:30
ANNIE When you get to a stage where gambling is hurting your life a lot. I told her my story and I cried and cried over a few things, because I really felt like I was caught in the grip of something I had no control over. And, um… and I was going to lose everything if I didn’t stop, I was terribly upset. So I… I was able to get rid of all that and talk to someone who really understood and who wasn’t judging me for it at all. 

00:20:55
MARLENE The relief I felt when I said her when I was first went there and you know she didn’t judge me, she didn’t… you know she just sat me down and… and that just all came out. Everything just all came out. And it was like (inaudible ) she just said that she listened and it was like (inaudible ) I could never talk to my flatmate(ph) or my mom like this. 

00:21:25
SONDRA If you just have a look at this for a moment… 

00:21:30
ANNIE She got me to also look very carefully and it is front on how much money I had lost, and how much money if I continue to gamble how much more money I would lose and where I would be if I keep going. 

00:21:45
SIMON Keeping a record of… of… um…how much you bet and how much I was winning and how much I was losing, and it was about 3, 4 months and I used to write down because it got sick of it and printed originally and I was just writing down and… and… and just at that point I think yeah I realized that that wasn’t… I wasn’t really in the front. I felt like I was in the front. The feeling was, but when you actually look at the figures, you… you… you would, you know when you did the tally, you tallied it up at the end of the period, and you think now you thought you’re front but in reality you lost a whole lot more than you thought that you were… it was square(ph) where you’re in front. If you don’t write it down that… that one of wins that you have just reinforces that you think you win, but in reality that is not the case, you know and that really you know proved in… in black and white at least is that you know it doesn’t work. 

00:22:40
MARLENE And when you actually see the amount like that you’ve put in the machine, you think how the hell did I have that much money. I didn’t even know I had that much money. 

00:22:50
SONDRA When we looked at the difference between games of chance… 

00:22:55
ANNIE Yes. What the gambling counselor taught me was a system of thinking the challenges your… your thoughts about why you gamble. 

00:23:05
ANNIE If you think, oh, I am going to feel more relaxed if I go gambling, I am going to feel better when I… when I go gambling, I am going to be escaping. If you examine one of those thoughts, you’ll find in question and you’ll find that they’re totally untrue and that all your reasons for going gambling are frankly not true. So she got to put this paper out and we went through all the good things about gambling and what made me gamble. What that did was it made me aware of why I gambled? Then she got out another lot of paper and we talked about what was the bad things and that’s… that’s what cuts through the denial of what it’s doing to you. 

00:23:50
TERRY I was… hmm.. 

00:23:50
NORELLE Set up. 

00:23:50
TERRY Set up. Oh, you set up. 

00:23:55
NORELLE For a better word yeah. 

00:23:55
TERRY I went down there and I'm thinking here we go or up I don’t tell him last time, what I've got to tell him this time. I walked in there and it was straight off in a row and two counselors. Well I didn’t know what I had coming to me, but they had already conspired before this of what’s going to happen and how we’re going to front Terry . And here I was going and they’re thinking what lies am I going to tell them that I can cover my tracks and everything like that. 

00:24:20
NORELLE Hmm… 

00:24:20
TERRY When I got in there, it was straight to the lion’s den, after that I admitted. 

00:24:20
NORELLE That’s why he started to take up the denial part yeah. 

00:24:30
TERRY Yes. 

00:24:30
NORELLE So, it was a major confrontation and from that point, it was… take all access to funds away from Terry and he didn’t like that at all. 

00:24:40
TERRY I was against him at first for doing what they were doing to me… because that cut me off. Not cut me off love, cut me off funds. And then I realized everyone wants to help, not against me. 

00:25:00
ANNIE She gave me a tape ah… which is like a guided meditation. And what you do as you put the tape on in your living room and you sit down and you relax and you close your eyes, and then it gets you to visualize going to the club or the place that you would normally go to gamble at, and you visualize going and then you think a hold on, um… I don’t need to do this anymore, I can walk away. So you visualize yourself go… wanting to go and then pulling back and not going. So somehow it puts you more in the state of control where you… you make the decision not to go and gamble. It seems to have a very good effect, it did actually helped me quite a lot. They would ask me exactly how it works, I don’t know. But it’s got something to do with feeling more in control of… of your problem. 

00:25:55
That's going they’re now changing your mind. 

00:26:00
ANNIE After seeing Sondra by herself maybe three months, I then went into a group that she formed of ex-gamblers. It’s a self-support group. And I think these kind of groups are excellent. You all will understand you all accept each other, you know what it’s like. 

00:26:20
MARLENE Staying away from the places which some time… The group session was what saved me, because these men um… had been there, same with (inaudible ) had been there. It was actually what’s the old saying you know a gambler knows how gambler feels or an alcoholic knows how an alcoholic feel. that’s how I felt with these. I felt bonded with them. Because I’ve never met other people that would talk about their problems like that. 

00:26:50
The seat and we’re losing the trust… 

00:26:55
ANNIE That group was lasted only probably for about 10 weeks and then unfortunately stopped. It was around Christmas time or some holiday time or something and people couldn’t come to it anymore and so we had a break from it and it was during that break that I took it up again. So my past that was…I think I probably relapsed for about six months maximum. And then I went back to her. It could have been less than that I forget. I need you to learn from your mistakes. You just learn why did I relapse what… what went wrong there. 

00:27:35
TERRY I did blow up… 

00:27:35
NORELLE Hmm. 

00:27:40
TERRY …once and I was disappointed in myself. I didn’t lie about it I told Norelle I lost it. 

00:27:50
NORELLE Hmm. 

00:27:50
TERRY But that was the last one, last one. 

00:27:55
NORELLE Yeah. And when that happens there is no point to jumping up and down and screaming out and saying oh, you're just going back to gambling again and this and that. Progressing there and just continued to support, because as long as Terry felt good about himself and where he was heading, the more progress we made. 

00:28:15
TERRY Well, I was saying how the counselor come over and I said to him I blown it, after a month of blown it. He said no you haven’t blown it, you have had a setback. He said it’s 30 days without gambling one you did and that sort of picked me up a bit, because that… at that time after I've done that, I was a mess with myself disappointed with myself. 

00:28:35
NORELLE Hmm. 

00:28:35
TERRY Everything. And then after that I thought there is going to be no more one days, no more. And there hasn’t been a day since. 

00:28:45
ANNIE I didn’t stop immediately, ah… but I stopped gambling about a week after I went to the counselor. 

00:28:50
SONDRA And how much continued to be put back in? 

00:28:55
ANNIE Basically it was strategies that she would help me with. That was what I didn’t have before. I didn’t know what strategies to draw on. And the strategies they’re all about as I said keeping money away from yourself, just having enough in your pocket to get food or whatever you needed to get, but keeping big money away from yourself. And also um… ah… alternatives to gambling What Sondra would call alternatives to gambling. So you think about what you could do instead that’s healthy, because remember if you’ve been gambling for a long period of time, you don’t have anything else in your life. What I found most helpful was getting fit, being physically healthy is one of the most rewarding things and most strengthening things you can do for yourself. I started going to a yoga class, which was very good for me. I started walking more. 

00:30:00
SIMON Everybody is different. Things work different, may work well with others and may not work well with others as well, and something that might… might be same might and it does work for somebody and other person may think it’s stupid like this running of morning's running, I don’t know how other people say it but did worked for me very well because I got rid of the energy that every time I had a urge that I wanted to gamble, I just ran as high I could or play sport was another thing. I used to play basketball, play basketball and something. But running was good because you don't need a thing but you don't need anybody else to be with you and you can do at anytime and you can do at 3 am in the morning, you can do at anytime you want. Just that whenever you got this urge I just put on my shoes and just run and run until, not just run jog run until you are really tired, just to get the energy out of the system. 

00:30:45
TERRY The best thing is to do is keep your mind occupied, whether you go for a walk, fix something and do something, but just keep occupied. 

00:30:50
NORELLE Well I started to set a task for him daily. 

00:30:55
TERRY Yeah. 

00:30:55
NORELLE That something might needed to be fixed in the garden or whatever, I knew it would take you know a few hours to do. 

00:31:05
TERRY And I’ll make up a list of things to do today. 

00:31:10
ANNIE Actually one of the best things I do is to go back to work. I went back to work fulltime. And it keeps you out of trouble. So ah… I was and mixed up with all that is that when you gamble you lose touch with the real meaning of money. Money becomes not $50 notes that you feed into a machine. You lose touch with the fact that the money is actually money that you‘ve earned with your hard work that you need to pay a bill with. That money is what you’re going to pay for the food at the supermarket next week. 

00:31:45
TERRY If you’re going to stop gambling, you got to stop that circle of friends, because they weren’t ready to give up, they weren’t ready to say they had a problem. They were ready to keep going. Well, I couldn’t go up there and sit with them because they would be sitting at the machines. 

00:32:05
ANNIE I went to the security desk one day and said look hmm..I would like to have myself banned from the casino and he said yes madam come this way. 

00:32:15
MARLENE Before you even start on a machine, you always have that first thought, which is true you do have that first thought, I’ve got $20 on me, I've got to go I could buy. I’m going to go and get some bread and milk um… but that thought is just the first you think oh, I’ll just put it in the machine you know I’ll just and then that’s when it start. And she explained that it's that first thought that she wants to catch that you can resist it, you can say no, I don’t want to do it. 

00:32:50
NORELLE Probably about three months from that point where there was a major confrontation between the counselors and myself and Terry. Let’s say I would probably be good three months where he was very, very angry and depressed and um… sort of in a point of despair. 

00:33:10
TERRY Yeah. 

00:33:10
NORELLE He didn’t know what to do, where to turn because… 

00:33:10
TERRY There was no one to turn to. There was no way to turn. I had no money, no nothing. I had no pride, no self-esteem, no, nothing I’ve lost all of that. 

00:33:20
NORELLE For me I kept looking back and thinking I’ve…this isn’t the person that I met. This isn’t the person that I fell in love. There is a… there is a bit aside to this person and I’ve seen it. And this is someone who I don’t know and he needs help, he definitely needs help. And I think that's a major part of it when… when you go into recovery, family got to be there to support. You’ve got to go to the meetings with them, you’ve also go to get counseling yourself, on a one on one basis with counselors but to be there to support is a big part of recovery. 

00:34:05
TERRY The first six months are very, very, very tough. 

00:34:05
NORELLE Hmm. 

00:34:05
TERRY Because you got to earn back all your trust and you got to do that very slowly. It took about three months before I was allowed to pay a bill, or was allowed any money to go down to pay a bill or anything, wasn't it? 

00:34:20
NORELLE Hmm. 

00:34:20
TERRY And I used to get a bus, I’d come home and I’ll put them on the bench (inaudible ). 

00:34:26
NORELLE Hmm. 

00:34:26
TERRY And then I felt like that was a, that was a good feeling yeah. 

00:34:35
ANNIE Every morning I would go for a coffee before work and I’ll take out my little notepad and I would write down why or how did gambling hurt my life. And it didn’t take long to do, I’d write down, sometimes I would write completely different things. But it’s a constant reminder, what it does to your relationships? How much money you have lost? What it does to your self-esteem? How it can just put you out of work? How scary it can be? How much fear you constantly live with day in and day out? 

00:35:10
SIMON So I just didn’t… I think just keep on trying if I haven’t… I’d just tell about it, just don't give up, just keep on trying whatever it takes you know. Like you see, you might find something that no one else even tried before that might… that might work and I think you just got to keep on trying and don't give up at it. If you really want to stop, you know. I mean if you really want… want a life other than the gambling life, you have to keep on trying. 

00:35:40
MARLENE I can see what my money is doing now. And I see it my daughter, the close she with, the things she does, um… tennis, put her in tennis class. I once had a gambling problem. I have passed that and I'm just moving on. 

00:36:00
SONDRA So you’ve got other options. 

00:36:00
ANNIE …or ring someone. I still see my counselor about two years after I’ve stopped and I don’t go that often, I would go maybe once a month or once a fortnight and it helps a lot because I still have experience an impulse or two now and then when life gets a bit tough and it’s really good to be able to just go and talk to somebody about that and get it out of your system and also go back and be reminded of the strategies that they’ve taught you before about how to stop, because even after all that time you can forget sometimes. 

00:36:40
TERRY You start to do things, things that you know we never used to do, because I never had money to do it. Now the way here is fantastic. It really is. 

00:36:50
NORELLE At this point it’s great, yeah. 

00:36:50
TERRY And… and I honestly believe I couldn’t… I couldn’t be same what where we’re today two years ago there is no worry. On the whole we don’t think of… thought of doing this Um… but how everything has changed and turned so much to the better, it’s incredible. 

00:37:10
NORELLE Hmm 

00:37:10
TERRY It’s hard at first but you get through… you can get through it and anyone can get through it, but if I can, anyone can I reckon. So… 

00:37:20
NORELLE Yeah.
