ALEXANDER MCFARLANE I've been asked to be a discussant for the, uhm, this afternoon's presentations and this morning's presentations. Uhm, and I must say it's been, ah, a fascinating day because I guess it really just brings to mind I guess about the complexities of people, uhm, and the complexities of the mind. And I think one of the great challenges that we have as clinicians is how we actually build a model of the mind and also have it consistent way of approaching patients and I think, ah, what we've seen today is, ah, I guess a depth, ah, and reflectiveness from all the speakers about, uhm, ah, sometimes slightly contradictory but equally, uhm, compelling ways of, ah, thinking about and how we might modulate people's lives and experiences. And, uhm, it was interesting after the first session, ah, I've been, uhm, looking at some slides on my computer and the woman sitting behind me came up to me and said, "Look, can you please give me a slide about, ah, the neuro networks involved in meditation?" And, uhm, "I'm obviously looking at some of your imaging slides" and she thought that's what I was doing but I, I respond by saying, well, really that is a fascinating question because, uhm, I think the fact is that we do want a model, we do want to have a way of having a sense of what are the neurostructures that involve in treating patients. Uhm, but the problem is it's not that simple and I, and I think that's what I'd really like to talk about because, uhm, I, I guess in the course of today, we've seen how there are variety of, ah, research findings and, ah, models of neuro imaging studies that can explain what's going on. Uhm, but, ah, it, it's very difficult I think sometimes to have one model that will explain everything. I think one of the first things that we need to really think about, uhm, is about how, uhm, in fact we have a series of different states of mind and it's that loss of flexibility of living in different states of mind that, ah, I guess we've been talking about today and about how they might be, ah, addressed in treatment. And, uhm, I think one of the first things we need to do is to think about how post traumatic stress disorder or complex traumatization, however you wanna talk about it actually is in the single state. Uhm, in the first instance, ah, we know how people have been traumatized, get captured by this intense and extreme, uhm, awareness of the past where the past comes alive in the present and this doesn't come alive in the normal world of imagery. I comes alive in, ah, a whole series of sensory dimensions as well. And, the-- that has always had been researched and what are we talking about here? We're talking about the few circuitry of the bride. So there's been a whole body of neuro imaging research that has addressed that issue. The second thing is, uhm, we've talked also a lot about how people who are traumatized into these numb associated states, uhm, and get locked in a world where they lose their capacity for effectiveness and, uhm, I guess one of the things we've been, ah, Ruth has talked about particularly and, ah, Paul about it. I guess the whole default mode network and the importance of understanding its role, uhm, as underpinning some of those numb and dissociative states. It always reminds me, uhm, ah, of a patient, uhm, in early in my career who, who told me that one of the things that he found most difficult after having developed post traumatic stress disorder was how he lost the capacity to have social conversation. And I think one of the things that we-- in, in, ah, we've all been doing today is reflecting on what we're hearing about. We don't credit our own narrative and, ah, in a, in a sense, that's what I'm doing here now. Is standing up, telling you the story which I've composed out of what's been spoken of today and that is one of these abilities that these people lose because if you think about how you actually engage in social conversation, the party. It's actually not a linear conversation, it's not a logical sequence. It's because somebody told us your story that reminds you of something that mightn't be obviously directly related but has a, has an intuitive logic in the social action to it and that's how we communicate with each other. It's by that ability to engage in a fluid and flowing, uhm, narrative that is all about sharing stories. And I think we've pretty missed and I think underestimated the importance, uhm, of that disruption to people who are traumatized because it's not something that you naturally see. I mean, it's just a very quiet part of our life. And if a patient has lost that ability to see themselves. It's in the sense the very thing they can't tell you about. It's a bit like if you're numb, the very thing you can't describe, uhm, is your numbing. Uhm, the, ah, and I think the whole default night-- network has really brought a new dimension to, ah, understanding of the, ah, neuro biology, uhm, of, of PTSD and how we might need to address it in treatment. Uhm, I think the, the third dimension of, ah, in neuro imaging and brain function that we need to think about is that people with PTSD in fact don't spend most of their time, ah, preoccupied by the trauma. Ah, they are not necessarily in a, in a emo-- emotionally numb state. It's about their difficulty about engaging currently in their environment. It's about their ability to hold a, uhm, brief but intense awareness of their immediate environment. I mean, the patient that, ah, Ruth showed with the video had all those disruptions and her EEG. It was a great example of how that capacity to hold the environment was being associated and, and disrupted in that moment. And our ability, our working memory, ah, and the working memory, ah, and the working memory circuitry, the salience networks which we've heard about today are absolutely critical, uhm, in, in the ability to attend to focus, to be aware, ah, and then behind all these, ah, I guess is the whole, ah, dimension of, ah, our awareness of our internal psychophysiology, uhm, and the way they constantly are in (inaudible ) ourselves and when these talk today about the disruption of the internal psychophysiology and preparedness and the orientation that, ah, uhm, physiology gives this to our world. I mean, in a sense we, we are constantly being drawn into what is salient or otherwise to our immediate survival and if we've been disrupted in those domains either by losing our reactivity being overly reactive. It's extremely difficult to negotiate your way through the world. And, and I think that's one of the other dimensions that we always need to think about. Again, uhm, ah, the, the, ah, that, that when he showed us-- highlighted this group and the difference between the people of-- ah, I've got a single instant trauma as against these moderately traumatized people and, uhm, Ruth, ah, and Eric Metinov(ph) have recently published, ah, some interesting papers focusing on how the people who are numbed would have this complete over reac-- over activity at the, the frontal networks, ah, are in a sense the reverse of the people of the people who are in this overactive state with this that lost the suppression of (inaudible ) activity bifrontal networks. So, uhm, I think what we need to think about is how in fact they're a-- there are these different dimensions and ultimately, ah, success as human beings, uhm, is about our ability to flexible switch between these different states of mind. And it reminded me, uhm, of a book that Marty Horowitz-- now I'm sure how many people have-- men read Marty Horowitz's original book that he wrote. It was very influential really getting PTSD on the map. He also wrote a wonderful, uhm, ah, book about, uhm, ah, mi-- states of mind where even healthy people-- when you think about yourself, you know, you, you connect as a professional, ah, you can, uhm, act as a person who can engage in fun. Ah, you can act as a person whose compassionate with your friends, you can act as a disciplinarian with your children, uhm, you-- there are multiple different states that you have and the ability to, uhm, access those aspects of yourself and to use them in an appropriate modulated way is the essence of a healthy life. And the disruption, uhm, of that, uhm, capacity, uhm, is something that I think we probably don't sort of talk about enough, uhm, in the, ah, treatment of, ah, of, of, of people and I think that's one of the things that we've really been talking about today. It's really about how, uhm, you, you really bring together the sense of the present self and how, uhm, I think mind, mind from this meditation can be extremely helpful for people who really lack that ability to just orientate themselves, uhm, in the moment as against, ah, the ability to have a narrative self. And in having a narrative self is an equally complex issue, uhm, and, you know, it's not a new idea. I mean, Freud talked about the observing ego. Uhm, and one of the, uhm, images that I, ah, always think of in that, in that regard is remember, I had a-- did a wonderful painting, uhm, which was entitled, ah, the Portrait, uhm, of Saint Matthew and it's a painting where you can see, ah, Matthew with a quill in his hand, writing, uhm, the gospel. And then the longer you look at the painting you suddenly realize that over his right shoulder there's an angel that's whispering into his ear and, and I think it really conveys that sense if how, uhm, the ability to reflect and to describe and to create, ah, a narrative in ourselves requires that an observer who sits on our shoulder, uhm, and having an active relationship with that part of yourself, uhm, is, ah, I think sometimes a very challenging demanding and demanding state to be in particularly when you're highly emotionally aroused. It's about being able to have that observer who can come, redirect, orientate and I think what we have really been hearing about today is a variety of techniques and methods, uhm, about how to, ah, bring those, uhm, states, uhm, ah, to, to build the past. Now, you know, what, what is it always, uhm, tells and what are people, ah, about traumatized people-- and what have we relearned, uhm, from, from today. And, ah, I'd like to summarize it just briefly because, ah, that we all know that it gets worse I think, sort of contemplating the difference, ah, the different dimensions. I think the first issue is about the loss of ability to be in the present and that's got several dimensions to it. I mean, the person, uhm, who has been traumatized in a sense, their memory isn't like normal memory. The, the beautiful thing about memory is that everything, every single word you hear, everything you see, your mind is searching for something similar in the past but what you're not aware of it for example the first time you heard some of the words of I've just spoken. It's a completely unconscious process but where we'd been constantly drawn through our life by this richness of experience and the difference about trauma obviously is that in fact the memory sits between you and your ability to experience what's happening now so that the present in a sense, looses, uhm, its salience and loses its current dominance as it should have in your experience. What occurs is that the experience that has been evoked by the present come to dominate your awareness and when you think about it, that is gross disruption of capacity to be ourselves. But the paradox on the other side of that is, uhm, you know, I guess, uhm, and, and what Paul was talking about this, uhm, as well. it was this, this whole issue about emotional numbing. And if you feel nothing, this probably, ah, in some ways I think, ah, know more painful experience because the inability to feel pleasure, the inability to, to taste and enjoy things, uhm, and the, the dateness(ph) that that leaves you with, uhm, is, ah, and extraordinary sense of disconnection with your life, ah, and your relationship and I think again we've been hearing today, ah, about the role, uhm, of various forms of meditation that allow people to better engage in, in, uhm, themselves and I guess the importance of circuitry such as the, the insular, ah, in, in, in getting those parts of the brain activated so that we can better, ah, feel and understand. And, uhm, ah, I suppose a second dimension to this is about the loss of meaning, uhm, and the loss about associative capacity that, ah, Ruth was talking about, uhm, with, ah, the, the disruption of the, ah, default networks. And I think one of the really interesting, uhm, ah, contrast that occurred in a couple of the presentations today was the issue of, uhm, the engagement of salient as against the default networks cuz, ah, Ruth and her group my, my research colleagues, we, ah, did, did some work looking at the interaction between these two networks and one of the things that happens in PTSD is in fact you get simultaneous engagement of the salients and default networks and that the inability of people to in a se-- sense separate their states of mind, ah, whi-- which is one of the, the, the difficulties. And I think that's why, uhm, the presentation of John Kevin Sinly(ph) spoke about that study which showed the increased activation of the right association areas in people who ma-- ah, ah, ah, learned mindfulness and the deactivation, the default network tells you about something about their ability of the-- of the meditation to in a sense, separate the default and the salience network functionings. And that's something that I think we are really beginning today to get some really very interesting, uhm, insights into. Uhm, another really important issues, this issue about problems of reactivity because the model traumatized person who doesn't experience the same degree of heart rate reactivity to a threatening stimulus, you can see how in a sense that constantly then allows you to walk into danger. And one-- I had an interesting conversation with in the, uhm, uhm, uhm, afternoon tea break because I think it's a very interesting issue when we think about complex traumatization model. Traumatization is being something related to child abuse, uhm, ah, and child neglect but I think it's also an issue that probably is quite prevalent amongst soldiers who've had model trauma exposures and police officers and ambulance officers, uhm, and medical practitioner who deal with traum-- model trauma victims. And I think probably, uhm, in part two it, it, it come to affect us in the work, ah, as trauma therapist. And, uhm, and I think we need to, ah, begin to be much more, uhm, ah, aware, uhm, of the issue of reactivity not just in, in the, in the childhood trauma, ah, populations. So just to summarize, uhm, I think the critical issue really is that there are a multiplicity of patient populations and, uhm, from what I've been talking about you can see that all these different networks that interact and the ability of people to move in and out of those different networks is likely to be very different professions. And, uhm, and I think what we've gotta be careful about is having single approaches that we apply to everybody. Uhm, and, ah, one of the interesting things about much of the neuro imaging research that's being shown today is that essentially there are group results. We get 10, 15, 20 patients and then you look at the similarities across, across those groups. But when you actually start doing single studies you actually find there's enormous variability even within those groups. And I think one of the, the, the real trains that we need to be moving toward is about, ah, the personalized assessment, the people's physiology and I think what other things that's-- I think somewhat disappointing about where our field-- and I think mental, ah, in general sense is that we have done all of this neuro science research over the last 3 decades but it's amazing how little of it has actually impacted on clinical practice. You know, we're not doing these measurements on individual patients. Now, who would go to a cardiologist not, not have your electrophysiology tested, nobody. So how come we actually haven't really introduced this in the clinical practice and partly it's a reimbursement issue. Uhm, and I think it's an issue which our profession really-- or our professions really haven't, uhm, adequately advocated because, ah, you have to have a model of the mind. It has to be filed within neuroscience and if you're not measuring it in individual patient, how can you practice, ah, in an appropriate, ah, in an appropriate way? Uhm, and I just like to, uhm, finish up by, uhm, ah, a couple of, uhm, reflections, uhm, that De-- Damasio, ah, has made. He in the past about the nature of consciousness. Uhm, in particular, uhm, what-- and I think one of the things that we need to think about is how the consequences of traumatic stress does provide a very unique widow for us beginning to understand neurobiology and the phenomenology of consciousness. And one of the things about post traumatic stress disorder, I think we often forget how important it has been in the developments of our understanding of mental, ah, disorders really going back to the 19th century and how people like Janet and Charcot, uhm, really saw trauma disorders as being disorders of consciousness. Uhm, and the fragmentation of the-- and the people's ability to engage and hold their environment and their world together. And I think what we have seen in the presentations today is how far in some ways we've progressed along their path but if we don't think about trauma as the disruption of our capacity to integrate our environment, we actually miss a great deal of the story ad we can see that modern neuroscience has allowed us to go beyond simple dissociation. To see how there are always different state and the loss of flexibility of people to move through those different states, uhm, is absolutely critical. We've heard today, ah, and I think in a, in a very, ah, eclectic and, and wide ranging series, very interesting presentations about if you don't begin to understand how to modulate these primary systems, uhm, you-- we really, uhm, lost and disrupted to a degree. And I just like to finish with a little reflection on I think one of the most interesting moments, uhm, in, ah, in the movies that was es-- essentially played by Anon-- Alan Bennett that's called the Madness of King George. Now I know that Ling George III, ah, has a different reputation in this part of the world because, uhm, he was responsible for the American war of independence and his intimate (inaudible ) which, ah, is this play is about, was an important contributor. But there's an absolutely fabulous scene in those film. How many people have seen the Madness of King George? All right, look, I can thoroughly recommend it to you because it is ex-- it, it, it's a wonderful piece of theater. Now the point of which he recovers his sanity, he's sitting with his courtiers and what they're doing, uhm, is actually reading the play of King Liam and King George has the role of King Liam. And he, he's saying as Liam. He's says, "You do me wrong to take me out of the grave. Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears do scald like molten lead." Now isn't that a wonderful way of describing extreme-- the script and then he stops, puts down the script and he says, "Oh, it's so true." And then he looks around and he says, "Pray, do not mock me. I'm a very foolish, fond old man. And to deal plainly, I'm not in my perfect mind." So he was gaining that point of his sanity somehow by reflecting on the suffering, uhm, and the distress of, of King Liam in his own madness. And Thurlow who is the chancellor of ex-- Exchequers tends to him. He says to your majesty, "Your majesty seems more yourself." Okay, and what an interesting tale is I think to save somebody. And King George responds, he says, "Do I? Yes I do. I have always been myself even when I was ill. Only now I seem myself. And that's the important thing. I have remembered how to seem. What, what?" And you see, I think that's the fascinating thing is it is about our relationship with ourself and I think really what insanity and, and madness and mental illness and post traumatic stress disorder and complex PTSD is about is that dis-- disruption of our relationship with ourself. And, and it's fascinating, you know, when you wake up tomorrow morning how do you know it's you whose in bed? And, and, and when you, when you think about people with schizophrenia, uhm, one whole set of their delusions is about how their thoughts in their mind are not their own. They actually say, you know, somebody's putting their thoughts into my mind. My thoughts are being controlled by, by something outside of me. By machines, by computers, by aliens. And what they never say is, "Look, I noticed my whole internal capacity to observe myself to organize my thoughts. The field is being disrupted. I develop these strange systematized delusions to explain it and the tragedy of it is this, this destruction and the disruption of really what is the essence of humanity and that is about being able to feel, to see, to sense, to orientate. to be respectful, to organize, to think, uhm, to understand and, you know, I think what we've heard about so much today is about how trauma, ah, disrupts those skills and if we don't really take a very broad perspective of that, uhm, we really are failing our patients and I think, ah, it really has been a wonderful day to, to, to ha-- to have the presentations we had.
