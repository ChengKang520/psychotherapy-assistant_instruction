Leading Counseling Groups with Adults: 

00:00:10
A Demonstration Of The Art Of Engagement 

00:00:20
Led by:

Dr. Ed Jacobs 

00:00:20
Dr. Christine Schimmel 

00:00:25
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL This is Dr. Christine Schimmel. I, along with Dr. Ed Jacobs and one of the co-leaders of the group counseling experience you are about to view. We are very excited about this video, because it shows many of the skills and techniques that can be helpful to you when leading groups with adults. Dr. Ed Jacobs coordinates the masters program in counseling in West Virginia University, where he's been teaching group counseling for more than 40 years. Ed is a fellow in the Association for Specialists in Group Work. He's also the creator of Impact Therapy, an active, creative, multi-sensory, theory-driven approach to counseling. I coordinate the school counseling program at West Virginia University. I currently teach the doctoral course in advanced group counseling, as well as the group counseling course specifically geared for school counselors. I'm a former school counselor where I led groups in elementary, middle, and high schools. Ed and I have been presenting workshops together for than 20 years on group counseling and impact therapy. You will see us working well as co-leaders, because we have the same approach to counseling and group leading. And we have many years of working together. One thing to know with regards to co-leading is that we're sitting opposite each other and not side by side. We think that this is more effective, because when members are looking at one leader, the other leader can scan the group for group member reactions. In this video, we present our ideas from our three books, one on Impact Therapy and two, on group counseling. Our approach to group leading is based on the idea that people don't mind being led when they are led well. It is also predicated on the idea that group leading is about the art of engagement. You will see us being active and drawing members out, asking good questions, playing dramatic parts and facilitating deep conversations about guilt, self-confidence, worry, shoulds, relationships and self-worth. In this video, we show what we think are essential skills for group leaders. You will see the art of engagement through the use of asking many good thought provoking questions, and the use of rounds, props, chairs and a whiteboard. You will also see us see us using our voice to engage members more deeply, and you will see us use the essential skills of drawing out, cutting off, linking and holding, shifting and deepening the focus. A major portion of the video captures members working at a deep, personal level. We show how to work with one member while keeping the other members very engaged. We show many different skills and techniques that are useful in keeping all members engaged. We get members to share and comment, to ask questions and to actively participate in the work of a single working member. We also show the art of working a topic at a deep, interesting level, so that all members are engaged and benefiting. When working with a member or topic, we infuse theory into the conversation. We use ideas from Rational Emotive Behavior Theory, Adlerian therapy, Reality Therapy, Gestalt therapy and Transactional Analysis. You will see these theories applied in many different ways. Our belief is that in order to be effective in counseling or therapy groups, the leader needs to have good working knowledge of one or more theories. This video was filmed over a seven-hour period on a single day. The morning sessions consisted of six members, and the afternoon session had two additional members. Six of the eight members were former or current clients of Dr. Jacob's. Two members were not known to either of the leaders. Ed had a five-minute conversation with the two members he did not know in order to make sure they were appropriate for the group. Everyone volunteered for the experience. Since two members joined in the afternoon, you will get a chance to see how we integrate new members into the group. For the final copy of this group experience, the video was edited from nearly four hours down to approximately two and a half hours. Our goal was to show our approach to leading groups with adults. So we include segments where we as leaders are using various skills and techniques in the warm-up, working and closing phases. There will be times when we move the action forward due to the constraints on the DVD. When we do this, you will see a brief blank screen, so you will know that we've moved ahead. We show almost the entire warm-up phase, and we do show the entire closing phase. We show a number of different segments from the working phase of the group, where we work intensely with a person or a topic. It should be noted that for filming purposes, group members were sitting in a horseshoe instead of a circle. If we were not filming, we would be sitting in a circle. We hope you find watching this video to be informative, engaging and beneficial in helping you to become a better group leader. To further enhance the value of viewing this video, we have created a viewers guide and an instructor's guide. 

00:05:35
Introduction to Warm-up Phase 

00:05:35
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Every group has at least three phases. A warm-up phase, a middle or working phase, and a closing phase. In this group, the warm-up phase lasts approximately 14 minutes. In those 14 minutes, you will see many skills demonstrated. During the warm-up, the leaders try to get the members comfortable with being in a group. In this video, you will see the leaders using three activities to get members to share parts of their lives. Listed are the skills and techniques used by the leaders during the warm-up phase. 1. Use of a simple introduction of group leaders. 2. Use of a round where each member provides information about themselves. 3. Use of sentence completion to get members to share more and to discuss how the group will be conducted. 4. Making sure the warm-up is engaging and not boring. 5. Explaining the need for cutting off in order to go to other member or to move on to an activity. 6. Use of a picture to engage members and get them to share. 7. Making sure to not focus on one member for any length of time during the warm-up phase. 8. Drawing out. 9. Use of a serious, yet warm, inviting voice. 10. Explaining the purpose of the group. 

00:07:00
DR. ED JACOBS For coming on… I'm Ed Jacobs and that's Christine Schimmel, we are gonna be co-leading this. And if we can go around and let you introduce yourself, and just say a sentence or so of why you volunteered to do this, other than the… someone asking you to do it. Asra, you want to… 

00:07:20
ASRA So my name is Asra. And, I'm a mom to a 12-year-old and always trying to figure out how to live life better. 

00:07:30
MISTY My name is Misty and I have two children. And I'm here just for a personal growth, the walk through the door. 

00:07:40
EVY MCPHERSON I'm Evy McPherson. I'm a mother of four, umm… and I would have to agree I'm here for personal growth. It's the first time I've been in a group session, and I'm looking forward to it. 

00:07:50
IVY My name is Ivy and I'm here because you can never learn too much about yourself and others. 

00:08:00
RUTH I'm Ruth and I'm here for personal growth, as well. 

00:08:00
LESLIE I'm Leslie, and I'm here as well for personal growth. I have two children, two boys. Umm… I'm hoping to better myself from this. 

00:08:10
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Written exercises are valuable in groups because members feel more comfortable when the leader calls on them, that is, they have something to say. The members can read what they wrote. Also, written exercises are engaging. Members have to think in order to answer the questions and members are curious about what other members wrote. Some examples of written exercises are sentence completion, lists, fill in the blank, and ratings of one to ten. 

00:08:40
DR. ED JACOBS I think we're gonna start. We've got a sentence completion thing that… Just fill out the top for it. 

00:08:45
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL No, don't bother with the model. 

00:08:50
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, don't bother. And it's… it's about being in groups, and it will give us a chance. It will give us a chance… Let me get one. To talk about what this experience is gonna be. So just take a minute or so to fill this out. 

00:09:10
Sentence Completion Form 

00:09:10
1. When I enter a new group I feel________ 

00:09:10
2. When people first meet me they________ 

00:09:10
3. When I am in a new group I feel most comfortable when________ 

00:09:10
4. I feel annoyed when the leader________ 

00:09:10
5. In a new group I am most afraid of________ 

00:09:15
DR. ED JACOBS Did one of these stand out to you? Which sentence was either the hardest or easiest for you to answer? 

00:09:25
ASRA Probably when people first meet me. 

00:09:25
DR. ED JACOBS Go ahead. What did you put? 

00:09:30
ASRA All I wrote was, when people first meet me they wonder, dot, dot, dot. 

00:09:35
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. How about others? 

00:09:35
LESLIE Mine was the same one. When people first meet me, they love my personality. 

00:09:40
DR. ED JACOBS That's good. 

00:09:40
MISTY Mine was, umm… I'm most afraid of being vulnerable. 

00:09:45
DR. ED JACOBS Oh, being vulnerable in group? 

00:09:45
MISTY Yeah. 

00:09:50
DR. ED JACOBS Let's talk about that. Certainly, we hope to make this experience a… a very good experience, very safe. Nobody is gonna attack anybody, Chris and will make sure that doesn't happen. We… We want you to be vulnerable in the sense of sharing, but… you know, we hope that you will. 

00:10:10
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL We hope that you get comfortable enough where you feel like you can share pretty, you know, fairly deep, but still feel safe doing that. 

00:10:15
DR. ED JACOBS Evy, what's the term that stood out to you? 

00:10:20
EVY MCPHERSON Umm… Oh, gosh. When… When people first meet me, they think I'm friendly. Umm… 

00:10:30
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. I think we've got a good group as far as people. This just happened this way. I mean, as I was, sort of, recruiting members and then the makeup of this, I think. And I think the more that we get comfortable, and then we'll do some other stuff here in just a minute. What about… When the leador I feel annoyed if the leader does what? Go ahead. 

00:10:55
IVY That was the… That would be the most, umm… not difficult question, but the one that stood out the most for me, and so I said, "When I get singled out on an uncomfortable issue." 

00:11:05
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

00:11:05
IVY So, that would have been the most uncomfortable question. 

00:11:10
DR. ED JACOBS And… And we really won't ever push any of you to do anything you don't want to do. I mean, you can always say, "No, I don't want to go there." I hope you'll volunteer, you say there is something that I want to… that's on my mind, but I am… I don't think I'm ready to share it, and we're gonna do that. So, I think you… 'cause some group leaders push, and we really don't do that. What did others of you say for that one? Because we want to clarify, sort of, what we're doing. 

00:11:35
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Right. We want to avoid those behaviors. 

00:11:40
RUTH (inaudible ). 

00:11:41
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

00:11:41
ASRA So, you didn't know… I wrote, "I feel annoyed when the leader doesn't listen." Yeah. 

00:11:45
LESLIE Wow, we are so much alike. The same thing. 

00:11:50
ASRA Yeah. Okay, good. 

00:11:50
LESLIE Yeah. 

00:11:50
ASRA Yeah. 

00:11:50
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

00:11:55
MISTY I just put, "When the leader interrupts my train of thought." 

00:11:55
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

00:12:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Watch how the leader tells the members that they may at times interrupt a member. Being able to cutoff members is an essential skill for leading effective groups. It is helpful during the beginning stage of a group to alert members to the possibility that this may be necessary at times. 

00:12:15
DR. ED JACOBS There will be times where we might interrupt or cutoff, but if we do that, it's either because of time or we think that I can see other people's energy is going, or that it, you know, that might happen. But if it does, it's… it's never to offend you, and certainly check with us if you… We don't anybody to feel hurt by, but Chris' and my job is to pay attention to all six people. Your job is mainly to pay attention to you. I feel… what about, "I feel most comfortable when…" In a new group, I feel most comfortable… 

00:12:50
RUTH When I know at least one person. 

00:12:55
DR. ED JACOBS So that's why you brought Les? 

00:12:55
RUTH Again, I knew you too. 

00:13:00
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. How about others? 

00:13:00
LESLIE I put, "When I can laugh." 

00:13:05
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. But we've done that already. 

00:13:05
ASRA Yeah. 

00:13:05
DR. ED JACOBS Let's talk about number five for a minute, it will be something else and give a story. In a group, I'm most afraid of… You said being vulnerable. How about others? Evy? 

00:13:20
EVY MCPHERSON Revealing uncomfortable issues. 

00:13:25
DR. ED JACOBS And, we hope that you get comfortable enough to where you will reveal. That's the goal really. If we do our job, you will feel comfortable enough to do it, 'cause we could do this on the surface and talk, you know, nicely, sort of, but we can also do it where we go a little deeper, which I hope we'll do after we, sort of, warm-up. What did other people put? 

00:13:50
IVY For lack of putting something better, I just said, "Looking like an idiot." 

00:13:55
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

00:13:55
LESLIE I put "being judged." 

00:13:55
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

00:14:00
RUTH I put "not being accepted." 

00:14:00
DR. ED JACOBS How do you all feel about that? Are you all gonna be judgy? 

00:14:05
MISTY Nah. 

00:14:05
DR. ED JACOBS So, why are you looking like? What? 

00:14:10
ASRA Yeah. No, I just find it interesting, because it's obviously, you know, a theme here, yeah, of worrying about what other people think of you. So, obviously that's something we'll probably talk about. But, no, I think in this crowd it's a safe, safe space. 

00:14:30
DR. ED JACOBS Any other thoughts? And this is, sort of, to warm us up really. The camera… 

00:14:35
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL One thing I would say about that too is… most of you know… have worked with Ed or know our style. But we will do some sort of different kinds of creative things during the process of the group that might look… You might at first go, "I don't want to sit in that chair. I don't want to do that, because I don't want to look silly." But if we're… if we're encouraging you to do it, boy, it's never to make you look silly, it's because we really think it can help you work through that issue that you're struggling with. 

00:15:00
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, we're real committed to not trying to make anybody feel silly. And I think if this goes right, there will be a good connection of people pretty quick, and then we can get in some issues. We'll do another thing to just, sort of, warm-up and then after that we'll get started, and we've got… and some of you came wanting to talk about certain things. The picture, don't worry about the sex or the… the race of the kid, but which kid do you think represents you now, in where you are in your life? If you were gonna pick a kid, which kid would it be and why? 

00:15:50
Note how engaged the members are in looking at the picture. It helps to do engaging activities during the warm-up phase of the group. 

00:16:00
EVY MCPHERSON Holding on for dear life. 

00:16:00
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

00:16:00
LESLIE Yeah. 

00:16:05
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. Which… Which kid that… 

00:16:05
EVY MCPHERSON This one right here, holding on to the the limb… holding for dear life. 

00:16:10
DR. ED JACOBS Why do you say that, Evy? 

00:16:10
EVY MCPHERSON It is my current… current situation. Umm… And umm… 

00:16:15
DR. ED JACOBS Why don't you tell… 

00:16:15
EVY MCPHERSON Not knowing… just going through a… a nasty divorce, and… and… and infidelity and feeling betrayed, and… and money missing, and umm… life's uncertainties and… and such, umm… not knowing… 

00:16:35
DR. ED JACOBS So, it has you… 

00:16:35
EVY MCPHERSON It has me holding on for dear life. Just not sure if I'm gonna make it to the top. Not sure if I'm gonna fall backwards on my, you know, my… my bum or my, you know, on my face. I'm just, sort of, holding on right now and maintaining. 

00:16:45
DR. ED JACOBS And you've said that? 

00:16:50
LESLIE Mm-hmm… Dealing with… my husband who is an addict. Umm… I always keep thinking maybe it's gonna get better. 

00:17:05
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. And it's not. Or it hadn't got better? 

00:17:10
LESLIE It has, but it's not as bad as it was. Umm… 

00:17:10
DR. ED JACOBS How long… How long have you been married to him? 

00:17:15
LESLIE Six years. 

00:17:15
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

00:17:15
EVY MCPHERSON I did that for 22, thinking it would get better, until things finally just blew up in my face and… and reality was it's not getting any better. So… 

00:17:30
IVY I thought the little girl that's second highest, who's sitting on her little limb with a happy look at her face, just gliding through life. That's how I feel. 

00:17:35
UNKNOWN That's how I felt. 

00:17:35
DR. ED JACOBS That's good. Have you always felt that? 

00:17:40
IVY Oh, of course not. But, I… I do now in my life, but no, not always. 

00:17:45
EVY MCPHERSON Good, I want to be there. 

00:17:45
DR. ED JACOBS Misty? 

00:17:45
MISTY I'm the girl going up the rope swing. 

00:17:50
DR. ED JACOBS And why did you pick her? 

00:17:50
MISTY Umm… 'Cause she had to start at the bottom and, you know, she isn't to the… where she wants to be. But, you know, she's climbing the rope and, you know, eventually she will get… she will get there. 

00:18:05
DR. ED JACOBS Where… Where do you see yourself going? What do you… 

00:18:10
MISTY At this point I'm stuck on that… right where she is. 

00:18:15
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

00:18:15
MISTY I want to go. I want to be at the top of the tree. 

00:18:15
DR. ED JACOBS Do you know what it will take to get you? 

00:18:20
MISTY Confidence I think. 

00:18:25
DR. ED JACOBS Okay, we'll talk some about that. 

00:18:25
ASRA I think for me, I'm definitely little girl that's observing. I sort of connected to a few of them. I connected to her in some parts of my life, and then the little boy climbing up the, umm… limb of over on the… of the tree on the right side, and the little girl chilling out and hanging out, and then… So I'm all over, I am… 

00:18:45
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

00:18:45
ASRA But clearly that's also a metaphor, I think. 

00:18:50
DR. ED JACOBS That… right. 

00:18:50
ASRA Yeah and… 

00:18:50
DR. ED JACOBS It fits that I know you. 

00:18:50
ASRA Yeah, exactly. And then also, the one going from one limb to the next. So, yeah. I'm busy. 

00:19:00
RUTH I picked the one at the top of the ladder, 'cause I have climbed and I'm doing better, but I still have a ways to go. There are still things that I need to conquer. 

00:19:10
EVY MCPHERSON So, the one that's standing on the… 

00:19:15
RUTH The one that standing on the tree and holding on to the ladder. 

00:19:15
EVY MCPHERSON Okay, great. 

00:19:20
DR. ED JACOBS What… So, the goal of this group is to help you, maybe, if you want to do something else. Like, you're sort of content with where you're at. And then we'll see what we get into. And… And some of the topics, I think, are just what you just mentioned. Plus, there are topics like… I mean, we can look at your marriage. I think we can certainly do that. I think relationship's is a good topic. Parent relationships is a good topic. 

00:19:55
ASRA Stability with this… my relationship with myself. You know, I'm making sure that I just do the kind of things that I need, like, getting to bed on time, getting the exercise. You know, these kind of… 

00:20:10
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Self-care kinds of things. 

00:20:10
ASRA Self-care things, yeah, yeah. 

00:20:10
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, in… in… I think that feeling good about who you are. 

00:20:15
ASRA Yeah. 

00:20:20
DR. ED JACOBS 'Cause I saw, Evy, your head was nodding when she said that. So you want to say some more of that. 

00:20:25
EVY MCPHERSON You know I do. I think… I think in life we struggle with a lot of different things. You know, and the biggest thing is realizing we need… we need help, we need to talk with someone, we need to express our feelings and… the confidence, the self-confidence is… is huge in everyone's life, I think, in whatever stage you're in. Whether, you know, it's… it's abusive relationship, which I've been in for quite some time, and in a lot of different ways. You know, betrayal, the cheating, you know, that… I think that brings us down to a level. You know, if you're lacking self-confidence and you go through things like, that it just… it just sets you back and takes you further away from your goal, and that is to… to live a happy and healthy life. 

00:21:15

00:21:20
Working Phase Of Session 1 

00:21:20
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL In this segment, you will see the leaders using the art of engagement in many ways. The working phase is where members share at a deeper level, where members are engaged in working on themselves and are trying to help other members who are working on personal issues. In this initial working phase of the group, you will see many different leadership skills and techniques. 1. Asking good, deepening questions. 2. Use of rounds to engage members. 3. Use of voice to further engage the members. 4. Timing as to when to work with a member in pain. A member is tearing up, but the leaders felt it best to give her time to warm up to being in the group. 5. Drawing out members. 6. The use of eyes by leaders and members explained. 7. Holding and deepening the focus. 8. Shifting the focus. Not staying too long with one person. 9. Use of theories to take the session deeper. 10. Getting members to share as a way to help a working member. 11. Teaching concepts and ideas. 12. Cutting off members in order to focus in a more productive way. 13. Use of props and chairs in order to be engaging. The video picks up one minute after the warm-up phase ended. Evy shared about her situation and Asra commented. Ed starts with a good question to get members deeper into themselves. 

00:22:50
DR. ED JACOBS Think about this and we'll go around and get everybody to comment. On a 1 to 10 scale, 10 is "I feel very confident about who I am." And one is, "I don't feel confident at all about who I am." And try to be honest with that. What would you give that as far as how confident do you feel? Because I know some of you are working on this and… What would you give? 

00:23:20
LESLIE I think, two. 

00:23:20
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

00:23:25
RUTH I think when I started seeing you, I was at a two, but I feel like I'm about at a seven now. I'm really confident in myself. I've still have a long way to go with issues in my life, but I… I've done really good things in my life. 

00:23:40
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, 'cause I know just stopping drinking and the whole thing with men has been a good thing. How about for you? 

00:23:45
IVY I'd like to say 10, but I'll say nine. 

00:23:45
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

00:23:50
EVY MCPHERSON I would say a two when I started with Ed. And I'm progressing. I… I might be at a four right now. You know, I… I think the lack of self-confidence allows people to control you and mistreat you. So, you have to have that confidence after all. 

00:24:10
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. If you don't respect yourself, you will be mistreated. And I know that was true for you, Misty. That was true for you. And it sounds like that's an issue for you. When you're ready we'll help you, I promise. 

00:24:25
MISTY Well, when I started with Ed, I was probably a one, if not a zero. So, I'd have to say, I'm a six, a five or six… 

00:24:35
DR. ED JACOBS Well, can I share? I mean, just like you… you were afraid to walk into a store. 

00:24:40
MISTY Yeah. Like, I didn't have confidence. 

00:24:40
DR. ED JACOBS She didn't think she was worthy to go to… 

00:24:45
MISTY Like, yeah, Elder-Beerman or Neiman Marcus or… Yeah, I would just, like, just walk on by and… I wouldn't even go into the mall without, you know… 

00:24:50
DR. ED JACOBS Because you just thought you didn't deserve it or something, right? 

00:24:55
MISTY Yeah. Pretty much. 

00:24:55
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

00:25:00
ASRA I'd say, probably like I'm high on confidence, eight or nine, but there's this distinction in terms of self-care though. Like, I don't have… so I… I… I will say if it came to confidence about taking good care of myself, it's probably like a three or four. So, I don't know if you can… 

00:25:20
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I'm sort of hearing that that is like… you interpret that… to make it Like, if you took the confidence level to a level where you could care for yourself, that would somehow be selfish. 

00:25:30
ASRA Yeah, that might be one way of putting it. Selfish or… I think it's just… it's really about the skills, you know, just about really, literally understanding this is what a person needs. And… And it's… And it could be selfish. It could be just confusion about what… what is good health, healthy living for self. 

00:26:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL And then what crosses over into… 

00:26:00
ASRA Yeah. 

00:26:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I don't know, narcissism or… 

00:26:05
ASRA Right. 

00:26:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL …selfishness or something. 

00:26:05
ASRA Right. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:26:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Okay. 

00:26:10
DR. ED JACOBS If something you will notice that when people are talking, and even if you're talking to us, we might look away to get you to look at everybody, or when someone's talking we'll glance around, because our job is to pick up on, you know, people's nonverbal behavior and stuff. So, it's not that we are not listening to you. It's just… That That's a group leadership skill really. It seems like this is a good topic, the whole confidence. Of… What… What do you need to do if you maid… took one step further towards greater confidence? What could you do here in this group even? What could you talk about? What do you think you have questions about? What… What would… What could be helpful? Evy, what do you think would be helpful for you? 

00:27:10
EVY MCPHERSON Oh, gosh. Umm… To keep telling me that… that, umm… I… I you know, I… things are gonna work out, it's gonna be okay and, you know, I'm gonna get there. And, you know, patience and taking time, umm… that I'm… I'm not a bad person. I think sometimes people would beat you down to make you feel like you're a bad person. You know, to add to what you were saying, I would… you know, I'm a giver. And, it's really hard for me to do things for myself, because I'm such a giver. I put everyone else first. And you were talking about making time for yourself. I don't do that either. But it's because I'm I worry about making sure everybody else has what they need first, and then I just… you know, I just, sort of, just fall on the bed and go sleep at the end of the day. 

00:28:00
ASRA Right. 

00:28:00
EVY MCPHERSON So balancing, I think balancing that, you know… 

00:28:05
DR. ED JACOBS Can you put yourself first? Can you put yourself first? 

00:28:05
LESLIE No. 

00:28:10
DR. ED JACOBS Not at all? 

00:28:10
RUTH I have been… 

00:28:10
LESLIE It's hard, it's hard. 

00:28:10
DR. ED JACOBS Lately? 

00:28:10
RUTH Yes. I have been lately… 

00:28:10
DR. ED JACOBS But that's a change. 

00:28:15
RUTH That's a change because… 

00:28:15
DR. ED JACOBS Tell… Tell us. 

00:28:15
RUTH I felt when I first started seeing you, I felt like I was being selfish if I looked out for myself. And if I did things that, you know, I don't know, like, if I put myself above my daughter, I was a bad person. She's 21 and she has special needs. And, she's the cause of a lot of my anguish and… and I have just my… When I was in my mid 20s, I became coke addict. And I wasn't the best mother. And I started, I think… When I… When I recovered, I just did everything for her. And I've bent over backwards to make her happy. You known At some point, that became a negative thing, because she expects so much now. And lately, I've realized that I've got to be happy too. If I'm not happy, nobody is gonna be happy. And I'm looking now for me more because other people don't, you have to look out for yourself. 

00:29:10
DR. ED JACOBS But helping you believe in yourself. Misty, you look… What are you thinking is there…? 

00:29:15
MISTY Nothing, I'm just like listening and… it's sort of like… I guess, like, Ruth said, she ever did… to basically redeem herself in her daughter's eyes. And I do that in with my son a lot. You know, just co-signed for a new Harley for him. You know, he works part-time at Home Depot and I'm, like, stressed out every month about him making the payment. And, you know, just because I felt at one time I was a bad mother. His dad's gone to prison, has been to prison, got out and he's going back. So, I just felt like I need to, you know, that makes me a good mom if I do everything. But in reality, it's just making them… 

00:30:05
RUTH More dependent and… 

00:30:05
MISTY Yeah, more dependent and just wanting, you know, not… but to rely on me and… you know, I can hardly rely on myself, let alone have someone else do it. But, you know… and it's a confidence booster. When your kids want something from you, it makes you, you know… And… 

00:30:25
DR. ED JACOBS (inaudible ) it doesn't create stress and resentment. 

00:30:26
MISTY Right. 

00:30:26
DR. ED JACOBS Which is… I think I know that three of you have that situation going on where you do this stuff and then you resent it and, "How much do I give to my son or daughter?" Whatever… 

00:30:40
EVY MCPHERSON It's a guilt thing. I think we feel guilty because there are situations where, you know, the other parent is not doing their part. We feel the guilt, and we feel like we need to do our part plus their part. So we over-compensate sometimes and, you know… And you as well, I mean, I… you know, whether it would be an absent parent or whatever. You know, that that parent is not there, so you over… you overdo to try to, you know, fix the… the gap in your child's life. 

00:31:15
RUTH I had her when I was 18, her father has never been in the picture. So I raised her on my own. And it's hard with her because she's 21, but mentally, she's about 13 or 14. And, like, I am to the point I want her to move, because we don't have a good relationship and we don't… It doesn't even feel like a parent-child relationship. Like, Ed told me about emotional incest and I thought it was so creepy when he said it. But we've been together for so long that it is like we're in a relationship together. And I expect her to listen to me, but really, I'm her parent and she shouldn't, you know. But it's just that it's not a healthy relationship for us. We're just stuck together and we don't want to be there. But at the same time, I struggle with putting her out on her own, because mentally she is 13 or 14. And it scares me of what decisions she will make for herself. And… It's just my job to worry and to hover over her. 

00:32:20
DR. ED JACOBS Let's… if it's okay, we'll just spend a few minutes you talking about that in… in trying to help Ruth figure this out, because I know she's struggling with that. 

00:32:30
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL And Ruth thinking too, what… how the group could help you with that. 

00:32:35
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, what… what… How could the group help you? 

00:32:35
RUTH Well, I think making me not feel as bad about myself as I do, because I resent her. I love her. I love her to pieces, I would die for her. But at the same time I resent her, because it's been my whole life. I mean, I was a mother before I went on my first date, you know. I mean, I've just… this is what I've always done, and it's been hard with her… with her special needs. 

00:32:55
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

00:33:00
EVY MCPHERSON I might be able to help you a little bit with this, Ruth, because I have a niece, umm… same situation, special needs and such. And she's… and my sister just recently passed away, and my sister didn't put things in place for her to be taken care of. So, she's now homeless. She out on the street and, you know, I feel guilty, but I'm not in a place to help her. We have to… as parents, we have to put in place, and I now realize how my sister failed with that. So, if you do anything for your child, you need to do something, a guardianship or something. There… There are homes that they can go into that are… 

00:33:40
DR. ED JACOBS Well, yeah, she's got some of that stuff, but it's more the mental part. 

00:33:45
EVY MCPHERSON Right. 

00:33:45
DR. ED JACOBS Let… Let… For all of you that have children and issues about that. You know, how you love and… but yours, because you are on the verge of really, literally having her live away from you. And you're not sure if that's the right thing to do or… 

00:34:05
RUTH You know, in the days we really fight it's like, "Oh, I can't wait till you're gone," but… but then there are days that, like, she just does something so childish, and it's like, "There's no way that I can put you out there and even sleep at night feeling like you're gonna be okay." 

00:34:20
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Just… Just to clarify the… the situation that she would be leaving you to go to, is that… So you feel pretty good about that situation? 

00:34:25
RUTH I'm just… I don't know. 

00:34:30
DR. ED JACOBS It's an independent living… 

00:34:30
RUTH It's an independent living facility. And I can get people that come in and out and check on her, but it's just… 

00:34:35
IVY I think that's sounds like a great idea. 

00:34:35
EVY MCPHERSON I do too. I think she needs that and so do you. 

00:34:40
IVY I had children really young, too. I had my first one at 17 and then another one at 19. I have two sons and a daughter. And my daughter, I love her very much but she's so much better not living with me. We fight… And I'm a giver too, and I think a lot of women are. And I found that I raised three takers except… I mean, I created them. And you can just allow yourself so much. I mean, my kids are all in their 30s, so I've been on these places and now I'm, like, I've had enough. And so now, I created all the, uh… negativity that they sent my way, I mean, I feel like a lot of it was my fault. But now I've had to say, "Okay, you know, you got to have time for you." 

00:35:20
DR. ED JACOBS So, you don't think it's wrong for her to do that? 

00:35:20
IVY I think it's the best thing you can possibly do for yourself and her. 

00:35:25
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yeah, I'm curious. Did you feel that way at the beginning though? Like when you… 

00:35:30
IVY I didn't have a special needs daughter, so… 

00:35:35
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL But in the beginning, did you think, "Oh, what am I doing, cutting the cord…?" 

00:35:40
IVY No. I mean, I drove for to New York City where she was gonna go to college, and I was like so happy. I actually… 

00:35:45
LESLIE Get out. 

00:35:45
IVY I was, like… I kind of cried on the way home a little while, and then that was gone. I was, like, "Yes!" I actually felt, like, a relief. 

00:35:50
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Watch how the leader asks questions of one member to help the working member. Often, a leader works with some members knowing that it is helpful to other members. Members working on issues often gain a great deal from hearing from other members talk about how they dealt with similar issues. How do you think you got there though? How do you… I mean, what did you do…? 

00:36:10
DR. ED JACOBS In your head… 

00:36:10
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL In your head that got you… 

00:36:10
IVY But now after that I also had moments where she would just make me feel horrible and… and use me and abuse me. And that's just a relationship unfortunately. Umm… I really feel like, and I've heard other people say this, you have to take care of yourself if you're gonna give anything else. If you deplete everything you have, you have nothing left to give. So, it's really better to take care of yourself so you can give. 

00:36:35
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. Misty, you said the same thing. 

00:36:40
MISTY Yeah, I think, umm… my… my son is the one that cut the apron strings not me. He just, you know, just said, "I'm 23…" you know… He doesn't ask for anything, and it bothers me. 

00:36:50
DR. ED JACOBS Other than the Harley? 

00:36:55
MISTY Yeah, then the Harley, yeah. And, umm… 

00:36:55
EVY MCPHERSON They will contact you when they need something. 

00:36:55
MISTY Yeah, when the payments need to be made. But actually… and I can tell I did more damage to him, just given, given, given. 

00:37:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Watch how the leader gently cuts off a member and then refocuses on a working member. The leader then uses theory in the group. The leader is using REBT, a cognitive behavioral theory that focuses on helping clients dispute their negative or irrational thoughts. To be a good therapy group leader, a leader should be able to use one or more counseling theories. Throughout this video, you will see the leaders use principles from Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, Transactional Analysis, Adlerian Therapy and Gestalt Therapy. 

00:37:35
MISTY Than I, you know, now he's… 

00:37:40
DR. ED JACOBS So, would Ruth be a bad mother if… I think what you were asking, Chris, you are not just throwing her own on the street, really. 

00:37:45
MISTY Right. 

00:37:45
LESLIE Right. 

00:37:50
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. Would she be a bad mother? Do you think she would be? 

00:37:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL To send her… To send her daughter to independent living? 

00:37:55
UNKNOWN No. 

00:37:55
EVY MCPHERSON You are teaching her to take care of herself by herself, and she's not dependent you anymore. 

00:38:00
DR. ED JACOBS And does she have a right to have a life? 

00:38:00
IVY Yes. 

00:38:00
EVY MCPHERSON Absolutely. 

00:38:05
DR. ED JACOBS Is this helpful, or what… what do you want to say or what do you want to ask the group? 

00:38:10
RUTH No, I… I think I just… I always expected that she was going to live with me forever. Whenever she was young, you know, they told me that… that she… that she was going to be the way that she was. And I think when she was younger and as she grew up, I thought she's just gonna be with me forever. But then, the last few years I thought, "Oh, no, forever's got to stop right here," like, you know, it is the more I learn to love myself, the more I realize that I don't want to do this forever, because I will be just existing like I have been. 

00:38:40
DR. ED JACOBS So, if you did it and she did move, you know, and it's, sort of, like, when you're driving home or whatever. What are you afraid you're gonna tell yourself? 

00:38:55
RUTH "I'm a horrible mom. I'm a bad person." 

00:38:55
DR. ED JACOBS What should she tell her herself? What do you think is the better thing to tell herself? 

00:39:00
IVY This is great for both of you and your relationship might be better. 

00:39:00
MISTY Yeah. 

00:39:05
RUTH And I… And I think it will be. 

00:39:05
DR. ED JACOBS And it's not like you're sending her to an independent living place in Florida. 

00:39:10
EVY MCPHERSON There's some… There's someone that will… that will… 

00:39:10
DR. ED JACOBS I mean, it's right here in Morgantown, right? 

00:39:15
RUTH Yeah, it'll be, like, two miles… 

00:39:15
MISTY And as long as you continue to, like, personally grow, then you can mentor her to, you know, be that… That's what I think. 

00:39:25
DR. ED JACOBS So you honestly do not think she's a bad woman? 

00:39:25
EVY MCPHERSON No. 

00:39:25
MISTY No, of course no. 

00:39:30
EVY MCPHERSON This is what she needs. This is what you need and this is what your daughter needs. She needs it. You know, he's got a… You know, things that are going on, he doesn't want to believe his father did, you know, committed adultery or was, you know, was… was cheating. And I think this is something he has to work through. And so I'm sitting… you know, I'm sitting back, trying to be normal and… and being fired at, so to speak, you know, with the shots that he's giving me and still trying to be there if he needs me. And I'm hoping that at some point he will get it. You know, he's still young and he will understand that mom's not the bad guy here. You know, that, you know, she was kind of… 

00:40:10
DR. ED JACOBS Well, just hanging in there. 

00:40:10
EVY MCPHERSON Yeah. 

00:40:10
DR. ED JACOBS I know that's the big… 

00:40:10
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL If I could take just a second… 

00:40:15
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, go ahead. 

00:40:15
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL And teach a little something, Evy, that might help you and maybe even Ruth as well. You know, when we say… we talk about children, we typically think a child, nine or ten, but the truth of the matter is that 19, your son is still at… He's still an adolescent, right? Even though he's in college and not, you know, supposed to be… you know, he's supposed to… We have all these expectations for them once they go to college. But just because they go to college, doesn't mean that all of a sudden their brains mature and they are adults, right. So, umm… when you… when you think about why children misbehave, there's usually four primary reasons why they misbehave. And one of those reasons… All that misbehavior has a purpose. And one of those misbehaviors can usually be driven by the idea that he's seeking revenge. And so when kids or children seek revenge, it's usually because they are hurting. And I teach this to teachers, and teachers… classroom teachers will say this is so helpful to learn because I'll say, look, when they are hurting, all the child knows is they want somebody else to hurt as much as they are hurting, right. "I want you to hurt like I'm hurting." And if you could flip that… maybe this is helpful, maybe… and I'm interested in what others of you think. But if you can flip it around in your head to understand that he feels safe enough to throw that at you because, he knows you're not going anywhere. 

00:41:40
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

00:41:40
EVY MCPHERSON I'll always gonna love him. 

00:41:40
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yeah. And I wonder if he doesn't feel safe enough throwing that at dad, because, "I don't know if dad would tolerate it," right? "I don't know if dad would really absorb that behavior." 

00:41:55
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, he will just cut him off or something. 

00:41:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yeah, yeah. "You big jerk, I don't want anything to…" you know. But he knows you're safe enough to do that with… 

00:42:00
EVY MCPHERSON Right. 

00:42:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL …and still be around. I mean, if you can flip… maybe flip that switch in your head a little bit to say, "Wow, what a privilege," if you will, you know, that this kid… Yeah, that this kid… 

00:42:15
DR. ED JACOBS To put up with… 

00:42:15
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yeah, that this kid knows my love is so unconditional that he will throw all this garbage at me and know that I'll absorb… I'll reject it, you know, and still have… 

00:42:25
DR. ED JACOBS Or absorb it… 

00:42:30
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Absorb it, and still have him over for Sunday dinner. 

00:42:30
DR. ED JACOBS And even though… if he didn't come, it's okay to… Misty, this is something… 

00:42:35
MISTY Oh, yeah, my son came to my job and we got into a fist fight out in the parking lot. And I mean, a major fist fight, cops were there and the whole… and I had him arrested. And… umm… 

00:42:50
DR. ED JACOBS It was… That was about a year or two ago. 

00:42:50
MISTY Yeah. 

00:42:55
DR. ED JACOBS Would you like help with that? 

00:42:55
LESLIE Yes. 

00:43:00
DR. ED JACOBS What help would… what would help look like with that? I mean, how could the group help you with that? 

00:43:10
LESLIE Teach me that I'm not a doormat. 

00:43:10
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

00:43:15
LESLIE I don't… like I said, I don't have that, I'll shoot that my kids. 

00:43:15
DR. ED JACOBS But you feel that way with him. 

00:43:20
EVY MCPHERSON And that's something I think Chris and Ed… the lack of self-confidence I've had. I've watched myself. I've had no confidence. I've had it. I've not had it. I've, you know… and I think we allow people to mistreat us. When we… When we're in our low point and… 

00:43:35
RUTH I think there are really certain people. For me, most people don't ever get to… to that place, whatever it is inside of me that will… I will be stupid and be your doormat. But there have been certain people in my life that have just affected me and… 

00:43:55
EVY MCPHERSON And struggling with fear. You know, a lot of the reason why I stayed and… you know, I didn't want my children to have, you know, to not have both of their parents. But also, the fear of being out on my own and how am I gonna make this work might be another reason why we allow people to treat us that way. And that was my situation for 22 years. So… 

00:44:20
DR. ED JACOBS I think we'll work on that may be after the break. What we'll do is take a break here for few minutes, just about five or 10 minutes. But let me pick up on that and we'll come… I want each of you to think about this question. When you grew up, what… If you had to say the message that you got growing up about yourself, like, "You're a wonderful person." "You're a piece of shit." "You matter." "You don't matter." What was the message, if you would put it in a sentence or two, because I think it's important that we connect that… Why don't we get one of the little girl… one of the little seat… chair, and then we'll be up. And this literally is just… When you were a little girl, what message do you think was sent to you by your parents? 

00:45:20
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Or whoever raised you. 

00:45:20
DR. ED JACOBS Or whoever raised you. Ruth, what was it? 

00:45:25
RUTH Umm… "You can't ever do things right." 

00:45:30
DR. ED JACOBS You can't do things right? 

00:45:35
RUTH Sex is the answer for everything. 

00:45:35
DR. ED JACOBS And that's what you were taught? 

00:45:35
RUTH That's what I was taught, yes. It's the… 

00:45:40
DR. ED JACOBS By your mom? 

00:45:40
RUTH My dad, my dad. 

00:45:40
DR. ED JACOBS Okay, okay. 

00:45:45
RUTH My mom was there, but she wasn't there. She was just absent. Like, I lived with her, but she… 

00:45:55
DR. ED JACOBS But you didn't grow up thinking, "I'm a good person?" 

00:45:55
RUTH No, I didn't. 

00:46:00
DR. ED JACOBS That wasn't the message that you were given? 

00:46:00
RUTH The only positive thing I took from my childhood was to make sure when I got older that I could take care of myself. And that has actually been the blessing, because I've always taken care of myself. 

00:46:15
IVY That is good. 

00:46:15
DR. ED JACOBS Ivy, what about… what did you come out of childhood? 

00:46:20
IVY Gosh, mine's kind of confusing. Umm… I think I was very loved by my mom, but she was dysfunctional in her life, she didn't… It was just really confusing. 

00:46:30
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

00:46:30
IVY Yeah, very confusing. 

00:46:30
DR. ED JACOBS So, it was just a confusing message is what you're saying? 

00:46:30
IVY Yeah. 

00:46:30
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

00:46:30
IVY Very. 

00:46:35
EVY MCPHERSON Umm… From my mother, I got a message "You'll never amount to anything." Someone that that drank a lot and… and struggled in her own life, and that's the message she's sent to me. And then I lived with my grandmother, and she gave me more positive feedback that I think has made me realize that I can do anything that I set my mind to. And that gave me the drive that I needed to try to succeed in life. 

00:47:05
DR. ED JACOBS But also then that you were set up from your mom… 

00:47:05
EVY MCPHERSON Yes. 

00:47:05
DR. ED JACOBS To try to please and never could do it, and you did that in your marriage? 

00:47:10
EVY MCPHERSON Exactly. 

00:47:10
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, and two marriages. 

00:47:15
DR. ED JACOBS Two. Yeah, both. 

00:47:15
DR. ED JACOBS Misty, what did you grow with? 

00:47:15
MISTY I was a piece of shit and just… 

00:47:20
DR. ED JACOBS That's what you believe? 

00:47:20
MISTY Oh, yeah, till about five years ago, probably. 

00:47:25
DR. ED JACOBS But that's what… How did your parents teach you that, that you didn't meant? 

00:47:30
MISTY Because they just didn't teach me anything. My dad was a guidance counselor, you know, he was busy saving everyone else's kids, but his own. And then my mom just, you know, had to put up with his infidelity and his crap. And then she just, you know, she's basically a beauty queen, and she was just so… 

00:47:50
DR. ED JACOBS But didn't you have to learn… didn't you learn makeup and stuff from somebody else or so? 

00:47:55
MISTY Yeah. Like, my mom's a professional makeup artist and everything and, you know, and I had to learn from someone else how to do everything. And, you know, she never… You know, she did what she knew… you know. 

00:48:05
DR. ED JACOBS But you grew up not with any message that you should have amount yourself with. 

00:48:10
MISTY Nothing. No boundaries. I was just, you know, basically… You know, we grew up… we had to have manner no matter what. So, I did grow up with manners, but other than that, it was just… 

00:48:25
DR. ED JACOBS But that's what… where you're groomed almost to be that doormat… 

00:48:25
MISTY Yeah. 

00:48:25
DR. ED JACOBS …is what… Asra, how about yours? 

00:48:30
ASRA Umm… Probably, "You're a good girl." And… And, "Do good for others." And so I think the two become, you know, dynamics and… in the conflict as an adult then of… of, you know, wanting to do for others, and so then you don't do for yourself. 

00:48:50
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL For yourself… Yeah. 

00:48:50
ASRA Yeah. And, you know, it's really interesting for me with a younger son to hear your own stories as mothers and just understanding that doing good for them doesn't mean comprising doing good for yourself because there was a hurt inside of you and also inside all of us that we have to take care of also. 

00:49:15
DR. ED JACOBS How about for you? What did you grow up… What was the message you were sent? 

00:49:20
LESLIE "You're not wanted." 

00:49:20
DR. ED JACOBS You're not wanted? Okay. That's why you get yourself in those situations, if you had that message. And this guy, Horrible Hendrix says if you… What didn't get completed in childhood, you will get into a relationship where you don't feel wanted and then you work your ass off to try to. You… You replicate what happened in childhood, unless you get aware of it. And you say, "I'm not gonna do that again." I know you've been… You and I've had talks about picking different… a whole different way of picking a man really. And you and I've talked some about that. 

00:50:05
EVY MCPHERSON I'm not ready for that yet. 

00:50:05
DR. ED JACOBS No, no. 

00:50:05
RUTH (inaudible ). 

00:50:10
DR. ED JACOBS There's a lot of people that… 

00:50:10
EVY MCPHERSON Thanks, but no thanks. 

00:50:10
DR. ED JACOBS But if you get healthy… Pull up the… a regular chair. And then we'll… we'll do this for about five minutes, and then we'll summarize this morning, I mean, this hour and a half. And then we'll take a break. 

00:50:30
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL The use of the two chairs comes from the theory of Transactional Analysis. TA is built upon the concept that each person has three ego states, the parent, the adult and the child. Throughout the rest of the video, watch how the leaders talk about the child and adult ego states, often using two chairs. 

00:50:50
DR. ED JACOBS That chair is here and now, this one represents past. If you can get to that chair, then… then… then you're… it's… it's a whole different thing. It means it's a whole different life where you feel… And I know, Misty, you've worked hard to get somewhat… I mean, you are in that seat. 

00:51:10
MISTY I'm doing better in this seat. 

00:51:10
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

00:51:10
MISTY Like, I catch myself doing it on my way to work. 

00:51:15
DR. ED JACOBS Doing what? 

00:51:15
MISTY Be driving in the adult chair and then… 

00:51:20
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Sliding? 

00:51:20
MISTY Well, yeah, and then, like, talking to the girl. And then talking, you know, to the little girl on the passenger seat of the car. Yeah, and because… you know, I mean, I work at 4 o'clock in the morning, so nobody sees me talking to myself. 

00:51:35
EVY MCPHERSON That's good. That's good. 

00:51:35
MISTY Yeah. 

00:51:35
EVY MCPHERSON That's a good way, I mean… 

00:51:35
MISTY So, that's just how I do it. And because I know, like, I'm gonna have maybe a little confrontation at work or something, and… or with my son or my ex-husband. So I have to, like, basically man up and… 

00:51:50
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Coach yourself up. 

00:51:50
MISTY Yeah, I coach myself. Be aware what I'm gonna say, and how I'm gonna say, and what tone I'm gonna use. So, you know… and what questions I have as, you know, "Don't be that scared little girl while you're doing it, be the adult." 

00:52:05
DR. ED JACOBS But our goal in this group experience, you know, we all said, sort of, personal growth is to help to be aware of that little girl part of you that still might be operating. And then, you know, and then… and… and then if you get to that seat, the adult you think… and just like you're more in you adult about what to do with Nikki. Whereas before, it was a rule, "I have to do this because I owe it to her," or whatever. Umm… 

00:52:35
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I'm curious of… Just to come back around and, Leslie, we can work more with you. But did… did you understand that piece of what he was saying about that message you got from childhood? Did you all understand that? How then you work to finish that? Okay. Was that helpful just for you to hear that? Because I… I wonder if that's kind of what you are doing with your husband. Like, you got that message, "You're not wanted." "So I'm gonna work to make sure he will… I'll put up with a lot to get him to want me," you know. 

00:53:10
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

00:53:10
EVY MCPHERSON And it's staying in that chair is the hard part. I didn't realize it until I started going to Ed. It's like, you know, there are times I'm there and then I get here, but it's maintaining and staying there and not sliding back in that little chair. 

00:53:25
DR. ED JACOBS That's why we bring the bungee cord. 

00:53:25
EVY MCPHERSON Yeah. 

00:53:30
DR. ED JACOBS To get you to strap yourself in. 

00:53:30
EVY MCPHERSON So, I'm like… I'm like you are. I'm fighting. I'm fighting it every day. 

00:53:35
MISTY It is, it's a fight. 

00:53:35
EVY MCPHERSON In all phases of life. I mean, it's like staying there, being in a control and being in that big chair and not losing that confidence and sliding back. 

00:53:45
RUTH But do you know those props really help. 

00:53:45
EVY MCPHERSON They do. 

00:53:45
RUTH Because there are times I will start fighting with Nikki and I say I'm so childish. And I'll be like, "Oh, god, I'm in the little chair," and I just walk away, you know. And before, I didn't have anything to think about, and now it's like… "I just sound ridiculous. I'm a grown woman." You know, and… and I'll just walk away from it. 

00:54:05
EVY MCPHERSON But I'm now feeling… I know this lack of self-confidence I get from time to time allows people to take advantage and mistreat me. I now know that that's my… that's my biggest thing that I have to fight. 

00:54:20
DR. ED JACOBS And it's overcoming some childhood messages that… Because if you were given a different message, you know, growing up, like you're wonderful, blah, blah, blah, then you wouldn't put up with crap. You just wouldn't do it. 

00:54:30
ASRA I don't know if this would be helpful to you all, but I know I resonate with what you said when you are talking about how her son is hurting, right, when he gets angry. And I know for myself what I've… And thinking about the big girl and the little girl chairs, tried to also connect to the little girl in the tree, you know, who's falling, that's in all of us. And giving ourselves the healing that we need, because I think the bungee cord sometimes to me is connecting those two chairs together. And that is, like… the little girl is within all of us, right. Like, battling her… like, fighting… It's better to embrace her, I think, and care for her. 

00:55:15
DR. ED JACOBS Yes. Some people do it like this even. You can have her with you… 

00:55:20
ASRA Right. 

00:55:20
DR. ED JACOBS But put it like this instead of just get rid of it. 

00:55:25
ASRA Being loving to her. 

00:55:25
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yeah. I might even say it a little differently than that. More so like this. Like. 

00:55:35
ASRA Yeah. 

00:55:35
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL It's okay. I don't have to listen, but it's okay. 

00:55:40
ASRA Yeah and there's a hurt within me that I need to take care of. Because I think, you know, when you were talking about your story, there was a hurt inside of you when you had… 

00:55:55
Working Phase Session 2 

00:55:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL This session follows a 15-minute morning break. The leaders start by focusing on Leslie, the member who they said they would work with after the break. The video picks up after Leslie has been talking for a minute or so describing more details of her relationship. Watch how the leaders try to help Leslie in many different ways, and how they engage the members in many different ways. Whenever leaders can take the work to a deeper, more personal level, most or all of the other members go to a deeper level within themselves. In this session, you will see the leaders use the following skills and techniques. 1. Use of rounds to engage members. 2. Use of voice to further engage the members. 3. Drawing out members. 4. Holding and deepening the focus. 5. Shifting the focus, not staying too long with one person. 6. Asking good, deepening questions. 7. Use of theories to take the session deeper. 8. Getting members to share as a way to help a working member. 9. Teaching concepts and ideas. 10. Cutting off members in order to focus in more productive ways. 11. Use of props and chairs in order to be engaging. 12. Use of repeated questions by members to deepen the focus. 13. Use of members to dramatize the working member's internal dialogue. 

00:57:35
LESLIE Now it is… He's going to pick up friends' habits. I used to find bottles of piss laying around where he would take… and piss in the bottle and be able to use that as a piss test when he want to get methadone, because if you have positive for anything in your system, they will not give you your methadone. So, he found that smoking synthetic pot, they don't test for that. 

00:58:05
DR. ED JACOBS So, what you're saying is, "It is difficult for me living with an addict," which it's difficult with any others living with an addict. And that's what your pain is about, because he's not… 

00:58:15
LESLIE And trust. 

00:58:15
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, sure trust that it's not gonna get worse. 

00:58:20
LESLIE Mm-hmm. 

00:58:20
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. And then when he sneaking piss and playing games with the methadone… 

00:58:25
LESLIE Yeah. 

00:58:25
DR. ED JACOBS With your… Here is… Here is what I want us to do. And, Ivy, I'm gonna have you just ask her. "How can we help?" And then she… you will try to answer in a short sentence. Misty's is gonna ask you the exact same thing. "How can we help?" Then Evy… And it's just trying to get you deeper into what you really want help with. 

00:58:50
IVY How can we help you with your feelings on this? 

00:58:55
LESLIE Help me you learn to trust him. 

00:58:55
MISTY How can we help you? 

00:59:00
LESLIE Help me be stronger. 

00:59:05
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. I'm gonna go back just to this one. I don't know that we… Me sitting here, I don't know that I trust him either. 

00:59:10
IVY I don't either. 

00:59:10
DR. ED JACOBS You know, I don't because of if… An addict can't be trusted. 

00:59:15
LESLIE Right. 

00:59:15
DR. ED JACOBS So what did you… What did you say to her? "Help me be stronger?" Ask her this, "How can we help?" 

00:59:20
EVY MCPHERSON How can we help you? 

00:59:25
LESLIE Be my support system. 

00:59:30
RUTH How can we help you? 

00:59:35
LESLIE Listen to me. 

00:59:35
DR. ED JACOBS We can do that, sure. 

00:59:35
EVY MCPHERSON We can do this. 

00:59:40
ASRA Umm… just… Can I just ask a little bit differently which is just how can we help the little girl within you? 

00:59:50
[sil.] 

00:59:55
LESLIE Help me not be scared. 

00:59:55
ASRA Okay. 

01:00:00
DR. ED JACOBS Say some more of what you're scared about. 

01:00:00
LESLIE I'm afraid to be alone. 

01:00:05
DR. ED JACOBS And you are afraid that the addiction is gonna not get better, or even get worse? 

01:00:10
LESLIE Right. 

01:00:10
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. So, how do… how do we help you get… feel stronger and know that you can make it? 'Cause Evy had the same fear that she couldn't be alone. 

01:00:25
LESLIE I don't want to be alone. 

01:00:30
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. And you don't have to be alone. 

01:00:35
LESLIE I have abandonment issues. 

01:00:35
DR. ED JACOBS But what you are trying to do, may be, is to be with Miles and it doesn't… And you are afraid that it may not work with him. You don't have to be alone. There's none of you that have to be alone. 

01:00:50
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL But I don't know if being with Miles necessarily is where this thing is headed. I mean, I don't know. Right. Being… I think you've got it. It's… maybe it's that Miles… It's either with Miles or alone? 

01:01:10
ASRA But you are alone with him anyway. So… 

01:01:10
EVY MCPHERSON You are. 

01:01:10
ASRA You have created a situation where… 

01:01:15
EVY MCPHERSON And being… I didn't want to be alone either, and I'm alone right now. But that doesn't mean I will be alone forever. It's a temporary stage, I feel, in my life. 

01:01:25
DR. ED JACOBS But what you are saying, Chris, is yeah, if you believe it's either Miles or nobody. 

01:01:30
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Or aloneness. 

01:01:30
LESLIE Right. 

01:01:30
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. Then, "I'm gonna keep Miles and put up with all this crap." 

01:01:35
EVY MCPHERSON And it sounds like you are lonely within anyway, even with him around you are lonely. He's not filling that gap. 

01:01:40
RUTH Yeah. I think you need to fix yourself. I think that you can just start from the ground up. The more you care about yourself and the stronger that you get. Alone is not as scary. Whenever you feel bad about yourself… I love living alone now. Alone is awesome. 

01:01:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL It's healthy. 

01:01:55
RUTH It means you don't hurt. It means somebody may make me feel about myself. 

01:02:00
EVY MCPHERSON Yeah, I like it too. 

01:02:00
MISTY It's like you are willing to take that crumb of attention that Miles gives you. But what you really want is the whole slice of bread. And he's not capable of doing that at this point in his life. 

01:02:10
LESLIE And that scares me, because I… You know, I didn't go into my marriage thinking… second marriage… I seem to find addicts. My first one was a… addicted to alcohol. 

01:02:35
DR. ED JACOBS Were your family members, were they addicted? 

01:02:35
LESLIE No, no. 

01:02:35
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

01:02:35
LESLIE And I swore that I would never be… 

01:02:40
DR. ED JACOBS But if you don't feel good about yourself, your ability to pick good people is impossible. 

01:02:45
EVY MCPHERSON And I like you, I have picked two cheating husbands. So, I've got to fix myself and learn how to pick someone that's not that way, you know. If that ever happens again, which I, you know, at this point… 

01:03:00
IVY And the unknown is always scary. It's always scary, but once you are in it you think, well, why I was so afraid of him. 

01:03:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Watch how the leader uses two members to dramatize a member's internal dialogue. This can be a very powerful technique and it often helps both the members who are playing the different parts and those watching. When using this technique, the leader has to carefully monitor those playing the parts to make sure they don't put their own issues into the dialogue. In this situation, it was helpful for the member playing the adult part of the working member Evy, because she at times struggles to be at her adult ego state. 

01:03:40
DR. ED JACOBS It's this seat… versus this seat. And… And I think you know this seat, but you don't know this one very well, right. Now if we want to use a member, can someone play her? 

01:04:00
ASRA I can. 

01:04:00
DR. ED JACOBS But… But the way she is. 

01:04:00
ASRA Yes, I can. 

01:04:05
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

01:04:05
ASRA Yeah. 

01:04:05
DR. ED JACOBS Can someone play a more healthy her? 

01:04:05
EVY MCPHERSON Sure. 

01:04:10
DR. ED JACOBS Put your… 

01:04:10
ASRA I know, exactly. There you go. Yeah, because I don't think your six-year-old self is drinking a cup of coffee anyway. 

01:04:20
DR. ED JACOBS But… But… But you are just the scared… 

01:04:20
ASRA Yeah. 

01:04:20
DR. ED JACOBS …I can't be alone and not gonna put up with his stuff. 

01:04:30
ASRA Umm… I can't take it. I'm just dying, but I need him and I have to have him. And where is he, where did he go? Why isn't he here? And I don't know what I'm gonna do right now. I'm just being so alone. 

01:04:50
EVY MCPHERSON But I know I'm gonna be okay. 

01:04:55
ASRA I'm not. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm literally gonna die. 

01:05:00
EVY MCPHERSON But you're dying now and you're gonna be okay. 

01:05:05
DR. ED JACOBS What do you add? What do you want out of a relationship? 

01:05:10
EVY MCPHERSON I want someone that's by my side, that umm… loves me unconditionally, that umm… 

01:05:15
ASRA But I don't deserve it. 

01:05:15
EVY MCPHERSON …that will not abuse drugs. That… That will always… 

01:05:20
DR. ED JACOBS Can you trust him? 

01:05:20
EVY MCPHERSON And trust, yes. I want someone to trust. 

01:05:25
ASRA No, I mean, I… if he's just the… if he just right next to me, that's good enough. He doesn't have to do anything more. I just need him right there. 

01:05:30
EVY MCPHERSON I know I'm gonna be okay with or without him. I know… 

01:05:30
DR. ED JACOBS Let me just stop. Is this helpful? What part is helpful? Just seeing it? And you have this… I don't even know if you have that voice. And she's is, yeah, that's a good voice. Okay, keep going. 

01:05:45
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yeah, Asra too… remember, earlier too, she had the stuff about the sentence from childhood which was… 

01:05:50
ASRA I'm not worthy. 

01:05:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I'm not… I'm not wanted, right? 

01:05:55
ASRA Yeah. 

01:05:55
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. Drugs or say something. Drugs are more important. 

01:06:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yeah. I can put up with drugs because he wants me. 

01:06:00
ASRA Yeah, I mean, he… he is here and he is, you know, I don't care about the drugs, I don't care if he's gone, I don't care if he's with his family. And he's gonna comeback and he's gonna right with me. And… The drugs, it's just… he's got an addiction and I don't know, that's messed up, but, like, it's… he's still here. 

01:06:20
EVY MCPHERSON But I'm a good person and I don't deserve being treated that way. 

01:06:25
ASRA No, it's good enough. It's good enough, he's right there. He's like a man next to me and he's, you know, he doesn't hear me, he hasn't talked to me, I don't see him. 

01:06:35
DR. ED JACOBS We have more than one voice here too, but I'm also scared. I'm… I'm… I need him and I want him and I'm scared that he won't be there then I'm pissed off at him. I'm mad at him all the time too because I think he's doing all those drugs. We can just keep… You and I, just overwhelm… 

01:07:00
EVY MCPHERSON I'm a good person though and I deserve more, I deserve better. 

01:07:00
ASRA Oh, no, I don't. I don't deserve anything. I'm worthless. Like, you know, it's just, look at the way… Like, people they don't like me. Nobody likes me. 

01:07:10
DR. ED JACOBS I get so mad at him that I want him and then when I… then I get scared he's gonna leave me, then I'm gonna be alone 'cause that abandonment. I felt abandoned. 

01:07:20
ASRA When I hold on to him so tight. 

01:07:20
DR. ED JACOBS How are we helping? 

01:07:20
LESLIE Ask me. 

01:07:25
The leader joins in to heighten the working member's understanding of all that is happening in her head. Note how the leaders keep asking, "How are we helping?" 

01:07:25
DR. ED JACOBS So how do we help you get to that scene? 

01:07:30
LESLIE I don't know. 

01:07:30
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. But that's where we… Because if you don't… with these two, it's just a mess. And you… took you a long time. 

01:07:40
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL And it's probably overwhelming, even too, sitting there, right. 

01:07:40
EVY MCPHERSON Oh, it is, I… Yeah. 

01:07:45
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Like, how do I battle both of you on. 

01:07:45
EVY MCPHERSON Right, right 

01:07:45
MISTY This chair is much easier, but that chair is well worth it. 

01:07:50
LESLIE Yeah. 

01:07:50
MISTY The pain, believe me. 

01:07:50
EVY MCPHERSON But the lack of trust, will, it'd consume you. 

01:07:55
ASRA And I'm sure… Like, when Ed came in, it's so confusing. So it's like… And, you know, she didn't say a lot. It's almost like, you need just one or two messages that caused… 

01:08:10
DR. ED JACOBS And we got to help, you get stronger to do it… 

01:08:10
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL We've got to make this… I… I think we got to make this one exist for you. 

01:08:15
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

01:08:15
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I'm not even sure she's in the ball game yet, is she? It's just those two. 

01:08:20
LESLIE Yeah. 

01:08:20
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yeah. We've got to help you build… 

01:08:25
DR. ED JACOBS And you think you are busy, you are doing something, but these two go back in, there's all these voices of anger and then guilt and then fear and then this. And… 'cause when you said, that he said that very mean thing to you, instead of, you know, I hope you have a good day today, honey. He didn't say that. He said, why aren't you… 

01:08:40
EVY MCPHERSON Not only that, he's being selfish, but not allowing you to grow and… and… and take from this to make yourself feel better, you know, it's, it's… 

01:08:50
IVY I wonder if he has the same issues as you do then he wants to keep you right there too and so you're feeding into each other a little bit, maybe. 

01:08:55
RUTH But I think he might be a little bit afraid of what comes from today. 

01:09:00
LESLIE Right. 

01:09:00
DR. ED JACOBS Well, we also… Yeah, I think so too. And he's also an addict. 

01:09:05
ASRA But just to be fair too and since he's not in our group, I think everything that you all said, you can say about her. She's afraid. She doesn't want to grow, she… you know, all of that stuff because it's… you're hearing, you are allowing both voices from him to just be mirrors on yourself. 

01:09:25
DR. ED JACOBS Ruth, because when I first met you, you were struggling with the breakup with the boyfriend and all that business, right? 

01:09:35
RUTH Uh-hmm. 

01:09:35
DR. ED JACOBS And that's all you focused on, I think with… 

01:09:40
RUTH That was actually the reason I started going was because he had been gone for a year and a half and I still hadn't break up or… and I never had a problem with it. Before he usually, week or two with him being gone and I was good as new, but he did so much emotional damage to me in the time that he was in my life. That… That you know, when I real… after several sessions, I realized that there was a deeper underlying problem and that's early in childhood, someone like him was predestined for he was, you know, he was to come along into my life and I would accept that because what I learned as a child. 

01:10:20
DR. ED JACOBS Do you believe that you are a good deal that you can sit there, in that seat? 

01:10:30
RUTH Yes, I do. 

01:10:30
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, you believe that. How about… Where are you with that, Misty ? 

01:10:35
[sil.] 

01:10:40
MISTY I'm there sometimes and I'm getting better at being there. But I would have to say, I've… I struggled a lot getting there, but you know… 

01:10:50
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL But you at least have the voice in the fight. 

01:10:50
MISTY I do. 

01:10:50
DR. ED JACOBS She does now. 

01:10:50
MISTY I do now. Yeah. 

01:10:55
RUTH There are so other moments sometimes where I feel like somebody is too good for me, like a certain guy is too good for me. 

01:11:00
MISTY Oh, same here. 

01:11:00
RUTH You know, but… I… that's why I'm not dating because I don't want to go out with somebody that I think it's good enough for me that really isn't… That's what I've done my whole life. 

01:11:10
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah… And if a good guy came along, you might not think you were worthy. 

01:11:15
RUTH Right. 

01:11:15
MISTY Yeah, I'm seeing a guy now and he's a good guy and… and I just in… You know, he's very successful. And the whole time I'm just… When I leave, I'm just thinking why is he dating a white trash like me? If you're gonna accept his addiction and just live your life without, you know, if he's like I'm gonna (inaudible ) All right, have a good trip. And not be, but still, you know… 

01:11:40
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Say some more. Yeah, that's what I'm… and I'm wondering, Leslie. Just wondering if… Part of what we're talking about, takes time and not one day at a time approach. I'm wondering if we just helped you with relief of your anger. You know, if you were just less angry, day to day. I imagine that anger is tough to deal with. 

01:12:05
LESLIE Oh yeah. 

01:12:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL We are strong advocates for making counseling more visual and more concrete. Impact therapy is an approach to counseling that emphasizes being multi-sensory. It should be noted, that in a group that was not being filmed, the whiteboard would be in a better position. Later on, we use a small whiteboard and place it in the center of the group on the floor. So that when people glance down they are reminded to think about their should's. We believe a whiteboard or flipchart is a valuable tool for focusing the members on certain issues or concepts. 

01:12:35
DR. ED JACOBS I'm gonna use this whiteboard for a second. The key to anger is… Should, that's what causes anger, as you have a should, he should. 

01:12:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL He should get off (inaudible ). 

01:12:57
DR. ED JACOBS You know and same thing… 

01:12:57
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL He should want to… 

01:12:57
DR. ED JACOBS Your… Your ex-husband should, you know, Evy, with your deal. I know you've solved it, it should. If you can let go of the should, because it sounds like he is an addict. And addicts… and he's addicted to this Methadone for now. And he doesn't seem like he's gonna get off of it. I get that what you were getting at, right? 

01:13:20
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yeah, the… He… He… He should want to kick this methadone. He should want to do it differently. He shouldn't want to use anything else. He… He… He should want to do this for our marriage, you know. Boy, that generates a lot of… 

01:13:30
LESLIE Anger. 

01:13:30
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL …anger. 

01:13:35
DR. ED JACOBS So what can you… What can she tell herself different than that? 

01:13:40
ASRA That he is an addict. I've chosen for now to be with him. And umm… I am here and this is just the way it is. 

01:13:50
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Say… Say that piece again about the choosing. 

01:13:55
ASRA I've chosen to be with him, for now. Yeah, and I'm gonna live with that for now and move day to day. 

01:14:00
DR. ED JACOBS And if it… Are you trapped forever? 

01:14:05
ASRA No. I'm just… Right now, this is the way it is. And umm… and… 

01:14:10
DR. ED JACOBS But then did it piss you off that he's doing it? 

01:14:10
ASRA Yeah, it's not right, but you know, it's what I've… right now, I'm not in a place emotionally or financially or personally to move forward. So, I just got to live with how he is. 

01:14:25
DR. ED JACOBS But shouldn't he do it differently? 

01:14:30
ASRA You know, it's funny when you start accepting it. You don't even… I don't, right now, have the capacity to even say he should be different because I'm just saying to myself over and over again. 

01:14:40
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL He's… He's not. 

01:14:40
ASRA He's this way and I'm also offering myself, the little girl the oppur… I mean, 'cause I was playing a little girl, I really wasn't, right then. But I can't even… I don't even have the language to say he should be a different way because when I kept saying, he just is this way. And this is what a… this is the lot in life that I've accepted for myself, right now. And like, maybe, tomorrow, I'll choose something different, but right now this is what I chose. 

01:15:10
DR. ED JACOBS Let me pick up and take this to everybody in a way and then we'll come back to you. But do you have should's for your in-laws? 

01:15:15
IVY Oh, my gosh, yes. That's the first thing that popped in my head when you said the should's, I thought, oh, my God. I'm should'ing everybody constantly. 

01:15:25
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

01:15:25
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I'll be should'ing all over the place. 

01:15:25
DR. ED JACOBS Yes. But… But do you… Who do you have should's for, in your life? Let's… You said in… in-laws? 

01:15:35
IVY No, I have should's for my husband because his job is so demanding. He's gone a lot and I'm like, you know, shouldn't he be here with me? He shouldn't be working so much. Yeah, it's just everything. Yeah, it's… I realized I have a lot of should's. 

01:15:45
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. Okay 

01:15:50
MISTY Umm… My children, my ex-husband umm… 

01:15:55
DR. ED JACOBS They should what? What should your ex-husband do? 

01:16:00
MISTY Should be treating me better or should be treating his son better. 

01:16:00
DR. ED JACOBS Right. 

01:16:00
MISTY Before he gets off the prison. Should be treating his… his daughter better, I mean, you know, he just should, should, should. 

01:16:10
DR. ED JACOBS So you have a lot of should's? 

01:16:10
MISTY I do. 

01:16:10
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. Evy, do you have should's? 

01:16:10
EVY MCPHERSON Oh, yeah, I have should's for my soon to be ex-husband, umm… for my kids. 

01:16:20
DR. ED JACOBS And then if you keep having the should's, you stay mad. Should's is the essence of anger. How about for you, Ruth? 

01:16:25
RUTH (inaudible ) I don't know if there's many because I've realized that's what you told me. You have your expectations instead of what the true lead is. And I try now not to expect as much from her because I know I'm not going to get it. 

01:16:45
MISTY Well, I think that umm… having your expectations in line with reality is one of the number two or three… 

01:16:50
RUTH For these things ever? 

01:16:50
MISTY Yes. But it also has been so profound in my life. I do it, every day I say it to somebody. Umm… One of my friends, somebody, one of my kids. And, you know, and it just makes you accept, that's acceptance. You know, you have to accept your husband is a drug addict and that's hard for you to do. But, you know, what's the reality? What do you expect and what's the reality? You know, you're expecting not to be a drug addict, but the reality is, he is in and, you know, that's just… that's been the easiest thing for me to comprehend and to this day has made my life so much easier. 

01:17:25
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, it should. Let me get Asra and then we'll get to you. 

01:17:30
ASRA Yeah, I think this is really genius because umm… framing and the language we use about other people. It was a light bulb turned on for me and so yeah it's with everybody. My father is in his 80s and he should know how to sit down and have a conversation with me. My little dog is, you know, three-years-old and still pulls on the leash. She should be trained even though nobody has trained her yet. And so I love this as a method, yeah, framing it. 

01:18:00
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. Evy, you remember what you are (inaudible )? 

01:18:02
EVY MCPHERSON Yeah. Accept the fact that you can't change it. I think, I finally did that, that I couldn't change the alcoholism and the way I was being treated at home by my umm… husband. And I finally accepted. I was accepting the way it was, but then I finally accepted I can't change it. So, I don't want to be here, this is not me, that I don't want to live my life the rest of my life this way. So, accepting that piece of it is really hard. 

01:18:30
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, the… the… the should's and what you were saying Ivy, it's just that the… there's should's for all kinds of people. A lot of times, it's for spouses, you know, and that's what causes… I guess what Chris picked up on for sure is about the anger. Anger, if you change the word "should" to it's unfortunate or it would be nice or… 

01:18:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I wish. 

01:18:55
DR. ED JACOBS I wish. 

01:18:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I wish he would get off the methadone, but unfortunately he's probably not going to. For now, I'm choosing to stay. 

01:19:05
DR. ED JACOBS What a crummy thing to get up every morning and being like a… 

01:19:05
LESLIE Yeah. 

01:19:05
DR. ED JACOBS And you don't have to, that's a choice. You do not have to be mad. 

01:19:10
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yeah, I think that was my point. These other facets of what you're dealing with, are gonna take time. Right. They are gonna take time for you to decide, stay, don't stay, you know, have a different strategy. But why, why wake up every morning and be mad, and just be angry? That one, I think, you can get under control. You can do something different about that. Would you all agree with that? Pretty quickly she can do something with that anger. 

01:19:35
LESLIE Yeah. 

01:19:40
DR. ED JACOBS Do you walk around, if you are in that seat, you got a hammer. You're either beating on others or beating on yourself. And if you are in that seat, you put that hammer down. So, that… that's what I want to just say to you. This one has the hammer, that one is not a hammer. And do you believe you can sit there? It would be a whole mind shift for you. Do you think you can sit there and try it, or do you want us or somebody else to sit there and show what you… what… How can we help you to get to that seat? We're showing it to you, but can you do it? Do you want to try there? I know you are pretty good at that one. What would be helpful? 

01:20:30
LESLIE That one scares me. 

01:20:30
RUTH So how about (inaudible ). 

01:20:34
DR. ED JACOBS Wait, wait, wait a second, let her, let her just… Says that one scares me. How do you scare yourself? What… What is that How does that scares you? 

01:20:45
LESLIE Because then I have to accept it. 

01:20:50
DR. ED JACOBS And then you have to accept and therefore you accept it and then you have to live this way or you're gonna be trapped forever or… Why is that seat not better than… And I think we do see that seat is scary, that's what I'm saying. 

01:21:05
MISTY Damn scary, believe me. 

01:21:10
DR. ED JACOBS But it's better. 

01:21:10
MISTY It is. It's worth paying. 

01:21:10
EVY MCPHERSON It's being in-charge of your life, that's what it is. 

01:21:15
MISTY Yes. 

01:21:15
DR. ED JACOBS Otherwise you are not in charge of the seat. If you are here, the little girl, because you want to make… You are scared, if I sit in that seat, I'm gonna accept it and what? I've got to put up. It isn't changing. 

01:21:30
LESLIE Right. 

01:21:30
DR. ED JACOBS And I love what Asra said earlier, I thought it was good. You know that… 

01:21:35
IVY It's a safe place to do it. 

01:21:40
ASRA Say that again, Ivy. 

01:21:40
IVY It's a safe place to try it. 

01:21:40
ASRA Here, being here is safe to try. 

01:21:40
IVY Yeah. 

01:21:45
DR. ED JACOBS Sit there and just see, what tell us what comes up or what… what it's… Or maybe you don't even know what to say there or do you need to… Go ahead. What would help you? 

01:21:55
LESLIE I don't even know how to act or… 

01:22:00
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

01:22:00
LESLIE Or be in that seat. 

01:22:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Well, would it be more helpful to watch it some more, to… like before when Evy was playing that part and Asra was playing, is that more helpful? 

01:22:15
LESLIE I think no(ph). 

01:22:15
ASRA Would it help for us to sit beside you? I remember you said you wanted support, right. Would it help that we pulled up a couple of chairs next to you and we're there with you. 

01:22:30
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, we'll be there for you. But… But I think you just don't even have an idea of what that voice he is. And if you don't have that voice then you know you're in this seat and… and you don't like it, you hate it. 

01:22:40
LESLIE Right. 

01:22:40
DR. ED JACOBS Right. And then you are scared to death if I sit in that seat, I'm either… Because if this seat is pursuing happiness or an enjoyable life… 

01:22:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Peace, this seat is peace. 

01:22:55
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, peace. 

01:22:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL This seat has peace involved. And that's not, and again, I just want to… We're not all sitting here saying you need to leave it. You know, this is not the big woman charge ahead and leave it, you know, but there is peace here. 

01:23:10
LESLIE How do I deal with that peace? 'Cause I've never had it. 

01:23:20
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. Right. 

01:23:25
MISTY It's… Actually it's hard to deal with it. 

01:23:25
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

01:23:25
MISTY I'd never had it, I'm getting it. But I also, when I knew I was on the road to getting it, I would sabotage it. 

01:23:35
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

01:23:35
MISTY Because I never thought I deserved it. And so I'm getting better at deserving peace. But like being in this chair. I mean, Ed couldn't shut me up. Being in this chair, I didn't know, I was beat(ph), I didn't know what to say, nothing came out of my mouth. And I'm getting better at being in this chair. And I… And as I get in that chair, more and more, it's… my life is more at peace. And umm… you know that's… But once you know you're getting it, you know, and you just want to keep moving forward with it. 

01:24:10
DR. ED JACOBS Ruth, what are you thinking? 

01:24:10
RUTH I was just thinking about what she said about sabotaging yourself because I did it like three months ago and then it took me a month to get over it, you know. But like I think, it had such a horrible impact on me because I knew I was getting better and… and it just felt like such a horrible setback, you know, but I think it was like this… 

01:24:30
DR. ED JACOBS It's, sort of, an incident with the guy and stuff, yeah. 

01:24:30
RUTH Yeah, yeah. 

01:24:35
IVY I'm focused on, when you said, if you sit on the chair, you feel like you're accepting everything. And that seems to me like you are saying, then I have to live with it and accept it and be there. But it doesn't necessarily have to be that. It can be you're accepting the situation and it's gonna slowly change with your acceptance. It's not accepting it, and here I am, and this is it, done. That might be what you're thinking. 

01:24:55
RUTH I think you've already accepted it. Like, staying with him for seven years, you've accepted it. 

01:25:00
IVY Yeah. 

01:25:00
RUTH You just may have told yourself you haven't, but you can sit in that chair and accept it for yourself or you're in peace. 

01:25:10
DR. ED JACOBS I think what you said, when Chris said it's peace, and you said I don't, I've never had peace ever in your life. Yeah. 

01:25:15
RUTH So that's so familiar to you. 

01:25:20
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, that… Yeah, that… the word familiar is a good one. 

01:25:20
ASRA Yeah. 

01:25:20
DR. ED JACOBS Is… It's familiar to do this whether you don't like it, but it's familiar. 

01:25:30
ASRA Right. You don't even know what that feels like. 

01:25:30
LESLIE Right. 

01:25:30
DR. ED JACOBS Are you willing to work towards really just that seat? In that seat, I… we promise you that seat is a better life, better situation than this one. 

01:25:40
MISTY It's like in this seat you're putting your happiness in his hands. In that seat you're putting your happiness in your hands. So… 

01:25:45
DR. ED JACOBS Well. 

01:25:45
MISTY You… You are not… You're just, you know… I mean that seat's… towards that I am telling you. I'm not there as much as I want to be, but… 

01:25:55
DR. EDITOR JACOBS I know. 

01:25:55
IVY Maybe, you're gonna get to know that. 

01:26:00
MISTY You know, it's worth it. 

01:26:00
DR. ED JACOBS Misty used to come and say I want to get in the big girl's seat. I have to sit (inaudible ) And then I can then… I can then throw it back to her. Misty, you are not. 

01:26:10
MISTY Yeah, you're not doing what you needed to do. 

01:26:10
DR. ED JACOBS That's not big girl stuff. 

01:26:10
MISTY Yeah. 

01:26:10
DR. ED JACOBS You know. 

01:26:15
MISTY But then when I want to do big girl stuff, you know, I'd have to call him, text him. You know, it was just like telling your mom you just dove off the high dive at the pool. You know, I would have to call Ed and say, oh, guess what I did today? You know, my big girl stuff last week was I'm taking a shower at the gym. I feel very weird, you know, so umm… 

01:26:35
DR. ED JACOBS And that's a big deal that she did that. I mean, yeah. 

01:26:35
MISTY It's a big deal for me. And I took everything, believe me, I was a cluster. Everything was dropped and I was just like, oh, my god, you know. But, you know, I called Ed and I was like, oh, guess what I did. I took a shower at the gym today, you know. I don't know if I'll do it again, but, you know, that was a huge step for me. 

01:26:55
DR. ED JACOBS Well, I hope you will. 

01:26:55
MISTY I will. No, I will, but, you know, I'm just… 

01:26:55
DR. ED JACOBS But you got to do at some and just going in to Elder-Beerman and… 

01:27:00
MISTY Yeah. 

01:27:00
DR. ED JACOBS I mean, there's all those steps that if you don't… Here's what I guarantee. If you sit there and don't… go sit there for a second, I'll show you that. 

01:27:15
Note the power of watching the member move to the Adult (big) chair and the meaning it has for the working member. 

01:27:20
DR. ED JACOBS Now I want you to figure out how you can get to that seat while staying in that seat. What you… In order to get there what do you have to do? 

01:27:30
LESLIE Pull that one closer to me. 

01:27:30
DR. ED JACOBS Well, are you… But to get there, you can't move the chairs. In order to get there… 

01:27:35
IVY That's what I would have done. 

01:27:40
DR. ED JACOBS Good. But what's the other way to do it? Say that you don't have to stay in that seat. But if you want to get to that seat, what do you have to do? 

01:27:45
LESLIE And I can't move the chairs? 

01:27:45
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. What would you have to do? 

01:27:50
IVY There you go. 

01:27:50
DR. ED JACOBS That's right. That's right. How you feel sitting there? Do you want to run back there? 

01:27:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Do you realize what you just did, when you sat there? 

01:28:00
ASRA You're relaxed, I thought, I saw. 

01:28:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Did you hear her? Did you hear her sigh out? 

01:28:05
ASRA I mean, and her whole body language… 

01:28:05
EVY MCPHERSON You also made a step to be happy too. 

01:28:05
RUTH Yeah. 

01:28:10
ASRA And it was so easy and effortless. I mean, it was actually phenomenal. 

01:28:10
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yeah, you sat there and instantly went huh! 

01:28:15
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, you really did move pretty quick. I mean, a lot of people can't do it. They just say I can't do it. 

01:28:25
ASRA Yeah, and look at… you're smiling. 

01:28:25
LESLIE This is where I want to be. 

01:28:25
ASRA Yeah. 

01:28:25
LESLIE This is I want to be here. 

01:28:30
ASRA You're smiling and you're… and you look really confident. You really do. You look… Because you know what, it really strikes me is that at the very beginning when you introduced yourself, you said, when the first thing the people see in me is, well, how did you put it? 

01:28:45
LESLIE My personality. 

01:28:45
ASRA And what kind of personality was it? A good one, right? And so… And then you've become something that you don't even want to be. 

01:28:55
LESLIE Right. 

01:28:55
ASRA And… And we (inaudible ). 

01:28:56
LESLIE It's kind of like a (inaudible ). 

01:28:57
ASRA Yeah. 

01:28:57
LESLIE Yeah. 

01:28:57
ASRA But… But you know, I'm sure that causes a lot of conflict within self, hate within yourself. 

01:29:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Your… Your persona is not your personality. And I think that's what maybe you are putting out there as your persona. 

01:29:10
LESLIE Yeah. 

01:29:10
DR. ED JACOBS Let me just go around and just… I'll start with you, Ruth, on this. Just how is this helping you not… then we'll come back and focus on Leslie, if we don't freeze to death. How is this… is this helping you in some way, Ruth? And what are you thinking about as we're doing this part? 

01:29:30
RUTH Oh! I'm thinking about the stuff, sort of, that took for me to get to that chair. 

01:29:35
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

01:29:35
RUTH And I know I'm in it a lot more than I was. 

01:29:40
DR. ED JACOBS And you're a… your big downfall is probably with Nikki(ph), right? 

01:29:45
RUTH Yeah. 

01:29:45
DR. ED JACOBS You go back or she tells me about the fight she has with Nikki and… 

01:29:50
RUTH Oh, yeah. I think that that chair is pretty much out of my life except for where she is concerned. And I believe it's glued to my butt most days. 

01:30:00
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. Evy, what is this helping you with? 

01:30:05
EVY MCPHERSON Well, it… it umm… it's makes me realize you have to take a step to get there and conquer that fear. It's of the fear keeps us there. Umm… You know, I… and to maintain confidence that I can, I can do this, I'm gonna be okay, so you have to keep telling yourself, I'm gonna be okay. 

01:30:20
DR. ED JACOBS 'Cause I know, you really have been scared to death. 

01:30:25
EVY MCPHERSON Oh, I have, I have. 

01:30:25
DR. ED JACOBS I mean, she really has. She looks confident, but she was scared to death in her life and then, and I gave her that line that she's been a human doing instead of a human being. 

01:30:40
EVY MCPHERSON I've been taking care of everybody else's needs first and then for my end. 

01:30:40
DR. ED JACOBS Because you didn't think you mattered? 

01:30:45
EVY MCPHERSON Right, exactly. 

01:30:45
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

01:30:45
EVY MCPHERSON And… And just… that the fear of being out on the street and not being able to take care of myself was huge, you know. 

01:30:55
DR. ED JACOBS But taking these steps and getting there, you can have a peaceful life. That we promise is possible. I don't know if you're gonna have a peaceful life with Miles, maybe, maybe not, I don't know. It's hard to have a peaceful with an addict, depends. Misty, what is this doing for you? 

01:31:15
MISTY Umm… It's just… It makes me umm… very humble to know that other people struggle with that little girl. And it's… And that, you know, I'm not the only one who struggles with it on a daily basis. And, you know, and I think it's very impairing just to see you get up from there and get over there, unless your whole body went into a relax mood. To me, that just, you know, you're… that's the first step, is wanting to get over there and then being aware in mind, you know, that's what helped me. And, you know, it has helped me just umm… to listen to everybody's input. 

01:31:50
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I… I would even challenge you to… to hear. I want to tweak a little bit what we're saying too. We want you all… all of us I think want Leslie to be happy, right. 

01:32:00
ASRA Absolutely. 

01:32:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL But even put that down the road, I'm more concerned that you get some relief. 

01:32:05
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

01:32:10
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Just some relief. If you can… if you get relief then you can work on happiness. 

01:32:10
DR. ED JACOBS Right. 

01:32:10
LESLIE Yeah. 

01:32:15
DR. ED JACOBS And then the should… 

01:32:15
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yeah. 

01:32:15
DR. ED JACOBS Getting rid of the should will help give you some relief. 

01:32:15
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Relief. 

01:32:15
LESLIE Yeah. 

01:32:20
For the next 10 minutes, members share about trust in their love relationship history and then break for lunch. 

01:32:30
[sil.] 

01:32:35
Working Phase Session 3 

01:32:35
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Because there are two new members and it is after a lunch break. the session starts with a warm-up round. You will see the leaders use rounds as a way of generating energy and as a way to get the new members comfortable with being in the group. Note how the leaders do not focus much time at the beginning on the new members, but rather let them ease themselves into the group process. After the warm-up, the leaders focus on the topic of guilt. Since a couple of the members mentioned it and the topic of guilt is almost always a good topic for a counseling group. In this segment, the leaders also help members with the topics of self-confidence and worry. During this session, the leaders show how to work deeply with a member while keeping other members engaged. The following are a list of skills to look for in this working phase of the group. 1. Use of rounds for engagement. 2. Use of props and chairs to increase engagement. 3. The art of picking good topics to which most members can relate. 4. Getting, holding and deepening the focus on a person and a topic. 5. Shifting the focus to other members and to other topics. 6. Asking good deepening questions for more engagement. 7. Use of drama for effect and engagement. 8. Drawing out. 9. Use of theories. 

01:34:10
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. We're back from lunch. We have two new members. I thought what we would do is go around and just say, for the people that had been here, I mean, that were here this morning. What is something that you are thinking about or what stood out to you very briefly. Just say your name and what stood out or something briefly from this morning and then we'll move on from there. But that's the way for you all to know, sort of, what happened. 

01:34:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:34:45
DR. ED JACOBS Who wants to start? 

01:34:45
EVY MCPHERSON I will. 

01:34:45
DR. ED JACOBS Go ahead. 

01:34:50
EVY MCPHERSON Like how important self-confidence is and setting boundaries with individuals who are maybe not so nice to you. 

01:34:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL And you are Evy. 

01:35:00
EVY MCPHERSON Oh, and I'm Evy. 

01:35:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yeah. 

01:35:00
EVY MCPHERSON Yeah, sorry. 

01:35:05
RUTH Umm… I'm Ruth and I would say what she said, and the importance of having self-confidence and boundaries. 

01:35:10
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, and believing in yourself. Because they had been… I don't know. What you described it as a doormat, not the (inaudible ) doormat, but you didn't… You gave a whole lot in your marriages or in your relationship. Asra? 

01:35:30
ASRA So my name is Asra and I think that what I reflected on is, how universal the experiences of… of just to struggle within everybody's lives to be healthy, even if we go into adulthood. And, you know, just how just umm… amazing it must be if you actually arrive into adulthood as an adult. Instead of having to wait all these years, you know, to figure it out. 

01:36:00
DR. ED JACOBS Misty? 

01:36:05
MISTY Umm… I just have to say setting boundaries for people and self-confidence is… You know, basically that's in my world. the main step to getting a divorce. 

01:36:15
DR. ED JACOBS And you are saying believe in that mostly in love relationship's or in every… 

01:36:20
MISTY Just in everyday life. Just, you know… 

01:36:25
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

01:36:25
MISTY Confronting people that need confronted and letting go of the small stuff, that's doesn't, that's trivial. And just, you know, picking your battles, it's with everything. Just self-confidence and just everything you do. You know it's from worn-out on a day to, you know, or you want to be, am I dressed well enough to be here today? You know, did I overdo it. Just, you know, just quit second guessing myself every time I turn the corner. 

01:36:50
IVY I think what I've gathered from the first couple of sessions we've had here is umm… people seem to be really, really, really difficult on themselves. Umm… I think it would be nice to learn how to be easier and more forgiving to yourself. 

01:37:10
LESLIE I'm Leslie and I have learned that I can be strong. I will get there. 

01:37:15
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

01:37:20
LESLIE It's just gonna take time. 

01:37:20
SHIRLEY Good for you. 

01:37:20
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, she did a lot of work with this… this morning. A lot of people did a lot of work this morning. 

01:37:25
SHIRLEY Good. 

01:37:30
DR. ED JACOBS Let me just open this up in… in this way. In… In, I know Shirley and Stacy were saying, what… what's gonna happen here? And I think you asked what's… who… what you did Evy is that, "What… What are we gonna talk about next?" Really, I want you to think about anything in your life that would be helpful to talk about. And then I'm gonna just see is, yes or no if there's something you would like us to discuss. You know, and… and I think, you know, Shirley and Stacy, may be ready right now or a little bit later on, it's fine. But is there something, an issue… I mean it can have to do with parents, it can have to do with guilt, it can have to do with shame, any unfinished business with something. And sickly… 

01:38:20
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL More worry. 

01:38:25
DR. ED JACOBS Huh, worry, worry is a big one, yeah. 

01:38:25
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL That's huge. 

01:38:25
DR. ED JACOBS And so I'm just gonna ask for a yes or a no, if there's a topic that, that… or a subject that you would like to bring up and get some feedback on. Let's start. Yes, there's something. Okay, Evy. 

01:38:45
EVY MCPHERSON How do we overcome everyday worry and you know… 

01:38:50
DR. ED JACOBS So the topic of worry. 

01:38:50
EVY MCPHERSON The topic of worry is, yes, big. 

01:38:55
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. Anything, Ruth? 

01:38:55
RUTH I don't have anything delivered. 

01:38:55
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

01:38:55
ASRA Umm… Gosh, uh… 

01:39:00
DR. ED JACOBS And it's fine if it's a no. 

01:39:00
ASRA Yeah, I don't think… I mean, yeah. 

01:39:05
DR. ED JACOBS Misty. 

01:39:05
MISTY Umm… I don't know. I just… I guess I'd fall on that lack of self-confidence. How do I get to that? 

01:39:15
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. So we can come back and work on this. 

01:39:15
MISTY Yes. 

01:39:20
DR. ED JACOBS Stacy? 

01:39:20
STACY Umm… Maybe guilt. 

01:39:20
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

01:39:25
IVY Maybe, how to deal with people that are very narcissist. 

01:39:30
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. Yeah. 

01:39:30
ASRA I think going back, thinking of the one that I always, I'm always thinking about a lot is just how to bring healing to yourself, for the things that maybe within your own? 

01:39:45
DR. ED JACOBS Shirley, anything? 

01:39:45
SHIRLEY I'm gonna go with self-confidence because I'm second guessing. I do that a lot. 

01:39:50
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, that's right. 

01:39:50
SHIRLEY About myself. 

01:39:55
[sil.] 

01:40:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Did you get (inaudible )? 

01:40:01
LESLIE It would be guilt. 

01:40:05
DR. ED JACOBS Oh, okay. That's right, guilt. Let's talk about the guilt thing for a minute. Let's do guilt and then we'll do self-confidence and then should… And then if there's other things take advantage of that. What did… you said guilt? 

01:40:15
MISTY I said self-confidence. 

01:40:15
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. You said guilt and you said guilt. What would your guilt be about? 

01:40:25
LESLIE Mine would be… big issues with my husband, umm… walking away from our marriage. 

01:40:35
DR. ED JACOBS And feeling guilty of doing it. 

01:40:35
LESLIE Yeah. 

01:40:40
DR. ED JACOBS The guilt would be doing something… Guilt is always doing something wrong. What would you think? Is that what you would feel like? 

01:40:45
LESLIE Yeah. 

01:40:50
DR. ED JACOBS I wronged him or I broke up the family or… 

01:40:55
LESLIE Umm… A little of both, but umm… that I've also wronged God, because I took my vows very serious. 

01:41:00
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

01:41:00
LESLIE (inaudible ), you know, when we got married. 

01:41:05
DR. ED JACOBS Some of you that got divorced, was that a guilt thing about? It was… You're not (inaudible ). You felt guilty? 

01:41:16
EVY MCPHERSON Oh, definitely guilty, especially when there are children involved. 

01:41:16
LESLIE Yup. 

01:41:20
EVY MCPHERSON And giving up on something that you've worked really hard to keep together. 

01:41:25
MISTY Not only that, I felt like umm… like Leslie said, because I was raised in, you know, if you're good, you're going to heaven. If you're bad, you're going to hell. And so I felt like I was doing something bad. So I already felt like I was going to hell, you know… 

01:41:40
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Because divorce is bad? 

01:41:40
MISTY Yes. And even though everyone in my family has done it. Umm… It's just that belief that I had growing up, that my grandma instilled in me and you know, and my mom pretty much even though, you know, do as I say, not as I do. But it's, umm… and I have felt that way not in the last four years, because now I just know it's a belief that generations have passed down to their kids, their mom and you know, and it's just a vicious cycle. But now I believe, you know, that I am a good person. And, you know, wherever I go, it's my choice. 

01:42:20
DR. ED JACOBS Ivy, did you feel guilt when you divorced? 

01:42:20
IVY No. But I don't have that whole religious thing that's main a guilt trip on me. I stay away from that because I just don't like that. No, I didn't feel guilty. I felt like, I think for myself. If you stay in a relationship that's… 

01:42:35
DR. ED JACOBS This is your fourth marriage? 

01:42:35
IVY Right. 

01:42:35
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, okay. 

01:42:35
IVY I think for myself, if I were to stay in a relationship that is umm… bad for whatever reasons, that's not good for me, it's not good for the spouse, it's not good for the children. I think the… and this isn't true with everyone, so don't take it internally anyone. But all my life, I've heard this. Well, we stay together for the kids. Sometimes staying together for the kids is probably the worst thing you can do. 

01:43:00
EVY MCPHERSON Yeah, yeah. 

01:43:00
IVY So no, I didn't feel any… 

01:43:00
EVY MCPHERSON 100%. 

01:43:00
IVY …guilt in that sense. I'm sure I had some guilt because, you know, it's difficult to end a relationship with someone that you are that close to you. But no, I definitely didn't have guilt along that I was doing something wrong. 

01:43:15
DR. ED JACOBS You mentioned guilt? What was yours? 

01:43:15
STACY Mine wasn't the religious guilt umm… because I guess, with what my husband had done, it was the only thing that I could do. Umm… Now taking that back, I went back a few times umm… and there was some guilt there that I just went back. And… 

01:43:35
DR. ED JACOBS Guilt that… 'Cause I kept going back to him and going back to him and going back… 

01:43:40
STACY And the cycle just kept happening. 

01:43:40
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

01:43:40
STACY And just putting the kids through that again, and again, and again, and again. 

01:43:50
DR. ED JACOBS What did… Do guilt means you did a bad thing or did something wrong and… Yeah, you did this thing. You wish now you wouldn't have kept going back. 

01:44:05
STACY Oh, absolutely. 

01:44:10
DR. ED JACOBS Again, you forgive yourself for doing it or do you beat up on yourself? 

01:44:15
STACY Probably now, I have forgiven myself. It's been two and a half years since the last reconciliation. So, I've probably forgiven myself. Umm… But there's still that guilt for my kids I guess, that maybe I didn't make the best decision. And are they long-term affected or impacted by it? 

01:44:40
DR. ED JACOBS I guess that's the thing that I worry about more than anything. And I mean, here's the thing. Are any… is… are people walking around carrying… Yours is potential guilt, if you did leave, right? Is that what you're saying? If I left, I would feel guilty. Did you say guilt too? 

01:45:05
EVY MCPHERSON Yeah, well, I have guilt too because, you know, I feel, by divorcing my husband I… You know I've broken up the family unit and it's affecting my kids terribly. 

01:45:15
DR. ED JACOBS And why did you divorce? Or why are you getting divorced? 

01:45:20
EVY MCPHERSON Well, the infidelity reason and the lies and… and you know, hiding money and, but the affair more than anything and he's an alcoholic as well. Yeah, I just can't deal with it anymore. 

01:45:35
DR. ED JACOBS So, how is that wrong to have gotten divorced? What did you think about what Ivy said? 

01:45:40
EVY MCPHERSON I don't think that it's wrong. What I've done to move forward and take my life back, but the guilt is that watching my… watching my children suffer through the stages of… of the healing process of… of, you know, the unit falling, you know separating and falling apart, the family unit. 

01:46:00
MISTY Because you are healing and there're still falling apart? 

01:46:00
EVY MCPHERSON Well, because, yeah, because I'm trying to heal… I mean I'm trying to get, you know, be happy. And I'm watching them be unhappy right now, you know. And trying to guide them that this is a rough patch, we'll get through it and things will… you know things will be somewhat normal once we get through this, it's just a tough time right now, umm… yeah. 

01:46:25
DR. ED JACOBS I guess, yeah, do you have to feel… You feel it's unfortunate. What is… Yours was more… It's unfortunate, this thing is not working and I need to move on because it's no longer working, is that… 

01:46:40
IVY And because it's unhealthy for everyone involved. 

01:46:40
EVY MCPHERSON Right. 

01:46:45
IVY It's… I mean, yeah, I don't want to stay in an unhealthy… unhealthy for the children as well. It's unhealthy for everyone if you're in the situation that isn't… 

01:46:50
DR. ED JACOBS So, is it wrong what Stacy did to go back? Do you all understand how she went back? 

01:46:55
IVY I don't think that's wrong at all. 

01:46:55
EVY MCPHERSON No, I think Stacy was trying to, trying to fix it. And I don't think it's wrong and I shouldn't feel guilty, but I guess, I feel guilty because I… I would rather take the pain than my children feel the pain. And you are right by saying it's unhealthy to stay in it too. Maybe I stayed too long. Maybe I should have left sooner, you know, in the marriage. 

01:47:20
IVY That's how a individual (inaudible ) every situation is totally different. 

01:47:21
LESLIE Yeah. 

01:47:21
DR. ED JACOBS So… Ivy… Come up here, just a second. When you walked away from your marriage, did you reach down and take a bag of guilt or left it? You didn't? 

01:47:30
IVY I think I left it. 

01:47:30
DR. ED JACOBS You didn't carry? You didn't carry guilt? 

01:47:35
IVY Not to an extreme amount. 

01:47:35
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. And now you don't feel any guilt about the marriage? 

01:47:45
IVY I don't feel guilt about ending a marriage. 

01:47:45
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. Are you… Would you carry this as long as… Is that what you're gonna… You're gonna… You're gonna walk away from the marriage, but you're gonna carry the bag? 

01:48:00
EVY MCPHERSON No, I'm trying not to. 

01:48:00
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

01:48:00
EVY MCPHERSON I… I just, I'm hurting because my kids are hurting. So, maybe that's more hurt. 

01:48:05
DR. ED JACOBS That's a different sentence. 

01:48:05
EVY MCPHERSON Maybe it's hurt, instead of guilt. I felt guilty in the beginning because I initiated, even though it was a very, you know, it was a bad situation. And he wanted out, but wouldn't do it, didn't want to be the bad guy. You know, and I think he was trying to get out and then, you know, then the affair was revealed and then, you know… It was just… it was an unhealthy situation. 

01:48:25
DR. ED JACOBS Do you all understand hurting because her kids are hurting? If we sit in that seat… 

01:48:35
(inaudible) 

01:48:40
DR. ED JACOBS I should use it differently. But if you sit in that seat then… then life's confusing. And I feel like, because I don't know that you would take him back. I think you're done. 

01:48:55
STACY Oh, God, no. 

01:48:55
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. But when you would taking it back, you were more operating. 

01:49:00
STACY I was operating from that chair, in the sense that I enjoyed also having someone in my life. And he felt avoided. Umm… So, it's like, okay, I'll settle for this and take him back, because it's also my kid's dad. 

01:49:15
DR. ED JACOBS And he fed you some good lies. 

01:49:15
STACY Yeah. 

01:49:15
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, he was good. 

01:49:15
STACY Yeah. 

01:49:20
DR. ED JACOBS And I'll change, right. And I am changed as your… 

01:49:20
LESLIE Yeah. 

01:49:25
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

01:49:25
LESLIE Yeah. 

01:49:25
DR. ED JACOBS I don't know if your husband ever said that. 

01:49:25
EVY MCPHERSON Oh, no, he doesn't do any wrong. So, he would never admit to it even if he did. Yeah, mine would never admit to being in the wrong, you know… 

01:49:35
STACY Yeah. 

01:49:35
ASRA It's always someone else's fault. 

01:49:40
DR. ED JACOBS How can we help in terms of… of… of guilt? To where… What would it be like to walk and you… you did… you live and you make mistakes and you learn from them and you try this, then you do that and you do that, that's very different than sitting in that seat and thinking, oh, God, you know, and you know, you do something and then you feel bad and you're all locked into that seat. 

01:50:10
SHIRLEY I don't think we know we sit in this seat… 

01:50:10
EVY MCPHERSON Sometimes. 

01:50:10
SHIRLEY As often as what we do, at least, I don't. 

01:50:10
EVY MCPHERSON Yeah. 

01:50:15
STACY I feel like I'm less and less in the seat as where are the seats, these seats aren't meant in my life or whatever. I feel like I'm less and less in this seat. I try to be more, think about long term, I guess, maybe it can be, and not adult self or so. 

01:50:35
ASRA I think it could help by umm… identifying what does, umm… sitting in the adult seat look like, you know, 'cause like you said, I don't think you know sometimes how you're being influenced by guilt or shame or things that are not so healthy. And… And you'd like Leslie, you know, you just, okay, how do I, what does it look like to be in that, like what kind of life choices does that mean, what does the ride look like? 

01:51:05
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

01:51:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Watch how the two new members seem comfortable and engaged. Also note how the leader gets them to share. When new members enter a group, the leader should focus on the current members and let the new members ease into the group. A common mistake is to focus on the new members by either telling them all that's happened in the previous sessions or to try to get the new members to share when he or she is not yet comfortable. Anytime there is a new member, the leader needs to pay attention to how the new person is adapting to being in the group and how the current members are relating to the new member. In this case, the new members seem comfortable and engaged. And the current member seem comfortable with the new members. 

01:51:50
DR. ED JACOBS What did you mean, Shirley, when you sit there? 

01:51:55
SHIRLEY Because I've sat there a lot, but I didn't know. 

01:51:55
DR. ED JACOBS Right. 

01:51:55
SHIRLEY That I was in that little girl's seat. It's… It's hard sitting in the adult chair, 'cause the major decisions are different and your thoughts are different and the whole way you live your life is different. It's real easy to sit there and think you're making really good decisions, because in my mind they work. 

01:52:15
MISTY Right. 

01:52:15
SHIRLEY But really… 

01:52:20
DR. ED JACOBS But the limits you… 

01:52:20
SHIRLEY When you sit over here, they limit you. 

01:52:20
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

01:52:20
SHIRLEY And they don't make you think in a rational manner like I'm capable of thinking, this one's limited that. I didn't know that at the time and some days I still don't you know it and some days I still sit there, because it's easy and safe. 

01:52:40
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL And familiar. 

01:52:40
SHIRLEY It is familiar. 

01:52:40
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Earlier the word came up, that it's familiar. 

01:52:45
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. It's not easier. It's…. 

01:52:50
MISTY I say it's easier sitting over girl's chair. Well just because it's our… 

01:52:50
STACY Some days, it's easier sitting there. 

01:52:50
MISTY Well, just because it's a… 

01:52:55
ASRA I think, it's automatic, that's why 

01:52:55
MISTY Yeah, not getting out of our comfort zone, that's comfortable to us, that's where we like to be… 

01:53:00
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, it's easier to, yeah, just do like that way… 

01:53:00
MISTY It is. 

01:53:05
DR. ED JACOBS Not take the shower and you know… 

01:53:05
MISTY Yeah, you can't, you're never basically hold accountable for anything and umm… it's just easier and comfortable sitting in that chair, you know, as an adult chair, you have to be responsible. 

01:53:20
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I guess you have to think through your next move, right? 

01:53:20
MISTY Yeah. 

01:53:20
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL You got to think, what is the appropriate next move? 

01:53:25
SHIRLEY And it's harder to do that. 

01:53:25
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Uh-uh. 

01:53:25
SHIRLEY As a little girl, it's okay, I'm good. 

01:53:30
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yeah. 

01:53:30
SHIRLEY But as an adult, you know, it's like… 

01:53:35
DR. ED JACOBS I… I think, here… here would be the question, how much do you want to get out of your life, you know, all of us have another 25, 30, 40 years, what do you want to get? What do you want to get out of your life on this earth? And are you doing it? And does that seat get you what you want out of your life? 

01:54:00
RUTH That she that, I mean, that seat, that seat is just short term satisfaction, that's what it is. So, that one is not doing something that you really want to do right now because it's going to mess something up or it's not going to benefit your future. 

01:54:20
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. This one… But does that make sense, am I getting as much out of life? And I know you're struggling with that some of sitting in this seat versus that seat. 

01:54:35
SHIRLEY This seat is scary. 

01:54:35
DR. ED JACOBS This seat? 

01:54:35
SHIRLEY Yeah, the big seat is scary. 

01:54:40
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, Leslie, I'm pointing at Leslie. 

01:54:40
SHIRLEY To me? 

01:54:40
LESLIE I am Leslie. 

01:54:40
SHIRLEY Oh, I'm sorry. 

01:54:45
DR. ED JACOBS No, no, she worked on that. Go ahead, keep going. 

01:54:45
SHIRLEY It's… It's scary, because this one is safe and if you make a wrong decision, it's okay, I'm in the chair and it's… 

01:54:55
DR. ED JACOBS You know what's gonna happen, like in Leslie, she can stay in her bad marriage, yours, you can avoid. I mean, I'm gonna share a little bit. Shirley's husband died five years ago and then she's met this guy and it's just scaring the crap out of her right man. Is that a good way to say? 

01:55:15
SHIRLEY Yeah, that's a good way to say. But I still… I still carry guilt and it's… umm… 

01:55:20
DR. ED JACOBS Guilt. Say some more about that. 

01:55:20
SHIRLEY And I know it's not wrong. 

01:55:20
DR. ED JACOBS But what… 

01:55:25
SHIRLEY But it's… 

01:55:25
DR. ED JACOBS I'm guilty… 

01:55:25
IVY For moving on? 

01:55:25
SHIRLEY Yeah, partly. 

01:55:30
IVY Okay. 

01:55:30
SHIRLEY Umm… Because I've had a really hard five years, right, and I cry, I said I've had a really… 

01:55:35
DR. ED JACOBS You've got a (inaudible ). 

01:55:38
LESLIE You're shitting in the good area. 

01:55:40
SHIRLEY I have. 

01:55:40
LESLIE You have some. 

01:55:40
SHIRLEY I always come equipped when I go to Ed's. It's been hard, I don't know what the guilt is about spending time with this other guy, only that I do feel it, it's getting better. But, I do feel it and in the beginning, I felt like it was very wrong to enjoy myself again. 

01:56:00
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. We're gonna try something. Ask her what's wrong just this phrase, what's wrong with spending time with this guy? Go ahead. 

01:56:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Uh… Let me tweak it a little bit. 

01:56:05
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

01:56:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL What are you doing wrong, by spending time with this guy, make it that? 

01:56:10
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. I'd ask that and you're gonna answer, then somebody else is gonna ask you the same question. 

01:56:15
LESLIE What are you doing wrong by spending time with this guy? 

01:56:20
SHIRLEY I'm not doing anything wrong. The guilt of me, what I feel guilty about is because my husband is not here to do it and have… and enjoy himself. Now how I arrived of that being guilt, I'm not sure. But, I'm getting less and less about that. But… yeah, I've… part of me feels guilty because I'm still… we're not having a good time. And I'm enjoying the friendship of this guy and I've never been out, in five and a half years I've never been out with anybody. So it's… 

01:56:55
DR. ED JACOBS Does it seem like she is doing something wrong? 

01:56:55
RUTH No. 

01:57:00
IVY No. Not at all. 

01:57:00
EVY MCPHERSON She is… She is moving on this life, that's what she is doing. 

01:57:00
DR. ED JACOBS Do you think that… 

01:57:05
EVY MCPHERSON She is living. She is living, something that we talked about. 

01:57:05
IVY Something you're supposed to live, you're supposed to live on. 

01:57:10
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Evy, ask her what the alternative is? 

01:57:15
EVY MCPHERSON Yeah, what is the alternative, if you're not living? 

01:57:15
SHIRLEY To do what I've been doing in the past five and a half years. I mean, I've had, I've had fun with my family and… and friends, but this doesn't include them and so… 

01:57:30
IVY So, this is just for you? 

01:57:30
SHIRLEY Yes. 

01:57:30
IVY That's an okay thing now. 

01:57:35
SHIRLEY Well, that I haven't, I mean, that's it. I'm beginning to realize that. It's just taking me while put that all together. 

01:57:40
EVY MCPHERSON Sounds like it scares the crap out of… 

01:57:40
SHIRLEY Yeah, it does scare the crap out of me. I was married for 38 years and that's it, that's all I know. 

01:57:50
EVY MCPHERSON You don't know anything else? 

01:57:50
SHIRLEY No. I went from living with my parents, to living with him and raising the family and for five and a half years, I lived by myself. 

01:58:00
EVY MCPHERSON Which is scary… 

01:58:00
SHIRLEY In and of itself to, finally I'm in charge of my own life. 

01:58:05
DR. ED JACOBS Well, what's the question you might want to ask her, I think, you, sort of, got the picture? 

01:58:10
MISTY Do you worry about your family not thinking you're grieving long enough? 

01:58:15
SHIRLEY Umm… no, I think, they think I've grieved plenty. I worry… I don't worry like about my mother or sister. I worry more about my children and them thinking it's okay to see me with somebody else, because it's different, because they never have, but… 

01:58:30
DR. ED JACOBS And what's their reaction then? 

01:58:30
SHIRLEY I mean that, it's been okay. I haven't had any negative feedback, but they haven't been around this guy a lot, but, umm… I mean, I guess they seem okay, but you know what I've said to them, I'm… I don't need your approval, I want your opinion, but I don't need your approval. 

01:58:50
IVY Good. 

01:58:50
MISTY Do you mean that? Do you, do you mean… I mean, do you want their blessing, approvals all the same thing basically. 

01:59:00
SHIRLEY I do mean it. Because I do mean it, yeah, I do mean it. I'm went away with this guy for a couple of days and I told my son I was going and it was a long pause. And he like, I don't want to say that, mom. And I said, just tell me to go and have a good time. But I want you to mean it. And he did. I said okay. I worry more about him than I do my daughter. 

01:59:20
IVY Do you feel like you need to ask them? I mean, are they… 

01:59:20
SHIRLEY No, I don't need to ask them. And… And he said I don't know what to say. And I said I don't need your approval. I just want you to know what I'm doing and I'm not gonna hide anything from you. 

01:59:30
DR. ED JACOBS What would be helpful in this area? Let's say you came here for these couple of hours, and you spent 15 minutes talking here and you left, drove home and said, boy that was helpful. What… What… What is the question that you have that you could pose to the group, is it wrong or whatever… 

01:59:55
SHIRLEY I know… I know, it's not wrong. In my heart, I know it's not wrong. 

01:59:55
DR. ED JACOBS Okay, so, what… what… what… 

02:00:00
SHIRLEY But it's just allowing myself. Yeah, but it's allowing myself to really feel good about it, and now that it's okay, 'cause he is a great guy, but the whole situation is so different. 

02:00:10
MISTY So you're trying to get approval by yourself, for yourself? 

02:00:15
SHIRLEY I don't need… I guess it's my… 

02:00:15
MISTY You had an approval. 

02:00:20
SHIRLEY I guess. 

02:00:20
ASRA Do you feel like you're betraying your husband? 

02:00:25
SHIRLEY In the beginning, I did. In the beginning, that's where I felt guilty, but I've done, I mean, that's what totally subsiding, but some days, I still have really bad days. 

02:00:35
IVY Is it just because it's so different maybe? 

02:00:35
SHIRLEY Probably. 

02:00:40
ASRA Do you still maybe grieve your husband? 

02:00:40
SHIRLEY Some… 

02:00:40
ASRA And miss him? 

02:00:45
SHIRLEY Put it someplace, so it's not in my everyday life so much. 

02:00:55
DR. ED JACOBS What would be helpful? Is it wrong that you're dating this guy? 

02:01:05
SHIRLEY No. 

02:01:05
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

02:01:05
SHIRLEY And I don't use that word ever. 

02:01:05
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. Do you ever… 

02:01:10
SHIRLEY No, we're doing each other's… 

02:01:10
MISTY Hanging out. 

02:01:10
SHIRLEY Yeah. 

02:01:10
MISTY Yeah, hanging out. 

02:01:15
LESLIE Hooking up. 

02:01:15
EVY MCPHERSON Hooking up. 

02:01:15
SHIRLEY No. 

02:01:20
(inaudible)(crosstalk) 

02:01:25
EVY MCPHERSON You missed that one, Ed. 

02:01:25
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, go ahead. 

02:01:25
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Can I try to do this? I don't know. 

02:01:30
DR. ED JACOBS Sure, try. 

02:01:30
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL What was your husband's name? 

02:01:35
SHIRLEY Bill. 

02:01:40
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL This may get us somewhere or may not. 

02:01:40
SHIRLEY Okay. 

02:01:40
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I don't know, but we'll try and see it, right. 

02:01:40
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

02:01:45
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Okay. So you take that and have you done this before? 

02:01:50
SHIRLEY Uh… Have I, Ed? 

02:01:50
DR. ED JACOBS I don't think. 

02:01:50
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Take Bill, like this and put it right in front of you. 

02:01:55
SHIRLEY Okay. 

02:02:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL That's, kind of, what you're doing, I think, like you can't let yourself see beyond that a little bit, because that would be wrong or that would be too hard or I don't know, put it… put it right back up there, Shirley. 

02:02:20
ASRA Let's say closer. 

02:02:20
SHIRLEY You know, Bill is safe and… and I am… I know he is secure. And it's safe for me because I know him. This is stepping out of my comfort zone… 

02:02:30
DR. ED JACOBS And this caused into the confidence thing. 

02:02:35
SHIRLEY Yeah, and getting to know somebody. And it's just way different. 

02:02:40
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Anytime the member cries, it gets the attention of the group. In these situations the leader has to make decisions as to how to handle the crying member. Watch how in this segment, coming up, one member reaches over to comfort the crying member which in this case seemed appropriate. There are times when comforting a crying member is very appropriate and times when it is not. It is not appropriate when the person is crying for attention or as a way to avoid work that they need to do. The tendency is to comfort someone who is crying. But leaders want to make sure to not do this when the crying is keeping the member from working on his or her issues or when that member is feeling sorry for themselves. 

02:03:25
DR. ED JACOBS Are you, have holding on to Bill, it's different if you're grieving and all that, but certainly you've done that for the last five years. Or is it just safe and you're afraid that if I don't… that I could get out there with this new guy and that's scary to me because I don't… 

02:03:45
SHIRLEY It's… It is scary to me, it's meeting somebody new. How do… and… It's not as safe, it's not as safe. Yeah, it's just not as safe. And although he is great and he makes me feel safe, but I don't know where this is gonna go and or how long it's gonna last or… 

02:04:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Bill won't breakup with you? 

02:04:10
SHIRLEY No, you're right. He won't. 

02:04:10
DR. ED JACOBS Is that what you're worried about? 

02:04:15
SHIRLEY Oh, I don't know. I… I… I… 

02:04:15
MISTY But not dating. 

02:04:20
EVY MCPHERSON Take it a day… Take it a day out of the time. Seriously, take it a day out of time. 

02:04:20
SHIRLEY Exactly, I mean, I have a really good time with this guy and… 

02:04:25
STACY Are you afraid of your hand and you're worried how you're gonna do, how you're gonna handle it? 

02:04:30
SHIRLEY Yeah, and I'll tell you what, I told you this that I thought it would be okay, because I knew my husband will sit and I thought I would be okay, but then he wasn't, he wasn't okay. 

02:04:40
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

02:04:45
SHIRLEY Oh, it's… it's, yeah, I worry about that. 

02:04:50
DR. ED JACOBS That you're gonna fall apart again, you made it, you survived. 

02:04:55
SHIRLEY I know. 

02:04:55
DR. ED JACOBS Right. 

02:04:55
SHIRLEY But look at me, I'm five years… 

02:04:55
DR. ED JACOBS But you've gotten in a whole lot stronger… 

02:05:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Is it your… just trying to clarify. 

02:05:00
SHIRLEY Sure. 

02:05:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Your fear that, that you, that this relationship won't last or the fear of connecting to another man who might get sick and die? 

02:05:15
SHIRLEY Well, I think about that too. But I know, that, that's hard, that's hard, because we're all going to and it could be me first and… 

02:05:25
DR. ED JACOBS Do you want to add anything? I mean, because this is her niece, so she knows her real well. 

02:05:35
Here the leader draws out member who he believes may have some helpful feedback, since she knows the working member well. 

02:05:35
SHIRLEY Umm… Just say it. 

02:05:40
STACY Yeah. There is a lot I could say, but I watched her, umm… over the last five and a half years and I've seen her grow, umm… and I've met this guy and he is awesome and I tried to, you know, take her, focus her back to that and you know, I do talk about my uncle some, but she needs… she needs to live, she needs to be happy and she hasn't been living for the last five years. She is just been… 

02:06:15
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Grieving. 

02:06:15
STACY …grieving. She's just been… 

02:06:15
EVY MCPHERSON Existing. 

02:06:15
STACY Yeah. And now she is happy. She smiles. 

02:06:25
[sil.] 

02:06:30
EVY MCPHERSON Blushes even may be. 

02:06:30
DR. ED JACOBS But… But here is the saddest thing to me is this. Misty, stand up here. So, we're gonna hug. But this could be you and this could be this guy, but instead it's… 

02:06:50
MISTY You have this. 

02:06:55
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. You know, you won't embrace it completely and you could, this feels a whole lot better than this, right, does this feel, I mean, this is okay? 

02:07:05
SHIRLEY Yeah, this is awkward. 

02:07:05
MISTY You, you know. 

02:07:10
SHIRLEY I'm getting, I'm getting better. 

02:07:10
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL That's in the middle. 

02:07:10
MISTY Yeah, that's the truth. 

02:07:15
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Right there. 

02:07:15
IVY Each person grieves. 

02:07:15
SHIRLEY I know that five and a half years is way long time. 

02:07:20
DR. ED JACOBS Is there anything we could do the help or is this helping… 

02:07:25
SHIRLEY You're helping, you're helping. I mean, really you're helping, just encouraging me, helpful. 

02:07:25
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. Yeah, okay. But it has to do with self-confidence. Let's go to that topic. What… What did you all want to discuss, talk about the confidence thing, because there are three or four… 

02:07:40
SHIRLEY But I have, but I've… 

02:07:40
DR. ED JACOBS Go ahead. 

02:07:45
SHIRLEY I have confidence, but… and I second guess myself a lot, but what I found out about myself is the words of affirmation, that somebody gives me back, makes my confidence sore, way… way big. 

02:07:55
LESLIE Yeah. 

02:08:00
SHIRLEY It an assurance for me that I'm… (inaudible ). 

02:08:05
IVY Uh… It's not me, either my mom does it to me, every time…. 

02:08:05
STACY I don't believe it. 

02:08:05
IVY So, I react to it. 

02:08:10
DR. ED JACOBS This is the why that book the Five Love Language is such a good book, because the words… 

02:08:10
SHIRLEY I read that book. That's where that came from, I read that book. 

02:08:15
IVY Interesting. 

02:08:15
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, right. Yeah. So, words about affirmation, so if this guy gives you words of affirmation that helps? 

02:08:20
SHIRLEY He does. He does, absolutely. 

02:08:25
DR. ED JACOBS But then you need more. 

02:08:25
SHIRLEY Not that, no, not necessarily more. But I find that I do better when I, somebody gives me that good feedback. 

02:08:35
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL So what if somebody, here is the question when somebody is not giving you good feedback? 

02:08:40
SHIRLEY Well, I consider the person. 

02:08:40
MISTY When do you get that on yourself? 

02:08:40
IVY That's a healthy answer. 

02:08:45
SHIRLEY I consider the source and think, okay, they're an idiot, I don't care. 

02:08:50
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Watch other leaders facilitate the discussion regarding self-confidence. In order to be an effective group leader the leaders needs to know effective intervention for any concept which may come up in a group, that is leaders need to have good information, good ideas and good interventions that will go with topics such as anger, guilt, self-confidence and worry. The leader needs to be able to use counseling theories to help members with these and another issues. The leader should have one or more theories that he or she uses to help with discussion of these topics. Note the comments of the leader in regards to self-confidence. Also note the use of voice on the part of the leaders. 

02:09:30
DR. ED JACOBS So, let's go back to confidence. Who… You mentioned confidence, didn't you? 

02:09:35
EVY MCPHERSON I did. Yeah, and I have, I have two questions and it's how do we… how do we get it if we'd never had it and how do you rebuild it if you had it and…? 

02:09:45
DR. ED JACOBS Okay Don't look at me. 

02:09:50
MISTY Don't look at me. 

02:09:50
DR. ED JACOBS All right. (inaudible ). 

02:09:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Everybody is looking at you. 

02:09:55
EVY MCPHERSON Well, it seems like a lot of our problems revolve around self-confidence and… 

02:10:00
MISTY Yeah, I agree. 

02:10:05
DR. ED JACOBS In a simple way to say it, it's believing that I'm okay. I know I'm not perfect, I don't have to be perfect, but I'm okay and unlikable. And if you're not do something bad, and I know, you've cleaned up a lot of your stuff to where you like yourself better. And that's the thing, whereas you've got to believe, yeah, and if it comes from external people only, then it's a mess. I guess what you were asking, see. So, the way you build it is to believe I'm okay and that's the thing to think about it. 

02:10:45
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL And that… And that is not tied to anything. I'm okay, if my kids are okay. 

02:10:50
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

02:10:50
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I'm okay if I make enough money. I'm okay if… 

02:10:55
DR. ED JACOBS I'm married. 

02:10:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Married. Yeah, it's not, it's not, it's just I'm okay, period. 

02:11:00
EVY MCPHERSON Starts with yourself here. 

02:11:05
DR. ED JACOBS And if you don't believe it, it go deep down 'cause I know, I did this session over the phone, uh… Saturday morning with this woman. And she feels… like she said, I'm bad and hers was because of the stuff she did when she was in college. She did a whole bunch of stuff that she regrets. But that, see… So, the question you got to believe and if your mother told you, you weren't gonna amount anything unless that you grew up, believing you're white trash, you know. So, what is it, what is, what do you mean, 'cause you said you wanted to talk about confidence and I think you (inaudible ). What are you thinking, Stacy is your, here in this. What… What is confidence in your mind? 

02:11:55
STACY Umm… I don't know, umm… I don't know. 

02:12:00
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

02:12:00
STACY I mean, I struggle with that daily, I mean, if somebody… 

02:12:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Do you even… Do you even know what it is or… 

02:12:10
STACY Yeah. Umm… Somebody pays me a compliment, I'm like, I don't want to hear it. I don't believe it, why are you saying it? And yeah, uh… like you're feeling like you have to say it? 

02:12:25
DR. ED JACOBS Do you believe you're a good deal? That's the thing. Do you believe you're a good deal? 

02:12:35
SHIRLEY Sometimes. 

02:12:35
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

02:12:35
MISTY I try to convince myself that I am. 

02:12:35
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

02:12:35
MISTY But just like she said I feel like I don't need validation. But even if I… and when I do get it, it's just like, well I don't believe it anyway. But I'm so like good at moving on and not even… 

02:12:50
DR. ED JACOBS Where are you on that, 'cause as far as feeling good about yourself? 

02:12:55
RUTH Uh… I'm, I just try to limit the times I beat myself up and that has made me feel a lot better about myself. I do feel good and I think I project that to people a lot more now than what I did. 

02:13:10
DR. ED JACOBS Because before you didn't feel good, you could go out and drink 'cause that's where the alcohol and the drugs. If you don't feel good you got to medicate it somehow, neither get man or get people to tag you or do something. 

02:13:25
RUTH And I noticed, just I like told you, my sister was changing or putting tons of pictures, or pictures on Facebook all the time. 

02:13:30
DR. ED JACOBS I'm just getting you to look around. 

02:13:30
RUTH Okay. And… And I… And I used to do that too. And I realized, it's was 'cause I was fishing for compliments, I wanted people to tell me I was pretty. I wanted them to give me that reassurance and I don't change my picture anymore, I don't care, I don't even pay that much attention to any of it anymore, because I feel good on the inside and I don't need somebody to tell me. 

02:13:50
MISTY Yeah, I think we're… we are our own worst judge. And, umm… we're harder on ourselves than anyone else than our ex-husbands or husband's kids. And, you know, and we don't forgive ourselves. 

02:14:05
DR. ED JACOBS We, except Ivy is not hard of herself, Asra is not that hard on herself. Why is that? How did that happen? 

02:14:10
LESLIE Yeah, how did you get there? 

02:14:15
DR. ED JACOBS How did… How did, there is people here and you're, sort of, in between there, you… you used to be hard as hell on yourself. So, how does that happen? 

02:14:20
IVY It takes so much energy… 

02:14:25
DR. ED JACOBS To what? 

02:14:25
IVY …to be hard on yourself, it's easier to not be. 

02:14:30
DR. ED JACOBS Well, I don't know what these people… it's familiar, right. You used to being hard on yourself. 

02:14:35
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL How do you think you got there, though. I guess, that's if we could put our finger… 

02:14:35
IVY I don't know, because I had a horrible, horrible childhood. I mean, I, horrible, but… 

02:14:40
DR. ED JACOBS (inaudible ). 

02:14:45
IVY But it's like people would always say, oh, how did you get to that, well, what's your alternative, to be… be in the gutter and cry? I mean, you don't an alternative, this is it, you do the best with what you got and make the best of what you can, for yourself, your family, people around you. We're all of the same species for each other. 

02:15:05
DR. ED JACOBS Chris, take that seat. Pull it, pull it over all here, just… 

02:15:05
IVY I guess I'm little hard on that, I didn't mean to be. 

02:15:10
[sil.] 

02:15:15
Leaders dramatize the Adult and Child ego states (from Transactional Analysis) in regards to confidence. Note how this technique facilitates engagement. 

02:15:15
DR. ED JACOBS And you say what you… Your purpose is to stay safe and all that kind of… What's your purpose? My purpose in life is to enjoy my life, and to try to get the most out of it. 

02:15:25
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL My purpose is, umm… I don't know, just be invested in what other people think of me, umm… try to please people to get my sense of self, uh… 

02:15:45
[sil.] 

02:15:50
DR. ED JACOBS I don't mind taking a risk. 

02:15:50
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Well, I'm not gonna take a risk. 

02:15:55
IVY I should, that's me. 

02:15:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I believe, if you have to. 

02:15:55
DR. ED JACOBS What? 

02:16:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I'm not gonna do that. 

02:16:00
DR. ED JACOBS I want to get as you… 

02:16:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I might fail. 

02:16:05
DR. ED JACOBS So what? 

02:16:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL That would be terrible. So what? Failing would be terrible. You know what people say about you when you fail? 

02:16:15
DR. ED JACOBS I want to get this. 

02:16:15
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL You know people think of you when you fail? 

02:16:15
DR. ED JACOBS I don't care what they think, it's what I think. 

02:16:15
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I do. I care. 

02:16:20
DR. ED JACOBS No, I… I want to… the thing I want is peace in my life and I want enjoyment in my life, that's what I want. Don't you want that? 

02:16:40
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Umm… Am I suppose to say yes? 

02:16:45
DR. ED JACOBS Well, it's… I mean, I want to enjoy, I want to enjoy life. 

02:16:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Life is hard. I mean, life is really, really, really hard. I mean, my life is really hard. 

02:17:00
DR. ED JACOBS But it doesn't have to be. I want to sit in this seat, think, get support from these fine people that I've met today, from other people. 

02:17:10
DR. ED JACOBS But you're… you don't… you don't want to grow, safety is what's important to you and familiar. 

02:17:20
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL In knowing that people think I'm okay. 

02:17:20
DR. ED JACOBS Is this helpful? What is this… What is this doing for someone? 

02:17:25
STACY I don't know, but I'm there all the time. 

02:17:30
ASRA Yeah. 

02:17:30
DR. ED JACOBS Huh? 

02:17:30
STACY it's true. 

02:17:30
DR. ED JACOBS Have you there a lot? 

02:17:30
STACY A lot. 

02:17:35
EVY MCPHERSON You're not living by worrying, are we? 

02:17:40
DR. ED JACOBS Uh… no. 

02:17:40
STACY No. 

02:17:40
DR. ED JACOBS But you could sit here and play this. 

02:17:40
IVY I'm here, I, everything you said, yes. 

02:17:45
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

02:17:45
IVY That doesn't make me heartless, does it? 

02:17:45
DR. ED JACOBS No, no. 

02:17:45
LESLIE No, no. 

02:17:45
IVY Okay. 

02:17:50
STACY You're confident. 

02:17:50
DR. ED JACOBS And you're trying to get… you understand that thing, and Evy, you and I touched on this last time. 

02:17:55
SHIRLEY Did you miss it in that at all? 

02:18:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL That's a good question, ask that a little louder. 

02:18:00
DR. ED JACOBS Say that out loud. 

02:18:00
SHIRLEY Did you always sit in that adult seat? 

02:18:05
DR. ED JACOBS (inaudible ) 

02:18:06
IVY Yes, and no. Well, yes and no. No, but yes. Does that make sense? 

02:18:10
DR. ED JACOBS Well… 

02:18:10
SHIRLEY Not to me. 

02:18:15
DR. ED JACOBS Well, let's go to other people. What did this doing this do for you, what did it… 

02:18:20
LESLIE I want to sit in a big girl seat. 

02:18:20
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

02:18:25
LESLIE All the time. 

02:18:25
DR. ED JACOBS Well, it's possible, it's possible. 

02:18:30
MISTY I sit in a big girl seat when it comes to other people, when it comes to myself and then the little girl seat. Umm… I'm great at telling how people… telling people how to live their life. 

02:18:40
STACY You know, how to live well, right? 

02:18:45
MISTY Yeah, I'm damn good at it. And just living my life, I'm getting better at it, but, umm… you know, I still, safety is my first, umm… priority still. So, it's hard for me to jump back and forth. Okay. 

02:19:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Let me… Can I share something with you this… 

02:19:00
MISTY Yeah. 

02:19:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I don't know, maybe this helps, maybe it's a waste of our time. But I'll share this with you. So, I have this adult client that I'm working with right now and she couldn't be here today although she, I think, oh, I wish she were here, 'cause she could really benefit from this, but some of you work with it, you know, this idea of the cup, right. When you are talking about confidence, where does confidence come from, well confidence is someone pours in my cup or right in it and if the cup has a hole what happens. It fills, you fill full. So, I was doing this with my client and I said I want to you to take this cup home and think about all the holes in your cup, right. And so, she brings it back with all these holes. 

02:19:40
MISTY That's right. Yeah. 

02:19:45
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Right. I'm not pretty enough, umm… not confident, not good enough at my job, not good enough… I'm not a good enough Christian, I have poor social… there are all these non… there are all these not enough stuff on here, right. 

02:20:00
MISTY Yeah. 

02:20:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL And I… I… So, we're gonna… It's gonna take us months to go through each and every one of these and for me to dispute them, let's look at this a little deeper and that I think is what Ed is saying to you right now. We ended up looking at what is the message that you got from the time you were born until the time you started working with me, right. What is the message you got? And I think that's what, maybe each of you have to figure out, is what was the message. And for her the message was if you're not the best at everything you do, then you're not okay. So, it's hard to go out in the world and be the best Christian, the best sexiest person, the best person in bed that always the smartest, right. I mean, that's hard to live up to. 

02:20:45
DR. ED JACOBS And that… that she… she did that cup? 

02:20:45
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL She… Yeah, she did, this is her cup, her writing, yeah. And that's what we had to get to. We have to stop and really search ourselves and say, what was that… search with, I searched with her, what was that message until we got down to it. And that was her message that if you weren't the best at everything you did then you were not enough. 

02:21:05
IVY Yeah. 

02:21:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL That's hard to live an adult life with that message, right? 

02:21:10
[sil.] 

02:21:15
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL And so now, you know, it's getting her and I keep thinking this is well, like that seat is unconscious incompetence, right. You're just moving through the world scared and you don't know, why. But once you understand that message you grew up with, you at least start to move to consciously incompetent. 

02:21:30
DR. ED JACOBS That had a big impact on you when we were doing that. You want to share any part of that or not? 

02:21:40
STACY I mean, I just, I'm very good at giving off the image that I have self-confidence, but sitting here with that was what everything you were saying and it comes, right, I mean, I don't know exactly what comes from, it comes from my dad, growing up, that my brother was always the best. And you're a girl, whatever, I don't have time for you. 

02:22:05
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

02:22:05
STACY Umm… 

02:22:05
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

02:22:10
STACY And that has impacted a lot. Then, you know, my marriage. Umm… I went from one to the other. 

02:22:15
DR. ED JACOBS Yes. Somebody telling you you're not enough, and you don't matter. 

02:22:20
STACY Right, right. 

02:22:20
ASRA We chose the same kind of husband that married… that message. 

02:22:25
STACY Exactly, yeah. I mean, I'm better, but I still, how long did you go? 

02:22:30
DR. ED JACOBS But… But don't give up until you get here, and work hard to get here and what you did or in the second segment where you got up and at least moved over here. And that's it, and try to get to this seat, believe me, and it just, then 'cause you think consciously that's the difference. 

02:22:55
STACY Well, what's the first step to take? I guess to get to that seat, you know, there is a lot of us that seem to be right here, a lot of the time. What is that first step you take to get to that seat? Is that you… 

02:23:05
IVY Was that when she got up and walked over to it, maybe. Something (inaudible )? 

02:23:12
EVY MCPHERSON You have to want to be over that, I think, you have to want to do. 

02:23:15
MISTY I can say when Leslie did that it, it was very, umm… impairing for me, because I saw how impairing it was for her just to take that deep breath of relief that that's the first step and you know, it's just… 

02:23:30
DR. ED JACOBS Let… Let… I'm just gonna try this and we'll start with you, but we're gonna to do it with everybody or we'll do it with the people that feel like they're… I want you to say I'm okay to her, to Misty and then you're gonna say it to everybody here. Just that phrase I'm okay. And then you say, yes, you're. That's your line. 

02:23:50
STACY Oh! Seriously, I can't be that. 

02:23:55
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

02:23:55
SHIRLEY I'll start. 

02:23:55
DR. ED JACOBS You can't do it? 

02:24:00
STACY Because I know that. I mean, I… 

02:24:00
MISTY You have to believe it, that's the whole thing. 

02:24:00
DR. ED JACOBS Okay, Misty you do it. You try it. 

02:24:05
MISTY Okay. 

02:24:05
DR. ED JACOBS Say it. 

02:24:05
MISTY I'm okay. 

02:24:05
ASRA You are. Absolutely very much okay. 

02:24:10
DR. ED JACOBS Good. 

02:24:10
MISTY Thank you. 

02:24:10
ASRA I'm okay. 

02:24:10
DR. ED JACOBS No, no, no, she says it. She say it. We are going around. 

02:24:15
MISTY Oh, I'm okay. 

02:24:15
RUTH Yes, you are. 

02:24:15
MISTY I'm okay. 

02:24:15
EVY MCPHERSON Yes. I agree, you are. 

02:24:20
MISTY I'm okay. 

02:24:20
LESLIE Yes, you are. 

02:24:20
MISTY I'm okay. 

02:24:25
SHIRLEY Yes, you are, good for you. 

02:24:25
MISTY I'm okay. 

02:24:25
IVY Yes, you are. 

02:24:25
MISTY I'm okay. 

02:24:30
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yes, you are. 

02:24:30
MISTY I'm okay. 

02:24:30
STACY Yes, you are. 

02:24:30
MISTY Okay. 

02:24:35
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. Could you do that? You could do it. 

02:24:35
ASRA Uh-huh. 

02:24:35
DR. ED JACOBS Right. Can you do it? 

02:24:35
RUTH Uh-huh. 

02:24:40
DR. ED JACOBS I want you to do it. 

02:24:40
EVY MCPHERSON Me? 

02:24:40
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

02:24:40
EVY MCPHERSON Okay. 

02:24:45
DR. ED JACOBS Start with her. 

02:24:45
EVY MCPHERSON I'm okay. 

02:24:45
LESLIE Yes, you are. 

02:24:45
EVY MCPHERSON I'm okay. 

02:24:50
SHIRLEY Yes, you are. 

02:24:50
EVY MCPHERSON I'm okay. 

02:24:50
IVY Yes, you are. 

02:24:50
EVY MCPHERSON I'm okay. 

02:24:50
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yes, you are. 

02:24:55
EVY MCPHERSON I'm okay. 

02:24:55
STACY Yes, you are. 

02:24:55
EVY MCPHERSON I'm okay. 

02:25:00
MISTY Yes, you are. 

02:25:00
EVY MCPHERSON I'm okay. 

02:25:00
ASRA You're awesome. 

02:25:00
EVY MCPHERSON I'm okay. 

02:25:00
RUTH Yes, you are. 

02:25:05
DR. ED JACOBS What was that line? 

02:25:05
EVY MCPHERSON It was reassuring, it was moving. Brought tears to my eyes 'cause I know deep down, I am. I just have to convince myself I am. 

02:25:15
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. Can you do it? Okay, that's the step, you can't do it because… 

02:25:25
LESLIE I know I'm not. 

02:25:25
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

02:25:25
EVY MCPHERSON Yes, you are. Yes, you are. 

02:25:25
MISTY I could, I wasn't able to do it until like two years ago. 

02:25:30
DR. ED JACOBS Oh, yeah. She just… I mean, believe me, I mean, this has been a long time… 

02:25:35
MISTY Oh, this is the long process for me, 10 or 15 years. So, umm… yeah, I could, I wouldn't even, it was… it's a… it is just a process that you have, you know, you just have to be willing to go through it and it's worth it. 

02:25:50
DR. ED JACOBS Chris, what do you have? 

02:25:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I don't want to give the impression, it's gonna take you take you 10 or 15 years from this point. I think, it can happen, I don't know what, how long have you been working in individual Misty? 

02:26:05
DR. ED JACOBS Often in home, for a long time. 

02:26:05
MISTY For a long time, but in that, during that time, umm… (inaudible ) had a husband who had to lie to every time I kind of had to come see it, it was just one thing after another. So, the whole time I'm fighting to get to this chair I have someone pushing me back which was my husband at the time. But then after, you know, sent him down the road, I was fighting myself and umm… you know, just took, umm… a lot of persistence. 

02:26:35
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL You got a… You got a lot of obstacles… 

02:26:35
MISTY Oh, yeah. 

02:26:35
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL …in your way. I guess, I would want… I wouldn't want you to leave. 

02:26:40
MISTY That's why it took so long. 

02:26:40
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yeah, I wouldn't want you leave group today thinking, oh, my gosh, I'm looking at a 10, 15 year back. 

02:26:40
MISTY No. 

02:26:45
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Because if you, I think, if you do this work you can get clarity on this. 

02:26:50
MISTY Yeah. 

02:26:50
DR. ED JACOBS Oh, yeah, you can clear though. 

02:26:50
MISTY That's one of the… 

02:26:50
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL You can clear though. 

02:26:50
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. And I know we're gonna follow-up. Shirley, can you say it? 

02:26:55
SHIRLEY Yes, I can. 

02:27:00
DR. ED JACOBS You can? 

02:27:00
SHIRLEY I can. 

02:27:00
DR. ED JACOBS Well, let's do it. 

02:27:00
SHIRLEY I'm okay. 

02:27:00
IVY You are. 

02:27:00
SHIRLEY I'm okay. 

02:27:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yes, you are. 

02:27:05
SHIRLEY You tell, I'm okay. 

02:27:05
DR. ED JACOBS You are. I really believe in you. Well, no. No, you don't want him come in through. 

02:27:15
SHIRLEY Yes, I do, 'cause it's important to hear that from you. 

02:27:15
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. Well, I've always thought you're doing okay. 

02:27:20
SHIRLEY I'm okay. 

02:27:20
STACY Yes, you are. 

02:27:20
SHIRLEY I'm okay. 

02:27:20
MISTY I agree 100% 

02:27:20
SHIRLEY I'm okay. 

02:27:25
ASRA You are. 

02:27:25
SHIRLEY I'm okay. 

02:27:25
RUTH Yes, you are. 

02:27:25
SHIRLEY I'm okay. 

02:27:25
EVY MCPHERSON Yes, you are. 

02:27:30
SHIRLEY And I'm okay. 

02:27:30
LESLIE Yes, you are. 

02:27:30
DR. ED JACOBS What was that like for you? 

02:27:35
SHIRLEY It was great. I feel okay. 

02:27:35
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

02:27:35
IVY She was rating, good. 

02:27:35
DR. ED JACOBS I know. 

02:27:40
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL You know what I find interesting is that we can sit in a room like this of… of with other women that we've just met, right. And say that and hear it and feel good, probably hearing it from these women that we don't even know. But, yet, it's still not enough to go home in a room by ourselves and say to ourselves and believe it. 

02:28:00
LESLIE Yeah. 

02:28:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Think about that, think about… 

02:28:05
MISTY It's worked for me to look in a mirror. And umm… It's just… I don't… It's just weird. I guess, like 30 seconds and I don't really look, I look past everything that I do and umm… yeah, but I can sit here and… 

02:28:25
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL You could… You can look at, who's someone, you just met me right. 

02:28:25
MISTY Uh-uh. 

02:28:25
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL And you can look at me and… and hear me say that you missed, you're okay and go. Yeah, you're right, I'm. But go home and not be able to do it for ourselves. 

02:28:35
DR. ED JACOBS And I think what Stacy said too is you look confident, but boy inside when she did that, you thought holy crap, that's me. 

02:28:45
STACY Huh-uh. 

02:28:45
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. Yeah. And that's what we want to try to help. The first step is… is awareness and then… 

02:28:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL And conscious. 

02:28:55
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, and staying conscious. And when you slide to the little one, at least come back, 'cause I know your decision to go out there, you know, go with your friend, you were in that seat and you were over here, then you were back there and I wonder, sure she is gonna get on the plane or not. 

02:29:15
STACY Yeah. 

02:29:15
DR. ED JACOBS I think, we all wouldn't have been surprised, right. Yeah. But you… And then you had a great time. 

02:29:20
SHIRLEY I had a wonderful time. 

02:29:25
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, yeah. 

02:29:30
SHIRLEY Yeah, I was surprised by going it by, I kept giving him away out. 

02:29:35
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, she kept saying that to the other guy. 

02:29:35
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL 'Cause you all went on a trip together. Is that… 

02:29:40
SHIRLEY Well, he was already there… 

02:29:40
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Oh, when you flew out. 

02:29:40
SHIRLEY …and I said, I would… and so the week he was gone, I kind of said are you sure you want to do this? I cannot come or you're tired maybe want to come home early and just like Ed on the phone says, stop doing that, stop doing that. 

02:29:55
DR. ED JACOBS Let me do one other topic for a few minutes. I know, Evy mentioned this and I think it's a topic. On a 1 to 10 scale, how much do you, is worry a big part of your life, if it's a big part, you know, it's a 10. If you don't worry much at all, it's a one. Or you worry about things? 

02:30:25
STACY Five. 

02:30:25
MISTY Seven. 

02:30:30
ASRA Probably three. 

02:30:30
RUTH Seven. 

02:30:30
EVY MCPHERSON Oh, right now, it's probably a 10 for me. 

02:30:35
LESLIE Probably a nine. 

02:30:35
SHIRLEY Umm… Six. 

02:30:40
IVY I'd say three. 

02:30:45
DR. ED JACOBS Tell us about your worry and then we'll pick up on other peoples. 

02:30:50
EVY MCPHERSON Oh, my current worry is, umm… this… 

02:30:50
DR. ED JACOBS Or just a habit in general. 

02:30:55
EVY MCPHERSON Yeah. Umm… Well, the biggest thing is trying to, I know, I'm gonna lose my benefits soon and it's you know trying to find a good job with benefits, it's… it's… it's… it's worrying me to death, you know, we talked about it the other day. 

02:31:05
DR. ED JACOBS  Okay. Let me try to reword this, because we could go through what you're worrying about and we help you with jobs and benefits. 

02:31:15
EVY MCPHERSON Right ,right. 

02:31:15
DR. ED JACOBS But it's, some people are worriers and some people are not. Everyone one of us have things that are going on in our life. But, why do you, how do you not handle it by worrying about it, what do you do instead? 

02:31:35
ASRA I think I come up with adult solutions. 

02:31:40
DR. ED JACOBS What do you do? 

02:31:40
IVY I take a walk in the forest. I do workout, do some pushups. 

02:31:50
DR. ED JACOBS But do you… But you don't perseverate on things? 

02:31:55
IVY I work things on my head, but not to the point where I'm dwell on it and make myself miserable. 

02:32:00
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. And what Asra said if you do it from this seat, instead of that seat, yeah, 'cause I start, I mean, we all do some of it, us worried about this, you don't have this all go, I know, I said just relax and, you know, it'll be fine. So, what is the process? What's the difference between a worrier and a non-worrier? You said yours is high. 

02:32:25
STACY No. 

02:32:25
DR. ED JACOBS Yours is low? 

02:32:25
STACY Mine was five. 

02:32:25
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. Yours? 

02:32:30
MISTY I would say a worrier is, umm… And I am by far an out of control freak, but it's just something I have to have a little bit of control of and I have zero control of. And that, I think, that makes me worry a lot. 

02:32:45
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, if there is a future event coming up. 

02:32:45
MISTY Yes. 

02:32:45
DR. ED JACOBS 'Cause used to, I mean, like this thing… 

02:32:45
MISTY Oh, yeah. 

02:32:50
DR. ED JACOBS …you would've been a wreck… 

02:32:50
MISTY Uh-huh, mess, yeah. I would've cancelled that, you know, everything. 

02:32:55
EVY MCPHERSON If someone said it's a plan or two, likes to plan, no, you know, plan for to get to your destination. 

02:33:00
MISTY Uh-uh. 

02:33:05
DR. ED JACOBS So, what if a person, if we were helping to Eve… helping Evy to not be a worrier, what would… what does one do to not be a worrier? 

02:33:15
STACY But it's this one event that she worries about? 

02:33:15
DR. ED JACOBS No. 

02:33:15
STACY Or does she worry constantly about everything? Is that… 

02:33:25
EVY MCPHERSON It's constant because of just a lot of events going on, knowing how, everything is up in the air and not knowing… 

02:33:30
IVY So is it a control issue then? 

02:33:30
EVY MCPHERSON Pardon me. 

02:33:30
IVY Is it a control issue do you think for yourself? 

02:33:30
EVY MCPHERSON No, I don't think it's a control issue in more as in high… high strung being someone that I was just thinking about that when you're talking about that, somebody is laid back doesn't worry, somebody, it's not lay backwards. 

02:33:40
IVY Really, 'cause most people tell me I'm high strung. I pretty much am. 

02:33:45
EVY MCPHERSON Yeah. See, that's, I feel that I… 

02:33:45
IVY I don't like, I was kind of… 

02:33:50
DR. ED JACOBS I think, if you're, you worry because, you know, I got to know what's going to happen, I got to know, what's to go on and… and it's… it's if there is a thinking process to a worrier and Wayne Dyer(ph) says that, you know, guilt and worry, the useless emotions, 'cause they don't do us any good, but there is people and I know Evy and I talked about that. 

02:34:15
STACY I mean, I'm worried. I don't… There is things I just don't worry about. 

02:34:20
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

02:34:20
STACY I don't know if that make sense. I mean I do worry about things. 

02:34:25
EVY MCPHERSON And I need to stop trying to, the control thing might be, you can't control the uncontrollable. 

02:34:30
STACY Right. 

02:34:30
EVY MCPHERSON I don't think I can control the things are going on right now, and it might be a control thing with me to control, you know. I look at it is planning, but maybe it is a control thing. 

02:34:45
RUTH But it's not, I just think about what I have to train to get that security and then it's not worth it for me. So, I then try not to worry about things like that is we're trying on my biggest worry is (inaudible ) and that's a huge one.. 

02:34:56
DR. ED JACOBS Sure. But does it have to be a worry or a concern? What's a difference between a worry and a concern? 

02:35:00
SHIRLEY What is the difference? 

02:35:00
DR. ED JACOBS Huh? 

02:35:05
EVY MCPHERSON Yeah, what is the difference? 

02:35:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL It's this. I think… 

02:35:10
MISTY This is worry and this is a concern. 

02:35:10
IVY Right, is it anxiety or something? 

02:35:10
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Yeah, this one that makes you sick to your stomach and that one you think on it, you think of a strategy, you think of a solution and you move towards that, right. 

02:35:20
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. And you go seek out other… When I have some issue and if I can't resolve it, I call up (inaudible ) or some of my friends and we brainstorm it together. 

02:35:26
MISTY Okay, like my ex-husband is going to prison in a couple of months and my 23-year-old son will be living in a five bedroom , three bath house, paying a… all the utilities with a part time job at Home Depot. So, I'm worried to sick about, I'm worried to death about him, because, you know, I've been through this with him before and he got a couple of roommates in there who, you know, I know, he's in charge of his own choices, but you know, took him down the wrong track I think. And, umm… So, I just, yeah, I'm worried, I'm worried about him. And, umm… you know, I just don't know how to not worry about him, but then again in this chair… 

02:36:05
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

02:36:10
MISTY I'm, umm… you know, I went to the beach four times this year. I went to Florida, Tybee Island and… and now it's just, you know, I enjoyed myself. So, it's just, umm… I guess what I want to, you know, I feel a little bit guilty, because now all this is happening to him and while I've been out living my life and I don't know how to, I don't know. 

02:36:35
DR. ED JACOBS It's thoughtful, concern, is this thoughtful? 

02:36:45
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Oh, my God, I mean, he is, he is 23 and he is gonna be living there and he… he is gonna, you know what, he is gonna move people in, they're gonna be doing drugs, they're gonna be drinking. He… He'll probably get fired, then what am I gonna do, I'm gonna have to take over the house payment, I'll have the house payment and I have to be supporting him. 

02:37:00
DR. ED JACOBS Right. 

02:37:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I have this Harley to paying on now. 

02:37:05
DR. ED JACOBS Stop. Stop it. 

02:37:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I… Oh my God. 

02:37:05
DR. ED JACOBS Stop it. 

02:37:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL What? 

02:37:10
MISTY It's me. 

02:37:10
EVY MCPHERSON That's me. 

02:37:15
DR. ED JACOBS I'm gonna… It is concerning and I'm gonna plan for it, I'm gonna talk to him. 

02:37:20
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL He won't listen. He won't listen. He won't listen to me and then we'll just be, oh, I mean… 

02:37:30
DR. ED JACOBS I'm gonna do what I can do. And I'll consult my board of directors, in my, you know, people, I'll consult Ed, I'll consult others about what to do, but worrying about it ain't gonna do anything 'cause first of all some of that may not happen. 

02:37:45
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL And I took over all trips this summer and I probably blew all that money, I'm gonna need that money to go in there and clean up his mess and pay that Harley payment. God, what was I thinking? Oh, my God. 

02:37:55
DR. ED JACOBS That's worry. 

02:38:00
MISTY You are damn right, it is. 

02:38:00
EVY MCPHERSON Hey, I've been there, done that. 

02:38:00
DR. ED JACOBS But… But this seat here doesn't fall for that. I mean, when you feel that getting worked up, you say, wait a minute get out of that seat, get over to the big seat, get over to the big girl seat or whatever you want to call it and then you think about it and you consult people, you ask, you ask your attorney, you ask whatever, whoever it is, but you don't… 

02:38:25
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Hold on, won't be burden with my issue? 

02:38:25
DR. ED JACOBS You know, this could be Nicky(ph), oh my God what's gonna to happen to my… you can do her for that… 

02:38:30
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Okay. I mean I… I'm gonna send this kid who is, she is a child. 

02:38:40
DR. ED JACOBS She is 21. 

02:38:40
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I'm gonna… She functions like a 14-year-old and I'm gonna send her out to live on her own. Oh my… uh… I mean, what… what if I call over there and she doesn't answer. Oh, my God, I'm gonna have to run over there every five minutes and check on her and then… 

02:38:55
DR. ED JACOBS See, that… that is worry. 

02:38:55
RUTH That is gonna be me. 

02:39:00
DR. ED JACOBS It does not have to be. 

02:39:05
RUTH Well, she… she already doesn't mean to… 

02:39:05
ASRA What would the adult look like in that situation? 

02:39:10
DR. ED JACOBS The adult would look like and then we'll… we'll summarize this, 'cause I think we probably would get out of here about four or so. No, if I put Nicky(ph) in the home, we're gonna do it, we're gonna try. It may not work, I hope it will work, but I'm not gonna do it if I'm gonna be a nervous wreck about it, then I'm not gonna do it. It will be easier for her to live with me, than for me to be a nervous wreck. Well, so what I'm gonna do and I got that, sort of, the help from the women here then it's… it's… it's a good thing for both of us and then I'm gonna try, I'll tweak it, I'll keep working it. But that's what I'm gonna do and there will be times that she may not answer the phone. She doesn't answer the phone now. 

02:40:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL And I have to go running over here? 

02:40:00
DR. ED JACOBS No, I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna do that. Because if she doesn't ans… If I do that, then I'm sitting in that seat. If I put her there I've got to trust that she is gonna be okay. Certainly somebody there would call me if it was a mess and if something goes on for a long time sure, I'll go over there. But I'm not gonna just drive myself crazy. I want a life, I want to stop worrying. You're a worrier. I want to be thoughtful about it. That is… 

02:40:40
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL If I don't worry, then it means I don't care? 

02:40:40
DR. ED JACOBS No, it doesn't mean that at all. It means that I've thought it through and I'm thinking it through, that's what it means. Does this… Does this make sense? 

02:40:55
RUTH I think a lot of it's here for me. I'm so afraid something will happen to her, that's why I've held on to her so tight and I think if I… 

02:41:00
DR. ED JACOBS But you… If you do it for the safety you got to know what it is if I'm gonna let her go live there, I'm choosing to do it and blah, blah, blah… Leslie, what are you thinking and then we'll, is this helping you some? In what way? 

02:41:20
LESLIE I see how much I worry. I never realized how much I worry that just seeing that. 

02:41:25
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

02:41:30
LESLIE Yeah. 

02:41:30
DR. ED JACOBS And I hope that didn't… I mean, you would laugh, sort of, but it's… I hope it you didn't find it attractive, or like oh, wow, that's… I want to be her. 

02:41:45
MISTY I found it very, umm… uses a lot of energy. I mean it, it just… 

02:41:50
DR. ED JACOBS Oh… 

02:41:50
MISTY It took a lot of energy for you to do that and it took a lot of energy for me to watch because that's… that's me and you know. 

02:42:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I almost sit there and have to create it. 

02:42:00
MISTY Yeah. 

02:42:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL You know, like… 

02:42:05
DR. ED JACOBS And then it drains you, it keeps you busy. 

02:42:05
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL It drains you. Yeah. 

02:42:05
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 'Cause if you don't have worry, then you get to live more fully. But that's what each of you got to decide it, that's what you want is to live a more full life then you reduce worrying. 

02:42:20
MISTY And I think when you said if I don't worry it means I don't care. I think, that hit up a lot of us. 

02:42:25
ASRA Yeah. 

02:42:25
MISTY To be honest. 

02:42:25
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, I remember I had this, this woman in a group that I was leading, she said she worried all the time about her mother, because she was a flight attendant. And I said, okay, so let me help you, to not worry, she said no I don't want to. 'Cause if I… 'Cause my worrying so far has been affective, you know, she hadn't died in a plane crash, so she didn't want to stop worry. 

02:42:50
LESLIE She didn't want to jinx it. 

02:42:50
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I had a teenager, I had a teenager once, one time that had a… like she was probably 17 and she had an infant, she completely believed that her worry kept that baby safe, 'cause she had been worrying for the first year and a half of its life or whatever that and the baby had been well, had well. So, the worry must work. 

02:43:10
[sil.] 

02:43:20
The Closing Phase 

02:43:20
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Every leader should make sure to allow a period of time for closing. Unfortunately some leaders do not stay conscious of the time or cannot cut off members. This leads to not having time for a closing. We think a closing is an essential part of any group experience. The closing phase is for reviewing what is transpired and tying up any loose ends. In this segment the leaders use two activities during the closing phase. They use a round where everyone shares what stood out to them and then they use an activity for giving other member support, encouragement and hope. They ask members to share any wishes that they have for each other. You'll see members sharing various wishes that are supportive and encouraging. Note the tone that the leaders set with their voices and words. The skills and techniques you'll see in this segment are 1. The use of rounds, 2. Drawing out, 3. Encouragement, 4. Holding and shifting the focus. 

02:44:25
DR. ED JACOBS What would you say you're taken away from this or what are you… what… what are you gonna think more about as a result to be in here today? And we'll hear from each of you and we'll wind down and stop. 

02:44:40
LESLIE I can't wait to come see you. 

02:44:45
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

02:44:45
LESLIE You're gonna have your work cut out. 

02:44:50
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. But this helped you get started? 

02:44:50
LESLIE Yes. Uh-uh. 

02:44:50
DR. ED JACOBS And I think, hearing from other people and all of you, many of you that I've seen individually have made the group thing made a little difference to see something. 

02:45:00
STACY Well, it doesn't make you feel like you're in there alone. 

02:45:00
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

02:45:05
STACY Like there are other people out there dealing with the exact, not the same situation, but the exact same problem or… 

02:45:10
DR. ED JACOBS Or is she like confidence or something and worry. 

02:45:15
STACY Right. 

02:45:15
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

02:45:15
STACY It… It kind of took me back for a minute that I was like, wow, is it, no… 

02:45:20
DR. ED JACOBS That's what. That's the… This is the… 

02:45:20
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL That's the power of group. 

02:45:25
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. This is the beauty of group. 

02:45:25
ASRA Oh, it's interesting. 

02:45:30
SHIRLEY You know, I can say some, I can say where I've been over this past five and a half years and where I sit more times now from the interaction that you two did. 

02:45:40
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

02:45:40
SHIRLEY And thinking rationally, that I find myself doing that. 

02:45:45
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. So how… what was… this was helpful to see that? 

02:45:50
SHIRLEY Yeah. To realize that I… when I first sat here I thought I sat there a lot, but… I sit in the big girl seat a lot more than what I thought. 

02:46:00
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL And then you gave yourself credit for it? 

02:46:00
SHIRLEY Well I didn't go (inaudible ). I realized that I do, I'm more rational thinking than what I was. 

02:46:05
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

02:46:10
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL Oh, yeah. 

02:46:10
IVY That's awesome thing. 

02:46:10
DR. ED JACOBS Oh, Evy. 

02:46:15
EVY MCPHERSON What I take from today is… is don't worry, be happy. I'll try to live my life, think positive and faint off the negative thought. It's a you know… 

02:46:25
DR. ED JACOBS And if you do it, if you do it consistently it pretty quickly can shift. 

02:46:30
EVY MCPHERSON That will take you (inaudible ). 

02:46:32
DR. ED JACOBS What I first learned is I was shocked that the negative stuff that (inaudible ), it's amazing, just all kinds of crap that runs through our head. But if you don't challenge it, you just, you know, it's just automatic. What's your take away? 

02:46:45
RUTH I think… I think my take today was just knowing that there are other people that have problems even if they're not exactly like mine. I'm not the anyone in the world that has thing wrong with her life and it also helped having people tell me that I'm not a horrible person for what I'm thinking about daily. 

02:47:00
DR. ED JACOBS You mean, in regards to Nicky(ph)? 

02:47:05
RUTH Uh-uh. 

02:47:05
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

02:47:05
RUTH Yeah. It's good to hear from that the moms. Yeah. 

02:47:10
DR. ED JACOBS Asra? 

02:47:10
ASRA Umm… Yeah, I think that this helped me especially in seeing other people's situation than my own parallel. However, expresses itself in my life, just being more mindful, I think, I knew about this concept but seeing how it expresses, all those challenges in other people's lives and it made me really connect in my own life. 

02:47:35
DR. ED JACOBS Misty? 

02:47:35
MISTY Umm… Well I remember the last picture I took at the beach was, of everyone laying up and my little thing was everyone has a story. And even though we don't know it and, you know, some people don't want to tell theirs, but, you know, I just think the group… group helps people feel like they're not being judged and umm… that we… that, you know, that we all accept everyone's problems here. And, you know, and just as not even know anybody's last names or anything, that I think, you know that we will get together again and umm… just be a great support group and I just think that's just everybody needs that. 

02:48:25
DR. ED JACOBS Ivy? 

02:48:25
IVY Umm… I think this will reinforce some things in my mind, umm… you know, how to be more forgiving of yourself and tolerant of yourself. 

02:48:35
DR. ED JACOBS And I hope you'll get, keep getting rid of the shoulds. 

02:48:35
IVY Yeah. That too. 

02:48:40
DR. ED JACOBS One last closing thing. If you have a wish for somebody, you know, people have said something and you might just… it's a simple phrase like my wish for you is that you will… and look, you know, 'cause I thing something you want to say, it's a way to say nice things, but you don't have to, but if you… you know, somebody said something boy, I wish you would do blah, blah or my wish for you is… Does anybody have any wishes for anybody? 

02:49:10
MISTY I wish for Shirley to be, umm… move on. 

02:49:15
SHIRLEY Oh, thank you. 

02:49:15
MISTY Be happy and embrace your man. 

02:49:20
SHIRLEY That's a lot. That's a lot, but thank you friend. 

02:49:25
MISTY Your friend. 

02:49:25
SHIRLEY My friend. It means a lot. 

02:49:30
DR. ED JACOBS Somebody else here? 

02:49:30
ASRA My wish… My wish for everyone really is that you all are really remarkable, like you need to, yeah, I saw you shift your eyes, I saw you mix, move your eyes away, but you are and you're beautiful and to live with any self-doubt is unnecessary and I know it just my little treading in the waters of adulthood and… and confidence is such a better place than insecurity and fear and just like, I think, everyone around in this room believes in you and I do too. 

02:50:05
DR. ED JACOBS Other people, specific wishes for somebody. 

02:50:10
IVY I wish for you, happiness and peace. 

02:50:10
LESLIE Thank you, thanks so much. 

02:50:15

STACY And it does get better. 

02:50:20
SHIRLEY I wish for Stacy, who's my niece to realize what a wonderful person you are. 

02:50:30
DR. ED JACOBS She is saying you can handle it. 

02:50:30
STACY She has been such a support for me, it's unbelievable and she doesn't fear. 

02:50:35
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. Don't look away. 

02:50:40

SHIRLEY First step, first step, first step. 

02:50:45
DR. ED JACOBS First step. 

02:50:45
SHIRLEY First step. Such a good person. 

02:50:45
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. But she didn't know what is that. 

02:50:45
SHIRLEY No. 

02:50:50
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. Say thank you. 

02:50:50
STACY Thank you. 

02:50:55
ASRA Oh, my goodness.

SHIRLEY Sorry, next time, I'll keep it to myself. 

02:51:00
DR. ED JACOBS No. Any other wishes? 

02:51:00
MISTY Yeah, I wish for Ruth and Evy, everyone here, I just wish, you know, an easier path in life and, you know, we can't sabotage our life anymore. And you know, we just have to start living, all of us. 

02:51:20
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. 

02:51:20
MISTY And I'll just think it's, umm… you know, now that we all basically have each other, we are a hell of a support group here and we all just, sort of, like been, you know, our connection is Ed and Chris and, umm… you know, we have, umm… I don't know, just to go down an easier path and not make it hard on ourselves because everyone else is trying to make it. 

02:51:50
DR. ED JACOBS And my wishes for Misty to believe what she is saying. 

02:51:55
[sil.] 

02:52:00
DR. ED JACOBS Not to sabotage. 

02:52:00
MISTY Yeah, not to sabotage. 

02:52:00
DR. ED JACOBS You know, some of you, I mean I think you could sabotage. 

02:52:00
MISTY Oh heck, yeah. 

02:52:05
DR. ED JACOBS And certainly you could sabotage. 

02:52:05
SHIRLEY Me? 

02:52:05
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, well, you could sabotage and I hope you don't do it. Yeah know, yeah. 

02:52:15
MISTY I hope, I don't either. But I'm aware of it now, when I start doing it that you know, the awareness is what keeps me from a 100% owner. 

02:52:25
DR. ED JACOBS Any other wishes for anybody? Okay, Chris? 

02:52:30
EVY MCPHERSON Okay. I don't want you to feel guilty for what you're doing with your daughter, because you're… she needs that, so do you. 

02:52:40
RUTH Oh, I don't want you feel guilty about what you're doing because you're doing the best thing for everybody. 

02:52:45
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah. That's good. Yeah. If you all could just follow-up each others… 

02:52:50
SHIRLEY I wish I have some of your confidence. 

02:52:55
IVY Sometimes I have too much. 

02:52:55
SHIRLEY I'm not saying that. 

02:52:55
DR. ED JACOBS Okay. 

02:52:55
DR. CHRISTINE SCHIMMEL I… I wish all for all of you to just to stay on this path, if this… you started individually, I think, we've tried to enhance it through a group experience here today or just to stay on the path and find peace and enjoy and that's what the purpose of life is, right, to enjoy it. And then the last thing I want to say as we close out is just like wow, what a lot of courage that each of you had to come here and share, to do this in this environment under these lights and umm… yeah, just thank you for your courage to come and talk and share some pretty deep levels about some real personal issues. So, thanks for that. 

02:53:35
DR. ED JACOBS Yeah, thanks. 

02:53:40
LESLIE Thank you. Thanks a lot. 

02:53:40

JONATHAN ORR Hello I'm Jonathan Orr, President of the Association for Specialists in Group Work and it is my distinct joy to welcome you to our website. Whether you're a long time member of the association or this is your first contact with the Association for Specialists in Group Work, I'm truly pleased to have a few moments to share with you. Probably the best introduction I can provide for you is to share the mission statement for our association. It reads. The Association for Specialists in Group Work, a division of the American Counseling Association, exists so that members and other helping professionals are empowered with a knowledge, skills and resources necessary to practice effective, socially just, and ethical group work in a diverse and global society. We value the creation of community; service to our members, their clients, and their profession; and group leadership as a process to facilitate the growth and development of individuals and groups. Well that statement really reflects who we are and where we're going and I'm excited to share with you some of the ways that we're currently implementing that mission. In terms of empowering professional group workers with knowledge, you simply need to look under the resources tab on our website. We have a large library of publications written by top researchers and noteworthy practitioners in the field. Collectively, these publications present cutting edge research and the most extensive collection of group work activities that defines state of the art in group work. If you're an audio or visual learner you can also find a collection of videos and podcasts from expert practitioners in the field. Those recordings give you the opportunity to learn not only what to do, but how to do it. Once you've figured out what to do and how to do it, then your next move is to click on our products tab, where you can purchase group resources for your own use. Whether you're looking to enhance your collection of props to enrich your group activities, adding to your collection of group activities or looking to demonstrate your love of group work, you'll find all that you need by clicking the products tab. Our time together is drawing to a close and I've saved the best part of our association for last. It's you, yeah, that's right, you. The best part of ASTW is its members. So, if you're already a member, thank you. You inspired me and others in our association to do great work and provide exceptional member benefits. If you're not yet a member, well, join today. What are you waiting for? You become part of a vibrant ASTW community and immediately begin reaping the benefits of membership like, full access to the archives and journals for specialists and group work and monthly delivery of the printed copy of the journal.

You can find all that you need to know for joining ASTW by clicking the membership tab on our website. As you may already know, groups work best when members are engaged, connected and committed. So, I will, in my time today by issuing you a challenge. How would you like to become involved? When you have an answer or when you have even an idea of an answer, I invite you to reach out and check in with me.
