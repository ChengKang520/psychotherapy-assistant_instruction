DIANE GEHART Hi, and welcome. My name is Diane Gehart and today we are going to be talking about mindfulness and psychotherapy. And as many of you know, mindfulness is a tradition that comes out of Buddhism and it's a meditation… it's a form of Buddhist meditation and there's been lot of interest in the West especially in the last 10 years about how mindfulness can be used to treat, umm… mental health issues. And this is actually something that began in the late '70s or mid to late '70s with Jon Kabat-Zinn's work in Massachusetts. And he was actually in a hospital setting and using mindfulness and seeing if it would make a difference and what's now called mindfulness based stress reduction program that was used with people in the hospital who were dealing with physical disorders, you know, such as heart disease, umm… chronic pain, fibromyalgia, various different types of physical disorders. And Kabat-Zinn was actually doing a lot of research and the research has been very encouraging. People who had actually been through Kabat-Zinn's eight week program umm… that their brain functioning actually shifted and there was what they would call more, uh… more left prefrontal cortex activation. And although that doesn't mean a whole lot to most of us, I think what's really important is that this left prefrontal cortex activation is correlated with not only happy mood states so that when you are in a good mood that's dominant in the brain, but actually positive dispositions. So, actually changing your personality in some ways for use personality in a loose way, but that you are more likely to be in a positive mood more of the time and it becomes almost a permanent characteristic of the person. So, this is really very exciting, umm… research that we are finding with mindfulness. And I guess maybe we could, I can just briefly describe what's actually happening in Kabat-Zinn's group. It is a group format and I would say that when people are training in mindfulness the group format can be really helpful because you have a group to come back to and who's supportive and they do it together each week and then they have homework assignments and they come back and report on it. But his program is actually broken down into three different parts, in three different types of mindfulness. One is doing a body scan meditation and many of us are familiar or have heard of body scan, but when it's done with mindfulness, it's done a little bit differently. It's not trying to relax the body like somebody scans where you're actually, you know, go into, you know, your feet and trying to relax them or such, that the mindfulness is just paying attention to that part of the body, umm… And so the first phase is teaching mindfulness using the body scan, but not so much trying to relax the body, but just notice and witness what is going on in the body. And then the second phase was mindfulness breath meditation and that's what most of us think of us when we hear of the word mindfulness where the participants are taught to focus on their breath and which we will be doing later in this tape. And watch and working on kind of more the mental aspects and what mindfulness can do in terms at a cognitive level. So, that's the second type of meditate… mindfulness meditation in Kabat-Zinn's program. And the third type is actually using some really some basic yoga postures. I mean uses mindfulness in a physical sense, umm… in integrating some of the yoga while being mindful while doing this various yoga postures. So, it's really a very comprehensive program that is group based and it's only… and its eight sessions long with one entire weekend. So, they do have an intensive actually 6 hours retreat. So, it's kind of an interesting combination, but there has been lots of very exciting positive outcome research. There is a theory that what mindfulness is doing is actually working on the amygdala. Now the amygdala is a part of the middle, part of the brain, so it's not, we do not have conscious control of our amygdala. But… But amygdala is central in the fight or flight mechanism. So, umm… let's say prehistorically this is very important part of the human brain because, you know, when… when a person was faced with, you know, a saber-toothed tiger or such a disaster, or such a, you know, threat in the environment, the amygdala was part of the system that revved up the body to either fight the saber-toothed tiger or run from it. I always think running would be better if I met a saber-toothed tiger, but so that's what the, umm… fight or flight mechanism is. The amygdala is actually the part of the brain that's constantly scanning all the time our environment looking for dangers. And it's… And as soon as a danger is sensed, umm… that it's… it sets off a chemical reaction in the body that starts our heart, you know, racing and our… you know, our pupils dilate and our hearing actually becomes better, but it sets off a whole set of, you know, a chemical reaction in the body before the prefrontal cortex, before the thinking conscious part of our brain can even register what's out there, our body has responded. And that's just part of our survival mechanisms that we've inherited. And what the problem is, is that in today's society most of our threats are psychological and so we don't need to be able to outrun a saber-toothed tiger. So, that is what stress is that we're con… chronically getting these threat messages, threat messages, and we're unable to turn it off. And so they were thinking what mindfulness is doing is, umm… is helping us learn to regulate and shut down the amygdala with the… with our prefrontal cortex and that's why having all the brain research and that learning about, uh… that mindfulness is increasing the left, uh… prefrontal cortex activation is so critical to understanding what's actually happening by doing this. And so basically what… what mindfulness helps us do, some people are thinking it's helping us to do, this is kind of really new research, is helping us to shut off that stress response. And so it's really kind of exciting to have a better sense of what mindfulness is actually doing at a physical level. So, that is a brief introduction to kind of what's going on in the field with mindfulness. Now mindfulness comes from a 2,500 year long tradition in Buddhism. And the first noble truth in Buddhism is that life is suffering or there is suffering in this life. And for many Westerners it's kind of a depressing place to start a religion, umm… But then the focus of Buddhism becomes, how do we deal with the suffering that's inherent in human life? And so in many ways Buddhism is, umm… is… is more of a psychology because it's very much focusing on, how do we deal with human consciousness? How do we deal with suffering? And many of the issues that Western psychologists deal with because Buddhism is actually atheistic, there isn't a God per se, umm… in the Buddhist tradition. Buddha is not a God. He is a man who was able to achieve enlightenment and learned how to deal with human suffering. And so in many ways the Buddhists have more of a what's comparable to a psychology in the West then what we would consider religion in the West. So, they start with this premise that life is suffering and the Buddhists would say that there are two types of suffering. One type is inevitable, we will be ill, we will die, there will be loss and sickness. There's certain types of suffering in the human life that are unavoidable, but then the Buddhists also say that there are certain types of suffering that are avoidable. And these are the ones that we kind of self-create. We… We hope that our lives will go a certain way, we hope that our friends will treat us in a certain way, we hope that our jobs, you know, that we will progress. And so all these hopes that we have, umm… and expectations of ourselves and others, this is more… there is more, umm… self-created suffering in these realms and so this is where Buddhists say we have the most impact in terms of reducing the overall suffering in our life. And so the Buddhists would say, the word that they use is attachment, and they use it in a very different sense than we talk about attachment theory here in the West. When the Buddhists talk about attachment they are talking about, how invested are we in a particular idea or outcome? For example, the classic example I use is the Cinderella fairytale. And so many women in the West have this idea as little girls that they are going to grow up and they are going to meet this Prince Charming who he is going to sweep them off their feet and then they are going to have a fantasy wedding and they are going to live happily ever after, you know. And so there are many, uh… young girls and women who try to live the Cinderella fairytale. And… And what the Buddhists would say is not that the Cinderella story so much is the problem, but it's how invested you are in it or how invested you are to not live the Cinderella fairlytale. Either person who is trying to, like, do anything, but have that or the person who is trying to have the perfect Cinderella fairytale, both of them are prisoners to that story. And so what the Buddhists are saying, we need to look at our attachments and reduce our attachments. We don't always get rid of them 100% I believe, but so that our happiness is not dependent on whether or not, you know, our wedding goes off without a hitch. And so that's the idea of attachments. And this is where mindfulness comes in because the Buddhists use mindfulness to reduce their attachments and their expectations to how life should go when ought to be. And so that is where the mindfulness comes in in terms of becoming the antidote for suffering. And it's not that mindfulness you get to a point where you don't want anything and you are detached and you don't care if things go well or if you don't care if they go bad. You still… Buddhists still want to have a good day and they still will go after goals in their lives, but they are not destroyed when things don't go exactly as they want because they are not attached. Their sense of self, their sense of wellbeing, their sense of happiness isn't a 100% determined on whether or not they get what they want, and that's where the mindfulness comes in. Some people I think misunderstand mindfulness as just totally not caring and being very, very detached and unemotional. I don't think that's the sense when you look at people, you know, from the East who practice this tradition. They are not detached from their lives, they are not unfeeling or uncaring about what happens. They are just able to more easily move with the ups and downs of life and so I think the term for that would be equanimity. I think is a good term in the West that we might use to describe that they are able… they understand that life will have its ups and have its downs and they're able to move more gracefully with the ups and downs. Now there are actually two different types of mindfulness meditation that we talk about here in the West. And one is Samassa and that is a single pointed type of mindfulness meditation where we focus on one thing. For example, breath meditation, when we're are focusing on the breath, that is a single pointed type of meditation. Similarly eating meditation, when you eat something mindfully is also a type of, umm… single-pointed mindfulness meditation. Or the body scan we talked about earlier that can… that's usually done in such a way where you are focusing on one part of the body at a time so again, that's a single-pointed type of meditation. Umm… A slightly more advanced form of mindfulness meditation is called the Vipassana and Vipassana meditation is once you've kind of gotten really good at focusing and quieting your mind. But with single-pointed Vipassana is when you sit and you begin to just watch what occurs in the mind or in your sense… field of sensory awareness, umm… and watch each one kind of go through. So you're actually, umm… in most other forms of mindfulness you are just focusing on one sense at a time or just, you know, mentally on what's going on in your mind on one thing at a time. With Vipassana you are going to allow all five senses and just kind of… you just kind of watch your mind. I like the image of clouds kind of moving across the sky. So, for example you might hear a noise and you would just maybe perhaps label that as noise and watch it kind of move across and let it go. And then you might have a thought and you will label that worrying or whatever type of thought it might be and you let that move through. And you might begin to feel cold or feel a tingling sensation in your body and again, you would just note that and moved through. But Vipassana is allowing multiple sources of stimuli, uh… to come through, arise, notice them and then let them go. And so that's a different task, slightly different type of mindfulness meditation. Now in terms of learning to do mindfulness from a Western perspective, I think the most important piece is understanding how central compassion is to mindfulness practice because when most Westerners kind of get their first instructions and okay, your job is to focus on your breath and when your mind wanders off is to bring your attention back and so most Westerners we kind of get this set of instructions. And that sounds pretty simple, I can do that, you know, that doesn't sound too hard, I don't see why this is so profound. And so we start, we sit down for our first, you know, let's say five minute session of mindfulness meditation and you realize that usually after one, two, possibly three seconds your mind begins to wander off, umm… And so you come and you bring it back and then you sit there and you go, this time I am going to do little bit better. Again, one, two, three, maybe four seconds, it wanders off and it comes back again. And before the first minute is over, most of us are beating ourselves up going, oh, my God, you got to focus, you got to work on this, how you can you not be able to, you know, do this, this is so simple or, you know, something much be wrong with you. And so most of us end up berating ourselves, through most of our mindfulness meditation sessions in the West because we are so use to getting a set of instructions and just doing it right, doing it perfectly, you know, executing it well. And… And the interesting thing is, is that that is really not I think the point of mindfulness, especially the way we are using it in the West when we're complimenting psychotherapy because so much of the therapeutic if we want to use that, benefit of mindfulness is that each time the mind wanders we bring it back to the point of focus. And I think that's actually when you are looking at the brain research and amygdala a lot of what we are doing is it's that bringing it back, bringing back your attention that we're actually deprogramming some of our automatic kind of fight or flight mechanistic responses. And so on some ways I, uh… I tell people when your mind wanders off and you bring it back, each time you bring it back that's where you are getting the therapeutic benefit. And so it's so important when the mind wanders off to be compassionate with the self. And in some ways I think this is the most important thing Westerners can get out of this as learning to be very kind to yourself, umm… when you are noticing you are not doing what you are supposed to be doing. And so there are different ways to deal with this, you can say, umm… some people will say, ah, yes, that too. Or you can label it worry or planning or you can label the thought if you are doing, like, the mindfulness breath meditation. Umm… and I think whatever you do when you see your mind wandering off is that just say yes, this is what's expected, this is what's normal and it's okay, and this is the process, this is what I am supposed to be doing and it's okay and to be very gentle with the self. So, I think at this point, uh… we are going to go ahead and start with an eating meditation. And actually mindfulness has been used, umm… quite a bit with eating disorders and so this is one of the exercises that they use, but eating… mindfulness eating, uh… meditation is a really nice way to start out because it's a very external concrete, umm… type of meditation where you can experience something. And the point of this meditation, umm… is to just… to practice using mindfulness with something that's a very familiar object and… and and how most often especially, uh… when we are eating most of us are either talking or reading or watching TV. And so little… there is so much in our experience that we are not experiencing because it becomes automate… automated. And through mindfulness eating we slow down that process, umm… and this is a form of meditation that achieves some of the goals we were talking about earlier, so. So. right now I am going to go ahead and pass around two different objects and I invite folks to pick one or the other for starters. There will be more here so we can come back for seconds later. This is done using raisins and so, umm… so that's one option here. And I also prefer, uh… to use chocolate because I am personally trying to achieve, uh… enlightenment through chocolate and this is my exercise for doing it so. Umm… But I like the chocolate because I think it's particularly hard to not have attachments to chocolate. And so it is a little more challenging to eat chocolate and not have a judgment call positive or negative. And so I just want to warn you if you are using chocolate for this exercise, I have had chocoholics decide that they don't like chocolate so much and I have had non-chocolate eaters become chocoholics from this exercise. So, it does come with a warning to you all who are using chocolate for this exercise, but it's… it's important that you do this exercise with a familiar piece of food, umm… because the… the idea is, is to see how we maybe eat either a raisin or a piece of chocolate frequently, umm… but yet never really fully taste it. I want everyone to take the object that is in their hands and I just want you to look at it and notice it. Just notice how the light reflects off, notice all the colors that are in the object that you are looking at. Notice its shape, notice how it feels in your hand. Notice its texture. Do people want to describe what they are seeing? Can you just describe what you are looking at? 

00:19:15
UNKNOWN My raisin, the colors are like light brown, dark brown, changing colors, some white, some on the surface. 

00:19:25
DIANE GEHART Mm-hmm. 

00:19:30
UNKNOWN And it… it's a nice soft raisin, umm… so it's not dry actually, it must be very tasty. I like raisins actually. And umm… my fingers became sticky. 

00:19:50
DIANE GEHART Mm-hmm 

00:19:50
UNKNOWN So, that's something that I usually don't like so much, but it's okay, okay. 

00:20:00
UNKNOWN My Hershey Kiss is brown, it's smooth. There is little light reflections, and my fingers too are becoming sticky. It reminds me of like a king or a castle, I don't know why, probably because of the sharp point at the top. 

00:20:20
DIANE GEHART Mm-hmm 

00:20:20
UNKNOWN And that's about it. 

00:20:25
DIANE GEHART Okay. What are you noticing? 

00:20:25
UNKNOWN In my raisin I was noticing that the colors remind of some of my wife's jewelry. 

00:20:35
DIANE GEHART So, what colors are you seeing? 

00:20:35
UNKNOWN Kind of deep purples and (inaudible ) kind of sparkles. 

00:20:45
DIANE GEHART Yeah, so the light's catching it? 

00:20:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, it feels like putty in my hands. I'd like to make into something, could mush it around. It's fun. 

00:21:00
DIANE GEHART So now at this point, umm… I want you to take the object in your hand and just, just smell it, bring it up to your nose and just notice how it smells and take that in. And again, just feel it, smell it. And does anyone want to just comment on anything you are noticing, maybe that you haven't noticed before or maybe even whatever it is you are having in your hand? 

00:21:30
UNKNOWN I wonder if didn't know that it's a raisin if I knew by the smell of it that it is a raisin. I never actually smelled it like that yeah, maybe. 

00:21:45
UNKNOWN It smells like… my Hershey's smell like butter and vanilla extract. 

00:21:50
DIANE GEHART Okay. Yeah. So, now I want you to just, do not eat it yet, but just put it up to your lips or close to your lips as if you are going to eat it and just notice what happens in your mouth. Do you start to salivate? Uh… Do you notice anticipation? But just… just as you are about to eat just hold it there and just notice what happens in your mouth, in your body, in your mind as you are getting ready to eat the object in your hand. And now I want you to go ahead and take a very small bite and let it sit on your tongue, just let it sit there and feel the flavors and let it move around your tongue and do you notice that it tastes different on different parts of your tongue? Can you feel or notice the texture? Just let it roll around your mouth and just experience, experience it slowly. Different tastes, textures, the thoughts that are moving across your mind and just let them go and just, just slowly taste. And when you are ready go ahead and swallow and then I want you to go ahead and continue slowly eating what you have in your hand if there is any left, umm… and just keep noticing the whole eating process, the taste, the smells, the textures, the thoughts that go through your mind and how your body reacts to what you're eating. 

00:23:35
[sil.] 

00:23:45
DIANE GEHART Those of you who are done, do you want to share your experiences? 

00:23:50
[sil.] 

00:23:55
DIANE GEHART What do you want to say? 

00:23:55
UNKNOWN The flavor, the flavor of the raisin, that's something interest, nothings actually a taste, taste is sweet, right. But the flavor, it is connected to the smell, sense of smell which I've experienced before I tasted it. So this already is working before I even touched it, so. 

00:24:15
DIANE GEHART That's nice to make the distinction between the taste and the flavor. 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN The flavor. 

00:24:20
DIANE GEHART Yeah. 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN And it's still lingering in my mouth. 

00:24:20
DIANE GEHART Mm-hmm. 

00:24:25
[sil.] 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN It's like a (inaudible ). 

00:24:31
DIANE GEHART Yeah. 

00:24:31
FEMALE Yeah, just one bite of… of a raisin. 

00:24:35
DIANE GEHART Yeah. Okay, others? 

00:24:40
UNKNOWN I've had a cold that it feels like it's kind of soothing my throat and kind of going up my nostril. 

00:24:50
DIANE GEHART Mm-hmm. Wow, there is that much from one raisin. Yeah. 

00:24:50
UNKNOWN Actually I cheated, I had two. 

00:24:55
DIANE GEHART Oh, okay, great. 

00:25:00
UNKNOWN Mine… became almost feel grainy like. 

00:25:05
DIANE GEHART Really? 

00:25:05
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm, and the taste isn't as sweet as you'd expect. 

00:25:15
DIANE GEHART Yeah, interesting. 

00:25:15
UNKNOWN So, like you said earlier you turn a chocolate lover into someone, it doesn't taste quite as good that was true for me. 

00:25:25
DIANE GEHART Yeah, it's interesting, interesting. And can anyone… Does anyone wanted to speak to just this little taste of mindfulness as I like to call it, umm… what was its experience like overall in terms of mindfully experiencing something? 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN When I was (inaudible ) into this raisin, usually you automatically put in… in your mouth and you eat it, but here I want to, wanted to focus just on those details the… the smell, the taste, the flavor and enjoy it. Now I don't… It seems that I don't need to eat the whole raisin for it, it's still there and it… it… it feels that the same function as if I ate a bunch of raisins actually. 

00:26:10
DIANE GEHART Yeah, yeah. 

00:26:15
UNKNOWN I don't feel the necessity to finish up the raisin. 

00:26:15
DIANE GEHART Yeah. Interesting 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN Not that I don't like it, I still like it, but I still have it in my mouth. 

00:26:25
DIANE GEHART Yeah, the experience was so intense just eating half a raisin. 

00:26:25
UNKNOWN Yes, yes, right. 

00:26:25
DIANE GEHART That there is no need to… 

00:26:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, I still have this half, but I still have a raisin in my mouth. 

00:26:35
DIANE GEHART Okay, great, great. 

00:26:35
UNKNOWN And I had a couple of thoughts. One was as a kid I remember parents always saying chew your food and I'm someone who kind of gulps my food and rushes throughout the week, hurries up. And I was also thinking what a difference it makes for someone who actually prepares a meal and actually has their hands in it and doing it and part of it and bringing it out and then eating it along with other people, what a difference that could be from someone who just seats at a table and eats. 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN And I was thinking it was such a new kind of experience that it was hard to even have words for it. 

00:27:15
DIANE GEHART A lot what mindfulness is doing is getting us out our kind of linguistic storing of our experiencing, judging and all these. I really like chocolate or I don't like chocolate. I love raisins, I don't like raisins and just to experience the chocolate, experience the raisin for what it is and not to put tons of words onto whether good, bad, whatever you know so, yeah, yeah. It's very different to just fully experience, to be in our experience without stories, without words. And then it's looking at when you make this part of your daily routine in various ways whether it's sitting meditation or a yoga or just… But having moments throughout your day where your present like this, fully present in the moment is really the purpose of what people are working towards with mindfulness as a practice and it's really a practice in terms of integrating it into your daily routine and… and I think a lot of what the practice is about is that when those stressful moments come you can keep breathing, you can still remain kind of grounded, conscious, and aware and not have that automatic fight-flight stress response to the… as little things come across your day because you are able to be in the moment without reacting. And it's exciting to say that some of the brain research is supporting what Buddhists have been done for 2,500 years. So, next, umm… we are going to move into, umm… the one-pointed meditation on the breath. And this is the classic form of mindfulness meditation. And with this form of meditation what you do is you can either close your eyes or close them three quarters of the way and look, umm… at a point on the floor two, three feet ahead of you and that's typically actually how they do it in the East. In The west there seems to be a pretty strong preference for closing your eyes. And so either way it works and you can experiment with different ways to see what seems to feel right and work best for you. And what you will do is just close your eyes and try to focus on your breath, begin just watching the breath, umm… classically you watch the breath kind of come in and out underneath, uh… the nose, you can also watch your breath in terms of how your belly rises and falls. Umm… So, you can pick various points to even focus on within breath meditation. So, find a focus point if you are beginning that just feels comfortable for you. You know, noticing the air coming in and out of your nose is too fine or too difficult for you to really imagine or focus on. You can focus on the breath or just any other part of the breathing process that really becomes an easy point for you to focus on. Now what you try to do is just watch the breathing and like I said earlier this would probably work for about two, three, four, five seconds at the most and your mind is going to wonder off and that's part of the process and that's where you learn to be compassionate with yourself. And as it wanders off and you begin to notice that it wanders off, you just bring your focus back to the breath and you can label it as, uh… there I go again or oh, there is a worry thought or there is a planning thought, umm… And just notice it and then bring your focus back and sometimes it will just wander off for few seconds and sometimes it might be even a minute or more where it wanders off and comes back, but I think the most critical part of this is to be compassionate with yourself. When you notice that you've wandered off and to it bring it back and that is really a critical part if not the most important part of the mindfulness breath meditation is that being gentle with yourself when your mind wanders off. Let's go ahead for the next few minutes in silence and just focus on your breath. 

00:31:05
Three Minutes Have Passed 

00:31:10
[sil.] 

00:31:20
DIANE GEHART Okay, come on out, come on back. How did that go through people? 

00:31:30
UNKNOWN You mean how we kept our… I kept myself focused on breathing? 

00:31:35
DIANE GEHART Yeah. Yeah, was it… what was it like? 

00:31:40
UNKNOWN I felt my… my lungs first of all more than… compress or the wind. Actually with when I was focused on… on the breathing I could easily just fall asleep like. And I didn't want to go there so I wandered again. I was thinking about that how the camera is watching me while I am breathing and falling asleep, so that's another thought that had to bring back to me and focus to my breathing. 

00:32:25
DIANE GEHART Were you able to do that? 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, sure. 

00:32:25
DIANE GEHART Good. How did you do that? What did you tell yourself when you are bringing yourself back? 

00:32:30
UNKNOWN Okay, it's about my breath, I am going back to my lungs… 

00:32:30
DIANE GEHART Okay. 

00:32:30
UNKNOWN …and forget about the camera. 

00:32:35
DIANE GEHART Yeah. 

00:32:35
UNKNOWN Uh… And actually I enjoyed it again, the… the feel of fresh air coming into my lungs. 

00:32:45
DIANE GEHART And that's something I (inaudible ) give a lot of instruction about because, uh… sometimes I think when people are starting off, I don't go into sitting a whole lot just… just to focus. But ideally if you, you know, try to do this every day, traditionally people sit on the floor in lotus position, you know, when they did mindfulness meditation. A lot of people in the West prefer to sit in a chair and it's best to actually sit whether with your back not to the… to sit upright like this with your legs uncrossed, so you can breathe better like you are describing, umm… to take it more formal, umm… sitting position and it's very important also to adjust your posture, just sit up straight. But you're able to keep coming back. 

00:33:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, sure. 

00:33:25
DIANE GEHART Great. 

00:33:30
UKNOWN Yeah, I had almost an identical experience, you know, where the camera coming back. 

00:33:35
DIANE GEHART Yeah. 

00:33:35
UNKNOWN Umm… But I noticed that when I would come back and focus on my breathing of certain muscles on my body would relax like my neck muscles relax and then my head would drop. So, then I have to come to back to focusing on breathing and… 

00:33:50
DIANE GEHART So without even trying to relax your muscles. 

00:33:50
FEMALE Right, they just did. 

00:33:55
DIANE GEHART They just did, yeah, and that's a lot of how they've used mindfulness when they've used it in, you know, physical health situations. That you're trying to relax muscles, but just quieting the mind a little bit, umm… does relax the muscles and some of it's kind of I guess what they are talking about, shutting down the parts of our brains that kind of keep us in stress mode. Yeah, great. Okay. And what did you tell yourself to bring yourself back? 

00:34:20
UNKNOWN Pretty much the same thing, focus on breathing, go back to… I also felt it in my lungs more than my stomach. 

00:34:25
DIANE GEHART Okay and were you are able to do that compassionately or there was a guilt attached to it? 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN No, there was no guilt. 

00:34:30
DIANE GEHART Great. 

00:34:35
UNKNOWN This was familiar, one thing it's fit out for me, I have a slight tremor on my left hands sometimes and when it began… I begin to experience it, I didn't try to stop it or hold it, I just kind of went with it and it felt more comfortable. 

00:34:50
DIANE GEHART Is that different thing what you normally do? 

00:34:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, I usually grip it or try to… 

00:34:55
DIANE GEHART Yeah, stop it from doing that. 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN Right, you don't want to say have other people see it. 

00:35:00
DIANE GEHART Yeah, yeah, and what was it like just letting it be and letting it go? 

00:35:05
UNKNOWN It felt more comfortable. 

00:35:05
DIANE GEHART It did? Did you… Did you notice that it may be stopped sooner than you thought it might? 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN I didn't notice it, because I… I kind of went back to my breath. 

00:35:15
DIANE GEHART You went back to your breathing, you just let it do what it was doing and you went back to your breath. Oh, great, great. Yeah, it's been fascinating, uh… I think working with mindfulness on the physical parts and pains. And how very because often when we are in pain or we have like a tremor, we… we just think oh, my god, you know, the pain's back or what. And you begin to notice with mindfulness how… because you can actually do mindfulness meditation on the tremor and just noticing how it works and how different parts of your arm feels, how the rest of your body feels or with pain. They have people actually mindfully focus in on the pain and then you begin to notice that it actually moves and it comes in waves and it, you know, it softens and that actually even a lot of our physical, you know, symptoms have a lot of movement to them that we normally don't notice when we are experiencing. I mean just wanting to get rid of them, uh… as quickly as possible. It's normally our… our knee jerk reaction so that's great that you were able to do that. And I think that some of the beauty that, umm… comes with practicing this is that a lot of little things that maybe would have upset us before, you know, someone making a noise during a videotaping or, you know, your kids screaming when you are trying to, you know, get some work done or, you know, a cat's knocking over your set props, uh… while you are taping, umm… All of these things we can often would react to as oh, my god, this is bad, you know. And what mindfulness teaches you to do is to maybe your amygdala gets triggered, but then you learn to just calm down and oh, that's just one way it can happen and maybe there is another way. And you learn to undo that, those that automatic reaction that we have to lots of little stresses especially in our life. I think that's one of the first place that you begin to notice that when you start mindfulness practice. I was just curious with any of you, were you surprised at how all the different places your mind visited in three minutes? It's interesting I found that mindfulness meditation in some ways I think it is as kind of like being an anthropologist or a, you know, observer of my own mind and I've just been fascinated as to have a mind that actually works. I think before I started doing mediation for me I used to think that pretty rational logical person kind of think with A to B to C. I kind of had this image in my mind that, you know, I kind to put the pieces together in a logical way and mindfulness really taught me it's… I'm kind of like jumping all over the place oh, there is a noise and oh, I need to do this, and oh, I have to remember to tell so and so this. And oh, my gosh, I got so much work tonight, you know. And it's just like they are all over the place, you know, and it's just… and it was so… almost felt… That's how my mind works I don't know if you guys had some of those experiences, but I was just surprised within, you know, even a three minute span that we had here, it's like there were 60 conversations or 60 topics that came up and some people called that monkey mind, mind that kind of jumps all over the place. And I… I think it's really fascinating, umm… especially when you are thinking about mental health to actually understand that the mind's not as logical and linear is we often portray it to be. That it kind of functions in a more erratic way and it makes me make more sense of myself and others and I have more compassion. I just think for how we move through life and how people move through life. So, did anyone else have any comments about, umm… how the mind kind of wandered, and were you surprised about that? 

00:38:35
UNKNOWN I wonder how it can be used, umm… if we want to focus on task that we're doing. Uh… If we could use the same technique to bring our minds back to… to the task that we're doing, or to the thought. 

00:38:55
DIANE GEHART Yeah, yeah. 

00:38:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:38:55
DIANE GEHART You maybe heard the expression chop wood, carry water. 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:39:00
DIANE GEHART And that comes from a zen expression where the zen traditional actually use mindfulness as really very, very central in their practice, umm… compared to other Buddhist techniques, mindfulness is very, very central in zen transition. As they would use the chopping of the wood as mindful and they would experience as they were chopping wood and carrying water to very daily tasks, you know, at that time, survival tasks really, umm… that you are mindfully present as you go to draw the water or as you went to go to chop wood. And so the… those tasks in daily living which we translate to washing dishes or eating nowadays or even walking down the hall to go and meet your client, umm… can be moments where you just become very present, umm… in… in the task that's at hand. And you still will experience the same affects that we've experienced here with the eating meditation and the breath meditation. So… So, you doesn't always have to be sitting for 20 minutes a day, umm… even sitting for like we've experienced three minutes, five minutes, it really does have an effect on the mind and quieting the mind and allowing you to focus better on tasks. 

00:40:10
UNKOWN And this, you think after, actually that what you stated that after eight weeks of this repeated exercise actually our physical, mental, mental is changing. 

00:40:25
DIANA GEHART Yes, yes where your brain patterns… your brain patterns are changing is what they have found, but that they did see significant changes in how the brain functioned after eight weeks of doing this. There is a lot going on that we are learning about in terms of the mind and the body and how mindfulness affects it. 

00:40:40
UNKNOWN It seems like it would be such a helpful way to move through life. 

00:40:40
DIANA GEHART Yeah. 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN You know, not just deal with tasks, but to actually be this way consistently. 

00:40:45
DIANA GEHART Yeah, yeah, there's a lot to offer in terms of quality of living, okay. Well, thank you all very much for joining me today.
