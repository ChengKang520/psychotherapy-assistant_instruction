EDWARD HOFFMAN What are the things that's so important about the hierarchy of needs is that it provides specific and concrete ways to look at the individual.

SHIELA M. SMITH If you look at a nursing care plan you will see Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. 

00:01:10
Raj Raghunathan Ph.D. Asst. Professor of Marketing 

00:01:10
RAJ RAGHUNATHAN The Maslow's Hierarchy is very useful for a marketer because it, it gives you a role map as to how to, to package or I guess manipulate or, uhm, mold your, your offerings in such a way as to, uhm, satisfy the consumers' need given the consumer's progression on the Maslow's hierarchy. 

00:01:35
Karen Prager, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology 

00:01:35
KAREN PRAGER The hierarchy of needs is like bedrock. It's part of our assumptive world the we bring into treatment with us. 

00:01:40
John Sibley Butler, Ph.D. Professor of Management and Sociology 

00:01:40
JOHN SIBLEY BUTLER Whenever we think about what we need, ah, that whenever we see people starving whenever we see people dying of thirst, whenever we see people need shelter, the academics are the active measure that we go back to on the humanitarian side of Maslow. 

00:02:00
Introduction to the Hierarchy of Needs Shiela M. Smith MSN, RN, FNP-C Clinical Faculty Nursing 

00:02:05
SHIELA M. SMITH Abraham Maslow was one of the founding behavioral theorist, uhm, utilized in, uhm, sociology, social psychology, behavioral psychology. The crossover for that impacts all sciences, human sciences including the science of medicine(ph). 

00:02:25
Edward Hoffman, Ph.D. Author, Psychologist Abraham Maslow 1908-1970 

00:02:25
EDWARD HOFFMAN Maslow struggled as a young man to overcome a very unhappy, dysfunctional family, ah, he didn't feel close to his parents, ah, it was actually one of his aunts who played the role of a parent figure in his life. Ah, for most of us growing up with a mother or father that we love is very important to our sense of psychological well-being but he didn't have that. Ah, what was fascinating to me was he had a tremendous drive to be successful in life and he was over-- he was able to overcome his early deprivation 

00:03:00
Karen Prager, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology 

00:03:00
KAREN PRAGER The hierarchy of needs is part of Maslow's motivational theory or theory of motivation and what he's-- what he proposed was that every organism, every living thing has a hierarchy of needs of which survival is the most basic. The fundamental most driving force in a human being when the survival needs are not being met-- what Maslow recognized with the hierarchy is that we pay attention to the most urgent needs that we experience and that our-- this holistic concept of personality that our behavior, cognition, emotion and motivation will center around what is-- whatever is the most urgent unmet need. And according to Maslow on the hierarchy, the most urgent needs-- unmet needs are gonna be the ones that are at the bottom of the hierarchy. 

00:04:00
Raj Raghunathan Ph.D. Asst. Professor of Marketing 

00:04:00
RAJ RAGHUNATHAN But it's also true that once those needs are satisfied we clearly want to move on to the next stage of the evolution. 

00:04:05
D-Needs or Deficiency Needs B-Needs or Being Needs Deficiency Needs are self-oriented needs. And individual experiences a deficit state when these needs are not met. 

00:04:05
KAREN PRAGER Maslow talked about two kinds of needs. The D-Needs or Deficiency Needs and the B-Needs or Being Needs. The deficiency needs are needs that I need for myself. They're very self-oriented needs. They are things that allow me to survive, to feel safe, to feel loved and to feel like I have esteem for myself. So they are things that I pursue in order to take care of myself. 

00:04:35
Being Needs are needs a person has for others. 

00:04:35
KAREN PRAGER B-needs or being needs are more needs that I have, uhm, for others, for the world, for a sense of meaning and purpose in my life. Uhm, they're oriented at work more. 

00:04:50
John Sibley Butler, Ph.D. Professor of Management and Sociology 

00:04:50
JOHN SIBLEY BUTLER When you look at his hierarchy of needs, it's always good to go back and think scientifically. 

00:04:55
SHIELA M. SMITH Maslow's hierarchy of needs is the foundational element for every science that has to do with human beings. 

00:05:05
RAJ RAGHUNATHAN There are two arguments that he makes I think. One is that there is such a thing as a hierarchy of needs and that certain needs are more fundamental or basic, uhm, and therefore people seek them before they seek other kinds of needs but the second idea which builds off of the first is that once those needs are met, ah, and then it's like a bucket being filled up, they go on to the next bucket. They go on to the higher order needs so the lower order needs assume lower priority at that point in time. 

00:05:30
B.F. Skinner 1904 - 1990 Sigmund Freud 1856 - 1939 

00:05:30
EDWARD HOFFMAN Maslow's theory represented a new force in psychology separate rom the behaviorist view. B.F. Skinner was the, ah, major proponent and separate from the psychoanalytic view represented by Freud and his followers. That's why for this reasons this was called the third force in psychology which is known as humanistic psychology. And what Maslow said he was the founder or co-founder of the field of humanistic psychology is that we continue to grow in life in our personality that we do not stop growing when we stop growing physically by the end of adolescence. 

00:06:10
JOHN SIBLEY BUTLER Unlike people like Freud, I think that Maslow was more concerned with the overall structure of human needs. 

00:06:20
EDWARD HOFFMAN All over the world, people find his approach to motivation to be the most comprehensive. 

00:06:30
Self Actualization Esteem Love & Belonging Safety & Security Physiological Physiological need are need that must be met in order to survive 

00:06:35
KAREN PRAGER Physiological needs at the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy and they are needs that we have to get me in order to survive. So that I think Maslow recognized that for example, when we're starving, that the more starving we are the more likely we are to behave in ways that we would ever behave when we're not starving. Uhm, and, ah, slowly but surely what happens when our needs for survival are not being met is our higher values go by the wayside. 

00:07:10
RAJ RAGHUNATHAN The higher order needs are only, ah, salient, uhm, are, are-- they're only pursued when the lower order need-- the minimal needs are met. And when they're not met then, ah, we go back. Our whole focus is on first taking care of the minimum needs. 

00:07:25
EDWARD HOFFMAN Is someone, ah, is put on a plane on the tarmac for eight or 9 hours, ah, their behavior starts to change, ah, significantly. 

00:07:35
KAREN PRAGER Our higher selves, uhm, cannot function when we've got this long term chronic deprivation of our physiological needs. We need those to live. 

00:07:45
RAJ RAGHUNATHAN If you have a desire to live then you would have needs, you would have a whole bunch of needs. 

00:07:55
KAREN PRAGER We know that there's a hierarchy either within our physiological needs. Uhm, and it has to do I think-- and I don't know how many species this will be true of it. Certainly true for our species, that we can't go as long without water as we can go without food, ah, without dying so that we'll have our need for thirst will be one of the urgent. Even more urgent that that is our need to have enough oxygen. We can't hardly go anytime at all without oxygen. All right, and so that would be the most urgent need, uhm, the-- with water being very close up there, hunger being a lower need. Being able to keep warm, being a lower need. 

00:08:30
SHIELA M. SMITH It's easier for a nurse to understand why a patient can't, ah, process death and dying when they're worried about paying their life bill. Maslow outlined how to think about that. 

00:08:45
EDWARD HOFFMAN We like to focus on the higher needs but we also need to keep in mind that the lower needs are always present. 

00:09:00
Safety & Security 

00:09:00
JOHN SIBLEY BUTLER Safety for, for the need structure has always been important because without safety you disappear. 

00:09:10
EDWARD HOFFMAN Security, ah, can change us. That when we become most concerned about having a roof over our head, ah, about whether we'll be physically safe, ah, from violence that we move down the pyramid very quickly. Uhm, we can't take for granted, ah, that fact that a lower need has been met because if the lower need suddenly comes back into play then the self actualization or growth that we have achieved, that gets put on the back burner. 

00:09:40
KAREN PRAGER Katrina victims are a really good example of a group who were probably dealing with higher end needs, at least most of them were. And then when the hurricane his, they were all probably dealing with survival and safety needs. It was like a complete instant refocusing and I think, well Maslow would say is that that's universal among human beings. That all of us are driven to survive. All of us need to be safe and that when those needs are not met, we become preoccupied with those needs. And if you wanna look at a population like the one in New Orleans or any population for example that's under influence of war, then you're gonna find that these lower level needs dominate. 

00:10:25
RAJ RAGHUNATHAN When you are seeking security, things that remind you of the safe comfortable times like the Volkswagen beetle maybe. Become suddenly more tackled because it associated with a past which was comfortable, which was-- which said-- provides a sense of nostalgia, you know. You go back to your childhood, take us back to that state of the being where you were taken cared of. The way you were pampered, the way you were comforted. 

00:10:50
EDWARD HOFFMAN The hierarchy of needs offers a model for studying different societies and cultures. 

00:10:55
JOHN SIBLEY BUTLER One of the best ways to study the hierarchy of needs is to go to places where we don't make assumptions-- assume that they are there. 

00:11:00
Abraham Maslow 1980 - 1970 

00:11:00
EDWARD HOFFMAN I spoke in Sao Paulo which is the most dangerous city in the world in terms of crime, street crime or certainly one of the most dangerous and it was very poignant for me. I spoke at a college audience and someone in the group said to me, "Can you still self-actualize if you worried about security and at that moment I could have heard a pin drop in a large auditorium of about 200 students. This was a question I was never asked in the United States but most of us, when we go to our parking lot outside of where we work, we're not particularly worried that, that we'll be robbed or kidnapped or even on the street when we shop, ah, but in a country like Brazil, this is a very serious question. Maslow never said that you cannot move on to the next level, uhm, if you still have issues that at a lower level. You just said that the lower level issues are still in your consciousness. 

00:12:00
JOHN SIBLEY BUTLER Instead of looking at this, his needs are linear. I think you look at 'em as interactive. 

00:12:05
RAJ RAGHUNATHAN Safety and security needs are of course, ah, very important and, and, ah, there's lots of ways in which, uhm, marketers try to kind of, uhm, assure consumers that, ah, their products will ensure a level of safety, uhm, or, or security. To some level what the consumer seeks is the is a sense of security and assurance if you will, ah, a sense of confidence that this product is gonna work as, ah, expected or as advertised because there is a sense of security that these consumer seeks. Ah, from, you know, putting down money and taking risk and buying a product. Ah, they want some assurance that it's-- some security that's gonna work well. Vending is an assurance that the, the part of the buyer, the service of that you buy is gonna live up to your expectations and therefore provides a sense of security. 

00:12:50
EDWARD HOFFMAN The ideal would be to live in the society where you don't have to worry about, ah, security, about safety needs and Maslow felt very strongly this means that every child ideally should live in a world where all of the lower needs are met and we don't see this in the 21st century, the very few places. So all of us living in the 21st century have a road map for what we can do to contribute to the world. 

00:13:25
Love & Belonging 

00:13:25
KAREN PRAGER The, ah, third level on Maslow's hierarchy is the love and belonging level, uhm, where our needs to be accepted as part of a group, to be cared for just because we are who we are. Uhm, to be treated as an indi-- and of ourselves rather than as a means to somebody else's goals. Uhm, to be, to be loved, to be special, to be irreplaceable to at least one or two other people. Uhm, this is where love and belonging needs are and this is the social aspect of human beings. We are a social species, we, ah, do survive in groups and there seems to be a need in us that corresponds to that. That we see another species as well which is a need to be around others. 

00:14:15
RAJ RAGHUNATHAN People are, uhm,-- seek connections with other people. It's very, very important to them and, ah, they wish to maintain and nurture these bond that they create with other people. 

00:14:25
SHIELA M. SMITH But longing needs don't end when a person enters a hospital. 

00:14:30
EDWARD HOFFMAN If a person is in a nursing home or is a person is in a rehab center, ah, the often can feel very isolated. It's very important for staff to make that person feel part of a group. Uhm, and to be valued as an individual. 

00:14:45
SHIELA M. SMITH You can understand which patients are the ones that have an unmet belonging need by how many times they call on the call light. Uhm, sometimes nurses will mark how many times they call on the call light and the more times they call on the call light, it will help them define a care plan for that patient. 

00:15:05
KAREN PRAGER We can use the hierarchy of needs to understand ourselves better just by being aware of which need is dominating as any given time. We can tune in to ourselves. In fact, I would say that it was very, very important to Maslow that people be very self-aware in order to be able to respond to your needs effectively, you have to know what your needs are and what the hierarchy of needs does is it gives us some handles to be able to recognize what needs are dominating us at a particular time so that for example, if you lose your spouse, your spouse dies, let's say. Uhm, your need for love and, and belonging might actually come to the fore whereas while you were married it was a met need and so you had to obviously maintain your marriage but you weren't dominated by the need to find love and belonging in your life. That once you're a widow, you might find that you put a lot more energy into that need and maybe surprised to find that unless you're familiar with the hierarchy of needs and you know that, that's expected. That's what you would naturally expect to have happen in you know Maslow's theory. 

00:16:15
SHIELA M. SMITH In nursing, hopefully we could help people to define what their needs are in a way so that they can maybe throw away the extemporaneous things and really see what's important. Then they can move up the ladder. 

00:16:30
RAJ RAGHUNATHAN To look at, uhm, advertisements by this show, ah, pictures of babies or, or, you know, puppy dogs and so on and so forth. They're trying to evoke the sense of wanting to be attached or, or loved with, with this, this, with this brand ultimately, ah, to showing you pictures of things that the know as, as likely to evoke those kind of strong emotions. These are some, ah, subtle ways in which advertisers or, or marketers take-- try and take advantage of, of the need for love and belonging. 

00:16:55
KAREN PRAGER Madison Avenue and advertising definitely work on our needs. There's no question. Uhm, I think of course maybe being female I'm very aware of how much Madison Avenue focuses on our need for love and Madison Avenue would have us believe that in order to get love we have to have just the right makeup, just the right fashions, you know, just the right perfumes. So I think Madison Avenue plays a lot on these for love but it also plays on our needs for esteem to the extent that what we associate our esteem with our material wealth then we are going to be vulnerable to those messages. 

00:17:40
Esteem Archives of Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute, Warm Springs GA 

00:17:40
JOHN SIBLEY BUTLER I think the, the esteem needs-- of course the both internal and external and like status. That status is conferred upon you. On the other hand, they're the internal things and the internal things are the things that drive individuals. 

00:18:00
SHIELA M. SMITH I think there are certain basic domains where people need to feel confident. The obvious one is either as students or as workers that we need to feel at least in this country we need to feel like we're confident in those areas. Uhm, another area is socially we want to feel like we are confident at making people like us, at being appropriate socially so that people didn't roll their eyes when we walk into the room. Uhm, at being able to have a certain number of friends. 

00:18:30
EDWARD HOFFMAN If you're depressed, it you're clinically depressed or just not feeling good about yourself, it's very hard to move from that to a state of being creative and involved in passionate about helping the world. So the question is you need to move especially through the levels of self-esteem and self-respect. And I think this is where therapy and counseling are very, ah, involved in our society. People need to learn how to respect themselves. 

00:19:00
Archives of the College of St. Catherine, St. Paul, MN. Esteem Archives of Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute, Warm Springs GA 

00:19:05
SHIELA M. SMITH We help the patient to define what is right for them and listen to what that is. And then help them provide it for themselves and they come out of it feeling good about themselves. 

00:19:15
RAJ RAGHUNATHAN If you have a person that's really high on, ah, esteem needs, you know, somehow has a desire to be seen by others has been, uhm, have as-- having been-- having arrived, you know. So they might seek, ah, the products that have high, you know, image. 

00:19:30
EDWARD HOFFMAN Maslow thought that if you don't add a certain point in your life begin to focus on your higher needs, ah, your needs for respect, for esteem and especially for creativity that this may actually undermine your physical health. 

00:19:45
JOHN SIBLEY BUTLER If you don't take care of those needs, then what happens? You're less likely to be a full pledged human being. 

00:19:55
EDWARD HOFFMAN Not only do children in a-- adolescence have a need for self-esteem but this is basic to fulfillment as we go through life as adults. That, uhm, we need to find out what give each of us a feeling of confidence in life. Ah, and Maslow felt this is something people can gain and regain throughout their life. Uhm, people need to find ways to achieve self-confidence and after that Maslow felt the issue of self-actualization open ups. 

00:20:35
Self Actualization 

00:20:35
KAREN PRAGER Self-actualization is the highest level of the hierarchy and we would say that we're self-actualized when we are pursuing those things that make our life meaningful and purposeful and full, uhm, and when we can focus less on ourselves and more on what's going on in the world around us. 

00:20:55
Archives of the College of St. Catherine, St, Paul, MN. 

00:21:00
EDWARD HOFFMAN We are born with a certain temperament, a core personality and if we're fortunate we're able to understand what our temperament is and to fulfill it. The needs that we have, ah, for fulfilling our basic temperament in everyday life. If we're able to accomplish that and Maslow felt that we're self-actualizing. 

00:21:20
JOHN SIBLEY BUTLER Self-actualization is a, ah, on the one hand it is a, ah, it's an individual variable. 

00:21:25
Archives of the College of St. Catherine, St, Paul, MN. 

00:21:25
KAREN PRAGER Actualization also means that we want to actualize our gifts, uhm, which is what he means when he talks about self-actualization. Uhm, actualization is a generalized need that we have. To fulfill needs, to actualize our wants, to be the best possible me that I can be. Uhm, and self-actualization is like the pinnacle of that process. 

00:21:55
EDWARD HOFFMAN Also Maslow pointed out that self-actualization is a need that human beings have which is contributing to the world. To leave the world a better place than when we came here. 

00:22:10
Esteem Archives of Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute, Warm Springs GA 

00:22:10
SHIELA M. SMITH I think we can only give substandard care until we're able to actualize ourselves. 

00:22:15
EDWARD HOFFMAN When we look at a person's background, we need to look at the ways that their needs are met or not met in their particular culture. 

00:22:25
JOHN SIBLEY BUTLER We know that there are certain people who actualize themselves and other people do not. One of the big mysteries of the world. 

00:22:35
SHIELA M. SMITH The difference between a peaceful death and an anxiety ridden death is the difference in actualization and non-actualized. 

00:22:40
EDWARD HOFFMAN It's very important to have peak experiences in life. Ah, these are moments of great joy and happiness. 

00:22:50
RAJ RAGHUNATHAN To me, ah, it, it speaks to, uhm, fundamentally the issue of spiritual progress. 

00:22:55
Archives of the College of St. Catherine, St, Paul, MN. Esteem Archives of Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute, Warm Springs GA 

00:22:55
SHIELA M. SMITH People do, uhm, get in touch with their self-actualization needs, ah, more prominently in hospice care than any other time that I've seen as a nurse. I think it's because now they have a timeline. Before when we're walking through life accomplishing our goals, meeting our needs. Uhm, doing all the things that are ambitious self ha-- has asked us to do. We don't believe it's ever gonna end. 

00:23:30
Application of the Hierarchy of Needs 

00:23:35
KAREN PRAGER I think that the way Maslow's hierarchy of needs can be applied best for us is for each of us to be aware that we have all of these needs and that we need to take care of them and look after them in order of have a life that is self actualizing at least some of the time. 

00:23:55
Abraham Maslow 1908 - 1970 

00:23:55
EDWARD HOFFMAN I think Maslow's own life is a very inspiring model for how we can look at our own psychological needs and we can work on them and find fulfillment, ah, and move up the pyramid that he suggested. 

00:24:10
JOHN SIBLEY BUTLER His hierarchy needs can help us not only to be better people but at the end of the day it is also the fundamental beginning of helping other people. 

00:24:20
RAJ RAGHUNATHAN The need that's gonna be mainly in focus depends on a bunch of characteristics including the state of the economy, the person's characteristics. Kind of part of category it is, kind of part of product it is. 

00:24:30
SHIELA M. SMITH We need to see the whole picture and Maslow gives us the whole picture. All we have to do is asked the questions and fill in the blanks. 

00:24:35
EDWARD HOFFMAN One of the great psychological challenges for us is to use this, uhm, model as a way to create a better society.
