Sex & Ageing Overcoming The Obstacles To Maintaining a Vital Sex Life with Ted Chapin, Ph.D. and Lori Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:00:00
TED CHAPIN  Hi! My name is Dr. Ted Chapin. I'm a licensed psychologist and a licensed marriage and family therapist in private practice. This is my wife, Lori. 

00:00:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hi! My name is Dr. Lori Russell-Chapin. I'm a professor at Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, and a licensed counselor in private practice with Ted and Barb. 

00:00:40
TED CHAPIN We are very excited about talking on the topic of Sex and Ageing, overcoming the obstacles to maintaining a vital sex life. In general, sexuality is a topic that is often unexplored and not openly discussed, and sex and ageing is rarely discussed. 

00:00:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN We invited three additional helping professionals to join us. Barb Peters, Johnny Compton, and Becky Schroeder. We'll all facilitate this open forum about ageing, sex, cultural expectations, and myths. Gender differences and physical changes due to ageing will also be investigated. Suggestions for expression of a vital sex life will be addressed. The five of us do not believe in any way that we are experts in the area of sex and ageing. Of course, we kinda joke and say we all are kinda old but anyway, uhm what we do believe that these discussions are very necessary and, and extremely important. Before we get started though, I would like for Barb and Johnny and Becky to please introduce themselves. Barb. 

00:01:35
BARB PETERS Hi! I'm Barb Peters. I'm... (crosstalk) 

00:01:40
UNKNOWN Uhm. 

00:01:40
BARB PETERS ...uhm, a Masters of Counseling Psychology graduate from Arizona State University in Illinois. I'm a licensed clinical professional counselor, and I've recently gotten a certification in Gerontology. And I am a senior. 

00:01:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And Barb, also are you single at this point? 

00:01:55
BARB PETERS I am single. (crosstalk) 

00:01:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Si, single at this. (crosstalk) 

00:01:55
BARB PETERS ...have been for about the last 22 years. 

00:01:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Great. I'm so glad that you could join us. Thanks, Barb. 

00:02:00
BARB PETERS Thank you. 

00:02:00
JOHNNY COMPTON Hi! 

00:02:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Johnny. 

00:02:00
JOHNNY COMPTON Hi! I'm Johnny Compton. Ah, I have my Masters in Human develop, Development and Counseling from Bradley University. I worked at a state prison, ah, 11 plus years as a counselor. Uhm, I also ah, counseled ah, inmates. Ah, some of them were seniors, and they expressed their uhm, sexual beliefs in, on, and ah, ageing. I'm also active in the church. Ah, I work there with seniors and ah, talk a lot to seniors about their sexual beliefs and ah, on ageing. 

00:02:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN  And Johnny, you told us too that you are not married right now, but you do have children. Is that correct? 

00:02:35
JOHNNY COMPTON Right. I'm single. I'm a, and I'm also a senior. 

00:02:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Great. Thank you for joining us. 

00:02:40
JOHNNY COMPTON Thank you. 

00:02:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Becky. 

00:02:40
BECKY SCHROEDER I'm Becky Schroeder. I'm a registered nurse and have been for 26 years. I have a Bachelors degree. Uhm, I work for OSF Healthcare System in Proctor Hospital, and have worked with the ah, geriatric population for a number of years. And I am a lesbian and have been in a steady relationship for almost 12 years. 

00:03:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, thank you so much Becky for joining us. Ted? (laughs) Do you wanna introduce yourself again? No? 

00:03:10
TED CHAPIN I already did. 

00:03:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay. All right. The only thing I want to say is that Ted and I have been married, and we've been married now for 17 years, and uhm, celebrating our 17th anniversary on Friday. So thanks for joining us. I appreciate that. 

00:03:20
TED CHAPIN Happy anniversary. 

00:03:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Thank you very much. Uhm, and before we get started talking a little about ages and then cultural myths, uhm, I thought I'd tell us just a fun story 'coz I think it really talks about this whole video in general. Uhm, I was pretty naive about sexuality, and ah, when Ted and I finally got married, and I think on one of our first nights, we were about to make love and Ted said to me, "Would you like to turn on the lights and, and maybe, and we could talk too", and I said, "Oh, we can't turn on the lights and we certainly can't talk". (laughs) So, I think that's what this video, this discussion video DVD is all about. It's about turning on the lights. It's about talking uhm, and really opening up, make this ah, a forum that will educate people about ageing and sexuality. So Barb I'll think I'll turn it over to you and, and if you could begin please. 

00:04:00
Barb Peters, MC, LCPC 

00:04:00
BARB PETERS Well, I think uhm, we as a nation equate sex or sexuality with youth and beauty. You could take a look at our advertisements, ah, they talk about the perfect body, the perfect hair, the perfect ah, make up, the perfect clothes, and certainly that you need to be young if you're going to be interested in a, in active sex life. And I think that that would probably put a lot of pressure on seniors to feel that they just don't measure up. (crosstalk) 

00:04:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:04:30
BARB PETERS  We don't, we don't deserve to, to be thinking... (crosstalk) 

00:04:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:04:35
BARB PETERS ...about this. 

00:04:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN So, since we don't look like the advertisements, then there must be something wrong. 

00:04:40
BARB PETERS Right. 

00:04:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay. Thanks. Johnny. 

00:04:40
JOHNNY COMPTON  Okay. Uhm, depression ah, from ah, life changes are accepted as normal. This is something as you say it is a myth ah, we think of seniors uhm, ah, they should be depressed. This is part of the normal process and it is not part of the normal process just 'coz ah, depression has nothing to do with age. (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:05:05
JOHNNY COMPTON And the seniors that I have talked to, is, it's okay to believe(ph) this way... (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:05:10
Johnny Compton, MA 

00:05:10
JOHNNY COMPTON ...and this has a lot to do with their uhm, uhm, desire to have sex and have a, a normal sex life. Also, uhm, I wanted to talk about uhm, ah, discussing ah, uhm, sex with health care providers. Uhm, most of the health care providers, they haven't been educated or trained to ah, get into this subject in a uhm, ah, caring way with seniors, you know, to get to know them first and get their trust, and the seniors are not about to open up to them... (crosstalk) 

00:05:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:05:40
JOHNNY COMPTON ...and uhm, you know, you know, discuss this, so this is a problem also. 

00:05:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN  So one of the things we're talking about as we're making our discussion is that, ah, an ex, an, the example I gave was my mom who is almost 90 now... (crosstalk) 

00:05:50
JOHNNY COMPTON Uh hmm. 

00:05:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...uhm, and my father's been dead for 25 years, a male nurse came into our room and I was telling Becky this earlier today, and mother was mo, just mortified because this male nurse wanted to give her a bath and, and I think that's the kind of thing we want to educate people to understand that many of the seniors have not, I mean that's just not the cultured way, and to be very respectful. And I think that in the beginning, this nurse was a little offended and I, I, I was glad I was there because I said to him, "You know, this is isn't, it's nothing about you. It's that my mom is nervous." And, and it's really nice because they have this relationship now, this very professional relationship but it took, well it's taken six months. (crosstalk) 

00:06:25
JOHNNY COMPTON Uh hmm. 

00:06:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN So I think that is something, Johnny, that we have to really uhm, aware of. 

00:06:30
JOHNNY COMPTON Right. 

00:06:30
Becky Schroeder, RN, BS 

00:06:30
BECKY SCHROEDER Lori, I think one of the others things, as far as healthcare professionals are concerned is, you know, they are looked at like the all-knowing. You know... (crosstalk) 

00:06:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hmm. 

00:06:40
BECKY SCHROEDER ...you should be comfortable with everything, but they have their own hidden agenda. So if they're not comfortable with their own sexuality, it's very difficult for them to relate, whether it be on the senior level or any level. 

00:06:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, I think you're bringing up another... (crosstalk) 

00:06:50
BECKY SCHROEDER So. 

00:06:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...good point though, that often in our education, I mean I'd never taken a, a sexuality course, but to really talk, and many helping professionals have not had a course in sexuality and how... (crosstalk) 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:07:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...to deal with the, the elderly. Well, my mother says, "Don't call me old. Call me older." Ah, deal with the older population so I'm, I think you're absolutely correct. 

00:07:10
BARB PETERS Another thing uhm, is that some cultures and some religions actually teach that sexuality or uhm, should be over when the age of reproduction is passed. (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:07:20
BARB PETERS That if, you know, that's what's it for and, and if you can't ah, reproduce, then you shouldn't be doing it. (crosstalk) 

00:07:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:07:30
JOHNNY COMPTON Uh hmm. 

00:07:30
BARB PETERS And that's actually taught by some, some cultures and some religions, and, uhm it's too bad. 

00:07:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN  And I, and I think one of the things we're trying to say today in this open forum is that we wanna be respectful of everyone's views about ageing and sexuality, (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:07:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN but to educate people and let them know that if you want to maintain a vital sex life, that it's okay, if it follows your beliefs, and to better understand some of the ways that we can make it more vital, I think. 

00:07:50
TED CHAPIN In addition to Barb's comment, uhm, I mean people who are interested in sex as they aged might be labeled as abnormal or unusual, the dirty old man (laughs) or the loose woman... (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:08:00
TED CHAPIN ...kind of syndrome. And that's really unfortunate because we do maintain our sexual interest. And our culture and our society someti, somehow just cannot uhm, seem to come to terms with that very easily. 

00:08:10
Ageism & Cultural Expectations Associate beauty, sex & attraction with youth. Assume sex life is over after age of reproduction. Continuing interest is "abnormal" and causes guilt and anxiety for fear of being labeled "dirty old man or loose woman." Normal physical decline creates inadequacy. Depression from life changes accepted as normal. Difficult to discuss with uniformed health care providers. 

00:08:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN You know, and I, and, and I hope all of us will join in but I have some great stories. My mom called me not too long ago and told me that uhm, a, a gentleman that I've known all my life is now in the same nursing home as my mom, right next door. And uhm and he'd, and actually mom and Hank, I think they maybe went on a date once 20 years ago, (laughs) but after my father had died, and he asked mom to come in and you know nursing home rooms are really tiny and so mother came in and the only place to sit was on this little bed, (crosstalk) 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:08:40
Lori Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:08:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN and he put his arms around her and mother called me that night and said, "Ma(ph), Lori, I have to tell you something. He put his arms around me, a, and then he kissed me on the cheek", and my mother was just mortified. And I, I think maybe if somehow we can let people know that that's okay and I said to mom, "Mom, I don't think he was doing anything. He probably was just, you know, giving you a welcoming hug," but she really, and she was cute 'coz she said, "Well, that could have led to something else." (laughs). 

00:09:00
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:09:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And I, you know, I said, "Mom, I don't think that was his intention," but again, it's nothing that we talk about and so I think that's sort of again the purpose of our discussion today. So what that lead us to our, our three, I think cultural myths. Ah, one of them is that, as you said Barb that we're not sexually capable, which is not true. That we're not desirous and that we're not desirable. So I think all those myths and all of us have, have said that those things are not to(ph), true and our job today is to kind of get rid of those myths and provide some better suggestions. So I think what we'll do first before we get into this vital suggestion part is talk a little bit about gender differences. And uhm, Johnny, I guess I'll start with you talking about some gender differences in males. 

00:09:45
JOHNNY COMPTON Okay. Ah, in the males, ah, the males they peak at 18. The hormone, they have a hormone drop at 30, uhm, are half as active ah, 40 to 50 years of age and ah, common erectile dysfunctions within the 60's and 40 percent of this may be psychological. So these are some of the differences in the, in the males. A lot of people think that uhm, erectile dysfunction is uhm, is all physical and, you know, 40 percent of it psychological. So just change in their, just, just educating them would do, would make them, (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:10:20
JOHNNY COMPTON make this a lot better. 

00:10:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN But there are a lot of changes that men are going through a, as we age and develop. 

00:10:25
JOHNNY COMPTON Right. 

00:10:25
BARB PETERS Well, quite different for women. Women... (crosstalk) 

00:10:25
JOHNNY COMPTON Uh hmm. 

00:10:25
BARB PETERS ...typically uhm, supposedly peak between 27 and 32 years of age, and their hormonal decline is, is much more gradual. Uhm, they go through menopause typically from 45 to 55 years of age, and they have an interest at least in ah, their orgasm capacity all the way through their life. 

00:10:45
JOHNNY COMPTON Uh hmm. 

00:10:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN  See, I think that those uhm, facts are so interesting because look at, even if we're not changing, just look at the conflict that we have because our bodies are changing at different times. (crosstalk) 

00:10:55
BARB PETERS Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:10:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN So that's why that creates some problems just right off the bat. Uhm, let's talk a little bit about uhm, maybe some physical changes due to ageing in men, Ted. 

00:11:05
TED CHAPIN Well, there are many physical changes that you know, men experience and many, most of these are very subtle and, and not immediately obvious to men, but these include less testosterone, uhm, less sperm and seminal fluid, uhm, a longer time to erection and ejaculation, uhm, reduced size of the erection, reduced ejaculatory force, uhm, increased time for the refractory period. Now the refractory period is a time after orgasm before a man is able to have an erection again. And the differences here, it might be minutes to hours for men when they're younger, and it could be hours to a day (laughs) for men who are older. So there's quite a bit of a difference there. Uhm, the size of their ah, penis is less than it would have been when they were younger, and they can also have increased prostate. So many of these physical ah, ah, changes occur for men. 

00:12:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN See there's a part of me, as, as I listen to everyone talk, that says well, that's just kinda sad. And you know, I think what we're trying to say is it's a normal development and that we're gonna be giving some ideas of ways that we can help, I think uhm, better understand those changes. 

00:12:10
TED CHAPIN  These are normal changes and they do happen very slowly, but you're right. The consequence emotionally is after a while, men could begin to feel doubtful... (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:12:20
TED CHAPIN ...or perhaps inadequate. (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:12:20
TED CHAPIN  Or apprehensive about approaching... (crosstalk) 

00:12:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:12:25
TED CHAPIN ...sexuality because somehow, it's not the same. It's, it doesn't seem quite the same or as pleasurable and ah, there's anxiety present. 

00:12:30
Physical Changes due to Ageing Females: Lubrication and vaginal expansiveness. Dramatic sexual tension & orgasmic contraction. 

00:12:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And so again, we're gonna try to provide some suggestions, perhaps later on ways that we can maybe decrease some of that anxiety. Women go through the same, very si, si, very similar changes. Uhm, there's a drop in estrogen. Uhm, as estrogen drops, there tends to be a thinning of the vaginal wall which sometimes makes intercourse more difficult. We'll talk about some ways to get around that. Uhm, but Barb, you said this so nicely but there still, women can maintain and have wonderful orgasms. They can have multiple orgasms but foreplay is so important to females. What I find interesting and we'll talk more about this as we get into suggestion but, you know, we always heard that women want, need more foreplay I think when they're younger than men, but I think what happens as we age is men kinda catch up with us, (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:13:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN and they then need more foreplay. We'll talk a little bit about that uhm, when we get into vital suggestions as well. Uhm, and we talked about size of penis but the size of the organs certainly decrease. And then Becky, you and I were talking about that there are some external changes that you think have to be talked about and addressed as well. 

00:13:30
Becky Schroeder, RN, BS 

00:13:30
BECKY SCHROEDER There's, you know, besides the, the internal or, or organ size and all that psychological things that go with that, there's also external things. You know, women are supposed to be voluptuous, and as Barb was talking about (laughs) young, and men are supposed to be the studly dudleys as we used to call them, (laughs) you know, when I was in college and, and really buff and big chest but, you know, the things that, that go with ageing too are you gain weight, you get gray hair, you no longer feel physically appealing to look at. (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:14:00
BECKY SCHROEDER So therefore, there's, there's an apprehension that way too. Am I going to be desirable just like... (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh(ph). 

00:14:05
BECKY SCHROEDER ...you had mentioned? (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:14:05
BECKY SCHROEDER So I think we need to take that into consideration too. 

00:14:10
Lori Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:14:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, and Becky, ah, and I'm probably the only here so far telling these stories, but uhm, thi, this is a little bit embarrassing, but I think this may proves exactly why we need to have such discussions. And it makes me laugh at this, but uhm, now I remember I told you my mom is almost 90, and not too long ago, I found a gray pubic hair. And honestly, I'd, I didn't know I'm, I'm a pretty educated female. I didn't know, I mean I knew my hair was gonna turn gray on my head, (laughs) but I didn't think about my pubic hair turning gray. And so I raced to the phone, and I called my mom and I said, "Mom!" now she's almost 90, "Mom, I have a gray pubic hair. You didn't tell me I was gonna have gray pubic hair". And my mom was great. She said, "Well, I don't know that, Lori. Let me get off the phone," and she said, "I'll check". (laughs) So she hangs up, she gets off the phone and about, I don't know, ten minutes later she calls back and she said, "Yup! Yup, Lori, I have gray pubic hair". And, and I just thought it was a great story because those are changes that we just don't talk about, and I think that if we all would know that, uhm, i, it wouldn't be so quite so dramatic. (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:15:05
BECKY SCHROEDER Right. 

00:15:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I mean, with men's hair in their chest gray, and I, I suppose you don't like that. Well, I don't, maybe you don't know what I mean. Do you have gray (laughs) hair on your chest? 

00:15:15
TED CHAPIN (laughs) I have a lot of gray hair on my chest to begin with. 

00:15:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN So I think those are things that we really have to be aware of, so. Okay. As(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:15:20
BARB PETERS Well, you know, this last month ah, in the AARP bulletin uhm, the May issue, there's a new Dr. Ruth from Canada and her name is Sue, and she's an R.N. 

00:15:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Exactly. Yeah. 

00:15:30
BARB PETERS And uhm, she's saying that if, if a man and woman meet and uhm, the woman might say, you know, I've got this wrinkled body, or I'm a little bit overweight, or just be out front with it and say, you know, I'm not feeling very attractive uhm, and the guy, this would let the man off the hook and he could say, you know, I'm not feeling very attractive... (crosstalk) 

00:15:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Me too. 

00:15:55
BECKY SCHROEDER Okay. 

00:15:55
BARB PETERS I got the same problem... (crosstalk) 

00:15:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:15:55
BARB PETERS ...as you have. That, that open communication uhm, before you'd even start a relationship, would, would you know, certainly relax... (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:16:00
BARB PETERS ...both of you. 

00:16:00
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:16:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Barb, I think that's, as we get into those suggestions, I think that's probably one of the big keys we're gonna talk. We people not only have to be educated, but they have to talk about these issues. I mean, it's, I was thinking about this yesterday. It's the, really the one common thing we all have and everyone has in common. We all continue to develop and we probably all of us had so, some sexual activity, so we really need to know about these issues and continue to talk about them. So we've talked a little bit about some myths and cultural expectations. We've talked about physical changes in men and women, some external changes. Ted, let's talk a little bit about uhm, more causes of sexual inactivity. 

00:16:35
Ted Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:16:35
TED CHAPIN  We've already mentioned the physical decline and again, the, the difficulty there is that the decline is not so obvious. It's, it's a very subtle off and over a long period of time. And uhm, the result in couples in, in ah, marriage relationships is that they may uhm, somehow feel less attractive or less motivated... (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:16:55
TED CHAPIN ...or less masculine or feminine, a, and begin to withdraw from sexual activity and turn their attention to other matters in life, their work or their grandchildren, and or their kids, or uhm, volunteer activities. And uhm, after a while, they just sort of taken for granted that somehow sex and their sexual relationship has taken a backstage... (crosstalk) 

00:17:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:17:20
TED CHAPIN ...to, uhm, to their relationship. So physical decline is certainly ah, an important factor, not insurmountable. And we'll talk about some things that uhm, all of us can do to help uhm, ah, balance out the kinds of effects that happen because of ageing. Ah, marital conflict also can be a source of ah, sexual inactivity. Couples who are not happy in their lives together, who are not communicating well, who can't solve their problems very well. Uhm, they're gonna have increased tension and, and conflict and that will uhm, tend to put some distance between their uhm, their sexual relationship. And so, often in marriage counseling uhm, we say that what's happening uhm inside the bedroom is reflective of what's going on... (crosstalk) 

00:18:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:18:00
TED CHAPIN ...outside the bedroom and vice versa... (crosstalk) 

00:18:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:18:00
TED CHAPIN ...and so we wanna pay attention to marital conflict. Uhm, for single persons, uhm, fear of diseases I think is also important. Of course, (crosstalk) 

00:18:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN (inaudible ). 

00:18:09
TED CHAPIN this is the, the time of AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases are still with us, and if we don't know our partner and if we can't talk very openly and clearly with who this person is, who the sexual partner is, that fear could prevent us from being us sexually active as well. And ah, lastly of course, this physical decline uhm, in some ways can cause uhm, decreases in pleasure of the sexual experience. And again, it may be subtle in some ways. In other ways, it may be uhm, very obvious. Uhm, ah, it's not unusual for example, for men to have uhm, some periodic difficulty even in, in younger age uhm, coming to... (crosstalk) 

00:18:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:18:45
TED CHAPIN ...orgasm, but may have more difficulty later on and uhm, that may cause them to feel like sex is not a pleasurable activity anymore, more of a fearful activity, and they withdraw from that. 

00:18:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. But then I think what happens too is that they, male or female, might say, "I've kinda lost interest in sex because it, it isn't quite as pleasurable" or "I don't understand these changes," and we'll talk more about this. But I think oftentimes, then(ph) partners, whether you know, partners say, "Well, I'm, I'm feeling rejected," and ah, and we're back to where we started which is, "Well then, we have to talk about it," because oftentimes, it's really not the rejection of another person, it's I don't understand these changes and I don't know exactly what to do with them. 

00:19:20
TED CHAPIN  And Lori, we had a little bit of experience with this ourselves. If you remember several years ago, I think there were some changes that you were experiencing... (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:19:30
TED CHAPIN ...that was making intercourse painful. And uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Like in the, the drop of e, estrogen, the thinning wall of the vagina, and, and I, and I'm always amazed at this because I feel like I, I really, I've taken courses on sexuality and I, I've, I've talked to my clients many times about this, but it was difficult to talk to you, but I think 'coz I didn't wanna hurt your feelings. And maybe I was embarrassed too, but I, I really didn't wanna hurt your feelings and so it went on way too far, long I think. And finally, I went to my gynecologist and, and he had a simple solution. He gave me some ah, it was a hormone cream, it was topical, and that was it. I mean, but, but if we don't talk about it, we don't have a solution. We can't find a solution. 

00:20:05
TED CHAPIN  And of course on my end, I was wondering why you weren't as interested... (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:20:10
TED CHAPIN ...or why you weren't seeming to enjoy yourself as much, (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:20:15
TED CHAPIN and that explained a lot. 

00:20:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I, I think that brings us Ted to another issue of, and we're gonna talk more about this, but there are so many ways that you can be intimate with people. Intercourse doesn't have to be one. And, and, and Becky, you're saying, you know, that's a very different situation for someone like, who is in a homosexual relationship. So I think that we're gonna talk more about uhm, alternate ways of expressing intimacy and sexuality. And I, I think that's gonna be really important to us. So let's keep it, let's keep going. Uhm, ee've talked again about uhm, expectations. We're talking about gender differences. We're talking about the reasons and causes behind sexual in, inactivity. Barb, I think you probably have some, some more reasons for inactivity. 

00:20:55
Barb Peters, MC, LCPC 

00:20:55
BARB PETERS Well, obviously health problems. Uhm, as we age, unfortunately more things happen and, and uhm, there can be uhm, open heart surgeries, there can be ah, cancers, there can be ah, hypertension, there can be, even later in life, dementia, ah, all reasons why a person would lose their interest in, in sexuality. And I want to talk about medication and the side effects of medication. 

00:21:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:21:30
BARB PETERS If you are interested in an active sex life, talk it over with your doctor. Uhm, a great many people are on cardiovascular medications, ah, antidepressants, ah, hypertension medications; all of these have side effects that affect your sex life, your libido. They are even looking at it from the opposite viewpoint uhm, ah, L-Dopa for ah, Parkinson's disease increases your sexual activity and desire, and so this can be a problem in the, in the reverse ah, way. You know, it, (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
UNKNOWN Oh(ph). 

00:22:05
BARB PETERS it's, it's upsetting to the relationship. 

00:22:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And if you don't talk about it again... (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
BARB PETERS  Exactly. 

00:22:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...this is the same kind of problem. 

00:22:10
BARB PETERS So tell your doctor that uhm, I am interested in the potential side effects of this medication, and I would like you to prescribe something that is not going to affect my sex life, and you can do your own research. So many people are getting on the internet now... (crosstalk) 

00:22:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm 

00:22:25
BARB PETERS ...and reading about, they come in and almost know more than the doctor when they come in. Uhm, so, so being conscious that the medications that you take will definitely cause side effects that, that can be uhm, prohibited. And another thing is ah, poor adjustment to retirement. People are, are retiring, and you can understand that maybe they have been in a position that, that made them feel important or, and worthy and, and needed, and all of a sudden that's gone, and you're kind of at loose ends and, and you're not feeling too good about yourself that can affect your self esteem. And so consequently, that could very easily be carried into the bedroom and, and you don't feel, you know, you don't feel very powerful. You don't... (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:23:10
BARB PETERS  feel very sexy anymore. So, ah, taking your retirement and making it the best of your life, it's, it's a time when you can have a, a wonderful time and, and rediscover love in a new way, and, and really work on the relationship that you're in, and, and ah, and be very happy. Ah, it just takes the effort that, that you ah, put into it. 

00:23:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN But Barb, you know, and we're gonna keep talking about these suggestions, but it keeps coming back to one of the same points where people have to be willing to talk about it, ah, even if to say I'm embarrassed. And then I think we're gonna get in to this heavily in the suggestions, but if you can't talk about it, find a counselor. Find a helping professional who, who might be able to mediate and make it less embarrassing. (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
BARB PETERS Uh hmm. 

00:23:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN So I think all those are such great ideas, Barb. Thanks. You know, I remember uhm, Becky, you mentioned something about your partner having surgery too, and what a difficult time that was. 

00:24:00
BECKY SCHROEDER  It was difficult for both of us. She had open heart surgery uhm, probably about five or six years ago. And uhm, not too long afterwards, we were in ah, an intimate situation and there was no feeling. You know... (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh, no sensation. (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
BECKY SCHROEDER ...they cut her chest. (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh. 

00:24:20
BECKY SCHROEDER There was no sensation, you know, at all. And for me, it created a trem, tremendous amount with performance anxiety. (crosstalk) 

00:24:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:24:25
Becky Schroeder, RN, BS 

00:24:25
BECKY SCHROEDER It's like ah, you know, what am I doing wrong, I don't understand this. And for her, it was embarrassing because she no longer could respond. (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hmm. 

00:24:35
BECKY SCHROEDER I mean, there was no sensation. So, uhm, we talked about it. We got over it, and it took a little while, but, but again... (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hmm. 

00:24:40
BECKY SCHROEDER ...it's that communication that's very important. 

00:24:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And my, my guess is that that wasn't something that uhm, a surgeon or someone said to you this might happen. 

00:24:50
UNKNOWN Ah. 

00:24:50
BECKY SCHROEDER Never. (laughs) Uhm, in fact, uhm, I laugh a little bit uhm, because what was discussed was, you know, you can wait two or three weeks and then you can, you know, resume... (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:25:00
BECKY SCHROEDER  sex, ah, your relationship or whatever. (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:25:05
BECKY SCHROEDER But not only because of ah, difficulties uhm, when we talk about our lesbian relationship. Uhm, does the health care provider have, (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hmm. 

00:25:15
BECKY SCHROEDER but it's something that's not known. I mean, they discuss what position you should take in a heterosexual relationship, but they don't go into that in a, in a... (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:25:25
BECKY SCHROEDER ...gay or lesbian relationship because ah, it's just, we don't wanna talk about that. (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:25:30
BECKY SCHROEDER So there were different difficulties and differences there for us also. So we worked through them, (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hmm. 

00:25:35
BECKY SCHROEDER but it took a little bit. 

00:25:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. Well, and I think it goes back to caring enough about your partner, caring amo... (crosstalk) 

00:25:40
BECKY SCHROEDER Exactly. 

00:25:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...about this other person that you say, "I'm, I'm embarrassed or I'm sad or I'm lonely," and then you have to work through that. 

00:25:45
BECKY SCHROEDER Exactly. 

00:25:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Thanks. Thank you, Becky. 

00:25:45
BARB PETERS  I can, I can imagine the fear that would come up too from someone who has had open heart surgery or stroke or something... (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:25:55
BARB PETERS ...thinking, "Oh, if I get too excited, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN Exaclty. 

00:25:55
BARB PETERS I may have another one," you know, so. 

00:26:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. All that apprehension must be there. 

00:26:00
BARB PETERS Yeah. 

00:26:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Johnny, we had talked too a little it about some, some religious concerns that might affect ageing and sexuality. 

00:26:05
Johnny Compton, MA 

00:26:05
JOHNNY COMPTON  Yes. Ah, this is uhm, I think, very important these days because a lot of, a lot of the different therapies and benefits out there known to ah, enjoy ah, you know, healthy sex life is limited by a lot of the people's uhm, religious and uhm, spiritual beliefs. 

00:26:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:26:25
JOHNNY COMPTON And I just gave you uhm, a little some of the adultery. Ah, we talked to them about that. And they had, they'd tell you, well, Exodus 20:14 says, "Thou shall not commit adultery", and uhm, Matthew 5:28 says "What I say unto you that whosoever look for another woman to lust after her has committed adultery already with her in his heart", and then ah, we had a word ah, the fornification known ah, in the course outside the bounds of marriage. Uhm, for the cause of fornification, Matthew 5:32, "And I say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife, saving ah, ah, for the cause of fornification causes her to commit adultery, and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced commit adultery". And this is very big in the African ah, American community. Ah, ah, Church of God and Christ... (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:27:15
JOHNNY COMPTON ...allowed them ah, to fall in love, but to lay your hands on a living(ph) the husband ah, ah, living(ph) wife, they, (crosstalk) 

00:27:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. 

00:27:25
JOHNNY COMPTON but they, they just walk away... (crosstalk) 

00:27:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. 

00:27:25
JOHNNY COMPTON ...they, they go back to this and they said they committed adultery. 

00:27:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN So Johnny, as long as if I understand that though but so, I think all of us as helping professionals uhm, and just people in general have to be aware that our cultural and our religious beliefs... (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
JOHNNY COMPTON Uh hmm. 

00:27:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...often interfere with having a healthy sex life. And so... (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
JOHNNY COMPTON Uh hmm. 

00:27:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...it's gonna be really important as we talk about suggestions that there are other ways I want, 'coz you wanna make sure that I can be consistent with my beliefs, but there are other ways that I can continue to be sexual. (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
JOHNNY COMPTON Right. 

00:27:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uhm, you had mentioned once about maybe taking someone out to dinner... (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
JOHNNY COMPTON Uh hmm. 

00:27:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...holding hands, a kiss on the cheek; those are very intimate and sexual kind of things, and you then can still be consistent with your religious beliefs. 

00:28:00
JOHNNY COMPTON  Right. 

00:28:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN So that's kind of what you're talking about. 

00:28:05
JOHNNY COMPTON Right. (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay. 

00:28:05
JOHNNY COMPTON Those are things they could do and still be comfortable with their beliefs... (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. 

00:28:10
JOHNNY COMPTON ...and still, you know, how to promote a healthy sex life. 

00:28:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. 

00:28:10
JOHNNY COMPTON Uh-hmm. And ah, I think it's good as health professionals to know this and be, you know, very patient with these people. Otherwise, uhm, it's, it's not going to work because that, that that's their beliefs and it, it would take a lot of time to get them to ah, (crosstalk) 

00:28:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:28:25
JOHNNY COMPTON see beyond that. 

00:28:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, then we're going back to the old thing about it and, you know, we're certainly not here today to share, to say this is the way to do it. (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
JOHNNY COMPTON Right. 

00:28:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN We're just talking about this in open forum... (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
JOHNNY COMPTON Uh hmm. 

00:28:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...so we would never wanna, we wanna be nonjudgmental for sure. 

00:28:35
JOHNNY COMPTON Right. Now, another area is ah, embarrassment in talking to the MD's. A lot of the elderly uhm, embarrassed to talk in to the MD's about ah, sexual problems or desires because ah, society views them as not being ah, like we said earlier... (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
JOHNNY COMPTON ...able to ha, have sex, ah, no interest, ah, you know, just, they don't fit the mold as I say, why should I talk to them, I'm not, I'm not fitting the society's...(crosstalk) 

00:29:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
JOHNNY COMPTON ...mold. I, I must be bad ah, to, to do this. The MD's don't ah, make it easy as far as uhm, getting to know them or talking to them in a, in the privacy... (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
JOHNNY COMPTON ...'coz a lot of them haven't been trained to do it. So as healthcare providers, we need to ah, be more patient with the seniors. Ah, cultural expec, expectations to be non ah, sexual. Uhm, seniors are expected to be non, nonsexual. This is a myth. A lot of them are, but they wanna be, ah, they don't want be seen as, as we said earlier, a dirty old man or loose woman... (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
JOHNNY COMPTON ...so they, (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
TED CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:29:35
JOHNNY COMPTON they, they'll suppress it. They wouldn't really even talk to anyone. Ah. 

00:29:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, here's an example. I don't know if you could talk about this, but your mom is working in a nursing home and she's worked there for years. 

00:29:45
TED CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:29:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Remember the discussion you had with her while you were preparing for this? (crosstalk) 

00:29:50
TED CHAPIN Well, I asked my mother, you know, how did the nursing home handle uhm, couples who wanted to be sexually... (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
TED CHAPIN ...active? (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
TED CHAPIN And said, "Oh my gosh. We don't, they don't, (laughs) they don't do that". I mean, it was like, you gotta... (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
TED CHAPIN ...talk about it. Uhm, so she didn't have a good answer for me. I'm not sure... (crosstalk) 

00:30:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:30:05
TED CHAPIN ...if that nursing home uhm, had a plan... 

00:30:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:30:05
Ted Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:30:05
TED CHAPIN ...ah, for how to handle ah, sexual experiences between uhm, residents. 

00:30:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN So I think that's such a shame because what... (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
BARB PETERS Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...we're doing is just that we're saying, "You all cannot be sexual. (crosstalk) 

00:30:15
BARB PETERS Uh hmm. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:30:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN It's done. It's over. Even if you like it or think about it. 

00:30:20
BARB PETERS Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Quit thinking about it." And so I, I think that's really sad. Now, I did talk to someone else who was working in a nursing home and that was, the(ph), they were very interested. They said, "We have a room". 

00:30:25
BARB PETERS  Uh hmm. 

00:30:30
TED CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:30:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN A room. But, but that's the way it was sort of referred to, "It's the room." 

00:30:30
BARB PETERS Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN  You know it's a, we won't talk about it much but I guess I just said, "If you wanna do anything sexual, just go to the room." And you know, here these are (laughs) wise, caring people. So I'm gonna think we're, as a society, we really do have to be, become more progressive in that arena. 

00:30:45
BARB PETERS Uh hmm. 

00:30:45
JOHNNY COMPTON Right. I think it's slowly changing. I know a few nursing homes here in Peoria where, husband and wife, they both were there and uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:30:50
JOHNNY COMPTON  when they have their sexual activity, uhm, uhm, the providers, they just, you know, ignore and later go home. 

00:31:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:31:00
JOHNNY COMPTON Whereas some nursing homes, like you say, they, they are draw them out, so things are all changing, slowly but surely. (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:31:05
JOHNNY COMPTON Ah, one other area is ah, interpretation by women, ah, men's decline as a rejection, a lot of women uhm, they see this as a rejection. They wanna talk to the man, about a lot of, a lot of the women especially in the African-American and ah, culture, that question a man about if he's having problems, that's like a put down. Ah, 

00:31:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN So it'll be disrespectful. 

00:31:25
JOHNNY COMPTON disrespectful, (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hmm. 

00:31:25
JOHNNY COMPTON If you question my authority. And rather than risk that, they just go alone and... (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
JOHNNY COMPTON ...be unhappy, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
JOHNNY COMPTON It takes education on to men and the women's brought it to uhm, bring about a change... 

00:31:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
JOHNNY COMPTON ...but this is, this culture thing is harder, hard to change. 

00:31:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Johnny, I think, but I think you know, this is an interesting one not only uhm, when we talk about, that women might see men's decline as a rejection. I think sometimes men's see women's decline as, as rejection as well... (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
TED CHAPIN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...and we're back to where we started, 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN you gotta keep talking about... (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
JOHNNY COMPTON Right. (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...these issues. Or if it's partner-to-partner, you have to keep talking whether you're male... (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
BECKY SCHROEDER It's(ph) okay(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...or female... 

00:31:55
JOHNNY COMPTON Uh hmm. 

00:31:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...about these issues. So uhm, we're gonna do suggestions, we're gonna have to really uhm, emphasize that a lot. We've been talking a lot about causes and, and physical changes, let's move into the part about, maybe some benefits of, benefits of being vital as we are older and in sex life. Johnny, how about if I start with you? 

00:32:15
JOHNNY COMPTON Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN What are some benefits? 

00:32:15
JOHNNY COMPTON Ah, some benefits; emotional and self-expression. 

00:32:20
Self-worth and meaning Pleasure and sensual development 

00:32:20
JOHNNY COMPTON It's just like you said uhm, they found that couples that had a healthy sex life, uhm, they had uhm, they, they didn't have as much emotional distress uhm, 

00:32:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:32:25
JOHNNY COMPTON  and they had a lot better physical health, you know, especially with the heart and the high blood pressure... 

00:32:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
JOHNNY COMPTON ...and things like that. 

00:32:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN So... (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
JOHNNY COMPTON It's proven. 

00:32:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...so the research is showing as that it is actually uhm, better for our well-being if we will continue to have a vital sex life. 

00:32:40
JOHNNY COMPTON Yes. Uh-huh. 

00:32:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Ted and I went to see a wonderful movie last week, ah, it was called "The Notebook." (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
JOHNNY COMPTON Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And it's not gonna be, I mean, probably unfortunately, they're not gonna get Academy awards, but it's this lovely story about a couple who was uhm, married forever and, and for a very long time, I can't remember if they are 50 years or something. 

00:33:00
TED CHAPIN A long time. 

00:33:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN But she then got Alzheimer's, and uhm, and he was just convinced that if he stayed with her and worked with her and coached her, that she would have moments of clarity, and and of course the doctors kept saying it's is not true. And but ah, in the movie, of course, he does and probably you'd notice Becky maybe he can't do this, but she would have like five seconds or five minutes of clarity and she would remember him, 

00:33:20
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:33:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN and during that five minutes of clarity, they would dance and they would hold hands and he would play favorite music for them. But in the end, it was this powerful love story about coming together and, and loving one another and being sexual with one another, and then, dying together. 

00:33:35
BARB PETERS Uh hmm. 

00:33:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And it was just, it's, it was a powerful story... (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...about, I think sexuality and ageing. So we, I think, and, and I'd love those kind of movies because it too educates, but I'm not sure a lot of people are gonna see it because it, 

00:33:45
JOHNNY COMPTON Right. (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN it's like, "Oh, it's uncomfortable." (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:33:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN  So I think, we're doing a good thing. 

00:33:50
BECKY SCHROEDER Well, and if you look at Nancy and Ronald Reagan, 

00:33:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hmm. 

00:33:50
BECKY SCHROEDER one of the things... (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
BARB PETERS Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
BECKY SCHROEDER ...that happened is the last moment before he died. They had a powerful love between them. He became clear and looked her... (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
BECKY SCHROEDER ...right in the eyes, basically said, "I love you," and that was it. 

00:34:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And he hadn't had that clarity for a long time. (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
BECKY SCHROEDER That's right. That's right. (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Isn't that something. So I, I think we're back to this, how important it is that we let people know that ageing is okay and sexuality is okay. So Johnny has talked a little bit about some vital sex life benefits. Barb, how about for you? 

00:34:15
BARB PETERS Well, uhm, I like the rebellion against the stereotypes. I've been a rebellious person all my life (laughs) and if I can, if I can rebel and, and say, ah, you know, what you say about seniors is not necessarily true. Uhm, I personally may not be sexually active at that age, not that I wouldn't like to be, but uhm, finding a partner, it's, it's cute, it's just finding a partner with working parts, is the problem. (laughs) But I plan on being out there mowing my loan when I'm 81 or 85 and, and you know it's just like kind of fun to say, "What you say is not necessarily true." 

00:34:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, you have a great book too. What's the book that you've been reading Barb. (crosstalk). 

00:34:55
BARB PETERS Oh! "Being an Outrageous Older Woman," yeah. It's, it's written by Ruth Harris Jacobs, ah, Ph.D. And ah, I'll refer to some things she says later and, and, uhm, but it's just a great book on, on, be, go ahead and be outrageous and, and don't worry about what people say, that you're a loose woman or a, 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:35:10
BARB PETERS a dirty old man, (crosstalk) 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:35:10
BARB PETERS you know, it's okay. 

00:35:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN  There's a, years ago, when I had this (inaudible ) in our house, but it's the, it's, it's about women who wear red... 

00:35:20
BARB PETERS Oh! 

00:35:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...and women who wear purple. 

00:35:20
BARB PETERS Uh hmm. 

00:35:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And it's that kind of the same thing that you know, as we get older, what is important for us to continue to be enthusiastic and optimistic about the future and do things that we wanna do and one of my favorite lines is, there is, "I might just choose to sit on the street and spit." (laughs) I thought that was so good. 

00:35:30
BARB PETERS  Well everybody out at the office knows I belong to the Red Hat Society and we wear purple dresses and red hats... (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN  I love it. (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
BARB PETERS ...and go out and have nothing, but fun. 

00:35:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Outrageous fun. 

00:35:40
BARB PETERS Outrageous fun. (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I love it. So it's, it's more benefits. Ted, how about for you, Benefits of a vital sex life? 

00:35:45
TED CHAPIN Well, I think as a marriage and family therapist, what strikes me is that if the sexual relationship is alive and active, uhm, the partnership and the intimacy, the emotional closeness is going to be alive and active. And... 

00:35:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hmm. 

00:35:55
TED CHAPIN ...being able to share life, uhm, its joys and its challenges and being able to communicate those kind of deep feelings, it's much easier when you're physically connected with another person. So definitely, that would be a benefit of a vital sex life... 

00:36:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hmm. 

00:36:10
TED CHAPIN ...maintaining that intimacy and that closeness in a relationship. 

00:36:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. You see, but I think this, then one of the benefits I see is, maybe it's very connected to yours which is that it also gives me that feeling of meaning, that I can have meaning with someone else and I can have meaning with myself, I think that's really important. Uhm, and I do, you know we haven't said this much, but I think the other benefit is it feels good. I mean, I mean... (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...if the largest organ in our body is our skin, I mean, and we're gonna talk more about alternative ways to express sex, but just to be touched is, is a lovely thing. And I know occasionally and I know this is controversial, but sometimes in therapy, I know someone really needs a hug and so I, I will say to you, "I'd like to give you a hug, would that be okay with you?" And you know that's real controversial, but sometimes when I give people hugs, they just collapse because they'll say things like, "Do you know the last time I was touched was years... (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
BARB PETERS Hmm. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And so, I think there this feeling of, uhm, that, that it does, it's sensual, it does feel good whether it's a sexual organ or just being touched on the arm. Uhm, I think all those things are just really important, but it gives us a sense of self-worth, and I think that's, that's just really important. Becky, you had mentioned too, uhm, this whole idea of a higher plane, uhm, when we're talking about vital sex lives. 

00:37:20
BECKY SCHROEDER  You know, a lot of times, uhm, when you're talking about giving someone a hug and, and that, you know, when we're taught in science classes or psych classes or whenever in school, there is this space that you don't cross. (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh. Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
BARB PETERS Yes. 

00:37:40
BECKY SCHROEDER You know, so when you allow someone to get into that space and trust them enough to do that, it is a wonderful feeling, and it does take that mentally to a, to a different level... 

00:37:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
BECKY SCHROEDER ...not just sexually, but mentally also. 

00:37:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:37:55
BECKY SCHROEDER So, you know, for me it's everything. Uhm, and when I say everything, I don't mean the physical part, but it's my whole outlook on life itself... 

00:38:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:38:05
BECKY SCHROEDER ...you know, how I approach someone, how I talk to someone, how I would deal with a conflict. Uhm, yo, you know, it gives me a more positive outlook. 

00:38:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. And I think it does. I mean, and I think we're talking just about, maybe expanding the definition of intimacy. I think maybe that's the mistake that we make, is that we say, "Intimacy is sex". But I think that's a part of it, but it's much, much greater and I think that's what you're talking about when you, (crosstalk) 

00:38:25
BECKY SCHROEDER  Right. (crosstalk) 

00:38:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN takes it to a different level. 

00:38:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN We spent a lot of time now talking about changes and, and why we believe that the sex life is vital. Uhm, ah, it's time to get into the meat of this and we're gonna talk about suggestions to the vital sex life. Way's that we can make- 

00:38:40
Arrange alone time & explore new technique. Address problems that decrease sexual interest. Consider hormone replacement therapy. If alone, develop new social networks. Discuss health issues & keep sexually active. Talk about SIDs and practice safe sex. Develop and nurture non-sexual relationship. Speak with clergy about religious-based inhibitions. Relax and have fun. 

00:38:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN - uhm, sex and ageing, I think more exciting and, and uhm, and more beneficial. So Johnny, let's, let's have you start with this please, your thoughts. 

00:38:50
JOHNNY COMPTON Okay uhm. Communicate and talk openly. As we said earlier, ah, it's the little things that matter. Uhm, just get it out there and talk, you know, if something's bothering you. Uhm, a lot of people would ask, "What's, what's your wife's favorite color?" And he had draw a blank. (crosstalk) (laughs) 

00:39:05
BECKY SCHROEDER That's(ph) right(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
JOHNNY COMPTON You know, the little things, (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
UNKNOWN Change(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
JOHNNY COMPTON go back and, and learn it. Ah, get to reattached to that ah, to get, you know ah, reconnect. Ah, "What's your husband's favorite desert?" I don't know. 

00:39:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:39:15
JOHNNY COMPTON You should know. You know, 

00:39:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:39:15
JOHNNY COMPTON a li, it's the little things just ah, just to go ahead and talk and communicate and, and if the person is not married, they can do it with uhm, just uhm, a, a partner. (crosstalk) 

00:39:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:39:25
JOHNNY COMPTON There's other things to do, go see a movie together, uh, and I like this one speak with the clergy about religious-based inhibitions, because uhm, uhm, as long as they think that they're going down the wrong path, you know, not just too much is gonna help. Even though a lot of new therapies out there and uh, resources so that's very important to talk to their ah, 

00:39:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:39:45
JOHNNY COMPTON ...minister, their leader, and ah, try to get something and hopefully uhm, the leaders will get more educated themselves now... 

00:39:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. 

00:39:55
JOHNNY COMPTON ...so they're not putting things okay. The Bible does say this, but this is the Old Testament and we have a New Testament now.(crosstalk) 

00:40:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
JOHNNY COMPTON So they're letting them know there is another way, you know... 

00:40:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN To do that? (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
JOHNNY COMPTON  Now you don't have to go by this concrete rule. 

00:40:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well Johnny, you know, as, you know, you talked about how sometimes it would be difficult for an African-American male... 

00:40:10
JOHNNY COMPTON Uh-hmm. 

00:40:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...or especially a female to question or maybe talk to his or her partner about that. 

00:40:15
JOHNNY COMPTON Right. 

00:40:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN As an African-American male, what would, I mean, how would you encourage someone to go about doing that? Because you're saying this a little bit difficult. 

00:40:20
JOHNNY COMPTON  I will say uhm, get to know them, see a movie together, go to dinner, do, do the small things first rather than just coming out and, 

00:40:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And talking about it. (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
JOHNNY COMPTON and talking about it. There has to be a gradual process. (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN But to take the risks and to develop a relationship. 

00:40:35
JOHNNY COMPTON Right, 'coz it's, it's well worth it. 

00:40:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay. Thanks Johnny. Ted, how about for you. 

00:40:40
TED CHAPIN Well, to add something to what Johnny said, (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
TED CHAPIN I think if there is trouble communicating and talking, and Lori, I think you mentioned this earlier too, don't hesitate to see a therapist... 

00:40:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
Ted Chaplin, Ph.D. 

00:40:50
TED CHAPIN ...or bring those concerns to the minister also and have a third party uhm, help you talk and listen, and do some problem solving because a lot of progress can be made for those communication problems, just with a third party helping. 

00:41:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. 

00:41:00
TED CHAPIN  Uhm, another thing that I think is important is to help maintain a vital sex life, uhm, if you are experiencing some problems with disinterest in, in, uhm, sex or uh finding it is not as pleasurable as it used to be, do all you can not to crawl away and hide and feel, and somehow inadequate about that. Talk about it with your partner. Uhm, talk about it with your physician. Uhm, bring those issues forward because a lot can be done today to help those things. I remembered an experience I went through several years ago. Uhm, I was noticing a tenderness in my chest and I had been building some cabinets, and at first I attributed it to maybe some bruise or something I had... (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
TED CHAPIN ...but it persisted. And I thought, " Gosh! Something must be going on here that I'm not aware of." Then, I went to my physician and I said, "I've got this tenderness, what might this be?" And he gave me an examination and eventually took some blood and found out I had lower testosterone. That's the first time in my life I thought I'd have lower testosterone. 

00:42:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:42:05
TED CHAPIN I was a wrestler, a cross-country runner, quite an athlete. The last thing I imagined was I'm gonna lose testosterone. And when I had some testosterone replacement therapy, it was amazing! I had more energy, I was more alert, I felt better, uhm, I, I had more sexual responsiveness. And things really changed. And it was all because I had the courage to admit... (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
TED CHAPIN ...it to myself first and then go to my physician and talk about it. 

00:42:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And Ted. (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
TED CHAPIN And of course, sharing it with you afterwards(ph). 

00:42:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well and, and because of our experience, you know, I can't tell you how many clients, male clients have said, "Have you had your testosterone checked?" They'll go have it checked and they'll say, "I can't believe how low it was." I mean, and it was a simple blood test, and so, and I know that's controversial too. There are lots of physicians to say, "No, don't wanna go there." But I guess that's one of the things that I wanna say to us, as consumers, is that we need to be educated enough to say, "This is what I choose to do." Now you may not agree with it, but this is what I'd like to do." And make our own decisions about things. And I think it has made a difference. I went to menopause very early, and I, and I have to say honestly, and I had a 3-year-old at the time. And I thought I can't have a 3-year-old and go through menopause. It's just, you know, it didn't jive. And it was very difficult for me. And uhm, I too went back to the doctor and I said, you know, "What's going on?" And he drew blood and he said, "Yeah. Not only are you going through Lori, you're done." I said, "I'm done!" And I was just shocked and, and because I'm very thin and uhm, because I went to menopause early, I had to make a decision, "Do I wanna go on hormone replacement." The research says, "Don't do it." But I had to go back. I went, and I think this is the thing I wanna say to as far as being a consumer of, of products. I decided, I'm gonna read the research. I went to the research study, found that the average age of the female in the study was in their 70's, and I was 43 at the time, and you know the one that they just said, they just went out last year. And so I went back to my gynecologist with tons, I mean, they must hate to see me coming. Because I had papers and volumes of material and I wanna say, "I've read this. Have you read this?" And he'll sit and read it. And finally, you know, we decided as a team, "I'm gonna go on hormone replacement therapy." And Ted, I, I found the same thing. I found that it helped me, uhm, energy has not really been a problem for me, but what it helped my do, you're laughing, but what it helped me do is it helped with uhm, memory. I love having it. I have more memory now because that's where that loss of estrogen, there's been a little loss of memory. Uhm, and I found it helps with the vaginal lubrication as well. So it's a choice we've made, I'm not saying its a choice for everyone but it certainly has been beneficial, but it wasn't easy. (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
TED CHAPIN No. (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN It wasn't an easy thing to do and talk about, but we have to be educated. So I think that's just, that's just really important, you know. Uhm, yeah.(crosstalk) 

00:44:45
BARB PETERS I think what you're saying is, is has become uhm, educated on it and make your own decision. 

00:44:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And, and Barb, but that's not easy for a lot of people because I think you said, it was so nice, Becky, you know, we say that most of us believe our physicians. And I love our physicians, but the, our guide and powerful, and they are, but they're people. And so we have to make those decisions for ourself and really read up on things. I think another thing that I wanted to point out, as far as suggestions for a vital sex life is that, I don't but, and I'd love you all all to talk about this, but our lives are so busy. We have two kids. Uhm, we're doing baseball four nights a week. I mean, in school or I was doing homework and I'm writing, Ted's writing, we're counseling, and sometimes it's really hard to find time for one another. And so Ted and I started. Well we started this when we got married, we uhm, every Friday we make a date, and we have a date. (crosstalk) 

00:45:35
TED CHAPIN It's a date in the afternoon. 

00:45:35
BARB PETERS Uh-huh. 

00:45:35
Lori Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:45:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And it's been hard sometimes to get to it, but I think it teaches our children, that your dad and mom have to have time alone. So I think one of my suggestions would be that it's really, we have, you have to value the relationship, you have to value the partnership, uhm, go out to dinner, do whatever you need to do. Uhm, and then I guess, I think you have to make time for special times too; making memories. I think we have to do that and, I won't go into detail, but Ted and I just went to it, can I tell the story? 

00:46:00
TED CHAPIN Sure. 

00:46:00
Lori Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:46:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN For our anniversary, I found this wonderful spa and it was gorgeous. And Ted and I, just last weekend went to a spa. And it was, the room was beautiful, but, and one night wasn't enough, and I know, I know money is tough sometimes too. But the first night, we're thinking of how are our kids, how are the grandkids, I mean, how our grandparents doing. By the second day, I'm thinking, " I don't care where my kids are". You know, Ted and I are having a great time. But it, it, we had to have time away to kind of explore and think about different activities that we could do together as a couple. And we had full body massages. Do we look better? 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:46:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:46:35
TED CHAPIN My first pedicure and manicure and... (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And Ted's glowing, isn't he? (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
TED CHAPIN ...a facial. 

00:46:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN There you go. 

00:46:40
TED CHAPIN And you giggled a couple of times. (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN You giggled a lot. 

00:46:40
TED CHAPIN So I just, I just couldn't help it. (crosstalk) 

00:46:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN But we had fun. I don't know if we'll ever do it again, but I think you have to have fun uhm, exploring and, and investigating. I also think that as we get older, uhm, we have to explore new techniques. Ah, sexual techniques that might have been talked about, some might have worked when we are on our 20's or 30's, probably aren't' gonna work when we're in our 50's or 60's. And so there have to be alternate ways of, of showing sexuality. And ah, one of the things that I, uhm, that I have discovered in the research support system, and I think both Johnny and Ted talked about this, that men need more foreplay as they get older. And I think this has been really difficult for a lot of my male clients because they'll say, "You know I used to see a really attractive female" or "I used to have a sexual fantasy and I would have an erection and it would be great". And now they're saying, "I don't have any erections and I don't have any sexual fantasies". And one of the things that I've, I've just taken out some research and I've said to my male clients, "You know, that's okay". And you talked about this Barb that uhm, everything still works okay. So you have to have more foreplay, you might have to masturbate, you might have to help that person. And then everything works fine. But that, you have to get over that. And I think for many men, I think more men than women, that is more difficult. 

00:47:55
TED CHAPIN I think being patient, being sensitive, uhm, being flexible, uh, talking openly, uhm, uh, being uh, not so afraid of, of, of having some faltering is very important... 

00:48:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. 

00:48:10
TED CHAPIN ...because that may happen. And if you share that and talk about it and play with it, it can become a really good experience. 

00:48:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Ah, you know, and I think Ted, you are saying this so nicely, but to me it goes back to, and I see these a lot in therapy that, and I do a lot, I actually do and I am surprised that this teaching of, of sexual techniques, and I am not an expert, I'm kind of learning along with everyone, but I'm teaching a lot of techniques and one of the things I found is that for many couples, men say that sex is intimate, women say "No, it's not sex that's intimate". I want you to snuggle with me. I want you to hold my hand first. I'd like you to kiss me on the cheek first. I don't want you just going for it, you know." And, and that's what I'm finding now with, with uhm, ageing and sexuality is that the man, now the man wants the same thing. And so it, you, you're right Ted, you have to keep talking about it, you have to be patient, and, uhm, and then maybe giggle about it, not, I mean, we giggle a lot because its like, "Well, I guess this is not gonna work now." You know what, "So do we try it another time or." And I just think those are things you have to do and not feel faulty. Okay. We spent a lot of time today talking about ways to enhance uhm, our sex life as we age, and yet, we haven't spent a lot of time talking about differences in physical ways that we can enhance ourself, our sex life. And you know, I think some of these things are actually difficult to talk about, but, for example, I think our perception of sexuality usually tends to deal with just intercourse, and as we age, some of those positions that we always used to do, perhaps may be more difficult to do, for all the reasons we've already discussed. But I think uhm, as a couple, you really have to explore different ways, different positions; physical positions that might be more comfortable. And, but again, you have to make sure that it's gonna be comfortable for both parties. I think there are some other ways that we can become vital in our ageing and sexuality too. It may not include intercourse, but it might include things like oral sex. And again, we talked about this in our panel today, but that it has to be comfortable for both parties, or if you're single, you have to decide it's something I can do, but oral sex would be a really nice way to enhance your, your sexuality. Uhm, it could be masturbation; mutual masturbation. We talked about men and ageing, how oftentimes, as men age, they need more foreplay. Well this would be a way that they could have, you could do mutual masturbation. If you're single, masturbation by yourself might be something. And that we talked about how important it is that you be comfortable. But again, if it's something you would like to explore, I think that has to be, you know, happen. You could perhaps talk to someone in your clergy or as a counselor and help them talk to you about some of those areas that might enhance your sex life, but you're a little uncomfortable talking about. I, you know, I, we talked a little bit and care about how important fantasy might play a role, that if you could have a vital fantasy life, research is suggesting now that sexual fantasies are often a very good way to continue to be vital an, and sexual as we age. Uhm, I think another thing that couples and people who are single might wanna explore is the use of tools that could enhance sexuality; uhm, vibrators, things that, that you would be comfortable using, but that could enhance your sexuality as we continue to age. So there are some physical things, uhm, we've already talked a lot about how important it is to be passionate as far as hugging and kissing, but I think there are physical ways that we can enhance our sex life as, as well, and, and be sure that you include those when we talk about our uhm, interventions, when we talk about our suggestions for sexuality about it. Barb, how about you? Uhm, any suggestions.(crosstalk) 

00:51:45
Barb Peters, MC, LCPC 

00:51:45
BARB PETERS Well I, I've, You've talked a lot about being with a partner. Uhm, and like to talk about not being with a partner. Uhm, the uhm, in the Outrageous Older Women, she had a, a paragraph in there that I just loved, and that, that our sexuality can be exhibited by having intercourse, obviously. But it can also be by reading of sexy novels, seeing a sexy play or, or a movie, but more than that, and this struck me personally, it can be pouring out your love and your affection to your children or your grandchildren. And you talked about the hugs. Uh, I heard somewhere that you need 12 hugs a day... 

00:52:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN At least, I think. (crosstalk) 

00:52:30
BARB PETERS ...just to, just to maintain, you know, sanity and I thought, "Why? Where am I gonna get 12 hugs a day as a single person?" And I'm not talking anything kinky here, but "my cats". Yeah, or your pets. Your dogs. You know, they're, they're loving, they're giving back to you unconditional love and uhm, you know, Mr. Sweetpea(ph) sits in my lap in the morning when I read my paper and do my crossword puzzles and I say, "You're the man of my life." You know, 'coz he, I can pour my love out, and of course, my granddaughter is very loving. So... (crosstalk) 

00:53:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I bet your cat is a good listener too. (crosstalk) 

00:53:00
BARB PETERS  finding other ways to ah, to have somebody love you in return uhm, and you know, maybe it's, maybe it's not a relation; everything is a relationship, everything is a relationship. 

00:53:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN So you're saying, maybe it's not the, it's not the... 

00:53:20
BARB PETERS Not the typical.(crosstalk) 

00:53:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...tradition, traditional. (crosstalk) 

00:53:20
BARB PETERS Exactly on point.(crosstalk) 

00:53:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Absolutely. It think that's so important. 

00:53:20
BARB PETERS  And uhm, so sexuality can be overt or it can be sublimated, and I think I'm talking about sublimated ways of... (crosstalk) 

00:53:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:53:35
BARB PETERS ...of expressing it. And I wanna talk about sexuality transmitted diseases. Ah, even though we're seniors and we're up there, there are still diseases out there. And uhm, then, you should always use a condom. And because of this vaginal dryness that women may be suffering from, a latex lubricated condom might be the answer. It might be a healthy solution there. (crosstalk) 

00:54:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Would be helpful. 

00:54:00
BARB PETERS So always using a condom, and if it's, if you're starting with somebody new, inquire, "what's your history?" I would demand a test. I, you know, because we've got vaginal warts, we've got AIDS, we've got herpes, (crosstalk) 

00:54:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:54:15
BARB PETERS we've got things that once you get them, you got them. 

00:54:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. 

00:54:20
BARB PETERS And uhm, to say nothing uhm, this Sue(ph), this R.N. on TV, it says, "Yeast infections is a big call." 

00:54:25
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:54:25
BARB PETERS Ah, and you know, and so asking for their history and if they won't give it to you, then you could make your own decisions about that. (crosstalk) 

00:54:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN The plague, right? (crosstalk) 

00:54:35
BARB PETERS But, but you assume the worst and go from there. 

00:54:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN But Becky that I think essentially, you were talking though when you're listening to, earlier to Barb about latex, and you mentioned something was fascinating, I thought. 

00:54:50
BECKY SCHROEDER I have a latex allergy. 

00:54:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:54:50
BARB PETERS Oh. 

00:54:50
Becky Schroeder, RN. BS 

00:54:50
BECKY SCHROEDER So the latex condoms wouldn't work. Uhm, and again, lesbian population is no different, you know. So that's one of the things that you take into consideration. If you have a latex allergy, then you find alternative means. 

00:55:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. 

00:55:05
BECKY SCHROEDER So. (crosstalk) 

00:55:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN But, and once again, we have to be aware that that's a possibility. (crosstalk) 

00:55:10
BECKY SCHROEDER Exactly, exactly. 

00:55:10
BARB PETERS And you were talking earlier, I, I was ruling out the possibility for pregnancy, but depending on when we wanna start saying elderly or senior, that yes, you still do have to watch out for the possibility of pregnancy. 

00:55:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And then yet, the fluke side of that, Barb, is though, actually, you know, a role is really difficult when I went to menopause, I remember thinking and I struggled having children anyway, but I remembered, when I finally went to menopause, I think, you know I'm not gonna have children anymore. And there was, there was a small-like, (crosstalk) 

00:55:40
UNKNOWN Oh, what's a feeling. (crosstalk) 

00:55:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN "Oh! What a let down that was." But then it was like, "Holy smokes! I'm not gonna have children anymore!" And you know, cause for like 30 years, you worry about them. And then suddenly it's like I don't have to worry about that. And so there is some lightness to that too. I mean, I understand your fear but there is still some lightness to that, too. (crosstalk) 

00:55:55
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:55:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And that made it just more fun too. So I think we have to recognize that's a relief as well. 

00:56:00
BARB PETERS Uh-huh. Absolutely. 

00:56:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Ted how about you, any other, you know, suggestions for a vital sex life? 

00:56:05
Ted Chaplin, Ph.D. 

00:56:05
TED CHAPIN Well, I think to emphasize some other things that Barb just said, you know, maintain your other relationships, your none sexual relationships and develop your friends and uhm, be close with your family, and be active in your community, and make sure you have a good solid support network around you, and, and talk and communicate and share, and all of those things are important, because they will give you the skills that should apt to become by for sexually active relationship, and be better prepared to receive that and to enjoy that. So don't just think in terms of sex. Thinks, think in terms of relating and communicating and being in contact with many different people around you. I guess the last thing I would say is, and we've said this many times today, but it's so important just to relax, uhm, to be flexible, to be open and to learn, and to enjoy the experience that you're having. Uhm, uhm, probably cross the board, that would be good advice. 

00:56:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN  You know, we spent so much time this morning. We've tried to talk a lot so many different things, but I think maybe we should end the tape with DVD or our discussion today, just talking about some general conclusions that each of us might have. It could be something that come of the top of our head or research that we have had,- 

00:57:15
Conclusions Sexual activity may decline with age but interest and ability stay fairly constant. If you maintain a constant level of sexual activity biological changes will be less pronounced. Sex is normal & natural and can be pleasurable across the life span. Sex is much more than intercourse. A healthy sex life adds to your general health. Educate yourself and others about maintaining a vital sex life. 

00:57:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN - but uhm, Barb I wanna start with you. After you've listened to all this, what are your conclusions? 

00:57:15
BARB PETERS  Well, that sexual activity may decline with age but the interest is, stays pretty constant. I think most people are still interested in having an active sex life. 

00:57:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And how important it is that we keep talking about it, or if not, keep talking about it, start talking about it. 

00:57:35
BARB PETERS Right. Absolutely. 

00:57:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay. Ted, how about for you, major conclusion? 

00:57:40
TED CHAPIN Well, sex is normal. It's a normal part of the whole life span. And even when there is physical decline or some emotional issues, there doesn't have to be a roadblock in the way. You can get lots of help, lots of information, medical assistance from your doctor, and you can regain that uh, pleasurable sex life. 

00:57:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN So it should be something that we can engage in for a long time? 

00:58:00
TED CHAPIN Yes. 

00:58:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN There you go. All right. 

00:58:00
TED CHAPIN Hey. 

00:58:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hey. (laughs) Johnny, how about for you? 

00:58:05
Johnny Compton, MA 

00:58:05
JOHNNY COMPTON Uhm, I agree with what's been said, that uh, sex is uh, something that's good, shouldn't be a taboo, 'coz you're elderly, and ah, we should uhm, embrace it and try to enjoy it and communicate, uhm, and sex is like you say is, with men, we get older, we, we want the, the foreplay now. So, and that's something that a lot of men, we know it, but we won't talk about it, and we need to talk about that, let our partners know that. And I'd like to add, also add that uhm, for us, the seniors uhm, who wanted to marry and marry, we need to do something to our beloved(ph) and let them know that uhm, instead of being an obstacle, they need to try to enhance that two things, love each other. (crosstalk) 

00:58:45
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:58:45
JOHNNY COMPTON They're gettin married. They lost two incomes and now they got one income. 

00:58:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:58:45
JOHNNY COMPTON So it's, it's a lot of agony there. 

00:58:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. But I hear you saying, Johnny, that it's important that not only we talk but we, all of us should begin to advocate? For. (crosstalk) 

00:58:55
JOHNNY COMPTON Right, advocate a change in their life. 

00:58:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. For the elderly and for our, our overall life development. (crosstalk) 

00:59:00
BARB PETERS 'Coz we're gonna be there. (crosstalk) 

00:59:00
JOHNNY COMPTON Right. (crosstalk) 

00:59:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. Yeah, really. 

00:59:00
JOHNNY COMPTON Uh-huh. 

00:59:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Becky, how about for you, conclusions? 

00:59:05
Becky Schroeder, RN, BS 

00:59:05
BECKY SCHROEDER Uhm, I agree with everything that's been said. The one thing I would add too is, is I believe it should be absolutely spontaneous, a lot of the time. You know, for me it's, it's as much as picking up the phone and saying, "Have I told you how much I love you today?" 

00:59:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. 

00:59:20
BECKY SCHROEDER Or uh, "You, you make my day." Or "I look forward to seeing you when I get home from work." On the other hand, I, I think it's extremely important that we start educating our health care providers. 

00:59:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. 

00:59:30
BECKY SCHROEDER  Uhm, I think it's very important that we start educating our kids. You know, kids learn a lot from the streets and they don't learn the positive things. You know, and I think, uhm, at, at, even before the age of sexuality, there are, uh, or puberty, if you wanna say it that way. There are things that we can do to educate our kids. (crosstalk) 

00:59:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:59:55
BECKY SCHROEDER You know, how we respond to each other in a relationship, uhm, showing them the important parts that it's, and then when they get older and reach that puberty, it's not just sex; it's the intimacy, it's the holding hands like we've discussed. (crosstalk) 

01:00:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

01:00:05
BECKY SCHROEDER So I think that's all very important also. 

01:00:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Uh-huh. I guess my final conclusion would be, probably how much I learned. I mean, and next I've, I've taken classes on these, but just talking to each of you, I, I learned something new. Uhm, and that being older, as my mom would say, and sexuality is so healthy and so normal. And I think I'm gonna continue to grow and, and continue to have a vital sex life. But, I mean, I just feel like I'm just a little neophyte and I'm getting much older, so I think it's exciting and, and I guess I would just say in, in, to each of you, thank you so much. Uhm, I think each of us have brought our own twistedest idea of sex and ageing and I just wanna thank you very much. I'd like to thank uhm, WTV the staff and uhm,- 

01:00:50
Thank you WTV Staff Barb Peters MC. LCPC. GERONTOLOGY CERTIFIED Johnny Compton MA Becky Schroeder RN, BN 

01:00:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN - for helping us put this discussion together. But again, thank all of you for your time and your energy and your courage, because honestly, I giggled a lot thinking, "I can't believe I'm gonna do this." And uhm, your courage and willingness to, to bring this topic to the forefront. So thank you very much and uhm, I appreciate your help. Thanks again. 

01:01:15
JOHNNY COMPTON Thank you.
