PATRICIA ARREDONDO  First new about, as I finished my graduate training and started to teach back in 1979, 1980. I think this was at, when I was at Boston University when I first learned about the book, " Counseling American Minorities," ah, Atkinson, Morten, and Sue, which is now on its sixth edition. And as a young professor ah, and I think it, that happens to still, it still happens to me today when I meet, meet people, as you know, you fu, you're in awe of, of people who, who are publishing and, and, especially if they're saying things that really resonate for you. And Counseling American Minorities was that kind of book that got my attention because I was reading these chapters that were uhm, talking about the importance of culture in counseling. And I certainly ah, believe in that and this, having done here today is looking back to about 20 some years, and saying, I've the opportunity to have you here at our RACE conference and it's a real privilege to have you here at our RACE conference. Don is probably one of the ah, most prolific contributors to the literature in the area of counseling psychology, looking at ethnic racial variables. Don received his doctorate from the University of Wisconsin Madison and joined the Counseling Psychology Program at the University of California Santa Barbara, where he had been associated and was associated with the ins, institutions throughout his career. He is currently Professor Emeritus in the combined program in the Gevirtz' Graduate School of Education at UCSB. I mentioned before, he is the author of Counseling American Minorities, co-author, and now in its sixth edition. He's also co-author of Counseling Diverse Populations, now on its third edition, and Counseling Across the Lifespan. As I mentioned, Don is very prolific. He's the author or co-author of more than 100 journal article, 130 journal articles and book chapters, most of which report of results of research under role of ethnic and cultural variables in the counseling process. He was elected to fellowship status in both Division 17 and 45 of the American Psychological Association. And, in ah, year 2001, he received the Lifetime Research Award from Division 45, which is the soci, society for the psychological study of ethnic minority issues. And I was president at that time, so I was really excited to be there when you got that award in San Francisco. Uhm, Dr. Atkinson has been just a phenomenal contributor to psychology and to expanding our knowledge of these ethnic and racial variables as we try to get a little bit greater understanding of instrumentation ah, methodology research, and so forth. That's, that's taking place in the name of ethnic racial minority research. So with those few words that are very understated, I'd like to welcome Dr. Donald Atkinson for his keynote address.

PATRICIA ARREDONDO (laughs) Do(ph) we have a statement to address what (inaudible ). 

00:03:47
DONALD ATKINSON I've been lost without that. Uhm, thank you Patricia for those ah, very inflated words of my (laughs) career. I can only echo uhm, James Anderson's ah, comments this morning, "If you stick around long enough, you can have a beetle look like that." Uhm, I'm really happy to be here uhm, uhm, this is a great conference, isn't it? I mean, it's just an incredible conference. And, I was particularly happy to be here yesterday and hear ah, Gene Garcia's introductory remarks. Ah, what an inspiring speaker. Gene and I go back a long ways ah, in the 1970s. Uhm, Gene was an associate professor at UCSB and he chaired the affirmative action committee there and I was a member of that committee. So we knew each other back in the 1970s. And I can tell you that then, as now uhm, he was a powerful advocate for people of color and women and uhm, other diversity. I ah, came away from ah, Gene's ah, talk with ah, ah, well, a number of thoughts, but two stick in my mind and I'll share those with you. One was that, uhm, I think ASU, the ASU ah, School of Education is ah, incredibly lucky to have someone like him as dean ah, to have Elsie Moore as a Divisional Director ah, to have the, the faculty that you have here. Ah, those of you who, who are students ah, in this ah, dep, in this school of education, I doubt if you realize how lucky you are to have the resources that you have. Ah, it's ah, really nice that you invite us outside experts in, but you have some real experts here that uhm, I certainly look up to. Uhm, I'm very flattered to be here, but although I'm flattered to be here, I, I feel like I need to ah, start off with a, a disclaimer because I'm really not an expert, on ah, psychological measurement and evaluation. Uhm, in fact, my only training in, in ah, measurement really took place back in the late 1960s when I was probably paying attention to other things. That was during the ah, Vietnam War Era, and I was taking part in peace marches, skipping classes, (laughs) and uhm, so I probably didn't listen as care, listen as carefully as I should have to some of those classes. And, and that, and that's not really ah, my area. Uhm, I've done research for the last 30 years on counseling process and outcome as Patricia indicated uhm, but I have more than a passing interest in the measurement of acculturation. Uhm, I sort of stumbled into this whole multicultural area at a very opportune time. I, I, went to UCSB in 1972 ah, and the program already had started recruiting underrepresented minorities. And those underrepresented minorities put pressure on me and other faculty to uhm, address issues of uhm, multiculturalism and particularly to include ethnic minorities in our samp, sample populations. Uhm, in 1976, I published my first study of, which was uhm, a study of Asia, I'm so, not my first study, my first multicultural study. Ah, it was a study ah, that examined uhm, Asian-American preferences for counselor ethnicity and counseling style and uhm, that study received a lot attention. I should say, by the way, that that study took place because of two Japanese-American students, Merv Maruyama, and Sani Matsui, who, again, put pressure on me to, let's do a, some research with ah, Japanese-Americans. Uhm, that study received a great deal of attention. Uhm, I actually got probably several hundred reprints, requests. Now, re, reps, request, those of you who are older academics will remember what those are. They've kinda gone the way of the 8-track tape, and typewriters and ah, you know, other slide rules. But ah, in those days, you got request for reprints. And uhm, so I, I had about 200 hundred request for that particular study. So the combination and the notoriety that I got from that study ah, plus a changing demographics in California ah, plus the pressure from ethnic minority students, kinda pushed me into this multicultural area. The design of that first study was embarrassingly simple uhm, because the handful of earlier studies involving ethnic minorities, often with Blacks, had been comparative on some kind of, of dependent variable like ah, some measure of achievement or something. And, and so we had these comparative studies that invariably showed that the ethnic minority ah, population, particularly Blacks, was doing ah, worse than, than the uhm, White population. So as a result, we decided uhm, not to ah, include any uhm, European-Americans in our study. We just had Japanese- Americans. Ah, so that was part of the kinda simplistic design. And, and the result of that was that later, we couldn't ah, claim that the, the results that we found, Japanese-American preference for directive counseling uhm, was unique to them, that it cou, ah, might not also be true from, for European Americans. Uhm, the, the findings did reinforce though, what some ah, Asian-American ah, psychologist had been saying, and that was that Asian-Americans preferred directive counseling styles. Ah, unfortunately, this, I probably contributed to a stereotype that all Asian-Americans prefer directive counseling style. Also, the study had nothing to do with what they might benefit from. It was about preferences for counseling style. Uhm, and in addition to only including Asian-Americans, we failed to take any kinda within group differences into account when we did this study among our Asian-American participants. So, uhm, most importantly, we failed to take into account acculturation because later we found that ah, while this preference for directive counseling style was quite, uhm, strong among low acculturated Asian-Americans, for higher acculturated Asian-Americans with differences and preferences tended to wash out. So uhm, Daniel, we can now hit that first slide. So ah, today uhm, I'd like to talk about what I've learned about acculturation as I've attempted to measure it ah, as a predictor or independent variable in my studies ah, where I was looking at counseling process and outcome. First of all, we'll define what we mean by "acculturation," and then I'll provide a rationale for measuring acculturation ah, why it's important to both counseling psychologist and educators. Uhm, I'll then review how we currently measure acculturation. Ah, next, I'll cover some of the problems with the way we currently measure acculturation. And finally, I'll offer a couple of suggestions for improving the way we uhm, I think, improving the way we measure acculturation. Now, keep in mind, I'm a counseling process and outcome researcher. Uhm, I'm not an expert on ah, measurement, but this is, unfortunately most of the re, ah, the uhm, the, one of the limitations that I'll be talking about, one is that, uhm, a lot of these measures of acculturation have been made by people like me, who are really into counseling process and outcome, not into measurement and evaluation. Ah, I should also take a moment to uhm, thank Daniel who is doing ah, being my A, AV man here. Uhm, okay. What is acculturation? Before we get into a discussion of how to measure acculturation, it's important that we have a common definition of the term. I, I've also kind of feel like I need to almost apologize that I'm, I'm going to go through a very kind of ah, as you saw a very kinda simplistic way of approaching this, but I almost feel like we need to step back from where we are now and kind of start over, with this whole idea of measuring acculturation. Uhm, it's one of those terms too that we, there are multiple definitions of as, as we'll see in a moment. Ah, but, but the very sound of the word suggests that it has something to do with the acquisition of culture. So before we define acculturation ah, we'll talk about culture. Ah, Craiger, Kroeber and Kluckhohn ah, were two of the uhm, 20th century anthropologist who defined culture originally. So uhm, here is their definition uhm, "Culture consists of patterns explicit or, and implicit of and for behavior acquired and transmitted by symbols ah, constituting the distinctive achievement of human groups, including their embodiments and artifacts. The essential core of culture consist of traditional ideas and especially their attached values. Culture systems may on the one hand be considered as products of action and ah, ah, on the other as conditioning elements of further action." So, let me draw your attention to the words that I have italicized ah, words that I believe express the essence of culture. Culture consists of patterns of behavior, the essential core of culture consist of traditional ideas and especially their attached values. Uhm, stated even more so simply, culture consists of behavior and values. And I was interested earlier when uhm, Dr. Anderson talk about uhm, African-American values that we haven't really ah, focused on it. We talked, we certainly talked about Asian-American values ah, Mexican-American, Hispanic values so on. Uhm, but he talked about some important values and I think you'll see how this ties in later, the whole idea that values in ethnic culture are very important but in the acculturation process, we're overlooking them. Uhm, anthropologists became interested in the concept of acculturation back in the 1920s and 1930s. Ah, in 1936, ah, Redfield, Lin, Linton and Herskovits defined it as follows, "Acculturation comprehends those phenomena, which result when groups of individuals having different cultures come into continuous first hand contact with subsequent changes in the original culture pattern, patterns of either or both groups." Okay. Then later in the mid 1950s, a social sciences research counselor came up with the following, and I'm not gonna read that whole thing but I'll again draw your attention to the italicized, what, which I have italicized. " Acculturation may be defined as cultural change that is initiated by the conjunction of two or more autonomous cultural systems. Its dynamics can be seen as a selective adaptation of va, of value systems." Now, both definitions tells us that acculturation refers to cultural change that takes place when two or more cultures ah, come into contact. From our definition of culture ah, we know this means changes in behavior and values. Ah, the second definition draws a particular attention to values. Well, we have not been measuring values in ah, acculturation. And again, what Dr. Anderson was talking about was values uhm, the important values in African-American society that do support education, but uhm, in any event, in cul, in acculturation, we haven't been measuring values. Uhm, also note that neither definition has, says anything about direction of change. Uhm, we got into this whole thing of direction of change uhm, when ah, many, many uhm, psychologists in the 1960's pointed out what acculturation in this country and correctly so had pointed that it means adopting the, the ah, values and behaviors of the dominant society. But that's not the way culture and accul, acculturation was originally defined. It was just the changes that took place, possibly in both cultures. But because of this, we have kind of shaped our own view of what acculturation is. Uhm, psychologist, I'm sorry, I, my voice is, I've been trying to nurse it the last couple of days ah, but it may give out on me from time to time. I think we can make it through this, so uhm, psychologists became interested in acculturation in the 1960s and 70s, and Graves ah, coined the term, " psychological acculturation" or "individual acculturation" to distinguish it from ah, the, what anthropologists were talking about. Uhm, I'm gonna take this thing off so it don't keep bothering me. Uhm, so, if we accept that culture is, consist of behaviors and values uhm, it ah, psychological acculturation involves the behavior and value changes that individuals are making because anthropologist tend to talk about uhm, changes in social structure, economic base, political organization, things like that. Uhm, in our case, we're talking about individual uhm, values and, and ah, behavior. And I'm, I've been talking as if we're all psychologists. I know that where educators here. But I think for educators, it's the very same thing, and we're talking about individual ah, changes in individual values and behaviors. Several models of psychological ah, or individual acculturation have been developed. One of the earliest and most enduring models was developed by Jose Szapocznik and his colleagues. Okay, so there you go. First proposition says, "Individual acculturation is a linear process that progresses as a function of the length of time the person has been exposed to the culture." So the more time that you've been here, the more you've adopted the dominant culture ah, values and behavior. Uhm, that's the linear, this whole idea of a linear process, going from the ah, indigenous culture to the ah, host culture. The rate of acculturation is a function of the individual's age, specifically the younger a person uhm, is at the time of his or her exposure to the host culture, the more rapid the acculturation process will be. Now, I'm, I'm, what I'm giving you are the propositions that, that they laid out, which where of, a major step forward at that time, but created some problems for them. One, as I pointed out, is this idea of a linear change. Uhm, three, the ah, rate of acculturation differs for males and females, with males acculturating more rapidly than females. Well, that's not true for all cultures. They where mainly studying ah, Mexican-American culture, Hispanic culture. And it is often a function of who gets the jobs first. And in that case, it was the men getting the jobs, although that's changing. But in other cultures where it's the women getting the jobs, they're the ones who acculturate more rapidly. But at that time, this is what uhm, was proposed. And then there are at least two distinct dimensions of acculturation: a dimension of behavioral acculturation and a dimension of value acculturation. And uhm, real, the, the behavior, devo- uhm, dimension involves things like language, customs, habits ah, preferred activities and lifestyle. The value dimensions involve things like norms, attitudes, and beliefs. Uhm, so, again, they reinforce this whole idea of uhm, of values and behavior making up uhm, culture and acculturation. Okay, another psychologist who had done ah, has done a lot of research on acculturation is John Berry. According to Berry, psychological acculturation involves two types of culture change: culture shedding and culture learning. Okay? Uhm, culture shedding involves voluntary or accidental loss of culture behaviors and values. Actually, uhm, in terms of culture shedding, I, I prefer to talk about culture retention or culture relinquishment. Shedding, I, I've this idea of a snake skedding, shedding his skin or tree shedding their leaves. It's kind of a negative connotation, and so, I think talking about culture retention or relinquishment, because people often do relinquish their culture, but shedding is just too negative. Ah, culture learning involves voluntary and, or in ah, accidental acquisition of cultural behaviors and values. So, remember these two concepts ah, the idea of culture ah, retention and culture acquisition ah, because when I could pull, come back to those. A few minute, minutes ago, I said that the original definitions of acculturation said nothing about the direction of cultural change. But by common usage uhm, psychologists have kinda changed that so that we now think of acculturation as moving from the indigenous culture to the, to the host culture. But again, that's not the way it was originally defined. Uhm, let's go ahead with that inculturation. So, co-, common usage then of acculturation uhm, is a, is, is a, has changed ah, for what happens is individual's values and behaviors, when they come in contact to another culture to adopting those of the host culture. As far as I know, Herskovits was the first anthropologist to use the term inculturation ah, back in 1948. Now, inculturation refers to the learning of values and behaviors in the indigenous culture. We've kinda lost sight of inculturation in this whole process. We're focusing on acculturation but from this narrow perspective. Uhm, so, I think we need to think more about uhm, inculturation. I should pause here to point out that I'm using the terms indigenous and host culture ah, but the same concepts apply to minority and majority cultures. Uhm, minority culture is probably more accurate to use when you're talking about American Indians who obviously were the host culture when European-Americans came here with ah, superior force and power and so forth. All is, similarly, minority culture is probably more appropriate when we're talking about African-Americans who have been here as long as European-Americans on the Western Hemisphere. Uhm, and so uhm, these concepts of inculturation and acculturation, then cultural acquisition and re ah, relinq-, relinquishment or retention apply to minority and majority cultures as well. Ah, John Berry and his colleagues also came up with ah, four acculturation strategies that immigrants can take when exposed to a host culture.

00:24:15
DONALD ATKINSON (Coughs) People who adopt a marginalization strategy don't really embrace and manifest the behavior of, or, and values of either culture, okay? So ah, those who adopt the separation strategy adopt the ah, ah, behaviors, and values, values, maintain of ah, behaviors and values of their indigenous culture but reject those of the host culture. And in the uhm, assimilation strategy, it's just the opposite. They relinquish the values and behaviors of their indigenous color, culture, and adopt those of the ah, host culture. And in the integration strategy, they maintain their uhm, values and behaviors from the indigenous culture while adopting those of the host culture uhm, which is biculturalism. We've been talking about ah, biculturalism for some time. So that's the strategy of the bicultural person. Okay, so why should we measure acculturation? We now know that, that there's a gerin-, generic definition of acculturation. The anthropologist gave us the psychologist definition which is a linear process, and uhm, that psychological ah, acculturation refers to changes and attitudes, and behaviors. So, what? Why is this so important uhm, to educators and psychologists? Uhm, the main reason is that acculturation is not always a smooth process uhm, for the, uh, especially, for individuals. When the changes in an individual has to go through during acculturation, like adjusting to a new language ah, different customs, unfamiliar rules ah, and lifestyle exceed the capacity of the person to deal with them, it results in acculturative stress. Psychologists like to talk about stress and distress. Uhm, poverty and racism experienced by immigrants and minority people further exacerbates this acculturative stress. Ah, furthermore, it's been hypothesized that all this acculturative stress leads to physical and mental health problems, physical and, I'm sorry, mental and physical, because we tend to overlook that there, that acculturation affects the physical side of individuals. And, in fact, three different relationships were hypothesized ah, between acculturation and psychological distress. Ah, one is a negative relationship. As immigrants become more acculturally, acculturated, their psychological stress goes down ah, psychological distress goes down. According to this viewpoint, immigrants experience their heaviest stress when they first get here and then as they learn the language and learn the customs and the rules of the society, then their distress ah, goes down. Another hypothesized relationship is there's a positive relationship between acculturation and distress. Ah, as immigrants become more acculturated, their psychological distress goes up. And this uhm, there, the uhm, thinking here is that as they become more and more aware of racism and ah, discrimination, as that becomes more apparent and they're affected by it, their distress goes up. So, that sounds equally good too. Uhm, ah, then, a curvil-, curvilinear relationship was hypothesized. Psychological distress increases at both ends of the acculturated extremes and the optimum balance is in the middle, where people are bicultural, and there they experience the least distress and that's kinda was the whole bicultural movement. Uhm, there's a sense uhm, Berry's acculturation strategies for published people came up with a fourth possibility, and that is that the extremes of a continuum are really the uhm, biculturalism and then the, that is the integration, s, strategy versus the marginal strategy. And that if people who are, adopt the marginalization strategy and reject both cultures who have the major psychological problems. I can remember research on gangs, saying that ah, L.A. gang members uhm, the reason they, I, can be recruited so easily is that in the gangs is that they ah, reject both the uhm, their indigenous culture that they came here with and the host culture. So, they're kinda cultureless and gangs pull them in. (coughs) There, there was an explosion of, of studies in the late 1980s that looked at the relationship between acculturation and the prevalence of ah, mental health problems among immigrants. And uhm, most of this research involved Hispanics, most of it Mexican-Americans. Uhm, reviews to this research began appearing in the late 1990s, I'm sorry, early 1990s, and it, there was one meta-analysis that I know about. And, in general, these reviews concluded that, uhm, ah, some of them came up with evidence of the positive relationship, comes up, came up with negative relationship between acculturation and distress and some found the curvilinear relationship leading to the conclusion that no conclusion could be drawn, are, are easy out in those kinds of situation. Uhm, now, there are number of reasons why those studies resulted in conflicting ah, results. And here are some of those reasons: Uhm, pronounced variation the way acculturation was assessed. Some of the studies used generation since immigration. Some used uhm, years since immigration as a measure. Some use paper-and-pencil measures, and, as you'll see, I think many of those are problematic, especially the ones that were used in these early studies ah, pronounced variation in the way mental health was assessed. Uhm, most of the studies used conventional psychological assessment measures for ah, to measure mental illness and they overlooked the link between mental illness and culture. So, as a co-, consequence, they were making a lot of false positives and false negatives and ah, in their uhm, assessment of mental health problems that uhm, these ah, immigrant groups had. The third uhm, problem, major problem is sample size were often very small. And fourth was that the sample size is provided for a small range of acculturation. They usually just wanna use first generation uhm, people. And then the fifth one, related to point four, was that the studies only used participants who spoke English. Well, I mean very limited range again of acculturation. Also, these studies reported their results in a very, variety of statistical forms, like some use correlation, some used T-Test, some used ah, Chi-Squares, analysis of variance, making it difficult to convert them to a, a common ah, denominator such as standard deviations that could be used to compare effect sizes. Uhm, however, a more recent major study, and this is what I'm really getting to here, is one done by William Vega and Associates, and it found evidence of a positive relationship uhm, between acculturation and mental illness, that is, the longer Mexican-Americans live in the United States, the higher their lifetime prevalence of mental illness. In 1998, Vega et al. ah, conducted a study. It was called a Mexican-American Prevalence and Services Survey, or MAPSS for short. In this study, they surveyed a random sa, uhm, stratified random sample of over 3,000 ah, non-institutionalized adults of Mexican-American background in Fresno uhm, in the Fresno, California area, and they used a composite international diagnostic interview or CIDI to make DSM3R diagnoses for ah, participants who ah, met the diagnostic criteria. DSMR. DSM3R, for those of you who are not familiar with the DSM, is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the Psy- ah, Psychiatric Associate, American Psychiatric Association. For better or for worse, and a lot of us think it's for worse, it's the authoritative book on making clinical diagnoses of, of mental health problems. Ah, why don't we go ahead with the transparency, Daniel. Uhm, now, Daniel, (laughs) I'm sorry, Daniel, sorry. I was gonna credit you with the study, Daniel. Uhm, Vega et al., compared U.S.-born Mexican-Americans with short-term immigrants, those who had lived less than 13 years in the U.S., and long-term immigrants. So, I, I think I have to leave the mic here but, can I do this? Ah, it's not gonna, it's not gonna, all right, the first column there are immigrants that have been here less than 13 years. Obviously the second column, immigrants greater than 13 years; and then U.S.-born Mexican-Americans, okay? So three levels of people of Mexican heritage. And then uhm, there's another study that's done in Mexico City. And then, this NCS study was a national sample of the general population. Now, what I wanna point out to you here is if you look at most of those uhm, psychological disorders on the left-hand column there ah, like major depression, you can go right across it and see how the longer they've been here, the more they're like the general population. So, let's take major depression, 3.2 percent ah, of those who are less than 13 years, 7.9 percent for those over 13 years; and U.S.-born, 14.4 percent in their lifetime will have a diagnosis of, of depression, major depression. Now, that's roughly equivalent to the 17.2 percent over here uhm, in the national sample. Look at Mexico City. They have ah, a lifetime average of ah, psychological depression of 7.8 percent, and that's like the non-U.S. born, the people that are born in Mexico, they're more comparable to Mexico City than they are to uhm, to the general population in the U.S. And if you go down and look at the others, you'll find other major disorders where you find that same pattern of increasing depression the longer they're associated with this culture, and uhm, when they first get here, they're more comparable to the prevalence in Mexico. Now, why might that be? This study doesn't talk about why, really, but why might that be? Well, some people have proposed that in the traditional Mexican culture uhm, there is a lot of family support that kind of mediates and, and prevents ah, psychological disorders. And as the family is here in the U.S. longer, they, some of that is lost, okay? But ah, in the indigenous culture, that family support system probably helps to ah, prevent psychological distress. So, I found this to be, this is really to me very startling evidence that acculturation is positively associated with mental problems, that ah, mental disorders. Uhm, it's been ah, hypothesized that acculturation is related to physical ah, health problems. A recent review of research by Myers and Rodriguez in 2003 linking acculturation to ah, health pro, ah, physical health problems, concluded that ethnic minorities, especially African-Americans, American Indians, Native Hawaiians and Southeast Asian-Americans have a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality, probably not a surprise to anybody here. This is substantial ah, ah, the second point is there is substantial within-group differences in vulnerability to specific diseases and their sequelae and that factor, such as lower SES, obstacles to assessing healthcare and health behaviors contribute to the maintenance of these differences. And this is what I really wanna get to. In addition, there is growing evidence that acculturation to the United States is associated with negative changes in health status and that this apparent increase in ah, disease risk is mediated through changes in lifestyle. Now that seems counterintuitive, doesn't it? I mean, we, we hear about this great healthcare syf-, system that we have in our society and that people are actually living longer than ever before so it seems kinda counterintuitive. But when you think about the stress on people and the couch-potato lifestyle that we've adopted, you can begin to see why as people become acculturated to the U.S. culture, it's detrimental to their physical as well as mental health. Finally it's important for psychologists to measure acculturation because it's been found to be related to counseling process and outcome. And I'm sure the same is true for educational process and outcome. I'm just not familiar with that literature. But in counseling ah, literature, we know that it's related to things like preference for counselor ethnicity ah, attitudes toward seeking psy- ah, professional psychological help ah, willingness to see a counselor, and, and, and other measures. Uhm, okay, how do we measure acculturation? So now that we know why it's important to measure acculturation, let's look at how we measure it. Uhm, remember Szapocznik's first proposition, "Individual acculturation is a linear process that progresses as a function of the length of time the person has been exposed to the culture." Well, a quick, rough measure of acculturation is to ah, simply ask how long the person has been exposed to the, this host culture, years they've been here or generations since acculturation. But, of course, psychologists don't like to use easy measures, so we ah, quick, easy measures, so we've come up with our ah, test of acculturation, me, measures of acculturation. We don't wanna call 'em tests. Uhm, however, psychologists uhm, I'm sorry ah, Bryan, Bryan Kim ah, and Jose Abreu found 33 instruments in their recent review ah, of acculturation instruments. That was done in 2001. They found 33 measures of acculturation. Of these, 23 were measures of Hispanic acculturation, three were measures of Asian-American acculturation, three were measures of Native American acculturation, two were measures of African-American acculturation, and one was a measure of Native Hawaiian acculturation. Ah, and there was also one multi-ethnic acculturation measure. Now, Kim and Abreu ah, categorized instruments as monocultural or, bicul, bicultural based on whether they measured ah, acculturation of one culture or two. They also categorized instruments based on how long ah, I'm so, I'm sorry, based on how many continuua were used to measure acculturation, one continuum or two or more. Thus, a monocultural, unilinear instrument would measure acculturation to one culture along one continuum uhm, like that. Now, notice that that again reflects that bias of acculturation being a process of going from the old ah, shedded culture to this new culture. To score high on this scale, you have to ah, be acculturated to the host culture. Uhm, here is the ah, Dual-cultural, Unilinear slot, as ah, scale, and one end reflects high involvement in the indigenous culture and the other end, high involvement, I'm sorry, uhm, yeah, high involvement in the host culture. So here we have two cultures involved, but it's still along a scale of one to seven going up to the host culture, still implies a direction, an appropriate direction they'd be going in. Uhm, i, instruments utilizing two separate continua ah, to measure acculturation uhm, are, are classified as bilinear ah, in that they use, uhm, one culture to measure adherence to a culture of origin and one to measure adherence to a culture ah, ah, the host culture. Okay, this is the bilinear instrument here. So now we're getting more sophisticated and this, I'm endorsing, okay? We're, this is something that I think has been a, a good movement and uhm, I'll talk about that a little bit more in a, in a minute. Kim and Abreu also analyzed individual items on the 33 instruments to identify the dimensions of acculturation ah, measured by each, and they've found four dimensions were being measured, most commonly behaviors, then values ah, knowledge uhm, that is having an understanding of culture-specific information such as historical significance of a cultural festivity, festivity. And the fourth thing was cultural ethnic identity, how one identifies uhm, ethnically uhm, your comfort towards one's own and the dominant culture. I'd like to show you next two commonly used ah, dual-cultural, unilinear measures of acculturation: uhm, the ARSMA, used to measure Mexican-American acculturation. This was developed back in 1980 and I'll also be talking, just showing very briefly, the SL-ASIA used to measure Asian-American acculturation. This is the original ARSMA, and it uhm, notice uhm, what, it's, what language do you speak? That's a behavior. What language do you prefer? That's a behavior. How do you identify yourself? That has to do with identity development. Ah, what ethnic identification does your mother use? So, that's the kind of uhm, items that there are, there were on that instrument, the ARSMA. Now, they actually had a scale of one to five. But again, it implies that, that directional kind of thing. Okay, and then just quickly ah, here is the SL-ASIA. Ah, what language do you speak? What language do you prefer? How do you identify? What are the, what is, identification of your mother? This is looking vaguely familiar. Well, that's because the SL-ASIA was the ARSMA just written for Asian Americans. So here we have the most commonly used measure of Asian-American acculturation was taken from the first really good instrument that was made for measuring acculturation of Mexican-Americans. We now have uhm, the uhm, a step ahead to the uhm, the ARSMA-II which is a bilinear instrument. And you can see here that they have uhm, first of all, they have in uhm, it's in Spanish now. I should say that the ARSMA-I was ah, written in, Engli-, English and Spanish too. So that was ah, a positive thing. But, uhm, here you can see again it's mainly measuring ah, behaviors that they uhm, and uhm, you know, I actually didn't include the sla, ah, the transparency that shows ah, oh, oh, I'm sorry. Okay. So, this is picking, so, the first item measures, uhm, I speak Spanish, and then you can write that, or I speak, speak English. So, they're getting data for two scales: One is ah, uhm, the endorsement of European-American culture, and one is the endorsement on Mexican-American culture. Okay uhm, I say, we can go back to the uhm, to the slide, I think now. Okay, why I just, I, why I just wanna make a couple of points. The ARSMA-II does represent an improvement over the ARSMA-I uhm, in several different ways, and these, these are kinda, these are quotes from Cuellar(ph) et al., the, the authors ah, they say the ARSMA-II ah, may have some limited utility to Hispanic groups other than Mexican-Americans. Ah, the ARSMA-II also includes an optional experimental marginality scale, but most importantly, uhm, it includes orientation toward Mexican culture and orientation toward Anglo culture. And that, that's very important. Now, I think Cuellar et, et al. made a mistake within, though, was that they said you could, ah, if you wanna compare this to other measures, you can create a linear scale by simply taking the MOS score and subtracting it from the AOS score and you now get back to a linear measure of acculturation. And I think that shouldn't even be in there. We do, we don't wanna go back to, ah, a linear measure of acculturation. Uhm, now let's turn to the, uhm, oh, and another limitation, Cuellar et al. admit outright that their measure does not measure values. It's not, they have a few items(ph) in there about values, but mainly, it's measuring behaviors, okay? So that's the state of the art right now, and they acknowledge it doesn't measure, uhm, values. Okay, let's, ah, turn now to the problems associated with the, of the way acculturation, I've kind of talked about these. Uhm, let me just say that in their review of these acculturation measures, Kim and Abreu expressed concern about the psychometric properties of some of the instruments. For example, 74 percent of the instruments provided no evidence of retest, test-retest reliability. Less than 50 percent provided any evidence of concurrent or discriminate, uhm, validity. Currently, there's, ah, obviously, there's room for, ah, improvement in, uhm, it's the psychometric properties. For our, purs-, purposes, however, I'd like to focus on Kim and Abreu's criticisms having to do with, uhm, the format and content of the items, okay? First of all, they said that 23 of the 33 instruments, 70 percent, fit the dual-cultural unilinear model of measurement, okay, that directional model. Uhm, I have already talked about some of the criticisms of this model, but I'd like to give you a concrete example of how use of the dual-cultural, unilinear acculturation is, can make, can produce misleading results. Shelley Ruelas(ph), who happens to be in the audience right here, ah, at the counseling center here, Lucy Ramos-Sanchez and I used the ARSMA-II in a study examining the relationship between, ah, Mexican American acculturation and their attitudes towards counselors. And we found that combining the Mexican American Orientation and the Anglo Orientation Scales' scores to come up with that linear score, uhm, when we did that, we found that Mexican-Ame-, as Mexican Americans acculturate, the credibility they assign the counselor goes down, that is, the more acculturated they are, the less they view a counselor as a credible source of help. So, it sounds like there's something in the U.S. culture that makes them not like counselors as well or to become jaded about counselors or something. That was my thought, was, "Well, maybe they're just, they get jaded as they become part of, acculturated." Uhm, however, when we looked at the relationship between the Mexican Orientation Scale and the Anglo Orientation Scale separately and correlated each of them, ah, with acculturation separately, we found that it was the reli-, relinquishment of Mexican culture that was associated with loss of credibility for the counselors, and it was, had nothing to do with the Anglo orientation. So, they were coming in with all acculturated people with very positive views of this person of authority, an older person perhaps, ah, someone they would give respect to. And again, I'm reminded of, ah, James Anderson's talk about values in the culture, uhm, that we just totally overlook in African American culture, here's some values, in Hispanic culture, in Mexican American culture, in this case that we would overlook if we used these linear measures of acculturation. It was, I repeat, the loss of Mexican cultural values, not the acquis-, well, and behavior I should say because we couldn't really measure values that well but we're assuming they were losing values at possibly, anyway, they were losing behavior, ah, Mexican behavior and, uhm, though, that's what was associated with, ah, loss of credibility assigned to counselors. Uhm, okay, let's go to the, most of the instruments used, items that measured behaviors only to the exclusion. This is another criticism by Kim and Abreu of the dimensions of, uhm, with only, only a limited use of dimensions of values, knowledge and cultural identity. For 85 percent of the instruments, at least half of the items measured the behavioral dimension of acculturation. And for 36 percent of the instruments, all of the items measured behavior. So, we're relying on behavior a lot in these instruments that we have. Uhm, now here's a concrete example why it's important to measure both behaviors and values when measuring acculturation. Uhm, in Kim, Atkinson and Young, 1999, we developed a measure of Asian-American inculturation, uhm, in Asian values. So we were able to measure Asian values, which we gave to Asian-Americans along with the SL-ASIA, which we considered a measure of behavioral acculturation. And we found that Asian-Americans retained their Asian values across first, second and third generations. Even while they were losing the behaviors, they went, okay, they were becoming acculturated by a measure, a behavioral measure of acculturation. But on our measure of values, Asian values, they retained those across three generations. Uhm, to me, this suggests that all the research has been done using predominantly behavioral measures, needs to be redone with measures of, ah, of values, ah, acculturation. Okay, let's hit the next one, Daniel(ph). Uhm, some, some instruments mix the, ah, behavioral value and, uhm, cultural ethnic identity dimensions, making it difficult to, ah, infer which aspect of acculturation is reflected by the score. Uhm, well, uhm, ah, I'm gonna talk about the, the business of, ah, ethnic identity being included in measure of acculturation in just a moment. Ah, and then the, ah, fourth, ah, criticism they had is that some instruments developed for one culture were used in other cultures by merely changing the wording, like I was pointing out about the SL-ASIA. Uhm, you, the other thing is you, you can't use the same indices of acculturation, this is building on point four here, for all ethnic groups. For example, English language use or proficiency, length of residence in the US, immigration status, observance of cultural holidays may be appropriate for Asian-Americans and Latinos, but not for American Indians or African-Americans. So, ah, you know, you have to use different things to measure acculturation, still measuring, in my estimation, behaviors and values. I'd li-, uhm, I'd like to add one other criticism that I have, and that is that there's an inherent pressure in academia to be the next scholar who adds yet another dimension to something, to a highly-res-, researched topic. Uhm, in, in their effort, I think, to make more sophisticated measures of acculturation, we've been adding on things like knowledge and, uhm, ethnic identity, uhm, and onto this basic concept of behaviors and values. But ethnic identity, while it may be related to acculturation, is a distinct construct in its own right in my estimation. Ethnic identity has to do with ethnic pride and loyalty, ah, which was not included on our earlier definitions of culture, uhm, and ac-, and acculturation. Cuellar et al. suggest, and I agree, that ethnic identity mea-, ah, items measure re-, re-, the respondent's affect, how they feel about themselves, how they feel about their ethnic group and their ethnic culture. That is different than how they practice their culture, which is manifested in their behavior and values. Uhm, also, people who are six or seven gener-, uhm, generations removed from their indigenous culture may have fully acculturated in terms of values and behaviors, but still identify with their ethnic, ah, background. For example, I'm proud to be half Irish-American, but it's a stretch to say that I've retained any of my Irish values or behavior, except on St. Patrick's Day. 

00:55:05
DONALD ATKINSON Other measures of acculturation attempt to measure knowledge about the host or the indigenous culture, and again I think knowledge or culture is different than the practice of the culture. Part of multicultural competence that we try to train in counselors is having a knowledge of a culture they're not necessarily a part of. So, it's different than the practice of the culture. Uhm, on the other hand, it's particularly unfortunate so few measures of acculturation include cultural values in their, ah, measure. Szapozik, Szapocznik, back in 1978, Szapocznik et al., were among the first to publish an acculturation instrument that actually included a measure of behavioral acculturation and values acculturation. Unfortunately, they got, ah, very low reliability on their Values Acculturation Scale. And so, they concluded, and this is a quote, "Used by itself, the behavioral scale is the best available measure of acculturation." So, unfortunately, after that, everybody just kinda took off on this behavioral, ah, measure of acculturation. Okay, uhm, so what can we conclude from this review? Uhm, first of all, we have misused the term "acculturation," remember that original definition had nothing to do with the direction, uhm, by common usage, acculturation came to be associated with cultural learning in the host culture and ignoring the learning in the indigenous culture. So we have these two definitions and I think for measuring acculturation, we need to go back to the original definition. Uhm, when we talk about acculturation, we should really be talking about two processes: retention of indigenous cultural values and behaviors and acquisition of host cultural values and behaviors. In other words, we need to, four measures of acculturation. Right now, we're really getting one measure, that is, behavioral adoption of the host culture. And what we really need is four measures: behavioral retention of the indigenous culture, value retention of the indigenous culture, behavioral acquisition of the host culture and value acquisition. And, uhm, again, to avoid that use of, I, I'm, I'm trying personally to avoid the use of the term "acculturation" to mean the acquisition of the host culture, and talk instead about acquisition of values and behaviors from the, I'm not supposed to bump this (chortles) I keep bumping it. (Chortles) Uhm, and I can imagine, with the mic on, that you, you know about that. Ah, another thing that we learned from this, uhm, review is that current acculturation is misfocused, as I've said on behavior, and, uhm, so we need to develop valid reliable measures of both behavioral acculturation and values acculturation. Uhm, now, behavior is easy to measure, value's a little bit more difficult, and I was gonna give you a couple of examples how we've attempted to do it. Let me just, very quickly, tell you that when we, when we built the Asian Values Scale, which is, ah, Bryan Kim is, uhm, doing research on that right now at UCSB, uhm, and, ah, whe-, when we developed that scale, we wanted theory to guide us. So what we did was looked through the literature, try to identify all the values that were Asian, supposedly Asian values. We made a list from that. Ah, we sent that list out to a national sample of APA psychologists, Asian-American psychologists, asked them to expand upon the list and to kind of categorize the variables for us. Uhm, so we, we, ah, basically, used the literature to develop, ah, an initial list of Asian values, then we used experts to expand our list of Asian values. Uhm, then we used focus groups to expand it some more. Then we used another focus group to start narrowing it down. And then we finally got down to 14 dimensions of, of, ah, types of values, and we, uhm, picked, I think it was eight value dimensions, ah, eight, eight, ah, value statements for each of those dimensions. And, ah, so we ended up administering an instrument of 112 value dimensions to 63 European-Americans randomly selected. They're our college students, that's the handy sample of course, and 93 first-generation Asian-Americans, and compared their responses. And what we were looking for were the items that would, ah, distinguish those two. And we did come up with some items that, that distinguish them, that is that Asian-Americans endorse these values more heavily than did European-Americans. And those, uhm, items, ah, became the, ah, items that were used, there, there were 36 of them in the Asian Values Scale. Now, I'm not suggesting that that's the best way to measure values. Someone more sophisticated in measurement evaluation could do I'm sure a much better job, but it's what we did and we were able to identify these values. Uhm, I should, uhm, add though that, ah, oh, and, well, before I get to that, I, I wanna point out that, that, ah, I had other advisees who had been looking at values in Hispanic cultures, particularly Mexican-American cultures. Ah, both, both Doc Li-, Dr. Lucy Ramos-Sanchez and Dr. Liz Fraga, ah, developed scales to, uhm, measure endorsement of the following Hispanic values: "simpatia," "respeto," "personalismo," familiaism, "machismo," folk healing, reli-, religiosity, and fatalism. Their(ph) group endorse them more heavily than another (inaudible ) point. Uhm, okay. Very quickly, ah, in this presentation, I've tried to suggest that current measures of acculturation oversize, overemphasize the action of host culture, ah, for the most part (inaudible ) host behaviors, not just host culture, host behaviors were like normal values. Ah, one reason this has occurred is we got away from that original definition of culture, which, ah, stressed the roles in, ah, of both values and behavior. And, I believe that when we attempt to measure the effects of acculturation, we really measure, need to measure all four of the things that I've talked about. Ah, so what I'm really suggesting is the development of instruments that provide two subscales for each of, uhm, like this. We need a scale that measures retention of the indigenous culture and acquisition of host culture, and I think, by the way, that we need to go back and do all of our studies where we'd look at acculturation and some other variable if being able to break it down by these four variables here. Uhm, and while we can do that for Asian-Americans in general, and Has-, Hispanics in general, I think that eventually we need (inaudible ) acculturation measures for each culture that if we really wanna finely measure acculturation. Uhm, and, so I'd like to, kind of, conclude with a, uhm, ah, ah, plea to those of you who are measurement and evaluation experts or students that you not leave the development of these instruments to process and outcome researchers like myself. Please, uhm, you know, help us by doing the, ah, there, building these instruments for us so that we can (inaudible ) and, ah, uhm, I'm sure we'll, we'll all be better off for it. And those who are, ah, practitioners, uhm, I just, eh-, I'm sure you do informal measures of acculturation when (inaudible ) with a client or a student, uhm, just try to conceptualize it, not of just acquiring the dominant, and keep in mind that values are involved, not just the dominant values and behaviors, but the (inaudible ) indigenous cultures, and kind of relate it again to what Jim Mann and Jane Junn were saying, uhm, you know, "What are those values that are there that could be very useful?" With the Asian-Americans we found, uhm, that, uhm, I'm sorry, with the Mexican-American study we found that they actually, their credibility of, of, for counselors, the assigned counselors declined as they lost their culture. What other good things are we losing when they lose the values from their indigenous culture? Thank you. I don't know if we have time for further.

01:04:10
UNKNOWN Thanks, Don. We have a question/comment, ah, from the audience, from the students. 

01:04:20
DONALD ATKINSON We might(ph). (crosstalk) 

01:04:25
UNKNOWN Students? Or is somebody saying something over there? Oh yes, I'm sorry. Go on.(ph) 

01:04:25
UNKNOWN  I guess my question is, do you see very, very similar, possible similar measures being created for Native and the African-Americans, which is, like, you know, domestic minorities who share two cultures and still have to do their cultural thing even though... (crosstalk) 

01:04:40
DONALD ATKINSON Yes. 

01:04:40
UNKNOWN they've been here for generations? 

01:04:45
DONALD ATKINSON Sure. I, I just heard confirmation this morning that among African-Americans, (crosstalk) 

01:04:50
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

01:04:50
DONALD ATKINSON ...there's a culture(ph) not only as regional, but I mean, as, as there is a broad, ah, cultural base there. Why not? I mean why not identify behaviors and values that that culture most, more strongly endorse it (inaudible ) do European-Americans. And, uhm, as to how quickly it'll happen, I'm retired. (Laughs) So, but, I mean, that's the challenge. (crosstalk) 

01:05:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:05:15
DONALD ATKINSON Let's do it. We should be doing this. And I, and I hope it's soon, I mean.
