Aquarius HEALTH CARE MEDIA In Harmony with the Heart KEEPING KIDS HEALTHY Recognizing Borderline Personality Disorder in Children Keeping Kids Healthy 

00:00:30
WINNIE KING , M.D. Hello, I'm Dr. Winnie King and we are in the lobby of the children's hospital at Montefiore in New York City. So, you may hear some hospital noise in the background. Are there times when your child is so overwhelmed by his emotions that he can't think straight, are there intense rages or constant anxiety or unstable relationships. Does your daughter's attitude towards people suddenly shift from admiration and love to intense anger and dislike. Well, these are some of the symptoms of Borderline Personal Disorder or BPD. It’s a complicated diagnoses. In fact, it’s often missed entirely, but what it’s there? It can make a life excruciatingly painful for your child and for your family. Our producer Jim Bond(ph) introduces us to Sharon and her daughter Amanda. 

00:01:20
When Amanda was born, her mother couldn't believe how lucky she was. 

00:01:25
SHARON Amanda's Mother She was the perfect baby. She never cried to be fed. We had feed her by the clock, happy. 

00:01:30
But when Amanda turned one, it was clear. Something was wrong. 

00:01:35
SHARON It was almost like she couldn't comprehend and that there were consequences. If you did something, there was this consequence to it. So, it was very difficult to teach her what she could and couldn't do. 

00:01:45
In grade school, other problems. 

00:01:45
SHARON One point, she told the teacher that her brother had died, went in for a parent teacher conference and she said you know I'm so sorry about your son. She said how is your family doing now like, what are you talking about? She said your son has passed and I said I don't have any sons you know. (inaudible ) passed away. 

00:02:06
Amanda's world was becoming one of extremes. She was paranoid and hypersensitive. 

00:02:15
AMANDA I always I'm noticing everything around me even if it's just somebody cooking in heels(ph). I always noticed the sounds. 

00:02:20
Her reactions were extreme too, explosive outburst had become a regular part of her daily life. And Amanda saw everything as black or white, loving acceptance or total rejection. One day, she saw one of her best friends talking to someone Amanda didn't like. Convinced the friends was plotting against her, Amanda moved that friend out of her life. 

00:02:40
AMANDA She was immediately put in the black and that was it, I had nothing else to do with her. I felt really betrayed and I just felt like you know they were talking about me. I was constantly thinking, they were always talking about me. 

00:02:55
About the time, this home video was made… the darker more explosive world began closing in on Amanda. Now in junior high when many teens are angry with their parents… Amanda's tendency toward extreme reactions took over. She joined a gang and within months of when these pictures were taken, she made a plan with the gang to have her parents murder. Fortunately, she told her big sister Alicia about it to protect her. 

00:03:25
SHARON And she thought I'm having mummy and daddy killed, but I don't want you to die too. I got to have somebody left. So we call the police and said is it possible that this is true and the authority said that yes. It is a true gang. If they are planning on killing you, it is a true threat. You need to get your daughter out of town now. And we took her about an hour away and put her into a locked psych unit and she admitted, it was a true threat. 

00:03:55
For Sharon, Amanda's murder plot against are paled when compared to the agony of putting her youngest child in a psychiatric lock down facility. 

00:04:05
SHARON To look on her face when we left her there(ph). That was the worst moment in my life. Now, it just...You know it’s… what's best for, but you know what she is thinking of you right then. 

00:04:25
WINNIE KING No, Amanda that was ah...so many years ago and you've come such a long way from, from that point in your life, can you remember what you were thinking back then? 

00:04:35
AMANDA I can't remember Um...what I was thinking about then due to a coping mechanism in my brain. 

00:04:40
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:04:40
AMANDA It is completely blocked out a lot of what happened when I was young. 

00:04:45
WINNIE KING And some of it, it is also the disease itself. 

00:04:50
AMANDA Hmm...Yes. 

00:04:50
WINNIE KING Well, you've had to deal with a lot of issues. What would you say it's been the...the biggest obstacle that remains in your life for you to get past? 

00:05:00
AMANDA Um...I think there is two...there is two things. One is depression. It's…It's hard to when you constantly thinking of dying and that you just want to end it and...and get through it all. It's very hard to try and convince yourself there is a reason to live. And another one is um...the misinterpretations and misperceptions. I don't know what in my past is actually real or what I have just misinterpreted or misperceived or just totally my brain has told me and...and it wasn't even there. 

00:05:30
WINNIE KING Sharon, I know this was really hard for you to hear your daughter still struggling with this, you know as a parent with the child that has Borderline Personality Disorder, what's been the... the hardest thing for you to deal with? 

00:05:40
SHARON Ah...getting help there, you know finding doctors to treat her when she was first diagnosed, we were just told that she has Borderline Personality Disorder. There are no books out there, no doctors out there. She most likely won’t live until she is 18 and you might as well just wing it. So it was just trying to find help somewhere and maybe I was left all alone. There was no internet at that time. Now that we have support groups online that have children like this that can help us through it, but just trying to find help for all of us. 

00:06:10
WINNIE KING Well, Dr. Lori Greene is a psychologist who specializes in treating teens with Borderline Personality Disorder and we are so grateful that we have people like you here to help us, because this is a very tough disorder to deal with. Ah...We...We've seen that this story has so many twist and turns and elements to it. But let's go through, what are some of the classic symptoms of BPD that a parent should be looking for in their children? 

00:06:35
LORI GREENE Oh, parents are to be looking for symptoms in four areas. The first area will be impulsiveness. 

00:06:40
IMPULSIVENESS •Aggressive Behaviors, Hostility •Self-Injuring •Suicidal Tendencies •Substance Abuse •Eating Disorders 

00:06:40
LORI GREENE The impulsiveness could be aggressive behaviors or hostility toward others, or it could be self-injurious behaviors like cutting or burning oneself. It could be suicidal behaviors or thoughts that the teen is having or things like substance abuse and eating disorders. 

00:06:55
SENSITIVITY/OVERSENSITIVITY •Mood Changes •Scrutinizing Reactions •Misperceiving, Shading into Paranoia 

00:06:55
LORI GREENE And the second area would be emotional sensitivity/oversensitivity. And this is where you might see your teen acting sort of like you'd expect a burn victim to act on a burn unit. So that you know, where many of us wouldn't notice light winds going by a burn victim, it would be agonizing for and this is how these kids react. They're frap(ph)and mood changes, they scrutinize the reactions of other people, so that they interpret things as pretty negative um...sometimes just (inaudible ) answer. This can shade over into paranoia so that they think things that had nothing to do with them or really negative things about them. 

00:07:30
RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS •Fleeting Relationships •Black & White/Hot & Cold •Unrelenting Crises 

00:07:30
LORI GREENE And then the next area will be relationship issues where the relationship seemed to be really fleeting in nature um...They might run black and white or hot and cold with people, your enemy today, your best friend today is your enemy tomorrow. Um...And then also they might drive some of their peers away with unrelenting crises that are going on in our lives which are hard to deal with. 

00:07:50
TROUBLE THINKING CLEARLY •Can't Problem Solve 

00:07:50
LORI GREENE And then finally, this is an area where the teens might have trouble thinking clearly. It's hard for them the problem solve um...because there are so much going on in their heads. 

00:08:00
WINNIE KING Well, a lot going on, does the sound similar to you? 

00:08:05
AMANDA Yes, very much. 

00:08:05
WINNIE KING Yeah, Sharon? 

00:08:05
SHARON Oh, absolutely. 

00:08:05
WINNIE KING Yeah. Well, you know that's what Borderline Personality looks like from the outside, but let's take a look, at what it feels like on the inside? 

00:08:15
Yap, there is Pam. 

00:08:15
This is a home video of a beach side vacation for Amanda and her family. 

00:08:20
SHARON And that Amanda... 

00:08:25
JIM BOND Amanda has been severely depressed and she has began cutting herself. She now talks openly about that and what's it like inside the mind of someone with BPD. 

00:08:35
AMANDA It's very confusing as to why I'm thinking a certain way and feeling a certain way and that's not the way it's...really happening but my brain is telling me it is. Um... right for instance with the self mutilation I have always thought it's perfectly normal. I don't see why everybody else doesn't do it. 

00:08:55
Is that right? 

00:08:55
Interesting. 

00:08:55
AMANDA To me, it's just perfectly normal. It's a way of relive stress. 

00:09:00
Amanda's description of her hypersensitivity also shows not only how aware she is of her surroundings, but how difficult it is for her to react normally. 

00:09:10
AMANDA Anytime, pictures are not perfectly aligned or like we are talking about the different woods, one would be Mahogany, one would be Cherry wood, one would be Oak, they'll just be totally out there and it's just not all coordinated, it just doesn't all fit together. 

00:09:25
But for you, it's not just something that you noticed, it's something... 

00:09:30
AMANDA It's something that I sit there and think about them you know like I need to tell them to change that wood. I need to tell them to... 

00:09:35
She'll literally get upset. 

00:09:40
AMANDA And I'll sit there, I'll start shaking my leg real bad, it all literally it will just drive me absolutely bananas. 

00:09:45
Amanda has a name for what goes on inside her mind. 

00:09:50
AMANDA You know, I called my twisted brain, because it likes to twist around on itself and... and go through all these wacky things to try and get to the real thing that's going on. It's...It's kind of like your dreams. You can't control your dreams. 

00:10:00
That must be very hard though where somebody comes and says well, that's not normal. Why are you doing that and feel so normal to you. 

00:10:10
AMANDA Yeah. I have a...a bit of trouble just thinking why as everybody else you know able to do normal things enable to act normal and I can't. There is a lot of times I feel helpless and alone and that just nobody understands and um... It is hard to… to realize that you're just a little out there in your thinking. 

00:10:40
WINNIE KING It must be a strange place to...to be ah...Amanda can you tell when you're overreacting, can you actually feel it? 

00:10:45
AMANDA Um...I can't really feel it and I can't say that we, even realize because it's your brain... 

00:10:50
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:10:50
AMANDA And your brains telling you, so we can't really... we don't know we are doing anything different or. 

00:10:55
WINNIE KING So, do you like make-ups stories in your... in your brain to sort of explain was going on? 

00:11:00
AMANDA Yeah, I can, there can be a story and even that can be no reason for it, but for some reason our brain is trying to find a way to...to figure out what's going on and to tell people what's going on, but we can't find a straight pathway to... 

00:11:15
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:11:15
AMANDA …the answer. 

00:11:20
WINNIE KING Well, Olivia also has Borderline Personality Disorder and she is here with her mother Allyson. And Olivia, let me...let me ask you this. Ah...how does that compare with how you feel what you just heard Amanda said? 

00:11:30
OLIVIA Well, Borderline Personality you know with me that Um...I can have something in my mind that can be completely fantasy in my head and give me five, ten minutes and I can make myself believe it 100%. 

00:11:45
WINNIE KING Uh…huh… 

00:11:50
OLIVIA And it's not something that I want to do, it's not something that I want to believe or it could be something that I do want to believe and automatically in my head, it's something that is true. Hence it's hard for my family, it's hard for me because it's hard for my parents to believe me because they'll know that I'm not telling the truth. 

00:12:10
WINNIE KING Right. 

00:12:10
OLIVIA But I won't know. 

00:12:15
WINNIE KING Right. It...It just make perfect sense to you at that point. Well, you know Allyson, I understand that Olivia has been in counseling since she was 11 that at one point, she actually started self mutilating... 

00:12:20
ALLYSON That's right. 

00:12:25
WINNIE KING And um...you know this is overwhelming for a parent. How...how are you able to figure out that this was an actual diagnosable illness and not just bad behavior? 

00:12:35
ALLYSON Olivia's Mother Um...when Olivia was about 13, it was really after my died, um...she started with depression Um...and the...she also started self mutilating, cutting herself on her wrist and you know as we brought her to a psychiatrist um...and I had started in a therapy myself and um...you know I talked a lot about Olivia and her problems and how to cope with them. And after about a year, year and a half when Olivia was about 14, my therapist said have you ever considered Borderline Personality, have you heard of it? And I...I've never heard of it and she gave a pamphlet and it was like I was reading about Olivia. 

00:13:10
WINNIE KING Lori, you must hear that all the time. 

00:13:10
LORI GREENE Oh, all the time, I can't tell you how often I tell parents the symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder and they say oh finally something that describes my child. 

00:13:20
WINNIE KING Well, let's talk Lori for a second about what this is? You know, what...what causes this? 

00:13:25
LORI GREENE Ph.D. Psychologist Yeah. Well, Borderline Personality Disorder is...is caused by what we call the Biosocial Theory that Um...these kids are sort of from birth biologically sensitive or biologically vulnerable to this emotionality we see. And then they put take these emotional kids and put them in environment and the environment can be a very invalidating environment. It could be something as severe as abuse or neglect or it can be wonderful parents like these acting the way that wonderful parents act. But the way that it interacts with this particular biologically vulnerable kid and transacts and acts upon each other, eventually, we can see BPD. 

00:14:00
WINNIE KING Well. Well, because the interaction between kids and parents is so critical in BPD, parents actually need special training because the techniques that work best aren't the kind that come naturally to most people. Tom and Dixie Penny(ph) teach a class and what's call Dialectical Behavior Therapy or DBT to show parents how to communicate more effectively with their teens. 

00:14:25
You're treating me like a baby. 

00:14:25
Parents: Don't Be So Judgmental 

00:14:25
You are looking at a class in parent communication skills. Rule number one stop being so judgmental. Instead be more understanding and validating towards your child. 

00:14:35
You know what I'm...I want to give a party this weekend. 

00:14:40
For example, your daughter wants to serve alcohol at her party. How should you respond? Here is a role play. 

00:14:45
"Teen" "Father" 

00:14:45
I'm going to sneak in a few beers because if I don't do this, I'm not going to be popular and nobody is going to come to the party. 

00:14:50
I think that what's your saying is absolutely not, you must be out of your...out of your gourd... 

00:15:00
Dad...dad I... 

00:15:00
…even suggest such a thing. 

00:15:05
Let's try a more understanding approach. 

00:15:05
You definitely want to have a party and I think that sounds good, but I just can't go along, I can't go along with the alcohol part where there are must be something that I could bring, I mean could I cook out could we have stakes and I could be outside cooking the hamburgers and... and then I will be around, but I wouldn't be in your face all the time, how would that be? 

00:15:30
TEEN That sounds kind a cool dad, thanks. 

00:15:35
Even if real life disputes don't end that easily the effort to withhold judgment reduces the blow ups on both sides. 

00:15:40
MARY Takes it totally from an anger situation to a calm situation we can actually start be getting to talk in a... in a productive way. 

00:15:50
And that helps parents and teens work together to change. Case in point, these role play about a teen who comes home three hours after curfew. 

00:15:55
“Teen” “Mother” 

00:16:00
MARY Yeah what you'r looking at? 

00:16:00
Well two things, I am glad to see you, I am happy you are here but I've been scared to death. 

00:16:05
The mother in this role play will follow the rules of a communication system called Dear Man, that helps parents get their way while keeping the relationship with their child. 

00:16:15
“DEAR MAN” D - Describe E - Express A - Ask R - Reward 

00:16:15
Dear Man is an acronym the “D” stands for describe the situation. 

00:16:20
Here it is 3’o clock in the morning you would do home at midnight. 

00:16:25
“E” express how you feel. 

00:16:30
Dad and I were scared to death thinking are you in a hospital, are you in trouble. 

00:16:35
“A” ask for what you want. 

00:16:40
MARY You worry too much. 

00:16:40
HARRIET Well may be you could help me to worry less. First of all do you think you could leave your cell phone… phone on? 

00:16:45
And finally “R” a reward forgiving you what do you want. And this role play there is also a consequence for bad behavior. 

00:16:55
Um… tomorrow night you, you're grounded on Sunday night I’d like you to be able to go out, on that night I need to see that you have your cell phone and you can stay out again till 12. 

00:17:05
Parents say DBT skills are a huge help to their family. 

00:17:10
HARRIET There is no screaming, there is less anger, and there is much more communication. 

00:17:15
IZABELLA The parents are suffering but the child is suffering more. And when you start understanding it you start to react to the child differently instead of anger you, you start to show compassion. 

00:17:30
WINNI KING Well Sharon and Allyson either of you had this kind of training? 

00:17:30
SHARON No it’s not available it’s very hard to find. 

00:17:35
WINNI KING Yeah what about you Allyson? 

00:17:35
ALLYSON No I’m in search of it. I've heard it’s extremely helpful if you find the right group. 

00:17:40
WINNI KING Well Lori you know obviously ah… you work with parents quite a bit but you also work with the teens, tell us about that? 

00:17:45
LORI GREENE Okay, well what we do with um...teens with borderline personality disorder is we do dialectical behavior therapy DBT as we saw in the video and in DBT with teens there is two meetings during the week, the teen will meet in with the individual DBT therapist once a week. And once a week the family either in a multifamily group or as an individual family will come to skills training. And in skills training they'll learn how to manage their stress better so as not to act impulsively, they'll learn how to regulate or even out their emotions a little bit. Um… they'll learn how to navigate relationships better like you so with the Dear Man skill, um… they'll learn how to be more mindful so as to access that wiser part of your brain the kind of just knows the right decision so clear up some confusion. And the finally and this is unique to DBT for teens um… we'll teach the families something about balance a validation and chance. So for example if your team come home and says I had a really bad day, I think I am going to cut myself. Instead of saying well don’t do that, cutting yourself isn’t a good solution, you might say well you know given everything you’ve been through and given your symptoms and given your history of course that’s your really natural inclination is to think about cutting. However let’s think about a skill you can use that you can make a more wise decisions. So there kind of bal… bal… balancing, validating the, the desire of the urge with helping the teenager make a change in their behavior. 

00:19:05
WINNI KING Well I could see where that would make a huge, huge difference well as Sharon and Amanda found when parents and children begin to understand the disorder and work together they can’t live in harmony by taking things one day at a time. 

00:19:20
AMANDA A normal day well I am a bit of a hermit. I don’t like to go out. So I usually just stay home, I have a computer that I like to do things on and play games on and stuff like that. I do like to crochet especially while I am watching a movie or something I’ll crochet a blanket and stuffs in it. Um… I like to give things to other people and to do things for other people so it really makes me feel good like when I make blankets for friends... anytime I go to any store I constantly thinking in my head just get what I need and get home and you know where can I relax and be safe. 

00:20:00
Let’s get the table set and then I’ll start getting the soup ready. 

00:20:05
AMANDA My mom is a big, big support system for me and a lot of it also comes from validation that it’s okay to feel this way there is a reason you're feeling this way. When I do have rough times and stuff she'll say it’s a valid thing to be fiddling right now and that will help lift a big stress off my shoulders… goes on your right, what goes on your left… it’s really helpful and there is a lot of time that I’ll miss perceive something or something like that and she'll help me to see what’s really going on and that what my brain is telling me is going on. This kind of like training, trying to get my brain to receive the right signals and tell me what’s going on. Then with the black and white it’s a big thing for me too because I have learned that I can enjoy things that are ness… not necessarily on the white or you know that I can um… it’s help me a lot with people I can accept more things and I can you know have an open mind and, and not be where it’s either black or it’s white. There are some people in my life right now that I would have put in the black zone, I would ...have never talk to, I would have you know just kept my distance and... And now in that I see there are some good points. I’ll tell my mom all the time that I wouldn't have made it this long if hadn't had someone to help me through the rough times or even ask her sometimes if this part of my BPT is this way I am thinking this way or is this normal. 

00:21:45
WINNI KING Well you know it’s nice to be in a place when your relationship where you can actually talk about it. You know Olivia had you reached a point where you can tell when it’s your BPT talking? 

00:21:55
OLIVIA I haven’t really come to that point yet, because hmm… I haven’t really come to the point in my therapy where I can really believe that I really have BPT, I am really stuck in a point where I am in denial that I have it because of the negativity that comes towards BPT. Um… people really they really don’t have good view on borderline personality they think that it is basically people who are dramatic, attention seeking and it’s all they see. 

00:22:30
WINNI KING Hmm… hmm… 

00:22:30
OLIVIA And I don't want people to see me that way so I, I basically think to myself well I am not that way, I don’t have borderline… 

00:22:35
WINNI KING Yeah. 

00:22:35
OLIVIA I am not. 

00:22:35
WINNI KING Yeah. 

00:22:40
OLIVIA Don’t… don’t come in… don’t come in. 

00:22:40
WINNI KING Yeah, sure well I can certainly understand that. But you know besides the negative things that people often associate with borderline you um… both you Allyson, and Sharon um… have said that your daughters are both very compassionate. 

00:22:50
ALLYSON Yes. 

00:22:55
WINNI KING Tell, tell, tell me about that. 

00:22:55
ALLYSON Um… Olivia has always been a very compassionate person um… she is just, she is very sensitive, she has a huge heart, um… she loves animals, she is volunteering at a animal shelter right now. And um… you know I, I guess a lot of people in my household if I'm upset of something Olivia really keys in on that she is very perceptive and she is very caring and loving and I think that’s a good treat to have. 

00:23:20
WINNI KING Yes I see her smiling as you describe all those characteristics, Sharon what about you? 

00:23:25
SHARON Um… same as Allyson our kids yeah, their special you know they can be a real pain in the neck but then other times like when my husband passed away Amanda was my rock she was there for me every minute in the way. 

00:23:35
WINNI KING Yeah, well Amanda what would you like to share um… about the, the hurt that you’ve caused to people with your borderline? 

00:23:40
AMANDA Um… I do understand and um… I think a lot of us have to understand that we do hurt other people. And that I just like to let them know that along with hurting other people that it’s because of our inner turmoil that in our pain, in our suffering that we’re doing these things. We're not doing it on purpose to hurt you, we are hurting so much and we don’t know the, the right way to express it. So we express it in some other wrong ways. 

00:24:10
WINNI KING Yeah and it’s so important for you to say that because people reacting your behavior and then they get caught up in that… 

00:24:15
AMANDA Right. 

00:24:15
WINNI KING …and they miss the point that the behavior is representative of, of something else. Olivia what closing thoughts would you like to share? 

00:24:25
OLIVIA I think the most important things that I have to say are to children who are in my age or any age who have stating to feel feelings of loneliness, hopelessness, helplessness. If you're having these feelings the most important thing to do is tell your parents, tell a doctor, don’t keep it inside, because it’s not normal to feel this way but at the same time you're not alone. Though our people who have these feelings there are people there, the people who are going to help you. You can’t keep it inside because things are going to happen, it’s going to get worse. And to parents this is the most important thing that I can say to you. The thing is your kids do when they hurt themselves it’s not your fault, it definitely is not your fault, it’s because of the pain that they have inside of them is not anything you’ve done wrong while trying to, while trying raise them or anything like that. 

00:25:20
