UNKNOWN Good afternoon. We are going to talk about what we have learned about how the brain works and what that means for trauma treatment and helping people to move past their traumatic past experiences. So let's start with how the brain develops. And, the brain isn't part of our being. It gets formed on the base of the interactions we, we have with, with the environment. And so the nature of our attachment relationships determine what our brain looks like. My colleague, Bruce Perry, puts it best, he calls it, the brain develops in a use dependent manner. So, as you grow, and you meet a world around you, um, you, your world, your brain adjusts itself to what it needs to deal with. So, if you have a secure brain, I imagine like this kid in the slide does, um, uh, you learn to play, you learn to explore, you learn to experience what's good and what doesn't feel good, you learn to see what impact you have on the world, and what you can do, and how you can manipulate things around you. If you grow up, uh, frightened, bullied, molested, hurt, neglected, abandoned, you develop a brain that is good at dealing with threat, hurt, pain, neglect, um, but often times at the expense of playing, exploration, the other things. Um, so, in some ways, what we are born with and what we grow up with, to some degree, determines what we get to live with for the rest of our lives, and one of the big challenges of our field, which we know very little about at this point, is to what degree we can change the brain, uh, once it has set, been set to deal with fear, threat, and terror. So, this is how, how normal brains develop: They develop in the context of relationships, develop in the context of being seen, being heard, and being moved. One of the most important things we learn is that, uh, brains develop on the basis of moving, touching, feeling, experience things, it goes back and forth. And so you're, if you remember yourself as a parent, um, or you observe parents and children, you see them laughing together, moving together, doing things together. It's very rhythmical, very, very physical. Uh, for about two years, kids have hardly any language, but they are very involved in the world in the following manner. Let's say, here's the, a two year ol-, two month old kid playing with his mother. So here's this child, um, having a fantastic time, filled with joy and pleasure, um, because he's feeling great because he's pulling on his mother's red hair, and he feels this tension, and he feels this power. He is screaming, makes him feel powerful because he's having an action on the world around him. And the reason that he's feeling so cheerful is because he doesn't understand what the screaming and pulling is about, because this whole front of his brain, over here, has nothing sitting there. So he doesn't know what other people are thinking, what other people are feeling, um, so he's just, knows what he, he feels himself. The mother starts off having a full brain, front of the brain's intact, (inaudible )so she knows that he baby's having fun, but her, she feels more and more pain, and as she feels more and more pain, she becomes a little bit more like the baby, namely her frontal lobe, her thinking part of the world, uh, of her brain sort of goes offline, and we become threatened and feel hurt, we take leave of our senses, we start f-fighting for survival, she starts fighting for survival, and she starts pulling back. And so, then you see this child and his mother fighting for survival, and one of the nice things about raising kids is that parents are stronger than their babies, and this fight always ends up with the mother winning, which is good. Um, and so what happens now is that the baby, uh, looks at his mom, and what he sees is a really scary face. Now, this baby already has a little area in the back of his brain called the amygdala that is just beginning to come online. The amygdala tells you what is safe and what is dangerous in the world. And so, as this baby registers this scary face, the amygdala says, oh boy, there's bad stuff going on, so the baby learns to protect itself, and, and moves his hands in front of his face, and by denying and not looking, reality disappears. I remember doing that as a kid, I see politicians do it all the time, I heard something scary, you just sort of ignore that it's happening. And what happens now is, the mother, in response to her child withdrawing, starts making all kinds of gestures, and movement, and weird sounds like doo doo ba ba ba, my little baby, have, it's the universal language of how mothers and infants get on together, fathers, lovers, (ph)hundreds of people do that, there's not much mental content to it. But, eh, mother keeps sort of touching, and playing, and making funny sounds, and the baby starts looking, underneath his arms, if the coast is clear. Now he v-, turns into a friendly face, and he says it's okay, and then the baby relaxes. And so, just a rhythm with which the brain develops. And the more of these interactions you have, of something is scary, but it gets repaired, something's upsetting, but it gets repaired, and you have this back and forth of paying attention. That determines how lively and how engaged a brain you get. If you don't get a lot of those interactions, your brain doesn't mature very well, uh, intelligence quotient goes down, a fair amount of research shows that, if you don't have a lot of interactions like that, you become less intelligent, less capable of regulating yourself, and so it's these interactions that actually shape the brain. The brain is an organism, uh, an organ that gets formed in the context of rhythmical, moratoric, physical, tactile interactions with the world around it. Well, a number of years ago, there was a major discovery. It was a discovery in Italy at University of Bologna. There's a researcher who's work, working with monkeys, and he has this monkey's brain all wired up, and he sees on the screen, and he is moving his arm to put some pellets in a box, and he looks up on the screen, and he sees that the part of the brain that he sees projected up there, where the arm movements are located, is lighting up. And he says, that's weird, that's not my brain, it's the monkey's brain. And he says, that's interesting, that monkey is making the same movements in its brain as I'm moving. And that just, that led to the discovery of something called mirror neurons, and that's how we pick up each other's movements, each other's rhythms, and each other's, uh, being in the world. And what was discovered there is how we are deeply interactive creatures, and through our life we pick up each other's movements, each other's, um, physical experiences, and particularly each other's faces, voices, and we get influenced by each other. And so, this is part of a whole field called interpersonal neurobiology, which talks about how our bodies, our brains, our beings, are affected by other brains and vice versa. And so we're all clusters of human beings, creatures, that work together. Now, the b-, the way that the brain is wired is that when we have interactions with people, it goes straight to the reward system of the brain, we like talking with p-people, we like being with people, we like to be paid attention to, and when we have these experiences, it tweaks the reward system in the brain and increases the dopamine and the norepinephrine in the reward system of the brain, which gives you a feeling of sensations called pleasure safety, and when it, takes care of the hormones that regulate stress. I learned this from Bruce Perry, by the way. Um, now, so this is sort of our basic makeup, we are interpersonal creatures, we get pleasure out of being with other people, we get pleasure out of being understood, and when that system breaks down and nobody pays attention to us, um, we are isolated, people shake their head when we talk, people ignore us, people have, force us to fill out the insurance forms rather than asking what's wrong with is, and we're being shoved aside and being told, why don't you wait your turn? Uh, you don't really count here, the most important thing is whether we, we make money for the corporation, then people start feeling bad. And so again the reward system in the brain doesn't work very well, and now we need to regulate the reward system. Now, how do we do that other than through interpersonal interactions? The oldest and the most profound way in which certainly people who find their origin in Europe, which is still the majority of American, the American population, (ph)is that, is by drinking alcohol. And in, um, European culture, north American culture, alcohol has always been the primary way in which people try to calm themselves down, soothe themselves, take care of themselves, and that culture persists to this day, uh, basically our culture is still, if you feel bad, you should take something to make you feel better. And psychiatry is very much, uh, predicated on the notion if you feel bad, if you feel depressed, if you're upset, if you feel anxious, if you feel something, you should ingest something to make you feel better. And so our culture is a deeply profound what they call post-alcoholic culture, where the answer to troubles is to ingest a chemical substance to make yourself feel different. And that culture plays itself out outside of medicine also, um, so, what do people do? They make, also, make that reward system come online by eating sweet, salty, and fatty foods. That also makes people feel better. Or, you can also take drugs of abuse, cocaine, heroin, (ph)stimulus, and it also works in the same system, so if you're totally lonely, upset, and nobody ever listens to you, drugs are a great answer to take care of that. And so it's not surprising that people who have been traumatized, ignored, abused, molested, have a ten-, not to go this route primarily, but to primarily go the route of taking things and doing things to take care of that reward system. And the question is really, that once your, that part of your brain that gets pleasure out of interpersonal relationships is broken, or doesn't work very well, how easy it is to restore that and help people to not only find solace in drugs, alcohol, and food is a major challenge. It's a major challenge for our field, yeah? So, um, let's go and talk about the brain, because the last two decades have been the decades of the brain, and maybe I'm prejudiced, but I think most things that we know, we knew already before we knew about the brain. But learning about the brain has really made a very big difference in how we can approach things. So, the paradigm in our world has shifted because we understand better what the brain does. And so here we see a brain in front of us, and what we see here is, uh, that little sliver in the front of our brain is the part of us that we call ourselves. That's our, when you tell me a story, when we talk to each other, we use this part of our brain. And as human beings, we think that this part of the brain runs the show, uh, that part of our brain that has language, has awareness, has consciousness, and we tend to believe that we are more or less in charge of how we feel, how we're doing. But when you look at the brain, you get confronted with the fact that that's not really the case. But you sort of look at the brain, and you start at the bottom here, the brain stem, eh, the brain stem part of your brain, um, determines how aroused you are, how engaged you are, how sleepy you are, how hungry you are, all the things that we already see in small babies who are, have no control over their being at all, but who are sort of caught in between hunger, and sleeping, and exploring, and, um, needing to dirty their diapers, and they have no control over any of that stuff, and that's how we start off. And that part of our brain continues to be, um, a very important part of our being. Uh, so when you get traumatized, when you get upset, when you get, uh, terrible news, something terrible happens to you, what gets affected by, in your brain by the, had a bad situation, is your core vagal system. So you hear a bad piece of news, you cannot sleep any more, or you sleep all the time, or you eat all the time, or you starve yourself, and you get angry, and upset, and cannot control this, that part of your brain that you see so prominently in babies. And so that's sort of a core system of our brain that we actually have very little control over, and I would like to talk about that. Now you have this middle part of the brain, a yellow part, which is our limbic system. And that part of our brain gets formed in the context of experience. So you come into the world and there's all kind of pre-programmed stuff in our genes, but how it all is expressed depends on what sort of experiences you have. So if you're a person who is welcomed in this world and when you're a little kid, um, infant, and a young child, and you walk into the room and peoples' faces light up, and people say, I'm so glad to see you, and you're wonderful, and you're terrific, that part becomes, that all becomes part of the wiring of your own brain, and so if you're surrounded by enjoyable and good things, you get a sense of, the core of your brain says the world is a good place, it's interesting, it's, it's fun, it's rewarding, I'm a good person, and, um, if you're a small child and nobody ever smiles at you, and nobody is happy to see you, and you run into gloomy, unhappy, miserable, downcast faces, and nobody ever touches you, you develop a brain that is basically, doesn't get sort of configured to take in the milk of human kindness, um, you don't get a sense of the world is a good and safe place, and that becomes part of the wiring of your brain. It becomes extraordinarily difficult to challenge, to, to change because the brain really forms in the context of social experiences. So, on top of that you got this frontal lobe, the front part of your brain that allows you to speak, have language, anticipate the consequences of your actions, understand what the meaning of it all is, and it comes online way beyond the other pieces of your, of your brain, and that allows you to understand things. But, so what happens at the core is that, as human beings, we still have these three parts of our, of our brain. We still have that core arousal system over here that we cannot really do a lot about by talking or understanding, it's very hard to talk yourself into falling asleep, it's very hard to talk yourself into not being hungry, and it's very hard to talk yourself into not being panicky, uh, those are things that are not under your conscious control, certainly not by understanding and meaning making. And so, the next piece of the brain, that limbic system, is sort of your core orientation to the world of what is safe, what is dangerous, what feels good, and what feels bad. And that's, again, pretty much hard wired, and again, quite hard to change over time. So, here you see these three parts of the brain in more detail. Uh, so, the core part of your brain eh, the, the, the brain stem is about basic housekeeping functions, gets very affected by trauma, sleeping, breathing, um, chemical balance through urination, defecation. The next part of the brain is the limbic system. It tells you, um, what emotional importance of things are, um, what's good, what's bad, and who am I in relationship to my surroundings, and then the last part of the brain is the prefrontal cortex that is in charge of planning, anticipation of what's happening, sense of time, context, and also the part of the brain that tells you, I may feel this way, but I'm not going to act on it because terrible things will happen to me. Um, so let's start with the core arousal system. Uh, basically our brain stem, which is where it all starts, has two systems, two systems of arousal, one of which is the parasympathetic nerv-, nervous system, dorsal vagal system, and that's the part of your body that's in charge of keeping your body okay. So it is in charge of breathing, wound healing, digestion, basic bodily functions. The next thing that developed is an area right next to it, is the sympathetic nervous system, because as, when we became creatures, animals, human beings need to move, need to get something, need to find food, need to find a mate, need to f-, build a shelter. So it's a, we have a moving part of our brain, and that's the sympathetic nervous system. It's run by a different set of chemicals, um, adrenaline type chemicals. And so these two systems live side by side. And so when you deal with very small babies, or with snakes, which have essentially still the same brain, um, you have creatures who are either or. They're either into themselves, they're either sleeping and digesting, or they're moving, and attacking, and screaming, and doing other things. And so it's all or nothing. But, then, as you move up the evolutionary ladder, or as your child grows up, it cannot just live in its, its own world, it needs to learn how to relate to other creatures. That's why in the animal kingdom you see that, um, zebras live in herds, eh, as do wildebeest, and giraffes, and lions, and bears, and they all live with other creatures. So in order to adjust yourself to other creatures, you need to find a way of bringing your own physiology and your own arousal system in harmony with the arousal system of the people around you. So that's what babies need to learn, and that's what, all we, also something we had to learn, um, through, in the course of evolution. Um, and in order to do so, something that we, the animal kingdom, and human beings in particular, developed a third system that my friend, uh, Steven Borgess calls the social vagus system, the, the, the smart vagus. It's the part of the brain that sort of keeps these two things in balance, the fighting, fleeing, moving, versus the self regulation piece, and so the ventral vagus nerve, here, it regulates the relative balance between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system. Now how does it do that? It does that via reciprocal ennervations between the brain and the body. And so, this, you see these yellow nerves going back and forth between the voice box, the larynx, and the brain, the heart and the brain, the lungs and the brain, and the brain says, uh, your body resonates with the state of your brain, and you notice when you make a phone call to a person who is near and dear to you, and that person picks up the phone, and they say, high honey, and the f-, and so their voice box will tell you how they're doing, and the moment you hear this up tight tone of voice, you'll say, what's wrong? And the person will say, I'm fine. And so they, their brain stem says, I'm really scared of something, I'm really up tight, but their frontal lobe, which is way far away from this, uh, will say, I'm fine. But you, knowing that person, knows that what their frontal lobe is saying is not really the truth, and of course you can hear from that tone of voice that something is bothering them. They may not know that, but the deeper part of their brain is saying, I'm scared, up tight, something is going on. And so when people get scared and up tight, that, that core system over here will express what's going on, and it's expressed by your tone of voice, it's expressed by your breathing becoming faster or slower, your heart speeding up or slowing down, and so that core physiology really captures the emotional state. What also, um, is affected by the system are the facial nerves, and so how do we regulate each other? We regulate ourselves through our facial muscles. Uh, so if you're upset, and you see somebody who you love, and that person looks at you warmly and lovingly, and stares you in the eye, that affects your emotional state and goes straight into the arousal system of your brain, and you hear that voice, and you see that face, and you calm yourself down. And so the basic, uh, the basic foundation of self regulation is the faces and voices of your fellow creatures. And so as therapists, the most important tools we may have is the warmth and interest in our faces and the warmth and interest in our voices. What we say may be less important than how we say it and the warmth, and the acceptance, and the quality of our faces and our voices. So, basically these are all things I learned from Steven Borgess is that, as human beings, uh, we have three ways of reacting to, um, stress. The most elementary, the most common ways that when we get upset we reach out, we activate that ventral vagal system, and we look for somebody to talk to, somebody to listen to us, somebody to be with us, and somebody to comfort us. And so we are deeply social creatures who need other creatures to help us to regulate our arousal and internal states. That doesn't always work. On the right hand picture, you see something that most people I know have experienced also, something call, called, n-, something like road rage. So if you're in a state of road rage, uh, which occurs when somebody threatens you, you don't see their face, and you go into this very primitive state of mind where you want to go kill and do things, and you lose that social nervous system, and you go back and become a very primitive, fighting, aggressive animal who fights for, um, her life, or his life. And so that's one way. And so, if you're, if you have a lot of experiences early on in life of feeling threatened, and if you cannot count on somebody being there for you to calm you down, your chances that you will tend to go into that road rage mode very easily, uh, because you, you're really cannot make use of other human beings very well to calm yourself down. That, for many traumatized people, uh, becomes the predominant way of being in the world, namely the moment you feel threatened, instead of looking for other people to help you to calm yourself down, you go into a state of road rage in which you can do all kind of dangerous things, one of the hard wired parts of our brain. And that's the sympathetic nervous system going out of control. Um, there's a third way of doing things, um, namely in response to threat if there's nobody there, again, to calm yourself, calm yourself down. You learn, um, we learned very early on in the course of evolution, is that when we were still living in the jungle and all kind of predators wanted to eat us up, we got, came to understand, or our brain got to know, that if you are easy prey, if you play dead, the predators will probably pass you by, because in the jungle, you know that if you eat dead food, that food is likely to be filled with, with bacteria and (ph)baggage and you get sick. And so we, something in us remembers that, so we know that if we play dead, the pred-, predator is likely to pass us by. And so many (inaudible )traumatized people, their way of dealing with stress is to shut themselves down, to disappear, and to go offline. Uh, so we have these three ways of, of adjusting to threat, um, and of course as therapists, we hope that people can rely on the left hand side adaptation, namely finding comfort and solace in the company of other people, but many of our patients cannot do that and automatically go into the state of high arousal and high threat and, and shut down. And so that leaves us to another, uh, some other complexes. Uh, before I go into it, let me talk about something else. And that is, let's go back to the brain, huh? Um, there's this part of the brain that we really rely on, on, um, controlling our lives, running our lives, and it's our frontal lobe. And so I'd like to say something about the frontal lobe. So here you see a picture, and the blue is the frontal lobe. Babies don't have that, and when babies are born, they slowly, this part of the br-, brains slowly grow. And so the first thing that grows is this area right above your eyes over here. And so let's say if you're, um, a three month old baby, you may decide that it's very much fun to bite your mother's nipple, and, um, the, the, the, the, what's on the other side of the nipple may be screaming and pulling things back, but you have no concept of what is going on there, because you're just in your own mind, you don't have a brain yet. Uh, and so you keep biting, uh, almost regardless of what happens on the other side. And then after a while, at age six months or nine months, you find out that, uh, maybe I shouldn't be biting this nipple even though it feels really good, because when that happens I don't get food, or that person is screaming, and maybe that's not a good idea, and you learn to inhibit that wonderful biting impulse, and you can do that because of your orbital frontal cortex, the area of your brain around here which begins to grow, uh, begins to tell you, if you keep doing that, terrible things are going to happen, yeah? So it allows your brain to develop an idea of the consequences of your actions, that if you do something, it has a certain effect on the world around you, the causality piece. So that's an important thing to develop. Gets messed with with trauma, as I'll show you. Um, the next piece of the brain that becomes very important is the area called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is a part of your brain that takes in what comes into your senses and compares with what you know already, and then you formulate a plan of action. And so even as I talk to you, and if you can make sense of what I'm saying to you, you say to yourself, oh that's interesting, maybe I will do this with my patients, or I'll change my practice in order to do something. That's courtesy of your dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that allows you to learn from experience, and to, gives you a sense of time, oh now I understand. So next time this happens, I'll do things differently. And so this is really the crowning glory about the human mind is that we are able to learn from experience, and able to plan for the future, and able to have this sense of time, of if this is happening now, in the future I am going to do something else. Gets very messed up by trauma. And so here's the example of a piece of research by a colleague of mine here at Harvard, Enrico Mezzacappa, who studies a group of boys in the course of development. And the green line here is a group of boys who are normal, well developed boys, nice parents, nice little (ph)Boston kids, and every year, as these kids grow up, they become a little bit more mindful, a little bit more thoughtful, a little bit more socialized, a little bit more like, okay, I need to behave myself, otherwise terrible things will happen to me. If I do this, I know that certain things are going to happen. And so this is about the development of executive functioning, which is really dev-, the development of this frontal lobe of the brain. Here's a group of kids who have learning disabilities, who have ADHD, who are depressed, who are just kids who aren't, who weren't all wired very well. But Enrico thinks that they, that they have nice parents, thoughtful parents, and, uh, they sort of grow up in a good surroundings, and we can see, it said every year these kids also develop, have an increase in the executive functioning, and by the time they're s-, 16 or 18 years old, they do pretty well, they're pretty much beginning to catch up to that other group of kids. So your brain still develops it if y-, as long as you're safe, in a, in a, in a reasonable way, even though you started off not doing so well. This happens to be a group of abused boys, and these abused boys do not really learn executive functioning, they not, do not learn the consequences of their actions, they do not learn, um, like, if I keep doing this I'll have to go to jail, if I keep taking drugs, I'll drop out of school and never will be able to make a living for myself. So what Enrico shows is that if you get abused, neglected, um, it's very hard to develop that executive functioning, the part of your brain that knows that you shouldn't be doing things. Now what's ironic is that most of our programs for juvenile delinquents, kids who keep doing things even though it has bad consequences, are finger wagging programs, they go like, if you ever do this again, terrible things will happen to you. Well, those programs are really based on a totally misunderstanding of the brain. They, if people don't have a brain that understands the consequences of actions, wagging your finger is not going to make that part of the brain grow, yeah? If you have, if that part of your brain that doesn't really get the consequences for your actions isn't developed, finger wagging is not going to help you. Finger wagging is great for people who have really good frontal lobes. It's terrible for people who don't have a frontal lobe. So, so you need to do different things, you need to really help abused kids to learn to regulate themselves, to calm themselves down, to be in charge of themselves, uh, and the sort of programs that work for traumatized kids are athletic programs, martial arts programs, breathing programs, um, theater programs, where they learn how to interact with other kids, learn to regulate themselves in the context with other human beings and are being taught, through movement and action, how to regulate themselves in order to fit in with other people. But it's not a frontal lobe issue, it's an issue of the organism learning how to interact predictably with other human beings. Okay, let's go to what happens in trauma. And so up to now, I've given you a little bit of an impression of how the brain develops, and now I'd like to talk more about, um, how, what happens when the person is traumatized. And what you see here is a, an image that we all are familiar with, an image of what happens right after a disaster, in this case, of course, it's 9/11, of a whole bunch of people who are scrambling for their lives. And, um, when, when I saw this, I noticed that, um, something became very clear to me, and I had a, a flashback to, um, I'm skipping (ph)outside, uh, I'm going, I had a flashback to the last page of my anatomy textbook back in medical school, and thought, boy, that's interesting. This is what happens to traumatized people, eh? So here you see this picture of what happens when we become really frightened and really upset, and we've all been there, eh? When we do that, the frontal lobe of our brain shuts down. Our research shows that, I'll, I'll get back to that. And so when you're on the threat, you take leave of your senses, and you start running, and you start fighting. So a different part of your brain takes over, your animal brain, your emotional brain, it runs the show and does what we've done for millions of years, if we've, are on the threat, we start fleeing, and fighting, and bringing our, trying to preserve our lives. So what does this consist of? It consists of the animal brain doing a certain predetermined set of actions to make yourself survive. And so what it activates is circuits of running, fleeing, fighting, standing up for yourself, um, that, they're all geared towards trying to preserve your life. We run into situations like this on a fairly regular basis. When you drive on the expressway, and you're trying to make it on the expressway, and a big truck comes by, and you just slam on your brake to, in order to survive. If you see something scary, you get out of the way. If somebody starts yelling at you somewhere, you get out of the way. And so you automatically start, your body starts doing things. You don't think about it. If you had to think about it, you'd probably be dead by now. And so you, your, your body takes over, and you start doing things. And most of the time this works. What happens when you get traumatized is you start to fight back, you start to run away, you start to stop what's going on, and it fails. And when that happens, your body gets frozen in time, and your body gets stuck in that fight and flight response. It doesn't come to an end. So, this physiological arousal keeps being active in your body, and the next time that you see a guy who looks like the guy who assaulted you, or the next time somebody touches you, that reminds you of your rape, the next time you hear a sound, um, that reminds you of rockets and gunfire if you've been exposed to that, your body starts going into that fight, flight response again, you become all panicky, all anxious, because you secrete the same hormones, but the last time you didn't know what to do, and this time you still don't know what to do, so you go back into that panicky body state that is meant to make you free and, and, and liberate you, but now just puts you into a panic and in rage, et cetera, et cetera. And so that's my idea of what trauma is, about a body that gets stuck in a fight and flight response and where it hasn't come to an end, it isn't over. And so our job is, in trying to overcome trauma for ourselves and the people we work with, is to help the fight, flight response come to an end, and to say I am safe now, I'm okay, it's over. And that's not easy. And so in response to threat, people, like all animals, mobilize for automatic physical action, and as we do that, we secrete stress hormones. So there's a study by colleagues of mine at Yale who looked at the stress response of traumatized versus non-traumatized people, and they find that when they look at a, a brain hormone, uh, an adrenaline type hormone, the brain, had a, in response to the same input, traumatized people have much more secretion of that chemical that makes you feel panicky than people who are not traumatized. And so the, the brain and the body is stuck in that fear and flight response. And then the question is, how do you make that come to an end? The most, the way that people make it come to an end, ordinarily, is by having somebody else take over, yeah? And we saw that beautifully in the aftermath of 9/11. There were, uh, tens of thousands of really upset, freaked out, overwhelmed people in New York, and the world descended on New York and said, let me take care of you, and hundreds of thousands of people sent money to New York and help, many people traveled down there to help people, and that is what civilization does, a civilization makes people take care of other people. Why do we do that? Because we, is it because we are such noble people? No. We do that because we learned, in the course of evolution, that if you deal, if somebody in your community gets traumatized and you help that person to calm down, and you take, take care of that person, that person will get re-integrated in your community. And so there was something evolutionarily adaptive about altruism and taking care of other people, because we know that if, when people are filled with stress hormones that make them want to fight, and flee, and be upset, if we take care of them, and we hold them, their stress hormones will come to an end, and they'll say, I'm feeling so much better now, and they'll re-join the community. And that is really our common response to, uh, public traumas, to disasters. Whenever there's a tsunami, or an earthquake, people tend to send money or help to these areas. Um, and we have come to expect it. What, then, is striking is that there is one pop, group in the population that's exempted from that automatic generosity response, and that is people who get traumatized in their own families. Women who get brutalized by their spouses, men who get brutalized by their spouses also, children who are being abused and neglected, tend to not evoke this sort of overwhelming generosity of, let me take care of you. We see this in our current, um, climate in the United States and, uh, the end of the year 2010, and we went into these disasters, wars, all these people are going through these terrible experiences, out of Afghanistan, Iraq, and there's this outpouring of intention to help them, um, lots of programs are being set up, and the natural generosity response is, once again, taking place. Always happens after a war. Sadly, it doesn't last very long, of really reach, reaching out for people and taking care of them. Very effective. But what we forget is that there are ten times as many children who are being abused and neglected right at home in the United States. There are soldiers who have fought, eh, in Afghanistan and Iraq, and nobody is talking about that, nobody's setting up programs for that cuz there is something about intimate violence that is off that evolutionary scale of let me take care of those people. And that, of course, leads to horrendous consequences of us having more people in jail than all other civilized people combined, having high crime rates, et cetera, et cetera, because we don't take care of the kids who get hurt at home in our country. Um, so let me go onto Darwin. Um...

UNKNOWN Darwin was, Darwin lived a long time ago. He wrote his last book 140 years ago, before we knew anything about the brain. But he's a very smart guy, and he taught us some very important things, very important things for, for us as therapists to, to realize. And, uh, so at the very end of his life, Darwin, um, was a very well respected scientist, and like all scientists, he liked toys. Today we love brain images, and we love to do quantitative EEGs, in my case. Um, in the, in Darwin's time, the latest technology was photography, and boys always love to play with toys. So, in those days, people used photography to help us understand the world. So he asked people all over the globe to send him pictures of animals, and human beings, and tribespeople, and whoever, engaged in various emotional displays, and he decided to write a book about emotions call the Emotional Expressions, um, in Animal and Man. And he comes to the conclusion in this book, which you can get at your local bookstore, um, for 14.95, it's a lovely book, um, filled with pictures, and he writes, it is interesting that human beings and animals all have the same senses, emotions, intuitions, affections, and so he comes to the conclusion that our emotional life is something that we have in common with all animals. That means it's hard wired in our brain, that it, our emotions are basically much the same. They're automatic. And he illustrates this with illustrations like this, and that, he used a dog warning the postman not to get any closer, and here's the wife of his secretary telling his secretary not to come any closer. And what Darwin says, the goal of emotion is movement. Now we didn't learn that in school, that, uh, that if you go, eh, with somebody, that person moves away. If you go, the person, that moves closer. If you look like this, many people will be turned off and you move away. But if some people will say, oh, what's wrong with you that you look so disturbed? That's what Darwin points out, a very important thing, that people seem to have forgot, namely that the goal of emotions is movement and to determine our distances and closeness with people. We don't talk about it. Although Darwin says, the goal of emotion is to affect physical movement to g-, regain a state of physical equilibrium. And I take that seriously. If, so if that's the goal of emotion, maybe we should explore that. I'll get back to that. Um, and then Darwin says another thing that we, I think we all should have learned in school. Um, cuz he makes a very important discovery way before we had brain scans, knew much about the brain. He says, there's a nerve, he calls it the pneumogastric nerve, today we call it the tenth cranial nerve, or the vagus nerve. And he says, heart, guts, and brain communicate intimately via the pneumogastric nerve, the critical nerve involved in the expression and management of emotions in both humans and animals. When the mind is strongly excite, excited, it instantly affects the state of the viscera. There's Darwin, who tells us something that we know, but generally ignore, namely to have an emotion is fine. You can be angry, upset, depressed, et cetera, et cetera, and you are fine to deal with it as long as it doesn't go into your chest, into your gut, huh? So our language and every other language in the world that I've been able to get my hands on, cuz I explore these things when I travel, uh, every language has a, a, a word for gut-wrenching. Every language has a word for heart-breaking, eh, because we experience our feelings in our gut and in our chest, in the course of that pneumogastric nerve, in the course of that vagus nerve. And so what is so painful about emotions is not the fact that you're angry or sad, that's fine, they're all normal things. But when it goes into your gut, you can no longer eat, and when it goes in your chest, you can no longer breathe. Then it becomes unbearable. And when you have these unbearable physical sensations in your body, you'll start drinking, you start taking drug, you start cutting yourself, eh, because your bodies cannot feel that, cannot tolerate it. So at the end, the mo-, the unbearable thing about emotions is the physical sensations, and that means in order to work with traumatized people, with yourself, with your own emotions, all of us need to do that, you need to work with mastery in dealing with your physical sensations. And again, Darwin understood that that actually gives us a cue, a clue, because here we see the pneumogastric nerve that runs from our brainstem into our voice box, so when we get upset, you get, you can hear it through your voice. It goes into our lungs, and it goes into our heart, our heart starts pounding, and it goes into our gut. You're, when we feel bad, we feel it in the up and down in our body. So that's sort of where Darwin left it off, because that's as far as he got, and by the time we're into medical school, that's all, as far as we'd gotten also. But since that time, there has been some very important discoveries, and a discovery that I think should change the way we practice therapy, namely, in Darwin's time, and time we went to medical school shortly after that, we thought that the brain sort of runs these things into your body. Today, we know that 80 percent of the fibers of the vagus nerve are afference fibers. They run from the periphery into the brain. And that discovery should thoroughly change the way we practice therapy. Namely, what that means is that we can change the way our brain is organized via, eh, by activating the afference, the running in nerves of the vagus nerve. And that means that by breathing you can change your brain, by moving you can change your brain, by doing things with your body, you can change what your brai-, your brain feels. So that is, that understanding should liberate us to some degree of the tyranny of having to take substances in order to change the way we feel. And this gets us into, um, things that, that is (inaudible ). Hold on a second.

UNKNOWN Can we skip forward? Uh, go to the next slide that shows that, that picture of the brain up and down. Can you do that? Yeah? Okay. So, what do you do, what do you do with that? Um, this made me very interested in, in how we c-, how we can change that. So, looking around the world at, as how people have actually found ways of regulating themselves, what you find is that, in China, people have discovered certain techniques like acupuncture, and qigong, and tai chi, that's, where people move their bodies and move their breath in order to change their brain. In India, people have done, uh, de-, developed yoga, a very complex set of techniques, um, to change peoples' brains, also. In Africa, people have developed complicated dancing and movements, again, in order to change peoples' brains. So other cultures besides, uh, the northern European slash north American culture have actually, uh, developed techniques to regulate themselves. And so we get interested in that, and we get interested in something called heart rate variability. Heart rate variability is a measure of how well this part of your brain, your brain stem, can regulate arousal systems. And what we see here when we measure this is, uh, is best illustrated by a person who came into a study in our clinic who, uh, we measured his heart rate variability. So here's a 24 year old student at the local university, and we measured how his brain stem is doing, and the red here is his heart rate. And so the guy has very nice heart rate, um, and the blue here is his breath, is his breathing. And what we see is whenever he takes a breath in, his heart rate goes up, and whenever he takes a breath out, his heart rate goes down. And what you see is this nice fluctuation of his heart rate going up and down, and that's called heart rate variability. And what has been discovered is the more you have a nice fluctuation in your heart rate in response to your breath, the more healthy people are, the more contained they are, the more stress resistant they are, and so over the past decade or so, it has been discovered that having very good heart rate variability is a predictor of very good physical and emotional health. Um, and in this case, uh, this guy had experienced an, an accident in which he wrapped his car around a tree in which his b-, best friend was killed, and so we were measuring his response to that, and we are reminding him of his trauma, and what we see, remembering that incident, he becomes very upset. His breathing becomes three times as fast, it becomes very shallow as you can see here, the little shallow waves at the bottom here of his breath, and his heart becomes very irregular and much faster. But what we see is that his heart rate still, to some devee-, gree, keeps track of his breathing. So he continues to have relatively good heart rate variability in response to this trauma. And we look at that, and we think, boy, that's interesting. Um, maybe that core regulation system his, in his brain is intact. I wonder if he has PTSD. So we measure if he has PTSD. And it turns out, no, he doesn't have PTSD. He gets upset being reminded of a bad thing that happened in the past, but being upset about bad thing in the past is part of being human. Doesn't mean you have PTSD, it doesn't mean that your whole body keeps reliving and re-experiencing, uh, keeps organizing itself, um, in the same way. Um, so here's a more typical response of a, a trauma, traumatized person. And what we see here is a, originally this person, I often times see people like that in my office, and they have very rapid, very shallow breathing, and you can, when you sit with people like that, they barely seem to breathe at all, because they seem to just be up tight and hold themselves, and not really allow themselves to really f-, feel the pleasure of full breathing, and this person is also very shut down, uh, her heart rate is very slow, uh, so this is a shut down person who's just stuck in being a frightened animal, basically. And then we play back another memory of her trauma, and what you see, you see what she is afraid of, namely she is reminded of her trauma and she goes into a panic reaction, her breath goes, like that, her heart rate is out of sync, it's way up, um, but not together with the, with the breath, and then she shuts herself down, back into shallow breathing and becomes a frozen animal again. So we become interested at this point in, so, can you train a person to change this core brain stem piece? And what happens in this part, how can you tame people to do this, and, um, we were very fortunate, at this point, is I go online, and I look at what changes heart rate variability, and it turns out that, um, marathon running does so, and also there's some yoga sites that claim that yoga can do it, but they just claim it because they haven't done the work. Um, as luck would have it, some yoga teachers walked by our center around that time, happened to walk in, they said, hey, we're some yoga teachers, we're interested in trauma, um, if there's any way you, you can use us. And we said, yeah, yes we could, we, we'd love to explore yoga because, uh, learning from Darwin, and learning from the Chinese, and learning from the Indians, we think that, that yoga makes you change that core setting of the, of the brain stem and might have a good effect on peoples' psychological health. And so, um, they volunteered their time, we volunteer our time also, and we do a study comparing yoga with, uh, dialectical behavior therapy, which many people do, and we have a group of people who have been in a minimum of 12 years of off and on psychotherapy, don't seem to be doing so much better, had the typical population who you choose to go and get dialectical behavior therapy. And after eight weeks of di-, DBT group, these patients haven't really changed in terms of their PTSD, but, uh, they changed a lot after doing yoga. And so there seems to be something about learning to breathe and learning to move that seems to change peoples' core arousal system. And then we do a second study, uh, more complicated study, and that, in this study, um, we take, again, the group of people who have been chronically traumatized, um, child abuse, had early stuff, um, and have had years of psychotherapy, and they're functioning sort of, they're holding on. But they still really aren't doing v-, very well at all. And we find a control group of a group of young women at Boston University who have had no trauma, and after eight weeks of yoga, uh, the trauma, chronically traumatized people feel as healthy and as well as the Boston University students, but the Boston University students feel much better. And so we have some interesting preliminary data right now that yoga makes, makes people better, and, um, here's a, a rating scale that shows that, initially, the traumatized people feel terrible about their bodies, there's the body rating scale, and after eight weeks of yoga, they start liking their bodies and the (ph)try, the Boston University students liked their bodies for starters, but after eight weeks of yoga they liked their bodies much better. Um, and so what yoga seems to do is it changes peoples' arousal, it changes peoples' heart rate variability, it changes peoples' ownership of their bodies, and it makes people feel much less traumatized. So the, our data showed that yoga does change heart rate variability. So, um, so we learned that, uh, that yoga is one way in which people can befriend their bodies, um, regulate their bodies, become quiet, and still, and be in control. We now have an NIH grant, um, to study yoga for PTSD, and basically, our first data showed that it's a very helpful treatment. And so we're really, uh, putting the lessons from Darwin and the brain to good use right now. Um, there's some other things we learned about trauma. Um, this is a slide from a, a very famous neuroscientist, Joseph Ledoux, who came to our conference a few years ago and shows us this slide. And what Ledoux shows us is that if this round thing is the brain, a scheme of the brain, um, if the brain is threatened it hits a part of the brain called the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. So there's this little smoke detector that sits here between your ears that is sort of the smoke alarm, uh, smoke detector, alarm bell of your brain that goes off when it decides that he's threatened. It's a part of our brain we have in common with all animals, it's a very primitive part of the brain, and it's a part of, of the brain that makes decisions for us. Uh, for example, if, um, that particular sound, or smells, or taste, or people may freak me out, but you may find them very enjoyable, or certain people who you f-, who freak you out, I find very nice people, and that all depends on whether our amygdala is set to enjoy certain people and to hate other sort of people, mainly a function of early experience. But we don't control that. Um, so what Ledoux discovers is that if a person's exposed to threat, it hits the smoke detector of the brain, the smoke detector of the brain says, boy, you're in danger, and then he, what he discovers is that, if that information then travels to the part of your brain that makes your muscles move, leading to action, to doing things, what sets up is a circuit of competence, and this is something we understand very well. It's something that the US Marine Corps also understands very well, namely that being exposed to threat may be quite an interesting experience in some ways. You take these pimply, weird, disorganized adolescents in the Marine Corps and, eh, you expose them every day to a lot of stress, a lot of scary stuff, and by the time they go to bed late at night, they say, oh my god, that's amazing, I survived this, I'm an amazing person. And if that happens day, after day, after day, that you're exposed to extreme threat, and you survive it, you start feeling, I can do it, I'm an amazing person, I'm powerful. And so by the time that marines f-, finish basic training, they are a very well disciplined, very competent, very fantastic group of people. And so the Marine Corps really knows how to, to help people grow from very disorganized, unfocused people into a very organized force. And most professional trainings are like that. People go through very tough times, it's very hard on them, but they survive and by the end they say, boy, I can do it. And so that's how the brain forms that feeling of power and competence. Um, then what, what Ledoux discovers if, if this pathway gets cut off, if you cannot move, if you cannot take action, it takes a different pathway and the impulse goes to the central nucleus of the amygdala. The central nucleus of the amygdala secretes the stress hormones related with fear and terror, but it's dissociated, namely not attached to, making movements. And so if it goes that particular route, and you get exposed to something that's threatening but you cannot move, then all you do is s-, secrete stress hormones that make you feel terrified, anxious, upset, shut down, and that becomes a conditioned response that lead to a chronic sense of freezing helplessness and despondency. The implications of this are very important, namely what this shows is that traumatized people, if they can, need to learn to move in response to things that previously made them feel paralyzed. And so one of the things that I really advocate and that we do in various treatments that we are involved with is we like people to be exposed to quite scary and difficult stuff, but then to take action to make them feel competent and powerful. Like, right now, uh, we are consulting to the Japanese social welfare system, and they wanted to learn about cognitive behavioral treatment, all this stuff that's been developed in America, and I say to them, no, don't come to us, because right in your culture you have developed all this martial art stuff, and you, like, like me, you're also a crazy culture, you always, also invade other countries and think you're better than other countries, and you also get licked by other countries, just like we do, and people come home and they feel terrible, and they feel frozen and feel upset. But rather than developing cognitive treatments back there in Japan, you guys developed martial arts to help these wounded soldiers to regain a sense of power and control. And if we really take the lessons from neuroscience seriously, those are the sort of programs we need to do with traumatized people, to help them to move their bodies in a way where they couldn't move their bodies before. And so, uh, I'm a great advocate of martial arts, a program called model mugging where women are taught mindfulness skills, are taught karate to learn how to be powerful. I'm a great advocate of boxing for traumatized people, several of my traumatized women do kickboxing and do other martial arts in order to restore a sense of power and agency in their bodies. Next piece. There's another lesson from brain science. And what we learn, again, from Ledoux's animals and some other work that we and other people have done, is that, um, we have, the way the brain is built up is that we are, our brain is largely devoted to us being social creatures. We are intensely social people, we have a part, large part of our brain is d-, is, is organized around language, understanding, figuring out what other people need and want, and so the way that our brain is organized is this side part of our brain is a social part of our brain, the left brain is devoted to understanding, symbols, words, language, stuff like that. The right brain is devoted to picking up nuances in the emotional communication, way that people feel, the nuance of things, uh, so that's our brain. Um, and it turns out that, that understanding, figuring social part of our brain, unfortunately, has no access, has no power to control our emotional brain. And so the, the way that we're built up is that frontal side part of our brain is social, understanding, and words, this back part of our brain is our emotional, animal brain, still there just like an animal's. And when we get freaked out and upset, our emotional brain really runs the show. Um, and so with, what the research shows, the neuroscience research, is that you cannot understand your way out of, uh, your emotions. You cannot, eh, one of these strange therapies that's being promulgated these days is to help people to understand their irrational beliefs, and they say, oh, let's just examine how stupid it is to feel that way. I am flabbergasted by that. It ha-, has never worked with me and my kids, never worked with me and my wife, it never works with anybody, eh, trying to be rational about things. That's just not the way we're built up. Eh, like, hey, don't invade other countries, because a lot of people are going to get hurt, including all the people of who, who we send over there. No, no. We just do what we want to do because we got attacked, so we need to go kill people. Now that's our, how our emotional brain works. Um, uh, so figuring things out doesn't keep us from doing all the stupid things that we do. Um, but there is a part of the brain that can affect the emotional brain, and that part of the brain runs sort of over here. There's this middle part of your brain, which I like to call the mohawk of your brain, that starts over here and runs all the way, front to back, that has to do with our internal experience. And it turns out that our interoceptive brain, the part of our brain that pays attention to ourselves, actually can have an impact on our emotional brain. And so, um, what anybody who does trauma work sooner or later comes to the understanding is that you need to work with peoples' visceral, internal experience. And at the, at the, at the core of doing trauma work is to deal with one's visceral, core self experience. When people start, start to do trauma work, and I also started that way also, uh, they think that the trauma is something that happened a long time ago, that's out there, and you tell a story about what happened back then. As our understanding about trauma improved, what became very clear is that trauma is not what happened back then, a long time ago, because that's over. That's the past, the past is the past. What the trauma is is the imprints that that past trauma has left on our emotional brain that causes our emotional brain to continue to react as if it's not over. So the trauma is actually lodged inside of ourselves, it's inside of our visceral, core self experience. And so the core focus of trauma treatment should be to change peoples' core self experience. And that means that you need to go deep inside of peoples' own brains and build up peoples' capacity to tolerate, feel, and manage their internal sensations and feelings. So sooner or later, all of us move into mindfulness, meditation, yoga, interoceptive stuff, breathing, moving, and it's really at the core of tolerating and dealing with our traumatic experiences. So the sad and painful reality is that that part of the brain, that part of your brain that you need to really feel yourself and know yourself gets very damaged by trauma. And so research by, um, Greg Quirk and Muhammad Bilal, down the street here at Harvard, eh, shows that, that this part of the brain, this orbital frontal cortex, remember, that's the part of your brain that ma-, tells you, don't bite your mother's nipple, uh, don't do this, that part of your brain that allows you to inhibit your emotional responses, that the size of that part of your brain determines how reactive you are to unpleasant stimuli. Now let's say, let's say if you hear a car honk, or a car alarm goes off, or a fire alarm goes off, we all have a reaction to it. But the size of that reaction is determined by the size of your medial prefrontal cortex, your orbital prefrontal cortex, and the smaller that part of your brain is, the more reactive your are and the more likely you are to freak out. The sad thing is that chronically traumatized people tend to have a very small part of their brain, eh? And so they tend to be very reactive to all kind of stimuli. And when that's the case, you're rather defenseless against stuff that comes inside of you, and when somebody yells at you, uh, when you're a mature person, you have a big orbital frontal cortex, you say to yourself, hmm, that guy looks pretty freaked out, he's very upset, I wonder what's happening to him that he feels a need to yell at me? If you're a traumatized person and somebody yells at you, you say, oh my god, this person is brutalizing me, and you have a very hard time really understanding that that's his problem and not yours. So as long as you have a big observing self capacity in your head, all kind of crazy stuff happens, you say, boy, that person's having a problem, boy that person's having a bad day, but this is not about me. But if there's a very, that part of your brain is very small, it's all, becomes all about you, it goes straight into your, that part of your brain. So that leads to the next thing, in terms of trauma treatment, and that's the whole issue of neuroplasticity. Now neuroplasticity is the fairly recent understanding that we can change, to various degrees, and nobody knows at this point what degree we can do that, we can change the way that our brain reacts to the environment. And in the same way that some people go to gyms because they like having big, powerful arms, they keep lifting barbells to build up their muscles, the brain works the same way. If you do a certain action all the time with your brain, that part of your brain starts growing. So if you want to cultivate your capacity to observe, to feel yourself, and to not be affected by anything that other people are doing, and see it as their problem and not yours, you need to grow that part of the brain. And there's some interesting research coming out, again, from my colleagues here at Harvard, uh, Sarah Lazar, and that's that people who do a lot of meditation, people who do a lot of yoga, build up that part of the brain. And so, again, you can cultivate that interoceptive, introspective part the br-, brain. Not a big part of the therapy world, uh, not big if, anyb-, any of our training, but sooner or later most people who do trauma work s-, get to understand that being able to contain yourself, to mindfully observe yourself and other peoples' actions without reacting, is very central. So learning how to calm yourself down, learning how to breathe, learning how to stay focused, learning how to observe is really the foundation of all trauma treatment. (ph)Now telling the story, eh, it's good, but nobody wanted to believe you, or nobody cared to hear the story, to find somebody who's able to listen to you, willing to listen to you, help you to sort things out, all very important. But the, eh, the foundation is overcoming how all of this stuff has affected your internal life. So I'd like to actually talk about one more thing, two more things, very quickly. Um, there's a study done by a former student of mine, Ruth Lanius, in, who's now at the University of Western Ontario. Uh, she did a very important study. She did a study to see what happens in peoples' brains when they have nothing to do. It's called the default state of the brain. It's, what, what does the brain do when you don't have anywhere to go, nothing to do, you just lie there? So she puts people in the scanner, she says, just lie there and don't do anything. So this is what normal people do, um, when they lie in the scanner, and they're not thinking about other things, just laying, oh, I'm lying in the scanner, it's dark here, it's noisy, cold, ah, so they notice their own experience right there. And so what lights up is this mohawk that I talked about. At the orbital prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, that's about yourself, your self observation, and this part of the brain is called the posterior cingulate, and the posterior cingulate is the part of your brain that sort of tells you where you are, tells you where your body is, it tells you, when you start moving, where you are and where you need to go. And so a brain left to itself has this physical sense of presence and a mental sense of, I am here. Then doctor Lanius puts 18 severely traumatized Canadians in the scanner, says, just lie there, and that's what their brain looks like. Now this is really important, eh? So what happens when severely traumatized people lie in the scanner? This whole part of the brain, of me, I'm here, this is about me, disappears. So that whole sense of self has been knocked out. Uh, the other part of the brain that's knocked out, or hardly activated, is this physical sense of presence, I'm here. And this tells us something, this explains a lot to me. This explains a lot to me about how chronically traumatized people never seem to know what to do. They're always asking other people what to do. They always ask other people how to lead their lives, and, sadly, many therapists actually think that giving traumatized people advice helps them. Of course it never does, because the deficit is not in not getting enough advice, but the deficit is not having a brain that knows where it is, and a brain that is. We are currently involved in a study to see if yoga, and the postures of yoga, actually affect this part of the brain. Stay tuned, I don't know yet how it will work out. Eh, but what we're dealing with is an organism, a person, who doesn't quite know where he or she is, or where he or she is located. And so maybe at the core m-, core of trauma treatment should be to help people to, to know who they are and where they are. And there's many, probably many different ways of doing that, eh? Maybe, um, dancing may do that. I, if I had the money, I'd do, love to do a study on tango dancing and how it affects your sense of self, because that rhythm and movement with other people must give you a sense of presence, and focus, and I'm here, it helps you to concentrate on the here and now. I imagine playing tennis might help because it's a, if you don't pay attention, you miss the ball. Maybe boxing helps because if you don't pay attention, somebody's going to hit you. And so it's all about intentional systems in the brain that get knocked out by trauma. Last thing. This, to my, me, my mind, is maybe the most important study that's come out, it comes out of brain imaging. Um, it's done by a very close friend of mine in Australia. Um, a very complex setup where they take images of the brain, activity in the brain, um, and also about brain electrical activity. So what they do, something that we are very actively involved in right now, is something that they, they see what peoples' brainwaves are like. And so they put electrodes on different parts of the skull and see the activity of electro, electrical activity in the brain. And, because time is short, I'll just talk about one thing. So as you see, here's a group of 38 normal Australians, very easy to come by, they're almost all normal down there. Um, there's a group of 37 people who are severely traumatized. And what you see here is that these normal people, their brain, the different parts of their brain are working together to process a piece of information, while the traumatized people h-, the, their brains aren't really in synchrony with each other, with themselves. The different parts of the brain are not quite in sync. When I first saw this, I said, oh my god, this is even much more complicated than I thought it was, namely not only do they not focus on the outside, and they misperceive danger, and they are always frightened, but that we're now learning is that inside of traumatized peoples' brains, the different parts of the brain are not working together to process a piece of information. So what does a normal person do when they get a new piece of information into their minds, a new, how you see a new image, a new sound, how something comes in, what your brain does is all of your brain generates a wave, it's called n200, that tells you, don't pay attention to anything else, just focus on what that sound or that image is. And because you ignore everything else, because of this wave, your brain focus is very deeply on taking in what's happening, it's called a p300. A p300 is the wave that, with which your brain grabs new information and puts it into your memory. Um, so what do traumatized people do? They do not block out irrelevant information, so they don't really concentrate on what's coming in, and they don't develop a good p300. And what this means here is that you don't really grasp new information. This, this work was so important because it tells us something about what really goes on with, in traumatized brains, namely traumatized brains have a hard time taking in new information, and because they have a hard time taking in new information, they keep getting stuck in the past, they get stuck in their past fears and terrors. So maybe our most important job as therapists, somehow, is to get traumatized peoples' brains to be fully focused on what's going on right now, fully focused in the present. And there's probably many ways of doing that, again, martial arts, anything that focuses the brain, gets people deeply involved in the here and now. (ph)By do it, what we are doing, actually, is neurofeedback. We actually have people play computer games with their own brainwaves to change these waves into those waves. So, have people, there's various people have done this, and they have developed programs where you can project peoples' own brainwaves on the screen, and you can play computer games to change the way that your brain processes information. And that, in my mind, is one of the real frontiers of trauma treatment is to help to rewire the brain the way that the brain organizes what's happening in the here and now. That's all I have to say for now, um, it's complex, and it really requires some very new ways of thinking from what we all learned in school. Do you have, do you have any questions?

In that case, I hope you can take some of this in, uh, I hope you'll look at this tape, at this tape a few times so that you can really process it, talk it over. Uh, if you want to know more, you may want to visit our website, www.traumacenter.org, um, we have all sorts of information about these sort of things, and I wish you the best of luck. Thank you very much.
