THE PERSON WHO IS THE PROFESSIONAL 

00:02:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT  Professor Albee, could you tell us a bit about your family background, the important influence as a child and adolescent and if the, these influences, ah, helped you become the counselor, ah, you became later on? 

00:02:50
GEORGE ALBEE - Ph.D. Prof. Emeritus, Univ. of Vermont, Courtesy Prof. Florida Mental Health Institute, Univ. of So. Fla. 

00:02:50
GEORGE ALBEE I'll try to be brief, uhm, my mother and father were a widow and widower when they met. They had, had no children in their previous marriages. When I was born, my father was 60 years old and my mother was 40. They had, had a stillborn infant a year before me, so I was the last hope... 

00:03:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT  I see. 

00:03:25
GEORGE ALBEE ...for progeny and continuation. Well, I guess, a rarely few infants and children who had as nurturant and protective, an environment as I did. My father was retired so I spent most of my daylight hours with him as he was building a chicken coop, and, ah, doing carpentry around the house. Ah, my mother was, uhm, a storehouse of poetry and songs and so she recited and sang to me and I was an apple of both of their eyes. So I say this because it gave me an undue sense of importance. Uhm, my father died when I was six and just before the Great Depression which as you know occurred in the late '20s. So, I lived through the Great Depression where we had almost no income, uhm, and I wonder, I do not want to extend this, but one little, we lived really on venison which is deer and brook trout 'coz we live in a very wild part of Pennsylvania and they were the only proteins available. And, ah, so we had neighbors who would bring us trout and venison. About five years ago, I gave a talk at Penn State and I stayed at the Nittany Lion Inn, a very fancy inn. Uhm, on the menu, as the most expensive item, was brook trout and venison. (crosstalk) 

00:05:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And venison. (crosstalk) 

00:05:20
GEORGE ALBEE So in honor of my, ah, oppressed, ah, early childhood, I had those things to eat. Anyway, uhm, I guess, another significant early experience was at a little town in which I was born, a town of 7,000, named St. Mary's, Pennsylvania, with about 98 percent German Catholic. Because my family was Protestant, uhm, I was a member of a very seriously persecuted minority. One of the few places in America where, ah, WASP is persecuted. But I had to fight, ah, almost daily because I was not, a, a Roman Catholic and didn't go to mass. So I grew up knowing something about what it means to be a minority in, ah, America, uhm. 

00:06:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So. (crosstalk) 

00:06:15
GEORGE ALBEE  And neither my mother or father had ever graduated from eighth grade so there was very little probability that I would ever got to college but by chance, and I won't bore you with all that, I did make it to a small college in West Virginia and that opened the door, ah, to further education which eventually led to counseling and to psychology but I won't take time to go through all that. 

00:06:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Ah, be, before we move any forward, you, you mentioned, you were the only WASP, ah, ah, ah, ah, many people today, do not understand what the W.A.S.P. expression means. What do you mean by WASP? 

00:07:05
GEORGE ALBEE Oh, White Anglo-Saxon Protestant. (crosstalk) 

00:07:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Protestant, there you go. 

00:07:05
GEORGE ALBEE I was, uhm, a very rare bird in my little town. White Anglo-Saxon Protestants constituted a very small proportion of the town. So I had to fight with my neighborhood, peers and pals, all of whom were Catholic, hmm. 

00:07:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And, and for the sake of the, the, the people watching this, ah, ah, interview, okay? WASP is usually, supposed to be the majority. So they can certainly understand now, what is it that you meant, ah, by, by saying WASP and I was the minority... 

00:07:40
GEORGE ALBEE Yeah. 

00:07:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT ...in that situation, very interesting. (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
GEORGE ALBEE Okay. 

00:07:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT What other incidents led you to become the person you are today? 

00:07:45
GEORGE ALBEE  Let me try to answer with a couple of quick stories. After many adventures, I wound up as an Assistant Professor at Western Reserve University in Cleveland. And I had a joint appointment between psychology and psychiatry. And I had lunch everyday with a psychiatrist 'coz the food was better at the medical school. Uhm, one of the people at the table was a very distinguished psychiatrist who(ph) was head of the department named, Doug Bond. We had an argument one day because he couldn't figure out why he couldn't find enough residents, young psychiatrists in training to fill his residency pool. He was responsible for having residents, ah, in all the major psychiatric hospitals in the Cleveland area. He said, "Maybe it was because people didn't like Cleveland." I said, "Maybe there weren't enough residents to go around." And the argument petered out. So I went back to my office and impulsively, wrote a letter to Karl Menninger, who was head of the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, I asked him if he knew how many people were in training in psychiatry, nationally. Now(ph), he had been head of the, ah, Psychiatric Department of the Air Force and he was a number one psychiatrist in the country. A week later, unexpectedly, I got back a six-paged, double-sided, single-spaced letter from Karl Menninger. It's like hearing from the Pope or from the President. 

00:09:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I see. 

00:09:40
GEORGE ALBEE  The bottom line he said, he gave me all the details but he said, "Nobody knows how many people are in training in psychiatry or any other mental health profession." And now the bottom line, he said, "If you wanna make a contribution, find out how many people are in training in mental health." So I took the letter over to the old, hard-bitten dean of the graduate school, an old historian, and I said, "Look, Karl Menninger says I should spend my summer collecting data on what was then called, manpower." He said, "All right, how much do you want?" And I said, "Well, I have to hire a graduate student for the whole summer. So I need $60." He said, "Will you take 50?" I said, "Yeah, I'll take 50." So I went back to the department and I hired a young woman, a young black woman named Marguerite Dickey who was one of the few black graduate students. But this is back in the late '50s. And Marguerite and I spent the whole summer collecting data and we published an article in The American Psychologist, a relatively new journal in which we called, Manpower Trends in Mental Health. It was the only article that had ever been published in this subject. So I got a call asking me, from the head of the Eisenhower Commission, asking me if I wanted to write a book on mental health manpower. And I said, "Well, I've written everything there is to know on this seven-page article." He said, "Stretch it." So, I moved with my wife and infant son to Cambridge, Mass, and spent a year writing a 300-page book. I stretched our article and became the world authority on mental health manpower. There was nobody else that had written anything about this. And Marguerite Dickey and I would be invited to various meetings around the country telling people why they couldn't do what they were planning to do because there were so few psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, counselors available. Ah, so we had a very great run, where we were the experts in the field and, ah, uhm, that's one major influence but. (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT  But you, I'm sorry? 

00:12:25
GEORGE ALBEE No, go ahead. 

00:12:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Well(ph), do, do you wanna share another one 'coz you, you also, uhm, talked to me about being a Fulbright scholar in Finland and I imagined that, that was also a very influential experience. Uhm, can you share some of that experience with us? 

00:12:40
GEORGE ALBEE  Well, I've always been interested in the epidemiology of mental disorders. And, one of the very interesting things is that the northern countries, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Finland, have high rates of depression and very low rates of excitement mania. So one of the research studies I did while I was in Finland, ah, I used to lecture every Monday night to the psychiatric residents there. And we collected data and what I had heard was true. There is very little excitement mania in the northern countries but there's a lot of depression. I also, later, spent a year, ah, on a Fulbright, ah, studying in Italy where there's a lot of mania but very little depression. 

00:13:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Right. I see. 

00:13:50
GEORGE ALBEE One of the characteristics of the people in the north is that they have a very strong conscience. Wherever you have people with a lot of conscience, you tend to have a high degree of depression and suicide. So I could go on with this, but one of the things I learned in Finland is that people with a strong conscience are very trusting of other people. So that in Finland, one could, one never locks a door or locks an automobile, left everything out on a balcony to keep cool. If you took a skiing trip up through the north country in Finland, there are always state-run cabins with blankets and food and everything you needed which you could use and replace without, ah, paying for it. Uhm, everyone trusted everyone else, so there's enormous degree of difference from what I had been used to at home. Uhm, there are other differences but I learned that it's possible to have a government where there's a little or no corruption. Finland, even today, is a country with the best education and with the most, uhm, narrowing of the gap between the rich and poor. And I think that's true of many of the other northern countries as well. So that societies vary enormously in how much mutual support they have for people, for each other. I guess that's the major thing I learned in Finland. 

00:15:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT  Now, what, what led you to psychology and specifically to prevention? 

00:16:00
GEORGE ALBEE  Well, I told you about the letter from Karl Menninger. 

00:16:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
GEORGE ALBEE And then I wrote a book about the shortage of mental health people. But I kept reading and hearing about all the plans for treating people with metal and emotional disorders. Uhm, I learned in working for the Eisenhower Commission from people in the field of public health, something that I keep repeating to my students, no mass disorder of any kind has ever been eliminated by individual treatment. 

00:17:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I see. 

00:17:00
GEORGE ALBEE Well, that's a very strange concept, at least in America, where everything you read and hear about is we got to learn how to treat cancer, we'll learn how to treat stroke, we need to learn how to treat influenza. Influe, individual treatment does not reduce the rate. We have a clear-cut treatment today for gonorrhea. But there are more people with gonorrhea today than there were when penicillin was discovered. We have successful treatments for many individual diseases and we're looking for other treatments. But it's only the field of public health that knows the truth. Successful treatment does not reduce the rate. So all of us, in whatever field, including psychology, counseling, psychotherapy are gung ho eager to increase the number of people who do one-to-one treatment. They have constitutional right to do this and I'm willing to support them. If a child or friend of mine needs help, I will refer them for treatment. But it doesn't solve the problem of the society. The only way we can reduce the rate of disorder in the population is through successful prevention. Now, I went, uhm, I had a sabbatical from the University of Vermont in the mid '80s ' coz I wanted to go to a school of public health and take some courses in prevention. At great personal pain and sacrifice, I went to the University of Hawaii for a year. And left cold, snowy, wintry Vermont and lived on a little beach house in Honolulu, ah, just as a way of serving humankind. But anyway, I soaked myself for a year in public health. And, and my next incarnation, when I have a choice, I'm gonna go to a school of public health. In fact, I steered a great many of my undergraduate students who were interested in counseling or psychology into at least getting a master's degree in public health because public health is where you learn about prevention. Ah, one of the problems with prevention is that you can't make a living. Everybody in prevention is subsidized or paid for by public taxes. 

00:20:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT  I see. 

00:20:05
GEORGE ALBEE And as we know, a conservative administration and conservative professions are not eager to spend tax dollars... 

00:20:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:20:15
GEORGE ALBEE ...so it was very difficult to get funding. You can get all the money you want to study causes of cancer or causes of stroke or ways of treating with drugs but you can't get money to demonstrate that poverty is a major cause of mental disorder. 

00:20:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT That, that, that helped me to understand now, 'coz you have two major themes in your publications and your writing. One, is the idea that prevention is the real way to go in terms of solving societal problems. Individual treatment does not accomplish that. And the second one, is an emphasis in today's society for medicalization and one-on-one treatment and the idea that the brain or some physical dysfunction is a culprit or the responsible for the disorder, when in fact, social factors can be more important. Did I understand the, your, your. (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
GEORGE ALBEE Yeah, what I meant(ph) to say that there was a, an abrupt change in 1980 in the causes attributing to the increase in mental and emotional disorders. That's always been a slippery area but under the Carter Administration and under the National Mental Health Program he established, it was generally agreed that a major cause of emotional distress was poverty. Poverty was at the root of most emotional problem, the stress of poverty. With the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, a wall came down. The National Institute of Mental Health was told, "We will have no more research on the social causes of mental disorder. From now on, we're only going to support research into the chemical, biological, organic causes." And that was actually in a memo from the White House. I don't think Reagan wrote it but thru the National Institute of Mental health. So there was a sudden sea change, there was a sudden, ah, dramatic change in what was attributed to be the causes of mental disorder. I have to tell you that conservatives, as a general rule, are opposed to prevention, partly because this means social change. Ah, they are very much in favor of an organic explanation because if I tell you, the gap between the rich and poor is a major measure of the amount of mental and emotional disorder in a society so if we wanna reduce the rate, we even up this gap. And as a psychologist, a man named Wilkinson, who has demonstrated this beautifully in a book, the gap determines how much depression, how much early death, how much poor health exists in a society. Well, if you tell a government like Maggie Thatcher's or Ronald Reagan's, that we got to narrow the gap between the rich and poor, that's gonna be very damaging to the profits of the wealthy. 

00:24:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Oh, I see. 

00:24:10
GEORGE ALBEE - Ph.D. Prof. Emeritus, Univ. of Vermont, Courtesy Prof. Florida Mental Health Institute, Univ. of So. Fla. 

00:24:10
GEORGE ALBEE If on the other hand, you say, well, we now know, that all mental illnesses is due to a brain disease, well, we can appropriate a little money to study brain disease. But it doesn't cost anything like what it would cost to reduce the gap to bring the poor up and to limit the very wealthy. So, the two explanations, the social injustice explanation and the brain disease explanation really divide conservatives and liberals. Right now, uhm, and for the last 25 years, our National Institute of Mental Health has had directors who have insisted on spending all the research money on looking at brain disease. Now, everyone agrees that we have at least 40 million, 40 million people in our society with diagnosable mental disorders. Am I mistaken or do you agree with me that we can't have 40 million people that have brain disease in our society? Uh, if it's genetic, pretty soon everybody's gonna have brain disease. Uhm. 

00:25:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I see. 

00:25:40
GEORGE ALBEE But it's very profitable for the pharmaceutical corporations. They make more money, more profit than any other single category. So we constantly read in our major medical journals like Newsweek and Time and other periodical, that a new drug has been discovered that reduces depression. Now, it's very useful for the pharmaceutical companies... (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Hmm. 

00:26:10
GEORGE ALBEE To find a, uhm, a famous person with the disorder 'coz then they could stand that person up and say, "I, I recovered because I took this drug." And you bring them to meetings and, ah, you stand up, uhm, ah, Mike Wallace, who was a sort of poster boy for depression. 

00:26:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Right. For an anti-depressant. 

00:26:35
GEORGE ALBEE  Or the guy at Princeton who got the Nobel Prize because he was "schizophrenic." 

00:26:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT  I see. 

00:26:45
GEORGE ALBEE And everybody accepts the organic model because you got this poster child in them(ph). 

00:26:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT What do you consider your major contributions to the field of prevention? 

00:27:00
[sil.] 

00:27:00
GEORGE ALBEE  Well, in the early 1970s, I taught a summer course at Harvard. I was a visiting professor. And it was called the social origins of psychopathology. And those were back in those glorious days when people were really into social change. One of the young women in my class said, "I want you to talk to my father." And I said, "Oh, okay." He and his wife drove up to Vermont. He said to me, uhm, "My daughter tells me that you have some ideas about how to reduce mental disorders in children." I said, "Yes, I do." He said, "I'd like to give some money to someone who is going to do a research study that reduces the rate in children. Do you have someone to recommend?" I said, "I have another suggestion for you." I said, "Why don't you give some money to us to have a national conference on prevention?" And he said, "Well, how much would that cost?" I hadn't the faintest idea and, ah, I said, "I would estimate $25,000." He pulled a checkbook out of his pocket and he wrote me a check. 

00:28:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT For 25,000? (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
GEORGE ALBEE For $25,000. He said... (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:28:40
GEORGE ALBEE "Have the conference." Well, we had the conference. And we had 300 people come from all over the country who were really interested in the prevention of mental disorder. This industrialist and his wife from the Boston area attended and they were lionized, I mean, they were carried around on people's shoulders for making this great conference possible. Then we published a book based on the papers of that conference. And so, he called me about two weeks later and he said, "What are we gonna do next year?" And I said, "Well, we're gonna have another conference if you're willing?" And he said, "Okay, how much would this one cost?" And I said, "Well, we spent the 25,000 you gave us but we will make up the balance. It costs us another 10,000 but we'll get royalties from the book." "You know, I'll send you a check for 35,000." 

00:29:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:29:45
GEORGE ALBEE Anyway, that was the beginning of 17 books that were based on 17 conferences. He dropped out after the sixth conference. He and his wife were very straight-laced, proper, uhm, up-tight middle- class WASPs, White Anglo-Saxon Protestants. Our sixth conference was on re, reducing and preventing sexual problems. So we had the Boston Women's Health Group who wrote, Our Bodies Ourselves. They were a very left-wing women's group. And we had a young man who was one of the leaders in the Gay Rights Movement. And we had Betty Friedan who was the great beginner, one of the beginners of the Women's Movement. Uhm, we had a number of other fairly radical people. Our angels who gave us money, left in the middle of the meeting with other demands on their time and stopped giving us money. It was just too rich for their blood to have, uhm, all these public talk about gays and lesbians and freedom and women's rights. But by this time, we had six books in print and had enough money. And we can have another conference. We also had one secret buried spy in the National Institute of Mental Health, a wonderful guy named Steve Rolston(ph) who now lives in Israel. But you see, you can actually get a grant from NIMH without competing if the grant was under 25,000. So each year, we applied for 24,500 for another conference. (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Okay. 

00:31:55
GEORGE ALBEE And we often we got it. That's a perfect or legitimate honest competition but we managed to have 17, ah, conferences on prevention. And those books, I guess are probably the proudest thing I own. I still have a bunch of them at home and, ah, on a shelf but they got distributed everywhere... (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT (inaudible ). 

00:32:18
GEORGE ALBEE ...including abroad, including libraries overseas and, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah. 

00:32:20
GEORGE ALBEE so they started this whole prevention revolution. 

00:32:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I see. Now, you, you, you mention, ah, the, the benefactor stepping out of the conference after, after the sixth conference, uhm, so I imagined that you, you have faced many challenges in becoming the person you are. Who, which are, are, are the, the most salient challenges that you have faced in your life? 

00:32:45
GEORGE ALBEE Uhm, well, I've had the good luck of having the support of very strong people in my own field... (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:32:55
GEORGE ALBEE ...and in related fields. Uhm, my late first wife was the oldest daughter of Sicilian immigrants borne on a fifth floor walk up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Uhm, she went to the Henry Street Settlement which is a famous landmark for poor people on the Lower East Side. She was quasi-adopted by a couple of Jewish women social workers and unlike almost any other Sicilian daughter, she was encouraged to finish high school and then go to college. And she went to Brooklyn College. And she took courses with Abe Maslow, a very well known humanistic psychologist. (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:33:50
GEORGE ALBEE At the same time that Emory(ph), uhm, Emory Collins(ph), I'm sure they were in the same class. They didn't know each other. They were both from Brooklyn by that time. Uhm, through a series of circumstances, she wound up as head of the child guidance place in Pittsburgh. She was a social group worker, got her master's in group work in Pittsburgh. Ben Spock and a couple of other, wise men from the east, as they were called, came to Pittsburgh, for she and Ben Spock became good friends. So I met Spock through her. A few years later, I was walking through the Baltimore airport and I bumped into Ben Spock. And we sat, he said, "By the way, George," he said to me, "I'm, I'm looking for a job. You have any ideas where I might find a job?" This is the most famous pediatrician in the world asking me if I knew where he could find a job. I immediately got back to Cleveland and I called Doug Bond, the guy who started my career and who got me to wrote to Menninger, he was still head of psychiatry but now, he was dean of the medical school and I said, "Doug, you won't believe this, but Ben Spock is looking for a job." He said, "What's his number?" So he called him, and Spock came to Western Reserve. They asked him how much he wanted, I thought it would be millions, he said, "I'll take an office, a secretary and $5,000 a year." (crosstalk) 

00:35:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:35:45
GEORGE ALBEE  That was a bargain for Doug Bond... (crosstalk) 

00:35:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Right. 

00:35:50
GEORGE ALBEE ...the dean of the medical school because by this time, Spock had sold millions and millions of copies. And he also wrote regularly for magazines. He had more income. He lived about two blocks from me and we became friends. But he was a very anti- war activist and he and I used to march in Cleveland against the Board of Education, which was trying to avoid integration, and was trying to build more schools in the Black inner-city rather than integrating the schools. And so Spock, taught me a lot of, I mean, he was always at the front of the line carrying a sign and I was behind him or with him, but I learned that if you wear a collar, necktie, and a suit, the police never hit you. The police beat up... (crosstalk) 

00:36:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT  Everybody else, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
GEORGE ALBEE ...other people on the picket line... (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:37:00
GEORGE ALBEE ...but Spock and I, (laughs) I'm wearing my tie and my shirt. (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:37:05
GEORGE ALBEE We didn't ever get beat up. We got arrested, but we never gotten beat up. Anyway, he was another major influence because he was so determined to seek justice and to stop the Vietnam War and so on. So, I got a lot of courage from him back in the '70s, when the American Psychological Association was meeting in Washington. I, I was asked by and agreed for, a group called the Psychologist for Social Action... (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:37:45
GEORGE ALBEE ...to lead a march down Connecticut Avenue through the White House to protest the Vietnam War. (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Hmm. 

00:37:50
GEORGE ALBEE  And so in Lafayette Park, which is across the street from the White House, the two speakers against the war were, I.F. Stone, you, young people don't know I.F. Stone, but Izzy Stone was a great Liberal who wrote for left-wing magazines like, "The Nation" Izzy Stone and I were the two speakers and, uhm, I'm, probably more, uhm, FBI agents than members of the crowd were around and I have my picture taken by probably a hundred different, ah, FBI agents and I keep saying I'm gonna write and see if I can get my, ah, pictures from those days so I can circulate them to my grandchildren. I'm not sure I've answered your question, but Ben Spock, uhm, was a very important. (crosstalk) 

00:38:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Important, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:38:50
GEORGE ALBEE All of these things occurred by chance. Uhm, my argument with Bond, my long letter from Menninger where he set me into looking for the numbers of people available, my growing interest in public health, my anti-establishment views as a consequence of knowing Spock and his group was called Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. Uhm, all of those things blended together. 

00:39:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT What else do you think is important for us to know about your personal history at this point? 

00:39:30
GEORGE ALBEE  Well, when I was inducted into the Air Force, I was sent to, ah, tarpaper barracks in Madison, Wisconsin to learn to fix radios. I was a Psych major, so, logically, they sent me to radio school. There were 300 in my class and I was one of the top 10. And then I figured out if I'm gonna have to study it, I would study it. And the other nine young men in my class were all Jewish young men from New York. The 10 of us were chosen to go to Illinois, to electronics school. Once again, we became the top 10 in our class. By this time, we knew each other quite well and they equally adopted this dumb WASP from a small town in Pennsylvania. We were sent to a place you may have heard of, called the Boca Raton Air Force Base... (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh-huh. 

00:40:45
GEORGE ALBEE  where we went through radar school. The same 10 became instructors in the new radar school that was being established in the Boca Raton Country Club. That was a number of years before I ever admitted that I spent most of World War II in the... (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT You worked... (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
GEORGE ALBEE ...Boca Raton Country Club... (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT (inaudible ) 

00:41:13
GEORGE ALBEE ...teaching radar. But my buddies, by this time, we were all very close, made me an honorary Jew. I joined the Young Men's Hebrew Association in Miami Beach. Every Sunday, every weekend, we went to Miami Beach and on Saturday, we, uhm, fraternized with the Jewish young women from New York who came down for a two-week vacation. And every Sunday, we went to the YMHA for lox and bagels and, uhm, I learned to speak a fair amount of Yiddish, not as much as Colin Powell. You may know that Colin Powell who worked in, uhm, children's store and, uhm, I guess it was Queens, for a Jewish elderly couple, learned to be fluent. 

00:42:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Oh, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:42:15
GEORGE ALBEE And one of the interesting things, one has, uhm, Chief of Staff of, I mean, ah, chi, Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff, he went to Israel. He was having a meeting with Yitzhak Rabin, who was then Premier of Israel and they were struggling with English, so Colin Powell said, "Look, if it's easier for you, we can speak Yiddish." Then Rabin didn't believe that this great American general was fluent. 

00:42:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT  And we... (crosstalk) 

00:42:50
GEORGE ALBEE So, I will say here, in answer to your question, uhm, my first wife, late first wife, being Sicilian, I learned a great deal about the history of immigration in the Lower East side. Uhm, after she died of Alzheimer's, I married my present wife, who is Cantonese, born and raised in Hong Kong. So I've been as a, small town WASP, uhm, with a limited education, culturally, I've been exposed to the great Sicilian society, during the war to the great Jewish society, and now, currently, for a whole extended Cantonese family. So, part of my education has been a consequence of my contact with... (crosstalk) 

00:43:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT All right. 

00:43:55
GEORGE ALBEE ...groups that I would never have met except for all these chance events that have occurred. 

00:44:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Chance events. Thank you. 

00:44:00
PREVENTION DEFINED 

00:44:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT  Tell us about prevention and what it means to you. 

00:44:20
GEORGE ALBEE  If our goal is to reduce the rate of mental and emotional disorders in the population, then individual treatment is not gonna accomplish that because we know from the experience in the field of public health that only effective primary prevention reduces the rate. So, I would argue that it's important for our students to at least be exposed to the benefits of prevention. 

00:45:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:45:10
GEORGE ALBEE I'm gonna say primary prevention. I'll explain that later, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:45:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:45:15
GEORGE ALBEE  If our goal is to reduce the rate in the population then, so, uhm, I would say that my major purpose professionally has been to try to increase our knowledge and understanding of prevention. 

00:45:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I see. Now, my students usually get confused with the idea of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. Will you please define them for us? 

00:45:45
GEORGE ALBEE - Ph.D. Prof. Emeritus, Univ. of Vermont, Courtesy Prof. Florida Mental Health Institute, Univ. of So. Fla. 

00:45:45
GEORGE ALBEE  Well, Gerald Caplan, the godfather of preventive psychiatry, hoping to clarify the field of prevention, I think, confused us by using these three terms as prevention. Primary prevention means taking action now so that unfortunate things don't happen later. We vaccinate our children today against mumps and measles, so they never catch mumps and measles. We put chemicals in the drinking water, so that the people in the population never, are exposed to cholera. 

00:46:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:46:45
GEORGE ALBEE That's primary prevention, doing something now, so that unfortunate things don't happen in the future. Ah, Caplan said, "Well, we also have to think about secondary prevention." When a person begins to show signs of illness or maladjustment, we should rush in and keep it from getting worse and that, essentially, is secondary prevention and it's perfectly good in medicine. You know, if somebody has, ah, the beginnings of the flu... (crosstalk) 

00:47:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah. 

00:47:30
GEORGE ALBEE ...we give them medication to keep it from getting worse, but it is an individual treatment. We're only dealing with one person. Tertiary prevention, the third category is, after the damage has been done, let's make life as easy as possible for that person. Well, this is really rehabilitation. If a person in Vietnam or in, ah, Iraq loses a limb, let's do the best that we can to heal that wound and let's give that person an artificial limb to minimize the damage. Now that's generally called tertiary. (crosstalk) 

00:48:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Tertiary. 

00:48:25
GEORGE ALBEE In the Caplan mode, it's called tertiary prevention. When I talk about prevention, I'm really only interested in talking, for strategic reasons, about primary prevention... (crosstalk) 

00:48:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT  Oh, I see. 

00:48:40
GEORGE ALBEE ...about preventing something unfortunate that will happen to groups of people in the future. 

00:48:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And, and I can see that your emphasis is not on the individual, but is on the group. 

00:48:50
GEORGE ALBEE Right. 

00:48:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Now, let me ask you this then. What do you think about individual counseling and psychotherapy? 

00:48:55
GEORGE ALBEE  Uhm, I have no objection to individual counseling and psychotherapy. As I say, some of my best friends are counselors and psychotherapists. 

00:49:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:49:10
GEORGE ALBEE  If a child or a grandchild of mine needs help, I will try to see that they get good counseling or psychotherapy. 

00:49:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:49:25
GEORGE ALBEE However, if this concern is about the strategy for reducing the rate in the population, then individual therapy of whatever kind, whether it's brain surgery or heart surgery or whatever, while it's beneficial to the individual, does not change the rate in the population. (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yes. I see. 

00:49:50
GEORGE ALBEE  That's, I'll say one more... 

00:49:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh-huh. 

00:49:55
GEORGE ALBEE ...I think, important thing. The fact that individual counseling and/or psychotherapy often relieves the person, eliminates the problem, is successful, this establishes that the condition is not an organic brain disease. Individual therapy of the brain does not get rid of mental disorders. But if we treat a person with a phobia through counseling and we get rid of the phobia, very common success then this means that the phobia cannot be due to some kind of brain damage. So, one of the effective goals of counseling and psychotherapy is a clear-cut establishment of the learning origins of many mental disorders. Many years ago, a very distinguished woman psychologist, Marie Jahoda, a social psychologist, explained to me that almost all mental disorders are learned. 

00:51:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:51:30
GEORGE ALBEE If they are learned, as she said, they can be unlearned. If they can be unlearned, then they cannot be organic. 

00:51:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:51:40
GEORGE ALBEE Uhm, Marie died recently in London at the age of 93, but she was another of the great contributors to the theory of prevention. 

00:51:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I see. Now, let me ask you. Why is it that prevention does not get enough attention, being as it is one of the best possibilities to really reduce, you know, the po, the mental disorders? 

00:52:10
GEORGE ALBEE Why. 

00:52:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Why is it, does it, it does not get enough attention? 

00:52:10
GEORGE ALBEE  Well, one, as I said earlier, all prevention is paid for by taxes. Prevention is not something that the drug companies care to endorse. Prevention is not something that the National Institute of Mental Health has much interest in. Everything in our society is focused on treatment. 

00:52:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:52:35
GEORGE ALBEE  Uhm, also prevention, in one way or another, often means social change. It means getting more social justice, eliminating discrimination, eliminating bad housing, eliminating poverty. 

00:52:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:52:55
GEORGE ALBEE All of these are, ah, prevention strategies, but they cost tax dollars and so, ah, and they are not popular. 

00:53:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Right. 

00:53:10
[sil.] 

00:53:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT  Professor Albee, you mentioned the idea of social justice. What led you to an awareness of multicultural issues and social justice? 

00:53:30
GEORGE ALBEE - Ph.D. Prof. Emeritus, Univ. of Vermont, Courtesy Prof. Florida Mental Health Institute, Univ. of So. Fla. 

00:53:30
GEORGE ALBEE  Well, without repeating myself at any length, I think growing up as a member of a minority group in a strange way, in a town where my, ah, particular group was a very small minority. It made me highly sensitive to how minorities are often, uhm, dealt with badly. Uhm, I think my long exposure to culture is very different from my own... 

00:54:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:54:05
GEORGE ALBEE  to the Sicilian culture, for example, to the Jewish culture, uhm, to the Chinese culture, has at least, raised my awareness of how there are very different styles of living and very different sets of values from, ah, the ones that I learned early. Uhm, I think also, spending a lot of time in other cultures, I lived for a year in Finland. I lived for a year at the University of Rome in Rome. Uhm, I lived a long series of exposures in Hong Kong. I lived for a year in Hawaii. Ah, in all of those experiences I had, intense, uhm, exposure to other cultures. For the last several years, I've been going two or three times a year to Scotland, where I have a, kind of friendly arrangement with the university, uhm, that has a very significant program in community psychology. Well, I think, being exposed to all of these different worlds has been a major force, major help. 

00:55:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT  Ah, you, you also mentioned working with, ah, professionals who work from a different ethnic and, and cultural background than yours. Ah, what, what challenges did you meet, you know, in becoming a multicultural and a social justice advocate in a sense? 

00:55:55
[sil.] 

00:55:55
GEORGE ALBEE  One of the few advantages of living a long time... 

00:56:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:56:05
GEORGE ALBEE ...is that you tend to go through periods of very different exposure. Beginning way back in 1950, I worked for the American Psychological Association. It was a very racist group located in Washington. It was very largely composed of college professors. However, in those days, almost all college professors were White, almost all of them were Protestant, almost all of them were politically conservative and I worked with a very admirable guy named Fillmore Sanford, who was head of the Washington office. 

00:57:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

00:57:05
GEORGE ALBEE He was really the first to hire people outside that narrow track. Uhm, we used to advertise in the American Psychologist, uhm, ah, "Young Assistant Professor Wanted, must be White, Protestant and able to lead chapel services." Fillmore abolished such ads. He said, "We'll only advertise jobs. We won't advertise religious or other qualifications." Uhm, we refused an invitation to take the convention to Miami Beach. He and I flew down to Miami Beach and, ah, asked the head of the convention bureau whether our Black members would be welcomed. He said, "Oh, of course, they'll be welcome, ah, we'll have a special hotel where they can stay and, ah." Well, it was Fillmore really who said, "We won't bring our association to Miami until every one of our members feels comfortable." At the same time, the registration form at the convention said, "Member's name. Wife's name." Ah, we weren't even conscious how sexist this was because 30 percent of the members of our association where women. So, why should we write, "Member's name. Wife's name?" Why not, "Spouse's name. Member's name. Spouse's name?" 

00:58:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT  Exactly(ph). 

00:59:00
GEORGE ALBEE So, uhm, it took the Association for Women in Psychology and the Black Psychological Association, ah, in 1969-70, to get APA to change its bylaws. One of the fortunate things was that the president of APA following me was Kenneth B. Clark, Kenneth Bancroft Clark, a distinguished Black psychologist, who testified in the Brown versus the Board of Education case, uhm, who opened the eyes of the Board of Directors of APA through all of the racist and sexist things that we weren't consciously aware of. 

00:59:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah. 

00:59:55
GEORGE ALBEE So, I think both of this, these kinds of experience had a major effect. 

01:00:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT  What advice will you have for a young professional coming up in the field to become very sort of aware about multicultural and social justice issues? 

01:00:15
GEORGE ALBEE Well, for one thing, to know something about other cultures. 

01:00:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

01:00:20
GEORGE ALBEE  Uhm, another thing would be to learn other languages. Uhm, Stuart Cook, a very distinguished social psychologist showed that inter-group relations benefit where you have equal, you have contact between equals. Ah, but as long as the relationship is not an up-and-down relationship, but is a relationship between equals, you have a much more hopeful intercultural outcome. So, I would say, putting young people together in the student groups from different backgrounds is a major factor. For a very, very long time in psychology, there was a strict prejudice against women graduate students and against Black graduate students. For the ten most prestigious graduate schools in the country that produce 3,000 PhDs, this is up until about 1960, there are only eight Black PhDs. There were very few women, some of the most distinguished universities, Ivy League Schools, had a policy of taking one woman a year and might take 25 graduate students, but you know, we will always take one woman. 

01:02:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

01:02:10
GEORGE ALBEE So I think, uhm, we've made a lot of progress since that time, but I think having students where multicultural backgrounds interact with each other, has all kinds of hidden benefits. 

01:02:25
VIEWS OF THE FIELD AND SUCCESSFUL PREVENTION PROGRAMS 

01:02:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT  What's your view of the current status of psychological education, training, and research? 

01:02:45
GEORGE ALBEE - Ph.D. Prof. Emeritus, Univ. of Vermont, 

01:02:45
Courtesy Prof. Florida Mental Health Institute, Univ. of So. Fla. 

01:02:45
GEORGE ALBEE  I'm very unhappy with the movement of training in psychology at least. Out of the established universities and into storefront organizations where there is no permanent faculty, just part-time faculty, uhm, there is no, ah, major library. There are no parallel groups in philosophy or biology, but there are simply places to train people to be practitioners. I think there's been too rapid a movement toward elevating practice at the expense of science and scholarship, so I'm very miserable with the present status of training. Uhm, I don't see any way to reverse this because in psychology at least now, more than half of all doctoral students are in Psy.D. Programs, some of which are better than others, but many of which are simply ways of training a person to be a pure counselor, pure psychotherapist, uhm, pure assessment person without any broad background in the field, so I'm, uhm, ah, concerned at the diminution of the quality of training. 

01:04:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And, and my impression is that you see this as an ongoing trend, not one that will change anytime soon. So, let me ask you for the future of the profession. Where do you see the psychology profession going in the next 20 years? 

01:04:45
GEORGE ALBEE Oh, I'm very pessimistic that we will succeed in earning, state by state, the right to prescribe drugs, which I think is strictly an economic issue because you can't make a living anymore getting paid for counseling and psychotherapy, but you can get paid for giving prescriptions. This is the way it's all going to go, since I don't believe that most mental disorders have a biological base, but they are learned and the way to unlearn them is through effective therapy counseling. I'm very pessimistic about the future. 

01:05:25
SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION 

01:05:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT  Professor Albee, you have made several contributions to our field. However, let me ask you, is there a particular one that you consider your gift to the psychology profession? 

01:05:50
GEORGE ALBEE - Ph.D. Prof. Emeritus, Univ. of Vermont, Courtesy Prof. Florida Mental Health Institute, Univ. of So. Fla. 

01:05:50
GEORGE ALBEE  I have become aware and I've tried to make my students aware of how much of the things we do is politically determined or politically influenced. I've been concerned that so many of our students come into our field with little knowledge or interest in the social, political, economic, uhm, factors that influence what we do and how we do it. Uhm, I'm concerned that our educational programs don't emphasize ethical and social underpinnings. Uhm, we've talked some about multicultural counseling. 

01:07:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

01:07:00
GEORGE ALBEE I remember at the Vail Conference, uhm, Allen Ivey and Joe White and I drafted a recommendation that people shouldn't try to counsel people from different cultural backgrounds. That really was unethical, uhm, to try to change people whose culture we're unfamiliar with. So, I've tried to make sure that my students are culturally sophisticated and know something about the people they are working with. I guess I have to say one other thing. I'm very concerned about the fact that so much of what our modern corporations do, they do without a conscience. We seemed to be focused on the importance of profit and we're quite willing to sacrifice people, uhm, in the interest of increasing profit. And I think our graduate students and our students in general ought to be, ah, aware of economic and political factors. So, this is a fairly abstract answer to your question, but I do think we need broader education about culture and about social issues. 

01:08:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT  And I can see you that you have been relentless in keeping us abreast of that position of yours because every time that I turn around, I can you speaking about the importance of considering those two variables, political and socio-economical factors. And you also mentioned that most of what we do in prevention is not a money-making enterprise. So let me ask you this, in concluding our interview today, can you give us a couple of good examples of successful prevention programs that will illustrate to the world what can be done in this field? 

01:09:10
GEORGE ALBEE You know, the question you just asked is one that was raised in a National Prevention Group about ten years ago, "What's the best prevention program we could have?" So, the group of us maybe, seven or eight, sat around all afternoon and we came up with an answer to your question. 

01:09:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh hmm. 

01:09:35
GEORGE ALBEE What is the best possible prevention program? The answer is if every child born was a wanted child, this will reduce the rate of emotional disorder in the population. Now, we can go on and talk about, uhm, oh, Henry David's work on unwanted children. He has studied them in Czechoslovakia, Czech Republic, Sweden. Unwanted children have a very, very negative prospect. Wanted children have a very positive. Now, this means that children should be hopefully planned for rather than discovered. Uhm, many of our foreign aid programs in this country are against planning and against controlling, uhm, the outcome, reproductive outcome. So, I think it's very important that we try to support those programs where we encourage wanted children. Wanted children are much more likely to be full term. Wanted children are much more likely to be breastfed. Wanted children are much more likely to fed in general. So, if you want an answer, (crosstalk) 

01:11:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Right. 

01:11:15
GEORGE ALBEE simple answer to one question about prevention, let's take whatever steps we can to be sure that every child is a wanted child.
