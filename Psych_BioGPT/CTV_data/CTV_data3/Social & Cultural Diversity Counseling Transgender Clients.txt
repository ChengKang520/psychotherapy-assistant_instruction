SHANNON DERMER Welcome. My name is Shannon Dermer and I am the Chair of the division of Psychology and Counseling at Governor's State University. I am here with Dr. Christienne Dyslin today and we are going to be discussing transgender issues and counseling. I am going to have Dr. Dyslin introduce herself in just a moment and then we will discuss some of those issues followed by a brief interview and then we will discuss some other issues at the end. But first, let's start with the star of the show Dr. Dyslin. 

00:00:50
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Hi. 

00:00:50
SHANNON DERMER Hi. Could you tell us a little bit about yourself? 

00:00:55

Associate Professor, Governors State University

Division of Psychology and Counseling 

00:00:55
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Sure. I am a clinical psychologist by training and by licensure and also member of the psychology faculty here at Governor's State University. I am also a transgender woman and so I have personal awareness with this topic as well as professional awareness. 

00:01:15
SHANNON DERMER Well great I want to thank you for joining me today to discuss some of these issues and I know we are not going to be discussing like the specialisation of working with gender issues or transgender clients. It is more some basics how the, you know, the typical counselling trainee or counsellor out there can work with gender issues or transgender clients, where the families of transgender clients in a respectful knowledgeable way. 

00:01:45
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Yeah, I think to that, you know, there will be many circumstances where there are clearly gender clinics available and specialists available, but there will be many, many circumstances especially for people in rural areas etc. where they may not have access to that and many people for financial reasons might have access to a community mental health centre that has someone that specialises. 

00:02:10
SHANNON DERMER Good point. 

00:02:10
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN I wanted to start out by pointing out what I think is the most important or central sort of aspect of this which is to say that this is a very vulnerable population. Quite marginalised and very vulnerable and one clear piece of evidence for that is the suicide rates, suicide attempt rates among transgender persons. So, if you think about the general population that rate is about 9% lifetime attempts at suicide among Trans persons that's 41%. 

00:02:45
SHANNON DERMER Wow. 

00:02:45
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN And umm… that even is much higher than lesbian and gay persons who have showed rates around you know10 to 20 percent. And then it jumps even higher which I think is the most important thing for practitioners to think about to be aware of when maybe working with clients. Transgender persons who have been rejected by a health service provider. Have a 60% rate of attempt of suicide rate in their lifetime. This is according to the Williams Institute at UCLA. 

00:03:25
SHANNON DERMER So, over half of the transgender community who if they have well 40 a little over 40 percent you said of the transgender community have attempted suicide. But that shows the importance of some sensitivity and acceptance from the mental health field that it shows that it jumps much higher. 

00:03:40
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Yes. 

00:03:45
SHANNON DERMER If people feel rejected from a mental health professional. 

00:03:45
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Yes. 

00:03:45
SHANNON DERMER So what do they, I am sure they expect to be supportive and 

00:03:50
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN A helper. 

00:03:50
SHANNON DERMER Sensitive and a helper and so then that's even more sounds like devastating if they are not sensitive. 

00:03:55
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Absolutely. 

00:03:55
SHANNON DERMER Okay, good. So, what, you know, we only have about 20 minutes to talk about some of the basic things. So, what are some of the key points that you think are important for just the general counselling trainee to know. 

00:04:10
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Okay. I think that we probably have to start just at the really basics stuff which is differentiating sex and gender. People will often talk about biological sex and what they tend to mean is something that is assigned at birth. Usually, by a physician usually based on visuals of the gentile area, but it is also related to a person's hormones and their reproductive organs and their chromosomes etc. But when we talk about gender and gender identity in particular what we are talking about is a person's self-awareness. Their understanding of themselves, I think that most people can relate to just waking up and just looking on a mirror and the person that they see looking back at them fits with their internal sort of image and recognition of their self. For, some Trans people that is really not the case. 

00:05:10
SHANNON DERMER I find that that is a really, even though you just said it beautifully, but I think that that's when I worked with supervisees and trainees and students, that they really struggle with that idea and not just give a quick example, because I am not an expert in gender issues, but I do teach a sex therapy class and we were going over gender identity and affectional orientation and things like that and there was a student who was just very honest and he said I just I don't get it. I don't get how you could feel like you are in, like your body doesn't match who you feel and things like that and he was, you know, kind of masculine guy and I said to him, you know, if there was a tragic tractor accident and you no longer have the gentile area that, you know, we identify people with at birth and assign their gender. And I said if we grew out your hair and we put a dress on you and things like would you then be a woman? He is like no I would still be a guy and I am like exactly even though your outside wouldn't be matching, what, you know, you are on the inside. 

00:06:20
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Right, what a great example and it also sort of reflects, you know, another basic concept which is the notion of gender expression. How a person offers their gender to people around them? So, gender expression can be voice, mannerisms, clothing, hairstyles, some of the things that you mentioned. So, sometimes gender expression doesn't match biological sex and sometimes gender identity doesn't match biological sex and sometimes neither matches biological sex. When there is a mismatch this way, then we would say that a person is transgender, which is kind of an umbrella term. And I will break down some basics of different ways of being transgender or Trans for short and then there is a term that's gone about that's called cisgender and usually only hear transgender people say this, but they say a person is Cisgender or Cis. Which just means that gender identity or gender expression are line up with assigned at birth biological sex. 

00:07:35
SHANNON DERMER Yes, a lot of times we only assign gender orientation or gender identity or sexual orientation or affection orientation if it doesn't match the majority. 

00:07:45
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Right. 

00:07:45
SHANNON DERMER So, you know, if you don't say anything it's assumed that you are cisgender so we never hear that term and if you don't say anything it is assumed that you a heterosexual. So, we only label people who are different from the norm. But they are actually is the term cisgender for when you are… 

00:08:00
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Not transgender. 

00:08:05
SHANNON DERMER Yes, there you go. 

00:08:05
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN And it's true that society is very much heteronormative, that's the norms that based around as well as cis normative to use this. 

00:08:15
SHANNON DERMER Good. 

00:08:15
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Jargon. 

00:08:15
SHANNON DERMER Yes. Great I think it is important for, for umm… counselors to know the basic jargon or terminology and again when we are talking about diversity which is one of the accreditations standards for our students to be I mean not just in counseling in every major mental health organization they are supposed to be a sensitivity and knowledge based for a lots of different race, ethnicity, gender, you know, affectionate orientation, religion and so this will be some of the basic terminology that people should just know. 

00:08:50
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Absolutely. 

00:08:50
SHANNON DERMER So, cisgender and transgender. People use the term transgender or do people use the term transsexual anymore? 

00:08:55
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Yes, and it is a way of being transgender so to kind of unpack that the easiest way to go there I think is to talk about kind of a central division under that's transgender umbrella. Which would be the notion of binary or non-binary sort of representations. So, when you think about binary it is basically just male, female this or that. Non-binary means that there is this grey area in between maleness and femaleness this continuum and that's someone may identify somewhere on that continuum. So, people who are binary might be considered transsexual. They may not use that particular language to describe themselves and people may use many kinds of language to describe themselves which we can talk about in a bit, but transsexual is sometimes seen also as MTF or male to female or in the case of someone female assigned at birth it would be FTM female to male. And that means that they are transitioning in some way to another gender. It may be a social transition, may be medical, may be surgical, may be some combination of those. 

00:10:25
SHANNON DERMER But no one should assume because I think that there is that Misnomer that myth in society that if you are transgender it means that you are going to get your body changed to match to who you or how you identify who you feel you are. And that there is a mismatch between those so you are going to change your body to match that. Which is think is an over simplification, but that's what I think that most of those of the public. 

00:10:50
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Right, sort of them born in the wrong body sort of idea. Which some Trans people might use to describe themselves. And that's totally fine, but that doesn't describe everyone. So, there are people who are gender not conforming or might call themselves gender queer. And they are somewhere in the middle of that spectrum. They might be really androgynous and they are giants and then they might be by gender meaning reflecting elements of both genders at different times perhaps. So, there are many ways of being transgender and, you know, one thing of course to be cautious about with clients is not just assuming sort of one, sort of possibility. 

00:11:35
SHANNON DERMER Right and not to even if you are a little bit in touch with some of the issues with transgender counseling that it's not as you are saying it's not binary for everyone, it's not just. 

00:11:50
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Absolutely not. 

00:11:50
SHANNON DERMER Yes, and then I remember I cannot remember the author's name off hand and it's horrible, but I remember seeing the author of Stone butch blues speak many years ago, when I was a student when I was a therapist in training in a. 

00:12:00
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Is that Leslie Feinberg? 

00:12:05
SHANNON DERMER Yes, yes and I believe so because now it's on the video, but there's evidence. But I just remember the example that it's ridiculous in some ways that we see gender in this binary way and I remember the example that author used was like if we only had the words like hot and cold to describe weather. It would not tell us anything and it wouldn't be very useful. I mean it would tell us the extremes that is it was hot or cold. 

00:12:30
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Right. 

00:12:30
SHANNON DERMER And, but even that is open to interpretation, but that it's not very helpful to us to have only 2 terms to describe some very complex phenomena. But we do that with gender male or female. 

00:12:45
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Absolutely. Interesting that sort of thing that someone can do that if they want to dig into this further is Kate Bornstein has written a book called My Gender work book and that's really not, you know, for specialists. It's really kind of an end user book if you will and it gives a person an opportunity to really explore the sort of possibilities around gender and step back from this purely binary kind of notion she does a wonderful job with that in that book. 

00:13:15
SHANNON DERMER Good, good so what I know that we have only a few more minutes and then we are going to do a demonstration of an interview. Where I will play kind of like the counselor role and you would play the client role and how to have just a general discussion around some like gender issues in people's eyes hopefully in a respectful way. We will come back and you can admonish me for things I do incorrectly or not that I should. But what else do you think the people viewing should know before we do our demonstration? 

00:13:40
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Oh yes, sure. I think that there are just really some basic things about affirmative practice, you know, just expressing some kindness and I think that one of the big things is using peoples preferred pronouns so if the person that you see before you is expressing gender in a way that appears female, but you are not sure and may be you are not always sure it's really fine to ask and I think a really comfortable way to do it, is I might say, "Hi, I'm Christina use female pronouns, what's your name and what pronouns that you use." I could just ask someone. And then the tricky part maybe for many people is the use of gender neutral pronouns. So, we talked about gender non-conforming folks and they may prefer things like zis, zere, zheir's instead of she, her, her's for pronouns or he, him, his sorry. And or they, them, theirs, so, they them theirs are gender neutral and I know that English professors are reeling at that moment. Using their, then they in the singular, but it makes people feel comfortable and I think that's the real thing to keep in mind help your client to feel comfortable, affirmed and accepted and so, using appropriate pronouns, if the client has a preferred name that is not their legal name on their driver's license or insurance card for example. Use their preferred name. When referring to transgender and this is something that has changed I would say just more in the last few years. People used to say a person is transgendered. 

00:15:30
SHANNON DERMER Yes, with the "ed" at the end meaning transgendered. 

00:15:30
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Right or this person is a transgender like a noun and that has really changed and today we say, this is a transgender person. A transgender man, a transgender woman or umm… uh, this person is transgender not with the ed on it. 

00:15:50
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:15:50
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN So, other kinds of pieces of language that have changed some isn't very old fashioned term is transvestite. Which some people you still hear using. But that's really describing people who would identify themselves as cross dressers. 

00:16:05
SHANNON DERMER Right that never actually applied even though people used it's not that the term has changed it actually never fit transgender people. It was someone who preferred to dress in or cross dress, but also it typically referred to someone who got some sexual pleasure out of cross dressing. 

00:16:25
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Possibly, but not all cross dressers do derive sexual pleasure from that someone say that they derive comfort from it. So, you can have kind of mixtures that a cross dresser for example who's a heterosexual male who identifies as male so gender identity, and biological sex is aligned at male, but expresses themselves as female expression. 

00:16:50
SHANNON DERMER Right, but that would be cross dresser? 

00:16:50
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN That would be a Cross dresser. 

00:16:50
SHANNON DERMER Not transvestite. 

00:16:55
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Not transvestite. Right that is sort of an old term and then there is kind of the controversial term which some people certainly think of as a slur of the word Tranny, which is sort of tossed around casually and it is important to recognize that some transgender people have reclaimed that term and take ownership of it and accept it while others may be really deeply offended it by it so it's just the idea is to be sort of be cautious. Ask your client, you know, be, you know, sensitive and aware, be with and for your client. In a way that allows you to understand what it is for them. So, I think that one thing for people who are just kind of figuring this out want to do is start categorizing and labeling people and that's really not helpful. It is just much easier to be open ask open ended questions and find out. How your client identifies. 

00:17:55
SHANNON DERMER Okay, I do want to point out to you because it is for a lot of marginalized groups where they might reclaim a term that whether that relates to race, religion, gender? 

00:18:05
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Sure, yes. 

00:18:05
SHANNON DERMER And that doesn't mean that's it's okay for other people to use the term, because if they use it why can't I use it, it's different when someone who is part of the group uses it rather than someone who is outside. So, even if your client might be using language that you are saying, oh, some people don't like that you still need to be careful and check with them if they are okay if you are not part of that community if they are okay with you using it. 

00:18:30
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Yes, they want you to use it. 

00:18:35
SHANNON DERMER Yeah, we see that a lot with a lot of different things like you said race, you know, that if you are part of the group you can use it if you are not part of the group you can't, because it takes on a different meaning when someone else outside the group uses it. 

00:18:45
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN It does, right more quickly becomes provocative in that sense. So, I think, That great asking questions is wonderful, showing interest is usually well received now that being said, one kind of mistake or easy common mistake that people starting out working with this population might do. And people in the general public do they leap to what I am calling the surgery question. So they want to know what's between this person's legs and if you think about it that way. You know how often in life does someone ask you about your gentile area who is not your physician or a partner or right. 

00:19:25
SHANNON DERMER Occasionally at a bat, but usually they get slapped. 

00:19:25
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN See, so, it's really, you know, it's never really appropriate, you know, to leap to this question. 

00:19:35
SHANNON DERMER We do, you know, a lot of people do that. 

00:19:35
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN They do and they equate transsexual or transsexuality with surgery which in fact it is not. So, people can transition in many ways and many, many people will never be able to afford surgery. Many of us there is great inequality in terms of health care coverage for trans people. We are quite marginalized in that sense. So, some people might want it and never be able to have it. Some people may just never want it or need it and it doesn't change who they are and it doesn't change that that their identity is their identity. Yeah. 

00:20:10
SHANNON DERMER Okay, now we just have a minute or so left before we move to our interview demonstration is there anything else you think that everyone needs to know? 

00:20:20
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN I just want to say and it takes a great deal of thought later, but it is the idea of know and known your own privilege so, if you are male, or cisgender or heterosexual etc. Those ways of being have privilege if you are Caucasian those things come with privilege and society. It's really important for counselors I think that we identify our own privilege. 

00:20:40
SHANNON DERMER Privilege. 

00:20:45
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Yes, it helps us to understand people who don't have those privileges or lost them. 

00:20:50
SHANNON DERMER I 100 percent agree because it is privilege it's invisible to us sometimes in the ways that we are privileged. 

00:20:55
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Yes 

00:20:55
SHANNON DERMER When we come back and talk after the interview maybe you can give some examples of around at least gender. How people have privilege and they may not even be aware of it. 

00:21:10
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Sure.

00:21:15
with Christienne Dyslin, Ph.D. 

00:21:15
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:21:20
SHANNON DERMER Good afternoon, I am Dr. Shannon Dermer, but you can call me Shannon, Dr. Dermer. I actually prefer Shannon, whatever you are comfortable with and I know your full name is Dr. Christienne Dyslin what name do you prefer and what pronoun do you prefer to be called? 

00:21:35
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN I use female pronouns and you can just call me Christienne. Please. 

00:21:40
SHANNON DERMER Oh great, that makes things easy. Thank you Christienne. Umm… This is our first meeting so I just want to get to know you a little bit today and a little bit about your story. 

00:21:50
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Okay. 

00:21:50
SHANNON DERMER So what do you think it's important for me to know about you? 

00:21:55
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Umm… well, Certainly you should be aware that I am transgender woman and that I transitioned I would say about four years ago, it started and it was quite a gradual sort of process for me. 

00:22:15
SHANNON DERMER Four years ago and I know it is a little uncouth, but may I ask your age? 

00:22:15
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Well, I am in my 50's so I came out really late in life and I think that, you know, may not be always the case for people in my situation, but I think if you even think about the culture back in the 1960's and 70's I didn't know what transgender was. I had no earthly idea. I never heard that word. I had never heard gay or lesbian or any of those words as a kid or really even as a young teenager. So, for me I know that sometimes people in my situation will say I have always known exactly this way or that. But for me I knew something, you know, that, you know, in my mind was horribly wrong with me. umm… I did know per say that you know, I was umm… mismatched a bit always. 

00:23:20
SHANNON DERMER But you didn't know that was truly about gender because you said you didn't know that term or that it really fit you when you were younger so what was kind of your concept of what was going on? 

00:23:30
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Yes, this is so hard to kind of go back and figure out now what I have gone back and what have I sorted out retrospectively? Say in the last you know, eight years or so that I have been working on this internally figuring it out. Umm… and what did I really know at the time and I remember if I go back retroactively and think oh yes, I remember asking my mother what would you have named me if I was a girl and things like that and, you know, things with clothing, you know, not being happy with the clothes that I had. Not per say I want that or this, but just being rally happy with what it was and, you know, having, you know, similar experiences that I think many transgender woman have had especially of kind of going into closets and finding clothes and trying things on and kind of finding that maybe that was a better fit or either those clothes seem to fit me better. But for me I think a lot of it was just kind of buried because I couldn't really conceptionalise what that was and I think the general understanding of that a person got from everyone. Every corner of the world was you are what you are assigned at birth. So, for me I didn't, but I always thought of myself as something very defective or I knew something was horribly I knew something was wrong with me. I couldn't figure out what it was and I certainly didn't really recognize that I was trans. 

00:25:10
SHANNON DERMER So, you knew that maybe something didn't fit for you? 

00:25:10
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Right. 

00:25:15
SHANNON DERMER That you weren't a 100 percent comfortable and you knew you wanted something different for yourself, but you couldn't label it at the time. There wasn't like that inside awareness at the time. Partially because you were saying because the society that just weren't terms and words that you heard and then partially because you couldn't really understand all of it. 

00:25:35
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN I think the not fitting that's a really great word to describe it. Like I never felt like I fit anywhere and as certainly as I got older in school, you know, I felt really uncomfortable and sort of male only spaces like the locker room and stuff and I would always find ways to get out of gym I think. I might hold a record might have held a record at my high school for missing like for three years of gym or something. 

00:26:05
SHANNON DERMER Well, they are here today to give you an award. 

00:26:05
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Yes, excellent, finally. 

00:26:10
SHANNON DERMER Yes, recognition. 

00:26:10
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN We all figured it out. 

00:26:10
SHANNON DERMER Hmm, but so you had some level of awareness that things didn't fit for you what about your parents or family members or friends was there anyone who was aware that you might have had a bit of a struggle? 

00:26:25
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Yes, and No. certainly in junior high school there were issues not I would claim that it was stomach trouble for things like that. We try to kind of, I wasn't subsidizing it, but I kind of thought that sounds better, than just saying how horribly sad I was, umm… but, you know, I would get sent home from school and I remember just breaking down crying in a counselor's office probably 7th grade or something like that and they thought oh was I depressed or, you know, that sort of stuff so I think they knew kind of that stuff. 

00:27:10
SHANNON DERMER So, they knew that you were kind of unhappy, but they didn't really know why. 

00:27:10
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Yes. And both my parent's kind of had a sense of that, you know, they couldn't understand why I wasn't sort of comfortable or more happier with myself. But I think they probably passed of some of it off as just adolescent angst. 

00:27:30
SHANNON DERMER Yes, was they any particular ways that you should to deal with that unhappiness? 

00:27:35
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Oh, absolutely, yes, I in terms of healthy ways I kind of really threw myself into arty and music and things that where I felt more free or kind of unencumbered by this stuff and then in terms of unhealthy ways, you know, I've really had a lot of trouble with substance abuse starting in high school and I was a little bit of a late bloomer. So, it seemed to really get worse in college, you know, and I think that probably other trans woman have this experience too like if you don't have to shave and things like that you could kind of that was that era, where I could wear my hair quite long and so I could feel more, but then certain queues like secondary sex characteristics would just be these horrible kinds of reminders in some ways of so that kind of started getting worse, you know, in college and really had a lot of really severe sort of depressive episodes associated with it. And substance abuse and other sorts of issues that we were just trying to I think just block it out. But even then I didn't recognize that the time, Why that would be troubling for me. You know I was a very tall person and I kept getting taller and I would think, you know, No, no, no. , you know, it and, but I didn't sort of connect with the idea that that would be very common for a female to think that I don't want to be, you know, over six feet tall. 

00:29:15
SHANNON DERMER So you can go now unless you are a super model, but, Christienne, if you could go back now and recognize some of the things and give meaning to it now. But at the time you just knew it made you uncomfortable or made you anxious or made you unhappy, but you didn't really put all the pieces of the puzzle together that it related to gender. 

00:29:35
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Oh yes, not directly, you know, like that was there and it was there right under the surface so then as I got older the discomfort and the not fitting always fit in and I went out and took a business career and, you know, never quite felt comfortable in my skin felt like I couldn't really fit in where I would fit in and I tried really hard so I threw myself into and I think that I was certainly aware of in terms of trying hard to be more male. I thought that maybe I think that that would help me to, you know, feel better or feel like I fit or something. 

00:30:20
SHANNON DERMER So you are saying in college and things like this especially in seventies and eighties it was okay to have a little bit longer hair and things like that. Then later on you are saying you tried to be more what some people call masculine, like the traditional masculine. So how did you do that? 

00:30:35
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Absolutely, I was able to, you know, have a beard or grow one by then I think by then I was a man in my 20's I think that I could, but then. 

00:30:45
SHANNON DERMER So you grew a beard? 

00:30:45
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Right I did that and umm… I remember like when I had to have my hair cut, you know, for like business and stuff like that and that was always difficult and even then my manager would be the person who would have to tell me you need to go have a haircut, you know, I never wanted to get a haircut so there were things like that I think and I also kind of had hoped that I could find if you will a religious solutions to things too and so I became as I went on to adulthood I became more strongly deeply more religious and more committed. 

00:31:25
SHANNON DERMER In a particular faith? 

00:31:30
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN It was the Christian faith, catholic faith and I worked really hard at that and I worked really hard at a lot of those things kind of, you know, learning later that, you know, that you don't have to work quite so hard at things really when you got the basics in order. 

00:31:45
SHANNON DERMER So it sounds like you were searching for some comfort and safety and meaning through becoming a devote catholic for a while? Would that be accurate? 

00:31:55
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Absolutely, yes and I, you know, from my perspective at the time I guess I, you know, hoped that maybe God would fix my problem. And just like I had kind of hoped at one time, that maybe I just you know, found the right drug or did the right thing, you know, maybe that would fix my problem. 

00:32:15
SHANNON DERMER So you said that you started to transition about four years ago. I know it was a slow transition, but when did you start to realize that that term transgender might actually apply to you and your life? 

00:32:30
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Umm… Actually that about 11 maybe almost 12 years ago now and it happened in a very ironic way because I had grown up with a person who was a transgender woman, but unbeknownst to me and she had transitions and moves out of state, you know, way back I think the early 90's and everyone has lost track of her a friend of ours sort of found her and so she came out in that process and for me it was my reaction to her that kind of broke everything open for me. I had a really terrible transphobic, you know, it's embarrassing to admit, but it is just the reality I had this very transphobic reaction to learning about this. Even earlier when I encountered or saw things I would be both drawn to it like I can remember seeing something about Renee Richards and maybe a time magazine or something like that and my parents had it, you know, being very interested in that. But then I would also be kind of repulsed and as time went on that kind of got stronger. So, I had this horrible reaction which at some level I knew. 

00:33:50
SHANNON DERMER You are trying to protect yourself in some way? 

00:33:50
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Oh this is just so wrong like in my profession like in my field like this is completely wrong like what is going on? And that precipitated some real sort of inner work to try and both understand that and I thought I need to understand her better and I need to understand that and sort of entering into that process you know. Everything I just starting just kind of reading everything that I could get my hands on professional literature etc. 

00:34:20
SHANNON DERMER And that kind of clicked for you? 

00:34:20
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Oh everything that I read was oh that's me though, that's me and that's me. And it just sort of broke through all this kind of denial and stuff. 

00:34:30
SHANNON DERMER And I know that we have only about six or seven more minutes. So, I just want to ask you without getting or violating their privacy too much because they are not here with us today, but, you know, you are married and you have kids and you are married excuse me and you have children and so when did you started to realize this when you became more comfortable with the idea that you might be transgender and then you said yes, this fits for me and you start recognizing yourself in those things? How did your spouse and, you know, your partner and children react when you told them? 

00:35:05
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN It has been really, really difficult for all of us. But, you know, especially difficult for my spouse in the sense as you can imagine for any spouse I always say to people, you know, just imagine that you are married to someone and you have been married to them for a long time and then they say, you know, I think that I am going to completely change gender like the person you wake up with in the morning you were used to being female is now going to have a beard and a deep voice and kind of rougher skin and, but that's the same person. You know and we often say think and certainly I do, you know, I am still me. Maybe even more so me than ever and she can recognize that, but still it's just a huge thing and we had to do a lot of work to, you know, work through that and manage to stay together and have our family to stay intact. My kids what we did, it was easier for them, no that's not right that's not true. 

00:36:20
SHANNON DERMER It's different for them. 

00:36:20
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN It was different for them culturally, you know, because my spouse and I are similar age, you know, for my kids I remember my youngest daughter said, "Oh, yeah, I am learning about that in school in health class, I know what that is." And I just said, you know, what transgender is? Yes, I know what that is. So, they at least they had an understanding of the concept, but for everyone it was a challenge to push through in many ways. I have my children and my spouse were not surprised in terms of some things. Because there is only so much that I think that a person can. 

00:36:55
SHANNON DERMER Suppress. 

00:36:55
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Suppress, yes, in this sort of circumstance. 

00:37:00
SHANNON DERMER So, obviously there's have been can I say identity change, but you said you are becoming more of you, but to the outside world it was an identity change. 

00:37:05
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Right. 

00:37:10
SHANNON DERMER Has it changed their identities in any ways now to have a spouse or a parent that is transgender? 

00:37:15
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Absolutely when you think about like families like mine is in that situation too like we have lost our parent pattern of sexual privilege, which, you know, what is that I mean, you know, if you if I go with my partner to buy groceries together and we are clearly shopping together it's amazing how often are these together, are your groceries together. If we eat out do you want separate checks? As a parent heterosexual, cisgender couple. Those questions were never asked and it could easily be assumed, so, I mean there are all kinds of privileges that just people asking if you ask someone hey, I'm looking for my spouse here and they assume a person of the opposite gender. Right the notion of heteronormative I am counted out all the time and misgendering and all kinds of other things and people who don't understand so when a spouse has to say oh, you know, my spouse is coming or what is he no it's a she, oh, wait what is that mean about it for you. So, there are just lots and lots of different ways that it effects all of, all of us in that sense. I say sometimes that, you know, I am someone who has reclaimed the word queer, but in some ways I have said and we have recognized when I came out when I transitioned it queered the family in that sense. So, the whole family is in this process of transition and. 

00:39:00
SHANNON DERMER Right, so it wasn't just you that had the transition it was the whole family because now your kids don't just say, oh, mom and dad. 

00:39:05
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN They have two women. 

00:39:05
SHANNON DERMER Yes, or and the assumptions about you and your spouse and the kids and oh you must have two, you know, lesbian parents or you must have when the kids do now have two females well they always have had, but nor they have two female parents. 

00:39:20
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Right. 

00:39:25
SHANNON DERMER But that doesn't necessarily say anything about your guy's sexual orientation and it doesn't say anything about a lot of things that people would assume and then you are talking about the privilege that not only did it change some of your privilege before being identified as a Christian, heterosexual, male. It changed your, you know, it changed your privilege, but also by default or association in some ways has changed your spouse's privilege in some ways that she had. 

00:39:55
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Yes, and these things are, you know, just, you know, I think it's really important for me to say like these things that I am talking about like this is one kind of level and there are big things bit there are not huge things I think that when you I know that people in my situation who are not Caucasian transgender and, you know, women of color trans people of color really have a whole different level and way more complicated experiences and way more hurdles and difficulties. So, I don't want you to think oh listen to her whine about, you know, it's just, you know, this is the reality of the circumstance, because I have lost some of that privilege, but you have kept some of those. 

00:40:40
SHANNON DERMER You still have white privilege. 

00:40:40
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Yes, exactly. 

00:40:45
SHANNON DERMER You still have education, you know, money although you don't think you are paid as much as you should be. 

00:40:50
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN But I have a job and a lot of trans people don't and so, you know, I have health insurance that covers some part of you know. 

00:41:00
SHANNON DERMER So you are still advantaged in and still have privilege in some areas, but you have lost in others. But then I think your point is because I know that we have to wrap up our time a little bit, but that there is your story and that is shared by some other transgender people, but then there are differences based on people's background and how their families accepted and how the privileges, or the lack of privileges that they have and that. 

00:41:20
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Like generational kind of differences. So many differences race, culture, everything yeah. 

00:41:30
SHANNON DERMER Yeah, okay well there are a lot more ways I would love to get to know you and hopefully will in the future, but I know our time for now is done. So, thank you very much for telling me a little bit about your story. 

00:41:40
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Thanks.

00:41:45
WRAP-UP 

00:41:45
with Christienne Dyslin, Ph.D. 

00:41:45
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:41:50
SHANNON DERMER Christienne, thank you for doing that little mock interview with me and I mean I know that we are pretending more like we are counselor and client, but that was real information about you and your life. 

00:42:00
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Yes. It was. 

00:42:05
SHANNON DERMER And so I want to say I am going to start this kind of conversation off by like if I was really your counselor some of the things that not being an expert working with gender issues and transgender counseling that I know I paused in my own mind a few times and is this the right way to say this not right, but respectful, affirming safe way to say it. I guess. When, you used the word transition first so I uses that and I am always no matter who I am working with use the language that the person uses. 

00:42:35
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Yes, right. 

00:42:35
SHANNON DERMER And so you used that and you said not everybody has this like transition time, but for you it was a transition. 

00:42:45
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Yes, I did transition from male to female. 

00:42:50
SHANNON DERMER Yes, right where there would be the word transition might not fit for someone who doesn't have that binary Du or someone who had that awareness and was able to look to use that concept early on that might not have been like this transition, you know. 

00:43:05
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Yes, and I think that the fact that you didn't leap to that it's like for me that didn't leave me to feel less understood. I think you used general language and general terms and you know, the one thing that was interesting is that you said fit in which really struck a chord for me in me that oh, yeah, that's very much. So for me that like communicated empathy or communicated that whenever I was trying to get across to you, you were really hearing and understanding it to that level because you said fit and yes, that's exactly and note that had no jargon in it whatsoever. It was just a basic kind of understanding of a human dilemma. 

00:43:55
SHANNON DERMER Right and that's what I would say is a lot of it is listening to your client and using their language and no matter what the issues. But I do think that for certain populations or certain issues there also should be a basic awareness of language and what that means. So you are not making your client be your teacher all the time. 

00:44:15
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Right. 

00:44:15
SHANNON DERMER Now we didn't use terms like cisgender, we used transgender which you talked a little bit about gender you talked a little bit about secondary sex characteristics which most people should know what that is through health class, but I know I was a little careful when I was thinking about, umm… oh, before you were male now you are female because that was never the case you were always female. 

00:44:40
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN You caught yourself at one point and I heard that and you said something that reflected sort of my understanding of myself that I lived as a male, you know, that I lived as a male and verses was this and now I am that and I am more of how I lived. So, I noticed that a bit and I think you didn't use the term coming out for example, you know, you didn't say when did you come out to yourself or how did you come out to yourself or when you came out. I don't think you did, did you? 

00:45:10
SHANNON DERMER I said when did you actually recognize that that term fit for you. 

00:45:15
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Right. 

00:45:15
SHANNON DERMER Because you said early on that I didn't really know that term and I didn't think that it fit for me, so that is when I said later on when did you recognize or become aware I believe that's what I said that that did fit for you. 

00:45:30
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN And I think that's such a great sort of example of how people who are really generalists who really just make an effort to be ethical in their practice and be accepting and affirming of all people cannot have to know a ton of jargon or language and can help a person who is transgender, you know, to feel accepted. It's not so much of the terms, but sort of the concepts right. So, you don't have to know come out to yourself or something like that and the person I think will understand what you are asking. 

00:46:10
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. Well, you said that for some people there never is this coming on process because they always knew and they were always aware, you know, from a young age and then for other people they weren't aware they just knew that they like you said didn't quite fit in that there were something that felt off that they didn't know what it was and later on they could see it, but at the time they couldn't see it. 

00:46:30
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Right. 

00:46:35
SHANNON DERMER So I think you have to be careful of using that kind of language because it wouldn't fit for some people and would fit for others like coming out or transitioning. 

00:46:40
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Right. 

00:46:40
SHANNON DERMER And things like that. I know that when I did catch myself was… I was going to say, "Oh, I think I was going to say that you kind of caught it." I was going to say, "Oh, when you became female?" Which wouldn't be more accurate, but you have used the term become more even more of yourself and so I stopped myself and said when you became even more of yourself because there is always that female part there, but you just didn't know it and so when you were able to identify it and be who you are. 

00:47:20
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN And then being in the client role in this so from my end when you say something like that I feel much more affirmed, you know, my sense is that you as the counselor get this to some extent and that you umm… care about me enough that you are affirming, you know, who I am and in that certainly accepting it, like it's way beyond just being tolerant. 

00:47:50
SHANNON DERMER Right, right. I think, I think especially when there is a more sensitive subject I mean sensitive in that what we talked about the suicide risks and attempts that's it's sensitive, you know, you need to be affirming to someone and accepting and not that you aren't, but they need to feel that, that you are much more careful and it's a little bit more scary I think for most counselors because they do want that and there are big repercussions if your client doesn't feel like that. 

00:48:15
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Right. 

00:48:20
SHANNON DERMER But also I think especially for counselors in training it might be a little bit more difficult they might worry about making a mistake. 

00:48:30
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Right and I also think that clinical sort of balance of if, you know, that you have someone who is part of this population that's very vulnerable to suicide. 

00:48:40
SHANNON DERMER Oh, yes that's what I was looking for. 

00:48:40
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Do you want to follow through and ask if there had been attempts and you didn't do this in this case probably for a number of reasons, but I think that then you are always balancing that with just wanting to know the person and not rush into that, but that is important to know that if the person is reporting depression etc. then it's really important to check that out. 

00:49:05
SHANNON DERMER Oh yes I think you would always want to no matter what in clinical settings violence, suicide anyone who is coming into the clinical setting you will always want to access that no matter what, but I did, we only have a couple of minutes. I wanted to ask though because you did notice a couple of times where I did hesitated from a cline point of view did that hurt our relationship at all? 

00:49:30
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN No, no and I think, you know, a couple of things that come to my mind one is, you know, if, if, if you as a counselor mis-gender someone accidently and advertently. Just apologize and move on. You know, it Just I'm sorry I meant this and just move on it's the bigger a deal that I make of that as a therapist the bigger it seems. But it's good not to ignore it and pretend that it didn't happen because your client heard it and, you know, it's important to do that and I think that other thing that you just said we haven't talked about at all because we are just scratching the surface here. The issue of violence there are so many transgender people have been victims of violence and that may be the case with a client or again as you said a family member who is trans and it's good to be aware of that. 

00:50:30
SHANNON DERMER Okay good. I know we are just out of just about out of time and like you said we barely scratched the surface, but so I would encourage any of the counselor trainees any counselor educators, counselor supervisors to look up a lot more information and there's are a lot of great information on there a little bit accreditation standards about diversity, but also there are specific standards from different organizations that they can look up and how to work with transgender clients. But basically I think what we are trying to say is know the basic terms the basic ideas about gender and the key thing is just like with all clients be respectful, built that therapeutic alliance. 

00:51:10
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN Absolutely. 

00:51:10
SHANNON DERMER And if you make a mistake acknowledge it and be respectful and move on and your client may respect and like you for it. 

00:51:20
CHRISTIENNE DYSLIN I think that's absolutely right. It sounds good to me. 

00:51:25
SHANNON DERMER Great, thank you so much for joining us today and thank all of you for joining us for CACREP essential skills for counseling practice I hope you learned something and that you enjoyed it.
