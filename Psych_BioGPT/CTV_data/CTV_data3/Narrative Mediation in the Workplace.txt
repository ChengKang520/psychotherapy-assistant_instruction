00:00:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Well, welcome here and you're Michelle, right? 

00:00:30
MICHELLE Yes, Michelle. 

00:00:30
JOHN WINSLADE And you are Lisa? 

00:00:35
LISA Yes, I'm. 

00:00:35
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, okay. Thank you for coming. And, uhm, I understand from, uhm, Mr. Clark(ph) who called me, Chuck Clark(ph) that he employs both of you, is that correct? 

00:00:45
LISA Yes. 

00:00:50
MICHELLE Yes. 

00:00:50
Pre-figures externalizing conversation 

00:00:50
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, okay. And that there had been some issues that have arisen, ah, in your employment, uhm, and I don't know much about those at the moment. Uhm, I'm gonna need to find out from you, but what my hoping here is that we can have a conversation where we talk about the issues that are being causing difficulty and that we can see if we can make progress towards working out how you and how things can go forward from here. How does that sound? Is that fit with your idea or what we are here to do? 

00:01:20
LISA Well, yeah. We need, we need some help. 

00:01:25
JOHN WINSLADE You need some help? 

00:01:25
LISA Yes. 

00:01:25
JOHN WINSLADE How about your Michelle? 

00:01:25
Dialogical introduction to process 

00:01:25
MICHELLE Uhm, I agree. I mean I, I don't think there really is a problem. I think Lisa is making it into problems, so I hope this will help. 

00:01:35
JOHN WINSLADE So that you've come here with some hope that - 

00:01:35
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:01:35
JOHN WINSLADE - we can have a conversation that would help? 

00:01:40
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:01:40
JOHN WINSLADE All right. Okay. So, let me just explain what I understand mediation to be. Uhm, First of all, this is the chance for you two to workout what's gonna make a difference, not for Mr. Clark(ph) and not for me to decide, but for you two. Does that make sense? 

00:01:55
LISA Uh-hmm. 

00:01:55
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:01:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, I'm not gonna make any decisions on your behalf, this is just a chance for you to have a good conversation where you can kind of reach of some understanding of what's important between you and, you know, work on what might come out of that for a future for, for your working situation. 

00:02:15
LISA Okay. 

00:02:15
JOHN WINSLADE Is that what you thought you were coming for, something like that? 

00:02:20
LISA I think so. Yeah that was what I was told. 

00:02:20
MICHELLE Okay. I didn't know that it was up to us. 

00:02:25
JOHN WINSLADE You didn't - 

00:02:25
MICHELLE I thought... 

00:02:25
JOHN WINSLADE - know complete that it was up to you? 

00:02:25
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:02:25
JOHN WINSLADE All right. Is that okay then if you? 

00:02:25
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:02:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Because I'm not gonna tell you what to do, this is your life and your work and, and I'm just here to help and have a, a conversation that will make - 

00:02:35
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:02:35
JOHN WINSLADE - it go as well as possible. Okay? 

00:02:35
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:02:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, uhm, I'm gonna may give you each a chance to speak about the things that are important to you and I'm gonna ask you some questions about that. Okay? 

00:02:50
LISA Okay. 

00:02:50
MICHELLE All right. 

00:02:50
JOHN WINSLADE And, ah, it maybe, at certain point that where at least of speaking where you're thinking there are things that you would like to say and I want you to be sure that I'm gonna come to you and ask you about those things. In, ah, in a in-- in about a minute or two, is that okay? 

00:03:05
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:03:05
Parties participate in setting groundrules 

00:03:05
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, I'm wondering whether you have any thoughts about what's gonna make it okay for you to talk about these issues cuz I know they're sensitive things and there, you know, there's been some-- as I understand that some things that have gone and had you upset with each other. And I'm wondering what would be-- what would make it okay for you to anticipate in this conversation. I mean, you know, maybe some agreements about, you know, what we have as ground rules or anything like that. 

00:03:35
LISA No, I just hope that we can, you know, develop a better understanding and I want her to understand where I'm coming from, so yeah. 

00:03:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, I guess that's what I'm asking. What would make it possible for you to have, uhm, you know what, what do we need to agree on that would help it make it possible to have that kind of conversation that you just described? 

00:03:55
LISA Mainly both must beyond more open-minded and I don't know - 

00:04:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:04:00
LISA - I'm not so sure. 

00:04:00
JOHN WINSLADE That more open-minded? 

00:04:00
LISA Yeah. 

00:04:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Anything you can think of that would be, that help us to have that conversation we need to settle and agree on now? 

00:04:05
MICHELLE I think it would be helpful if Lisa didn't attacking my ideas. 

00:04:10
JOHN WINSLADE So you would like the conversation that didn't involve attacking each others ideas with that both ways? 

00:04:20
MICHELLE I guess so, yeah. 

00:04:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. How does that sound to you? 

00:04:20
LISA It sounds okay. 

00:04:20
First elements of a counter story 

00:04:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So we would have that down as something like not attacking each others ideas. Does that sound right? 

00:04:35
LISA It sounds right. 

00:04:35
JOHN WINSLADE Anything else like that? 

00:04:40
MICHELLE Uhm, That's good for me. 

00:04:45
JOHN WINSLADE That's good for you. 

00:04:45
Negotiating confidentiality 

00:04:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. One other thing I would like to just check like, I mean what happens here-- I mean I won't speak about to anybody else, but I'm wondering, you know, have you either of you talked to anyone else about these issues when you are coming here, who may need to know, ah, ah, what happens here or do you want this conversation just to be between you or just between you or Mr. Clark(ph) or what? 

00:05:10
LISA I've gone to Mr. Clark(ph) several times. That's about it for me. Mr. Clark(ph) 

00:05:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. You haven't consulted anyone else? 

00:05:15
LISA Uhm-hmm. 

00:05:20
JOHN WINSLADE Like anyone here or anything like that? 

00:05:20
LISA No, no. Not at this point. 

00:05:20
JOHN WINSLADE What about you? 

00:05:20
MICHELLE Same with me. 

00:05:20
JOHN WINSLADE Same with you. 

00:05:20
MICHELLE I didn't talk with Mr. Clark(ph), several times. 

00:05:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, is Mr. Clark wanting to know from you how this went? And if so, do you need to talk to him about-- do we need, do we need to include him in understanding what happened to you? Or is it okay for just between you two and me? 

00:05:40
MICHELLE I would like him to know. 

00:05:45
JOHN WINSLADE Just - 

00:05:45
MICHELLE How... 

00:05:45
JOHN WINSLADE - the details or just the outcome? 

00:05:45
MICHELLE The outcome. 

00:05:50
JOHN WINSLADE The outcome. Okay. 

00:05:50
LISA Oh, good I would like to him to be you know part of this or involved in some way, yeah. 

00:05:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So maybe, we can come back to that and talk about how he would need to be involved at the end. 

00:06:00
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:06:00
JOHN WINSLADE Is that okay? 

00:06:00
LISA Okay. 

00:06:05
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, Any other questions before we get started about this? 

00:06:10
MICHELLE Uhm... 

00:06:10
LISA I don't have any with this point though. 

00:06:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Michelle? 

00:06:15
MICHELLE I guess I'm wondering what's going to happen? Like how... 

00:06:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay Do you have some concerns of what might happen? 

00:06:25
MICHELLE Yeah because you said that we are the ones that are deciding what happens. 

00:06:30
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:06:30
MICHELLE So I guess I'm curious about how that's gonna help. 

00:06:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. I don't know at this stage what's going to happen, of course, but I want you to feel like you can control the process and it's up to you to say, you know, what's working for you and whether this conversation is taking things where you want them to go. It's not like I'm a judge that's what I mean. 

00:06:50
MICHELLE Oh, okay. 

00:06:50
JOHN WINSLADE I'm not going to come down with the ruling and say who is right or who is wrong or anything like that. 

00:06:55
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:06:55
JOHN WINSLADE Is that sound clear? 

00:06:55
MICHELLE Yeah that make sense. 

00:07:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Uhm, but you're not, I, I want you to, to be clear that you don't have to make any decision at all. This is up to you. Just that I'm not gonna make any decisions about your life because that's your life. 

00:07:10
MICHELLE Oh, okay. 

00:07:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay? 

00:07:15
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:07:15
JOHN WINSLADE Is that okay? 

00:07:15
LISA That's fine with me. 

00:07:20
JOHN WINSLADE Is there any other questions? 

00:07:20
MICHELLE No. 

00:07:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So you both happy to go ahead with the conversation, ah, about the issues that are outstanding between you at this point. 

00:07:30
LISA Yeah, I'm ready. 

00:07:30
JOHN WINSLADE You ready? 

00:07:30
MICHELLE I'm ready. 

00:07:30
Focus first on hopes not wants 

00:07:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Then we begin by asking this. What I'm mentioning is that as you came along here today, you both have some hopes for what kind of conversation we might have. And we've I guess been talking a little bit about that, I mean you said that would wanted to be something that's not attacking each other’s ideas. Do you have any other things that you would like to put out for the kind of conversation that might be useful, you know that would be and you describe something that would be helpful. But I'm wondering you know what, what sort of hope did you have as you came here for a kind of conversation, we might have? 

00:08:15
MICHELLE I was hoping that I would be hurt. 

00:08:15
JOHN WINSLADE You would be hurt? 

00:08:20
MICHELLE They would be giving a chance and then, and Lisa would listen to the ideas that I've been trying to share. 

00:08:25
JOHN WINSLADE So you'd given a chance and look that if you're listened to. 

00:08:30
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

00:08:30
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Okay. 

00:08:35
LISA I just hope that she understands that, uhm, this is the way its always been, I'm not picking on her, you know, I just-- this is just the way I've always done it. I've been here 12 years and I know how I would like to work and so I just want her to know just that I'm not picking on her and I'm just-- this is the way it's been. 

00:08:55
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. Okay. So, for you a conversation that you would hope that we would have here, it would be you want that increase that understanding. 

00:09:00
LISA Yes. 

00:09:00
Elements of a possible counter story 

00:09:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, so you, what we're expressing here is the is the desire for a conversation about involves hearing, listening and understanding. 

00:09:15
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:09:15
JOHN WINSLADE Anything else that you'd hope for that we would have by way of that conversation? 

00:09:20
MICHELLE Uhm... 

00:09:20
JOHN WINSLADE How about you? 

00:09:25
LISA Maybe just to, to maybe, come to some type of agreement. 

00:09:25
Goal for the conversation 

00:09:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Come to agreement. 

00:09:35
MICHELLE I was hoping that Lisa will be willing to come to that agreement. 

00:09:40
JOHN WINSLADE So you got an-- you had an idea that you could let's have an agreement - 

00:09:45
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:09:45
JOHN WINSLADE - that come with us too? Okay. So, we have got that as an another hope for this conversation that will bring us to some kind of agreement. 

00:09:50
MICHELLE Alright. 

00:09:50
JOHN WINSLADE And I'll talk, and then would ask you in a minute about what, but just that that would be part of this. Anything else that, that you'd hope that this conversation would feature? 

00:10:05
LISA Just may be resolve this issue and move on, you know, uhm... 

00:10:10
Writing parties' words makes them reverberate longer 

00:10:10
JOHN WINSLADE Resolve? I think you would resolve this issue and you tell me a minute what that issue is, but any other issues as well and, and move on. 

00:10:20
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

00:10:25
JOHN WINSLADE Is that fit for you too? 

00:10:25
MICHELLE Yeah, I just wanna be, uhm, have a pleasant work environment. 

00:10:30
Possible name for counter story 

00:10:30
JOHN WINSLADE A pleasant work environment. That's what you are hoping for. 

00:10:30
MICHELLE That's what I'm hoping for after this. 

00:10:35
JOHN WINSLADE How's that sound to you? 

00:10:35
LISA It sounds okay. 

00:10:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Any other thoughts about that? 

00:10:45
LISA Well, just remember that it's a family environment, well it's a family environment and, ah, just you know I guess keep everybody you know... 

00:10:55
JOHN WINSLADE So for you, a pleasant work environment would be like a family environment. 

00:11:00
LISA Yes. 

00:11:00
JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

00:11:00
LISA Yes, yes. Exactly. 

00:11:00
Constructs problem as restraining the counter story 

00:11:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So you got these ideas about what kind of conversation we might have that it would be about peering, listening, understanding, reaching agreements, resolving issues and establishing a pleasant working environment, but my understanding is that there been things that, I mean getting in the way of that for both of you. 

00:11:25
LISA Yes. 

00:11:25
JOHN WINSLADE You know of all of those things, you know I guess it's a good time now to ask you to tell us, to tell me, to tell each other as well what have been the issues that have been getting in the way of the pleasant working environment for you know it would be... 

00:11:40
LISA Well, I-- I'll start. I've been here... 

00:11:45
JOHN WINSLADE Is that okay, if she starts? 

00:11:45
MICHELLE That's fine. 

00:11:45
Power of first speaker needs to be negotiated 

00:11:45
JOHN WINSLADE Is that okay? Okay. 

00:11:45
LISA Yes. 

00:11:45
JOHN WINSLADE Lisa. 

00:11:45
Lisa describes the problem story 

00:11:50
LISA I've been working with, with, ah, Clark's family center for 12 years now and, uhm, you know, I like things to be around a certain way and, uhm, she has been with this now for six months and, uhm, trying to make changes and I guess I'm not comfortable with these changes over using new ideas and you know - 

00:12:05
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:12:05
LISA - it's just not the way I'm used to running things. 

00:12:10
JOHN WINSLADE So, you been there-- what did you say 12 years? 

00:12:15
LISA Twelve years. 

00:12:15
JOHN WINSLADE And Michelle has been here six months? 

00:12:20
LISA Six months. 

00:12:20
JOHN WINSLADE And, and so you have-- what you haven't been comfortable were there some changes that that she what-- Michelle has introduced? Is that what you mean? 

00:12:30
LISA Yeah. Well, like you know not been as responsible. I don't know if that's the word, but like there was an incident when they were on an outing and then she allowed two of the residents to hold hands and it just-- I wasn't uncomfortable with the whole situation, you know, I thought that she should recommended them, and instead she just ignored it. 

00:12:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:12:50
LISA That kind of stuff. 

00:12:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So it was that, that was the aspect of this outing and this is where difference appeared between you. 

00:12:55
LISA Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:12:55
JOHN WINSLADE The hand that - 

00:12:55
LISA That holding hands. 

00:12:55
JOHN WINSLADE - holding hands, right? 

00:13:00
LISA The beginning, yeah, and I just. 

00:13:00
JOHN WINSLADE That was the beginning? 

00:13:00
LISA Yeah, when, when I knew I was gonna have or when I thought that that was conflict or you know I don't know. I just-- I don't like the way she took care of or handle that situation. So... 

00:13:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. And there may be some other things that you can come back to can I just ask - 

00:13:15
LISA Yeah. 

00:13:15
JOHN WINSLADE - Michelle a little bit? 

00:13:15
LISA Uh-hmm. 

00:13:15
JOHN WINSLADE So from your point of view Michelle how this whole thing developed between you both, the differences that have issue. 

00:13:20
2nd speaker responds to 1st speaker 

00:13:25
MICHELLE Well, I think Lisa is hoping her conclusion because the-- we work in a home with adults and there are 19, 20, 21 and 22 years old - 

00:13:35
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:13:35
MICHELLE - and we were having an outing at a plaza and, uhm, Melissa and Trent(ph) they you know get along really well, they spend a lot of time together and they were holding hands, big deal? 

00:13:45
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:13:45
MICHELLE They are 19. 

00:13:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:13:50
MICHELLE I don't understand what the problem is. 

00:13:55
JOHN WINSLADE So, you don't understand the problem that Lisa sees with that, right? 

00:14:00
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. I don't think there is a problem with that. 

00:14:00
Invites 2nd speaker to tell story from her own perspective 

00:14:00
JOHN WINSLADE Can I ask you, you know what you've done is respond to the issue that Lisa ra-- raised? I'm wondering it is that, is that the-- from your perspective was that how to start, the differences between you or there other things as well? 

00:14:15
MICHELLE Uhm, You know, I-- it started ever since I got there. 

00:14:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:14:20
MICHELLE So... 

00:14:20
JOHN WINSLADE So, how did it start when you got there? 

00:14:25
MICHELLE Well, when I - 

00:14:25
Michelle describes the problem story 

00:14:25
JOHN WINSLADE What are the issues? 

00:14:25
MICHELLE - when I got there, six months ago, uhm, I thought it was a good idea if all of the adults in my home had like, uhm, sexual education and awareness because they had never had that in their-- in the home or the program or in school. And so, we had a trip to the doctor and they had a whole sexual education from the nurse and the doctor were talking about, uhm, even getting vaccines for STDs or they were talking about birth control, they were talking about different things and Lisa had a problem with that too. 

00:15:05
JOHN WINSLADE With are you taking them to this - 

00:15:05
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

00:15:05
JOHN WINSLADE - education session or not? 

00:15:05
MICHELLE Yeah, she had a problem with me taking them there. 

00:15:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So that's when it first started from you? 

00:15:10
MICHELLE I think so. 

00:15:15
JOHN WINSLADE Any other things that happened that led to this conflict between you? 

00:15:15
MICHELLE And then... 

00:15:15
JOHN WINSLADE Differences between you? 

00:15:20
MICHELLE Yeah. The outing that she was talking about, went to the plaza and Trent and Melissa(ph) they get-- like I said they get along really well, they were holding hands and she had a problem with that and then the most recent is the concert that I coordinated with the adults in my home. 

00:15:35
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:15:35
MICHELLE They are going to, uhm, perform for the community at the... 

00:15:40
JOHN WINSLADE Oh, really? 

00:15:40
MICHELLE Yeah, at the holiday at, uhm, the holiday, uhm, the concert and she has a problem with that too. 

00:15:45
JOHN WINSLADE So, tell me about those performance and the concert a little bit more that I can understand what this was about. 

00:15:50
MICHELLE Well, when we, when we had went to the plaza when Lisa was talking about Trent and Melissa(ph) holding hands, we found flyers about a concert and the people in the community could sign up - 

00:16:00
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:16:05
MICHELLE - and they could train and play instruments, they could sing, they-- they think its just a whole holiday gathering for the community. 

00:16:10
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:16:10
MICHELLE And I thought it would be really good way for the adults in our home to you know show their skill and their talents and have a good time just like one of them in the community, but Lisa thinks that that's not a good idea. 

00:16:25
Curiosity about meaning 

00:16:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, what was your, your sort of thinking about this? Tell me if you would like you know why was that that this appeal to you this idea, I mean I'm not questioning what you did, I'm just interested to know. 

00:16:35
MICHELLE Well, I ever since I've been there I noticed that the adults in our home are segregated from the whole community. 

00:16:45
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:16:45
MICHELLE It's almost like I feel like we're trying to, trying to hide them from, from the community and I don't-- I just want to integrate them into, you know, everything. I mean I don't know why we have to keep them aside and separate. We should, we should have them integrated into the, the parades and the concerts and they should be able to go on outings with the neighbors and the other young adults and just my perspective is why keep them away, why hide them from everyone else? 

00:17:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, is that like a value that's important to you, uhm, about not hiding people with the disabilities away? 

00:17:25
MICHELLE Yeah. Because they're, I mean they're people too. They have, they have personalities, they have strengths, they have talents, they have hobbies, they have things that they wanna do just like every other young adult. Uh-hmm. 

00:17:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:17:40
MICHELLE I think we should give them the chance to experience that and integrate them with, with all other typical people. 

00:17:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Is that value one that, I mean I just didn't in knowing you're relationship with that is a strong value because it sounds like it's quite important to you. And as it being some, you've always believed or is it? Or what, you know? 

00:18:00
MICHELLE I, I think I've always believed that, but you know through school I just graduated in June - 

00:18:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:18:10
MICHELLE - and being in school... 

00:18:10
JOHN WINSLADE Congratulations! 

00:18:10
MICHELLE Thank you. 

00:18:10
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:18:10
MICHELLE And you Know I, I've read a lot of articles and I've read a lot of books and it shows the perspective that I agree with is that we should integrate people with disabilities with typical people - 

00:18:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:18:25
MICHELLE - and they shouldn't be sheltered away or they shouldn't be hidden and I think it will help them to grow a lot more in their skills and they can reach their potential, if we, if we help them to be around other people. 

00:18:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, okay. 

00:18:40
MICHELLE And Lisa, she thinks that there is just something completely wrong with that. 

00:18:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, do you mind if I just come back to Lisa or ask her some more questions? 

00:18:50
MICHELLE Sure. 

00:18:50
JOHN WINSLADE Is that okay? 

00:18:50
JOHN WINSLADE Yes Lisa, you said before, uhm, that there was this issue around the outing, uhm, in that that's where things started and Michelle is kind of mentioned a few other issues and I'm just wondering whether there's more of the, ah, you can explain about you know, how those conflict has developed between you. The differences between-- with if there have to be another issues as far you are concerned or I guess I'm just understood in your perspective of that with more? 

00:19:20
LISA Well, like I said I've been here a long time - 

00:19:20
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:19:20
LISA - and that's the just the, you know, policy as we, we don't encourage our residents to get involved with each other or start relationships. And, uhm, that's we... 

00:19:30
JOHN WINSLADE So when you say policy, I mean like what do you mean? Is that a... 

00:19:35
MICHELLE But you know what I checked that out and there isn't a policy on that. 

00:19:40
LISA But that's just the way we do things - 

00:19:40
JOHN WINSLADE That's the way... 

00:19:40
LISA - we just don't encourage. We don't encourage our residents that are living in our home to start relationships right at there. Whether we want them to maybe work on life skills and you know work on their selves not to start relationships. 

00:19:55
MICHELLE But relationships - 

00:19:55
LISA That's not we are there for. 

00:19:55
MICHELLE - is a life skill. 

00:19:55
JOHN WINSLADE And do you want kind of just ask a bit more - 

00:20:00
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:20:00
Interrupts performance of problem story 

00:20:00
JOHN WINSLADE - of this because I'll come back and, and cuz I make-- I wanna make sure that-- I mean what's important to her to share. So, uhm, that's, that's something that was important to you because you describe it as a policy or the way that we do things - 

00:20:15
LISA Uh-hmm. 

00:20:15
JOHN WINSLADE - or something that-- it sounds like something that you are committed to. 

00:20:20
LISA Yes, I'm committed to the residents and I want them to develop skills that are going to get them going on a great path to being successful adults who are out there - 

00:20:25
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:20:25
LISA - and not get caught up in relationships and get sidetracked or distracted and that's important to me is with them as they're focused. 

00:20:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, tell me more about how these the, the problem that has developed? How, how did it develop as far as you are concerned when you describe some of those values that are important to you and some of the policies or, or why is it doing things that are important, but tell me more about how this is the differences between you developed into an argument or conflict or I don't know what you would call up? 

00:20:55
LISA Well, I'm just trying, trying to, uhm, keep the residents focused and I just feel that she, uhm, Michelle is going behind my back and just doing things her way and not, not trying to, uhm, you know, go with the way it's been all this time, I've always told the residents to not start relationships here and it's like it's been overlooked and, uhm, you know it's a perfect example they were on outing and she just overlooked them pulling hands and I don't like it. I don't like the way it started or I don't... 

00:21:30
Externalizing 

00:21:30
JOHN WINSLADE So that-- has that, has that been-- has that difference about how things are done - 

00:21:40
LISA Uh-hmm. 

00:21:40
JOHN WINSLADE - is that been expressed in anything else if you're mentioning this one incident, but I want you to say more truth in that one incident. 

00:21:45
LISA Well, she mentioned that that, uhm, the residents are being, ah, hidden. I wouldn't call it hidden or you know segregated from the community. I, I just feel that's just I don't want to protect them, you know, you know, we, we are a family and, uhm, we go places together and I just want the residents to see that we're family not possible dating material or, you know, friendships it's just the family, we're a family. 

00:22:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:22:15
LISA And, and I just want to protect them from (inaudible ). 

00:22:21
JOHN WINSLADE So it's just the word family kind of suggests some values of how you got back in work that are important to you - 

00:22:25
LISA Yes, yes. 

00:22:25
JOHN WINSLADE - I mean I'm wondering. Tell me about that. 

00:22:30
LISA Yeah. Families, I value family and relationships, uhm, and I just don't want it to be taken out of context and just, you know, you start let them hold hands, what's next before, you know, she's gonna, you know encourage them to, I don't know, I don't know. I'm just not comfortable with this situation. I don't. 

00:22:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. And in the, in the sort of family environments that you have with this that you have been wanting to have and to live alone. 

00:22:50
LISA And we've managed to maintain for many years. 

00:22:55
JOHN WINSLADE And when you say, we, meaning? 

00:22:55
LISA The stuff. 

00:22:55
JOHN WINSLADE The stuff. Okay. And what, what is been your role in that? Tell me about that you've been doing, uhm, that is about expressing that idea. 

00:23:05
LISA Well, I guess it was staff meeting as I, I continuously remind the staff, you know that's a no, no, I don't encourage it, I don't, you know, I want them to stay focused. Uhm... 

00:23:20
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:23:20
LISA I, I don't like-- I can't keep anything up right now. 

00:23:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, when did you first sort of experienced this difference between you. Was that at the time of that outing or was it before that? 

00:23:30
Externalizing 

00:23:35
LISA I would like what she said from the very beginning. 

00:23:35
JOHN WINSLADE From the very beginning. 

00:23:35
LISA She came in and she was so probably in ready to go and make changes and you know maybe had she done it a little differently, maybe I would have been open to see the change, but it was so, you know, this is sudden for me and, and, you know. 

00:23:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. I mean... 

00:23:55
LISA And then this concert that she is, she is coordinating, you know, we hadn't really talked about it, I haven't officially approved it. 

00:24:00
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:24:00
LISA And, uhm, I don't think that the, that the residents are, are, uhm, capable or should be out there, you know, in an environment that they, they won't feel safe. That's my concern. 

00:24:15
JOHN WINSLADE That's your concern that, that - 

00:24:15
LISA Yes. 

00:24:20
JOHN WINSLADE - they would not feel safe. 

00:24:20
LISA Yes. And all the people coming and stopping to look and, you know, I'm just concerned. 

00:24:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Has there been any other things or may I just wanna make sure, a bit of clear picture of what's been going on and, what are, what are the issues between you? 

00:24:35
LISA Well the whole sexual-- the whole sexuality class that she brought in, you know, uhm, right after that, she knew I didn't like it like I really didn't care for it all and she took, uhm, one of the girls, uhm, to get some HPV, is that, is that what it was? HPV tester or, you know, series and... 

00:24:55
JOHN WINSLADE Immunization. 

00:24:55
LISA Yeah. 

00:24:55
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:24:55
LISA I'm not, I'm not really, you know, uhm, familiar with the whole thing, but I just know that you know if she's gonna do that, what's next? Is she going to be encouraging them to, you know, they're telling I'm just not comfortable with those situations. 

00:25:10
JOHN WINSLADE And you're concerned about the direction of that might be. 

00:25:10
LISA Yes. And, and her parents and the resident's parents you know how they gonna prove about, about that and she consult the parents and you know. 

00:25:20
JOHN WINSLADE And is that something you've talked about between you whether that the - 

00:25:20
LISA After the fact. 

00:25:25
JOHN WINSLADE - consultation issue or after the fact? 

00:25:25
LISA After the fact. 

00:25:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Do you, do you two kind of work together at the same time or you kind of... 

00:25:35
MICHELLE Not usually. We usually overlap and sometimes, I mean I might see her when she is coming in or I might have a little bit of time to work with in the middle of this. 

00:25:40
LISA Staff meeting or so. 

00:25:45
JOHN WINSLADE So, you, your work overlaps? 

00:25:45
LISA Overlaps, yeah. 

00:25:45
JOHN WINSLADE And it coincides, does it? 

00:25:45
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

00:25:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Uhm, have, ah,-- I'm just wanna be clear, ah, have you had a chance to put it out what are the main issues between you or is there anything else? 

00:26:00
LISA Maybe we haven't. I, I don't know. I just I-- I'm just not comfortable with her coming in and just trying to make change right away. I think you know I had been here long enough to know how I like things round and I don't know... 

00:26:20
JOHN WINSLADE So making change right away is part of the issue. 

00:26:20
LISA That would be my biggest-- for me, yeah. 

00:26:25
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Okay. 

00:26:25
LISA It was so instant and so sudden you know I don't work well like that. 

00:26:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, what would you say? 

00:26:30
MICHELLE Well, the thing is the, the adults that we work with they're not severely handicapped. I mean they're not severely disabled, there is no reason why they should be in such a restricted environment. 

00:26:45
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:26:45
MICHELLE I mean, she's talking about protecting them and keeping them here and, and you know it's like why I mean their-- the disability is so mild. I believe that they could be integrated into the community and if we want to teach them basic life skills and we want to teach them how to live in function, then we should expose them to everything that regular young adults that are exposed to you. And typically, young adults get sexual education typically young adults go to concerts, typical young adults have relationships and everyone want to learn life skills, why not teach them the whole thing. 

00:27:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:27:20
MICHELLE And it's that of restricting they've been only giving them part of it, you know, I don't think it's really benefiting them. 

00:27:25
Externalizing 

00:27:30
JOHN WINSLADE So, is this, is this right that this kind of difference in philosophy - 

00:27:35
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

00:27:35
JOHN WINSLADE - about how you work, how you come, think of the work that you do? You both nodding, is that right? 

00:27:40
MICHELLE Yeah. It's very different. 

00:27:40
Naming the problem story Tension is a name for the conflict 

00:27:40
JOHN WINSLADE So, uhm, how would you-- so I'm just making a note here, it's like there's difference of philosophy that's emerging is-- a description of what we're dealing, dealing with. Has it, I mean I'm interested in what you would call. I mean has emerged into an argument or a conflict or series of, uhm, discussions, I mean you know what would you say? What would you call? 

00:28:10
MICHELLE I think for me, its created tension. 

00:28:10
JOHN WINSLADE Tension. 

00:28:10
Conflict is another name 

00:28:10
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. And I've talked with Mr. Clark(ph) about it. I don't really feel like I can talk with her because she acts so domineering since she has been here for 12 years, it's almost like her way or the highway because I don't think she is even considering what I'm saying. 

00:28:25
JOHN WINSLADE So what are that has produced tension. 

00:28:30
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

00:28:30
LISA Conflict. 

00:28:30
JOHN WINSLADE Conflict. 

00:28:30
LISA Conflict. 

00:28:30
JOHN WINSLADE You call it conflict? 

00:28:35
LISA I call it conflict. 

00:28:35
JOHN WINSLADE Any other words that would-- we could use to describe what we hear to do with? 

00:28:40
MICHELLE Uhm... 

00:28:45
LISA You know it really bring in a lot of tension in the room when she walks in and, uhm, I don't want that to be-- I don't want the residents to catch on. So, I think that we should try to fix this before it's out of control. 

00:28:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:28:55
MICHELLE It also makes me feel guilty doing the right thing. And I believe that by putting them in at least restrictive environment and integrating them to-- into the community as good thing and I'm starting to feel guilty for doing that. That... 

00:29:10
JOHN WINSLADE So-- okay. So we've got this conflict and this difference of philosophy, this tension - 

00:29:15
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

00:29:15
Begins mapping the effects of the conflict story 

00:29:15
JOHN WINSLADE - whatever we're gonna quarter or it may be expressed at different times in different ways with different words like that. And you're starting to speak about some of the effects of that like it's may-- it kinds of gives you feeling guilty all the time. Is that right about things, which you believe that? 

00:29:35
MICHELLE Exactly. 

00:29:35
JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

00:29:35
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:29:35
JOHN WINSLADE What other effects is it having? Maybe if you Michelle come back and ask you that this tension or this conflict what affect is it having on you? 

00:29:40
MICHELLE Uhm, It's making me I wanna avoid her you know try to pay attention more when she is gonna come in or what times and not, not wanna be there. 

00:29:55
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:29:55
MICHELLE Maybe we could be on an outing that time when our shifts overlaps. 

00:30:00
JOHN WINSLADE And if the conflict and the tension won't there maybe you would-- wouldn't feel that - 

00:30:05
MICHELLE Right. 

00:30:05
JOHN WINSLADE - that you wanna avoid her, right? 

00:30:10
MICHELLE Right. 

00:30:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. What else she has been doing, any other affects that it's been having? I mean on you personally or on your relationship or... 

00:30:15
MICHELLE I have more ideas about what I want to do. 

00:30:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:30:20
MICHELLE I mean that's it's just what I have been able to do in, in the past six months, but its making me feel, uhm, a kind of discouraged that I don't know if my ideas in future are gonna be accepted. 

00:30:35
JOHN WINSLADE So discouraged about expressing or raising ideas that you had. 

00:30:40
MICHELLE Suggesting things to do. 

00:30:40
JOHN WINSLADE Suggesting ideas. Okay. Anything else? 

00:30:45
MICHELLE It's also making me feel angry. 

00:30:50
JOHN WINSLADE Angry? 

00:30:50
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

00:30:50
JOHN WINSLADE You mean while your work or it is a component and you feel angry afterwards or what? 

00:30:55
MICHELLE Yeah, I mean when I'm, when I'm with, when I'm with, uhm, adults in home I feel happy because that's what I want to do, but then when I start thinking about it or, you know, the tension grows and it makes me angry because I do believe that this is best practice. And, and I just, that just makes me mad that she can see that. 

00:31:15
JOHN WINSLADE So one of these effects of all the tension and the conflict is that it gets you angry when you think about it, when you're-- like when you go home and stuff. 

00:31:20
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:31:25
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, what about you and is there one of the-- some of the effects of this whole tension of this conflict on you? 

00:31:35
LISA It was very upsetting and... 

00:31:35
JOHN WINSLADE Upsetting? 

00:31:35
LISA Uh-hmm. And, uhm, I try not take work home with me, but for the last few weeks I having really hurt on sleeping and, uhm, I want to understand where she is come from by thinking maybe if she had approach me differently or prepare me that would be easier to work with, uhm, it's, It's... 

00:32:00
Effects are ascribed to the externalized problem 

00:32:00
JOHN WINSLADE It's like, it's like you had some that sounds like some, some good intentions here, some positive intentions here. You wanna be out of work with her and it's like this all conflict of this tension almost takes you away from what you really like to be doing, which is to work with her and work, having good working relationships. Is that what you are saying? Is that - 

00:32:20
LISA Yes. 

00:32:20
JOHN WINSLADE - have I got that right? 

00:32:20
LISA Yes. I don't wanna come off as being overprotective or over, you know, I, I just-- that's I guess my personal. I, I just-- I don't mean to be very motherly or... 

00:32:30
JOHN WINSLADE So it's important to you not to come across, uhm, as protective, as overprotective? 

00:32:40
LISA Yeah, overprotective or, or overbearing to the residents because they are over the age of 18 and I do want them to develop life skills but there is just a way we do it, there is ways around it so. 

00:32:50
JOHN WINSLADE So I write an understanding than the what this one thing as conflict is doing over the tension. 

00:33:00
LISA Uh-hmm. 

00:33:00
JOHN WINSLADE Is it kind of as you're concerned about how you are coming across - 

00:33:00
LISA Uhm. 

00:33:05
JOHN WINSLADE - both to Michelle and to the residents. 

00:33:05
LISA Uh-hmm. Exactly. 

00:33:05
JOHN WINSLADE Right and maybe it's kind of distorting that you feel, that you're concerned that it's distorting how you come across. 

00:33:15
LISA I think it is. It is distorting. I don't wanna them to think that. 

00:33:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Uhm. Anything else that you would say that this whole situation with the tension and the conflict, ah, what, anything else that you can say that's having an effect on as far as you are concerned? 

00:33:35
LISA Uhm, I, I'm not really sure but you know I, I don't, I don't think that I should avoid it because we do need to meet, we should meet, you know, at least three times a week and to brief the day and, uhm, I tend to avoid her too, but I, I need to, you know, I hope that we can resolve this. 

00:33:55
JOHN WINSLADE Right, right. 

00:33:55
LISA I really do. That's, that's... 

00:33:55
JOHN WINSLADE So your preference would be to not avoid her. 

00:34:00
LISA Right. 

00:34:00
JOHN WINSLADE And to resolve things. 

00:34:00
LISA Resolve things. 

00:34:00
JOHN WINSLADE But when the conflict as it were, it just sort of takes you away from what you really prefer to be happening. 

00:34:05
LISA Right. 

00:34:05
JOHN WINSLADE Is that fair? 

00:34:05
LISA Exactly, yes. You are right. It makes sense. 

00:34:10
JOHN WINSLADE So both of us thinks that if you... 

00:34:10
LISA Uh-hmm. 

00:34:15
JOHN WINSLADE Is this-- can I ask about-- is this issue, the, the tension and the conflict, has it affected the other people you know that are in your place the-- I think I'm, I'm wondering for other staff or whether it's affected the residents? Has it affected what else? 

00:34:30
MICHELLE I think it's affected the residents because I think that when we are saying that they shouldn't be allowed to go on outings or have a relationship or be in a concert, we're somehow telling them that they are not good enough or they are not like the rest of their community and you know what, what is that gonna do them later when they realize that they need to be excluded from these things. 

00:34:55
JOHN WINSLADE So are they responding to that at the moment in any way? I mean are you, are you seeing any effects of the tension between you two on them right now? I mean you're, you're describing that it could become like that but... 

00:35:05
MICHELLE You know, I've heard Trent and Melissa staying, you know, that they would be really sad if they didn't get that to hang out with one another. 

00:35:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:35:15
Widens the inquiry into the effects 

00:35:15
MICHELLE Or you know I heard Gabriel saying he will be really sad if he didn't get to, you know, play the guitar in the concert and you know they've been working so hard to this and Lisa just wants to take it away from them. 

00:35:25
LISA That's the one I am trying to do. I'm trying to take it away. I just want to go about it the right way and make sure all being covered and, and their safeties. 

00:35:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So have you noticed any effects of the conflict between you two on them? 

00:35:40
LISA I think so. They-- I've been a long, long time and I think they can sense some, some, uhm, tension when we're both in the room, especially when she is not giving the eye contact or you know stuff like that I am sure they feel that. 

00:35:55
Mapping the future effects of the conflict 

00:36:00
JOHN WINSLADE I'm just wondering you know it sounds like things have got quite difficult for you both, right? And I mean on hearing in a way both of you say that you prefer that this wasn't being at these, these tensions, but what if they would continue? What if they would get worse? What would that-- where would that leave you both? 

00:36:15
MICHELLE It'll be horrible because I really, really love my job and I wanna stay there and I love the residents, I love what I do and it would just be horrible if I had to keep fighting or justifying why I want to integrate them into the community. 

00:36:35
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. So you really prefer to be able to have an environment we, we aren't fighting. 

00:36:40
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

00:36:40
JOHN WINSLADE Right? 

00:36:40
LISA You're right. 

00:36:40
JOHN WINSLADE And you agree? 

00:36:40
LISA I, I, I would like to keep the peace and make it comfortable for everybody. 

00:36:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Do you have any sense of-- if this was to keep on going though, would it keep, keep on getting worse, what would happen? 

00:36:50
LISA It would be very uncomfortable. 

00:36:55
JOHN WINSLADE Very uncomfortable. 

00:36:55
LISA For myself and for the residents. 

00:37:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. And would that be sustainable for very long or not? I mean you're both saying the same thing that it would be very uncomfortable, it'd be very horrible, it's a word you used, right? 

00:37:10
MICHELLE If it keeps going, I mean, I don't know how I build the standard and I don't wanna leave. 

00:37:20
JOHN WINSLADE You don't wanna leave, right. And would that be similar for you? 

00:37:20
LISA Yeah, I think she has some great ideas and I, I don't wanna see her go either but... 

00:37:25
JOHN WINSLADE You don't? 

00:37:30
LISA No. 

00:37:30
JOHN WINSLADE So, uhm, would it be fair? I mean you've both spoken about a number of the effects of this problem and you've both spoken about how it affects you personally, how it's affecting others, how it could get worse and create, you know, an even more uncomfortable situation if you didn't deal with it. Is that right? Is that fair enough? 

00:37:50
LISA It's true. 

00:37:50
Invites parties to evaluate the problem & its effects 

00:37:50
JOHN WINSLADE Are you kind of-- I guess I'm hearing you both side. I just wanna check this. Are you happy that it keeps going on there or would you-- I mean I'm hearing you both sides you really wanted to change and I just want to be sure about that. 

00:38:05
MICHELLE I do. 

00:38:05
LISA I do. I want. 

00:38:10
JOHN WINSLADE You both do. 

00:38:10
MICHELLE Something has to be changed. 

00:38:10
LISA I want us to be able to work together, not you know be the best friends, but be able to be civil and work side by side and understand. 

00:38:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So you're both really wanting things to change, right? 

00:38:25
MICHELLE Right. 

00:38:25
JOHN WINSLADE And you? 

00:38:25
LISA Yeah, I would agree, yes. I want some change. 

00:38:25
JOHN WINSLADE And-- yeah. And you want, uhm, something to be different in the relationship between you? 

00:38:35
LISA Yes. 

00:38:35
Inquiring into the preferred story 

00:38:35
JOHN WINSLADE And I, I think I guess I'd like to know what you would like. I mean if you just give me not necessarily the detail of what, what would be happening, but what would the relationship between you be like if it would be-- if it would be how you prefer. Can you tell me a bit more about that? 

00:38:55
LISA I, I would, I would want for her to come to me, throw these ideas out at me, let me kind of think them through a little and, and then slowly get to that point. That's all I am asking. It's just prepare me, you know come to me, talk to me, not just go behind my back. That, that's what I want. 

00:39:15
JOHN WINSLADE So for you, for you the relationship would be one way you are talking more to each other. 

00:39:20
LISA Yes, talking more. 

00:39:25
JOHN WINSLADE And you will have some time to sort of think things through. 

00:39:25
LISA Uh-hmm. 

00:39:25
JOHN WINSLADE That's what would be, would make a difference for you. 

00:39:30
LISA I know it would. I think it would. 

00:39:30
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. What about you? What, what would-- how would you describe the relationship is gonna be, how you want to prefer? 

00:39:40
MICHELLE For me the most important thing is the best thing for the residents - 

00:39:45
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:39:45
MICHELLE - and so if they had the best quality of life that they had when they were in the home with us, then I think that would help improve our relationship. 

00:39:55
JOHN WINSLADE See you are interested in the results of what's happening and that if you see those things happening - 

00:40:00
MICHELLE Right. 

00:40:00
JOHN WINSLADE - what difference would that make to your relationship? 

00:40:05
MICHELLE I think indirectly it would just, the tension would go away, if I know that they can go on outings and they can be a part of concerts and be a part of community, then all that anger and resentment and guilt I don't, don't see it being there anymore. 

00:40:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So for you, what would be different would be, uhm, that there would be a relationship that has less tension and the anger and guilt would not be there? 

00:40:30
MICHELLE Right. 

00:40:30
Seeking out unique outcomes 

00:40:30
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Uhm, and, uhm, I guess I'm wondering after being some occasions which have been a little bit more like that you know I mean have there been some occasions when, uhm, you have had a chance to talk over some issues or whether tension has not felt strong? 

00:40:55
LISA Not really, I think, uhm, her avoidance and that, that's what's been present. So I, I think if she would maybe feel more comfortable with me, maybe she could come talk to me, I don't want her to feel uncomfortable when I'm in the room. 

00:41:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so avoidance is sort of like being in-charge of the situation between you, right? 

00:41:15
LISA Right, right. 

00:41:20
JOHN WINSLADE And you would prefer if, if it could be more like you were talking to each other? 

00:41:20
LISA It would be a team. We will not be affected to our residents, so we need to be a team in order to you know set them. 

00:41:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:41:30
LISA And, and I don't wanna, I don't wanna think that out of their best interest in mind, I definitely do. I just, ah... 

00:41:40
JOHN WINSLADE So when you said it'd be a team, can you tell me more about what that would look like I mean if you were to see it? 

00:41:45
LISA Well, the activity is going to be planned and, and advanced. 

00:41:50
JOHN WINSLADE Planned activities. 

00:41:50
LISA Uh-hmm. 

00:41:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:41:50
LISA And advanced and, and discussed and, and make sure that everybody has a good idea of what, what will be taken by each other and, uhm, you know some of the dos and don'ts that, that had been taking place for the last so many years if she would just respect that you know maybe question it later, but just respect for that moment. 

00:42:10
JOHN WINSLADE So respect for how things have been done in the past? 

00:42:15
LISA Right and, and, and change should come and should happen. You know, it is the different year of time, but not overnight. 

00:42:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:42:25
LISA It takes some time. 

00:42:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. I mean, I'm trying to get a sense of-- have you ever discussed things? I mean, I mean presumably you must, you must have had some conversation between you, right? I mean have there been times when you have discussed any things, any activities for example? 

00:42:40
MICHELLE Well, I know there was, uhm, there was some one time where it was, there wasn't that much tension. The residents are home I volunteered at sea seafood restaurant in the mornings... 

00:42:55
JOHN WINSLADE Oh, really. 

00:42:55
MICHELLE And they cleaned silverware and they wrapped them and there was residents from other homes that they meet with and they are considered colleagues and we talk about that, then we seem to agree and everything is okay, but it's just when we talk about events where it's not our special like special Olympics or special people, then that's when the tension seems to come in. 

00:43:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:43:15
MICHELLE But if they are around people with disabilities, then she is okay with that and mostly we'll get along. 

00:43:25
JOHN WINSLADE So how does that fit with your experience with those conversations? 

00:43:25
LISA Well I agree with her. she's right. We had less tension but again that was a planned activity. I, I was prepared where they were going I was prepared, what their task is gonna be, ah, I had a better sense of what was going on. But when things happen so suddenly, I, I, I don't do well. I don't work well I guess. So I just wanted to learn that piece about me. You know she wants to work effectively get to know and how I work well, you know just prepare me and, and it was a great... 

00:43:55
JOHN WINSLADE So you're trying to know what would go into the discussion? 

00:44:00
LISA Yes, yes. 

00:44:00
JOHN WINSLADE Would it involve that kind of time and that preparation and that explanation and that kind of thing? 

00:44:05
LISA And there was a wonderful idea that she brought it. She said that up but it was the way she did it up and I totally approved the way she you know did that one particular activity. 

00:44:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So at that time how was the relationship between you? 

00:44:20
MICHELLE That was okay. 

00:44:20
JOHN WINSLADE It was okay? 

00:44:25
LISA Much better than lately. 

00:44:25
JOHN WINSLADE Than lately? 

00:44:25
LISA Lately, yes. 

00:44:30
JOHN WINSLADE And it's like what's happened since has been avoidance and tension and those kind of things just - 

00:44:35
LISA Uh-hmm. 

00:44:35
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

00:44:35
JOHN WINSLADE - come in. I mean what I am interested in is you both have different ways of describing what's been different because you say it's been more about how you talk about things or don't talk about the more how you've been taken into count or whether you've been respected. And for you it's been about, about the topic. 

00:44:55
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:44:55
JOHN WINSLADE That's been the difference. 

00:44:55
MICHELLE If there were, if there were other people with disabilities, then everything is okay. As soon as I wanna integrate them then it goes like a fate. 

00:45:05
JOHN WINSLADE So the topic makes a difference to producing a fine. 

00:45:10
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:45:15
JOHN WINSLADE How does that sound to you? Does that-- I mean, is that, is that how you understood it? 

00:45:20
LISA Maybe I've had a little more easier times when they are with, with the other people because that's, that's the way it was natural. That's what, we've always done it and there was an activity that's planned or whatever but it's the new stuff I am having problems with and I, I, I wanna change that. I, I do want allow her to come in and bring in new things but I just... 

00:45:40
JOHN WINSLADE So you know something, you're completely closed off to the ideas that Michelle is wanting to bring? 

00:45:45
LISA Right. I wanted to see that, now I am not closed up, but it's, it's just the way it's brought to me. That's, that's what the conflict is, is that, I want us to both be on a same page. You know I want us to both to go in at the same rate, not her go you know. 

00:46:00
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:46:00
LISA You know, around my back program. That's it. 

00:46:05
JOHN WINSLADE So... 

00:46:10
LISA And I, I agree I think that residents should be integrated with the community. I mean we live in a community where it, it doesn't say anything about color but we're living outdoors we live, we're part of the community I believe that's important. I just-- the way I work I guess is what I, you know... 

00:46:25
Inquiring into significance of a unique outcome 

00:46:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. You're concerned that it wasn't gonna be possible to have a conversation about some of these new ideas. I mean and I'm wondering now, that in the, uhm, what you are hearing, what she's saying at the moment? This sounds any different? What-- I mean what you're hearing? 

00:46:45
MICHELLE It sounds a lot of different than what I have been hearing in the last six months because it seems like... 

00:46:50
JOHN WINSLADE Is that a good difference? 

00:46:50
MICHELLE Yeah, it's a good difference. I'm hearing that she's willing to at least consider something new. 

00:46:55
Growing the story of difference 

00:47:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. And so does that-- is that helpful for you in any way? 

00:47:05
MICHELLE That's helpful. It gives me hope that, uhm, maybe she will accept my ideas if we talk about it. 

00:47:10
JOHN WINSLADE What kind of hope would you see growing as a result of what she just said? 

00:47:20
MICHELLE It makes me think that maybe one of us, uhm, wanna have to leave to solve the problem. But we can work together and we can both talk about new ideas for the future. 

00:47:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:47:30
MICHELLE Without any conflict. 

00:47:30
Working between parties to grow the counter story 

00:47:35
JOHN WINSLADE What's it like for you to hear that Michelle is having more hope? 

00:47:40
LISA It's really, uhm, I, I don't like her style. I don't like who she is. The, the residents truly love her. 

00:47:45
JOHN WINSLADE Do they? You've noticed that? 

00:47:45
LISA Obviously, I've noticed it yeah, but her attitude beats up on everybody and - 

00:47:50
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:47:50
LISA You know maybe it will beat up on me and you know, uhm, I just-- it makes me feel good, but she's still willing to work with me and my team. That makes me feel good. 

00:48:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So does that make a difference to maybe how you can talk about things from your perspective? 

00:48:10
Reflexive inquiry 

00:48:15
LISA Yeah, it makes a difference, uhm, I'm, I'm not sure. 

00:48:20
JOHN WINSLADE You are not sure. 

00:48:20
LISA Uh-hmm. What you're... 

00:48:25
JOHN WINSLADE What I am asking. 

00:48:25
LISA Yes. 

00:48:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:48:25
LISA So... 

00:48:25
JOHN WINSLADE I mean what responding to was to your earlier comments about, uhm, you know some of the difficulties of talking about things and, and for you the importance of, uhm, being respected in those conversations in given time and to adjust to new ideas - 

00:48:45
LISA Uh-hmm. 

00:48:45
JOHN WINSLADE - uhm, and I guess I was wondering with, ah, as you heard, Michelle expressed some hope for something better between you whether that sounds, it sounds like something that can make a difference to your experience of those conversations. 

00:49:00
LISA I think it does and it will. It will be a positive difference. Uhm. I don't want her to, to avoid me. I, I want her to keep her ideas growing, come in and just I guess the way she approaches me is important. 

00:49:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So if I can just take you back to where we started, uhm, you know at the start you both said some things about what you would like this conversation be about and I'd just like to check how this is going in regard to those things. Is that okay? 

00:49:35
LISA Uh-hmm. 

00:49:35
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:49:35
JOHN WINSLADE You said that you wanted to be heard and listened to and feeling and you wanted to feel understood. I mean how are we doing it in terms of creating that kind of conversation? What's happening? How we are doing in that regard? 

00:49:50
MICHELLE I feel like she understands me a lot more today than she has in the past six months, so it's nice. 

00:49:55
JOHN WINSLADE What do you say? 

00:50:00
LISA And, and it's nice to know that she is willing to understand how I've gotten really comfortable with, with the program that's been 12 years and, and then maybe still understand what I'm open to, to some new ideas and... 

00:50:15
Relationship story is now different 

00:50:15
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:50:15
LISA I just want that. That's my problem. 

00:50:15
JOHN WINSLADE Can I just ask her about that a little bit more? 

00:50:20
LISA Okay. 

00:50:20
JOHN WINSLADE I mean Lisa said several times that she would like you to understand her possession given that she's been here 12 years and that, uhm, you know, uhm, she's got some things that are important to her and you know I'm just wondering you know whether you have any response that you'd like to offer her in response to that? 

00:50:40
MICHELLE Well, I mean I appreciate that you know she has been there for 12 years and she's up there to change things. I didn't really see it that way that it was changing, everything I saw like I'm just doing my job and I, I want the best for the residents and I did it really... 

00:51:00
JOHN WINSLADE So is it sort of new information for you here that way? 

00:51:00
MICHELLE Yeah, it is. 

00:51:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. What difference does that new information make perhaps to how you might talk? 

00:51:10
MICHELLE Well I guess before I just assumed she was trying to take away that concert and she just wanted to hide them, but I guess now I realize that it's more about change than it is about not wanting the best for them. 

00:51:25
JOHN WINSLADE So what difference does that like for example to have you might work together? 

00:51:30
MICHELLE No our relation is not being completely malicious to the residents because one day we're sad about not being able to participate in the concert. You know I was thinking how could she do that, but, but now I realize okay she's not trying to take it away from them it was more about - 

00:51:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Uhm, okay. 

00:51:50
MICHELLE - keeping things traditional I guess. 

00:51:50
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

00:51:55
LISA Maybe just having a little more, ah, clear vision of what this concert's going to look like and, you know, that's, that's all I was asking. It's you know to kind of run it through me before and I am open, I am easy. Just, just, just you have to get to know me. 

00:52:05
Opening up negotiation of agreement 

00:52:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So you also spoke both of you earlier about the need to resolve some issues and reach some agreements so that you can move on in the relationship in the way that you've described. And I'm wondering you know what needs to be resolved? Or as you sit and think about things now, I mean you get a chance to talk about, uhm, the kind of preferred relationship you would like to have, uhm, and you had some, you got some hopes about that. 

00:52:35
LISA Well... 

00:52:35
JOHN WINSLADE And you expressed some things. What, what's outstanding? What needs to be worked on? 

00:52:40
LISA Well, she has all these wonderful ideas and, and I like that and I respect that and maybe, you know, we're looking for an activities coordinator and maybe we can better have a job where she could bring these ideas, present them to me, we'll talk about it and work out the things and then we'll go forth, that, that would be a way that I could see that I can get to use her and her skills, her great ideas, but I still get to oversee, you know, get more concerns. 

00:53:10
JOHN WINSLADE Because of your role, you are the team leader. 

00:53:10
LISA Yes my role, yes I am. I need to make sure everybody's safeties and you know that's my best interest to make sure everybody is safe and how she is going to go about it and, and that's it. 

00:53:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So what do you need to agree on to ensure that that would happen? Now, I mean what do you need? What, what's possible to agree on now? 

00:53:35
LISA Just prepare me just you know... 

00:53:40
JOHN WINSLADE That's what you have been asking for several times right? 

00:53:40
LISA Yeah. Just, just give me some time to think the, the things through I mean I'll respond immediately like the next day, but I am given some thought and I'm open for some new ideas just, yeah. 

00:53:55
JOHN WINSLADE What, what do you see that would be useful for you to agree on that would help things go forward? 

00:54:00
MICHELLE Uhm, I guess incorporating, uhm, my ideas into the existing traditions that they have at the home. I mean I understand they have, you know, a lot of things that they do with other disabled adults. But as long as we can do some other events and other activities that involve typical people and typical families and... 

00:54:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So can I ask you to you know maybe even take a further step forward and detail this? Because I mean what you are saying is give me time and prepare me and I will consider these ideas and as long as you include me and give me that respect for my role, then I'm happy to talk through the ideas and get some agreements. That's what you're saying, right? 

00:54:55
LISA You said it perfect. I like that. 

00:54:55
JOHN WINSLADE And you are saying you could work together if as long as the well-said opportunity for you to incorporate your ideas and if your ideas to be incorporated into the, into the home? 

00:55:00
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:55:00
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. What's necessary in order for those two things to happen? 

00:55:10
LISA Maybe we can set aside some time once a week to just sit and planning the week activities. 

00:55:20
JOHN WINSLADE So time. 

00:55:20
LISA I think it would be helpful. 

00:55:20
JOHN WINSLADE A time to plan and, and have those conversations. 

00:55:25
LISA Uh-hmm. And it works her mind and she can bring these ideas up and... 

00:55:25
JOHN WINSLADE So that's one idea. What else, what other ideas might there be? 

00:55:30
MICHELLE , uhm, I guess when I am talking about ideas if she can continue being open like today instead of, uhm, you know, saying like this is the way we've always done it or this is our tradition and this is what we've done for years because, you know, times are changing and just because we've done it for 12 years it doesn't mean we have to do it that way for another 12, just be open-minded. 

00:55:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So what would she have to do for you to feel that she was being open-minded? 

00:56:00
MICHELLE Uhm, I guess listening and not interrupting me and closing the conversation before I have a chance to explain the entire idea. 

00:56:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Not interrupting, listening, not interrupting, uhm, chance to explain the whole idea. 

00:56:20
MICHELLE Right. Because part of it why she didn't know about the whole doctor outing and the whole concert because I don't usually get to explain all the details of it. 

00:56:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So you, you want to have a chance to explain things in full before you hear Lisa's reaction. 

00:56:35
MICHELLE Right. 

00:56:40
JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

00:56:40
MICHELLE Right. 

00:56:40
Brainstorming options 

00:56:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Okay, so let's forget about that. Anything else? Any other-- I just wanna give you a chance to put out any other thoughts you have, what can make a difference to you? 

00:56:50
MICHELLE And also if we could find out what's important to our residents because all the activities that are planned, no one ever considers what they wanna do and - 

00:57:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:57:05
MICHELLE - how Melissa and Trent and Gabriel(ph) and you know they all have talents with music and singing and dancing and no one considers, well they wanna to do for fun if we could do that too. 

00:57:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So you would like-- I mean is this for example associated with this meeting that you have that you have a chance - 

00:57:20
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

00:57:20
JOHN WINSLADE - to have that meeting to talk about what's important to them? 

00:57:20
MICHELLE Right. 

00:57:20
JOHN WINSLADE Or you're talking about some other way of finding out of what's important to them? 

00:57:25
MICHELLE I think that our meeting would be good if we could have an hour or so a week to talk about that. 

00:57:35
JOHN WINSLADE Any other ideas you you're contemplating about what can make a difference to you? 

00:57:40
LISA Uhm, yes, the meeting would be good in just coming an open-minded and, uhm, definitely let her speak and say everything she has to say before I do interrupt and close that idea because it's something new. 

00:58:00
JOHN WINSLADE So you're willing to do something different? 

00:58:00
LISA Yes. I am. Yes. 

00:58:00
JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? Can you tell me clearly I'd like to know? What are you, what are you willing to do differently that would enable that conversation to work? What are you offering? 

00:58:10
LISA Not interrupting. 

00:58:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So that's something that you both agree on. 

00:58:15
LISA Uh-hmm. 

00:58:15
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

00:58:15
JOHN WINSLADE Right. And you're willing to offer that. So you're understanding what she means when you say that you react more quickly to things that she said without her having a chance to - 

00:58:25
LISA Yeah. 

00:58:25
JOHN WINSLADE - express them fully. Okay. And you're willing to change, make some change in that regard? 

00:58:30
LISA Yes I can try not to-- or do my best to not interrupt while she is - 

00:58:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:58:35
LISA - presenting something new. That's what it is when some new ideas like well, you know, some, yeah, I'm letting... 

00:58:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, and you would like to have some time to think about it, right? 

00:58:45
LISA Yes, yes. 

00:58:45
JOHN WINSLADE And so you wouldn't want an instant decision, you wouldn't wanna be forced - 

00:58:50
LISA Yeah. 

00:58:50
JOHN WINSLADE - to an instant decision. 

00:58:50
LISA Right. Don't feel pressure that I have to make my mind up by then and there and that she comes in and this is okay and this is what I'd like to do, this would be great. The kids-- I've talked to the kids. The residents, they would love it. And what do you think and can we talk about this tomorrow? And then I have to go and you know think it through and then I can come back instead of just saying, you know, I don't work like that. 

00:59:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:59:10
LISA That's all. 

00:59:10
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. How does that sound to you? 

00:59:15
MICHELLE That sounds nice. I'll be willing to do that. I'm really pleased that, uhm, she said that because I didn't even think she would appreciate that. 

00:59:20
JOHN WINSLADE That's a new - 

00:59:20
MICHELLE That's right. 

00:59:20
JOHN WINSLADE - new information - 

00:59:20
MICHELLE Uh-huh. 

00:59:20
JOHN WINSLADE - for you again, right? 

00:59:25
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:59:25
JOHN WINSLADE And that's something you can work with? 

00:59:25
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:59:25
JOHN WINSLADE And you can see how you can work with it? 

00:59:30
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. Cuz I have a lot of ideas I'd like to share. 

00:59:30
An agreement is taking shape 

00:59:30
JOHN WINSLADE So we would have this, which, what we're taking about is a meeting that would happen once a week would involve a chance for I mean ideas from either of you I imagine to be talked about. 

00:59:40
LISA Uh-hmm. 

00:59:40
JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

00:59:45
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

00:59:45
JOHN WINSLADE And you would have a chance when you head up new ideas to talk about I mean in full without being interrupted and without hearing, uhm, Lisa's immediate reactions and you're willing to do that if you are given time to actually think through your responses without feeling pressured in the moment and you're willing to give her that time. 

01:00:05
MICHELLE Yeah. 

01:00:05
JOHN WINSLADE Anything else that needs to be in place in order to say that we've kind of done what we needed to do here? 

01:00:10
MICHELLE I think what would be really important for me and the residents is if she came to one of the events for the outings. 

01:00:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:00:20
MICHELLE In that way the residents would feel like you know they were being supported by her. 

01:00:25
JOHN WINSLADE And you're thinking about the concert or you're thinking about something else? 

01:00:25
MICHELLE That would be really important. Yes, the concert will be a start. 

01:00:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:00:30
LISA I would love to be a part of that. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 

01:00:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So that's something that you, you can agree on to either. Is this concept or you are saying you're both gonna support the concert idea? 

01:00:45
LISA Yeah, we will talk some more about that, but I think it's, it's doable. I think that it's the best interest. I, I hear them practicing. They sound great. It's something new and why not start here. 

01:00:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So the concert may be part of your first conversation next week? 

01:01:00
LISA Yes. 

01:01:00
JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

01:01:00
LISA Yes. 

01:01:00
MICHELLE Yeah, I accept that. 

01:01:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So how are we doing here? How is this, how is this feeling like to you? 

01:01:15
MICHELLE Feeling lot better than I thought it would. 

01:01:15
JOHN WINSLADE Really? 

01:01:15
LISA Definitely. 

01:01:15
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

01:01:20
JOHN WINSLADE What do you, What do you appreciate about how this gone? 

01:01:20
MICHELLE Uhm, I guess those rules that you were talking about at the beginning, I, I wasn't sure how that would work in it. That's really made, made the difference. 

01:01:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. How is it going for you? 

01:01:35
Review is built into the agreement 

01:01:35
LISA I'm feeling a little more understood and, and that, uhm, I wasn't trying to attack her in any way, I was just trying to keep my position clear. 

01:01:45
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

01:01:50
LISA Uhm, and I'm actually excited, I'm excited to, to... 

01:01:50
JOHN WINSLADE Really? 

01:01:55
LISA Yeah. To see and hear more about these new ideas. 

01:01:55
JOHN WINSLADE So is it different than how you've been feeling? 

01:02:00
LISA Yes. 

01:02:00
JOHN WINSLADE What's different do you think about it? What's most different about it? 

01:02:05
LISA I guess-- I don't know, uhm, I feel more comfortable that I, I know now that she is not trying to, to make us change over all but that she is bringing in, you know she actually cares about these residents and that she does have their best interest in mind. 

01:02:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

01:02:25
LISA And, uhm... 

01:02:25
JOHN WINSLADE And that's something you can join? 

01:02:25
LISA Yeah, that's something I, I respect and - 

01:02:30
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

01:02:30
LISA - enjoy hearing about her. 

01:02:30
JOHN WINSLADE I guess we're nearly at a finish here right for we can do for the day. One thing I would just like to say is, uhm, you know, you, you've kind of got some ideas. I mean I am happy to write these up and give them to you by the way. The things you just agreed to about what how you will have this meeting. 

01:02:50
MICHELLE Okay. 

01:02:50
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, What I would like to do, if this is okay with you, is to check back, uhm, in a couple of weeks about how this has been going. 

01:03:00
LISA I would like that. 

01:03:00
JOHN WINSLADE You would? 

01:03:00
LISA Uh-hmm. 

01:03:00
JOHN WINSLADE Just because I mean it could go wrong, we don't know it, right? 

01:03:05
MICHELLE Yeah. 

01:03:05
LISA Yeah. 

01:03:05
MICHELLE Yeah, hopefully not. 

01:03:05
JOHN WINSLADE And, uhm, so I, I would do that. Now what do you need to tell Mr. Clark(ph) about all this because we said before that he would, uhm, you know, there may be some outcomes from this meeting that would be important to tell him. What, what, from what we talked about, what do you think it's important that he should know? 

01:03:25
LISA That we're both willing to respect each other's ideas and position, uhm, and that we are willing to, uhm, work as a team. 

01:03:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. You need to say it again you-- that you're both willing to respect each other's ideas. 

01:03:45
LISA Uh-hmm. 

01:03:50
JOHN WINSLADE And work as a team. 

01:03:50
MICHELLE And I think it's important for him to know that we're gonna meet an hour a week. 

01:03:55
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Going, uhm, to meet an hour a week. 

01:04:05
MICHELLE Because we might need coverage during that time. 

01:04:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Might need coverage in that time. What I'm just suggesting you, what I'd like to do is to put this in writing for you and give it to you and to-- I will give you a copy and, uhm, it's up to you then to decide how that gets to Mr. Clark(ph). I mean it's not my job to tell him, but I don't know whether you, as a team lead would or whether you would, uhm, show him the results and the outcome and, and you can let him know. Is that-- how does that sound? 

01:04:40
LISA I'll make sure he gets it. 

01:04:40
MICHELLE That's better. 

01:04:40
JOHN WINSLADE Certainly? 

01:04:40
MICHELLE Yeah. 

01:04:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. But I'd like to thank you for what you brought to this conversation both of you. It's been a joy to talk with you and I do really respect the commitment you both made to working together and producing what you described as teamship and respect a minute ago and it's a joy for me to see that. So thank you very much for... 

01:05:05
MICHELLE Thank you for helping us. 

01:05:05
LISA Thank you for helping us. 

01:05:05
JOHN WINSLADE You're most welcome. 

01:05:05
MICHELLE Thank you. 

01:05:10
JOHN WINSLADE And good luck. 

01:05:10
LISA Thank you. 

01:05:10
MICHELLE Thanks. 

01:05:10
JOHN WINSLADE And I'll see you again in two weeks. 

01:05:10
MICHELLE Okay. 

01:05:10
LISA Yes, probably. 

01:05:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay? 

01:05:15
LISA Okay. 

01:05:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay.

01:06:25
JOHN WINSLADE Hi, Michelle, hi Lisa nice to see you again. 

01:06:25
LISA Hi. 

01:06:25
MICHELLE Nice to see you. 

01:06:30
JOHN WINSLADE And it's been a couple of weeks and, uhm, I sent you a letter, did you get the letter? 

01:06:35
LISA Yes, thank you. 

01:06:35
MICHELLE Yeah we both got a copy of it. 

01:06:35
JOHN WINSLADE Great. And we-- in that letter I talked about things put, tried to put down the things that we talked about last time and I understand that you've been having some meetings, since then - 

01:06:45
LISA Uh-hmm. 

01:06:50
JOHN WINSLADE - and along the lines that we planned. 

01:06:50
LISA Uh-hmm. 

01:06:50
Inquiry into the development of the counter story 

01:06:50
JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, I guess I'm interested to find out how that's gone. 

01:06:55
MICHELLE Uhm, Actually our meetings they've gone pretty well, I think. 

01:07:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:07:00
MICHELLE Uhm, Lisa has been listening to some ideas that I have about the future and, uhm, she hasn't been interrupting me and she's been most-- for the most open-minded about what I was hoping to plan. 

01:07:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, the respect that we talked about last time the non-interrupting, working as a team as you're seeing(ph) at Michelle that's been happening 

01:07:25
MICHELLE Yes. 

01:07:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:07:25
MICHELLE That has been happening. 

01:07:25
JOHN WINSLADE How about for you Lisa? 

01:07:30
LISA Yeah, good respect is there. I, I feel respected now and, uhm, I've, I've actually enjoyed hearing her new ideas and - 

01:07:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:07:40
LISA - interrupting. Not interrupting has, has been pretty easy for me because she has lot of wonderful ideas. 

01:07:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So would you say the conversation between you has been the kind of what would hope for. 

01:07:50
LISA Yes much better, much better. 

01:07:50
The problem story still has life in it 

01:07:50
MICHELLE Yeah. Except there was at our last meeting there was one thing that we didn't, we couldn't seem to resolve at the concert, uhm, Melissa and Trent(ph) were holding hands when they were watching the other performances and Lisa was upset about that. 

01:08:10
JOHN WINSLADE So you've had this better conversation between you, but there's been an issue that has continued to persist here. 

01:08:15
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

01:08:15
LISA Uh-hmm. 

01:08:20
JOHN WINSLADE And it sounds like it was something that was upsetting for you and Lisa, do you want to say something about what upset you? 

01:08:25
LISA Well, uhm, in the past we've had an incident where a couple of residents, uhm, started a relationship and it caused so much chaos in the house, I mean other residents were uncomfortable, one had to eventually leave, it just-- it didn't work and that's my main concern. I understand these, these kids are young and they don't wanna be normal and have a normal life and I just-- it's not a good idea to have that in the house. 

01:08:55
JOHN WINSLADE To have - 

01:08:55
LISA Relationships? 

01:08:55
JOHN WINSLADE - what exactly? Relationships? 

01:08:55
LISA Relationships starting between the residents is just, it's not a good environment and it causes way to many problems. 

01:09:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:09:05
LISA And that's I and I felt to tell you about the past, you know, I should have told you about the story because it was nothing, but problems and, you know, right now, there are, there are to gain other skills besides relationships, so, you know, I hope you can understand that why? 

01:09:20
JOHN WINSLADE You want to speak about, you want to speak to? 

01:09:25
MICHELLE Well I, I mean I understand what she is saying, but at the same time they're, they're at the home to learn life skills and life's-- part of life skills are relationships and if they don't learn it in the home, then when they graduate from the program where they are going learn to have a, have an appropriate relationship with someone. 

01:09:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So you've got a-- had a, a different perspective - 

01:09:45
MICHELLE Yeah. 

01:09:45
JOHN WINSLADE - on this issue, right? Do you want to say it like, you know, how would you describe, I mean Lisa is saying what she describes the relationships that she would like in home to be like a family. How would you describe that kind of relationships that you would like to see given those ideas? 

01:10:05
MICHELLE Uhm, I mean I appreciate the family idea, but at the same time I believe that we're kind of like a community. And if, we're going to integrate into the community then they need to practice that in the home. So, I don't really see them as brothers and sisters and mom and dad that's more like we're representing what a community might look like. 

01:10:25
The problem is rooted in competing discourses 

01:10:25
JOHN WINSLADE So we've got these two notions, one of family and one of community, uhm, and want to-- I mean the word integration comes up under the heading of community. What, what do you see as the difference between community and family Lisa? 

01:10:45
LISA Well, my idea of family is, is, is you know we all work together for the-- towards the same goal, uhm, I, I don't see that being helpful, it just brings more issues and drama into the relationship with them developing a relationship, not to mention the other residents are very uncomfortable, very uncomfortable. When they had an argument the other day, you know, in the house, you know if they had not been in a relationship it wouldn't have had that issue. 

01:11:15
JOHN WINSLADE You mean, Trent and Melissa(ph) had an argument? 

01:11:15
LISA Yes. In front of the residents and it just, it just chaos and if we're a family, I mean you, you don't date your brother and sisters , you know that concept of family I think that they can put the relation piece off for a while or maybe when they both move out and they move on and they wanna continue to, to, you know, have a relationship that's, that's fun with me. But as long as they're in the house, you know, and then not to mention the parents' concerns. I'm getting calls from the parents, from the other residents because they're going home and telling mom and dad you know Melissa and Trent(ph) are fighting and it's very uncomfortable and when we were having the dinner you know I, I-- they're feeling the tension and it's, it's just not the time and place right now and I want her to see that, that-- you know it's not, I don't want them not have the relationship, it's just not, not here, not now, maybe later. 

01:12:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:12:10
LISA And I don't want - 

01:12:10
JOHN WINSLADE So for you... 

01:12:10
LISA - I don't want Melissa(ph) to be kicked out. Well I don't want Trent(ph) to be kicked out, you know, because there been inappropriate incidents in front of the other residents or thinking that is okay, that they're can joining the other one in the room. There are so many things that could happen, so many negative things that's where my concern comes in. 

01:12:30
JOHN WINSLADE And you spoke before about some other, uhm, incidents like this back in the past - 

01:12:35
LISA Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

01:12:35
Deconstructive inquiry into the back story 

01:12:35
JOHN WINSLADE - and I wonder you know have those incidents affected how you think about this now? 

01:12:40
LISA Definitely, definitely. 

01:12:40
JOHN WINSLADE Could you help me understand or help maybe, help Michelle understand you know how and why that those things affected you? 

01:12:50
LISA Well, the consequences, I mean they were all negative, uhm, and then-- and in the bottom line as they didn't even end up in a relationship. They had to breaking up and going of all the, you know, on their own, but it was, we was getting to problem where we're gonna have to release one of them, ask one of them to leave because it was just-- it was still overwhelming for the rest of the residents. It wasn't fair. 

01:13:10
JOHN WINSLADE So what was overwhelming? What, what exactly was - 

01:13:10
LISA The tension that they would bring in - 

01:13:10
JOHN WINSLADE - the tension? 

01:13:10
LISA - if they were arguing or they were, uhm, being affectionate, you know it just was uncomfortable, but it took that comfort up. We were a family. 

01:13:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:13:20
LISA And then when they started being a couple, it was no longer a family. It was different and it didn't work. 

01:13:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, uhm, I guess I'm interested in what you learned from that experience happened in the past and what conclusions you brought forward into how you work in the home since? 

01:13:45
LISA It is just, uhm, I guess a basic standard, we just don't allow relationship to be developed in the home. Uhm, for many reasons, we, we want them to all be able to work comfortable with each other and not always pick to work with just one person you know there's activities where, you know, maybe just the girls are gonna go and he may not get to go and, you know, in the past it was just always a conflict and if we could do with less conflict then that would be better and, and again keep it comfortable for everybody. 

01:14:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Can I come to you Michelle ? 

01:14:20
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

01:14:20
Michelle's perspective also has a back story 

01:14:20
JOHN WINSLADE So you've had a different view on this and I guess I'm interested in, ah, understanding that view and how you come to that view and, and what's the background that you bring towards, so who would you like to start? 

01:14:30
MICHELLE Well, I didn't know that example about what happened in the past. 

01:14:35
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

01:14:35
MICHELLE But at the same time, for the past 12 years they haven't taught the residents any basic skills as far as integrating to the community, so I wonder if we were to teach them about appropriate relationships and sexual education and we went through all of that then what would be the problem? 

01:14:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so you are seeing this in the context of some different kind of education - 

01:15:00
MICHELLE Yeah. 

01:15:00
JOHN WINSLADE - I mean is that where, where those ideas come from for you? What's the-- have you had background - 

01:15:10
MICHELLE Yeah. 

01:15:10
JOHN WINSLADE - connection with anything like this before or what? 

01:15:10
MICHELLE I think, I mean my training tells me that, if you want to integrate these individuals, you know, they have personalities and they're just like everyone else into the community. 

01:15:20
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

01:15:20
MICHELLE You can't ignore the fact that they are gonna want to have a relationship. 

01:15:25
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

01:15:25
MICHELLE So when they exit our program then we're just expected that they're supposed to know what to do. 

01:15:30
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

01:15:30
MICHELLE And then we teach them how to balance a check book, we should teach them everything that goes along with living. 

01:15:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. You're nodding? 

01:15:40
LISA I agree. I think they should learn, uhm, some skills on how to be in a healthy relationship. I'm not saying that at all. I think that, ah, when they do that sort of program they should have you know an idea of, you know, about safe sex and all those other issues that are gonna be present. But right now, my main concern is no relationships in the house, period. And it is not just for Melissa and Trent(ph), it's for everybody across the board. Always been and will continue that way. 

01:16:10
JOHN WINSLADE So, if I understand you are right, you're not excluding some of Michelle's ideas about the education that might work and might happen. 

01:16:15
LISA Right, right. Let's bring them then, they need to learn the stuff. 

01:16:20
JOHN WINSLADE But you wanting to what to have Michelle on board with the idea of - 

01:16:25
LISA No relationships. 

01:16:25
JOHN WINSLADE - saying no relationships in the house - 

01:16:30
LISA Between the residents. 

01:16:30
JOHN WINSLADE - as a rule. 

01:16:30
LISA Yes. 

01:16:30
Values are understood better when rooted in experience 

01:16:30
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Uhm, Michelle can I just ask you, you said you kinda thought about this for your study and things like that. Have you had any other, I mean is your view on this influenced by any other experience? I mean Lisa talked about the experience that she had with a few years ago, how about for you? 

01:16:50
MICHELLE Well, I guess I don't really have any first hand experience, but I, I just empathized with the residents so much to where I don't want to exclude them and make them so restricted to where they feel like they are not a part of us where - 

01:17:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:17:05
MICHELLE - other people can have relations, but somehow they can or they can't. You know, when we were talking about couple of weeks ago why can't they go to the concert, I feel like this is very similar. 

01:17:15
JOHN WINSLADE So, is it like an, an issue of equality and value and - 

01:17:20
MICHELLE Yeah. 

01:17:20
JOHN WINSLADE - and, and a value and of that that's important to you? 

01:17:20
MICHELLE It's almost like I feel like we're discriminating against them they're somehow not good enough to want the same things. 

01:17:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, okay. So as you look at it from that point of view of not discriminating and, uhm, treating people fairly and equally and treating people with disabilities as just as you would treat anybody else. Then, you know, that-- as look at it from that point of view you would see no objection am I right to Melissa and Trent(ph) - 

01:17:55
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

01:17:55
JOHN WINSLADE - having a relationship and holding hands and being intimate with each other or whatever. 

01:18:00
MICHELLE Exactly. As long as we can educate them, the way you would educate any other teenager. I don't see anything wrong with that. 

01:18:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Do you have any response to that particular perspective education? 

01:18:15
LISA I'm all for the education totally. I think it's, it's, it's valuable, it's beneficial for everybody, but no I will not bend when it comes to allowing the residents to have a relationship that's just standard. No relationships they can you let when I leave that's what I would mean, but while they're living in their home in the Clark(ph) Family Care Home. 

01:18:35
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

01:18:40
LISA No relationships between each other. 

01:18:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So this is quite a difference in view point between you. 

01:18:45
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

01:18:45
Externalizing the differences again 

01:18:45
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. And can I ask, can I go back to asking what this difference is doing? I mean has it taken you back into the place where you were avoiding each other and not talking or not? 

01:19:00
LISA It could. It could because it's another way of her showing no respect to the policy and regulations and the standards that we already have. I, I just wanted to respect that too. She has done a great job of respecting me, just respect the rules and, and see the benefit to it that's all I ask it's, it's only that cause problems. 

01:19:20
MICHELLE Well, like before there, there is nobody in policy on relationships that's just the way it has always been done. But what I'm saying is if it's done differently then maybe the outcome wouldn't be what happened before. You know, because they just ignore the fact that they wanted to have relationship, but if they're treated a little bit differently, maybe they would have a little bit more direction about the fighting and that we could establish rules for the relationships and instead of just saying, okay no relationship. 

01:19:50
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. So when Lisa was talking about the, the experiences of what happened in the past. And, you know, what you make of that and how do you incorporate what she said on to what you would decide? 

01:20:10
MICHELLE It reminds me of more talking about couple weeks ago where everything was special Olympics and special people and only you know being around others with disabilities. I just wonder, if that's the way the relationship problem was handled before, then it was somehow different than maybe of those problems wouldn't have happened. 

01:20:30
JOHN WINSLADE She is shaking her head. 

01:20:30
LISA No, no. Ah, ah, there wasn't a whole many, there was many other factors I mean not to mention the parents calling in I mean you have to see that everybody was uncomfortable, not just Lisa. It wasn't my rule, it's just for everybody's benefit and you know when they're fighting and the other residents are watching if, if they want any relationship, we wouldn't would have that problem. We already have too many problems, we don't need more problems and, and I-- you know, what like you said, integrate them into the community, well, we integrate them and they meet someone out there and they wanna develop relationship with some one out there that's sounding better. But in the house, as a family, it just doesn't work. It's not going to work. It's just gonna be more problems. And, you know, maybe you'll see that. I hope you do because if you continue to work in this field, you are going to see it and, ah, maybe you all understand that. I, I don't know what else to tell, say that, you know, other than past experience and the parents calling in and all the concerns that I'm giving is just a headache. And if, there was just no relationships it would eliminate that problem, period. 

01:21:40
MICHELLE We have fam-- we have rules in the house as far as getting along and what would be the difference if they were in a relationship, I mean the residents have to respect one and other anyway, whether they are a friend or a boyfriend. 

01:21:50
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

01:21:55
MICHELLE So, why wouldn't we just reinforce the same rule that we have. 

01:22:00
JOHN WINSLADE Do you want to answer that? 

01:22:00
LISA I don't see brothers and sisters in a family. 

01:22:00
MICHELLE But they are not brothers and sisters. 

01:22:05
LISA Holding hands, but we want to keep that idea alive. We sit together, we have family together, we, you know, if, if they are all just family members, they're gonna come and sit at the table, maybe there will be issues, but if they're boyfriend or girlfriend they are going to bring different issues to the table that we don't need to have right now, we're, we're focusing on their future, we're trying to get them in the college, we're trying to get them you know may be in music. I don't know, but I don't think relationships is something we need to be dealing with right now. I'm all for educating them and all the things that you wanted to bring, I think that's a wonderful idea, but I want you to understand why no relationships is something we've always done and it works. It works for us, please just, just be open to that. I'm not trying to you know break up Melissa's and Trent's(ph) wonderful relationship are causing them you know problems I'm not, it's just the way, we've always done and it works, it's just how it is. 

01:23:05
JOHN WINSLADE Is there anything in what Lisa saying that you can connect with? 

01:23:10
Two stories are competing for attention 

01:23:10
MICHELLE Uhm, I guess, I'm torn, I mean, I can appreciate the fact that that make relationships have problems and it was just another extra problem - 

01:23:20
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

01:23:20
MICHELLE - but then at the same time, I think, well we ignore this then what's going to happen to that desire that they want to be together anyway. 

01:23:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, you're torn in two ways, okay. One way, you are torn is to understand something of what Lisa is saying about the need for rules for relationships, on the other hand you're concerned about, you know, Melissa and Trent(ph) will just go ahead anyway, right? 

01:23:50
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

01:23:50
LISA And that's what I'm afraid of? 

01:23:50
JOHN WINSLADE That's what you are afraid of? 

01:23:50
LISA Afraid of. If they go behind, you know, what is expected of them, the problem that it's gonna to cause and, uhm, one of them may have to leave. 

01:24:00
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. 

01:24:00
LISA Before they have been ready to graduate and that's my greatest concern and I really want them to understand that. I want them to stay, I wanna help them, I wanna work with them, but they cannot be in a relationship in order for it to be effective or even you know to keep the peace in the house. 

01:24:20
JOHN WINSLADE So, Lisa is asking for you are understanding or something here and I'm wondering, you know, where are you in terms of being able to understand that or offer understanding or? 

01:24:30
MICHELLE I mean I, I do understand that, and I didn't even think that she would be open or willing to them having education about. 

01:24:35
A unique outcome 

01:24:40
JOHN WINSLADE So that makes a difference, which she said that. 

01:24:40
MICHELLE Yeah, that does. 

01:24:40
JOHN WINSLADE Does that or can you help me understand what difference that makes in terms of understanding between you? 

01:24:50
MICHELLE Because when she brought it up after the concert, I was under the impression that she didn't want them to have relationship or education about a relationship or any kind of discussion about relationship. So, now I see, that she is more leaning to not having the relationship but she does-- she is not against giving them the skills, I guess. 

01:25:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. And is that something that's part of what's important to you? 

01:25:10
MICHELLE Yeah. 

01:25:10
JOHN WINSLADE The, the training and the skill - 

01:25:15
MICHELLE Yeah. 

01:25:15
JOHN WINSLADE - development and the life skills work, like that's part of what your passion has taught? 

01:25:15
MICHELLE Yeah. That's what I'm thinking about, yeah. 

01:25:20
The next step in the counter story 

01:25:20
JOHN WINSLADE Right. So, is there anything, you would like her to understand? Any other? 

01:25:25
MICHELLE Uhm, I would like her to understand that they have feelings just like regular people, I mean they are regular people, and not restrict them or somehow try to over protect them, and then when they go out to the community they are just overwhelmed with experiences that they didn't even know existed. 

01:25:50
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-hmm. You are nodding. 

01:25:50
LISA I can, I can understand where she is coming from. I really I can. But honestly, one of them will have to leave, if they want to continue with the relationship, they can't stay and it's just been like that, and I hate to see one of them go. Don't you want to see them graduate? 

01:26:10
MICHELLE No, I do. I want them to be happy and want them to stay. 

01:26:15
LISA Then they can't stay, if they are gonna get new relationship and try to go sleeping in each other's room. What is that gonna say to the other residents. That's okay. 

01:26:20
MICHELLE Oh, and, yeah, I never thought it would be okay, if they were - 

01:26:25
LISA Yeah. 

01:26:25
MICHELLE - in each others bedroom. I figured they would still follow the rules of the house, just as I'm. 

01:26:30
JOHN WINSLADE So, you can see a usefulness for having rules and limits here too, right? 

01:26:35
MICHELLE Right. Uh-hmm. 

01:26:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. And does that make a difference that, that Michelle can see that? 

01:26:40
LISA Yes, yes. I think she'd understand that. 

01:26:45
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

01:26:45
LISA But I'm not picking on Melissa and Trent(ph) I think they're cute together - 

01:26:45
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

01:26:45
LISA - honestly, but right now, we're, we're focusing on different things. You know building a personal relationship with one of the residents, one of your family members. 

01:26:55
Making meaning of the whole conversation 

01:27:00
JOHN WINSLADE So can I ask you how is this conversation going? Is this is like a continuation of what we talked about last time, but it's also kind of getting a little further into some of those issues that we're dividing you. So, how are going right now at, at, uhm, talking about it? 

01:27:15
MICHELLE I feel better knowing that, she is not gonna completely reject the idea of giving them skills for the whole relationship idea. 

01:27:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:27:25
MICHELLE So as long as we can do, do that part... 

01:27:25
JOHN WINSLADE That feels better. 

01:27:25
MICHELLE That feels better. 

01:27:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. How about for you? 

01:27:30
LISA I feel better, just knowing that she has a bit of understanding of where I'm coming from, I'm not just try to be mean. 

01:27:35
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

01:27:35
LISA I think that it works better this way, and, uhm... 

01:27:40
JOHN WINSLADE That feels better for you - 

01:27:40
LISA Yes. 

01:27:40
JOHN WINSLADE - that she, yeah. 

01:27:40
LISA She understands, where I'm coming from. The understanding. 

01:27:45
Focusing on the relationship identity shift 

01:27:45
JOHN WINSLADE So, is it fair to say that you, while you've just been talking about another difference, that has risen or it's a similar one but it's, it's kind of taken all the new dimension since the concert. And you haven't let that destroy your relationship, your working relationship, you've actually been able to talk about a difference here. 

01:28:05
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

01:28:05
LISA Uh-hmm. 

01:28:05
JOHN WINSLADE I mean this is what it looks like to me, am I right or not? 

01:28:05
MICHELLE Yes. 

01:28:05
LISA Yeah definitely. 

01:28:05
MICHELLE A lot, a lot better. I just didn't think that this was something we would be able to overcome. I, I was really pleased with - 

01:28:15
JOHN WINSLADE Your concern. 

01:28:15
MICHELLE - introducing more events and - 

01:28:20
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

01:28:20
MICHELLE - then things like that, but I thought this'd be something that she'd be rigid on. But it's nice to know that there is some room. 

01:28:30
JOHN WINSLADE So, if you go back to your meeting that you agreed to have next each week. You're still planning to do that? 

01:28:30
LISA Oh, yeah. 

01:28:35
MICHELLE Yes. 

01:28:35
LISA It's, it's very helpful when we spoke. 

01:28:35
JOHN WINSLADE What, what do you think might be on the agenda as a result of this conversation for next week? Anything at all? 

01:28:45
MICHELLE I would like to discuss how we're going to teach them this recent relationship skills. 

01:28:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:28:50
LISA That's a good start. 

01:28:55
JOHN WINSLADE So you, you feel that too? 

01:28:55
LISA Uh-hmm. 

01:28:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Is there another question in there about how you'll actually monitor the relationship between a friend and... 

01:29:00
LISA That's where I was going. I'm just hoping that she will and I'm expecting her to monitor the physical contact and to discourage it at all times between any residents, not just Melissa and Trent(ph) because we're, we're going to get new people coming in and people going and when you see it start just put a stop right away. 

01:29:25
JOHN WINSLADE So, that's something that you need to talk through together more about in your meeting. 

01:29:25
LISA Yes, yes, yes. We will definitely. 

01:29:30
JOHN WINSLADE You're willing to do that? 

01:29:30
MICHELLE I'm willing to. 

01:29:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Well that's great. So, I don't know whether I need to come and check back with you in an another little while, but appreciate... 

01:29:40
LISA We're ready in a couple of months. 

01:29:40
JOHN WINSLADE In a couple of months? 

01:29:40
LISA Yeah, you can check on us. 

01:29:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:29:40
LISA That would be nice. 

01:29:45
JOHN WINSLADE Is it sound good to you? 

01:29:45
MICHELLE Yeah, it is. 

01:29:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Well, good luck and I hope this, the meeting next week gives you a chance to talk through this issues. And I appreciate how you've done this today because you've actually dealt with some quiet meaty philosophical issues. 

01:30:00
MICHELLE Uh-hmm. 

01:30:00
JOHN WINSLADE We've had various, but some difference, which you actually come to, you know, respect each other's position on those. 

01:30:05
LISA Uh-hmm. 

01:30:05
A good conversation is a more important goal than reaching agreement 

01:30:05
JOHN WINSLADE And have a-- what sounds to me like a good conversation now I'm hearing you say that it feels like that for you. 

01:30:10
MICHELLE And I'm excited that we can get over these hurdles that I didn't think we could knock down, so... 

01:30:15
JOHN WINSLADE Well, hmm. 

01:30:20
LISA It makes me feel good. 

01:30:20
MICHELLE Yeah. 

01:30:20
JOHN WINSLADE Great. 

01:30:20
LISA Well, thank you, you have been a, a big help. Thank you 

01:30:25
JOHN WINSLADE You're welcome. 

01:30:25
MICHELLE Thanks. 

01:30:25
JOHN WINSLADE All the best. 

01:30:25
MICHELLE Thank you. 

01:30:30
JOHN WINSLADE See you then. Next time.
