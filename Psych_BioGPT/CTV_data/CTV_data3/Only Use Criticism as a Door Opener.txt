ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember, the importance of positive habit to build a foundation to help you in your trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Using criticism only as an opportunity for finding new and better solutions can be a game changer. Looking at something with a critical eye wherever it is, our behavior, someone else's behavior, something in the environment can be the beginning of a new decision and the chance to open doors or it can be an old habit that leaves us in a cycle of blame and complain with no change. When that happens, we feel frozen and unable to renew ourselves through assessment and gruff. Today's practice is, only use criticism as a door opener. Let's practice together. Listen to each of the phrases and repeat them silently or out loud to yourself. One, "I'm ready to be honest with myself about the things I would like to change."

Three, "When I notice myself use criticism, I can use this information to point out a new area where I can grow." Four, "I'm ready to be honest with myself about the things I would like to change."

Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky, from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
