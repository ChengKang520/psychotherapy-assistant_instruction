Living Love Skills for a Loving Relationship 

00:00:10
With Jon Carlson, Psy. D., Ed. D. 

00:00:10
Pat Love, Ed. D. 

00:00:30
JON CARLSON Welcome to Living Love. I'm Jon Carlson. 

00:00:35
PAT LOVE And I'm Pat Love. 

00:00:35
JON CARLSON Today's program is going to be on loving sexuality. 

00:00:40
PAT LOVE Right. 

00:00:45
JON CARLSON And you're gonna be our guest today, Pat. 

00:00:45
PAT LOVE Yes, my pleasure. 

00:00:45
JON CARLSON We're gonna start with a quiz. 

00:00:50
PAT LOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:00:50
JON CARLSON And then we're gonna talk about this topic. What're some of the things that we're gonna cover? 

00:00:50
PAT LOVE We're gonna look at, first of all, consciousness, or just knowing that there's another pers-- person in the relationship besides you, besides me. 

00:01:00
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:01:00
PAT LOVE It's being aware of the other person. Which is, by the way, a key to loving sexuality. 

00:01:05
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:01:05
PAT LOVE The second thing we're gonna talk about is chemistry. Or that energy between you and your partner. 

00:01:10
JON CARLSON Oh, I like that. 

00:01:10
PAT LOVE The sexual energy, the sensual energy between the two of you. The third thing is compatibility. How are you as friends? How are you as partners? Buddies? Two people. Do you treat your partner as kindly as you do treat your friends? Good question. 

00:01:25
JON CARLSON I don't know about that. 

00:01:25
PAT LOVE And the last-- 

00:01:25
JON CARLSON Better than the mailman. 

00:01:25
PAT LOVE Yeah, really. Last one is commitment, and that is how committed are you, number one, to meeting your partner's needs. Secondly, are you just committed to the marriage, or are you just committed to being together? Or are you really committed to making the relationship better? There's a difference. 

00:01:45
JON CARLSON This program is gonna be fun, I can tell already. 

00:01:50
[music] 

00:01:50
Loving Sexuality 

00:01:50
featuring Pat Love, Ed. D. 

00:01:55
PAT LOVE Because sex is considered something that all animals do, so it's not, so we're not talking, you know, it's a, it's a animal instinct. But eros, or loving sexuality, is about knowing the person you're being sexual with. 

00:02:10
JON CARLSON Why don't we begin with a quiz, and just see how our viewers do in this particular area. 

00:02:15
PAT LOVE Okay. 

00:02:15
Loving Sexuality Quiz 1. I am very accepting of the differences between me and my partner. True False 

00:02:20
JON CARLSON The first question. I'm very accepting of the differences between me and my partner. 

00:02:25

PAT LOVE Yeah. 

00:02:40
JON CARLSON Hmmm. 

00:02:45
 You know. 

00:02:45
PAT LOVE Yeah. 

00:02:45
 I m--, I think I do. 

00:02:45
PAT LOVE Yeah. 

00:02:45
 But I'm not sure. 

00:02:45
JON CARLSON That "very" in there is kind of tricky, isn't it. 

00:02:50
PAT LOVE It is tricky. 

00:02:50
Loving Sexuality Quiz 3. When differences arise, I make a point to see my partner's point of view. True False

00:03:00
PAT LOVE Ohhhh. 

00:03:00
Loving Sexuality Quiz 4. My partner would say I am very loving. True False 

00:03:00
PAT LOVE True or false. My partner would say that I am very loving. Hm, my partner would say that I am very loving. 

00:03:10
JON CARLSON My partner would say. 

00:03:10
FRANK My partner better say that I am very loving. 

00:03:10

00:03:30
Loving Sexuality Quiz 7. I am an easy person to live with. True False 

00:03:35
JON CARLSON Number seven. I'm an easy person to live with. I can't even say that with a straight face. 

00:03:40
PAT LOVE Okay. We know your score on that one. 

00:03:45
 I think I am. But answering from her perspective, I know I am not an easy person to live with. 

00:03:50
PAT LOVE Wow. 

00:03:50
Loving Sexuality Quiz 8. I am very committed to my partner and my relationship. True False 

00:03:50
PAT LOVE Number eight. I am very committed to my partner and my relationship. 

00:03:55
HANK I would actually say yes, true. It was the, very committed to my partner and our relationship. I, I felt crystal clear about that one. The others, uh, so. 

00:04:05
Loving Sexuality Quiz 9. I treat my partner with friendliness and kindness. True False 

00:04:10
JON CARLSON Number nine. I treat my partner with friendliness and kindness. 

00:04:15
PAT LOVE Hm. 

00:04:15
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:04:15
Loving Sexuality Quiz 10. I am very romantic. True False 

00:04:15
PAT LOVE And the last one, I am very romantic. 

00:04:20
 But if I get up in the morning, for coffee or something like that, I don't look at coming to breakfast together as being romantic, and I don't try to instill any romance there. All I want to do is have my breakfast and get out of the house so I can go to work, or, or do what I, I wanna do. I look at a lot of things as just a matter of fact. 

00:04:40
JON CARLSON Boy, this is a good quiz. 

00:04:40
PAT LOVE How did you do? 

00:04:40
JON CARLSON Uh, not as good as the quiz is. And that's, uh, not well. 

00:04:45
PAT LOVE I know. I have room for improvement. 

00:04:50
JON CARLSON Mm. Me too. Pat, just what is loving sexuality? What do you mean by that? 

00:04:55
PAT LOVE Sexuality that is loving means that you not only take the sexual energy between the two of you, but you make it loving. And loving is whatever means loving to you as well as your partner. So that's very, very important. I said I was going to look at these four areas. 

00:05:10
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:05:10
PAT LOVE And the first major area is about consciousness. 

00:05:15
JON CARLSON Okay, well what is-- 

00:05:15
PAT LOVE Consciousness. Yeah. 

00:05:15
JON CARLSON Talk about that a little bit. 

00:05:15
PAT LOVE Wh--, what I think is the biggest problem in relationships, is just, for lack of a better term, self-centeredness. And what I mean by self-centeredness is-- 

00:05:25
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:05:25
PAT LOVE --believing there's only one reality, and I have it. 

00:05:30
JON CARLSON Oh. 

00:05:30
PAT LOVE Just thinking that I know best, or if I want a particular way of touching, or if I wanna be sexual, and you don't, and you're my partner, then there's something wrong with you. 

00:05:40
JON CARLSON I see. 

00:05:40
PAT LOVE Or something wrong with me. Or something wrong with us. It's not recognizing that there are two people in this relationship, that there are two sets of needs, two sets of desires, two sets of wants, and if I really wanna be a lover, I've gotta find out what says, "I love you," to you, which is likely very different than what says, "I love you," to me. 

00:06:00
JON CARLSON And I've gotta do the same thing with you. 

00:06:00
PAT LOVE Exactly. So I've gotta be conscious. 

00:06:05
JON CARLSON Okay. All right. 

00:06:05
PAT LOVE So I've gotta think about it. And I have to think, knowing that there are two separate people before, because what we know is that you will be attracted-- here's the way nature is designed. 

00:06:15
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:06:15
PAT LOVE You're gonna be attracted-- your wife, you are attracted to your wife-- 

00:06:20
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:06:20
PAT LOVE --because she's different than you. Nature selects for diversity. The very fact that you're attracted to your partner means that you're genetically, biologically different. Which means you're gonna have different desires and different wants. Nature selects for diversity. 

00:06:35
JON CARLSON Okay, so sometimes when I, I remember when I was dating, I would see somebody that I should like that looked like-- 

00:06:40
PAT LOVE Right. 

00:06:40
JON CARLSON --this is perfect person for me. 

00:06:40
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:06:40
JON CARLSON And there was nothing there. 

00:06:40
(crosstalk) PAT LOVE Yes. Yes, because nature wants you to meet, mate and procreate, and raise healthy offspring. And what nature knows is that if you mate with a partner whose DNA, whose genetic structure is similar to yours, like a close relative-- 

00:06:55
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:06:55
PAT LOVE Your offspring won't be, be as healthy. So nature really has designed-- you actually can tell by pheromones, or a person's aroma, or odor. There was this sweaty t-shirt story. It's actually a research story. 

00:07:10
JON CARLSON A t-shirt story? 

00:07:10
PAT LOVE A sweaty t-shirt study. And they took 100 men, and they had 'em wear the same tee-shirt for, over the weekend. 

00:07:15
JON CARLSON I know some guys who'd probably like to do that. 

00:07:20
PAT LOVE In Texas, honey, this is not a problem. So they had them wear these, these sweaty tee-shirts over the weekend. Seal 'em up every night, don't wear deodorant, don't wear aftershave. And then they had women sniff these t-shirts and rate them in accordance with, I'm very attracted to this aroma, or I'm repelled by this aroma. And what they found was the women were attracted to the t-shirt of the man whose DNA, whose molecular genetic structure-- 

00:07:40
JON CARLSON Wow. 

00:07:40
PAT LOVE --was least like hers. So a big part of attraction is about finding someone who is a good match for you, meaning they're different than you. So just the fact that you're attracted to your partner means you're gonna be different. So that's the consciousness I'm really talking about, is that every now and then, you have to try on your partner's reality. Because what says, "I love you," to me, what is sensual and sexy to me, may not be for my partner. 

00:08:10
JON CARLSON It's probably not gonna be, if, if-- 

00:08:10
PAT LOVE It's probably not going to be. 

00:08:15
JON CARLSON --if this theory is correct. 

00:08:15
PAT LOVE That's not going to be. And that's at the bottom line issue. That's a bottom line issue, at the problem issue of most relationships. Thinking, well, you oughta be like me. 

00:08:25
JON CARLSON And there's nothing wrong with me if I'm not that way, or nothing. 

00:08:25
PAT LOVE Exactly. 

00:08:25
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:08:25
PAT LOVE Exactly. So we know just the fact that you're attracted means that you're different, and so it's accepting difference, trying to see your partner's point of view. Because, so oftentimes, people say, "Dr. Love, you know, in ten seconds, how can I, how can I improve my relationship?" And the answer is, find out what says, "I love you," to your partner, and be willing to do it. 

00:08:45
JON CARLSON Yeah, that's like that old platinum rule. Do unto your partner what your partner wants done unto them. 

00:08:55
PAT LOVE Yeah. Exactly. That's the platinum rule. 

00:08:55
JON CARLSON Yeah, right. Not the gold rule. 

00:08:55
PAT LOVE Yeah, exactly. Because, and, and most people follow the golden rule. 

00:09:00
JON CARLSON Right. 

00:09:00
PAT LOVE They give what they wanna get, but you miss the mark. 

00:09:00
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:09:00
PAT LOVE So consciousness is really trying to understand your partner's point of view. And we're gonna have some techniques that are really gonna help around that. So that's the first one. 

00:09:10
JON CARLSON How bout the second one, this chemistry. 

00:09:15
PAT LOVE Well. 

00:09:15
JON CARLSON Mean IÉ 

00:09:15
PAT LOVE Chemistry. What we know, and we've really found out a lot from re-- research in the past ten years, is that your biology, your hormone structure, actually has more to do with your sex life than probably your relationship. I mean,-- 

00:09:30
JON CARLSON Oh boy. 

00:09:30
PAT LOVE People often blame their relationship for their desire level. 

00:09:35
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:09:35
PAT LOVE And when I'm talking about desire, I'm talking about the, not the, the psychological desire, but the physical urge to engage in sex. The extent to which men and women have testosterone, just simplistically putting it, the extent to which you have testosterone, is the extent to which you will have the walking around, physical urge to engage in sex. Now there are low, moderate and high-T people. There are low-T women, low-T men. Moderate-T women, moderate-T wom--. High-T women, and high-T men. Now granted, there are more high-T men than women, but there are millions of high-T women, and millions of low-T men. And what we know is that in the beginning of a relationship, because remember, nature wants us to meet, mate, procreate, raise healthy kids, okay. 

00:10:25
JON CARLSON Sure. Okay. 

00:10:25
PAT LOVE In the beginning, in that three-to-six month romantic love, euphoric stage where going to Walmart for poultry scissors is an altered state of consciousness and an existential experience, during that romantic love stage, what happens is-- 

00:10:40
JON CARLSON Wow. Been there. 

00:10:40
PAT LOVE --your libido, your sex energy, spikes. 

00:10:45
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:10:45
PAT LOVE So the low-T person looks and sounds and acts like a high-T person. 

00:10:50
JON CARLSON Oh. 

00:10:50
PAT LOVE Course the high-T person thinks I have died and gone to heaven. 

00:10:55
JON CARLSON This is the real deal. 

00:10:55
PAT LOVE This is the real deal. And the low-T person thinks I've finally found someone I'm really "in love" with. Because in this culture, and this, I think is very sad, Jon, in this culture, we equate sexual desire with love. 

00:11:10
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:11:10
PAT LOVE And you know, what's interesting, if you look at the Romans, if you look at, at the Greeks, they never made a temple to sex. They always made it, the temples were to Eros, which was the god or the god, goddess of love. Because sex is considered something that all animals do, so it's not, so we're not talking, you know, it's a, it's an animal instinct. 

00:11:30
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:11:30
PAT LOVE But Eros, or loving sexuality, is about knowing the person you're being sexual with. So what we know is in that romantic love stage, you have a lot of sexual energy. And unfortunately in this culture, we make up sexual attraction equals love. And I'm here to tell you, you can be highly attracted to a jerk, or jerkette. Just because you're attracted to someone chemicallyÉ You know, if you meet enough people, you're gonna find a DNA match, another one. Even if you're happily married, happily committed, you can find another-- if you just interface with enough people, whether it's on the internet, or wherever-- so fidelity is really about your intentions, not you're inclinations. So what we know is in this romantic love period, there's lots of sexual energy. The high-T person's happy, the low-T person thinks, wow. 

00:12:25
JON CARLSON They're surprised. 

00:12:25
PAT LOVE Then-- they're surprised. Really surprised. 

00:12:25
JON CARLSON I've never felt like this before, it's a lot of-- 

00:12:30
PAT LOVE Exactly. 

00:12:30
JON CARLSON --character forming. 

00:12:30
PAT LOVE So that must be in love. 

00:12:30
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:12:30
Hi-T "Desire Discrepancy" Lo-T 

00:12:30
PAT LOVE So then the low-T person goes back to normal. Now here's the operative word. And then you've got-- 

00:12:40
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:12:40
PAT LOVE --this discrepancy between the high-T and the low-T. And this is what's known as, unfortunately, the most common sexual problem. 

00:12:50
JON CARLSON Well, And the, the, the, the high-T person feels that they've been led on. 

00:12:55
PAT LOVE Absolutely. I've been tricked. 

00:12:55
JON CARLSON They've been duped. 

00:12:55
PAT LOVE Betray--, or they feel inadequate, you know. Or you don't love me. Or, you're not interested in me, and this is just the low-T going back to normal, now here's the good news. 

00:13:05
JON CARLSON And that's pretty common. 

00:13:05
PAT LOVE It's, it's normal for over half the population. 

00:13:10
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:13:10
PAT LOVE Over half the female population over 40, don't have enough testosterone to get aroused just, just spontaneously. So we know, thank goodness, there are two pathways to arousal. One is the autogenic, which means your physical urge, walking around, hormone level. 

00:13:25
JON CARLSON All right. 

00:13:25
PAT LOVE And the second is the psychogenic. That's why we say all you need is the desire to desire. All you need. Once I got that, because I'm a low-T female. I have been all my life. Once I got it, okay, I can make a decision. I can make a decision about what kind of lover I wanna be. I can make a decision how I want to please my partner. And we'll talk a lot more about that chemistry component, because that's a big part of loving sexuality. Knowing, you say, okay if you just take out those magical moments, those falling in love, those infatuation spikes, take those out, look at your libido throughout your life, you, you probably know if you're low, moderate, or high-T. And it just so happens, remember, nature selects for diversity. 

00:14:15
JON CARLSON Sure. 

00:14:15
PAT LOVE High-T, guess what they pick? 

00:14:20
JON CARLSON Oh boy. 

00:14:20
PAT LOVE Low-T. 

00:14:20
JON CARLSON It's like, it's like, I heard Dr. Ruth once say there's two kinds of people in the world. The ones who always want it, and the ones who don't what it. Why do they always marry one another? 

00:14:30
PAT LOVE Why do they always get together. 

00:14:30
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:14:30
PAT LOVE And that's normal. So we wanna normalize that. We're gonna talk about chemistry in that way. So that I can come to my partner and say, "Okay, here's the hand I've been dealt." How I'm going to play it, really, that's what determines that I don't have to blame my partner, myself, my relationship, for what is biologically predetermined. 

00:14:45
JON CARLSON As a, as a high-T person, my whole life, I would think we could just put testosterone in people's toothpaste, or something, and wouldn't that work? 

00:15:00
PAT LOVE Yeah. Be careful what you ask for. Because what comes with testosterone sometimes is a lot of energy, a lot of aggression, a lot of irritability, power and control, so be careful what you ask for. There was an article written by a woman who actually took testosterone and I did too, and we'll talk about that later, because it does have side-effects, and I'm certainly not advocating this, I'm just saying that it has side-effects and for those of us who are there, you know. 

00:15:30
JON CARLSON Well, tell us about that third part. 

00:15:30
PAT LOVE The compatibility. 

00:15:30
JON CARLSON The compatibility part. 

00:15:30
PAT LOVE Yes, yes. And in fact, this is probably, if not one of the more, uh, important elements, because just about every research study talks about what gets couples through the rough spots is their friendship. So, we're gonna talk about how are you as playmates, best friends, confidants, financial partners, social partners. Do you treat yourself and your partner kindly. Are you easy to live with? That one that you couldn't get out on the quiz, you know. Am I easy to live with? Can I, can I get along? You know, some people have a, a public persona, and a private persona. And, and, I ask this question. At your worst, what is one word that would describe living with you? At your worst? What would, what's one word describe living with you? 

00:16:15
JON CARLSON Uhhhh. Distant. Gone. 

00:16:20
PAT LOVE Yeah, lonely is the word I think of. 

00:16:20
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. Yeah 

00:16:20
PAT LOVE Yeah. 

00:16:20
JON CARLSON That's one that would, would come up right away. 

00:16:25
PAT LOVE Yeah. And you think about it, do, do I treat my partner as well as I treat my best friend. Do I speak with respect, do I speak kindly, am I thoughtful? Um, so that's that compatibility piece because it really does take you through the rough spots. And that's a way that people bond with each other. And that, over the long-haul, that's, that's the part of eros that isn't in sex. 

00:16:50
JON CARLSON Especially in today's marriages, that we have these marriages that are companionate marriages. A traditional marriage is where somebody strong might marry somebody who was weak, or somebody who was smart might marry somebody who wasn't. 

00:17:05
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:17:05
JON CARLSON And vice-versa, so you could make it in today's world. 

00:17:05
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:17:05
JON CARLSON But now it's, relationship of companions, isn't it. 

00:17:10
PAT LOVE Right. And there's so much stress in today's world, we're so busy. We have so many, uh, expectations of ourselves from outside, from in the home, and so it takes two people cooperative, cooperating to make it all work. So how are you when it comes-- do you know your partner and treat him or her, do you share yourself? See, what we know is that passion is a composite of two sexual beings joined by intimacy. The only way I can make love is to, if I say to my partner, "I want to make love to you." But I haven't taken time to know him, or to know who he is, or to listen to him, I'm really just wanting to have sex. That's very different. You see. And there's a time and place for that. But to say, "I want to make love to you," to my partner, I have to know who he is. And he has to know who I am. So for half the population, this friendship is not just a, it's a precondition for being sexual. See, what, what high-T people often don't understand about low-T people is the low-t person has to work so hard to get aroused. You have to focus. You have to concentrate. You have to really be very, don't, don't talk-- 

00:18:25
JON CARLSON Maybe kinda like running a marathon, or something? 

00:18:25
PAT LOVE It, it is. It's very, very intense, and it's v--, you have, it's work. So, if you've been, if my partner's been rude to me or unkind to me or haven't, hasn't been intimate with me, then, at the end of the day, and he's asking me to work for another 30 minutes? I don't think so. 

00:18:45
JON CARLSON That's not foreplay. 

00:18:45
PAT LOVE You see what I'm-- so, so what the high-T person doesn't understand about the low-T person is that it really is 24 hours a day. Because you being loving to me, you're giving me something to work with. You're giving me-- it's easy to be sense-- sexual and sensual with my partner because he's so intimate with me. He's a friend, he's a buddy, he's, he helps me. He helps me around the house. I mean-- 

00:19:05
JON CARLSON So, so this loving foreplay is very different than what publicized in romantic relationships. 

00:19:10
PAT LOVE Absolutely. If you wanna make love to me, you know, run the vacuum, you know. That, that's a, that's foreplay for me. 

00:19:20
JON CARLSON Oh my. 

00:19:20
JON CARLSON Because that is a partnership. Gimme something to work with, you know. You're really giving me a reason to be-- because for the low-T person, a lot of the sexuality needs to be altruistic. You know, I've got to reach down and I've got to really work on myself, you see what I'm saying? And for the low, person, that's not, not a natural intimate, not a natural in-path for, for me, let's say if, if talking about myself doesn't come easily, then I've gotta meet, meet your needs. 

00:19:50
JON CARLSON Sure. 

00:19:50
PAT LOVE So that you're saying, you know what. Because gifting, truly giving a gift, is the natural response to feeling full. And so if you have two partners, and let's say if you and I are partners, and I'm meeting your needs, and I'm watching you and I'm d--, I'm, I'm seeing what you like and, and what your desires are, and I'm willing to step up, even though that isn't my desire, and meet your need, the natural response to that, and this is not quid pro quo, by the way, just the natural response is altruism. Where you wanna give back. So we're gonna talk about friendship. 

00:20:20
JON CARLSON That's kinda hard to do, I mean, cuz you're suggesting that people really have to then start to do something new. 

00:20:30
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:20:30
JON CARLSON That's a hard thing to do. 

00:20:30
PAT LOVE It is, it is, it is really hard. That's where commitment comes in. Because-- 

00:20:35
JON CARLSON And that's our final point. The commitment. 

00:20:35
PAT LOVE Right. This is our final point, the commitment. And that is that I, I can, let's say if we're partners, I can be committed to you. But there's a difference in being, I say, unfaithful, unloyal, I show up here every night, I bring home my paycheck, you know. I cook three of the four -- seven meals every, you know, I, I'm faithful. 

00:20:55
JON CARLSON Sure. 

00:20:55
PAT LOVE I'm loyal. But am I also committed to the relationship. you know, I don't know, the thing that has stood out to me, Jon, about this Living Love series, is that you have to be asking, what's good for the relationship. 

00:21:05
JON CARLSON What's good for us, not just me, and for you. 

00:21:10
PAT LOVE Yes, yes. Not just me, not just you, but what's good for our relationship. Now that's a high form of commitment. Am I committed not only to you, my partner, but to our relationship, and making it better. Making it better. 

00:21:20
JON CARLSON Uh, what can one can expect though? I mean, I mean expectation must have a lot to do with it. 

00:21:25
PAT LOVE It's big. I think happiness is the ratio between what you expect and what you get. And that's why commitment is so important. Cuz I think commitment means that if I'm committed to you, that you have the right to expect me to meet at least some of your needs some of the time. That's what it means. Doesn't mean I have to meet all your needs all the time. That's unrealistic. But, in fact that's why I think people avoid commitment a lot of the times, they don't wanna give the right to expect something of him or her. 

00:21:55
JON CARLSON Sure. 

00:22:00
PAT LOVE So, I think that, and wh--, another thing we're gonna do is we're gonna really get clear about what do you have the right to expect? What can you ask of me, as your partner, that you don't have to fear rejection. You know, what am I, what am I committing to. 

00:22:10
JON CARLSON And, I'm gonna have an expectancy, one thing, about your chemistry, for example. 

00:22:15
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:22:15
JON CARLSON And we really need to understand where people are on that high-T, low-T continuum? 

00:22:20
PAT LOVE Yes. Yes. Yes, and it does change over time, and many things can change it, but I've gotta be realistic. You're a lot more likely to be happy and satisfied if you get your expectations in line with reality. 

00:22:35
JON CARLSON And then in terms of compatibility, like I have expectations and I need to get those in line. 

00:22:40
PAT LOVE Yes. A friendship. I need to get those in line with reality. See, I, I, I might say, you know, getting married just means I show up here every night. But your expectation might be we have an intimate conversation at least once a week, around compatibility. So we've got to get those in line with reality. We've gotta be willing to negotiate and collaborate and cooperate with one another. 

00:23:00
JON CARLSON Gonna have to do that with commitment too. 

00:23:00
PAT LOVE Absolutely. 

00:23:00
 I have a comment. I, I go back to one of our previous meetings about Hank and the shoes by the back door, which is also one of my pet peeves. And, when Pat says you have to balance expectations with reality, uh, Hank's and my expectations for the shoes to be away from the door, stacked up real neat, in my case, there's six children. And those shoes will never be stacked up that neat. And, so, I have to add that to the rest of my life too, uh, to get the things more in line. 

00:23:35
PAT LOVE Yeah. Well, and I think it's, it's, um, it's the, what does history, history's the best predictor of the future. However, I remember when my children were young, and they would leave things lying around and I'm sort of a neatnik, and so I just got a big box to put 'em in. At least it, at least it got 'em out of the way with a lid on it. And I remember too, another expert talking about what would you give up, what goes with that particular characteristic in other words, my, my husband like a neat house, however, and, and no matter how many boxes I get him, he'll have all the stuff lying around the neat little ornate boxes that I get him, you know, cause I like everything in a box, with a lid down, sort of like it came out of a magazine, you know, that's my issue. And so he just has his stuff, but then I realize what goes with that is his relaxed attitude, his patience, he's not compulsive. And so I have to see, well if I asked him to give that up, what would go with it. What would, what would go out with the baby in the wastewater. So, I have to balance. And also, some things are worth arguing about and some aren't. But, I don't know about you, I tripped over a dog the other day, coming out, if you're gonna trip over those shoes, you know, that may, you know if it's dangerous or if you're teaching a good habit, so you do have to weigh it, and look at the other person's point of view. I loved what you said, they got six kids. That's a reality. And so I'm thinking, you know, maybe better by the back porch than all over the kitchen and the dining room and the living room and they can't find their shoes, so, so you're right. How much of this, it what's worth arguing about, how do you spend your airtime. You know. 

00:25:10
JON CARLSON That's that rule, the ten-minute rule, or ten-second rule. If it takes ten seconds or less to do it, just, pick up the shoes and put 'em aside. And, I think that was a real gem that someone taught me. 

00:25:25
PAT LOVE Oh, ten-second rule, I like that. 

00:25:25
JON CARLSON Yeah. Other comments. Reactions. 

00:25:30
HANK Well, one of the things I'm aware of is my expectations. I've been working on this, this is kinda giving me more momentum. But, uh, a lot of times when my expectations aren't met, I make that a condition of my love, uh, for instance, I'll withdraw if I don't feel the expectations being met then I, I use that as a reason in my heart to maybe withdraw support, not be cooperative either, uh, it creates a chain reaction, and um, that's something I'm becoming more aware of now. Uh, that if my expectations aren't met, I have a reaction to that, and it's a condition. Unmet, now I do this in response. 

00:26:10
PAT LOVE And, I know if I get anxious enough, I'd rather pick a fight than have him withdrawn. I, I just have to tell you, I might as well get it over with. 

00:26:15
CONNIE Yes, and I have. 

00:26:20
PAT LOVE And I will pick a fight. Why, because, the withdrawing, my anxiety just goes higher and higher and higher until I just -- I'd rather be like lightning. I'm just gonna strike, honey, no matter what you say. Cause I've got five subjects you can't ignore, and I will throw one of 'em out, and, and you know, cuz I'd rather do that than live with the withdraw. 

00:26:40
CONNIE I'd rather bring it to a head. 

00:26:40
PAT LOVE You got it. 

00:26:40
CONNIE Let's just get it to a head, and let's get it over with. 

00:26:40
PAT LOVE And then I say things I regret later. 

00:26:45
CONNIE Oh, well, so. 

00:26:45
PAT LOVE So, okay. So now we know we're all-- 

00:26:45
CONNIE That's his territory. 

00:26:50
PAT LOVE We've described one scenario. Someone else, I saw another. Yes. 

00:26:50
 Yeah, um, at the beginning of your discussion you were talking about phys-- physical attraction-- 

00:26:55
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:26:55
 --starts the relationship. Yet, Lisa and I, met in the 90s version, we actually met through a dateline. 

00:27:05
PAT LOVE Uh-huh 

00:27:05
 Never saw each other for a month apart in conversation. 

00:27:05
PAT LOVE Yes. Yes. 

00:27:05
 Yet, before I ever met her face-to-faceÉ 

00:27:10
PAT LOVE Yeah. 

00:27:10
 I felt she was somebody I really wanted to meet-- 

00:27:10
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:27:10
 --and really wanted to be with. Now is this just a lucky crapshoot, or can you actually get something. 

00:27:15
PAT LOVE No, absolutely. Many people meet each other online, and do live happily every after. It happens all the time now. And you can tell a lot about someone in what they write. You can tell in the way they language. You can tell, and by the way after you have a few exchanges, what's the first thing you ask for online? Once you've had a few good emails that go back and forth, what do you want? 

00:27:40
 A picture. 

00:27:40
PAT LOVE A picture. You wanna know next. In fact there was a study where they took, again, 100 pictures, lined people up and they rated them in accordance with attractiveness, and from a picture, it correlated with DNA. That you can actually pick a DNA match from a picture. And also in the exchange you get a feel for someone how much psychological attraction there is just from the way she wrote, the way she languaged, the way he, she expressed herself, the way she describedÉ or, even formed a sentence. It starts to tell something about you. Good thing we have spellcheck, otherwise I would be in big trouble, in my email. But you're right, you can still tell a lot and, um, even over the phone. There are people that fall in love, you know, just talking on a phone. A telephone conversation. You can tell a lot by someone's voice. So again, and there also there's such a thing as a psychological attraction. It's not just physical. And it's not always just the first attraction, but usually it's what we see first that-- because as soon as you start to email, you want to know, well what is this person look like. And you get a picture. And you tell a lot from a picture. 

00:28:50
JON CARLSON How long did it take for pictures to-- 

00:28:50
 Um, like I said, we talked five times, I think on the phone over a month period. Plus, during that time, I went on a week's vacation and couldn't wait to get back from Florida to finally meet her. 

00:29:00
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:29:00
 Uh, and then finally, when we met face-to-face was the first time we ever got to see what each other looked like, physically. 

00:29:05
PAT LOVE Wow. 

00:29:05
JON CARLSON Are you gonna give us some desire education or something like that later? 

00:29:10
PAT LOVE I'm gonna give you, I will give you desire education. We're gonna talk exactly about this specific issue. And the first step to this, of course, is consciousness. It is to how to step into the other person's point-of-view. Especially when you get in that gridlock. Is there anyone here who hasn't been in gridlock? Anyone even listening to this video, watching this video, who hasn't been in a gridlock? Saying, well I will, you know when you give me what I want, then. Or saying, well, I gave last time. I'm always giving. Then you step back, and you say, "What is best for the relationship?" 

00:29:45
JON CARLSON Why don't we just into this first activity then on consciousness. 

00:29:45
PAT LOVE Okay. Okay. Okay. 

00:29:50
JON CARLSON Can, can you-- 

00:29:50
PAT LOVE Yeah, uh. 

00:29:50
JON CARLSON --help us? 

00:29:50
Loving Sexuality Exercise 1 Consciousness 

00:29:50
PAT LOVE And, and what I said earlier was that consciousness is really getting into the world of the other person. Realizing that there's another person in this with me. And maybe getting a vision of what it's like living with me. And so, um, I, I tell this story that, um, one time when I was interviewing for a job, I was at, at American Counseling Association. It was when I was finishing my doctorate, and I was going for a job interview, and we had these, you'd sign up and then you'd show up, and they would give you an interview, and then you'd find out of you got, you know, to the next round and so forth. It was very, very stressful. And this was in, in 1980, and so I was, it was one of those times when I had heard about stress interviews, where they'd have a whole bunch of candidates in a room, and they would do these odd exercises and see how you acted under stress and that would be part of the interview, and I was just, you know, a real nervous candidate. And then I went, so I went for this interview, and I showed up, and I had on my best interview outfit, and my best, you, interview manners, and, and the guy was sitting there, and he was already sitting there like this, you know, with his arms folded. And so I sat down. He was just like this, and he was to--, and so I sat down you know, I introduced myself. He never said a word, he just sat there, like this and I thought, "Oh my gosh, a stress interview." I thought, you know, "Finally, I got stress interview." And then, and then it was just this big silence. Finally, he said, "Well, I expected you at three o'clock." And I said, "I'm so sorry, I thought it was three-thirty." I said, "I'm--" you know, I thought, here I have already blown it, I'm 30 minutes late for the interview, you know, I have blown this job, I'm not gonna get the job. And then he just sat there. and he didn't say anything. And like, you know, he already said he expected me 30 minutes earlier, and then he just went silent on me, and I sat there, and he sat there. Come to find out he thought I was interviewing him, I thought he was interviewing me, the interviewer never showed up. We were on, we were on, we were both interviewees, and the interviewer never showed up. And he thought I was interviewing him, I thought he was interviewing me, and we went on like this for like ten minutes on a totally different agenda. And in many ways, that's what it's like with you and your partner. 

00:32:05
JON CARLSON Marriage is just like that. 

00:32:05
Loving Sexuality Activity Do you meanÉ? 

00:32:05
"Do You Mean" exercise Sender States a short paragraph beginning with the line: "One of the things I'd like you to understand better about me isÉ" 

00:32:05
"Do You Mean" exercise Sender can only answer "Yes" or "No," but will have a chance to give more information at the end of the exercise. 

00:32:05
PAT LOVE Just like that. That I've got in my head that, um, one day, this was s-- s-- several years back, I was walking through the living room, and I said, as I said earlier, you know, I'm sort of a person who needs space, and distance and quiet time, and private time. And, and I was walking through the living room, and, uh, and I found my husband just like watching me, and I, I felt like he was sort of like watching me all day or something. And I, and I said to him, I said, "You know, I feel like you're watching me." And, and, you know, it was just like sort of making my, making me uneasy. And he looked at me and he said, "I am watching you." And he said, "Cuz I know, you're gonna set that cup down somewhere and five minutes later you're not gonna know where it is and you're gonna expect me to know where it is." And he was right. He was like, totally right. Cuz I'd be saying, "Honey, do you know where I put my coffee cup?" I'd be asking him. He was so right, and so that's what I'm taking about about being conscious. Realizing there's another point-of-view. That when I get in that stuck place, when I get in that conflict, I often think I have the only reality. And I was getting irritated that he was watching me, never thinking that there was a good reason for why he was watching me. So, there's an exercise that's just called, "Do you meanÉ" and it's just a real simple exercise. And I just wanna explain it, and then I wanna demonstrate it, so everyone can get a feeling for what it's like. And it's real simple. One person is the sender, one person is the receiver. And I want you to think about something that you'd really like your partner to understand. Something that you feel like maybe your partner doesn't really get about you, or something that's, you hold a different opinion about than your partner. Or you have a different point of view, or a different desire. So the sender then is just gonna give a paragraph. Here's what, honey, here's what I'd like you to understand. And you just give a long description of what it is you'd like your partner to understand. And then the receiver is just going to ask questions, only beginning with the words, "Do you mean." And as the receiver, I'm going to tru-- truly try to understand what it is that you mean. And all you can say, as the sender, is "yes" or "no." Now if it's one of these, you have to say "yes" or "no," and you can explain later. But all you can say is "yes" or "no," and you can't go, "Hmmmm, yea--." You just have to say "yes" or "no." Because what I'm, what it's doing, is trying to get me to really understand. And I'm gonna try to get three yeses, and three nos. And it's simply a little exercise called, "Do you meanÉ" Do I expect you to talk like this all the time? Of course not. What I'm suggesting is, though, that you just check it out. It'll help you see if you really understand your partner, or if you just assume a lot. Do you really get what your partner means? Or you're, are you making it up? Are you projecting your own reality onto your partner? So the exercise is called "Do you meanÉ" and we're gonna try it now. 

00:35:10
JON CARLSON Can we do it with a, with another one of our couples here, so our viewers can really figure out how to do it? 

00:35:15
Loving Sexuality Demonstration 

00:35:15
PAT LOVE Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes, we'll demo it, and then we'll practice it. 

00:35:20
JON CARLSON Great. 

00:35:25
[music] 

00:35:25
PAT LOVE Hank and Connie have volunteered to come up and show us how this works. And Hank, you're going to be the sender. So if you'd start with your send. 

00:35:35
HANK Sure. 

00:35:35
PAT LOVE Your statement you'd like Connie to understand. 

00:35:40
HANK Connie, one of the things I'd like you to understand about, uh, me is how important it is, uh, that we work together on improving the function of our home. I feel strongly about that, it's important to me that, uh, we be able to work together on improving the function of our home. 

00:35:55
PAT LOVE Okay. So, "Do you meanÉ"s, Connie. 

00:36:00
CONNIE Uh, so, do you mean that you want me to take a stronger stand in organizing the house? 

00:36:10
HANK Yes. 

00:36:15
CONNIE And do you mean that you want to work with me in doing this? 

00:36:20
HANK Yes. 

00:36:20
CONNIE And do you mean you want me to get rid of some of my other activities that might keep me from doing this? 

00:36:30
HANK No. 

00:36:30
CONNIE Um, do you mean that, um, that you don't think it's priority of mine to do this? 

00:36:40
HANK Yes. 

00:36:40
PAT LOVE Those were the yeses, aren't they? Three yeses. 

00:36:45
JON CARLSON Three yeses. 

00:36:45
PAT LOVE Okay. See if you can get a couple more nos. 

00:36:50
CONNIE Um, do you mean that you don't like the way I'm doing things now? Ah, that's another yes. 

00:37:00
JON CARLSON He's thinking. He's thinking. 

00:37:00
PAT LOVE She answered for you. This may be a place you ask your worst fear, by the way. 

00:37:05
CONNIE Okay. That was my worst fear. 

00:37:10
PAT LOVE That was your worst fear! You got a yes! Okay, what's your next worst fear? 

00:37:15
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:37:15
CONNIE Okay. Um, do you mean that I really have to put my volunteer stuff on hold? 

00:37:30
HANK No. 

00:37:35
CONNIE Good. Do you mean, um, that I have to spend a lot of my hours of my day in this? 

00:37:45
HANK No. 

00:37:45
PAT LOVE Okay. So that's three yeses and three nos. Anything you'd like to add to that, Hank. 

00:37:50
HANK Just, uh, I feel strongly about making progress. 

00:37:50
PAT LOVE Okay. 

00:37:50
HANK Um, that is really a strong, uh. If I sense we're either de-- in decline, or, uh, uh, things are, are getting worse in some way, it has an effect on me. And, uh, I, I struggle, then. Uh, I have a hard time keeping my equilibrium to be, uh, positive, and, uh, I slide into some habits that aren't so good for Connie or our kids. 

00:38:25
PAT LOVE Okay. 

00:38:25
HANK So it has an effect on me, uh, and I like some help on moving in the other direction. 

00:38:30
PAT LOVE Okay. So. And then if you had set aside this time for you all to spend more time, you could even go into more detail. You could do a "Do you meanÉ" around that piece. And then you would switch roles. And you could talk about this subject or another subject. It's just you understanding Hank's point-of-view. It's just you getting what it's like, and you might just then start to say, tell what it's like, and what this means to you, to have this problem, for us to work together on this. That's all it is, it's just you getting it. And that's a very good example. You get three yeses, three noose, it just stops you and helps you to understand his point-of-view. It's not that he wants you to give up your own work, it's not that he wants you to spend a lot of hours, it's that he wants you to work with him on this. Does that make sense? 

00:39:15
CONNIE That makes sense. 

00:39:20
PAT LOVE Great example. Any questions about how to do this exercise? That's all you have to do is get your three yeses and three nos. Any questions? Uh-huh? 

00:39:30
 What if, uh, communication isn't real good and you start to get frustrated about this? 

00:39:35
"Do You Mean" exercise Sender States a short paragraph beginning with the line: "One of the things I'd like you to understand better about me isÉ" 

00:39:35
"Do You Mean" exercise Sender can only answer "Yes" or "No," but will have a chance to give more information at the end of the exercise. 

00:39:35
Loving Sexuality Please pause your VCR & try this yourselves. 

00:39:35
PAT LOVE Then what you could do is you could sharpen your send. We would go back and have Hank give her a little more information. If it starts to bog down, you just call time and say, "Let's start over again, could you give me a little more information?" And take it from the top and go through three yeses, three nos. And all you're doing is trying to understand your partner's point-of-view. You're not trying to solve it right now. The goal is not to solve it, it's to understand your partner's point-of-view. Once you understand, you'll be able to solve it. So what, what I'd like you to do now. What I'd like you to do is to try this at home. Just one of you be the sender. One of you be the receiver. And we're simply going to have the sender give a short two or three sentence paragraph, something you'd like your partner to understand, and the receiver is just going to ask, "Do you meanÉ" questions until you get three yeses, three nos. Again, if it bogs down take it from the top. You're trying to understand your partner's point-of-view which will raise your consciousness. 

00:40:40
JON CARLSON How did this activity go for you? Did it improve your levels of consciousness? 

00:40:45
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:40:45
BEV I was just thinking. I, I have a problem with vagueness anyway, and he's always telling me that he never can understand me. So, maybe this would be good for me to sharpen-- 

00:40:55
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:40:55
BEV --that a little, and make me more aware of it. 

00:40:55
PAT LOVE If you find your partner with, just coming up clueless. Thank you, thank you, Bev. It's like, then I need to sharpen my send. 

00:41:05
BEV Yeah. 

00:41:05
PAT LOVE And it's good feedback. I know what I mean, and this is exactly the problem. It's like, I, I'm clear to me, what's wrong with your hearing? 

00:41:15
BEV In fact, I was even gonna say that that was one of the things I'd like you to understand, better about me, was, you know, to, uh. Cuz I, I just really struggle with that because I know what I'm saying, and he never does, you know. And, and the more he tries to understand what I'm saying, the more he doesn't understand. 

00:41:30
PAT LOVE Yes. Yes. Now let me ask you. 

00:41:35
BEV It gets frustrating for me. 

00:41:35
PAT LOVE Because, see if I'm relating, because sometime I am making up my mind as I talk out loud. I don't, my husband on the other hand really thinks internally. When it comes out his mouth, it's very clean, it's very precise. It's cut and dried. But I think, it's almost like I'm making up my mind. I don't know if that's -- it's almost like I've got to hear myself talk. 

00:41:55
BEV But, the problem is, I, I understand what I'm saying. And the more he asks me, to, to clarify it, the more frustrated I get, because I know -- I don't know how to change it, you know, to clarify it. 

00:42:10
JON CARLSON Then he's really not jerking you around, it's that he's really clueless. He's trying very, very hard? 

00:42:15
BEV He really is.Probably, but sometimes I'm just frustrated because of that, because I feel like-- 

00:42:20
JON CARLSON So then you both get frustrated. 

00:42:20
BEV He's kinda mocking me a little bit, or something, you know. 

00:42:20
FRANK Well, I always say use less pronouns, use more nouns. Cuz she'll say, "She said," and then, "He did that." And I'm like, "Who?" 

00:42:30
BEV And it happens all the time. 

00:42:35
PAT LOVE So maybe this would be good, just to get more specific. 

00:42:35
BEV Yeah, I was just thinking, might be a good exercise. 

00:42:35
PAT LOVE Thank you. 

00:42:35
JON CARLSON Who else? 

00:42:40
DELLA What I like about this is that you're not, you're not repeating what the person is actually saying, like in a mirror exercise would be. You, pers-- the person says something to you, and then you say it exactly the same way back. You're actually taking what they said and interpreting it to, to what experience would come out of it. 

00:43:00
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:43:00
DELLA And that's what I like about it, is you do some translating in process, and that just-- 

00:43:05
PAT LOVE And isn't this what we do. 

00:43:05
JON CARLSON And we need to keep in mind that the purpose of this is to become aware, or conscious, of the other person's world. About how they see it, and that's the main purpose. 

00:43:15
PAT LOVE Right. Right, and you don't even have to agree with it, you just have to understand, there's another person 

00:43:20
JON CARLSON Understand. Also, if I understand it, that doesn't mean I agree, okay. 

00:43:20
PAT LOVE Doesn't mean you agree. I'm just trying to understand. 

00:43:25
JON CARLSON To understand. 

00:43:25
PAT LOVE So that I get it, there's another person in this relationship. 

00:43:30
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:43:30
CONNIE I was just gonna say that it does help minimize assumptions. Because we're trying to clarify, um, truly what the person is feeling. 

00:43:40
PAT LOVE Exactly. 

00:43:40
CONNIE And meaning. 

00:43:40
PAT LOVE And that's the, that's the goal, that I don't assume, I really try to clarify what's in your mind, and not what's in my mind that I just lay on you. 

00:43:50
HANK And I was gonna say that to reduce defensiveness if, for instance, in that exercise, you know, does that mean I have to give this up, or do, does that mean I have to quit all this activity, say no. Phew, you know, you can kinda say, wow, that's good news. And then you, you got ears again to listen and try and, uh, grasp what the other person's saying. 

00:44:10
JON CARLSON I think we got this awareness thing down pretty well with this group. Let's get onto the chemistry part. 

00:44:15
PAT LOVE All right. 

00:44:15
Loving Sexuality Exercise 2 Chemistry 

00:44:15
JON CARLSON That's the part that I, I'm really interested in. 

00:44:15
PAT LOVE Looking forward to this. Okay. Chemistry is really the sexual energy between you, the playful energy between you, the sensual energy between you, the romantic energy between you. Chemistry is what separates a couple from a friendship. Because if you're just friends, you can actually slide into a brother sister relationship, and for, for some people, they might say, well, that's fine, but most couples want chemistry in addition to a friend. Like, you and I are friends, we're not couples. You have a wife, I have a husband. You're com-- you, you have chemistry with your wife, I have chemistry with my husband. So we're gonna look at this whole idea of chemistry because what people wanna know is how do you keep that alive? How do you keep it alive after you've been looking at the same face every morning for several months, years, decades? And also, how do you initiate something new? Because this is really one of the hurdles that couples need to get over, is okay, we've been doing it the same way, but how do we initiate, how do we start something new? Because there's an awkwardness to that and there's a fear of rejection. So let's look first at sensuality. 

00:45:30
JON CARLSON Yeah, let's look at the four parts. 

00:45:30
PAT LOVE Okay, sensuality is the first one. And what I'm talking about is using all your senses in, in making your, your love life energetic, making it pleasant, making it romantic, making it--. But using touch, using smell, uh, physical affection is a very big part of sensuality. We know, for example, that the touch of another human being, especially your partner, can lower your heart rate. Now, we're talking about non-sexual touching by the way. But just a, a loving caress, or holding hands, or, uh, touching your partner's face, can actually lower your heart rate. It's good for you. This is why, literally, committed couples are healthier and live longer, because it's, it's a stress reliever. So, sensuality is using all of your sense. 

00:46:20
JON CARLSON We could do this in place of aerobic exercise. To reduce our-- 

00:46:20
PAT LOVE Absolutely. Act-- actually, yes, yes, uh, it's, it's very health, healthy for us. In fact, just think about the place where you make love. Is it sensual, is it conducive to love making, or is it piled up with magazines, and it, you know, or laundry, or? Think about it, is it sensual, is it pleasant? Do you use the sense of smell, do you use candles, or aromas, or bubble bath or whatever it is that pleases you? Or the sheets that you sleep on, or, or the clothes that you wear. So, again it's using all of your sense in lovemaking. And again, as I was saying earlier, physical affection is very, very important. Now, it's very, it's very, uh, specific to the individual. Some people like physical affect, affection in public, some people don't. Some people like to hold hands in public, some people don't. Others feel like it's very private. Um, one of the issues I hear with couples a lot is, "You only touch me when you want sex." And so it's usually important to negotiate that with your partner, to know that I want you to touch me affectionally, not just sexually. Because for some us, it's too much of a shift. For example, if I'm washing dishes and you come up and touch me sexually. It's often, it shifts me into another mode. Others say, "Honey, you can touch me sexually any time, anywhere." So it's good to know and be able to communicate this with your partner, so that's sensuality. 

00:47:50
JON CARLSON What about sexuality? 

00:47:55
PAT LOVE Sexuality is, is, are the techniques you use to arouse yourself and your partner. You need to know about your body. You need to know about your partner's body. You need to somehow be able to express that to your partner. And also to know your needs. They say that sex, by the way, is only 10% of any relationship, but it's often the first 10%. You don't have to be sexual in your relationship, especially if your partner doesn't want to be sexual. But Jon, what I often see, and this is so sad, is an unworkable contract that goes something like this, it never gets spoken, but it goes something like this: I expect you to be monogamous. 

00:48:35
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:48:35
PAT LOVE But don't expect me to meet your sexual needs. And that's an unworkable contract, without resentment. That if I expect my partner to be faithful, to be monogamous, then somehow I believe it's part of my commitment and my responsibly to my partner and my relationship to be willing to meet some of his needs, some of the time. 

00:49:05
JON CARLSON Well, how does this work out. I mean, we talked before about this high-T, low-T. Got any help with us for that? 

00:49:10
PAT LOVE Right. Right. Got lots of help for that. Because first of all, if you're the high-T person, you've gotta become an expert in arousing your partner. If you're the high-T person, you've got to honor your partner's preconditions. See, if you have a moderate or high-level of testosterone, then literally, you don't need a lot of foreplay, often times. You don't need a lot of warm-up. Y-- you just really need permission and a willing partner, often times. However, for the low-T person, that's not the case at all. Because you really do need either the help around the house, or the kind talking, or the touching, or the contact, or the time together, you literally do, that's why I say give me something to work with here. So the high-T person, even though it's not your need, you need to honor your partner's preconditions. If you're a low-T person, you have to become an expert in your own arousal. You have to take some responsibility. I have to figure out, as a low-T person, what do I need to do to put myself in the mood. What do I need to do to be receptive? And I have to also be willing to tell my partner this. And if it's hard to talk about, you can write a little love note. You can, you can often times, just with gestures and, and wonderful sounds, you can let your partner know. But this needs to be not only negotiated with each other, you gotta let each other know, but you've gotta update this information on an ongoing basis. Because no matter how good your, your love life is, doing the same thing over and over and over will lose its zip over time. Now, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. If it's working for you. But you need to check in with each other. And it may be that neither of you are very interested in sex and that's fine. It's just that you've gotta be on the same page around this and if you're the low-T person, you have to-- remember, I said there are two pathways to arousal. One is the autogenic, but the other's the psychogenic, and I understand now, for myself, that I have to really be responsible for that, and put myself in the mood. Let, let me say just one thing, one more thing about this. What the low-T person, you know, I said earlier that I took testosterone for 90 days, under a watchful care of my physician. And, and I took strong doses of testosterone and I got the experience of what it's like to have sex drive. It is a very different experience to have sex drive and not have sex drive. And what the low-T person doesn't, cannot understand, without experience, about the high-T person, is how physically uncomfortable it is to go without release. How emotionally uncomfortable it is. How, how psychologically uncomfortable it is. I had no idea how it interfered with my life. I thought about sex, I fantasized about sex, I made sexual innuendos, I looked at men in sexual terms. That was a new experience for me. I really did have a very different experience, and it gave me a sensitivity. Because what happens is that the pressure builds up and it just then, become, it preoccupied my mind. And it was physically uncomfortable. So what the low-T person is-- 

00:52:25
JON CARLSON I think you've got it. 

00:52:30
PAT LOVE Have I got it? 

00:52:30
JON CARLSON You got it. Mm-hmm. 

00:52:30
PAT LOVE Does it sound, does it sound-- And what the low-T person, that's not the low-T person's experience. So you've got to be willing to hear the other person's reality, that's why I spent so much time talking about consciousness. Romance. 

00:52:40
JON CARLSON Yeah, let's get onto the romance. 

00:52:40
PAT LOVE Romance is simply proof positive that you care for me. And the more you know me, the more specific your romantic gestures need to be. For example, if you bring me roses on our first date, I think that's sweet and it's roman-- it's romantic. But if later on, I tell you, you know, I'm allergic to roses, and then you still bring me roses, that isn't romantic. So you've gotta be watching me, and find out what is romantic. 

00:53:10
JON CARLSON I bring roses home, my wife wants to know what I've been up to. 

00:53:15
PAT LOVE There you go. There you go. 

00:53:15
JON CARLSON But if I bring home some daisies, or something, it's a very romantic gesture. 

00:53:20
PAT LOVE Very romantic. So it needs to be specific to the person. 

00:53:20
JON CARLSON Right. 

00:53:20
PAT LOVE Needs to be specific to the person. So you need to be thinking about what would my partner, what would say, "I love you," to my partner. And if you don't know, don't be afraid to ask, but the main thing is you become a detective. So playfulness. 

00:53:35
JON CARLSON Playful, yeah, let's 

00:53:35
PAT LOVE This is where you, and this is really hard for a lot of people because we were taught act your age. You know, when you were told act your age, what they really meant was you were probably acting your age and they meant, oh, act older than your age. And so we don't have permission often to take a risk and to be playful and to be childlike. When you fall in love you do this. You even go to the playground, you know. You, you do silly things. You buy little teddy bears and give 'em to each other. I mean, you, you develop love symbols. You know, if, for example, if, if I fell in love in, around Chicago in the fall, you know, maybe the Sears Tower would be the symbol of our love, and I would sign my name and put the little Sears Tower, you know, and find a card with the Sears Tower. 

00:54:20
JON CARLSON Sounds, sounds kinda Freudian to me, but, yeah. 

00:54:20
PAT LOVE Right. Exactly. But what we know is, is, uh, being playful is a big risk and it bonds two people together. So that's what I'm talking about when I talk about chemistry. 

00:54:30
JON CARLSON Well can you, do you have something that we can do to, to maybe to personalize these four things? 

00:54:35
Loving Sexuality Activity Would you like it 

00:54:35
PAT LOVE Absolutely. We're gonna do an exercise to put this to the test. 

00:54:40
JON CARLSON Okay, good. How will we do that? Do we need a, a volunteer couple? 

00:54:45
PAT LOVE We get a volunteer couple, will come up and we'll show 'em how to do it. 

00:54:50
JON CARLSON Good. 

00:54:55
[music] 

00:54:55
"Would You Like It" exercise Sender Begins by asking the question: 1. "In terms of physical affection, would you like it if IÉÉ? Receiver Receiver simply answers "yes," or "no." 

00:54:55
"Would You Like It" exercise Continue to ask questions until you get three "yes" answers, then move on to question #2. 

00:54:55
"Would You Like It" exercise Sender Begins by asking the question: 1. "In terms of sexuality, would you like it if IÉÉ? Receiver Continues to answer "yes or "no." 

00:55:00
PAT LOVE This is a simple exercise to help you understand what it is that says, "I love you," to your partner. And to help you update your information about what says, "I love you." It's simply called, "Would you like itÉ" So we have Frank and Bev who've volunteered to help us demonstrate this. And let me just explain. It's simple and it can actually be quite fun and rewarding. So, Frank, you're gonna say, "Would you like it if." "In terms of physical affection, would you like it if." And then Bev is just simply gonna say, "Yes" or "No." And again, you're gonna try to just get simply three yeses. So all you have to say is yes or no, and then later you can explain if it's one of these, okay? 

00:55:35
BEV Okay. 

00:55:35
PAT LOVE If it's sort of like, "Oh, well, maybe," later you can explain. 

00:55:35
BEV Okay. 

00:55:35
PAT LOVE And then you're gonna go to, um, next one is just sexuality. In terms of sexuality. Thinking of Bev. So, you're really not just trying to get three yeses, you're trying to discover if this is something she would really like. And knowing what says, for example, for me, a sexual turn-on, as I said earlier, is if you vacuum or if you help me around the house. So you've got to think of what would be sexually interesting for Bev. It may not be sexually interesting for you, but you're really trying to discover the key to her heart. 

00:56:10
JON CARLSON It's, you know, it's not even on my long list. 

00:56:10
PAT LOVE Not even on your long list. 

00:56:10
JON CARLSON Not even only my long list, no. 

00:56:15
"Would You Like It" exercise Sender Begins by asking the question: 1. "In terms of romance, would you like it if IÉÉ? Receiver Continues to answer "yes or "no." 

00:56:15
"Would You Like It" exercise Sender Begins by asking the question: 1. "In terms of playfulness, would you like it if IÉÉ? Receiver Continues to answer "yes or "no." 

00:56:15
"Would You Like It" exercise Receiver summarizes by saying: "Of all the suggestions you've made, my favorite wasÉ.. Thank you." 

00:56:15
PAT LOVE And again, we're going back to getting into the reality of your partner. That's it. Then we're gonna say, "In terms of romance, Bev, Would you like it ifÉ Would you like it if." And then the last one is, "In terms of playfulness, would you like it ifÉ I took us out to a movie once a week. Or if I went, uh, invited you on a date?" Whatever it is would say, "I love you," to Bev. And then at the end, you're just gonna say, "You know, of all the things you've mentioned, what I would like best isÉ" And then you're just gonna thank him. Okay? And if you need help, I'll jump right in, or Jon will jump in, and give you some help. Any questions? 

00:56:50
BEV So, what was the last one again, the what I like best? Out of all he said? 

00:56:50
PAT LOVE Yeah, you're gonna listening, yeah, you're gonna listen. And at the end you're just gonna say, you know, "Of all the things you asked me about, the one that really stood out to me that I'd like the most isÉ" So you give him sort of a priority list here. And you just have to pick one. 

00:57:05
BEV Okay. 

00:57:05
PAT LOVE Okay? All right. Let's just start, take it from the top. 

00:57:10
FRANK Okay, um. In terms of physical affection, would you like if I gave you, uh, massaged your head? 

00:57:25
BEV No. 

00:57:30
FRANK Okay. In terms of physical affection would you like it if I, um, just gave you a pat on the back, every now and then. 

00:57:45
BEV No. 

00:57:45
FRANK Okay. In terms of physical affection. Do you know what I'm talking about? 

00:57:50
BEV Yes, I, yes, I -- there are things I like better. 

00:58:00
FRANK This isn't sex. Okay. Would you like it if I, um, I don't know, held your hand? 

00:58:15
BEV Yes. 

00:58:15
FRANK Okay. 

00:58:15
JON CARLSON Two more. 

00:58:20

00:58:30
BEV No. 

00:58:30
FRANK Okay. In terms of physical affection, would you like it if I give you more space? 

00:58:45
BEV No. 

00:58:50
FRANK What do you want? 

00:58:50
PAT LOVE Why this is, it's really good, it's why the exercise is really important, yeah. Yeah. 

00:58:55
FRANK In, in terms of physical affection would you like it if I, um, just, scratch that itch, whatever you have, on your back sometimes? 

00:59:10
BEV Okay. That'd be good. 

00:59:15
FRANK Okay, in terms of physical affection would you like it if I, uh, massaged your arms?

00:59:45
 Okay. 

00:59:45
PAT LOVE Yeah. 

00:59:50
FRANK Let me think of questions. In terms of sexuality would you l ike it if I, um, let you, um, made you more aware of my wanting sex? 

01:00:10
BEV Yes. 

01:00:10
FRANK In terms of sexuality, would you like it if I, uh, asked you more if you wanted sex? 

01:00:20
BEV Yes. 

01:00:25

01:01:40
[sil.] 

01:01:50
BEV Yes. 

01:01:50
PAT LOVE Okay. Doing well. Okay, what about the third one. Yeah. You're really showing how difficult this is, and it is. It's simple and it's difficult. Okay, on terms of romance. 

01:02:05
FRANK Okay, in terms of romance, would you like it if I sent you a card every now and then? 

01:02:15
BEV No. 

01:02:20
FRANK In terms of romance, would you like it if I surprised you more? 

01:02:25
BEV Yes. 

01:02:25
FRANK In terms of romance, would you like it if, uh, I, um, did more things like, uh, take you out to dinner moew?

01:03:15
BEV Yes. 

01:03:20
JON CARLSON Okay, you're onto the fourth one. 

01:03:20
FRANK Okay, in terms of playfulness, would you like it if I, uh, tickled you more? 

01:03:35
BEV No. I don't like to be tickled. 

01:03:40
FRANK In terms of playfulness, would you like it if, uh. I'm not sure what playfulness is, like, uh... 

01:03:50
PAT LOVE Anything that gets your energy up. 

01:03:55
FRANK Just energy. 

01:03:55
PAT LOVE That's positive for, yeah, it's like, it's almost like, child-like. 

01:03:55
FRANK Okay. 

01:03:55
PAT LOVE You know, sort of fun, makes you laugh. 

01:04:00
FRANK Okay, okay, in terms of playfulness would you like it more if we just were, you know, spontaneously running around, doing things? 

01:04:10
BEV Yeah. 

01:04:10
FRANK Okay. In terms of playfulness, would you like it if I, um, bought you like something, um, kind of meaningless, but uh, little, just a token? 

01:04:30
BEV Yes. 

01:04:30
FRANK Okay. In terms of playfulness would you like if I, uh, stopped asking you questions. No, in terms of playfulness, would you like it if... 

01:04:45
BEV (inaudible ) 

01:04:50
PAT LOVE In the first place, would you like if it what? 

01:04:50
FRANK Uh, in terms of playfulness, would you like it more if, uh, I was sillier? 

01:05:00
BEV More sillier than you are now? 

01:05:05
FRANK Is that possible? 

01:05:10
[sil.] 

01:05:15
BEV No. 

01:05:15
 No, okay. 

01:05:15
PAT LOVE He's too, you're too, too silly already. 

01:05:20
FRANK In terms of playfulness, would you like it, if, uh, I was more, uh, structured, like, this is our bowling night, or something. 

01:05:35
BEV No. 

01:05:35
FRANK In terms of playfulness, would you like more if there was more activities, if we did more activities? 

01:05:45
BEV Yes. 

01:05:45
PAT LOVE Okay, yes. 

01:05:45
JON CARLSON You did this. Okay. Good work. 

01:05:50
PAT LOVE And you began to see that. 

01:05:50
JON CARLSON You were on a roll there at the end. 

01:05:50
PAT LOVE You really begin to see where you, it takes some thought, it takes some time to discover. Okay, so of all the things that Frank meant, mentioned. 

01:06:00
BEV Which one did I like the best? 

01:06:00
PAT LOVE Yes, which stood out to you that you would like the best. 

01:06:05
BEV Just there, in, in all ways, just being there, you know, present with me. Emotionally, physically and mentally. For me. 

01:06:15
FRANK And what's, what would that do for you, like in things for. I mean, for you. 

01:06:20
JON CARLSON Sexually, sensually. 

01:06:20
FRANK What would it do for you? 

01:06:25
JON CARLSON Romantically. 

01:06:25
PAT LOVE Being present? Is that what you're... 

01:06:25
BEV Yeah, and just that you're, and real with everything, you know. That you wanted everything, you know. It, um, it would just be g--, it would just be better for me, I think. I would feel more ready to do whatever you wanted. 

01:06:40
FRANK All right! 

01:06:45
PAT LOVE So this is where you just say-- 

01:06:45
JON CARLSON This is the key to her heart, Frank. 

01:06:45
BEV Yeah, but it's just gonna, it has to be a whole thing, you know? 

01:06:45
PAT LOVE Yes. 

01:06:45
BEV It, it's everything, has to be connected. 

01:06:50
FRANK So it's like all four. 

01:06:50
PAT LOVE yes 

01:06:50
FRANK In one. Okay. 

01:06:50
PAT LOVE Rolled into one. And this is where you just thank him in the way that you, means the most to you. 

01:07:00
BEV You mean, specifically? 

01:07:00
PAT LOVE You just say thank you, you can just say thank you. 

01:07:05
BEV Oh, okay, well thank you for expressing, um... 

01:07:05
FRANK I take checks. 

01:07:05
BEV For letting me know. I appreciate you wanting to know what, what makes me happy and feel better about myself. Thank you for considering me. 

01:07:20
JON CARLSON The "Would you like it" exercise looked deceptively simple when we started it, but it looked like our studio audience was challenged by this. What happened when you guys did it? 

01:07:30
CONNIE I was just gonna say that it seems like it would be just so much easier if he'd just tell me what it is that he likes, instead of me having to guess. But what I, what I felt was that there was something really powerful in his struggle to understand what I liked instead of me just telling me. Um, it gave me more of a connection, and an appreciate for him wanting to try to understand me. 

01:07:55
PAT LOVE You're, you're actually making the point of the exercise, Connie. Because if I believe I know what you want, you can tell me, I won't listen. It's like, if I watch, uh, uh, someone from my field, and they're, and I'm listening and I hear, and I think well I already know that, I don't even listen, I tune out. So part of the hidden agenda of the exercise is to show you what you don't know. And the struggle, you're right, is bonding because you begging to see how much he really does wanna know. But if I believe I know what you want, what I probably know is what I want. So the hidden agenda of the exercise was to help you to see that maybe you don't know so clearly. 

01:08:35
JON CARLSON You know, again, I'm still back to that vacuum cleaning. Boy. 

01:08:40
PAT LOVE There you, he's stuck on that. 

01:08:40
 I, I felt some of the, the strong surprise on a couple answers where I downright thought 110% she was gonna answer yes or no, and it turned out to be the other answer. 

01:08:55
JON CARLSON Wow. 

01:08:55
 And it's actions or you know motions that we've gone through over and over but yet we found out that there was actually a no to it. And then on the other end, finding out that we both afterwards felt the playfulness was our strongest attribute. And we both realized we were able to come up with answers that were just very easy and couldn't find a no answer on, uh, on our in our actions. 

01:09:20
PAT LOVE So it showed you your strengths as well as some of your misconceptions. 

01:09:25
 Right. 

01:09:25
PAT LOVE Uh-huh. Someone else, what was that like, doing it. 

01:09:30
FRANK Well, just when we were up there, doing our examples, I was thrown for a loop when she said no to something that I was sure would be a yes. 

01:09:40
PAT LOVE Yes, yes, yes. 

01:09:40
FRANK So, that kind of, I had to, uh, rethink everything and everything. It just seemed, it, it was frustrating a little bit because you don't wanna, I didn't wanna admit that I didn't know some things. 

01:10:00
JON CARLSON Well, and the yes no forces an answer too, so you can't say, "Well, maybe," or, "Sometimes." 

01:10:05
PAT LOVE Or explain. 

01:10:05
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:10:10
PAT LOVE So thank you for saying that because it is uncomfortable when I get a no, when I was so certain. And there, there's a fear around that, or an embarrassment. That I really, here I am living with this person and I can't get a yes. And so thank you for saying that because that's important, really important, that I think I know, and that also stops me from asking or trying something new out of that fear that I'll get a no. So, we'll just go ahead and get it over with. Anyone else. What it was like. What you learned. 

01:10:40
HANK It just struck me that this is, um, a helpful protection against taking the other person for granted. Just assuming everything and it being kind of, uh, even dull. Uh, but there's a discovery process in this that's kind of fun, and it puts life into it. 

01:10:55
JON CARLSON What about compatibility? 

01:10:55
Loving Sexuality Exercise 3 Compatibility 

01:10:55
PAT LOVE Okay. 

01:11:00
JON CARLSON How about take us into the third area. 

01:11:00
PAT LOVE Okay, compatibility. Compatibil-- compatibility is really about how well you get along, at home, out in public, uh, in society. It's about being best friends. And again, I said earlier that what research shows is that the friendship and how compatible you are is what carries you through time. And, and, and it's no surprise that research has really shown us that the predictors of divorce and instability are literally connected to people who aren't friendly. We found that couples who really love each other and are satisfied and get along and stay together actually do hundreds of wonderful, loving little positive activities and glances and nuances between each other every single day. 

01:11:50
JON CARLSON I read somewhere that there's 250 opportunities every day to do that. 

01:11:50
PAT LOVE Wow. Wow. 

01:11:55
JON CARLSON 250 opportunities to show that you care, or to make that point. 

01:12:00
PAT LOVE Yes. So this is what compatibility is really like, is how well, how, how are you to get along with? I mean, think about it, what's it like living with you? Are you kind? Do you treat your partner kindly? There, uh, many of you are familiar with, uh, Jon Gottman and his associates, predictors of divorce and separation. And basically, he found, that criticism, defensiveness, withdrawal or stonewalling, and contempt. If you have all of these in your relationship, that you're actually, the chances of you staying together are almost slim and none, I mean like six out of 100%, six chances out 100 you'll stay together, if you have those predictors. And that's about being unfriendly. It's just like, you're not fun to live with. And we also know that the man heeding the wife, the wife, or the woman's advice is a strong predictor of being stale, and being happy, because we know that womenÉ 

01:12:55
JON CARLSON Wait, wait, say that again. 

01:12:55
PAT LOVE Yes, the man heeding. 

01:13:00
JON CARLSON No, you put that, real quick. 

01:13:00
PAT LOVE I did not make this up. I did not make this up. The man heeding the advice of the woman, taking her into consideration, really listing to her, is a predictor of success, and happiness. We know that women often listen, in fact, to a fault, too much to men at times. That's what his research showed. So women already listen to men and take the man into account. What we also need is parity. Equality. Where both people really count. And that you, that the, the, the relationship and the marriage supports both people. That some point also somewhere along the line in your relationship that you'll support each other's dreams, for example. That at some point I will sacrifice for perhaps my husband to go back to school, or for him to take a job that he really likes and then he'll do the same for me. And then equal relationship, if you've got this equal relationship. 

01:13:50
JON CARLSON So, so we're supposed to, men are supposed to let women tell us what to do. And we're supposed to do it willingly? 

01:14:00
PAT LOVE Right, you're supposed to take, take my advice into consideration. 

01:14:00
JON CARLSON Okay. 

01:14:00
PAT LOVE It's not that you do it all the time, but you've gotta take my advice. 

01:14:05
JON CARLSON We're almost trained against that though, because we supposed to be in charge. And we're supposed to... 

01:14:10
PAT LOVE I know. I know. And if you can imagine what it's like living with someone year after year when your opinion does count. If you've ever been in a job, where your opinion didn't count. In fact, it's not of the top five reasons why people leave jobs. It's because they feel like they don't matter, they feel like they don't count, they feel like they're not heard. It's not, it's not always that I want you to follow it. I just wanna her, uh, be heard. I wanna go on record as being heard. I wanna count. I don't want to be invisible in this relationship. 

01:14:40
JON CARLSON So that probably wasn't doing much for a low-T person, was it? If you weren't heeding their advice. 

01:14:50
PAT LOVE No. That, that's true, that's true. 

01:14:50
JON CARLSON And they didn't have a voice, and by giving them a voice, that would really be helpful. 

01:14:50
Loving Sexuality Activity Connect the dots 

01:14:50
Connect the Dots Exercise Work as a team--avoiding all criticism, defensiveness, withdrawal or contempt, and connect all nine dots, without lifting your pen, using only 4 straight lines. 

01:14:55
PAT LOVE It's very helpful. So what we'd like to do is, there's, there's actually a little exercise. I think you have a copy of it. And, it's, you've probably seen this exercise and all it is is you've got to follow the instructions. It's just nine dots on a piece of paper. And I'm going to ask you to do this little task as a couple. Because maybe one of you knows how to do it. Maybe neither of you knows, knows how to do it. But what the directions say is simply to connect all nine dots without lifting your pen, using only four straight lines. And without name calling, or being contemptuous, and also listening to one another's advice. So take, take time, see if you can follow the instructions and see how many of you can get it done, and let us know when you've finished. And I'd like you also to try this at home. Take the nine dots, do the exercise without using those predictors, those negative behaviors. 

01:15:50
Loving Sexuality Please pause your VCR & try this yourselves. 

01:15:55
[music] 

01:16:55
JON CARLSON Well how did it work? Were you able to work as a team and were you able to avoid those four things that destroy relationships? The defensiveness and criticism and contempt and withdrawal? Were you able to do teamwork? How would you rate it if we were to look maybe on a scale from one being very low and 10 being, you know, uh, the world-championship team. What number would you give yourselves in terms of teamwork? 

01:17:30
CONNIE I think that we, we probably worked at an eight, maybe, on a scale of one to 10. Um, cuz, I saw Hank's strength in this. You know, Hank's a visual person, whereas you know, to me, I wanna throw, it's impossible, there's no way to connect these nine dots. Um, and, and Hank was able to look past the boundary lines and, and, um, and it felt good being able to take a lead from him. Um, and in being able to get past my own shortcomings. 

01:18:00
HANK and I was thinking that I'd ordinarily, uh, I had to make allowance to, uh, include Connie. Cuz if, if I'm working on something, a lot of times I just have my ideas. One of the things I was conscious of, I had, I was trying to, uh, encourage her to hold off before we put any marks on the paper. You know, I said, let's trace this a couple times just to see. Cuz she was gonna start marking it up and I thought now, I mean we're gonna not get this if we start marking it. I mean, so I was conscious of that. But, uh, it was hard for me to, I had to make a decision to include her right from the beginning. 

01:18:35
PAT LOVE That, that's really a good point. Yes, Bev. 

01:18:35
BEV I think we had a ten which I was really surprised about. 

01:18:40
PAT LOVE Ahhh. 

01:18:40
BEV Because I tend to think he's smarter than me. So I sometimes let him just do it and I follow him, but this time I got right in there, it was really weird, and I just didn't even think about him, I just, I did it, and he's like "yeah." You know, so it was kind of a re--, a role reversal. So that was that's something I'll have to work on, you know. 

01:19:00
FRANK And that was the difficult part, accepting our success. Cuz we just, first try, she says, "Well do this, do that." And then, well, did it and I said, "Yeah, it did work." 

01:19:10
PAT LOVE Ah. 

01:19:10
BEV Yeah, it was a good... 

01:19:10
PAT LOVE So you surprised yourselves. Working as a team, and it surprised you. 

01:19:15
BEV Yeah. We don't do that very much. 

01:19:20
FRANK No. 

01:19:20
JON CARLSON What, what did you notice about yourselves. You've sort of told us a little bit aboutÉ Well, what did you notice about yourselves as individuals on this activity. Bev took a different role, and you realized that you were able to defer to an opposite role. 

01:19:40
 Well, I was able to, when we were doing this, is I will have a habit of if I have a response, like I kinda knew what the answer was on this already. So I had to try to find a way to explain to Lisa how to do it instead of going, "Hey, here you go, this is what, it's done." Which is very difficult for me. I'd rather just jump in, do it, let's get it done. Instead of trying to explain and enlighten her and let her discover the response. 

01:20:05
JON CARLSON That's a gender problem, I think we, I share that with you. You know, I wanna get it, get it done at all costs and, uh, yeah. 

01:20:10
HANK I was jut thinking as, uh, you made that comment, I was just thinking about the time crunch we live under. And inclusion of someone else is not very efficient. And so it's another excuse to take a shortcut or not spend that time to develop a partnership. 

01:20:30
PAT LOVE Right, exactly. And, and not every task would you want to do as a partnership, but the point of the exercise and the whole idea of compatibility, is what is the glue that holds your relationships together? How do you get connected, stay connected. What is it that keeps the positive energy? Because you've gotta get, be above the line. Tou gotta get above that 50% line to be above-average. Somehow that this relationships feels better. There was a big study about Fortune 500 companies and what they found was that culturally, we've shifted so many of our loyalties and support systems and social systems from the home to the office to the workplace. That that's where we're getting so many of our needs met. So if you wanna keep your relationship alive there has to be something putting energy into it and joint activities and friendliness and getting along and working or playing as a team is a big part of it. So it's a very good point. The time crunch, we have to have job distribution. However, there have to be points that the two of you come together. 

01:21:35
JON CARLSON Was there any part of this that was really difficult for you? 

01:21:40
 I, I need to just say, uh, don't try to do it by yourself, just turn to her, and do it right away together. Because as soon as I got it, I was like okay, I'll get this by myself. I don't need her to help me do this. And I didn't do it by myself, so I ended up turning around and we ended up figuring it out together. So. 

01:22:00
PAT LOVE Yes, when you were mentioning earlier about it being a gender issue, I was really relating to, if I see it, I just wanna go ahead and do it. And then I have to get, again, it's that consciousness. What is it like living with me when I jump in and always think I'm right or when I figure it out, I don't even include my partner. What is that like living with me? We go back to that one word, lonely. Feeling invisible. 

01:22:25
JON CARLSON Sure. 

01:22:25
PAT LOVE So, thank you. That's an important point to make. 

01:22:30
HANK I think I fluctuate, or have in our, in the history of our relationship. When we partner together and we have a success, uh, then I need her. But if things get snagged and I'm feeing frustrated, then I think, that's what leds, uh, leads me to pursue the withdraw. I don't need her. Now I'm gonna clean this up by doing more on my own. It's a flip flopping that's very frustrating and it, you know, to move forward on this and get the hang of this will help a lot. 

01:22:55
JON CARLSON This compatibility is really important. I mean it's probably, you know, that we work together. Are there any tips that you have? I mean, is there some kinda 

01:23:05
PAT LOVE Yeah, yeah. 

01:23:05
JON CARLSON How do we get started at making this kind of a change? 

01:23:05
PAT LOVE Yeah. One of the things I talk about, the third force in relationships. And I, what research shows is that it's important for me to support my partner in his passions, and at some point it's important for him to support me in my, pursuing my passion. However, at different points in our relationship, there needs to be a confluence. There needs to be a coming together where we share passions. Where we share activities. You can't share them all. Like if, if, you know, he really likes golf. It's not my passion. And so I support him in pursuing his passion. I really enjoy, uh, working on the computer. It's not his passion, he supports me. But there has to be a point where we come together. So think about an activity that, number one, when you're doing it you lose track of time. You look up and you go, "Oh my gosh, it's noon. Where did the time go?" The second thing is this activity challenges you. It may be physically challenging as well as mentally or emotionally challenging. That it's, it really stretches you. And the third things is that, that, um, when you're finished with it, you may be tired, but it energizes you. That you real, it really does give you energy. And the fourth thing is that, that when you're doing it, you're totally involved and engrossed. You're, you're at one with the experience. You're not distracted, you're not thinking, "Well, I need to be doing this, or I need to be doing that." And the fifth things that you ask yourself is when you're doing this activity, you get the sense that this is exactly what I need to be to doing. Yes! So, that's your passion. Whatever you and, whatever activity will meet these five criteria really is your passion. And it's important for individuals to have a passion, but it's also important, at different types in your, times in your life, that you and your partner share a passion. Whether it's sex or golf or, or gardening or dancing or skiing or the, or the children or, or, um, playing soccer, whatever it is, or playing cards, or, whatever it is that you two, share that. Because that is a bonding moment, and it'll keep a relationship alive or a long, long time. 

01:25:15
JON CARLSON So we get started by looking for just what those passions could be. 

01:25:15
PAT LOVE Yes, yes. 

01:25:25
JON CARLSON We need to move on to the final segment, that of commitment. But before we do that, how do you put these, these dots together? 

01:25:30
PAT LOVE Yeah. 

01:25:30
JON CARLSON Is there some secret? 

01:25:30
PAT LOVE Yes. We're gonna show you. Actually, we're gonna show you how to do it with four lines. You can actually do it with one line if you have a real thick line. Just a one thick line. Another way you can do it with one line is to fold the paper. Cuz the instructions don't say you can't fold the paper. So you can actually fold the paper so the dots touch, and you can just take one line and draw it through all the dots. 

01:25:55
JON CARLSON So I've got to change my-- 

01:25:55
PAT LOVE You've gotta change your thinking. Get out of the box. 

01:26:00
JON CARLSON That's the point of it all of this. 

01:26:00
PAT LOVE That's the whole point. You've gotta change your thinking and if you can shift and begin to see your partner differently. See your partner and your relationship in a positive light, begin to look for the positives in your partner. Begin to, because, what, in fact, I hear this most from men by the way, Jon. They say, "You know, I do ten things wrong, I, I don't hear about it. The one thing I do wrong, that's the one thing I hear about." And if you're looking to catch your partner in the act of doing something wrong, that's what contempt is really about. That means, I've made up my mind about you and it's not good. And when I am looking for meanness, or withdrawal, I will see it. So, that's what this whole segment has been about, which is changing your perception. Because techniques are great, and if I can shift my perception, everything will change. And it's a permanent change. So if I can really get it, I really do have a partner here. I really do have somebody who can support me, not only in the good times, but the bad. As you were saying, Hank, you know, when times get rough, I pull into myself. If I can really get it, wait a minute. She really does wanna help me. That's a new perception. So. I can get excited about this. 

01:27:10
JON CARLSON Well, how about getting excited about the last part? 

01:27:15
PAT LOVE Yes, yes. 

01:27:15
Loving Sexuality Exercise 4 Commitment 

01:27:15
JON CARLSON Now, let's move onto commitment. 

01:27:15
PAT LOVE Yes. And I wanna look at three types of commitment. First type of commitment is just committed to your partner. I'm gonna be here, I'm gonna show up. You can count on me. I'll be faithful. I'll contribute my share. And that's, that the basic commitment. Just showing up. But the second type of commitment that I mentioned earlier. 

01:27:35
JON CARLSON Yeah, I've got that one. 

01:27:35
PAT LOVE You've got that one. The second type, by the way, is really the commitment to the relationship. That I'm not only committed to you and I'm gonna be faithful and I'm going to be here, and you can count on me and we'll go to family gatherings together and we'll maybe parent children together or we'll live in the house together. But you can count on me to do my share in improving this relationship. Now that's another level of commitment. You know, some people just say, "Listen, I told you I loved you when I married you. If it changes, I'll let you know." You know, or, uh, "I'm showing up, that's all I'm signing up for." What's interesting is couples often don't talk about this ahead of time. They don't talk about, well, what are you really signing on for? Are you signing-- there, and there are assumptions made and they're not always accurate. Because some people figure, this is what is, this is what I'm signing up for, just to be here. I'm not signing up for being intimate or meeting your needs or helping you heal your childhood wounds, or whatever your agenda might be. Or, or, yes, we had a lot of sex in the beginning but I'm not that interested right now. So you've gotta know that are you committed to the relationship. And that's where you in tough times, you step back and you ask the question. What's best for the relationship. What's the best thing for us? What, what do we need to do? Cuz it may not be best for me. And when I get in a tough spot and I wanna win, or I want you to really understand my point-of-view, I've gotta say, "What is best for the relationship?" Like I've had, I have a hot temper, and, and I actually, and I know I can control that. I mean, obviously I can, because I control it in public, I control it in airports and, you know, other places. And, and it used to be I would just give myself permission to just let it rip. You know, I was being "honest," you know. But it was setting back my relationship, it wasn't fun living with me. And I really made a commitment to my partner, you know what, I'm not gonna go there. Cuz what we know is the angrier you are, the angrier you are. That rage begets rate. It's like a slippery slope. The more you go there, the more you go there. And I realized that I really am, I'm making a commitment, I'm not gonna go there. And I made a conscious decision, I don't want be that way. Not just for my relationship, but for me. My own integrity, and also how I feel about myself when I do that. So making a commitment to the relationship is the sep--, second type. The third type of the commit, of commitment is, commitment means that you have the right to expect me to meet some of your needs at least some of the time. But the problem is you don't know which needs. And the fear of rejection, the more your partner means to you, the greater the fear around rejection or abandonment or being left out or the withdrawal, or the criticism. That's why if your best friend's late, it's not a big deal, but if your partner's late, it is a big deal because they mean more in many ways and they're tied to your security. So what we know is that we've gotta come together on this and really look at what is it that you expect? What is it that I'm signing up for in this relationship. So there's actually a little exercise that we--

01:30:55
PAT LOVE --can do. And if you just take a sheet of paper. And by yourself, I'd like you to think about these four areas. If you had to describe your ideal relationship. Individually, without talking to your partner at this point. You could describe it, and, and I want you to describe it in terms of consciousness. In other words, in terms of understanding your partner's point-of-view. How would you describe your ideal relationship? It might go something like, when we get into conflict, we stop and make a point to understand the other person's point-of-view. So you would, in terms of consciousness. That's the first category, consciousness. Or, we listen to each other one at a time when we get into conflict. We take turns listening to each other. Or, we, uh, we honor each other needs, even when they're different than our own. So you, what are you willing to do, what would you ideal relationship look like if you both were aware and got over the self-centeredness I talked about earlier. If you both were aware that there's another person in this relationship. So what would it look like. Just start each sentence with, "We." We consider each other's needs and honor some of these needs. That might be a statement around that consciousness. 

01:32:20
JON CARLSON And do this for consciousness. 

01:32:20
PAT LOVE Consciousness. 

01:32:20
JON CARLSON And then for chemistry. 

01:32:20
Commitment List for Couple Consciousness Chemistry Compatibility Commitment 

01:32:20
PAT LOVE Compat--, chemistry, and then compatibility and then commitment. And then you write it down individually, and then we're gonna do something with that. 

01:32:30
Loving Sexuality Please pause your VCR & try this yourselves. 

01:32:30
JON CARLSON Do that at home as well. 

01:32:30
PAT LOVE Do that at home. Just write it on a sheet of paper. 

01:32:35

01:32:35
Commitment List for Couple Look at each person's list and take each statement you both agree with and put it on this agreement. Feel free to add any items that come to mind. 

01:32:40
PAT LOVE Now that you've made your list, your wish list, so to speak, your commitment list for you and your partner in your relationship, I'd like you to work with your partner to actually combine the two lists. So what I would do is I would take my list and look at every statement that I've written. And every statement that my partner agrees with would actually go on our joint list. So you'd take a second sheet of paper. Or, you know, there are handouts in your video package, but I don't know about you, I usually throw those things away. I hope you didn't, but if you have your handout, there's a handout in the, that came with the video that you can use. But if you didn't, it's okay, because you just, you've made your list. You take a separate sheet of paper and then every item that I wrote that my partner agrees with, you put it on your joint list. So you look at your list and then you have every item that your partner agrees with you on, you put it on your joint list. And then, you look at your partner's list, and every item that your partner wrote that you agree with, you put it on the joint list. Now if you've realized that, I couldn't get anything for compatibility. I forgot what that is. I didn't know what to say about friendship. Then the two of you can talk about this. Well, what could we do that would make us feel like better friends. Maybe if we, we have a date once a week. We have a date once a month. If you're in a time crunch, you have young children, it's hard sometimes. That this is a temporary period of time when you really do have to focus on the children. So you look at the areas of consciousness we talked about earlier, that, we really make it a point to understand the other person's point-of-view. Compatibility is how we develop our friendship. What we do. How kind we are to each other. For example, when we are harsh or rude or unkind, we apologize. That would be a way, a statement about developing our friendship. When we're at home, we have a, one project that we finish before we start another one. That we finish this job we've started in the kitchen before we start another project. That would be around compatibility. And then this whole idea about, uh. So we've got consciousness, we've got chemistry. We've gotta look at chemistry. How, what do you wanna do about your sexual relationship? This is so important because this is a very delicate area for couples. So what is that I have the right to ask for. Uh, it's almost like a "yes list." In my book, Hot Monogamy, I have a exercise called the Yes List. What is on the yes list? What is is that my partner can ask for just about any time and the answer is yes? Because that fear of rejection. If you've ever lived with that fear of rejection. It's really, really frightening. You know, I tell the story of, uh, uh, what I call a TMM, a temporary moment of maturity, where I sort of like, got it. What is was like living with me. And this happened years and years ago, but I was, I came out of the shower and I was actually, I'd toweled off. My husband was lying in bed and I lay down and I was lying there thinking, "Well, it'd be sorta nice if he would reach out and initiate loveplay, or sex, or whatever." And all of a sudden, it hit me. What it must be like lying on the other side of the bed. Never knowing when you reach out, if you're gonna be accepted or rejected. Because when I reached out, the answer was always yes. But when he reached out, he never knew. And when I tried that on, what that rejection felt like, I didn't like it. 

01:36:20
JON CARLSON Just like a slap machine, you know, versus a telephone that always works. 

01:36:20
PAT LOVE Yeah. 

01:36:25
JON CARLSON I mean, yeah. 

01:36:25
PAT LOVE Yeah. It was just like a gutshot. 

01:36:25
JON CARLSON A gamble. 

01:36:25
PAT LOVE And so what is it in terms of sexuality that you can say, here I'm gonna be honest with you. Because it's two consenting adults, mutually agreed upon, with mutual respect, the skies the limit. Or, you know, if neither of you are interested then just put that on the paper. So what is it that your partner can really expect form you without this fear of rejection. This is so important. And then the last one is commitment. Are you committing to show up, to be faithful, or, and committing that one time a month we'll block off an hour and take a walk and talk about our relationship. And what will you do for the relationship? When we get in conflict, we'll ask, "What it good for the relationship?" So just take time, make your commitment list together, what you can agree on. And this is something you might wanna update from time to time. My two best friends, two of my best friends, update it every New Year's Day. They update their contact and their commitment. So this gives you a visual contract, commitment of what we're gonna do in the coming year. So take some time and do this important exercise. 

01:37:30
Loving Sexuality Please pause your VCR & try this yourselves. 

01:37:35
JON CARLSON What did you learn about yourselves as a couple as you put your lists together? Was there a lot of similarities, or were there differences? And how did you handle those? 

01:37:45
HANK I was just gonna say, it's encouraging to see the common ground we have, and it was kind of like a relief to see that we had so much common ground. Cuz when the going gets tough, tough, you wonder, you wonder where you're headed. 

01:38:00
JON CARLSON One of the things I like about this activity is you can use this, then keep that sheet of paper out there. Because it serves almost like a mission statement. It's almost like this statement about who we are, where we're going, what we're about. Yeah. 

01:38:15
PAT LOVE I actually-- go ahead. 

01:38:15
DELLA Our ideas were so different. Um, and, but it, what it made me do was think, "Wow, there's so much good stuff about our relationship." Even though they were different ideas, they were still good ideas, so, you know. 

01:38:30
JON CARLSON So you could keep both of the ideas? 

01:38:30
 Good stuff. Oh yeah. Sure, why not? 

01:38:35
JON CARLSON Yeah. Great. 

01:38:35
PAT LOVE What's so interesting is that many couples don't do this ahead of time. They made assumptions that, well, what I want you're going to want. And I really think this is at the core of problems in relationships. because why would people criticize, why would they be defensive, why would they blame? Because they're not getting their expectations met. So, stating what you want will greatly increase the probability that you're going to get it, but also, it lets your partner know, and it gives you something to work with. It gives you something to cooperate with. And so I think it's very important if you want to keep a relationship alive, and have loving sexuality, you've gotta update it. You've got to keep the energy between you. Because libido literally means life energy. That's what it means. So it's not just about physical sex. It's about the energy between you. You know, when I first started doing the research, I thought, "Well, I have to know every single sexual technique," and then I got it, wait a minute. For the most part, couples know what to do. The problem is how do you do it? How do you initiate something new. How do we change horses in midstream? Because again it's so frightening to make changes out of fear of rejection, or I'll get it wrong, or I'll find out that you haven't really liked what I've been doing for this past seven years. So it's really hard to make the changes. 

01:40:00
JON CARLSON To make new changes. 

01:40:00
PAT LOVE Yes. Yes. 

01:40:05
JON CARLSON Have you got a tip for that? 

01:40:05
PAT LOVE I do have a tip for that, and I say, there're two, there're two tips for uh, making a big change that you might have to use. And it and it is this, eat crow. Meaning that, the very thing that probably would save and ignite and energize your relationship may be the very thing that your partner suggested a year ago, two years ago, that you either ignored, or shamed him for, or blamed her for. So you might have to start off with an apology. The ver-- because see where, they say that human beings are neophobic, you know, we don't like new things. And so, uh, your partner may have made a suggestion a couple years ago that you weren't ready for. You weren't ready to go there. But you may be ready now, so you may have to say, I know you suggested this, and you've told me this before, however, and I apologize, I'm not ready then, I'm ready now. So you may have to start with an apology, because making this leap into something new. It takes energy. First of all, you have to think about it. And we all like the easy path. 

01:41:15
JON CARLSON And it probably tastes like chicken anyway, right? 

01:41:15
PAT LOVE That's right. 

01:41:20
JON CARLSON Yeah. Let's get on with it. 

01:41:20
PAT LOVE Tastes like chicken, yes. 

01:41:20
JON CARLSON Yeah. Any other reactions to merging these lists in this last act, activity? 

01:41:30
CONNIE One of the things that Hank and I recognized was that we did have a lot of the same things, but it was funny that I saw them in a different space. Um, you know, just the way he thinks is just more functional than the way I think. I'm more emotional, so that his consciousness and my compatib-- compatibility were the same, only for me, my consciousness was, was his, um, compatibility and my compatibility was his consciousness. I mean, it was just wild to see, it's just the way we think differently. 

01:42:00
PAT LOVE And that's such a good point, because I've had couples come, and and and one person says I wanna know how you feel. And he said, Well, I think we, know how you think, I wanna know how you feel. And we have to realize that we have different representational systems, that we actually learn differently. Some of us are auditory, some of us are kinesthetic, some of us are visual. If I see it, it's mine. Like I am terrible on directions, but if you give me a map, I can find my way around the world. I mean, the person who never knows which way is North, North is way I'm going, that's what North is to me, that's the way I'm headed. I've got my internal North. But if you give me a map, I can do really well, because I'm very visual. So I have to see it. So, just knowing, and that's part of consciousness, is just knowing that there's another reality over here, and that you live and see life different than I do. But to, between the two of us, like you were saying Della, it's exciting cuz there are many, many more options. 

01:43:00
JON CARLSON As I think back on this whole program that we've, we've just gone through, and, uh, learning about, uh, loving sexuality, I think the one thing that really stands out for me is, you know, I was knew differences were, uh, you know, in, uh, a big deal, but I didn't realize that they were this big of a deal in being successful in a relationship. I'm wondering what you guys might be taking away from this time together. Can you pull together maybe what you've learned, or what might stand out? 

01:43:35
HANK Well, for me, I, I like thinking about our commitment, not so much as a duty, a job, uh, a drudgery to get through, but this kind of rekindles the, the real, there was almost, uh, the way to describe it would be a delight in the earl going, and, uh, find ways to keep it alive, is really um, really a welcome idea. 

01:44:00
JON CARLSON Great. Any other learnings? Things that you're gonna be taking away? 

01:44:05
 Well, I feel that, uh, we definitely have to keep the communication, uh, open. That of course is, you know, always the key. You know, I think we're the youngest here in regards to being together, and I felt good because many things we did showed that there was a compatibility, yet I also noticed as I said, you know, before there was some thing that I thought was true and didn't, so we need to make sure that communications, uh, skills keep, uh, gaining ground and strength. 

01:44:35
JON CARLSON Keep checking in with one another. Very important. 

01:44:45
PAT LOVE Someone else. What're you taking with you? 

01:44:45
FRANK Well, for me it's like that I have, uh, a partner, an equal partner. And I, and I don't have to carry an inordinate load of responsibility, or things, I can just... 

01:45:05
PAT LOVE So this is the part of loving sexuality, adding the love to the sexuality piece, and also adding the sexuality to the love piece. And that passion can actually carry you through life for many, many, many years. And that's my wish to everybody as we close this, that you'll have many, many lives, many, many times, many, many years of passionate loving, and loving sexuality. 

01:45:35
JON CARLSON Wanna thank you for adding the Pat Love to this whole loving sexuality. Thank you very much. 

01:45:40
PAT LOVE Thank you. My pleasure.
