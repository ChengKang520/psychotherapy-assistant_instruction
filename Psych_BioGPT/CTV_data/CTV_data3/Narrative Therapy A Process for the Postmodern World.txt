A Microtraining Associates Production Narrative Therapy with Dr. John Winslade followed by reflections with with Dr. Gerald Monk 

00:00:00
DR. GERALD MONK  Hi John. 

00:00:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hi Gerald. 

00:00:25
DR. GERALD MONK Tell me, in a nutshell, what is a narrative therapy? 

00:00:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Well, it's an approach to counseling, to therapy that, uhm, takes the stories that people construct their lives out of seriously. And, and when I say seriously, it means working on the assumption that we don't actually have direct experience of our lives. We had experiences that are mediated by the stories that we build, that we live out, that we had entered into by other people, that we borrow from our cultural context. And, uhm, ah, out of those stories, we shape the things that we feel, and think and commit ourselves to, and the values that we espouse and act out and the decisions that we make. So narrative therapy is a way of saying, let's work with those stories, work with the things that shape our lives, rather than, uhm, thinking we can just, uhm, speak about them without taking account of all those cultural, ah, effects of story. 

00:01:30
DR. GERALD MONK Okay, so how do you then use those ideas in therapy? 

00:01:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Well, one of the things that I'm interested in is li, listening for people's experience, but also listening for the stories that are shaping that experience. Uhm, and, uhm, then, uhm, ah, listening as well for people's preferences the way that those, the, the way that they, their lives are being constructed. Uhm, ah, what they would like to be happening, what they would prefer to be happening, what they would choose to be happening. And if they are not, then the goal of narrative therapy is to help people separate from stories that are not working for them and to work into, or to re-author their, uhm, direction into stories that, that are more satisfying, more preferable, more in line with their, their values, their hopes and their dreams, in their own lives. 

00:02:25
DR. GERALD MONK Okay. Well, shortly, you're going to conduct an interview with Andy and... (crosstalk) 

00:02:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:02:30
DR. GERALD MONK ...ah, what can we anticipate seeing in the interview in relation to narrative practices and narrative techniques? 

00:02:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Well, in some ways there are no exactly what we're gonna be talking about, what kind of conversation it's being, it's going to be. Uhm, but what I will be seeking to do is to first of all, uhm, engage in what we might call double listening. That is, listening to, maybe a problem story that Andy wants to raise and also, at the same time, listening for, uhm, another story, uhm, that might be a story of his, uhm, you know, preferred identity, who he would like to be, what kind of things he would like to express in his life, and to hear the contrast between those things, uhm, with the view to in the end, uhm, crystallizing the choices that he might make about where to position himself. Uhm, my assumption is that people usually wanna move further away from stories that they're experiencing as problematic and move into stories of their own preference. 

00:03:30
DR. GERALD MONK  Are there particular techniques or names of, uhm, therapeutic moves that you would use in a narrative therapy session? 

00:03:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, well, I said a minute ago that one of the aims is to help people separate from the stories that they're finding to be problematic, and the practice of externalizing conversation is, of course, well-known as one of the key features of narrative practice. Uhm, it's a practice that helps people, uhm, uhm, sort of, talk about things that, that are problems for them, but in a way that, that creates a distance between themselves and their problem. And in that, in that space between, uhm, the problem and the person, uhm, there's the possibility of, of, ah, opening up, uhm, well, finding openings to new narratives. Uhm, and so we're looking, I'm looking for those openings as well, and we'll be asking questions to try and open up those new stories. 

00:04:30
DR. GERALD MONK  Okay, so you're beginning to talk about how you might conduct the session. Are there some other elements that are gonna be in your mind as you sit down with Andy and, uhm, as you're a, about to conduct the interview that you'll pay attention to? 

00:04:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Well, there's gonna be a ge, a general shape, uhm, that we're gonna do, uhm, work with and that is, first of all, that I'm gonna to interview Andy, uhm, and then I'm going to come back and interview you again, uhm, about what you've been listening to and what you've been hearing. Uhm, and one of the reasons for that is that, in a narrative practice, we are interested in how, uhm, stories get formed always in interaction with other people in the world, not just inside the individual on their own. Uhm, and so, uhm, I'm interested in how, in, in giving Andy the experience of, of overhearing how his stories influence someone else's here, in, in this case, you. And then giving him a chance to respond to what you've said and what you've heard as well. So, I will interview him, and I'll interview you, and then I'll come back and interview, uhm, Andy again. So the, that's another practice that is very common in, uhm, narrative, ah, work. 

00:05:45
DR. GERALD MONK Very good. Ah, are there any other things you'd like us to know before you begin your interview? 

00:05:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, uhm, there, ah, are various, all kinds of things that, that, ah, may come up. Uhm, I may be interested in listening for, uhm, ah, the, what we might call the absent but implicit, uhm, statements that's, uhm, that's Andy may speak about. That is, as he's speaking about things that are problematic for him, I may be listening for, at the same time, the other side of the coin, ah, which might be the, the preferred values that, that sit alongside that I'm actually, explicitly being spoken about and that we interested to he, to hear some of those and bring them forward. I'm also gonna be listening for, uhm, who are the people who stand with the story that he would prefer and those people maybe, uhm, ah, you know, people that are close to him in his life, or acquaintances, or they may even be people who are no longer alive, and who would appreciate the story of his, uhm, telling. And I'm interested sometimes in asking him questions about how that story might appear through the eyes of somebody else, not just through his own eyes, uhm, which to me, is an expression of the, the narrative emphasis on, ah, stories as being products of conflicts, than of relationships. Narrative therapy is a relational therapy. 

00:07:15
DR. GERALD MONK Okay, great, well, I'm looking forward to seeing this session. 

00:07:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Me too. 

00:07:20
DR. GERALD MONK Let's get started. 

00:07:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:07:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay, well, hello, Andy, and... (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
ANDY Hello. 

00:07:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...thank you for being willing to be part of this... (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
ANDY Welcome. 

00:07:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  uhm, this filming of, ah, of a conversation. Obviously, the, ah, filming of something does not quite equate with how it might occur in, uhm, ah, uhm, usual environment when people see, uhm, therapists. So I'm, I'm just, wanna just check with you first of all, uhm, any thoughts you have about being part of this. 

00:07:50
Acknowledging the effect of the context on the conversation 

00:07:50
ANDY  Uhm, I, I'm pretty comfortable with it. I think it's, uhm, it's an important thing. 

00:08:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
ANDY To do, ah, and, and, I'm also aware of the camera. 

00:08:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, yeah. 

00:08:05
ANDY Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:08:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And that must, in some way, affect you, and affect me as well... (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
ANDY Yeah, it, it, it does. 

00:08:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...and affects what we do. 

00:08:10
ANDY But it, it's, ah, I'm gonna do my best to just be comfortable with it and, uhm, kinda, ah, we go on with the conversation as if it wasn't there. 

00:08:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Right. 

00:08:25
ANDY But I feel, I think it is there. So it may, I'm aware that it might have a, ah, well, you know (inaudible ) conversation with me. 

00:08:32
DR. JOHN WINSLADE I would expect that, and I would also invite you, uhm, to do something in relation to that. Uhm, would it be okay with you- 

00:08:45
Inviting Andy to be a co-author in the politics of the counseling relationship 

00:08:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE - if you felt like, because of the camera being here, because of other people watching, that if I was to ask you about things or, or invite you into a piece of conversation about something you weren't comfortable with, or weren't comfortable with other people seeing, uhm, would you be able to let me know that? 

00:09:00
ANDY That's good. (crosstalk) 

00:09:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And, and, you know, 'coz I would not want to be doing this in a way that would, uhm, sort of, trap you into speaking about things that you didn't wanna do, didn't wanna speak about. Is that okay? (crosstalk) 

00:09:10
ANDY  Sure, yeah. Thank you. 

00:09:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So if we can, if, if you can find some way to indicate that, then, then I'm happy to, uhm, respect your right to choose what to include in this conversation and what not to. 

00:09:20
ANDY  I appreciate that. 

00:09:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, you, uhm, I'm imagining, you came along here with something in your mind that would be have use to you to, to speak about. Uhm, and I'm wondering if that's the starting place that we could, uhm, you could tell me a little about. 

00:09:40
ANDY  Okay. Uhm, well I think, ah, kinda throughout my life but, uhm, I've been doing a lot of thinking about it lately is I, off and on, I have, uhm, ah, issues with my confidence. 

00:10:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:10:00
ANDY Or just, ah, general life confidence and, ah, ah, relationships and, ah, and things of, of that sort and it's, it's really interesting to me 'coz sometimes I'm, I feel very confident, I feel very, ah, sure with myself but then there's times when I'm just like, ah, I feel like I'm really tough on myself and really, ah, have a hard time, uhm, just thinking that I'm, I'm good enough... (crosstalk) 

00:10:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:10:25
ANDY ...for certain things. 

00:10:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Uh hmm. 

00:10:25
ANDY So, uhm. 

00:10:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Don't, do you mind if I just ask you. 

00:10:30
ANDY Sure. (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
Asking permission gives Andy a position of some power 

00:10:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is it okay if I just take notes while I'm... (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
ANDY Absolutely. 

00:10:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...when you're speaking? Because... (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
ANDY Yeah. 

00:10:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...you said already that what you'd like to speak about, ah, what you described first of all- 

00:10:40
The 1st name for the problem story 

00:10:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE - is issues with confidence. 

00:10:40
ANDY Right. 

00:10:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  And you also spoke about there are times when confidence- 

00:10:45
The problem exists within stories of experience 

00:10:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  -Sometimes seems to disappear for you. Is that right? 

00:10:50
ANDY Yeah. 

00:10:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, and uhm, at that time, you spoke about being tough on yourself. Is that right? 

00:11:00
ANDY Yeah. 

00:11:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, uhm, and you said something else about, uhm, ah, not feeling good about yourself. Is that right? 

00:11:15
ANDY Sometimes I don't feel good enough. 

00:11:15
Stories produce feelings 

00:11:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE You don't feel good enough. Right. 

00:11:15
ANDY I don't know what that's, good enough for what? But it's, uhm, sometimes I don't see what other people see in me. 

00:11:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:11:30
ANDY Ah, you know, a lot of people say that I'm a good person and like that, but sometimes I don't get it, you know? 

00:11:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So other people see you as a good person or what else? (crosstalk) 

00:11:45
ANDY Other people see me as, as you know, ah, as, ah, intelligent and hardworking and all of these and, and sometimes I, and I think it's just me being hard on myself, but sometimes I'm just, ah, ah, I don't feel the same way all the time. 

00:12:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. Okay. So are the, you, you mentioned that this happens at some times like, you know, there are some times when it's, it happens more strongly than at other times? (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
ANDY Absolutely. 

00:12:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

00:12:10
ANDY Yeah. 

00:12:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Could you speak about, like, what are some of the times when the, uhm, the confidence seems to disappear- 

00:12:15
Use of externalizing language 

00:12:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE - when the gap between how you see yourself and how others might see you, grows larger, when, what kind of times are those? 

00:12:25
ANDY Ah, the, that's the interesting thing is that, I, I don't really know that there's any real trigger, you know? 

00:12:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is it? (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
ANDY I, I've thought about it and sometimes I just, ah, it happens like once a month or something you know, it, I just, I feel kinda low, uhm, everything seems to bother me. 

00:12:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:12:45
ANDY Uhm, and I don't really think that there's any real trigger or pressure that's causing it or anything. It's just kinda, all of a sudden, I don't feel very good and, uhm, ah. 

00:13:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So it kinda takes you by surprise and ways like that. (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
ANDY It does, yeah. 

00:13:00
The problem is referred to as "it" 

00:13:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  You can't quite identify how this happened. 

00:13:05
ANDY Right, and I try to think about it. I try to figure it out and it's like, I don't get it, but I don't feel good. 

00:13:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. So you try and figure it out. (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
ANDY Yeah. 

00:13:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Do, does that work? 

00:13:15
ANDY Uhm. 

00:13:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Does it make a difference, I mean? 

00:13:15
ANDY  I, I guess it can. Ah, I, I, I don't know if it makes a huge difference. It, uhm, it's one of those things I, over time, I just kinda learned to deal with it- 

00:13:30
The 1st piece of the counter-story 

00:13:30
ANDY and just say... (crosstalk) 

00:13:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:13:30
ANDY ...to myself, well, I guess this is, this is it and you know, and then I, I'll ah, wake up a few days later, I will, I'll feel good again. So... (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. Okay. 

00:13:40
ANDY ...ah, or I'll, I'll make, I'll do certain things maybe to, ah, to kinda try to make myself feel better but, sometimes, I'm just not, ah, motivated to do those things either, so. 

00:13:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. So there are times when you've learned to deal with it and you do things to make yourself feel better and I, I wanna come back to those in a minute. But I just wanna get a- 

00:14:00
Too early to explore the counter story still 

00:14:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE slightly more full understanding of what, uhm, actually happens at this time when this low feeling starts to take you over. 

00:14:10
ANDY Uh hmm. 

00:14:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Uhm, could you, could you, kind of, think of a time when this happened and, kind of, sort of talk me through it, and help me understand what happens? 

00:14:25
ANDY (sighs) Uhm, well, I'm, I'm training, I'm in school to be a therapist. 

00:14:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:14:30
ANDY And, uhm, uhm, I, I have a lot of feedback from people telling me that, you know, this is the right place for me to be and that... (crosstalk) 

00:14:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:14:40
ANDY ...that I'm, uhm, I would be good in this and then I, you know, I'm really helpful and all that. And a lot of times I believe that, you know, a lot of times... (crosstalk) 

00:14:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:14:50
ANDY ...I, I, I feel pretty good about where I'm at uhm, but there are times, even though I'm, I'm doing really well in school and even though I get that feedback, there are times when I, I just don't really believe it in myself. 

00:15:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:15:05
ANDY I don't, I don't believe that, uhm, or, or it's ha, I don't know 'coz I don't believe it. It's that it's hard for me to always feel like this is the right place for me to be. 

00:15:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:15:20
ANDY And, or feel that I'm even doing any good for anybody and ah. 

00:15:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, is it like, at these times, you know, that the idea that this is the right place for me to be and other people believe that and I can sometimes even believe it myself, but it sort of flies out the window and other thoughts come in at that time. 

00:15:40
ANDY  Yeah. 

00:15:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Are you, are you thinking of a particular time as you say this? I mean, you. (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
ANDY Uhm, I, I mean, well, well, last semester was, was really difficult and I had some, ah, personal issues going on as well. 

00:15:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:15:55
ANDY Uhm, but I, I did a lot of, kind of, soul searching and trying to figure out is this where I wanna be. Uhm, again, I did very well in school but it, to me, it's not about academics, it's about is this the right path that I wanna take? 

00:16:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
ANDY And, uhm, I wasn't, there were ti, I, I don't know if I can give you a specific example but. (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:16:15
ANDY Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE But it was last semester especially. 

00:16:15
ANDY Last semester was, was very difficult. 

00:16:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE It was last semester when this question became stronger for you or. 

00:16:20
ANDY  Uhm, I, I think so. 

00:16:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:16:25
ANDY I think so and I, I, I'm trying to, uhm, just come to terms with, with this idea that I don't know what the future holds for me. 

00:16:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:16:40
ANDY And if I'm comfortable with, uhm, where I'm at in this moment, I mean, I, I have a very difficult time living in the moment. 

00:16:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:16:45
ANDY  And uhm, it's something I'm, I'm trying to do. My brain kinda, takes me in places that I'd start thinking about the future, I start thinking, I, I'll be in a very positive state of mind and then all of a sudden some negative thoughts come in and I don't really know where they come from but uhm. 

00:17:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So it's like... (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
ANDY And I. 

00:17:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...there's a voice that, that- 

00:17:10
The problem is externalized as a voice that speaks to Andy 

00:17:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE - kind of speaks to you every now and then. 

00:17:10
ANDY Yeah. 

00:17:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And, and interferes with any of your more hopeful thoughts about your future and where you might be and it kind of raises all these uncomfortable questions about, you know, am I doing the right thing? Am I gonna be any good at this? Is it, is it gonna be worthwhile? Ah, am I right? Is that, is that close or. (crosstalk). 

00:17:30
ANDY Yup, that's very close. 

00:17:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. So what is this voice saying? Like what, if we could kinda characterize it, what, like what kind of questions does it ask? 

00:17:35
ANDY  Uhm, I, I think it, it, ah, you know, just says, uhm, are you gonna be helping these people? Or, uhm, is this really where you wanna be? And, uhm, I, I think it just raises a lot of doubts, you know, ah, uhm, about my future and uhm. 

00:18:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So doubts- 

00:18:05
"Doubts" is another externalized name for the problem 

00:18:05
ANDY  Yeah. 

00:18:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Doubts interfere, right? 

00:18:10
ANDY Yeah. 

00:18:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Like doubts about your future, about anything else? 

00:18:10
ANDY  Uhm, I, I, I guess it's doubts about who I am, you know? 

00:18:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:18:20
ANDY Sometimes I'm not sure I'm as good a person as everyone says I am, you know? And I'm, I'm trying to, to also give myself a little bit of credit and a little bit of, uhm, ah, space to not always be that good person. 

00:18:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:18:40
ANDY I, I, I don't, I don't think it's possible to be, for me anyway, ah, 100 percent of the time, a good person, and I'm trying to cut myself a break, ah, you know? 

00:18:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, it's like this voice of, of the doubts says you know, you know, where you're going, you know, what kind of future is this? Who are you? 

00:19:00
ANDY Uh hmm. 

00:19:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  You know, what kind of person are you? Do you think you're some kinda good person? 

00:19:05
ANDY Right. 

00:19:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And then, you also try to give yourself some credit, you know, like, hang on a second, I am more of a good person and that or I am. This is something that's worthwhile. This is something that I wanna do. So this, kinda, both of those things going on? 

00:19:20
ANDY Yeah. 

00:19:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

00:19:20
ANDY Yeah. 

00:19:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Can I ask, uhm, the, the voice of those doubts, does it have a history for you? 

00:19:30
Exploring the history of the problem story 

00:19:30
ANDY Absolutely. Absolutely. (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Tell me about the history of that voice, of those doubts. 

00:19:35
ANDY Uhm, I mean, as long as I can remember the, there's been some, there's been, those voices there, you know, those thoughts that are, I mean, telling me that I'm not, ah, good enough. 

00:19:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
ANDY That I'm not popular enough or. 

00:19:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. 

00:19:55
ANDY Ah, it was definitely in, in grade school, I didn't feel very liked. I didn't feel very popular or uhm. 

00:20:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
ANDY When I was in, in crowd and, uhm, I felt like I was doing, I was always being a nice person to people but they, ah, kids can be really mean. (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:20:15
ANDY You know? And I, I was, uhm, I was kind of a scapegoat for all that, those mean comments and actions and... (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Really? 

00:20:20
ANDY ...things like that as a kid. 

00:20:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:20:25
ANDY And I think that, uhm, as I got older, you know, I, I, I would, it wasn't until really college that I started feeling like more confident in myself and, and it started in a kind of a journey, you know? 

00:20:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:20:40
ANDY Ah, uhm, I, I feel a lot more confident in myself today than I ever did. 

00:20:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:20:45
ANDY But, uhm, it's still a kind of ah, a struggle sometimes and, uhm, I do remember, you know, the, ah, the hard times of, of the kids and things like that. It kinda, it's hard for me to let it go. 

00:21:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:21:00
ANDY Completely. 

00:21:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:21:00
ANDY I want to, you know, I wanted to say that was the past but it was, it was difficult, you know, grade school and high school and things like that. 

00:21:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So as you think back on that- 

00:21:10
Acknowledging the effect of power relations on Andy 

00:21:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE - like there are times when you were, ah, uhm, it sounds like treated meanly and badly by other kids and these things had an effect on you, right? (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
ANDY Absolutely. 

00:21:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, and it wasn't until some years later that you could actually, uhm, in some way, uhm, escape those effects but, but, it sounds like that was quite a hard time of your life, is it right? 

00:21:35
ANDY It was pretty difficult, yeah. 

00:21:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Hmm. So. (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
ANDY It kinda made me feel like I wasn't good enough. 

00:21:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:21:40
ANDY You know, I think that's when those thoughts started coming in. My parents... (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:21:45
ANDY ...were great. 

00:21:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
ANDY You know, they al, always try to tell me I was great in, in stuff but it's different coming from your parents and those from your peers, you know? (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm, uh hmm. 

00:21:55
ANDY I'm kinda wanted my peers' approval more than I do with my parents, so. 

00:21:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm, hmm. 

00:21:55
ANDY  I didn't feel like I fit in a lot of times. 

00:22:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So the, those kind of experiences of being, uhm, scapegoated- 

00:22:05
Mapping the internalized effects of being subject to power relations 

00:22:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE - treated meanly, uhm, like rejected or I'm not sure if that's the right word but... (crosstalk) 

00:22:10
ANDY Yeah, definitely. 

00:22:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  And, uhm, had an effect on you, like somehow you internalized those and felt like somehow it was your fault. Am I right? Is that, is that what it felt? Or... (crosstalk) 

00:22:25
ANDY Uhm, I don't know if I ever felt like it was my fault. Ah, maybe there were times I did. 

00:22:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE At times, okay. 

00:22:30
ANDY Uhm, but, ah, I just didn't feel like I fit in. 

00:22:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. 

00:22:35
ANDY You know, it's, I tried to play football, uhm, I love football but I, it wasn't, I'm not a jock. 

00:22:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:22:40
ANDY I never really was. I always trying to find my place and I couldn't really, I didn't feel like I was finding my place. And I think a lot of times I was trying to be, uhm, trying to be friends with people who I wasn't really gonna be friends with and, well, you know, I had this idea back then that I wanted to be popular and so I want to hang out with the popular kids, and I was kinda missing out on the friends that I actually did like. 

00:23:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:23:05
ANDY 'Coz I was always wanting something else. 

00:23:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:23:05
ANDY And I wasn't, you know, being appreciative of what I had, at least, you know? Uhm. 

00:23:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So what was it do you think that drove you- 

00:23:15
Deconstructing the dominant discourse 

00:23:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE - to want those, the approval or the friendship, of the people who you call the popular ones, the jocks and so on? (crosstalk) 

00:23:25
ANDY I don't know, uhm. 

00:23:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE What, what, kind of produced that feeling? 

00:23:30
ANDY Being happy with who I am, being okay with who I am and... (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:23:35
ANDY ...uhm, if I'm okay with who I am, then I'm gonna, kinda, find the niche that I'm, ah, supposed to be in and... (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
ANDY  You know, and be ha, happy with the friends that I have. 

00:23:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:23:45
ANDY I have some really great friends. 

00:23:45
A unique outcome of an exception to the problem story 

00:23:45
ANDY  And I feel badly that I was unable to appreciate that a lot of times. 

00:23:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. "I have some really great friends." Ah, I'm just making a note of that 'coz it sounds important in relation to this issue that you're talking about, right? 

00:24:00
ANDY Definitely. Hhmm. 

00:24:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  And before we come back to that again though, uhm, can I ask you, uhm, you, you have spoken about this confidence issue and the doubts and the experiences you had that produced those. And uhm, the history of them, uhm, down through the college, affecting relationships... (crosstalk) 

00:24:25
ANDY Uh hmm. 

00:24:25
Mapping the effects of the problem 

00:24:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Affecting you in some ways and jobs as well. I think you say that though you didn't explain about that. I'm just trying. (crosstalk) 

00:24:30
ANDY Yeah, and, you know, the jobs, ah, I mean, I think they might have a little bit of effect but I was, by the time I was uhm, I mean, after college in, in, in the workforce, I was feeling, at least that I'm part of it. I was feeling that I was, uhm, pretty well desired to be, to be working, uhm, if I would, I would say, uhm, was, I was, I'm a pretty good employee. 

00:25:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:25:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And, uhm, so I, I don't think the lack of confidence really had a, ah, an effect there. I was, I was starting to be, starting to realize- 

00:25:10
Another unique outcome 

00:25:10
ANDY - that I was being seen as a leader. 

00:25:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:25:10
ANDY And, uhm, and that was interesting to me. And that people would kinda look for me, look to me for guidance in, in the workforce, you know, and not just on general ideas or whatever that I was, uhm, that was interesting 'coz I was like, I never saw myself as that. 

00:25:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:25:30
ANDY You know, I never saw myself as someone who could be a leader. I always felt like I was following too much and, uhm, and I think that was pretty important for me to realize that, you know, people do, I was trying to see that people really did see some good qualities in me. 

00:25:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
ANDY And uhm. 

00:25:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, it sounds like you're saying that, uhm, these doubts which affected you more in the area of friendships and personal relationships where you, you were able to prevent them- 

00:26:05
Acknowledging agency against the problem 

00:26:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE - from being, ah, undermining of you in that working area to the extent that people could see you as a leader and you could now say in your action that's something that interesting. I haven't really thought of it that way, but you are able to somehow embrace that idea of yourself and in the work context, and able to say I wa, I'm a pretty good employee. 

00:26:20
ANDY Yeah, and I think at the same time, however I, I think that now that I'm thinking about it, there was issues in my confidence because I, I even though I was being seen as a leader, uhm, I don't think I was leading as well as I could. 

00:26:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:26:40
ANDY Uhm, because I didn't feel as strong as I wanted to or I didn't feel like I had the right really to be that leader... (crosstalk) 

00:26:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:26:50
ANDY ...or to be, to, uhm, to kinda tell people what they do or whatever. 

00:26:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, when the thoughts of being a good employee and a leader were there, there was still this voice of doubt coming in... (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
ANDY Right. 

00:27:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...and undermining you. 

00:27:05
ANDY Yeah. 

00:27:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And saying, you know, "Who are you to have the right to do this?" 

00:27:10
ANDY Yeah. 

00:27:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Right? Are there any other ways in which this whole issue- 

00:27:15
Returning to map the current effects of the problem. 

00:27:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE - has affected you like, you know, even right now, in a, in a, right in your life right now? 

00:27:20
ANDY  Uhm, I mean, I think as far as, ah, relationships go I, I, uhm, I don't know, I mean, I, I don't, I, I guess it's, it's, it's affecting me a little bit. 

00:27:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:27:45
ANDY  Uhm, it's more of the uncertainty of things. 

00:27:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:27:50
ANDY Uhm, not necessarily the, the lack of confidence but just the uncertainty of where things are gonna go, uhm, that kinda brings about that voice of doubt again. 

00:28:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:28:05
ANDY You know, uhm.(crosstalk) 

00:28:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So when things get uncertain or you're not sure where things are gonna go, then the voice of doubt comes charging back in at that moment, is that right? 

00:28:15
ANDY Definitely. 

00:28:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, and says, you know, "What right have you got?" You know, "You're not good enough." (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
ANDY Yeah, I, (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE All that kind of stuff. 

00:28:20
ANDY I just wanna, ah, I feel like I wanna be sure but that's a, just an unrealistic goal, you know? (crosstalk) 

00:28:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:28:25
ANDY I don't know what the future's gonna hold and I, I, I need to, I'm trying to learn that, you know, and kinda be okay with, with the fact that there may never be a time right now, you know? 

00:28:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. And you spoke about that in relation to the last semester in your study and the stuff like that. And you know, becoming a therapist, but you're also saying that in, if I hear you right, in terms of relationships as well right now, is that affecting you there? (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
ANDY I, I, I think a little bit, not so much. 

00:28:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Not so much? 

00:28:50
ANDY  Uhm, I'm in a relationship right now that I feel pretty good about. 

00:28:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:28:55
ANDY  And so, well I, I definitely have doubts, you know? As of today I feel pretty good about it. Ah, as of two days ago, ah, it would have been a different story, you know? 

00:29:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:29:10
ANDY And it's kinda the back and forth that I go through a lot. 

00:29:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. If I was ask you to, sort of, assess this, this doubt feeling and the, the voice of doubt, uhm, and how big an effect it's having on you, what would you say? Like, you know, ho, how, how powerful is this and its undermining force for you? 

00:29:35
ANDY (sigh) It, it's somewhat powerful, but I, uhm, I, I feel like I've done a lot of thinking and a lot of, uhm, ah, work on kinda undermining that, its effects, uhm, already... (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:30:00
ANDY ...but it's, it's still there and I don't like it, you know? I think it's, it's still there, uhm, ah, it's hard for me to tell you like, like how powerful it is right now. 

00:30:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:30:15
ANDY I can tell you that it's nowhere near as powerful as it used to be. 

00:30:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay, ah, and when you say that, what, what time of your life are you thinking of? 

00:30:20
ANDY Ah, like, I'm thinking, uhm, probably thinking just, you know, five years ago, uhm, uhm, ah, yeah, I, I mean, that most of my life is that way. 

00:30:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:30:35
ANDY But after college it was better. It's still there, uhm. 

00:30:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  So, is there anything about five years ago that? 

00:30:45
ANDY No, not right, ah, five years is just a number. (crosstalk) 

00:30:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Just a number? 

00:30:50
ANDY Yeah, I, I, I mean, it, it could have pro, probably been worse a year ago, you know? (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Uh hmm. 

00:30:55
ANDY Uhm, prior to school, I think I might have been feeling. 

00:30:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, whether it's in the last five years or in the last year, you've done some things that sounds like- 

00:31:00
Ascribing change to Andy's agency 

00:31:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  to, uhm, undermine the power of these doubts. (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
ANDY Uh hmm. 

00:31:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, you described, I've done a lot of thinking and. 

00:31:15
ANDY Thinking is a double-edged sword for me. 

00:31:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is it? 

00:31:15
ANDY I'm, I'm a huge thinker and it can be a very big problem. I overthink things a lot but it can also be a really a good tool that I have. 

00:31:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, thinking can bring back the doubts. 

00:31:25
ANDY Yes. 

00:31:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  But it can also be a good tool? 

00:31:30
ANDY Absolutely. 

00:31:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  So, when it's a good tool- 

00:31:35
Separating out the counter-story and inquiring into it. 

00:31:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE - what do you do? 

00:31:35
ANDY Uhm, I, I think I just remind myself of, of good things and, uhm, remind myself to kind of look at positive things in life rather than focusing on negative all the time. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:31:50
ANDY I'm a waiter right now and it's very easy to be caught up in the negativity of others. (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:31:55
ANDY  and, uhm, it's a very stressful job and I'm, uhm, finding it difficult to, uhm, ah, to enjoy being there and, and, ah, appreciate the fact that the, the fact that I have a job and I'm getting money. Uhm, because it's just really difficult working with people in that context, a very different context than working as a therapist. 

00:32:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:32:20
ANDY  Uhm, which is equally difficult but... (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:32:25
ANDY ...Uhm. 

00:32:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, being caught up in the negative, negativity of others. 

00:32:30
ANDY Yeah, I'm affected by others a lot. 

00:32:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:32:30
ANDY So. 

00:32:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Are you saying that you would, you don't like that? 

00:32:35
Inviting Andy to judge the problem story 

00:32:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE You don't like being caught up in the negativity of the events? 

00:32:40
ANDY I don't, yeah. 

00:32:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, what, tell me about why not, like what is it that you would- 

00:32:45
Inviting the preferred story 

00:32:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE - prefer that's different from that? 

00:32:45
ANDY  I just, I, I wanna approach situations, uhm, where I can just find the positive and just think about the positive things rather than being caught up in all the, the crap that's going on and, you know, for instance I, I wa, I walk into work for the first time in a couple of weeks, on Friday. And the first comment that one of my, uhm, co-workers made was a negative comment about the, the, the customers. 

00:33:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:33:15
ANDY  And it's like, God, it's like right away, you know, there's negativity, right away there's, you, you're starting off with, uhm, ah, a negative attitude... (crosstalk) 

00:33:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:33:30
ANDY ...you know? And I just, ah, I'm, I wanna say to myself and I do say to myself that whatever, you know, I'm gonna get bad tips, I'm gonna, you know, it's gonna be difficult working, you're gonna get cre, rude people. (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:33:40
ANDY  But, you know, I just wanna try to. (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, did you say that to yourself on that day? 

00:33:45
Detailing the moment of exception 

00:33:45
ANDY Yeah, yeah, I had a really. (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  You got a negative comment as soon as you came in. You got the crap there, right at the start. (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
ANDY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:33:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  And, and you said, "Whatever." 

00:33:55
ANDY I, I just said, you know, it's, forget it and... (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:34:00
ANDY ...I went off and did my job and I, and, uhm, it was a pretty good day, you know? I, I'm just... (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:34:05
ANDY ...there were some, some negativity and, uhm, getting caught up in the rudeness of people but I, I, it, at, the thing with, with the restaurant business is at the end of the night, I still make decent money. So, it's not about, uhm, what happens in between but it's the end product, the end product... (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:34:30
ANDY ...is, is you know, it's a pretty decent job. 

00:34:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:34:30
ANDY You know, and that's what I wanna keep in mind and not get caught up in all the, the negativity and the, the stuff that just makes it hard, you know? 

00:34:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  So, it sounds like you remind yourself of that, and actually, this is a decent job. 

00:34:45
ANDY Yeah. 

00:34:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE There is all this, uhm, ah, negative talk that comes around, uhm, and you could get caught up in it but you remind yourself, "No, I don't need to do that." Is that right? 

00:35:00
ANDY Yeah. 

00:35:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE How did you learn to do that? 

00:35:00
Asking for the history of the counter-story 

00:35:00
ANDY Ah, I don't know. I, ah, there, I, I do remember there was one, uhm, instance in college that I remind myself about that... (crosstalk) 

00:35:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:35:10
ANDY ...uhm, I just, there was, uhm, ah, one day, I was hanging out with some friends then all of a sudden I just felt this kind of wave. I, I'd say depression but I don't know what it was, but I just felt really sad all of a sudden. (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:35:25
ANDY And I had to leave the room and I, uhm, and after that day I was just, I'm like, I'm saying to myself I don't wanna be like this. 

00:35:30
Resistance to the power of the problem 

00:35:30
ANDY I don't wanna feel. (crosstalk) 

00:35:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Said about what? 

00:35:35
ANDY I don't know. I have no idea. (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE You didn't know? 

00:35:35
ANDY I, I just didn't feel good. 

00:35:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:35:40
ANDY I just all of a sudden felt really weird and kinda bad and, and after that I said to myself, I don't wanna feel like this and, and so I, I, I made an effort to, uhm, any bad situation, to try to find positive in it. (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:35:55
ANDY  And I started singing a song to myself about a... (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:36:00
ANDY ...it's a Monty Python song, it says always look on the bright side of life. 

00:36:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. (laughs) 

00:36:05
ANDY I just kinda started singing that to my. (crosstalk) 

00:36:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Amazing. 

00:36:05
ANDY  Yeah, it's a great song and, ah, uhm, so anytime I was feeling bad about something, I would just start singing that, and I would try to find the good qualities of things, the positive in, in life and ah. 

00:36:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And not get caught up in the negativity? 

00:36:20
ANDY Not get caught up in the negativity. (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Hmm. 

00:36:25
ANDY I mean, I probably learned it- 

00:36:25
A story of difference 

00:36:25
ANDY - from somewhere but I, it's, it's, it would, and then ah, this is where my thinking becomes a good tool is... (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:36:30
ANDY ...you know, I was, I, I just kinda, was able to do it for myself, you know? Uhm, I just tell myself to, to, to kind of, to be more positive and... (crosstalk) 

00:36:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:36:40
ANDY  uhm, and that's what I'm trying to do again, you know? Just trying to. 

00:36:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, when you do that, can I ask what difference it makes? 

00:36:50
Inviting meaning-making of the story of difference 

00:36:50
ANDY Makes a huge difference. (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:36:50
ANDY  Uhm, I, you know, I just start to see, to notice positive things, you know, not be wrapped up in the negativity of, of life. Life is, can be pretty negative. There's a lot of, there's a lot of bad things out there. 

00:37:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:37:10
ANDY And I have a tendency to get overwhelmed by that, and to get kind of wrapped up in, in all the, you know, hatred and negativity that's out there. 

00:37:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:37:20
ANDY And I miss the beauty... (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:37:25
ANDY ...you know? And I, I don't wanna miss that. I wanna, ah, life, ah, to me, I'm, I'm very intrigued by this balance thing. Yes, there is negative, negativity out there but there's a huge amount of beauty and positive, positivity, ah, too. (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:37:40
ANDY And I'm trying to, to recognize that more and take time out. (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE The, is there a connection between the negativity and the feelings of depth? 

00:37:45
Connecting the dots of the problem story 

00:37:45
ANDY  Uhm, probably. I, I, I, I've. (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE We, we're talking about two different things. I'm wondering if they're connected or something. 

00:37:55
ANDY I, I think they are. I think that, uhm, the feelings of doubt have kinda, uhm, allowed me or, ah, or push me toward seeing things negative in light, in a negative light. 

00:38:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:38:05
ANDY Uhm, so they're probably related. 

00:38:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And they feed on negativity? 

00:38:10
ANDY Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:38:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE It was. (crosstalk) 

00:38:10
ANDY I think they probably feed on each other, you know? 

00:38:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  They feed on each other? 

00:38:15
ANDY Yeah. 

00:38:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay, hmm. And what they rob you off is the sense of beauty in life, right? 

00:38:20
ANDY Yeah. 

00:38:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  So, uhm, I'm interested in this, what you're describing which is being able to notice the positive things, being able to see beauty in life. Uhm, you know, ah, I'm interested in how you, how that works for you, like, uhm, that you're saying somehow, you can do some thinking that enables that to happen. But I'm interested in how it actually changes things for you, 'coz you're describing how it, it makes quite a difference when you use that thinking as a tool of this(ph), it makes quite a difference to your sense of yourself and your, you know, who you are in that moment, and if I'm not wrong, is that right? I mean. (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
ANDY Yeah, that's right. 

00:39:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, how does it work? 

00:39:15
ANDY Uhm, I don't know. Uhm, I think I'm just, ah, ah, I, I don't know, I just try to, I, I try to just tell myself to, ah, be more positive and I try to keep reminding myself in repetition and... (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:39:40
ANDY ...uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. Do repetition is positive? 

00:39:40
ANDY Yeah, I think so. The, there's, there are things that I can, that I like to do, that I have fun with but I find that, uhm, I'm not doing enough of them. Uhm, I, it's, this is all kind of, there's the thinking definitely... (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:40:00
ANDY ...but there's, there's other things that I, that make me feel good that I'm not really doing. 

00:40:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:40:05
ANDY And, uhm. 

00:40:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, I'm interested in what you mean by that? 

00:40:10
ANDY Well, like exercise... (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:40:10
ANDY ...you know, playing sports and, uhm, the, the problem, it, it's difficult at this point in my life to be able to do all the things that I want because of money and time and, and things like that. So, uhm. 

00:40:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. So there are limits to what you can do? 

00:40:30
ANDY Yeah. 

00:40:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And, but you have ideas about what can, it sounds like, ah, what can grow... (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
ANDY Uh hmm. 

00:40:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  and the sense of feeling positive about yourself, uhm, appreciating the beauty of life and, and feeling good and feeling worth, more worthwhile, right? 

00:40:50
ANDY Uh hmm. 

00:40:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And exercise is kinda connected with this in some way? 

00:40:50
ANDY Yeah. 

00:40:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Or following through on your... (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
ANDY Yeah. 

00:40:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...interest and value in doing some of those things? 

00:41:00
ANDY I think following through is, is huge. 

00:41:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is it? 

00:41:00
ANDY I, uhm, a lot of times I don't follow through- 

00:41:05
Preferred stories often get stalled in intentions that are not actualized 

00:41:05
ANDY - the things. I don't feel really good about it. 

00:41:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:41:05
ANDY And, ah, uhm, and so, I think grad school is, it's pretty important to me because, uhm. 

00:41:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE That's something we, you do have to follow through, right? 

00:41:20
ANDY Definitely. 

00:41:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:41:20
ANDY Definitely. And I, and I, I feel like I'm doing very well in, in school. And it's different because in college, I did okay but I wasn't, uhm, ah, overly interested in the academic part of that process, you know? 

00:41:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, you're doing something that you have more interest in there? 

00:41:40
ANDY Yeah. Definitely, definitely. And I, and I, and I think that, you know, because I'm interested in this field and because I, you know, I'm at a point right now in my life where, uhm, uhm, I'm more responsible or... (crosstalk) 

00:41:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:41:55
ANDY ...you know, I'm trying to figure out what it is I wanna do. I'm, I'm taking more interest in this. And so, I'm doing very well but, uhm, whereas at college it was, I was more interested in social ideas and, uhm, kinda growing in that way, and, and socially, rather than academically. Uhm. 

00:42:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE I, if, I'm understanding that it sounds like that you're, uhm, doing something now that somehow captures who you are and who you wanna be in a full way that, that you're finding more compelling. I mean is that fair enough or? 

00:42:30
ANDY Ah, ah, yeah. It's always fair enough, and I, I, I think that's the, the dilemma that I'm having is that, I think this is where I belong yet, I still have doubts. 

00:42:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:42:40
ANDY And I, uhm, I don't wanna have those doubts, you know? But I, ah, again, I guess that's where I have to give myself a little bit of a break- 

00:42:50
Unique outcome 

00:42:50
ANDY - because I think the doubts are gonna be there. I don't know what the future holds for me. I don't know, uhm, uhm, my mission or whatever. 

00:42:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Yeah. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:43:00
ANDY And, uhm, so. (crosstalk) 

00:43:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, (crosstalk) 

00:43:00
ANDY I don't know what the future holds. (crosstalk) 

00:43:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE so when you say, "I think this is where I belong," tell me about that sense of belonging. And what about- 

00:43:05
Curiosity to grow the counter-story 

00:43:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE - to understand that a bit more. Like, what is it about the therapy work that you're stepping into as you are doing your study that kind of fits with who you are in, in a way that you're finding, you know, this is where I belong. 

00:43:20
ANDY I feel good when I help people. 

00:43:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Really? 

00:43:25
ANDY I, I, I feel good and I feel good, uhm, when I can make a difference and, uhm, I feel good when people come to me, uhm, with, with some issue and, are seeking help from me... (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:43:40
ANDY ...that feels good to me. (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:43:40
ANDY Uhm, and. (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE What does that do? What, how does like, how does that make you feel good? 

00:43:45
ANDY Uhm, I just, I feel like I accomplished something. 

00:43:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:43:50
ANDY  I feel like people value me. 

00:43:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Uh hmm. 

00:44:00
ANDY Feel valued, I think, and uhm. 

00:44:05
[sil.] 

00:44:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  So, when other people value you, it makes a difference? 

00:44:10
Establishing an audience to the counter-story 

00:44:10
ANDY Definitely. 

00:44:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. So, you know, I'm wondering if, if we could imagine, uhm, just for a moment, uhm, whether there'd be other people who would say, uhm, this is where Andy belongs. Who would you think of? 

00:44:30
ANDY A lot. 

00:44:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE A lot of people? Like who, for example? (crosstalk) 

00:44:30
ANDY Uhm, well, I've heard it from my professors now and... (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:44:35
ANDY ...I've heard it from my parents and I heard it from, uhm, ah, various friends and, and things like that, uhm. 

00:44:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:44:45
ANDY  I think part of the problem is that I've never really done anything else, you know? I've always been in this field, social services and, (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:45:00
ANDY and maybe that's where some of the doubts come in. It's like, I mean, is there something else, but I don't, I don't really have any desire to do anything else. Uhm. 

00:45:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. So, when we started... (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
ANDY I don't know. 

00:45:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...speaking about, you know, who are the people who believe in and value you and, uhm, would, would, uhm, re, understand the sense of accomplishment that you have and, uhm, see you as fitting very strongly here, immediately that voice of doubt comes... (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
ANDY Yeah. 

00:45:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...charging back in again, and says, "Well, hang on a second, you haven't done anything else. How would you really know?" 

00:45:30
ANDY Yeah. 

00:45:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? I mean, (crosstalk) 

00:45:30
ANDY Yeah. 

00:45:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ah, so, it starts to undermine you immediately, right? 

00:45:35
ANDY Yeah, it does. 

00:45:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And you're, sort of, smiling as you say that. What, what, what are you thinking? 

00:45:40
ANDY Ah, ah, ah, you're right. I mean, it, it's just so strange, you know? (crosstalk) 

00:45:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is it? 

00:45:45
ANDY It feels strange to me. It's like, you know, I'll be in this good place and then all of a sudden it's like something inside me is, is trying to bring me back down, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Yeah. 

00:45:55
ANDY The, yeah, like, there's, there's thoughts that- 

00:46:00
Andy is now using externalizing language himself. 

00:46:00
ANDY - all of a sudden, are being negative. And it's like, (crosstalk) 

00:46:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:46:00
ANDY what's that about? (crosstalk) 

00:46:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Uh hmm. 

00:46:00
ANDY  And I know, and it, it's strange, like, I can, I can, I, I have this conversation with myself. It's like, where are these (inaudible ) thought, why are you thinking this way? 

00:46:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:46:10
ANDY Stop it. You know, like, I want it to just stop. 

00:46:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE You really object to these negative thoughts. (crosstalk) 

00:46:15
ANDY Yeah. I, (crosstalk) 

00:46:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Right? 

00:46:15
ANDY I don't get it. 

00:46:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:46:15
ANDY I don't know why they could, they just creep in there, and it's like, "Stop!" 

00:46:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yup. 

00:46:20
ANDY You know? Ah, just stop being so being negative on yourself and just try to enjoy your life and enjoy where you're at and, uhm, be good with, ah, be okay with who you are, but it's like, these thoughts just creep in there, (crosstalk) 

00:46:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:46:30
ANDY out of nowhere, it seems like, (crosstalk) 

00:46:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm, hmm. 

00:46:30
ANDY  you know. 

00:46:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, I'm wondering whose voice should you call on to answer- 

00:46:35
Inviting the incorporation of others' voices in Andy's identity 

00:46:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  -back to those negative thoughts? 

00:46:40
ANDY Ah, it only comes from me, again. (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Really? 

00:46:40
ANDY This, I, I don't, I mean, I'm, I'm very, ah, I love that people, other people, think that I'm doing the job and, you know, I like the feedback, but I don't, uhm, until I can believe it on myself. 

00:46:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. 

00:47:00
ANDY It doesn't really matter what other people are saying. 

00:47:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, you know, your professors, your parents, your friends, can believe this about you, but somehow you have to take it onboard a bit more for yourself. 

00:47:10
ANDY Right. 

00:47:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Right. Uhm. Can I ask though, of all the people that you've thought of here, uhm, people who, in your life at present or people who are no longer alive, who would be the person who would believe in you the most and believe that you would have this ability to offer something really worthwhile and be able to do something that would be, something you could feel good about and would be a place that would indicate that this is the place where you belong and you make a difference in the world? Who, who would you think of? 

00:47:50
ANDY My father. 

00:47:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Your father? 

00:47:55
ANDY Uh hmm. 

00:47:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE What would he say about you? 

00:47:55
ANDY I mean all of those things. 

00:47:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE All of those things? 

00:47:55
ANDY Yeah. 

00:47:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Really? 

00:48:00
ANDY Uh hmm. I mean, (crosstalk) 

00:48:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE He's. 

00:48:00
ANDY you know, ah, he's always, uhm, encouraging me and, ah, you know, telling me. We, we have lots of really good conversations and, and ah, (crosstalk) 

00:48:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Do you? 

00:48:15
ANDY  talk about it a lot, so, uhm, yeah, he's, he's always been encouraging me along the way, yeah, reminding me of, of good things and, and things like that. So, uhm, yeah. 

00:48:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And when the negative thoughts would threaten to rob you of confidence- 

00:48:40
Subjunctive question 

00:48:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  -and, what would he say? 

00:48:45
ANDY Uhm. 

00:48:50
[sil.] 

00:48:50
ANDY  I, I, I don't know what he would say. (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
ANDY I, I can't, I don't know. But I, I know, I do know that we have had conversations. I've called him before and, you know, when I'm not feeling great and, and talk to him and, you know, and we'll talk about life, and, and, and, whatever. And that can, ah, uhm, but, well, no, it, and so it like, he'll say, he'll encourage me and, you know, and like that but, uhm. 

00:49:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Do those conversations make a difference? 

00:49:25
ANDY I, I think, I think they do, over time. (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:49:30
ANDY But in a moment, it's, it's more, I just got to kinda deal with it. It, like, and what happens is, I, uhm, I can recall the conversations and, and thoughts later on... (crosstalk) 

00:49:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:49:40
ANDY ...uhm, or, you know, encouragement from people later on but, uhm, it just takes a little bit of time. (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:49:45
ANDY It's, it's got to, you know, ah. 

00:49:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  So, you have to, it has to go through a process inside you to get to the point where you can make use of it. 

00:49:55
ANDY Right. 

00:49:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, like that comment from the friend who, 

00:50:00
ANDY Yeah. 

00:50:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...who spoke to you in college, right? (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
ANDY Uh hmm. 

00:50:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. Hmm. (sighs) 

00:50:05
[sil.] 

00:50:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  I'm wondering, uhm, what, what you would call, uhm, this, uhm, these other ways of thinking- 

00:50:20
Naming the counter-story 

00:50:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  -that somehow you can access, given a bit of time and maybe in your relationship with your dad, somehow you're conscious of that and maybe some other places as well when you do that thinking. What would you call all of that if were to, sort of, name it? 

00:50:35
ANDY  I, I don't know. (crosstalk) 

00:50:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Like, you know, I mean we talked about the voice of negativity or the doubts, what's, what would you call the other voice in the other story? The other. (crosstalk) 

00:50:50
ANDY Uhm, I, I, I don't know. Positivity I guess. (crosstalk) 

00:50:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Positivity? 

00:50:55
ANDY Yeah, sure. 

00:50:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  You're not quite certain of that. 

00:51:00
ANDY Well, I, I don't know. I, I can't come up with a name for it. So. (crosstalk) 

00:51:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. I mean, another word you use was confidence before and will that fit? 

00:51:05
ANDY Uh hmm. 

00:51:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Any other words that would come from it? 

00:51:10
ANDY Uhm, maybe encouragement. 

00:51:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Encouragement. So there are places that sounds like where positivity, confidence, encouragement, knowing where I belong, uhm, do become strong, do, do become, ah, part of how you think of yourself? And they kind of serve as a counterweight, if you like, to the, the power of the, the negativity and the doubts. Is that right? 

00:51:50
ANDY Yeah. 

00:51:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. Uhm, I'm wondering, uhm, you said about how in the last five years, those things are growing stronger and the power of the doubts and the negativity and the lack of confidence has, uhm, diminished somewhat, right? 

00:52:05
ANDY  Yeah. 

00:52:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And you said that somehow in the work that you're doing now, those things are growing because you have the sense that you're doing something that you believe in? 

00:52:20
ANDY  Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:52:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE What? 

00:52:25
ANDY I, I, I, uhm, I still, I'm not, I'm very new at this I guess, and, you know, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:52:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE All right. 

00:52:30
ANDY so it does make cut myself a break but I, uhm, I don't feel overly confident in my work. 

00:52:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:52:40
ANDY Uhm. 

00:52:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE 'Coz you knew it? 

00:52:40
ANDY 'Coz I'm, I guess 'coz I knew that. (crosstalk) 

00:52:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Uh hmm. 

00:52:40
ANDY  And I know I have a lot to learn so, uhm, yeah I, I mean, I feel better about, I definitely feel good about myself more often than I feel bad about myself lately- 

00:52:55
Strong statement of counter-story 

00:52:55
ANDY - you know, uhm, 

00:52:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:52:55
ANDY  which is definitely. (crosstalk) 

00:53:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE How do you account for that, do you think? 

00:53:00
ANDY I think it's just, it's been time and it's, and its... (crosstalk) 

00:53:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Yeah. 

00:53:05
ANDY ...a lot of effort... (crosstalk) 

00:53:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:53:05
ANDY ...to kinda, ah, remind myself to do, to be more positive and, ah, and accept my good qualities. 

00:53:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. Tell me, do you think there's any value in these kind of experiences- 

00:53:20
Explores the absent but implicit 

00:53:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE - when it comes to working with people as a therapist, the experiences that you've been through? 

00:53:25
ANDY Definitely. 

00:53:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  In what way? 

00:53:30
ANDY Uhm, well I, for instance I had a, I had a client who is seemed very similar to me, you know. 

00:53:40
A counter story event on the landscape of action 

00:53:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Really? 

00:53:40
ANDY Who just, ah, ah, who's going through these, these same kind of things, you know, thinking about himself and if this is where he wants to be in his life and... (crosstalk) 

00:53:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:53:50
ANDY ...who he is and, and of all that, and, and I definitely drew on some personal ideas and, uhm, ah, experiences to, to help him. So ah. (crosstalk) 

00:54:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm, uh hmm. So would you say that your own experiences helped you to make a connection with him? 

00:54:05
ANDY  Definitely. 

00:54:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Do you think that made a difference for him? 

00:54:10
ANDY I, I'm almost positive. 

00:54:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Almost positive. (crosstalk) 

00:54:15
ANDY As, as, as well as positive. (crosstalk) 

00:54:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE But you really can't be? 

00:54:15
ANDY Yeah. 

00:54:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So as you think about that man that you worked with, and he was going through some of the things, uhm, that you could see a connection between your own experience. Uhm, and you think about the work you did that you just said was kind of positive and, and valuable for him as you speak, as much as he could learn. 

00:54:35
ANDY Uh hmm. 

00:54:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And what meaning do you draw- 

00:54:40
Shift to the landscape of identity 

00:54:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE - for yourself from that, from that work? 

00:54:40
ANDY  Well, experiences like that remind me of why I do what I, ah, why I'm doing what I'm doing, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:54:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. Okay. 

00:54:50
ANDY  Uhm. 

00:54:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Like what did it remind you of? 

00:54:55
ANDY It's reminding that I do have things to offer. 

00:55:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh-huh. 

00:55:00
ANDY And, uhm, and that, ah, you know, that I can be helpful, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:55:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:55:05
ANDY  It, it, it, and it felt good, you know? It felt good to have a connection with this guy and. 

00:55:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is it good to be reminded of that? 

00:55:15
ANDY Absolutely. Uh-huh. 

00:55:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Like what's good about it? What difference does it make? 

00:55:15
ANDY Uhm, well, ah, ah, it kinda pushes the doubts away. 

00:55:20
The power of the problem story is diminishing 

00:55:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Pushes the doubts away. (crosstalk) 

00:55:20
ANDY At least for a moment. Yeah. 

00:55:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm, okay. 

00:55:20
ANDY  You know, it gives me, ah, ah, a little bit of a high, you know. 

00:55:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:55:25
ANDY  Uh hmm. 

00:55:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So I'm kinda wondering what it would be like if you would ever, uhm, hang on to those moments a little bit more and to remind yourself of them a little more often, what difference that would make? 

00:55:40
ANDY I, I try. 

00:55:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:55:40
ANDY Ah, I do try and I think, uhm, a lot of times it works, you know? 

00:55:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:55:45
ANDY But it, but sometimes these thoughts just kinda consume(ph) me. (crosstalk) 

00:55:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE It's not like the negativity and the doubts don't, comes, sometimes come back. (crosstalk) 

00:55:50
ANDY Right, right. 

00:55:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  I'd like to pause in a moment and just, uhm, talk with Gerald again about what he's been hearing as he's been listening to us talk. 

00:56:00
ANDY Okay. 

00:56:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, but, just before we do that, can I just ask you, how's this conversation been so far for you? 

00:56:05
Reflexivity 

00:56:05
ANDY  It's been good. 

00:56:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. What, what do you, what's been good? 

00:56:10
ANDY Uhm, I, I feel very comfortable talking to you. I feel like I've, uhm, gotten a lot out, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:56:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Uh hmm. 

00:56:20
ANDY And, ah, and learned a lot out of it as well. I feel like, ah, ah, some, I, ah, it feels good to be able to express good thoughts that had bounced around in my head. 

00:56:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:56:35
ANDY I, I find it. 

00:56:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And that makes a difference? 

00:56:35
Storying the counseling conversation itself 

00:56:35
ANDY I, I did, it definitely does, yeah. I, (crosstalk) 

00:56:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:56:35
ANDY  I find that I often lived too much in my head... 

00:56:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:56:40
ANDY ...and I'm not able to express myself and it kinda got those thoughts out, outside. 

00:56:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:56:45
ANDY So it feels good to be able to do that. 

00:56:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. And does it, do the thoughts have any change that happens to them, as you get them out? What, what, what happens? 

00:56:55
ANDY I think in a way, they do. I think that, uhm, ah, I think that it becomes more tangible and workable... 

00:57:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:57:05
ANDY ...when it's, when they're outside of my head. 

00:57:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:57:10
ANDY And I can actually, uhm, ah, I feel like I, I have a, a little bit more power over them when they're out. 

00:57:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

00:57:20
A comment on the effect of externalizing 

00:57:20
ANDY Uhm, and then, and, and that they also, I, I have this sense of how true or, uhm, powerful they are or, or not, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:57:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:57:35
ANDY When they're outside of me and I, I can ah. 

00:57:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Do you think you have the negativity and the doubts at this moment? (crosstalk) 

00:57:35
ANDY I, I think yeah, I am, I am. (crosstalk) 

00:57:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE But when you put them out there and somehow they don't have the same power of you? 

00:57:40
ANDY Right. 

00:57:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Is that what you're saying? (crosstalk) 

00:57:45
ANDY Yeah. And, and a lot of times I, I've notice of, like, that, you know, if I'm thinking about things, it, it, it kinda, it can be overwhelming. 

00:57:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:57:50
ANDY But once I speak about them, it, it kinda, it's like, what are you, that is stupid. Why does... (crosstalk) 

00:57:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh-huh. 

00:57:55
ANDY ...that a, such a big deal, you know. 

00:57:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:57:55
ANDY  It's not that big of a deal. And it, it kinda makes it less powerful...(crosstalk) 

00:58:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:58:00
ANDY ...to, to be able to speak of, speak about that. (crosstalk) 

00:58:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:58:05
ANDY So, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:58:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Well, thank you for that and. 

00:58:05
Gerald Monk is an outsider witness to Andy's story 

00:58:05
DR. GERALD MONK  Ah, John, you've invited me into this stage of the, the interview with Andy and I'd like you to explain to me what my role is at this point. 

00:58:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. What I'd like to do is to interview you and I'd like you to speak to me, not to Andy, and just let him have a chance to be outside and overhearing, and, uhm, I'd like to ask you about what has been the impact of listening to what Andy has been saying for you personally, that's you as a person, not as an expert or a therapist or, uhm, psychologist or anything like that, is that okay? 

00:58:45
DR. GERALD MONK Yes. Okay. So you're gonna ask me some questions? 

00:58:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, uh hmm. 

00:58:50
DR. GERALD MONK I'll do my... (crosstalk) 

00:58:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So. (crosstalk) 

00:58:50
DR. GERALD MONK ...best to answer them. 

00:58:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So I guess the first thing I'd like to ask is, are there any particular things that Andy has said that kind of had an impact on you that had, ah, like a personal response, a personal resonance, something- 

00:59:05
How did Andy's words resonate? 

00:59:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE - that kind of touched you in some way that you, kind of, were affected by? Can you think of anything that, what did he say that. 

00:59:15
DR. GERALD MONK Oh, yes there were a number of things. I think the first thing was, uhm, I've been having this, ah, chorus go on and on in my head saying, "Always look at the bright side of life," tudup, bidup, bidup, bidup.(crosstalk) 

00:59:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Side of life. Right, yeah. 

00:59:30
DR. GERALD MONK So I've uhm, 

00:59:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE You're a Monty Python fan too? 

00:59:35
DR. GERALD MONK uhm, ah, and I've, sort of, being listening to that, ah, in the background and, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:59:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:59:40
DR. GERALD MONK I'm struck by how much Andy has incorporated that verse into his life. 

00:59:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:59:45
DR. GERALD MONK  Uhm, I, ah, I think, uhm, it's, ah, very difficult, uhm, for me and many of the people I talked to, to always be, uhm, in this state of, ah, complete self acceptance, complete embrace, and, uhm, having, so that you had confidence about all areas of your life. 

01:00:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:00:15
DR. GERALD MONK Uhm, I've never been able to achieve that. I'm quite a lot older than Andy is. And I'm struck by how much he has integrated a lot of ideas about life... (crosstalk) 

01:00:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:00:25
DR. GERALD MONK  and the purpose of life. 

01:00:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

01:00:30
DR. GERALD MONK And he's expressing and living that right now. 

01:00:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. So, say some more about how you've experienced that same- 

01:00:40
How does the resonance connect with your own stories? 

01:00:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE - kind of dilemma for yourself, the, the, you know, thinking positively as opposed to being undermined by negative thoughts or something like that. Hmm, you're saying, you've had, had a similar. 

01:00:50
DR. GERALD MONK Yes, yes, uhm, ah, I think at various different stages of my life, I've, where self-acceptance or belief that this is the right choice has, has, ah, come into my life. And I think it's often at times of transition where I'm moving out of, uhm, high school to, to university to, uhm, doing one job and then thinking, I don't know whether this is quite the right job and then, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:01:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:01:20
DR. GERALD MONK engaging in another area of work. 

01:01:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:01:20
DR. GERALD MONK  So, I've gone through a variety of different occupations and I think at, there's been many times in a state of transition in life or life stages. Where there'd been these questions, where I've been wondering myself is this, (crosstalk) 

01:01:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:01:35
DR. GERALD MONK  does this fit? Is this the right thing for me? And I, I, I would've been excited to have the degree of confidence that Andy seems to have in so many areas of his life at, at his stage, in a what to me seems like a, a big transition, of moving into... 

01:01:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

01:01:55
DR. GERALD MONK ...a whole new... (crosstalk) 

01:01:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

01:01:55
DR. GERALD MONK ...career. 

01:01:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  So for you, when you've taken those risks of putting yourself into something new, that's been the kind of circumstance where those negativity, negative thoughts of those task(ph)... (crosstalk) 

01:02:10
DR. GERALD MONK Yes. 

01:02:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...had become the strongest. 

01:02:10
DR. GERALD MONK Absolutely. 

01:02:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Right. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:02:10
DR. GERALD MONK Absolutely. 

01:02:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:02:10
DR. GERALD MONK  Uhm, and one of the, one of the things that were hinted at maybe, ah, in your conversation with Andy was, ah, this area, not only of this, you know, uhm, self-embrace or self-acceptance, but the words weren't used, but I was thinking of, perfectionism. 

01:02:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:02:35
DR. GERALD MONK And I heard Andy say a few times, you know, "I need to cut myself a break." 

01:02:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:02:40
DR. GERALD MONK I need to cut myself a break. (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

01:02:42
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So that was an expression that he used that, that resonated for you? 

01:02:45
DR. GERALD MONK Yes. It's like, hang on a minute, I'm just starting a whole new, ah, course of, uhm, activities in my whole life and I don't have to do what's perfectly or have everything figured out right now. 

01:02:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:02:55
DR. GERALD MONK So I'm warmed every time I heard him... (crosstalk) 

01:03:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Say, "Cut myself a break." 

01:03:00
DR. GERALD MONK ...sort of say that to, you know, "Hang on a minute, look, consider where I'm in." 

01:03:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:03:05
DR. GERALD MONK It was right. And I could imagine that being a very powerful resource for him, uhm, when negativity is kinda knocking on his door and those voices wanna come in and, and disrupt his harmonious... 

01:03:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:03:15
DR. GERALD MONK ...enjoyment of what he's... (crosstalk) 

01:03:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

01:03:20
DR. GERALD MONK ...doing at the moment. 

01:03:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. And when you think of, "cut myself a break," that expression, uhm, you know, what is that lead to you imagining? I mean, in your own experience, you know, had, had there been times when you've kind of cut yourself a break in that way and what, what difference does it make? 

01:03:35
DR. GERALD MONK Yes. Ah, ah, what it, ah, gives, has given me is freedom. It's like I don't have to perform all the time. I don't have to be perfect. I can get things wrong if things do not go well. I can, ah, sometimes, be affected by negative thoughts and be down at times. 

01:03:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:03:55
DR. GERALD MONK And that's okay. 

01:03:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:03:55
DR. GERALD MONK And the permission that I can give myself and that I hear Andy wanting to give himself, ah, creates a lot of space for... 

01:04:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. Permission. Hmm. 

01:04:10
DR. GERALD MONK ...permission to be and, and, and, and move on and through those negative moments. (crosstalk) 

01:04:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  So for you, it's, it's been ah, a matter, if I understand this, of not just accepting yourself but also of accepting the power of negative thoughts at times too. 

01:04:20
DR. GERALD MONK Yes, yes. 

01:04:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And they're gonna come back... (crosstalk) 

01:04:25
DR. GERALD MONK Yes. 

01:04:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...and they are gonna undermine sometimes and that's okay too? 

01:04:25
DR. GERALD MONK Yes, exactly. 

01:04:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  So, what, what, like, if you can do that, like what difference did that made for you? 

01:04:35
DR. GERALD MONK It, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:04:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Freedom is the word you used, right? (crosstalk) 

01:04:35
DR. GERALD MONK it, it, it, it hel, it helps move on much more quickly. 

01:04:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:04:40
DR. GERALD MONK With the next thing rather than ruminating for an extended period of time about where I messed up, where I didn't get it right or I... 

01:04:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

01:04:50
DR. GERALD MONK ...was down on myself or, uhm, and it, it, it just creates much more momentum to get... (crosstalk) 

01:04:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

01:04:55
DR. GERALD MONK ...through it, I think. 

01:04:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  So Andy, you had a chance to sit with your own thoughts for a little bit and to listen to what, uhm, Gerald was responding with. I'm interested on whether there's anything in there that's took your interest? 

01:05:10
ANDY  Ah, yeah, uhm, oh, it's definitely interesting to hear him speak about me in relation to him. 

01:05:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:05:20
ANDY  And, uhm, uhm. 

01:05:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE What was interesting about that? 

01:05:25
ANDY  Well, it was ah, I think, I think it's always kind of powerful to, to realize that my issues are not, uhm, solely mine. 

01:05:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:05:40
ANDY You know, that other people are kinda going through a lot of the same stuff or, or, you know, a lot of these, these self-doubts and, ah, negative thoughts and things like that are kinda, ah, normal, if I can use that word? 

01:05:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:05:55
ANDY And, uhm, I think that it helps to, ah, to hear someone like Gerald, who, you know, have a lot of respect for, to hear him say that he's, he's going or has gone through some of the similar things and is still continuing to. 

01:06:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

01:06:10
ANDY  You know, ah, ah, uhm, it just reminds me that, you know, none of us really know what to expect in life, I mean, we're just do, uhm, ah, 

01:06:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:06:25
ANDY you know, that there's, the future is so wide open, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:06:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:06:35
ANDY And, uhm, ah, to hear him just to kind of say that like he's going through similar stuff it just, it just reminds me that, uhm, how important it is to cut myself a break. 

01:06:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. (crosstalk) 

01:06:45
ANDY And that, uhm, uhm, it's funny, he was saying, ah, that he thought I was, I had some clarity, I'm like, it's funny. (laughs) I don't feel any kind of clarity at all on anything, but, uhm, I do feel pretty good about where I'm at in my life at this moment and... (crosstalk) 

01:07:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:07:05
ANDY ...you know, I'm just, I, I, to remind myself that, uhm, the future is unexpected. 

01:07:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:07:10
ANDY And, uhm, and to be okay with that. 

01:07:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, is there anything that you would take from hearing Gerald speak about those things? 

01:07:20
ANDY  Uhm, I, I think it's just a reinforcement of, of kinda living in the moment and, uhm, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:07:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Cutting yourself a break? 

01:07:35
ANDY cutting myself a break, and, uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:07:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:07:35
ANDY I, I like listening to people who have gone through similar things as, as me. And, (crosstalk) 

01:07:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:07:40
ANDY and hearing from their experiences so that, that, uhm, I can like, kinda learn from them. 

01:07:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:07:45
ANDY And, uhm. 

01:07:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  So would there be anything you can name at this point that you would like to take onboard with or learn from that Gerald was speaking about? 

01:07:55
ANDY Uhm, just to be, ah, patient and it's like I... (crosstalk) 

01:08:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:08:00
ANDY you know, uhm, I, I, he kept saying that he wishes he had the clarity or the, uhm, sense of, uhm, things as I do right now and he was (inaudible ) ah, ah, that feels pretty good to hear him say that. (crosstalk) 

01:08:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Uh hmm. 

01:08:20
ANDY That, uhm, and then also, ah, it feels good because maybe I'm, I'm doing better than I thought... 

01:08:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:08:30
ANDY ...you know. (crosstalk) 

01:08:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:08:30
ANDY Uhm, yeah. 

01:08:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So as you sit here and kind of think over what we've been talking about and what we heard Gerald speaking about, that's like a conclusion that you're coming to, maybe I'm doing a little better than I thought. 

01:08:45
ANDY Yeah. 

01:08:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Maybe I can cut myself a break and... (crosstalk) 

01:08:50
ANDY Right. 

01:08:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...understand things that way. 

01:08:50
ANDY Yeah. It's still gonna be hard for me to accept that, that negative, negativity is gonna happen, uhm, 

01:09:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:09:00
ANDY of you know, I've heard him say that he's, he accepts that, that, uhm, the negative, the negativity's gonna be a part of life and, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:09:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh-huh. 

01:09:05
ANDY and, that to uhm, uhm, 

01:09:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  So, that's gonna be hard. (crosstalk) 

01:09:15
ANDY you expect that kind, yeah, I, I, I don't want the negativity to be there. I would rather be a positive person all the time but, (crosstalk) 

01:09:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:09:20
ANDY but you know what, if, if that's true, I mean, I can't, it's, ah, there has to be that balance, you know? There has to be negative, negativity in order for there to be positivity. So, uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:09:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:09:30
ANDY uhm, I think, ah, ah, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:09:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE The contrast is actually helpful... (crosstalk) 

01:09:35
ANDY Right. 

01:09:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...in some ways to see. 

01:09:35
ANDY Yeah. 

01:09:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE All right. 

01:09:35
ANDY Uh hmm. 

01:09:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Uhm, I guess I don't expect you to answer this question, but I'll leave it for you to think about. And that is, uhm, what kind of balance would be acceptable to you? You know, like, if you were to put a percentage on it, for example. (crosstalk) 

01:09:55
ANDY Uh hmm. 

01:09:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE You know, uhm, with negativity having, you know, ah, 50 percent, 20 percent, 10 percent, what be acceptable? (crosstalk) 

01:10:00
ANDY  I've, uhm, when my immediate thought was 80/20, you know? 

01:10:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE 80/20? 

01:10:05
ANDY Yeah. 

01:10:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is that what you're saying? (crosstalk) 

01:10:05
ANDY Twenty percent (inaudible ) ah, 10 percent would be better. 

01:10:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay, and where would you say you are at the moment to do that? 

01:10:15
ANDY Uhm, well, ah, ah, at this very moment I feel pretty good, you know? (crosstalk) 

01:10:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:10:20
ANDY Uhm, I don't really feel a lot of negativity but, uhm, in my general life, before I commit to say that, I guess it's probably, ah, probably, hmm, ah, it varies, you know? (crosstalk) 

01:10:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:10:35
ANDY It's, it's difficult to say it that your... (crosstalk) 

01:10:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

01:10:35
ANDY ...and so, I think. 

01:10:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Well, there are moments when it's 80/20 and there's moments when it's a hundred percent and there's moments when it goes down to 50 or what? (crosstalk) 

01:10:45
ANDY Right. (crosstalk) 

01:10:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE I mean, is that, is that fair enough? (crosstalk) 

01:10:45
ANDY That's right, yeah. 

01:10:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. Yeah, I, I wasn't asking for any... (crosstalk) 

01:10:50
ANDY Right. 

01:10:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...absolute measurement for that. 

01:10:50
ANDY Yeah. 

01:10:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay, or any totalizing measurement 'coz, ah, you know, life shifts and changes, right? (crosstalk) 

01:10:55
ANDY Uh hmm. 

01:10:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Uhm, can I ask you this thing, just to, to finish? Uhm, what will you take away from this conversation that we've had today, including the conversation with Gerald, uhm, that you would like to hold close to you as you go forward, as you go forward in, in, uhm, making your life one that is closer to that goal that you would like, to have that, sort of, 80/20 kind of, (crosstalk) 

01:11:30
ANDY Uh hmm. 

01:11:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE that you mentioned, what would you like to take forward? 

01:11:30
ANDY  Uhm, ah, you know, I hate to keep saying it but, you know, just cutting myself a break. 

01:11:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

01:11:40
ANDY Just getting myself, ah, being patient and, uhm. 

01:11:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Can you think of one situation in the near future where it might be useful for you to cut yourself a break? 

01:11:50
ANDY  Uhm. 

01:11:55
[sil.] 

01:11:55
ANDY  well I think when I go back to, ah, ah, work tonight. 

01:12:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh-huh. 

01:12:00
ANDY So when I, ah, go back to the restaurant, uhm, I, I think it would be helpful to be able to, ah, just kinda, ah, I don't know if it's the right situation but kinda just, ah, don't get overwhelmed and cut myself, you know, a little bit of a break... (crosstalk) 

01:12:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

01:12:30
ANDY ...to... 

01:12:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

01:12:30
ANDY ...not try to be perfect. He said, perfect, perfectionism. 

01:12:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh-huh. 

01:12:35
ANDY And I wonder if I'm trying to, to reach this perfect state of mind and, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:12:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:12:40
ANDY uhm, so yeah, ah. 

01:12:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  So that's one place? 

01:12:45
ANDY I, I don't know. I think, I guess that's one place and I think there's probably other places but, uhm. (crosstalk) 

01:12:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. So if you could do it in that one place tonight, what would that mean? 

01:12:55
ANDY It will just mean having a better day at work. 

01:12:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. 

01:13:00
ANDY Not allowing the negativity of others to kinda bring me down and, uhm. 

01:13:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  And if you could do that... (crosstalk) 

01:13:05
ANDY Uh hmm. 

01:13:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...not allow the others to bring you down and have that one good day at work, what conclusions might you draw all about yourself from that? 

01:13:15
ANDY That I have more power over my reactions to things and my, over the negativity. 

01:13:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:13:20
ANDY Uhm. 

01:13:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  And if you can have more power over the reactions to things and the negativity, what effect would that have on the issue of confidence that we started about? 

01:13:35
ANDY Uhm, hopefully it would raise my confidence. 

01:13:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:13:40
ANDY And hopefully, you know, ah, I, I would just feel better about myself. 

01:13:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. 

01:13:45
ANDY Hmm. So. 

01:13:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Well, I think that might be a good place for us to stop. Does that sound okay to you? 

01:13:50
ANDY Sounds good. 

01:13:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. Thank you very much. 

01:13:50
ANDY  I appreciate it. 

01:13:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Thank you. 

01:13:55
ANDY Thank you. 

01:13:55
DR. GERALD MONK To deal with the stage of the process is to reflect on the interview you conducted with Andy. Ah, it would be really good to hear about some of the, the processes you were using though the course of the interview. Uhm, some reflections on some of the therapeutic, uhm, elements that, that featured in the interview. 

01:14:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. Well, no conversation goes according to, uhm, the book, uhm, but, uhm, there were in this conversation enough things that I think represents the kind of process that a narrative therapy interview would go through. Uhm, we started by understanding a problem story and, which was given various names to do with negativity and doubt and, uhm, lack of confidence, and we did some exploring of that story, (clears throat) not gonna be effects of it on Andy and locating it in the history and understanding how, you know, how, how it had got to be as powerful as it was. Uhm, along the way we were calling it "it" and externalizing it and talking about it and as a third party in his life. Uhm, and gradually, uhm, what was emerging, in fact, these things were emerging right from the start was a counter-story, uhm, a story of thinking, a story of cutting himself a break, uhm, a story of, uhm, ah, feeling good about where he was in his life, ah, feeling like he was, you know, moving forward. Uhm, so those things that came into, into contrast is, uhm, the conversation emerged and I saw my role then as, as seeking to grow that story, that counter-story and to keep the, the, the problem story and the counter story separate, in separate places. Uhm, and then, uhm, we have the opportunity where you came in and, uhm, I asked you some questions to reflect on it. During that time, Andy had the opportunity to sit back and listen, reflect, overhear, uhm, choose what things out of what you said, 'coz you said many things and he could choose which ones, kind of, connected for him. Uhm, and then we came back and had that final piece of the conversation, which was in many ways very much about places of difference, uhm, and what I heard as Andy was speaking in that last segment were some very different statements than the ones that he had started from. So, and to me there was a sense that there was a movement that took place in the course of the interview. 

01:16:20
DR. GERALD MONK  What were a couple of those things that stood out for you that were very different in that last phase? 

01:16:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  Well (clears throat) he was speaking about, uhm, uhm, doing things in his life that he believed in, that he felt good about, that, uhm, he, ah, had a sense of belonging in and that other people were confirming him. Even though the voices of negativity and of doubt, uhm, are going to return from time to time, uhm, (clears throat) those places were very strong. For me, you know, what makes the difference to things like confidence and self doubt is, uhm, not some kind of external evaluation, uhm, that some kind of, uhm, uhm, centering of oneself in places, in circumstances, in contexts which feel, uhm, positive and successful and Andy was talking about those kind of places. Uhm, he was talking about the importance of the work that he was doing with, uhm, clients and, and the process was, uhm, embracing that work, uhm, and, uhm, seeing it and understanding it as successful and in the process, cutting himself a break from the negative thoughts and the self-doubts that were there early on. I decided to comment too on, on this notion of self-doubt and, uhm, I'm not good enough, and I was curious as to what the history and the genesis of that was and Andy was speaking about it very much in relation to his experiences of schooling, especially his, uhm, in his younger years of, of schooling. And I don't think that's coincidence. Uhm, uhm, one of the, uhm, narrative assumptions is that people's internalized experiences are not unrelated to the contextual, uhm, influences that are acting upon them. And one of the powerful contextual influences in, that everyone encounters when they go to school is normalizing judgment, what, and Michel Foucault called normalizing judgment. That is, people are placed on some kind of scale and measured, and they are (clears throat) measured for how good they are at whatever it is, including things like popularity, uhm, (coughs) and so it's not surprising given the, the, uhm, availability of widespread normalizing judgment, that people are gonna reach conclusions about themselves that I'm not good enough, I'm not the right person, there's something wrong with me or, or internalize other forms of, of self-doubt. So, I don't see those forms of self-doubt or, or, uhm, uhm, or lack of confidence as necessarily originating in the individual's psyche or even in the family of origin so much... (crosstalk) 

01:19:00
DR. GERALD MONK Uh hmm. 

01:19:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...as products of social processes that internalize these ideas and these conclusions in people. (clears throat) And for me, what makes a difference to that is, uhm, uhm, developing, uhm, a close connection between people's actions, and the values, and the things that they believe in, and the things that they're doing that fit for them and their identity. So what I was most interested in as the conversation went on was generating, uhm, conversation about things that help promote and develop that sense of it, 'coz to me, the sense of being successful and feeling okay in one's own life isn't about banishing thoughts of self-doubt altogether, 'coz I don't think that's possible and I think you were speaking to that when you were talking about yourself, uhm, so much as it's about, uhm, finding, uhm, and embracing places where one can live and feel a sense of belonging and choice and preference and agency in one's own life, uhm, rather than, uhm, getting rid of the powerful forces of normally, normalizing judgment 'coz they're still gonna be there. 

01:20:10
DR. GERALD MONK Yes, yes. Uhm, and to you this was part of the, some of the core features of what was the genesis or what really contributed to, uhm, Andy, experiencing these, uhm, notions of himself were the products of these social processes... (crosstalk) 

01:20:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:20:30
DR. GERALD MONK uhm, back in a school... 

01:20:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uh hmm. 

01:20:30
DR. GERALD MONK ...context rather than say a family context which is a lot of therapists, especially family therapists think of as the source of a lot of problems or, uhm, or the individual. This is a, a set of social process. (crosstalk) 

01:20:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, and that's one of the first things, it can happen in families as well and that families themselves are not subject to various kinds of normalizing judgment. They're judged by social workers, for example, and that whether they're functional or dysfunctional. Uhm, so I mean, those things operate on families as well. But they also operate on persons as individuals especially as they go towards schooling. 

01:21:00
DR. GERALD MONK Okay. 

01:21:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Uhm, and I, what I'm speaking to here is I guess one of the assumptions that I make about, uhm, not something that I would speak to any about indirectly, and preach to them or anything like that, but one of the assumptions that lies behind some of the questions that I would ask and, uhm, about, uhm, because I mean, I think those kind of self doubts originate in social interactions... 

01:21:20
DR. GERALD MONK Right. 

01:21:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE  ah, rather than originate out of the heart of people. Uhm, and that's one of the reasons why I'm also interested in the counter-story being situated in social interactions as well, which was why I wanted to actually help, ask questions to help develop the story of, of Andy's relationship with his dad, with his fellow colleagues, with his professors(crosstalk) 

01:21:40
DR. GERALD MONK  Right. 

01:21:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE uhm, and with his clients, uhm, because I see the other, the counter story, the story of cutting myself a break, uhm, and, uhm, having a sense of belonging in doing the work that I am, am committed to and that I value, that also exists in social interactions. And, uhm, if Andy can make certain choices about, you know, uhm, holding those stories close to him, then I suspect that he will become less susceptible to attacks of self-doubt or negativity and, ah, not to those things that are gonna completely disappear... (crosstalk) 

01:22:15
DR. GERALD MONK Uh hmm. 

01:22:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE ...uhm, because they're part of the fabric of life, uhm, but that, uhm, they would have less power and as it, at the end of the, uhm, interview I heard him speaking about that, that those things were having less power. (crosstalk) 

01:22:25
DR. GERALD MONK Yes. 

01:22:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

01:22:25
DR. GERALD MONK  And then did you help him articulate in a variety of different ways, ah, that be in fact the case. Great. Well, I wanna thank you very much. It's, ah, been a great, ah, great session, a great interview. 

01:22:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Thank you, Gerald.
