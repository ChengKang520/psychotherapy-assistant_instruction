The 24th Annual Janet E. Helms Award for Mentoring and Scholarship Presented to Dr. Helen A. Neville University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 

00:00:35
DR. MARIE MIVILLE Good afternoon, everyone. Can you hear me? 

00:00:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:00:40
DR. MARIE MIVILLE All right. I am, uh, Marie Miville and I'm the, uh, the ever-present roundtable Director for this conference. And I'm very, very pleased to welcome you to our, one of our most special events for this conference, the Janet Helms Mentoring Award. And normally, we have this address, which is a very, uh, it's the time where we ask our, our award winner to just speak about their experiences, approach, and so on w-with respect to mentorship. And then, later in the afternoon, we have a special award presentation. But as all of you have learned this week, um, actually this winter, as well as I have - I've learned a new, uh, respect for the phrase "weather permitting" - 

00:01:25
[laughter] 

00:01:25
DR. MARIE MIVILLE So, we're actually going to have the award ceremony right after the address by Helen. So, I just wanted to do a quick introduction for Dr. Neville and then, in-invite her up, uh, to speak with you. OK? And so, as many of you may be aware, I actually, uh, am a student of Janet Helms. And I was here at the roundtable when the very first Helms award, uh, ceremony was done, given to Janet herself. And so, I actually remember driving up here with a group of students and, uh... We actually had wintry weather conditions that weekend as well. It's just part of our history. And, um, it was just so impactful for me to watch my mentor receive this award and it, it really struck home for me what it means to be a mentor. I truly appreciate what that means. And so, each year, we think very carefully about who we wanna honor with this award. And so, we're very pleased and proud to present this year's award, uh, recipient, Dr. Helen Neville. Dr. Hep-,...

SOCIAL JUSTICE MENTORING: SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUTURE LEADERS FOR STRUGGLE, RESISTANCE, AND TRANSFORMATION Helen A. Neville, PhD February 24, 2014 

00:02:40
DR. MARIE MIVILLE Now, Dr. Neville is an individual whose accomplishments range from the scholarly and scientific to, to the interpersonal and pedagogical, especially her impact on those with whom she works and teaches. Her scholarly focus takes on hard hitting topics that are both challenging and significant in their impacts on individuals such as the psycho-social cost of racism and color-blind at, uh, attitudes. Her work incorporates well known empirical methods to investigate social justice issues that just continue to affect all of us and our society as a whole everyday. More importantly, Dr. Neville takes her scientific work beyond the traditional laboratory. And she applies this towards helping others develop critical policies aimed at improving the functioning of our communities as well as motivating others for change. And I would like to mention just one poignant example of Helen's incredible work regarding her w-, her, uh, applications of her research with social policy - moving from the ivory tower just to the power of the people. And that's her work that she did in creating a policy statement regarding the Trayvon Martin, um, murder. And she describes how psychology and social science research must inform our interpretation and the ways in which race and racism bear out acts of racial violence, including the acts themselves, outcomes, and interventions. And I can tell you, those of us who were at the A.P.A. meetings in November had a very interesting conversation with some of the leaders of A.P.A. about the importance of psychologists needing to take a more public stance when it comes to the impact of racial violence, racial discrimination, and Helen's leadership with this policy is... just paved the way for so many of us. Her impact as well on individuals with whom she's come in contact, including students and colleagues from who you, who you will hear later on, also demonstrates her unique blend of strength and resilience in the face of difficult challenges while maintaining at the same time, amazingly, a very kind and considerate approach with others. You always feel she's listening to you and you only. That's amazing. And in short, Dr. Neville serves as a lifelong model of what it means to be a scholar, a social justice advocate, a leader, and a mentor. Please welcome Dr. Neville.

00:05:20
DR. HELEN A. NEVILLE I'm a little intimidated to speak after that introduction! (laughs) Thank you, Marie! Um... I am so humbled and honored to be standing here, um, and chatting with you a little bit about mentoring and to be honest, I didn't know, kind of, what I was gonna talk about. So, I tried to pull together the theme of social justice and some reflections that I have on mentoring. Hopefully, um, we'll have enough time at the end... I, I'm really curious to hear how you all are approaching mentoring, what you think is, uh, important, um, your thoughts about this notion about social, uh, social justice. So, we'll see how the time goes. I wanna also thank, uh, Dr. Marie Miville for all the incredible work that you're doing with the Winter Roundtable. If you guys can just join me in...

Justice is never given; it is exacted and the struggle must be continuous for freedom is never a final act, but a continuing evolving process of higher and higher levels of human, social, economic, political and religious relationships. -- A. Phillip Randolph We have to talk about liberating minds as well as liberating society. -- Angela Davis 

00:06:10
In appreciation of mentors... 

00:06:10
DR. HELEN A. NEVILLE (claps) Um... It's just incredible and I also want to acknowledge Mariel, who's just been doing a wonderful job and thank you so much. And my heart went out to both of you guys and your t-, whole team when the weather report started coming out and you all moved into turbo gear. So, I definitely appreciate that, um... Great. I wanted to start off with, um, just two quotes, just to help center some of our discussion today. So, the first quote is from A. Phillip Randolph, as many people know, who was a civil rights and labor rights activist and... "Justice is never given, it is exacted and the struggle must be continuous for freedom is never a final act, but a continuing evolving process of higher and higher levels of human, social, economic, political, and religious relationships." I really think this is powerful for a number of reasons. It makes its... It's, it's... It, it highlights that we should always continuously be struggling for something, even if we have certain gains that we've made, fights that we have won. The larger picture for social justice is always evolving and it deals with these interrelationships. So, I think that's incredibly powerful. And the second quote comes from Angela Davis. I just love her and her work. But part of this deals with some of the work that we do in the academy in terms of the role of "liberating minds" as being a piece of social justice or as being one of the critical components of critical consciousness. So, before I kind of begin and the way I want to kinda contextualize my work is to acknowledge people that have really been influential in my life. Um, and... So, I just... If you can bear with me while I acknowledge some of these folks and I plan on telling a story about each one of the people and they have been part of my kinda trajectory along my career. The first is, I wanna acknowledge my mom. I also wanna acknowledge my dad, who unfortunately, I didn't have a picture of him readily available so I couldn't put him up there as well. But my mom has been, um, just a tremendous source of support, um, modeling for me what social justice is, um, what it means to be a compassionate person living a life of, of humility and it, um... I just feel so fortunate. She died a couple years ago and so, it's always even now I'm thinking how I'd like to cry just 'cuz I miss her so much. I wanted to share two kind of examples, um, of her life that really, I think, hits home about how she served as a role model. Um, when, I guess when we had A.P.A. in San Diego and the folks were at A.P.A. in San Diego, they might have remembered we were having a boycott. Remember the boycott around the positions on gay marriage? So, my mom took a train - she's, like, 85 at the time - so, she takes a train from L.A. down to San Diego to experience, um, A.P.A. with me. And usually at the end of A.P.A., I always give my mom the bags. 'Cuz you know... She can use them for whatever. And while we were at A.P.A., she met Doug Haldeman. And Doug... I don't know if folks remember? Doug had those buttons with he and his husband on them about, um, g-, um, gay marriage and... So, she's, like, "I want one of those buttons!" Um... "'Cuz I wanna stir up conversation where I live!" So, she lives in a very... She was living in a, kind of, a residential community and she wanted to get them thinking about this and letting them know that this is something that she believed in. So, that's just a symbolic... This is someone who's 85, right? And then, shortly after that, I get an e-, uh, get an e-mail from her and she wants me and my partner to do diversity training at her, uh, home that... There's working now. These are 85, 90 year olds and she wants 'em to talk about issues of race and from a historical perspective. So, she arranged that and, um, in her life when she was employed, she was into public relations. So, she had the room packed! 

00:10:25
[laughter] 

00:10:25
DR. HELEN A. NEVILLE She had flyers out. She had, yeah, you know, like brochures. She was on the phone. And it was really a treat to see, you know, to talk about lifelong learning. You see these 85 year olds reflecting on and re-thinking their positions but also saying, "I've lived through this and this is my interpretation of that." And to engage in that critical dialogue. So, I really thank her for, um, being, um, being the person she is. The next person is Chalmer Thompson. And this is somebody that I worked with for just a year when I was at U.C. Santa Barbara. And Chalmer's also one of the students of Janet Helms and you know, um, so... One of the things that Chalmer did, um, I don't know if folks know her but she's this amazing, amazing person. And she would show me about what it's like to really mentor someone and I would remember I was a hot mess in grad school! 

00:11:20
[laughter] 

00:11:20
DR. HELEN A. NEVILLE I had a temper... I would challenge things, you know, have conflict and... She was never judgmental in that. I would go into her office and she would unplug the phone and I knew, like, this was our time together. And that was incredibly special. But in addition to that, she modeled to me in terms of the ethic of, of community, giving back to the community, the importance of that. The kinds of work that she's doing now is really important. She's working in Uganda around peace efforts and bringing counseling psychology there. And her work in Indianapolis is really centered around "how can I better the community." So she's been a role model and someone who's provided mentorship. Um, the next person al-, along my journey... Um, there's lots of folks that I'm missing but it would be Puncky Heppner who's over here! And I tell Puncky this all the time but it's nice to be able to acknowledge this publicly that he is the reason why I am still in academia. I would never have survived without Puncky and Mary as well. Um, it just is a, you know... I'm coming from L.A. moving to Missouri-Columbia. It was a whoa! It was something different! Um... 

00:12:35
[laughter] 

00:12:35
In appreciation of the many students who have enriched my life... 

00:12:35
DR. HELEN A. NEVILLE Um... And not only that, you know, yeah... I'm ambivalent about whether or not I want to be in academ-,... I'm not quite sure this is it. And he was incredibly supportive, um, showing me, kind of, the pathways, opening up, um, opportunities for me because I realized that when I was in, uh, started entering, um, you know, the job market, et cetera, I would find out that my colleagues knew stuff that I didn't. So, I was, like, "Oh, how'd you find out about that opportunity?" "Oh, my mentor told me. I this or that." So, Puncky served in that role. He opened up a lot of professional development opportunities for me. In addition, um, he showed how to do research. Uh, he showed me how to interact with students, always providing feedback. Just an amazing, amazing person. Um... Really, we were able to work together, uh, doing some leadership stuff around diversity on campus and really modeled to me what leadership can mean. So, thank you, Puncky, I definitely appreciate that! Um... and two other folks that come along later in terms of my career development, uh, Bill Cross and Derald Wing Sue, who's with us now. And just in terms of respecting the work that you guys do has influenced my own thinking but then, later in life, being able to come to m-,... Yeah, come to me and say, "OK, Helen, give me feedback on my work," helping me deepen my analysis, and now, even at this stage, opening up opportunities for me. And I really appreciate that and it's been fun collaborating with you as well as Bill on several other things. And the last person that I wanted to also comment on is Imani Bazzell. Because when I think about mentors and mentors in the academy and I think about social justice, it's also important that we acknowledge people who are in the community that provide mentorship for us, that help shift how we think about things, help shift our work and our community activism. And Imani is this amazing woman who is brilliant, brilliant, brilliant! That I learned from, not only about what the community's about, how to interact with the community, but also about just factual stuff. So, it really challenges us. I think, sometimes, we get in this very elitist way of saying that p-people, that we can only learn from people who have P.H.Ds. We can only learn from this. And really needing to expand, um, how we get our information from and so, she's been, uh... Since I've been at, um, Illinois for about 13 years, really been working with her and under her around her efforts, around looking at black women's health locally and nationally... Sort of value that and want to honor that. I also have peer mentors that I've worked with that I didn't have room to put pictures up on here but I think having peer mentors are important. These are people that you can struggle with, people that you can, um, uh, go through this journey. So, I wanna acknowledge Mary Heppner, um, who... We entered the academy at the same time and really have done some fun things together and I've learned from you. Also, uh, Lisa Spanierman who, uh... We worked together at, um, at, uh, Champaign-Urbana and I've definitely have learned a lot from you as a student as well as a colleague. So, I wanna appreciate that and Lydia Buki who's been part of this journey with me. OK. Um... I do... I also want to acknowledge that the many students that have really enriched my life that I have learned from and that inspired me and several of the students are here. So, um, Milo Dodson, who is, um, getting ready to finish up his internship and so, really appreciate you being here! Folks who know of any jobs who want a social justice-oriented...

Social Justice Mentoring - Is there such a thing as social justice mentoring? - Is it an approach to mentoring? - Is it a goal or outcome of mentoring? - Paul Kivel -- Are you mentoring for social justice? - Building an intergenerational community for social justice - Building leadership for long-term struggle - Help them take care of themselves better - Keep hope alive - Affirming and celebrating success - Providing critical feedback - Mutuality 

00:16:20
DR. HELEN A. NEVILLE competent person who's gonna definitely be on T.V. soon and shake up the world, Milo is the person to see. I also wanna acknowledge Valene Whittaker, too, who's doing some amazing things in the V.A. and has, um... Really appreciate the work that you've been doing around racial identity and we definitely need people working the V.A. system who has, um, a critical awareness about these issues. Also, Alexis Clark... Alexis and I go way, way, way back. Um... I've known Alexic-, uh, Alexis since she was an undergraduate and convinced her to stay on. And now, Alexis is also doing some important applied work with adolescents. She's done, um, sort of, work with the most severe kind of, um, people who've been incredibly traumatized and been able to work with them compassionately and now works with people in, uh, juvenile detention centers. Bryana French, who is also amazing, is on faculty at the University of Missouri-Columbia. In fact, she's, uh, got a position that I used to hold (laughs) so, um, it's so nice to see you doing the kinds of things that you do in counseling psychology and black studies and the commitment to, um, really questioning things around sexual coercion and violence. And so, I appreciate that. And Jioni Lewis, who just joined the faculty of the University of Tennessee, uh, Knoxville and is doing amazing work on gendered racial microagressions. And... Just definitely look out for her and the work that she's doing. So, thank you all for being here. It means a lot. Um, and I know that you guys did a lot to get your planes changed and that kinda stuff so, I feel very honored. Um, and just quickly, I just want to acknowledge my family, um, and they are the reason why, hopefully, I do things that you do - hopefully your family inspires you - so that we can, um, h-, um, create a different generation, a different ethic of social justice. Those are my step-daughters, my partner, and my six grandkids who are full of life and quite adorable. So, to the meat of what we're gonna talk about in terms of social justice mentoring. Um... So, I wanted to just try to pl-, envision what does it that we mean by social justice mentoring? Um... Not that I do social justice mentoring but maybe that could be something I could aspire toward, um, and so, I, I ask the question like: "Is there such a thing as social justice mentoring?" Um, if it is, is it a mentoring approach? Is it how we approach mentoring? Or is it just a goal or outcome we want to mentor students to be social justice agents? And so, I try to toy with that. So, for the remaining parts of my, um, talk today, I'll be talking about what we, what we might mean by social justice mentoring. Um... Paul Kivel has this... I don't know if people have seen this. You can access this on the web. "Are you mentoring for social justice?" It's an incredibly powerful short essay that begins to really grapple with what, what adults can do - anybody over 40. So, if you're over 40 and you're in the room, you can do this as well. How we can work with youth around building empowerment and around social justice goals. So, what I'll do now is I'll cover some of what he talked about. He talks about a lot more than what I'm going to discuss now. But I'll cover some of that and then, I'm gonna go to some of the, um, what implications I think about for the work that I've done, the work that I'd like to do, and then open that up for, um, questions. Um, before I go through this, I want to also acknowledge there's a lot of other programs out there that are doing things around social justice mentoring. But they are primarily focusing on men-, um, doing the social justice as its outcome. So, we have things on college campuses. I think Kennesaw State has a program that looks at mentoring students around social justice. Oregon State University, I believe, has a social justice program. Um... If you look online, there are social justice mentoring toolkits out there. So, there's some really good resources that are available to folks who are working with young folks on, who want them to adopt this outcome of social justice. Um... So, one of the things that Paul Kivel talks about is building an intergenerational community of social justice practice. And I think that's kind of interesting. He talks about the importance that we not only hang out with people who are like us but that we kind of hang out with younger folks. And because they can help identify what some of the social issues are that we need to be addressing. They can inform us on some of the practice. But these are also going to be our current and future leaders. So, building this intergenerational dialogue and I think many times, uh... If you think about the work that you do, who's in the room? Do you have people primarily at your stage in life and your development? If you do, why is it that you have that? Um... It would be important to have younger voices as well as older voices to talk about the problem and identify solutions. One of the other things that he talks about in this work is this building leadership for a long-term struggle. And I think this is particularly important during this time when we have... Everything goes so fast. People want immediate results and unfortunately, results don't come immediately. And sometimes, they might not come in our lifetime. But we have to sustain, kind of, this larger vision for this moving forward on whatever, whatever, uh, it is that, um, motivates us most. So, um, helping people strategize about creating a vision, helping people, um, build collaborations and working with other folks for this long-term struggle. The other thing that I think that was important that he talked about was this issue about taking care of themselves better. And anybody who knows who've worked with students, especially student activists, their time commitment is so stretched that they barely have time to eat. And so, how to really work with folks to prioritize the activities that they're doing but also to talk about how are you nurturing yourself. What are you doing spiritually to nurture yourself? What kinds of, um, physical activities might you do, be doing? So, looking really at this notion of self-care and I think that's incredibly important. One of the things that I've learned working with Imani, um, and the SisterNet that she always talks about this issue of self-care being particularly revolutionary. If you're working with, uh, marginalized groups because many times, especially like, we'll say, uh, black women, um, that they're the ones who are giving to the children, committing to the family, committing to the community, that this is really a commi-, um, an investment in the community. These are people who will be more likely to be present in the community and actively contribute. So, this notion of self-care helps the individual but it also helps the, um, helps the larger community. The other aspect is he talked about this notion of keeping hope alive as a way of, of thwarting off burnout. And I think that's incredibly important. We sometimes work so hard and we feel like we are losing certain battles and that we feel like we're fighting, uh, a losing, uh, war. But the fact is that many of us can have this long-range vision. So, one of the things that I know that was coming up, um... A, a struggle that was coming up when I was younger was, uh, apartheid and anti-apartheid struggle. And everybody said, "You know what? It's going to be a long time. It's not going to be in our lifetime when we see it dismantled. But we can chip away at that." And then what happens in the '90s? Things shift. The act, you know... So, things can happen and they can happen faster than we, uh, that we anticipate. It could take a little longer. But we also... So, we need to acknowledge these, um, victories when they come. The other aspect that's "keep hope alive" is to, that he talked about that I think is important, while we can be optimistic about the work we do, we also need to acknowledge the sense of hopelessness that some of the students or younger folks experience. Uh, we don't want to dismiss that or minimize that or sweep it away. So, how is it that you constructively can sit with this notion that, um, I'm feeling hopeless, I'm feeling like nothing's ever gonna change, at the same time of instilling hope. So, that's a really tricky balance to have. The other aspect that I think is important, obviously, is to affirm and celebrate successes - small and large - and to build that and... Affirming and celebrating doesn't have to be materialistic. It can be kinda verbally going through these successes. "You did a good job here. You were able to move folks there." Uh... "Let's, let's analyze, uh, your organization of this particular activity. Let's talk about the successes of that." Et cetera. The next piece of that that he talked about that I think is incredibly important and I'm not quite, uh, I definitely feel is well in the work that I do is this issue about providing critical feedback. So, many times when we work with folks, we wanna say we only want to acknowledge some of these successes but we don't wanna deal with some of the messiness around things. And so, how is it that you provide critical feedback that doesn't undermine their sense of efficacy? That allows them to name what's maybe some of their shortcomings are? Or how they wanna deal with that? That's something that I definitely struggle with. I'm a very direct person. You could probably ask my students. So, when it comes to providing critical feedback, I just say it. "This is what I think." And, you know... In reading some of the stuff, I'm beginning to think maybe that's not the best way to do it.

00:26:20
An Approach to Social Justice Mentoring: Some Considerations - Be clear and dialogue about your social justice orientation and potential goals (in classes and in "mentoring" relationships) 

00:26:25
DR. HELEN A. NEVILLE Maybe we should scaffold it. Maybe we should check in with folks and see how they think and how they're interpreting things. But it's a, it's a difficult, it's, it's harder than we think it is. And the, uh... Another aspect that he discuss - of course he has a ton of things, but these are just things that I think are, uh, critical and important - is this issue of "mutuality" and, um... An aspect of mi-, mutuality has to do with we are both learners in this relationship or these relationships. Thinking of Paulo Freire's work in terms of how he thought about education, that we're not just empty vessels to be filled up. I think the same about any type of mentoring relationships. That when you work with folks, they're not just empty vessels. They bring knowledge, expertise to the room. How is it that you nurture and develop and acknowledge that? As well as what can you learn and grow and, uh, from that particular relationship and what it is that they have to share? And so, that's a, a critical piece I think of this aspect of social justice mentoring. So, you know, I was thinking and toying with this idea about what an approach to social justice mentoring might look like. So, I have some considerations that I'd like for us to chat about. One is, um, one o-, one of the things that I learned is that we need to be - I believe decidedly - but we need to be very clear about our social justice-oriented, um, orientation and our potential goals. Whether it's in the classes we teach, the groups that we lead, our "mentoring" - I have those in quotations, you know, 'cuz I know that mentoring is a contested term - "mentoring" relationships. And there's a couple of things that, um, lessons that I've learned, um, that kinda lead me to that. Part of the issue, when I first came out, um, and was, you know, teaching 21 or however many years ago, I taught the Multicultural Issues class. And I made a lot of mistakes teaching that class the first couple times. One of the mistakes I made was I'm coming from L.A. where people deal with race to Missouri where it was kind of hidden and I think I show, um, "Color of Fear," like, the second day of class. I might have showed it the first day of class. 

00:28:40
[laughter] 

00:28:40
An Approach to Social Justice Mentoring: Some Considerations - Be clear and dialogue about your social justice orientation and potential goals (in classes and in "mentoring" relationships) - Model social justice values and practices - Respect multiple voices and perspectives - Encourage (difficult) dialogues - Acknowledge mistakes and ways you have grown (humbly) - Contextualize human behavior/treat people with respect - Provide counter-analyses (or narratives) - Work with community partners on social justice goals - Build of show the importance of alliances - Demonstrate work-life balance/self-care 

00:28:40
An Approach to Social Justice Mentoring: More Considerations - Provide meaningful learning & training opportunities - Critical awareness (power analysis) - Social justice practice - Work to transform learning & training spaces - Identify practices that create silences and inequality - Suggest and struggle for inclusive policies & practices - Offer support to navigate, learning, training, and work environments - Encourage folks to establish a mentorship network 

00:28:40
The National Center for Faculty Development (NCFDD) Mentoring Map 

00:28:40
By way of conclusion... - Social justice mentoring is both an approach and an outcome - Assisting in the development of future social justice leaders involves cultivating analytic tools, a long-range vision, hope for change, a commitment to life-long learning, humility, social engagement efficacy, and self-care. - Let's talk... 

00:28:40
DR. HELEN A. NEVILLE So, let's get a conversation going. Let's just talk about it and we spent the rest of semester unpacking what happened! (laughs) The trauma of, of that! So, um, one of the other lessons that I learned, too, was I would just include information about the histories of folks and show documentaries and have people come in and talk about their histories. And what students would tell me would be, like, "How is this helpful? What does it have to do with me counseling? Um... I don't see the relevance there." And so, I had to really re-think. Well, what's really happening in the room? Um, one, I wasn't explicit about how I think people learn and I needed to be clear in my own mind about how I think people learn about counseling. And one of the things that I realized that I felt as though students couldn't get to the counseling or any other piece if they didn't understand the power piece and the social, historical reality piece. So, I decided to do some research around one aspect. Um... When we would ask students, you know, what is it that you learn from the class? One of the things that they talked about learning from the class is, "I never saw racism. Now, I see it everywhere." And that got me into thinking about the construct of a color-blind racial ideology. That's really how I got it. It emerged from how s-, what students were saying about their learning process. And so, in, in working on the scale and doing research that unpacks how people deny, distort, minimize structural racism, you know, not only, just not only denying or minimizing, you know, racial differences, but structural racism, I wanted to see then is that even related to multicultural counseling competencies. Is that related to some of the things that we think are important? And yes, we find, empirically, it is related to those things that we find that are important. So, now when I teach the course, when I talk about my explicit orientation, is to develop a critical awareness, which is an aspect of social justice, a critical awareness about race and racism, about gender, um, oppression and discrimination, about, um, homophobia and heterosexism. I want pe-, if, if, um... that that is an explicit learning criteria and then, I know that, um, empirical evidence links it to be, people being able to conceptualize clients in a way that doesn't pathologize them, to be able to identify appropriate treatment intervention. So, um... So, that's one example of, of being explicit. Um, I've had to do this even when I teach African-American psychology courses, believe it or not, um, you would think, you know, most of the folks that I teach in that, in that class, 60 to 90% are African-American. I'm always, um, a little surprised by how when we talk about issues of structural racism, that is a source of problem and it's contentious in the classroom, even among folks who experience structural racism. It's this, uh... And so, really having to be very explicit in the class that this is a goal. But we, we talk about it, you know? And so, one ways that plays itself out is that many of the students would want to say, "Well, black students can be as racist as white students." So, we have to really spend time unpacking what that means and how these structural issues, you know, mean that black folks don't have power and even sometimes at the end of class, people still have these, you know... And I have to say that's part of... It's an ideological difference and this is my ideological belief and so, we put it out there. Um... So, the other... and I think those are important in terms of how we work with folks, too. Um, and especially in these mentoring relationships. That I provide, you know, I approach mentoring and how my outlook and, uh, views on career development from this social justice point of view, providing power analysis in terms of how we understand people's individual experiences in the academy and the workforce. That might not be students I work with viewpoint. So, I think it's important that we talk about where we're coming from in that relationship. Um, also being very, um, that while I might have this goal for myself moving toward social justice, I need to be, uh, respectful for the students that I work with - their goals and where they see themselves, even if they differ from, uh, my particular values. So, I wanna deal with some of these other, like, um, modeling, uh, social justice values and practice. Um, what I realize is that folks always talk about, "Oh, this person talks about this issues but in a classroom, they don't practice it. Um, in real life, they don't practice it. Oh, I love reading this person's writing but when I interact with them, it's a whole different story." And you know, people might say that about me as well. So, I'm not, you know, (laughs) I think these are things that I, I struggle with as well. But when I started thinking about trying to unpack, you know... How do we model social justice values and practices? - and again, these are things that I struggle with - is what's it mean to respect multiple voices and perspectives? Um... especially if they are perspective that widely differ from your own analysis. How is it that you honor that and welcome those? Part of, um, you know, um, respecting multiple voices also encourages who el-, whose voices is missing in this conver-, whose voices are missing in this conversation? Are the community members' voices missing in this conversation? Are student voices missing? So, really trying to also listen multiple perspectives and this is related to encouraging difficult dialogues. Um, and these are really, really hard. And I'm sure many people have had dialogues with their peers, um, other-, their colleagues. Um, but how to have those difficult dialogues about power issues in the relationships, the mentoring relationships that you, um, you have? Um, I don't think I do that too well. But, um, I'll give you an example. That's something I would like to do. I'm working with some students now on a project that I'll describe, I think... I think I'll describe it a little later. Well, maybe I'll describe it now and then talk about it, reference it later. For, um, the class... I taught the Multicultural Issues Counseling class. And one of the things I wanted to do in this class was to try to be much more explicitly social justice-oriented. And, um... I partnered with, uh, a colleague of mine, Rebecca Ginsburg, who heads the, uh, um, Educational Justice Project. So, basically, these, uh... She has a project in the Danville prison and she offers these, um, students, these prisoner-students, um, a U of I kind of experience. And so, we talked about... They were having some problems in, in the E.J.P. around... Well, it's a fabulous project. She's fabulous. But they wanted to look at their climate issues in the E.J.P. - how they can have increased sensitivity among the volunteers they work with and how they interacted with the students that were in the prison. So, we put together a social justice consultation project to begin to deal with this. So, the class to where, you know, they wanted the consultants and the, the E.J.P. program, uh, was a client. So, we do a lot of stuff to educate ourselves about the prison. We did a lot of stuff about how to train folks to do these focus groups with prisoners, how to train folks to do focus groups with these volunteers. We ran focus groups. We analyzed the data. We presented it. You know, we had a whole range of experience. And from my perspective, I thought I was very clear. "Who wants to do it? People wanna do it? Oh, OK." Everybody in the class wanted to do it. "Y-you don't have to do it. That's OK. Don't worry about it." Um, so, I thought I was clear on communicating people did not have to do that. So, we wrote up our, um, little experience, um, and we had, um, people who are co-authors are, uh, are the students. They took the, are the Counseling Psych students. They took the initiative on it. We also have the students in the prisoners as being co-authors and the, the person who works at the Co-Director of the E.J.P. So, we get feedback and one of the feedback is... "Well, gosh! It sounds like the students," - from the Counseling Psych student co-authors - "it sounds like they were coerced to participate!" And I was like, "Coerced? What? I don't think that was coerced." So, we just had a conversation about this and they said, "Well, yeah. I could see how that was." And, and some were saying, "Well, tell me more about that. Let's really talk about that." I just let it go. I didn't engage it, didn't talk about it. I just kinda let it go. So, in retrospect, this notion of encouraging difficult dialogues I, I should have... I think it was my responsibility to say, "Let's really talk about that. Tell me more about which ways people felt coerced. How can we do things differently? How does it feel now?" And to really engage in that and, um, I missed that opportunity but just... So, that's just an example. Acknowledge mistakes and the ways you have grown. I think this is, you know, as faculty members, we are always - and I'm sure as professionals in whatever roles - vulnerable. We want to appear competent. We wanna appear that we, you know, we're doing the things the right ways. And, uh... We don't. There's, there's lots of mistakes that I've, I've made. Um, I'll tell another mistake that I've made, um, recently. Um... One was around co-authorship. I feel bad about that. We had to respond to something and there was a lot of folks that were on it. So, we're responding to the article and I said, "Well, let's just have the academics - the first couple authors - respond." We did it and the folks are like, "You can't do that! You have to ask the students out-, authors on this." And I thought, "Oh yeah!" I felt really bad so we went back to the students and they said, "No. That's OK. We wish we would have been informed in the beginning part but it's OK to move forward on that." So, that was not, you know, that was a mistake that I made, had to, you know, acknowledge that, deal with that, learn through that experience. Um, I try to approach and I hope other folks approach things through humility and being, um, knowing that we have a lot to learn and there's many, many ways that we can grow from all of our interactions with others. I'm gonna quickly go through, quickly go through some of the others. Um, one is this issue about contextualizing human behavior and that, I think is really important. And this is notions of treating people respe-, with respect and I don't mean just people like when we have our interpersonal interactions. But I mean, we model to folks that we work with how we think about and view other folks. Do we talk about students and colleagues in front of folks that we work with? If we do, what message is that sending? Do we talk about people being under-prepared, doing this, pathologizing people? What does that serve? We're sending out... That's not a very social justice-oriented way of doing things. So, you know, one of the things that I'm trying to do now is when I do speak about, about difficult issues, trying to contextualize, be always contextualizing people's behavior, contextualizing the behavior of students that I work with, contextualize the behavior of colleagues that I work with and how I represent that person when they're not there. You know? That's what it is, you know... What, how do we think about and talk about and conceptualize people when they're not in the room? And how do we do that with respect and show that we value them? And I think that's incredibly important. Other kinds of things of, you know, when... Providing counter-narratives and that's primarily to larger groups and, um... Making sure that people see you working with community partners on social justice goals. It doesn't always have to be about research. It could be you working in the community on their social justice goals. I mean, it doesn't mean that you get something from it. It means that really that you're helping to transform, um, the community in which you live. OK... And just the notion of building alliances and I think this is... The more I work with other folks, the more I think I don't... I think it's really important that we help folks understand that we can't just look at our particular identities. I think there is time and space like for me to work with other black folks around racism but there's also need to work with other black folks and other, say, gay and lesbians around issues of discrimination. Um, to build alliances and allegiances and those are very difficult relationships to negotiate. And I think we can model that for our students about the importance of that and how to make that work. Oh... Demonstrate work-life balance. I think what I've had other folks say, you know, people, uh, you know, "I don't want to be an academic. I don't wanna do... I don't wanna be an activist. I wanna... People work too hard. They do this." Um, and if we ourselves are doing that, then, um, that's not the message that we, I don't think, we wanna communicate. So, really trying to also find ways that we can live in balanced lives so that we can be present for the people that we work with and mentor but also model for them that it is a possibility. So, couple of things that I think are important are providing meaningful learning and training opportunities. And the things that I think are important that deal with social justice are this issues about critical consciousness and Paulo Freire and other people when they talk about critical consciousness, they talk about two dimensions. One being, uh, critical aware, which is providing a power analysis, a structural analysis of some of our issues and then, um... Also, this notion of social practice, um, making, um, putting in, in practice, trying to change some of the inequalities that we see. And I think we can provide learning and training opportunities. Things that I have struggled with was starting off by having service learning opportunities and service learning opportunities are not social justice practice opportunities. And so, really trying to restructure h-, what does it we mean by social justice practice? And how can we incorporate those into - I teach a pro seminar class in Counseling Psych - how do we incorporate into those kinds of spaces? Things that aren't just "designated" as social justice? Have some thoughts about that but I will move on. Um, also, working to transform our learning and training spaces. I think that's really critical. Um, and you can do this at any level. One of the things that I've learned, if you're a student and you say, "I can't enact this. I can't do this because I'm a student but when I become a faculty or when I become a professional, I'm gonna speak up." Or f-, I know faculty who've done that. "I can't do this because I'm not tenured but once I get tenure, I'm gonna do such and such." Ix-nay! That doesn't happen. You ne-,... Now is the time. If you don't have these practices now, it doesn't have, it doesn't automatically happen later on in life. So, things that I think are important that we play a role in transforming learning and training spaces so we can identify the practices that create silences and what I mean by silences is who is absent? Who's not at the table? Who's not in the classroom? Who's not part of this experience? And then, start saying, "Why aren't they part of this experience? Is it dealing with some kind of inequality policy?" And then, what we can do there is start to suggest, um, and struggle for more inclusive proli-, policies to address these silences that are in the work spaces that we're in. Um, and we can offer, um, support to navigate learning, training, work environments. One quick example - I know I worked with someone who's an early career professional and she is doing amazing work around food justice issues. And she's out there in the community. And basically, the University - I hate to use those - is really exploiting her. "Oh, yeah! Go do this talk. Go do that talk. Yeah, be on this T.V. show." And then, not wanting to compensate her for the kind of extra work that she's doing. So, so she's like, "OK, well, maybe I can have a, uh, R.A. to help me do that." "No, that would be treating you differently. It's treating-, now, we don't want to treat you differently." So, really starting working with her about how is it we think about all the things that you do aren't like everybody else. How you are different based on your workload and then, coming up with the data and then, working to advocate for herself. That's just one example. The last one, I think it's really important that people establish a mentorship network. It's not just one person you need to be working with, there's a whole slew of folks to put together. And, um, Kerry Ann Rockquemore, um, who is the Director of the National Center for Faculty Development and she's got the mentoring map that help folks think about how is it they can build relationships around specific skills that they want to get at. And I just think, I wanna give a plug for that National Center for Faculty Development. Grad students, uh, faculty, I think it's great. It's a professional mentoring program. They do a great job. It focuses on diversity. Um, definitely check them out. Just a way of conclusion, social justice mentoring is both an approach and an outcome. Assisting in the development of future social justice leaders involves cultivating analytic tools for folks, um, giving them or helping establish a long-range vision, hope for change, um, your own personal commitment to life-long learning, your own humility, um, really helping people see social engagement efficacy that they can make a difference, and giving them opportunities to do that as well as self-care. Because I talked so much, I don't think we have time for questions and discussion. I'm really... I apologize, uh, for that. But I do thank you so much, um, for, uh, allowing me to speak on this topic, to think about what social justice mentoring is. I think that's really helpful in helping me, um, further the kinds of work that I want to do in the future. So, thank you.

00:47:20
DR. MARIE MIVILLE OK, thank you, Helen. Beautiful talk. And now, I'd like to invite, uh, one of, actually, uh, Helen's mentors, Dr. Puncky Heppner, to come up and present the award and we have a, a little bit of a special, um, opportunity here to share with Helen her impact specifically with people. Come here. 

00:47:45
DR. PUNCKY HEPPNER Great job. Well, it's a tremendous honor for me to, uh, present the Janet Helms, uh, award to my good friend and colleague, uh, Dr. Helen Neville. Uh, I'm gonna argue later that she's actually my mentor, uh, but that's another story. Um... By way of introduction, I wanna try to stack three levels... Stand back a little bit. Is this OK? Yeah. I wanna try to stack three levels of variables that I think kinda helps to, uh, get a sense of Helen and, and her, her energy, her passion, um, in this introduction. And I'll try to do it quickly because I'm aware of the time. Um, but... First of all, her research, her scholarship. Uh... As, as Maria talked, it's a incredibly high level. Uh, it's both incisive, uh, as well as very deep. Uh, I saw this in her work very early in her career and I was incredibly impressed with the complexity that she brings from Black Studies and other disciplines to try to understand what's going on in our societal system. She is not only incredibly productive - uh, 75 journal articles, book chapters, et cetera, uh, four books, uh, looking at this just from a number of dimensions - but it's also the phenomenal power and magnitude of her message that I think is so critically important right now. Uh, in essence, her research matters. Uh, I know this is gonna make her all a little bit, uh, self-conscious here. Um, I'll talk about that part later. Um, but it's also how she is conceptualizing the constructs that she is studying - uh, incredibly insightful, incredibly testable, which I think is very, very important. Uh, talked a little bit about color-blind ideology, uh, I also wanted to add into that her empirical and conceptual work on black identity in different cultural context around the world. Uh, she is, uh, very much a leader on this. Uh, and I think her work here is professionally profound. Uh, politically speaking, uh, I think that she is, uh, honoring the, the lived experiences of people in very different cultural context around the world. I think in the future, psychology is going to be there. Maybe it's going to take 25 years or more. Um, but this is an incredibly im-important dimension for us to think about as psychologists because we have a long, long history of being ethnocentric and focusing only on the U.S. and when you think about the cultural context, our research doesn't generalize to other cultural context. She is very much on to that page. Um... But talking about her research doesn't tell the whole story. Uh... So, level two that I think is very important to understand is that she is a very effective change agent. She understands the mechanisms of change very, very well. And if you listen to her talk on mentoring, you see the level of complexity that she's talking about. Uh, she's an excellent mentor - one of the best that I know. She understands the power of mentoring. She understands the lone voice in a room. And, and why it is so critically important to have other voices in the room speaking for social justice. This is about change. As she introduced her students, you can see change coming, uh, and the kind of things that they're involved in looking at. She, another example is, she came into Missouri in, as she explained, a very white environment. She's the first faculty of color and our program, I think, at that point was in our 47th year - something like that. Um, she was very instrumental in creating monumental change in our system. I've been struck with repeatedly, uh... Some of my most conservative colleagues would come up to me and say, "Gosh, I, I heard, uh, Helen Neville talk today. She is really smart." I was like, "Holy cow! (laughs) Um, what is she saying?" (laughs) Um, she understands that change process and she was very instrumental in transforming our program to where we are today in terms of being recognized nationally for what we're doing in multicultural ar-arena. The truth is, she is my mentor. Uh, I have learned tremendously from her about this process. Uh, numerous times, I felt like we were, we were kind of in a hole and, uh, everyone not knowing what to do or say and Helen says, "Oh, well, we'll just kind of da-da-da da-da-da. Oh." And she says that so matter-of-factly, I'm kinda like, "I believe her! OK. OK." (laughs) Uh, very effective. Uh, and without her, we would never have progressed in that manner. Not surprisingly, she's received numerous awards. Uh, I won't go through all of those but for her research, teaching, mentor numerous times. Most recently, A.P.S.I. recognized her as Distinguished Psychologist of the Year. Um... Also, as a change agent, how important it is to be serving on editorial boards of our journal. She served on seven of those. Uh, she's been Associate Editor of our two journals. Oh, now we're talking ano-, a lot of opportunities for social change. But still, the story about Helen is not complete. Um... and perhaps, most importantly, most basic is who she is, uh, how she, how she interacts with people, uh, how she makes people, uh, feel like family and that is so important. Her humility, as you saw today, her spirit, her passion, her compassion, and her heart. Um, and part of the way that I think that happens is she shares her family with people. I remember meeting Lil, her mother, and I was struck with, "Wow. What, what a phenomenal and remarkable woman." Uh, incredibly bright, uh, and funny. Uh... and many times, I feel like she was kind of mothering me and it was like, "Oh, wow! This is really so nice!" (laughs) Um... I know, (clears throat) I know she's very proud of Helen and I know she's very proud of her today especially. Um, but others... Her, her brothers, nieces, nephews, uh, other relatives, uh, have all been important people in, uh, the lives of Mary and I. So, it's, I think it's all, all of these things that come together, uh, that are stacked together that tell the story about her and these values underlying her research, her teaching, her mentoring, and really are a part of her legacy. She integrates these in an incredibly effective way, an incredibly powerful way. I-it almost goes without saying we need more people like Helen in our profession. If we could figure out how to clone her, we'll really be in good shape for the next few years. Now, we've got some of her students coming. And so, that's great. (laughs) Um... But these relationships are depicted in the, the wonderful words that were developed for the plaque and I, I wanna invite her students down. Uh, their words are all over this plaque but other people - I, I know Lisa Spanierman and, and other people as well - are in this very powerful plaque. And so, uh, I'll call them and they're gonna read different sections of this at this time. 

00:55:55
DR. BRYANA FRENCH Hi, Helen. It's an honor to be here. So, we wanted to read the plaque that we, uh, helped contribute to about your greatness. We're in order, uh, developmentally from when you took us under your wing. So, I'll go first. Uh, Helen, you are a gift to this profession. One page is not nearly enough space to express your greatness. You devote genuine energy to all that you do. You don't just mentor your students, you build lasting relationships. When we look up the word "mentor," we should see your picture. You have an ability to articulate and contextualize feelings of different-ness and help students sort through their unique experiences. You're always there to express your belief in your students' abilities. You walk side by side with young scholars to help them navigate the challenges of academia. You help your students find the power to use their professional roles to foster meaning in their lives and in the lives of their communities. 

00:56:55
DR. VALENE WHITTAKER Of the many things to appreciate about you, one of the most important is your genuine concern and care for others. Your care extends beyond the office and the classroom. You continuously provide professional and personal support whenever it is needed. You open the doors of your home for program potlucks that enhance the student community and always make an effort to stay connected with your students during all phases of your, of their career. You have a remarkably supportive, nurturing quality that abundantly contributes to the well-be-, um, to the well-being of those who know and work with you. It is a blessing to receive your mentorship. How do we identify those who offer expert mentorship? An expert mentor is one who provides such profound wisdom and insight through her feedback that her students are steered to genuinely appreciate that reception. You are representative of an expert mentor and as you go beyond, as you go beyond what is expected to provide exceptional guidance. The professional efforts of your mentees are a direct reflection of the quality of your mentorship. 

00:58:05
DR. JIONI LEWIS Your approach to scholarship establishes research as an artistic form of communication. You don't teach students how to create research questions to receive answers but to learn to ask better questions. Your creative and insightful research program on racial color-blindness is highly relevant in the current political and economic context and helps us to make sense of our day to day lives. Your nuance and artful work on theorizing black identity in traz-, transnational context is groundbreaking. The narratives you unveil in your work expose the professional community to perspectives that spark compassion in hu-, about humanity. You ignite others' passion for scholarship. You're not only an innovative and impactful researcher but you are a cultural ambassador as well. Your commitment to social justice is precisely what should be rewarded and reproduced in the academy. It is no surprise that you are high, highly regarded by your colleagues and peers. You serve as motivation to achieve personal and scholarly greatness. 

00:59:10
MILO DODSON On top of your countless accomplishments, you are extremely humble, generous, and kind. You are approachable, available, warm, caring, empathic, supportive, humorous, and just a genuinely great person. Just as with your mother, Lillian Neville, being in your company makes others feel good about themselves. You know your students incredibly well and you are activel-, you actively engage them in many respects. You accommodate the needs of your students and provide limitless personal and professional support. You have an innate capability to develop great professionals, as well as empower them to understand their own assets. You have a unique talent of identifying and fostering one's potential. The energy you invest into culti-, cultivating that greatness in others is appreciated. Your contributions in others' lives are truly unsurpassed. You are truly an exemplary person. Those fortunate to call you their adviser, mentor, and friend can agree on how deserving you are of this est-esteemed award and representative of the legacy of Dr. Janet Helms. Thank you for being so impactful and so memorable. Now, it is our turn to celebrate you with this honor.
