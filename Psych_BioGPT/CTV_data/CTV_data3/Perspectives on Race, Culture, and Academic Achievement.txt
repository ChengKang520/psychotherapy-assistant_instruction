00:00:00
  Thank you, Patricia, and welcome ah, to all of you again. I got to visit with you ah, first thing yesterday morning at the beginning of the conference. Uhm, Happy Valentine's day to you also. It's the day of love. I hope you get lots of hugs and kisses from special people. It is indeed my, my great honor to introduce this morning our key note speaker who will address the topic, "Brown versus Boards Jubilee Anniversary: Perspectives on race, culture, and academic achievement." This topic is being addressed this morning by one of our nation's eminent ah, scholars uhm, in the area of uhm, school and higher education desegregation, and you all know that. I, I'm rather embarrassed to try and ah, introduce him because so many of you already know him. Ah, Dr. James, better known as Jim Anderson is professor and head of the Department of Educational Policy Studies at the University of Illinois. Ah, he earned his PhD in the History of American Education, also at the University of Illinois. Ah, Dr. Anderson has had a distinguished career as an educational historian focused primarily on equity issues in education. His 1988 book, the Education of Blacks in the South, 1860 to 1935 is the definitive text for scholars in this field. The book received the AERA Outstanding Book Award, the American Educational Studies Associations critics choice award, the Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Human Rights in the United States, Outstanding Book Award. Dr. Anderson has served as an expert witness in school desegregation court cases in St. Louis and Kansas City, and in the higher education cases Knight versus the State of Alabama and the, and U.S. versus Fordice in Mississippi that resulted in a landmark decision by the Supreme Court, U.S. Supreme Court regarding the desegregation of higher education. Professor Anderson also provided historical testimony and findings of fact in the landmark case in the U.S., in the U.S. Supreme Court, ah, the Gratz versus Bollinger case that addressed the legality of the University of Michigan affirmative action plan. He's currently one of the leaders of the University of Illinois campus committee preparing a national conference to address Brown versus ah, the Board of Education Law, and Educational Policy. And this national conference will occur April 1, 1st through 3rd 2004. Ah, Professor Anderson is also an honorary professor at Hunan University in China, Normal University in the People's Republic of China. He is the winner of Spencer mentoring, of a Spencer mentoring grant, and he has supported the research of 30 African-American Latino and Latino doctoral students. So, you see he doesn't just spend his time in his office writing books. With all that said, I as, as I commented earlier, I'm sincerely honored to present ah, Professor Anderson to you this morning. He's presented similar presentations already ah, at the, at Yale University and at University of California, Berkley. So, Race 2004 is happy to bring him to you. Jim?

JAMES ANDERSON  You told me, you wouldn't do all of that, but thanks, anyway. (Clears throat) 

00:04:50
  I cannot take it(ph). 

00:04:55
JAMES ANDERSON (Laughs) Okay. And for young people who are here particularly (clears throat) uhm, undergraduates uhm, don't pay too much attention on those introductions. Uhm, (clears throat) it only takes age to get there. 

00:05:10
 (Laughing) 

00:05:10
JAMES ANDERSON  Ah, thanks for inviting me. And uhm, as I've been here, I feel (clears throat) with each passing moment ah, more or less like a fish out of water. Uhm, (clears throat) and uhm, I've started to engage some of the conversations. Ah, yesterday afternoon, I met Melvin Hall(ph) and uhm, explained to me the meaning of construct validity,- 

00:05:35
 (Laughs) 

00:05:35
JAMES ANDERSON - and so (clears throat) I may have more questions today than I have yesterday. Ah, (clears throat) I am ah, pleased to be here this morning, and, and thanks for inviting me, uhm, not only ah, to come to the Race Conference that I've never been to before, and I've heard so much about it. And uhm, I could now tell people, "I finally made it to the Race Conference." And also because friends and colleagues who are here uhm, and former students of mine who are here, uhm, I don't think I'll point them out because uhm, it only shows how anxious I am. (crosstalk) 

00:06:10
 (Laughing) 

00:06:10
JAMES ANDERSON (Laughs) But ah, ah, it's good to be among ah, friends and, uhm, ah, ah, and I wanted to be here. What I want to do is ah, talk to you about three things this morning. About two years ago, uhm, I wrote a proposal to the University of Illinois to do a year-long commemoration of Brown v. Board of Education (clears throat). And we are in a process of doing that, and what I was thinking at the time was that, uhm, and I chose the word commemoration very carefully as opposed to celebration. That it's not so much to celebrate a decision, but then it would be an occasion to reflect on what we've done of the past 50 years (clears throat) on issues of segregation, ah, equality, and a whole set of issues related to Brown. And let me start ah, by saying what the Brown decision means to me, and why I think it's important to commemorate it (clears throat). Uhm, I think Brown redefined the meaning of equality in American society, and that was not only about school desegregation, it's what happened after Brown that most of what we think of as equality today in the field of bilingual education, gender equity, disability, sexual orientation, and the whole range of issues are what I would call, children of Brown v. Board of Education. And we cannot imagine that progress if Brown had not redefined the meaning of equality of opportunity in a democratic society (clears throat). And what it says in effect is that all children have a right to attend school without discrimination whether they are disabled, ah, irrespective of sexual orientation, or gender, or race, and so forth. And so, (clears throat) despite ah, the concerns we have today, we argue them, we debate them on terrain that is very different than what existed in the pre-Brown era. Now, having said that, (clears throat) ah, most people who were writing about Brown today will have some subtitle about Brown's troubled legacy and those (laughs) some of the things I wanted to ah, discuss this morning. Now, with the three questions, they come from three different papers I've been writing. A couple of completed and one in the process of being completed that I wanna discuss with you and then have a chance to have questions of some, some dialogue with you about those. One is, what accounts for the persistence of school segregation 50 years after Brown. I mean, we know that we not only have segregation, but uhm, ah, scholars like Gary Orfield and his ah, civil rights project at Harvard that keeps track of the segregation knows that we are now increasing the segregation of students in American schools. Ah, we had a period in the post-Brown era, particularly in American south whether there was a massive resistance. And then about 1970 ah, most of the desegregation have occurred in American ah, public education happened in the southern states in the 1970's and the 1980's. But by the time we reached the 1990's, re-segregation was well under way, and today ah, racial and ethnic minorities are more segregated than they have been at any time ah, in the 20th century. And so, we really are living in the society where segregation is increasing not decreasing (clears throat). That should raise the question for all of us. What accounts for the persistence of school segregation in the society. A second question (clears throat) which really has, that many scholars have decided is the most puzzling legacy of Brown v. Board of Education is the so-called... (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
 (Coughs) 

00:09:40
JAMES ANDERSON ...racial gap in learning. Now, and so, one of the question is what should we make of the racial gap in learning? Ah, and uhm, ah, and why do we consider it to be the most troubled in legacy of Brown v. Board of Education. And the third question, (clears throat) what should we make of the renewed emphasis on the role of African-American family culture and shapen the intellectual development of Black children even before they enter school. This is something that is also being discussed very much today, and I think had some implications for uhm, ah, people who are concerned with irrelevance of culture not only in assessment and evaluation, but also in explanations of academic achievement. The first part is ah, the part that I like, and you won't like, maybe it's a history part (laughs). But indulge me as I talk about ah, what I think accounts for the persistence of segregation ah, 50 years after Brown. I think one of the things that we did was to focus on the American south, and that was a mistake in 1954. Ah, somehow, we thought that the Jim Crow South is system of legally mandated ah, ah, segregation represented the essence of segregation in the American society, and that Brown v. Board of Education which ended legally mandated segregation would be a way to end school segregation in the society. And by focusing on the American south, we ignored the long historical past of segregation in America that dates back to the antebellum period, and there were lessons there. Fifty years before Brown that would have told all of us where we would be in 2004 if we have paid attention to those lessons. And I wanna speak a little bit about those lessons (clears throat). And a wonderful book called, "The Strange Career of Jim Crow," see then what with the latest story and see then what, what pointed out that legally mandated segregation or what we called Jim Crow was born in the north, not in the south, and what he meant by that profound insight is that the first establishment of Black Codes, laws against African-Americans voting, going to school, serving on jury, serving the militia, interracial marriage, first appeared in northern states in the early 1800's. And the northeastern states and the mid-western states, and the western states. And also laws to ban African-American from residence in those states. During the whole of the antebellum period that is up until the time of the civil war, only one state, Massachusetts in 1855, outlawed public school segregation. All of the other states mandated a segregation (clears throat). And those codes were pretty severe. Now, (clears throat) what is interesting in that, they extended even beyond the civil war era. As of 1870, even after the passage of Fourteenth Amendment. Most of northern states denied African-American the right to vote by law. And so, those codes were still in place. And then we get a very interested turn, in northern society as a consequence of the civil war amendments 13th to 14th to 15th Amendment. And that is a sense, that the guarantee of constitutional equality is the way to go in terms of state laws ah, on, on a number of civil and political issues. So following 1870, all of the northern states changed their laws. And they actually outlaw segregation, ah, in public places, uhm, and with regard to civil and political equality, ah, right to vote, serve on juries, all of these changes, and what you get state by state is a guarantee of constitutional equality. And that was pretty much in place by 1900. If you fast-forward 50 years later, in spite of laws, banning public school segregation, segregation in northern states was much greater in 1950 than in 1900. So, sort of continuing on one of the things that Richard Duran(ph) talked about yesterday that is the contradictions, and so dialectical materialism. You see those contradiction between the guarantee of constitutional equality and increase in segregation. (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
 (Coughs) 

00:13:55
JAMES ANDERSON And it raises a question, how could that be? How could northern states pass laws, banning public school segregation, and at the same time you get sharp increases and the segregation of racial and ethnic minorities students. Well, (clears throat) the short answer, and I suppose you must prefer the short answer, (laughs) is that, that throughout the northern states, throughout local districts, as a move to change formal equality before the law, they also established institutional practices and cultural norms that strongly favored racial segregation. And we now have evidence of what they were like. One of the more, ah, favorite ah, things to do was (inaudible ), school attendance zones, so that kids would be segregated by race. But there were also segregation within schools, by buildings, by classrooms and so forth, liberal transfer policies for Whites only, so White students could transfer out of districts that would becoming increasingly uhm, ah, composed by uhm, African-American and other race and ethnic minorities. So, they developed a whole set of institutional practices, which actually encourage and embrace segregation, and so what we had on the country was a notion that we do have constitutional guarantee of equality, but you don't have to worry about the translation of a law into institutional practices. That institutional practices will, in fact, preserve segregation, and they did. Now, (clears throat) it wasn't until the Denver versus Keyes case in 1973, that the Supreme Court finally recognized that segregation whether de facto or institutional was just as intentional as legally mandated segregation. And what they have found in the Denver versus Keyes case was that in Denver, Colorado, they locate the schools in such a way as to intensify segregation within the school district. They have liberal transfer policy. The (inaudible ) school attendance zones. They assigned teachers in schools on the basis of race. They did all kinds of things to make sure that segregation was preserved. Precise to the things that they've done in northern states before Brown v. Board of Education. And so as I looked back over this long historical past (clears throat) what I realized is that what we could have anticipated after Brown was the same thing that actually developed throughout the country in the aftermath of the guarantee of constitutional equality by northern states in the late 19th century. And that's exactly what we got in southern states. First, we got massive resistance. And we don't have a word like that, that characterize the developments in northern society, even though we did have massive resistance in the same place, and that happen in very similar ways. And then there were some degree of the segregation for short time and now in southern states we get re-segregation and pretty much the same way, and they used and basically... (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
 (Coughs) 

00:16:40
JAMES ANDERSON  the same kinds of tactics. And we stand here in 2004 more segregated than ever because we live in a country where the institutional practices and culture norms favor segregation. And we can live very comfortable with that. And one of the things that, that, that the Jim Crow system did ah, to make the country very uncomfortable was that at the time, in particular, the post-World War II era as we thought the Cold War, other countries, in particular the Soviet Union, used the existence of legally mandated segregation as evidence to the world that this nation was hypocritical about the meaning of democracy. And it was in the, it was a very powerful weapon and despite for the alliance of countries around the world. And so that was very powerful motive and other motives in the country to get rid of ah, legally mandated segregation. And so they did with Brown v. Board Education. But the fight, and it's unfulfilled promise of Brown still with us because we're, we yet, ah, we yet to attack the institutional practices and culture norms that preserves segregation and that's what we are today (clears throat). And I think that's one of the things that, ah, one of the reasons I want to uhm, to emphasize uhm, ah, this commemoration ah, to reflect on that, and we see that around the country. One of the first cases uhm, ah, in the Brown's, ah, the five cases of the, for the Supreme Court was Clarendon County, Clarendon County, South Carolina. Today, they're still arguing that case, and they're still fighting that case. There's a William versus California, another kind of case. Ah, so the struggle for, ah, ah, the segregation and the struggle for equality is still under way ah, and is growing to be a challenge for some time to come. And I think we have to focus not so much on the law, ah, but on institutional practices and culture norms ah, that, that's gonna ah, be a challenge to us. Now, the second question. I'll be the one to turn to, was the racial gap in learning that was viewed as a troubled legacy of Brown v. Board of Education. And, I think, the two are related because in some ways that justifies contingent segregation. I've been reading uhm, the Thernstrom's book, "No Excuses," calls in the racial gap in learning. And if you go through that chapter on African-American students and I'll come back that, come back to that again when I discussed culture, they described a student population that justifies segregation because what it says on a fact is that what parents would wanna place their kids in schools with a population of students whose family culture does not value education. They're prone to get in fights and disrupt the classroom. They have a teen culture where they watch television and they listen to rap music. And they have no interest in learning. And that the only way to respond to that was vouchers and transfer policies to get your kids away from them, so they won't be dragged down by the same kind of anti-intellectual culture. And so, when I hear these arguments in 2004, they remind me of the justifications in 1904 or 1924 or 1954, when northern school districts were justifying policies of segregation so that their children would not be corrupted by the culture and the anti-intellectual values, of course then, there was a theory of biological inferiority of African-American students, as well as other racial and ethnic minority students. And so, that is still with us today and I think that's why it's important to uhm, to, to consider what people now, ah, define in ethnic(ph) trouble legacy of Brown v. Board of Education. First, I wanna say that the achievement gap is not the most troubled legacy of Brown v. Board of Education. The persistence of segregation is still the troubled legacy of Brown v. Board of Education. But I do wanna make some comments about achievement gap, what should we make of it. One, (clears throat) when I look at the history of African-American student achievement, in particular, from the post Civil War era until the late 1980's, there is a study increase of academic achievement and no declines, okay. And the increases are so significant that by the late 1980's, American scholars was writing about the disappearance of the achievement gap. You know, remember the Jeanne-Brook on Black White Test Score Gap? There were chapters in there, saying that achievement gap is soon to disappear. And the reason scholars thought that, was 'coz both African-American and Latino kids from 1970 to the late 1980's had cut in half the gap on things like nake, ah, NAPE scores and others. And so people really thought this gap won't... (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
 (Coughs) 

00:21:40
JAMES ANDERSON ...be around very long. And then all of a sudden in late 1980's and the early 1990's, the scores for African-American students and for the Latino students decline somewhat while white scores remain flat and the whole nation then focused then on the racial achievement gap. I have a couple of questions. One, I want to know, (clears throat) how do we get settled (laughs) with the achievement gap after, how many years is that, roughly, 1867-8 to 1988. After that many decades of, of, of, of achievement of study increases in achievement. Ah, how do we get settled with the responsibility for the achievement gap? And here a, I think, where the political underbelly lies. (clears throat) recall that in 1983, how do we defined achievement gap with Nation at Risk? We defined achievement gap as a difference between the test scores of American students and the scores of other students and other industrialized democracies, right? I mean, that's what Nation at Risk was worried about. And then, Reagan and then Bush and later Clin promised that by the year 2000, American students will number one in the world in Math and Science, that was a promise, okay. We know where they were in 2000. Of those 21 industrial democracies that take those test, only Lithuania, South Africa and Cyprus were below us. So, we did make it to be number one. Though the achievement gap is still there. But American politicians redefined the achievement gap and you go to the Department of Education website, the achievement gap is defined as a difference between the test scores of the White students and other ethnic minorities. Very subtle and maybe not so subtle that the achievement gap, re, got redefined though(ph). And so, now we are focused in on this NAPE gap, gap in a, in, in NAPE reading the mass scores between Latinos and Black students and White students. And the nation is no longer focused on what was the original achievement gap and the promises that we made. But the original one is very instructive because when you look at the, when I was interested, when I looked at the same, same, same ah, test scores, I came away with a very different impression. One of things that were some, that, that, that was a lesson to me was to look at the scores of white students. And from 1970 to 2000, the line is flat on NAPE reading, on NAPE test. On SAT, it declines from 1970 to 2000. And on international test, there has been no demonstrable progress. Now, I'm looking at that thinking, the students in suburbia with the best schools and the most resources, the most experienced teachers, what teaches a more likely to be teaching in subjects that they're certified and higher paid and better phy, physical plans and that been, there has been no demonstrable increase in achievement over a 30-year period. That's the state of American education. So, then I asked, so what do we expect? The students in the least favored schools with more inexperienced teachers, with fewer resources, would actually make even more progress than those in the most favored situations. Well, in fact they did. I mean, the only significant achievement gains we got in the three decades from 1970 to 2000 were the significant advances by Latino and African- American students in the whole country. But that is not in the popular medium. No Americans know that these were the only significant achievement gains made in the country, that everybody else either remain flat or they decline, though(ph). Now, yes there was a decline late '80s to early '90s but when you looked at the NAPE scores in 2003, it was interesting because Latino and African-American fourth graders, not only made enormous progress across the country but is very different this time, white scores increase but their scores increase faster, so the progress they made in 2003, suggest even more significant progress. Now, (clears throat) these schools and teachers in America may not sustain their progress to the point that their 17-year-old. But one point is very clear, if these fourth graders are making such important progress in 2003, then does that not reflect the home culture? Is it possible for them to make that progress without a support of home culture? Did they rebel against their home culture to make that progress? No. I don't think you can blame it on the home culture. And, but I think that's one of the things that we wanna talk about, uhm, as we look at this, at this question. Now, (clears throat) I wanna shift to culture because I think there are couple of things happening in American education that speaks to a continuing debate on the relevance of culture. I've heard the emphasis on culture at the conference and I wanna talk about the countervailing emphasis on culture, the counter movement that we will all have to deal with. It hasn't been since (inaudible ) in 19, ah, I think the (inaudible ) was 1966, 1965 where there's been an insult and an attack on African-American culture in a way that we're seeing today. And it may extend to other racial and ethnic minority groups, okay. And what I mean is that, people have now blamed the achievement gap on African-American culture. And they're using that to shift arguments away from segregation, away from inequality. And away from the distribution of resources and opportunity to learn. To blame in the victims for the lack of achievement, of achievement. And, in some ways it, it bothers me because it's more in, insidious, more ah, ah, uhm, and, and, and, and more insulting than it's ever been, ah, and there's something that has happened in America that I'm paying attention to that is gonna be quite volatile if it continues in this direction (clears throat). And what has happened is that, people are now saying that not all Black students in America have family culture problems and not all Black students in America have learning problems, that is only African-Americans who have those problems. So, they're starting to make distinctions between Black students who are children of African immigrants or African residents and Black children who are West Indian versus those who are African-Americans. Now, (clears throat) one of the persons who's doing that, of course, is John McWhorter from Berkeley who wrote a book called "Losing the Race." (clears throat) And this is the following quote from his book. He's a Professor of Linguistics at Berkeley. He makes a point of saying, "Every Black undergraduate I have taught, who has been one of the best students in my class, has been of Caribbean extraction." Okay, that's very poignant, okay. Ah, unless we should miss the intend to target, the underscores the point, "It's not being Black in America alone that creates a friction with school, it is Black-American culture specifically, that's the problem." In the recent article, I don't know if you read the Chronicle of Higher Education, it was by an African-American, and McWhorter is also African-American, ah, Professor Phillip Richards, whose at Colgate, ah, I believe. And the title of the article had kind of inflammatory title, "Prestigious Colleges Ignore the Inadequate Intellectual Achievement of Black Students." And in this article he makes the following ah, ah, pronouncement, quote: With the exception of a few high performance, often women from West Indies or Africa, most Black students do not achieve academic distinction. Again, separated West Indian and African students from African-Americans saying that the problem of family culture is specifically an African-American. Now, they do this in a fairly manufactured and trumped up way, by arguing something as crazy as the notion of an anti-intellectual ethic that originated in slavery, that has been unchanged and fixed over, nearly 400 years and that African-American families still suffer from this set of values that are anti-intellectual. Ah, and there are number of ah, ah, ah, of scholars arguing that. And the same thing we get is from, uhm, ah, the Thernstrom an annual book because when they are looking at students who have exactly the same social indicators and sometimes the same patterns of achievement, they still argue that one has class or immigration but for African-American students, it's always a matter of their family culture. And, ah, and, and, and her chapter ah, her section on this and, ah, or their section, the Thernstrom, is called Culture Matters. They make the following statement, place it, they're looking at African-American and Hispanic students. And they say, "Hispanics, typically, lie(ph) too but their case has much to do with the group profile, strongly influenced by the continuing influx of migrant children from uneducated homes. The difficulties of African-American children's group seem more deeply rooted and harder to remedy." So, we're getting now a scholarship which says that African-American students have a family culture that is so anti-intellectual and so the values culture, I mean the learning, the culture of learning, that there's almost no possible way to remedy this they say. And my own, ah, ah, sort of summation of this is to follow an a, an article that I wanna write is, is that, intractable culture pathology is the next best thing to skin color racism because either way and sometimes is actually ah, is, is harder to overcome, 'coz even a biologist entertain the notion of a mutation, right? 

00:32:45
 Hmm. 

00:32:45
JAMES ANDERSON  But with intractable culture pathology, you can't get out of it. And I used to wonder why was everybody rushing to Shaker Heights to study African-American kids. I couldn't figure that out because it was like, when does Shaker Heights become the Mecca... (crosstalk) 

00:33:05
 (Laughing) 

00:33:05
JAMES ANDERSON ...of African-American culture. You know, and the Thernstrom was in Shaker Heights and John McWhorter was in Shaker Heights and 'course the late Abu(ph) was in Shaker Heights and everybody was there studying the, you know, Harlem maybe. The Delta Mississippi maybe, even the low lands(ph) maybe, ah, Oak, Oakland for that matter. 

00:33:20
 (Laughing) 

00:33:20
JAMES ANDERSON  But not Shaker Heights. And, finally, I realized that they had identified a population, a middle class African-American students who without doing well on the test scores, which enable them to say, "You see it's not a matter of class. It's a racial culture. Even middle-class Black students devalue learning and have the same attitudes toward learning the self-improvement as working class African-American students." And the Thernstrom say, specifically that it, the culture follow racial lines, not class lines. And so, they're now conflated race with culture in a way that culture functions the same way as race, as racism. And that they note that culture, it, is a, is a culturally-coded racism, that's be in put in the place. Now, does this fit with anything that we know, in American scholarship? No, it does not. I mean, is not, is so, we haven't studied African-American culture. I mean, we look at the scholarship over the past three decades. African-American culture has been dissected like a frog in a science lab. 

00:34:35
 (Laughing) 

00:34:35
JAMES ANDERSON  There are books about African-American human, religion, music, family values, every aspect of a culture has been studied. What is amazing is the renaissance of American history that took place about 1970, was focused almost entirely on a study of African-American culture. Almost every book award went to someone like Herbert Gutman who write on the Black family, Lawrence Levine, write on the Black culture, Black consciousness or Michael Sobel(ph) write on Black religion. As these all this work that's done out there not to mention all the work that's done, specifically on the history of African-American education that pay particular attention to the cultural norms and the values of education in the African-American community. What amazes me and that in reading the footnotes of McWhorter, of the Thernstroms, of Thomas Sowell, of Laurence Steinberg, and of other and so forth and so on, not one piece of that scholarship is cited, not one piece. It's just completely ignored as though it doesn't exist and then people perceive to const, construct understandings and notions and explanations without even having to reckon with that. And that can create a lot of blindness for teachers, for employers and for others in society. And I just wanna comment on that before I then, concluded and, and, and get questions (inaudible ). What I wanna us, want to, to, to talk about my own sort of understanding of this and how I ended this with blindness. (Clears throat). When I was writing a book on the history of African-American education, one of the things that did not occur to me to write about was the values and norms of education in the African-American community. It is something that I had grown up, you know, within Alabama, and I knew on individual level that it was not something that I thought to write about. So, I'm sitting in the Fisk University Archives, where there's this all kinds of information about African-American in the school and I see, for the first time, a contract for the building of the school in the town in Alabama it is called the Rosenwald School. And I knew about the Rosenwald Schools, I thought they were schools that were donated by the Rosenwald Foundation out of Chicago in order to help African-Americans have access to schools with southern states and southern localities refuse to build that. And so I thought, "Oh, this is interesting and I just sort of tossed it aside." Then I saw another one, and finally I took a look at that and I, I, I saw that that they had this legend of the money that was donated to build the school and says that Rosenwald Fund contributed like $5000. The local district contributed like $6000. The African-American community contribute $10,000. And I thought that that's an interesting footnote to history, okay. And so I tossed that aside and these are different trips there. So now, on my third trip to the archive and I remember I asked the archivist, "Is there a box that's packed the things that, you know, that we just haven't looked?" She said, "Yes." And so she brings out these boxes and there are 5,000 at least contracts. Five thousand covering two-thirds of the counties in the southern states. I mean the 18 states that legally mandate the segregation. And each one of these contracts document the money that was paid by African-Americans. So I'm looking at all of these and say, "Wait a minute." You know, so as I begin to tabulate these and this is in the 1920's and 1930's and it comes over five million dollars that's raised in cash-poor communities, in communities where the average African-American family only made $300 a year. And all these money has been raised to build schools because the local communities and the states will not build them. First thing that clicked me was, "Wait a minute. If this are 5,000 schools across 18 states, in over, little be over a thousand counties, how is that possible?" How is it possible that African-Americans in Louisiana, in North Carolina, in Mississippi, Alabama, in Missouri, and all these places have behaved in the exactly the same way and thinking the same way and for the first time, I recognize what a cultural value really is, okay. Because how else could you explain that? They're independent of each other. They're not working together and yet has happened in the same way and so then I begun to focus, you know, just what do we mean by a cultural value, how do we document the existence of a cultural value? When is it pervasive? When it is anecdotal? When is it an exception? How do we know that? And to me, I thought, "This is almost like being in church where it doesn't matter whether you're in Louisiana or Mississippi or New York." You're clapping to the same beat, right? Which makes it a cultural phenomenon. Well, it's the same way with schooling but then what was really persuasive for me; it wasn't just the existence of the contracts. All these agents of the Rosenwald Foundation, most of them White had compiled this boxes of stories that they had written about the dedication of African-American families and African-American communities to education. And that they were tucked away in the boxes. Now, I knew that many of these same agents had written articles in newspapers, in magazines and some even books and autobiographies and nowhere in the public record had they ever mentioned that. They had never talked about this and yet, in their own private memoirs, they were saying things like, "We have never seen such dedication to education, anywhere at any time." And they have these stories in there that I thought that I, and some of them are used about being in places where African-Americans only had pennies and nickels and people donated everything they had to build a school. And then the other thing that we couldn't write, which I discovered, was that all those schools, in most cases, were built on land donated by African-American landowners. Because the southern states and the southern localities, even when you got the money to build a school, would not buy the land for the school. And so, and then they had a deed to contract over to the states, so there was this massive transfer of land from African-American landowners to southern states... (crosstalk)

00:41:55
JAMES ANDERSON ...as sites for public schools, for African-American kids. And as they start to go through this more and more, I'm started thinking, "I live in a society that tells me that African-Americans don't value education." So how am I suppose to explain this? And now, I'm listening to scholars who said, "Historically, they haven't value their education." That the anti-intellectualism that McWhorter writes about or the opposition of culture, all developed long ago and it's still with African-Americans and it self-perpetuated through African-American families... (crosstalk) 

00:42:25
 (Coughs) 

00:42:25
JAMES ANDERSON  and that's the real problem we have in American education. What I wanna say to teachers and educators is, that "That's not the problem that we have." If there's anything that you have to work with, if there's anything that you have to build though, it's the value of education... (crosstalk) 

00:42:45
 (Coughs) 

00:42:45
JAMES ANDERSON ...in African-American families. That's about the only thing... (crosstalk) 

00:42:50
 (Coughs) 

00:42:50
JAMES ANDERSON ...that you really have to work with in some ways. And ah, and, and, and, and, and, and as a child growing up, I mean I was taught that Utah and Alabama would be the Mecca of African-American culture. If you really want to study African-American culture, I mean, we haven't moved in the last, what, 300 years. You know, I mean, families, communities and so forth have stayed in there and so why not go then study the value of African-American culture and so forth. But the point I want to make is growing up. You see, all these people just always buzzing you... (crosstalk) 

00:43:20
 (Coughs) 

00:43:20
JAMES ANDERSON ...about going to school and getting education. And my grandmother did not have an education. She was totally illiterate, never been in school in her life and she was the worse in terms, ah, "You cannot miss a day at school." (crosstalk) 

00:43:30
 (Coughs) 

00:43:30
JAMES ANDERSON  "You cannot miss a day." And then she would repeat what almost every grandmother will say to an African-American child, "You gotta get education 'cause it's the one thing, (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
 (Coughs) 

00:43:40
JAMES ANDERSON the one thing that nobody can take from you." You know, and that is the kind of support that you have in African-American families. What they're trying to do is to convince teachers and educators that African-American family culture is the main obstacle to academic achievement on the part of African-American kids. (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
 (Coughs) 

00:44:00
JAMES ANDERSON And so, anyone who is interested in the relevance of culture to their educational process is gonna have to engage to this, because this fight is not about to subside and it's about to get worse. And what really is gonna get worse is that they're now starting to be very, very pointed in their attack upon, not Black kids but African-American kids in particular. And so, I think we need to, to, to, to begin to address that and to think about how we gonna deal with that in the future. Let me conclude it by saying, that as we move forward (clears throat) beyond Brown's 50th anniversary, that's the time for the country to reflect and come to grasp one with the strong cultural norms and institutional practices that favors segregation. Ah, we, as a nation, prefer segregation. We just need to, to admit that. What I mean by that, if we could start all over again, and that was complete freedom of choice, and you'd say, "Okay, just choose schools and communities the way you want them without any obstacles," we'll end up segregated. Those, those are choices that we make and it shows up in so many ways. I was discussing with some friends ah, some studies that I use now. Uhm, wherever we turn, we see these preferences. And one of them that I have a lot of fun with is that uhm, and that I use in class, in a town lives this(ph) Emily and Brandon have a better chance for employment than Keisha and Jamal. And it's a study that was done by University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. And in Chicago, they send out these surveys and they send these CVs and resumes to the employees that were looking for workers. And they made them up, you know, Keisha, Jamal, BA from Harvard and gave all these credentials. And then they waited on the response for a week and what they got was that there was a significant low response to Keisha and Jamal than to Brandon and Emily. And people didn't know who they were because these folks were not real; they were just names on the CV. Then they start to tweak the CVs by giving Jamal and Keisha better credentials to see what the response is. And when they picked them was that, in America today, even something like a name becomes a cultural code for race and employers don't respond... (crosstalk) 

00:46:30
 (Clears throat) 

00:46:30
JAMES ANDERSON ...because the assumption is that Keisha and Jamal are Black and Brandon and Emily are White. Those are the kind of preferences that we make. Those are the kind of choices that we make ah, in, in the society. And that's what we will continue to, to deal with in, in, in the 21st century. Ah, and 'coz I, I have a lot of fun with my cla, with my class because my generation, we were name James and Peter and John... (crosstalk) 

00:46:50
 (inaudible ) 

00:46:54
JAMES ANDERSON  and I said, "You know, we gotta get to door before sometime for they'll realized we're Black," and said, "No." But you want to get a call for interview, (crosstalk) 

00:47:00
 (Laughing) 

00:47:00
JAMES ANDERSON so I give them suggestions, I said, "Your name is something like Aeisha whatever. Just go A.K. Johnson. 

00:47:05
 (Laughing) 

00:47:05
JAMES ANDERSON  Put that on your CV and see if you're still had the chance. But if you go there as Aeisha, ah, (laughs) you'll not gonna get a call back." (Laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
 (Laughing) 

00:47:15
JAMES ANDERSON My point is that, you know, (laughs) it, that is funny but it tells us the kind of society that we live in and the kind of choices that we make. And don't forget, William Julius Wilson who actually did the book, "The Declining Significance of Race" in which he thought that in the future, ah, particularly in the immediate future, ah, that the opportunities and chances for learning for ah, achievement as well as for employment in American society, particularly for African-Americans, will be determined more by class and by race. And people remembered that study. He was given American Sociological Association Outstanding Book Award for that study. But there's another study that, that Wilson did later on and he published the results in Chicago Magazine that nobody seems to talk that much about. And he went to the Chicago employees and asked them about whether race matter and who they hire. And what they told him that they didn't wanna hire African-Americans no matter how qualified they were. And it caused Wilson to really change his mind about "The Declining Significance of Race in America." Ah, and, and, and, and, and I think that it is, is, is where we are today. I'll stop here and see if you have comments or questions and then ah, we'll take them. One more thing that I do wanna say that, you know, I've used African-American examples on Brown v. Board of Education because that's my area of research. One of the things that we do in our conference, and I hope will not be lost on all of us is that, the struggle for Brown both to get there and beyond is a multi-ethnics struggle. When you look at the case, it turns out that the five cases before the Supreme Court in 1954, from Kansas, from Delaware, in Washington D.C., in South Carolina, uhm, ah, and, and Virginia were cases, all cases involved an African-American plaintiffs. But that was just an accident of time and the cases that happened to be before the court at that time. When you look at the movement toward Brown and look at the names of those cases Gong Lum v. Rice is the case... (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
 (Coughs) 

00:49:20
JAMES ANDERSON ...from the Chinese out of the Delta, Mississippi fighting to end segregation of Chinese-American kids in schools in Mississippi. Mendez v. California, Delgado v. California, those cases from Mexican-American communities were part... (crosstalk) 

00:49:40
 (Coughs) 

00:49:40
JAMES ANDERSON ...of the struggle to get to Brown. It was always a multi-ethnic struggle. Beyond Brown, if you look at the cases Lau v. Nichols, Rodriguez case versus San Antonio, you know, which is one of, which is probably the most important case, I think, in the post-Brown era because what is saying in Rodriguez v. San Antonio was that, "If you're born in the property poor district and you get a poor education, you have no right to redress in the U.S. constitution." And I think that is a really significant case and that is one that has to be challenged to say, "An accident, a birth, and a property poor district should not relegate a child to the inferior education and that the State have an obligation on the equal protection clause to equalize fund in the public schools." And we still have to fight that battle. And so it's only when we engage in the multi-ethnic understanding of the Brown v. Board of Education do we really appreciate all the issues of bilingualism, of disability, of, of, of, of ah, of funding and so forth and, and, and I didn't want to, to for you to, to, to not get that because my examples are mostly on my own research which tends to focus on the history of African-American education. Thank you very much.

00:50:50
  Well, I feel like I was back in (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:51:05
 (Laughing) 

00:51:05
 Uhm, I think we should probably pick one to four questions, uhm, fortunately, (crosstalk) 

00:51:10
 (Coughs) 

00:51:10
 ...would be followed by two hours (inaudible ) so what I think we have little time to take a couple of questions here for Dr. Anderson. Uhm, closer. 

00:51:20
 Good morning, Doctor. Can you hear me?(crosstalk) 

00:51:25
JAMES ANDERSON Hmm. You wanna use microphone? 

00:51:25
 No. (inaudible ). Uhm, I guess my question is that I was a student in the '80s when the decision, one of the decisions was made to change ah, the reading programs... (crosstalk) 

00:51:35
JAMES ANDERSON Uh hmm. 

00:51:35
 ...that had been positive especially for African-American schools like (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:51:39
JAMES ANDERSON  Uh hmm. 

00:51:40
 ...and it was switched to whole language...(crosstalk) 

00:51:40
JAMES ANDERSON Uh hmm. 

00:51:40
 ...and it was, as, I personally see a, a relationship between that and the decline in reading and once again we have switched back to (inaudible ). But I guess one of my question is, do you see a relationship between that and the widening? Now, I know you define that at one point, it was the gap score and now it's the Black-White, you know, gap. 

00:51:55
JAMES ANDERSON Uh hmm. 

00:51:55
  Do you see a relationship between them and what the basis in, in changing the basics and you know, the Black-White gap increasing or decreasing? 

00:52:05
JAMES ANDERSON I really don't know and I, in fact, as it, one of the things I do know is no one really explained that decline, uhm, in part because the decline is short lived in some ways. And when you look at, ah, a, almost five-year or ten-year decline ah, in a period of over 170 years or so or 130 years, ah, it's very difficult to know why a decline occur ah, at that particular point in time. I do know there is no justification to take the same culture that was responsible for the increases of 130 years and then turn that culture or blame that culture for the decline in that five-year period. Ah, you know, for people who, ah, who in pedagogy in curriculum, ah, they might have one answer. I mean, I really think that the largest social forces which we call "Regonomics(ph)" ah, which resulted in a dramatic decrease of labor force participation by African-Americans ah, had an impact on that. And as one thing that, you know, sometimes people will make the comparison, ah, you had all kinds of problems in the '80s but you also had a decline in the work force in Detroit automobile industry, a lot of Whites were out of the jobs. And one of the first things they did when they study Whites, who lost their jobs in automobile ind, in, industry, was the impact on their kids who achievements schools decline, okay? Well, no one looks at the decline of labor force participation by African- Americans and what impact it has on their kids. And what the researches really discovered was that the amount of uncertainty and the amount of instability actually did translate into lower school performance. And so there are a lot of things to look at, you gotta look at those social forces and you also gonna look changes in pedagogy in curriculum all and I suspect it's gonna be a confluences in circumstances that account for it. 

00:53:55
  Claude Steele's notion of stereotype threat... (crosstalk) 

00:54:05
JAMES ANDERSON Uh hmm. 

00:54:05
 ...where does that fit into your analysis of this constructive intractable cultural pathology... (crosstalk) 

00:54:10
JAMES ANDERSON Yes. 

00:54:10
 ...or it doesn't? 

00:54:10
JAMES ANDERSON  Yes, it does fit in. In fact, ah, actually in that paper with a discussion of Claude Steel's work because uhm, what I found amazing about Claude Steel's work is that populations that have been in our society, the most favorite, and very confident can also exhibit stereotype threat. When you took White students and put them in situations whether it was stereotype threat, their performance also went down. And my view is that if it can happen to them, in a society which has a firm, ah, they value their intellectual worth over very long time, what must it be like for students that hear that kinds of comments that have been made about, about them and their families, that they don't value education, that they fight ah, that they listen to rap music, that they are anti-intellectual, that they can't perform well. You see, there's a lot of way to say you're dumb but it all comes out to the same. And what happens to kids that always hear from the popular media, ah, from pundits ah, and, and, and in many cases, from teachers that they are dumb. I think Claude Wel, Claude Steel has a very, is working very critical here 'coz for the first time, he documents what that impact is.
