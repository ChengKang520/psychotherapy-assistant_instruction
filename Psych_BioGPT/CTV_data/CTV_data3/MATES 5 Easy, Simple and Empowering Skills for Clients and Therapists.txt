MATES: 5 Easy, Simple and Empowering Skills for Clients and Therapists By Dr Roby Abeles 

00:00:20
DR. ROBY ABELES We're going to start with a full run through of what we call the five MATES keys. So, we're going to do some, um, obviously, some PowerPoint. We're gonna do a little demonstrations between Salene to sorta show you some concepts a little bit between the two of us to help you integrate those. Um... and then, we w-wanting to, if possible, save questions till the end 'cuz it's only 90 minutes. And, um... We've really tried 'cuz it's normally a two day training for mental health professionals. So, we want you to have two days' worth in 90 minutes. So, we've done our best to pick bits out. So, um, and you know how it is, if you know a concept really wells, we might leave something that you have questions about. So, if we leave those to the end, um, that's probably a better way to go about it than asking questions throughout. Is that okay with everybody? All right? So if you just make notes if you have questions... So we're gonna start with, um, the four MATES practice. So in your therapy room with your clients or in your personal life, these five MATES keys are good for you to do in just your life generally and with your family and kids, um, and to do in therapy room with your clients. Um, so... MATES is a resourcing program. It's not a therapy. So we thought we'd just start with doing some resourcing so you could have a more embodied feeling of what it's like. So you can even just have a sense of how you're feeling right now... and then, you can sorta check that against how you're gonna feel at the end. It's only gonna take like a minute or two. So it's not a big, long thing. So you can stay seated to do it. You can stand to do it. If you like a little room to stretch, there'll be some stretching. So if you like a little room, you can stand. But with clients and with yourself, we've developed it so it can be done anywhere and in any position. So the clients who get triggered on a bus, if they get too anxious, they can do it on a bus, they can do it anywhere. So that's how it's developed. So you could just play with that as well. So if the MATES, M-A-T-E-S, um... Can you work the slides as well? Oh. So the MATES, um, acronym stands for Mind, Air, Tree, Express, and Stretch, which we'll have slides on that later. So before this practice now, the first one's going to be a mind exercise, which is how to find a helpful thought, which you'd find with your client, one on one. But just for this practice and one that works well for a lot of clients is, "I'm okay right now." So as we go through this little MATES practice, if you all just, when I ask you to repeat your helpful thought in your mind, if you'd just think, "I'm okay right now," just as sort of the default little helpful thought. So, here we go! So... 

00:03:15
SALENE SOUZA I missed your thing. Sorry, I missed your thought. (laughing) Sorry. 

00:03:20
DR. ROBY ABELES So it's gonna be... 

00:03:20
SALENE SOUZA Just to clear my head to be here for you. 

00:03:20
DR. ROBY ABELES So Salene's gonna do it. I'm gonna talk you through it and Salene's gonna do it for you. 

00:03:25
SALENE SOUZA I'm your model. 

00:03:25
[laughter] 

00:03:25
DR. ROBY ABELES Yes. This is... (laughs) this is what we prepared earlier. (laughs) So... 

00:03:30
[laughter] 

00:03:30
Mind Exercise: "I'm OK Right Now" 

00:03:30
DR. ROBY ABELES All right. So in your mind now - and you can keep your eyes open or closed, whatever you would like to do... So in your mind, think about your helpful thought. "I'm okay right now." 

00:03:45
[sil.] 

00:03:50
DR. ROBY ABELES And now repeat that in your mind three times. 

00:03:55
[sil.] 

00:04:00
DR. ROBY ABELES And breathe some air in... and breathe some air out. And notice the air moving easily in and out as you take a few breaths. 

00:04:20
[sil.] 

00:04:25
DR. ROBY ABELES And now... imagine that you are a tree and feel your feet connected to the ground. Feel supported by the earth, strong and solid like a tree. 

00:04:45
[sil.] 

00:04:50
DR. ROBY ABELES And now, you can express in a word in your mind how you're feeling right now. So you might be feeling little bit stressed, calmer, just okay. 

00:05:05
[sil.] 

00:05:15
DR. ROBY ABELES And now, stretch your neck slowly and look around the room. 

00:05:20
[sil.] 

00:05:30
DR. ROBY ABELES And stretch your arms slowly as though you are reaching for the sky. 

00:05:40
[sil.] 

00:05:45
DR. ROBY ABELES And stretch your upper body slowly as though you are dancing. 

00:05:50
[sil.] 

00:05:55
DR. ROBY ABELES And now, stretch your hips slowly as though you are playing with a hula hoop. One way... and then, the other way. Very good. Now, stretch your legs slowly as though you're riding a bicycle... under the table. 

00:06:15
SALENE SOUZA (laughs) 

00:06:20
DR. ROBY ABELES And now stretch one of your ankles as though you're kicking a ball. 

00:06:25
[sil.] 

00:06:25
[laughter] 

00:06:30
DR. ROBY ABELES Salene's from Brazil so she's very good at soccer. So... (laughs) and the other ankle as though you're kicking a ball. And now stretch your whole body as though you're waking up from a nice nap. Okay. So... did any of you notice any change from when you started and now? And just a little bit of, like, what, what is the difference that you noticed? 

00:07:05
UNKNOWN Being more alert? 

00:07:05
DR. ROBY ABELES More alert? Okay, good. And anything else? 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN Feeling more positive and... 

00:07:10
DR. ROBY ABELES More positive? Excellent. And anyone else? 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN More relaxed. 

00:07:15
DR. ROBY ABELES More relaxed? Okay. So those are the three perfect things... 

00:07:20
[laughter] 

00:07:20
Why MATES was developed • As a parenting program for people who had multiple diagnoses, chronic mental health and domestic violence and addiction issues • Most with complex PTSD and personality disorders 

00:07:20
DR. ROBY ABELES It's as though we have given you cue cards. Because... (laughs) that's what it will do with your clients. For the people who are a little sleepy or low energy, it makes them more alert. For the people who had a bit of high energy, it makes them more relaxed. So, and you know, and in between. So, it, it seems to, what it does is fill the gap of whatever the person needs at that moment. All right? So we'll move on. So we wanted to tell you, um, why MATES was developed. So it was originally developed as a parenting program for people who had multiple diagnoses, chronic mental health issues, domestic violence, and addiction issues, and were, at the time, currently looking at homelessness or in and out of a homeless sort of situation. So, um... Most of the clients we developed it for had complex P.T.S.D. and severe personality disorder. So, uh... Do any of you work with those sorts of clients on a regula-,...? Yeah. So you'll love this. 

00:08:20
[laughter] 

00:08:20
How MATES was developed • Dr Roby Abeles and Salene Souza created MATES by defining and simplifying all the skills and training that had worked most effectively with hundreds of their complex needs clients, and simplifying it all again and again down to its essence so that it would be available to everyone • This included knowledge and experience taken from a combined 35 years of advanced training, studying with leaders in the fields of EMDR, Somatic Experiencing, Neuroscience, Ego State work, Gestalt, Psycho Drama & Brainspotting. 

00:08:25
DR. ROBY ABELES (laughing) All right. So, um... Salene and I created MATES by... Well, together, we have 35 years of working with this population. So we wanted to develop something that, um, would help people. We did it by defining and simplifying all the skills and training that we had had over all those years. We traveled, um, overseas a couple times every year to take trainings in other countries, sort of cutting edge technologies and keeping up with what the brain science is now. So we've developed that, we used all that with our clients and we've worked with, um, hundreds of complex needs clients, simplifying these, these concepts down again and again, down to their essence so they could be understood by everyone. So, as you know, like, there, there are theories out there that are quite complicated and even with a degree in studying, they're really hard to grasp what people are talking about. So we developed MATES so that even a four or five year old could understand it and then, turn around and explain it to another four or five year old. So that's what it is. And we have found that with little kids, that's exactly what they do. They learn it and then they go find another kid to teach it to or remind their parents. "Remember we could do this thing? Let's do it together, Mummy." (laughs) It's quite amazing. So, um... Yeah, it's 35 yeras of advanced training we've had, um, studying with leaders in the fields of E.M.D.R. Any E.M.D.R. therapists here? Yeah. So you can weave this into E.M.D.R. processing. Um, somatic experiencing or somatic psychotherapy - does anyone here do somatic psychotherapy? So... (laughs) Yeah, 'cuz they go together so beautifully. 

00:10:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible) 

00:10:00
What problems are mental health professionals experiencing today? • Clients with complex and multiple diagnoses and high needs are coming to our offices and agencies more and more. • Lack of basic training in trauma counseling and psychotherapy course work. • Little extra time or the funding to get training • Time taken for training puts you behind in your work and adds to stress 

00:10:00
What is the solution to this problem? • MATES. Why? Because we need a simple training to cover the most important, current and updated knowledge and skills in the field. "In order to help inappropriate fight/flight/freeze responses to come to an end, you need to work with people's bodily responses. You need to help their body to feel like it's over." - Bessel van der Kolk, MD MATES 

00:10:00
How is MATES different from other 'stress management' programs? The MATES program takes into consideration: • Clients who have complex therapy needs and are considered trauma survivors • Clients who tend to be easily triggered into fight-flight-freeze responses • Clients who have multiple diagnoses • That skills are easy and quick to learn for all ages, even those with different language and cultural backgrounds • Clients who may believe there is no help for them and change is not possible • Traumatized people tend to have difficulty taking in new information • Traumatized people tend to have limited attention spans • When people are trigged into fight-flight-freeze they need a simple way to remember the skills they have learned, so we developed the MATES bracelet to remind them. MATES 

00:10:00
DR. ROBY ABELES Yes. Um, and neuroscience, ego state work, gestalt, psycho drama, and brainspotting. So, um... It's a combination of all of that - the best bits of all of that. Um... Okay, so... What problems are mental health professionals dealing with today? Um, so... I think we're getting more and more complex clients. Would you agree with that? Yeah. So, whereas we used to maybe be able to get people who were just having like a single inc-, um, incident of grief or a single car accident, we've now got, um... We've got, we've now got people who have more and more trauma in their history who have, um, more and more, um, trauma and are less and less capable of staying present with whatever process you're doing with them in your office, would you say you're finding that? So that's another way you can use MATES, is for those clients to help them be more present in the moment so you can do whatever therapy you're trained to do with them. Um, so the... Another problem that mental health professionals have is that training costs a lot of money and it takes time out from your practice and then you get behind in everything else. So we wanted to develop something that you could learn quickly and put into practice immediately. So that's also what MATES does. Um... We don't want you to have to travel the world twice a year to get all this so we just condensed it down and give it to you simply. So, um... You also have to get funding. A lot of people work in agencies where the agency doesn't have a lot of money for training. Um, and... The training puts you behind in your work, which adds to your stress, which is no good for your clients or you or your family. All right. So, um... What is the solution to the mo-, problem? So, it's MATES. 'Cuz we need a simple training to cover the most important, current, and updated skills in the field. So here's a quote from Bessel van der Kolk. So, you're probably... Most of you familiar with Bessel van der Kolk's work? Um... "In order to help inappropriate fight-flight-freeze respa-, responses to come to an end, you need to work with people's bodily responses. You need to help their body to feel like it's over." So, um... MATES as it's experienced is a very body-focused little series of keys. So it does help for your people to come to the present moment quite quickly. Um... Okay! So, next slide. So, how is MATES different from other stress management programs? Um... So we have taken into consideration clients who have complex thir-, therapy needs and are considered trauma survivors. So, even if people are coming and they have, you know, addiction issues or other issues, I think most of us have found by now that it-, there's severe trauma in their history. And these are just symptoms of the unresolved trauma, mostly from childhood. Um... So we've taken that into consideration as well. Um... We developed it for clients who have, are very easily triggered into fight-flight-freeze responses so that, um, in the office, there could just be a color in your office that triggers them or temperature of the room that triggers them. So we're working with people who are constantly triggered in the moment. So we, um, developed MATES for those people to help them come back to, to identify that quickly and come back from it quickly. Um, 'cuz a lot of these clients don't even know they get triggered, it's just such a normal part of their lives so it also trains them on the fact that they're getting triggered and they'll be able to identify that. Um, so it's... We developed it for clients who have multiple diagnoses and I think, you know, by the time people come to Salene and I, they've usually got, you know, a dozen or more diagnoses in their history. So, we wanted a model that was de-pathologizing as well. Um, the skills are easy and quick to learn for all ages, even those with different language and cultural backgrounds. So, we've taught MATES to groups of parents from a variety of different cultural backgrounds, some with very limited English capability and they're all able to understand it and put it into practice. Um... We also took into consideration clients who may believe there is no help for them and that change is not possible. So, I think by the time a lot of clients come to us as well, um, nothing has worked. And they're just in a spiral of despair, either with themselves or their children or the whole situation. So, with MATES they can start to see very quickly that things can change, as you can see. In a minute and a half or two minutes, something can start to change. Um... We also had to take into account that traumatized people have difficulty taking in new information. So, because the frontal lobe gets shut down when they go into the fight-flight-freeze. So we had to, um... So we developed, um, a bracelet, which has the, which has the acronym on it and the words for what that is. So we tell them it's a cheat sheet and they can take it with them wherever they are. And it's also a nice little transitional object back to you in that office where they can feel safe and contained. And we... You know, the colors we chose, we had to pu-, choose colors that were not triggering for people...

What is MATES? • MATES is a way to model and teach empowerment skills. • It is not a therapy. It is a set of Resourcing skills to be woven into therapy or used independently by clients and counsellors to self-regulate the nervous system • It is resourcing, grounding and containment skills using 5 simple strategies to help people regulate their nervous system. MATES 

00:15:20
MATES is an acronym that stands for 5 simple skills MIND AIR TREE EXPRESS STRETCH MATES 

00:15:20
How does MATES empower people? • Psycho-education helps quickly remove shame spirals which enables learning and provides instant reframing from pathology to innately resourced. • MATES puts simple skills in the client's hands from the first time they are taught. • MATES is cross-cultural, easy to learn and practical regardless of education level or age. • The more the clients practice MATES during and in-between sessions, the more they feel able to manage their own lives. MATES 

00:15:20
Why does MATES help people? • The skills cue the brain to turn off the survival response of fight-flight-freeze and return to adaptive self regulation. • Adaptive self regulation allows social engagement. • Social engagement allows connection with oneself and others to find safety and solutions. MATES 

00:15:20
DR. ROBY ABELES ...and that boys would wear, girls would wear, men would wear, women would wear... So we came up with green and gold, which is also, as you know, Australia's colors and Brazil's colors. So, it seems to work well for everyone. And we've had, you know, men in, you know, um, tradies wear them - they don't care. So all sorts of people had-, seem happy to wear that. And you'll all get one of those before you leave. Um, we've also, um, taken into account that traumatized people have very limited attention spans. So they can only take in soundbites, really, at any particular time and that's why we've made it fairly simple and quick little soundbites. So you don't have to teach it to them all at once so that you can just teach it one little bit at a time. And it works just as well. Um, yes, so that's the bracelet. So, what is MATES, exactly? It's a way to model and teach empowerment skills. So, I think also a lot of, uh, clients that come to us have become dependent on a system or workers to help them through things. And they gradually, as they get more diagnoses, they get more and more disempowered in the process. Would you say that's been your experience? Yeah. So we also wanted to make it a model that was empowering for people and put the skills in their hands and that they don't actually need us to be able to do these, immediately after being taught it. So, um... And we also... I didn't put that on the slide but it's also... I used to send clients to D.P.T. Did anyone do that? Is still probably doing that? But it takes so long! It's like... (laughs) Like where were you up to when you're doing the take on this? So, but this is, you know, within a, you know, half an hour, you can teach it to them and they can start taking it out into the world. So these were all sort of the multiple problems I think that therapists have, that we have that we wanted to overcome all of them in a simple little model. Um... It's not a therapy and we really wanna make that clear. It's not a therapy. It's to be woven into whatever therapy you're already doing. So it's a skill set. Um... It can be used independently by clients and counselors to self-regulate the nervous system. So the whole MATES program is formed to be able to regulate the nervous system, which is what's creating the dysregulation, which then becomes the diagnosis. Um, so we make it pretty simple for people. It's not that you're bipolar, addicted, whatever it is, your nervous system got dysregulated some time ago. You've been trying to regulate it yourself with these behaviors and chemicals and it's still dysregulated. And the answer is to have you use MATES frequently, which will help your system, your nervous system come back into regulation. Does that make sense to everyone? So it's really de-pathologizing for people and we've had people the-, um, parents and people we've taught it to who've been through the system for years and years say, "Oh my god, if only this could have been in my, you know, the domestic violence shelter. If only this could have been in my rehab. It's that simple. Why do people, why do therapists make it so complicated?" So, it, it's really well, um, embraced by clients as well. So, it's resourcing, grounding, and containment skills using just five simple strategies, which you've just done, to help people regulate their nervous system. So, this is the acronym... MATES: Mind, Air, Tree, Express, and Stretch. And that's what's on this bracelet. Okay... Thanks. So, how does MATES empower people? So, it's psycho-education but it's more light. So it can help quickly remove shame spirals, which, you know, I think the more pathologized you become in the system, the more ashamed you feel of your inability to cope. Um, it enables learning and provides instant reframing from pathology to innately resourced. So, what we tell people is your nervous system has dysregulated but it has the capacity to regulate, that in your physiology you have the answer and that... Like, I tell my clients, like training a puppy. When you throw a ball to a puppy, it will run after it and bring it back. So, your nervous system's like a puppy and we just have to give it, we just have to throw the ball often enough and it'll start regulating itself and understand. So, um... And people love that. And as I said, it puts simple skills in the client's hands from the first time they are taught. It's cross-cultural, easy to learn, and practical, regardless of education level or age. So I think we've sort of gone over that but we also... There are a lot of people who are illiterate, functionally illiterate. Or, you know, they have... English is not their first language. Um... They may have limited, um, cognitive capacity for many reasons. So we really had to make it really simple. So, um... We spent a lot of hours making it simple. (laughing) It's amazing how hard it is to make something simple. So that we, we have actually achieved it. So, the more clients practice MATES during and in between sessions, the more they feel able to manage their own lives. And they start coming to sessions telling you about other things they can do in the world that they couldn't do before. It's sort of, um... So... Why does it help people? So, what, what we know is the skills were specifically chosen to cue the brain to turn off the survival response of the fight-flight-freeze and return to adaptive self regulation. So, it's like when the fight-flight-freeze response gets turned on, there has to be cues from the external and internal environment to flick the switch off again. Does that make sense? 

00:21:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:21:25
What sorts of issues does MATES help? • MATES helps to manage issues resulting from short and long term stress and/or trauma. • This includes relational and developmental trauma, medical trauma and all types of abuse and neglect. • MATES also help people suffering from depression, anxiety, bipolar, addiction and medical issues, out of control anger and personality disorders, ADD/ADHD, etc. MATES 

00:21:25
DR. ROBY ABELES So... We have specifically developed all five of those key skills to do that. So, each one... So a nice helpful thought, a little bit of oxygen, some grounding, some expression connecting with someone else, and some stretching. 'Cuz moving the body can help, slow movement of the body can help you be more here now. So all of those was specifically thought up to cue the brain that you're safe in the moment now. That's the point of them. They seem, you know, just like lovely little things to do but they're actually very well thought out. Um... Then, when the brain comes back into adaptive self regulation, that allows social engagement. So, in the therapy session, if your client is too much in fight- flight-freeze, they actually can't socially engage with you. Do you-, have you noticed that? They're just not there. They disassociate. They're all... So the more they do MATES, the more they're in the room with you and the more they can actually connect and socially engage with you. So that's kind of like, you know, the Polyvagal stuff. So, um... Also, it-, their relationships with others, people, start to improve because they can start to be more engaged socially and their face starts to move more in an engaging way, expressive ways. If people are too in fight-flight-freeze, the face is also giving out certain cues to other people that they read and it's harder to connect back to them so they experience isolation. But if they're more here now, more regulated, their face... What turns back on is the ability for microexpression and for being able to mirror other people they're in connection with. Does that make sense? All right. So, and then social engagement allows connection with oneself and others to find safety and solutions. I was doing this last night with - not last night - the night before with a client and, um, and I said to her, "So, what are you noticing now?" And she goes, "I can see you better." And I said, "What do you mean by you can see me better?" And she says, "You seem more here." But of course she's more here. So, but she said, "You just seem more here somehow." So, you get those kinds of really lovely feedback from clients after they've done it. All right. So... What sorts of issues does MATES help? Again, we wanted MATES to help everything. We have small girls so we wanted to help everyone with everything. People told us we were crazy but we said, "No, no, we think we could do that." So, um... it helps people manage issues resulting from short and long-term stress and trauma. Um, it includes relation, which includes relational and developmental trauma, medical trauma, and all types of abuse and neglect. It also helps people suffering from depression, anxiety, bipolar, addiction and medical issues, out of control anger and personality disorders, A.D.D., A.D.H.D., et cetera. Oppositional defiant disorder with children. So, it really does help. Um, we have not yet found a single D.S.M. diagnosis that, uh, a more regulated nervous system doesn't help. And did that make sense, right? 

00:24:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:24:40
What is trauma? • "Any negative life event occurring in a state of relative helplessness--a car accident, the sudden death of a loved one, a frightening medical procedure, a significant experience of rejection-can produce the same neuro-physiological changes in the brain as combat, rape or abuse. What makes a negative life event traumatizing is not the literal life-threatening nature of the event, but rather 1) the degree of helplessness it engenders and 2) one's history of prior trauma." Robert Scaer, MD, The Precarious Present Published in Psychotherapy Networker, November/December, 2006.p 49-53, 67 • Trauma is perhaps the most avoided, ignored, belittled, denied, misunderstood, and untreated cause of human suffering. Peter Levine, Developer of Somatic Experiencing MATES

Where is trauma? We experience trauma and healing on 5 levels of consciousness: - Mental - Emotional - Physical - Energetic - Spiritual MATES 

00:24:40
DR. ROBY ABELES Like, the more regulated you can be in your nervous system, the less you're acting out or acting in. 'Cuz you're more here now, which is when you can have access to the frontal lobe and find solutions and connect with people. Okay. So... What is trauma? So we thought we'd just do a little bit of what is trauma for people who may not have had any or enough, sort of, background in what trauma is. Because we think that's what is coming to every therapist, whether it's presented as a divorce, um, or empty nest syndrome, or, you know, grieving over something or a medical trauma or car accident, it's all, um, trauma. So, we found that if we treat the core, the symptoms tend to fall away. So, with my clients who have, um, addiction issues, we, I don't, we don't have to address the addiction issues straight up anymore. My early training, that's what we did. But now, I just tell people the more that you regulate and we resolve the trauma, the less you'll need these other supports. They're just, they're helping you. So... And the more they do MATES, the more they can have something... 'Cuz one of the other women that we taught this to said she was going to a drug and alcohol counselor weekly and she said that she was asked every week, uh, what-, how many drinks did you have this week? How many cigarettes did you have this week? And she said, "But she never told me anything I should be doing other than smoking cigarettes and drinking." And so, by the time she adopt, practice this for three weeks, she said she'd had three alcohol-free days. So, which is really without working on the drinking. So it's just helping her nervous system relax. And look, it's in their hands, they have to do it. But she said, "Thank god, so now I have an option." So, um... And she would do it over and over and over and over. That two little one and a half minute thing? She'd do it for two hours. So she was really committed 'cuz she had a little kid and but, she just kept doing it and in the end, she'd go, "You know what? I don't need it. I don't need to drink. I don't need another cigarette." So, it's amazing what a little nervous system regulation can do to help people feel more empowered and more in control of their lives. So, um... What is trauma? "Any life event - any negative life event - occurring in a state of relative helplessness." So, we used to say that it was a life-threatening thing, you know, in the D.S.M. It's not. You don't have to feel your life is threatened to be traumatized. Of course, that is part of it but it do-, it's not a necessary component. It's the feeling of helplessness during the event. Um... "A car accident, the sudden death of a loved one, a frightening medical procedure, or, we know now, a significant experience of rejection can produce the same neuro-physiological changes in the brain as combat, rape, or abuse. What makes a negative life event traumatizing is not the literal life-threatening nature of the event, but rather the degree of helplessness it engenders and one's history of prior trauma." So, is everyone finding that as well in your practice? Um... and that's from Robert Scaer. And trauma... And then, Peter Levine, at the bottom we've got a quote, who's the developer of somatic experiencing, um, has said, "Trauma is perhaps the most avoided, ignored, belittled, denied, misunderstood, and untreated cause of human suffering." So, I think once we can un-, um, accept that people have been traumatized in their abuse and neglect as children and that relational and developmental trauma is as severe as some of these other ones, then we can start to understand why people got so dysregulated, especially when they're young. It doesn't take a lot to dysregulate a small body. Um... All right. So... Oh, that's the slide. So, um... And where is trauma? Some people say trauma's in the event, right? No, trauma's not in the event. The event is the event. The trauma comes with you after the event. Right? So, this is also... We, with our clients, we ex-, we experience trauma and healing on five levels of consciousness: mental, emotional, physical, energetic, and spiritual. And all those five levels of consciousness need to be addressed for that event, the traumatic event, to be resolved within the body and mind and soul. Does that make sense to everybody? So that if you're only doing interventions that cover the mental-emotional level, the people will still need to do interventions on the physical, energetic, and spiritual. And you know, you don't have to learn everything. You can just refer out for the pieces that you're not trained in. But that we tell people... 'Cuz often people come to us and they've done a lot of C.B.T., a lot of emotional work, but they're still having relational problems, say. Um, so we go, "Okay, so have you done any physical?" You know, which the standing up makes you just do - that's part of working it into the physical body. And there are, you know, somatic psychotherapists who deal very much with the physical body and working it through. So, um... Energetically - so we're gonna talk a little bit more, uh, later about the energetic p-part of transmission of trauma and that we feel one another's nervous systems constantly. So that in the therapy room, energetically, you're working... If you're doing MATES on yourself in the therapy room and in your other life, then when you're in the therapy room with them, your nervous system becomes regulated and their nervous system scanning, constantly scanning the environment for a nervous system that's regulated, is gonna find your nervous system and be really happy. And then, they're gonna feel safe in the therapy room with you. And as we know, if they feel safe and connected, you can do amazing work in short periods of time. So... Using MATES on ourselves, Solane and I use MATES on ourselves all the time 'cuz you always... (laughs) Yeah... You always develop, you know, you teach what you need to learn so having dysregulated nervous systems ourselves, um, we've fo-, we also find this works well for us. And, um, particularly the more we do it in session with clients and out, the more clients sit down and they'll say things like, "Wow, there's really nice energy in this room! What is it?" You go, "I don't know but I'm glad you like the room." But of course it's, you know, the energy that's in the room. So the more you work it in your own life, your own lives will improve outside the therapy room and inside the therapy room as well. And so, spiritual - I just want a quick note. Spiritual, I don't mean that by religious. That, if that's a resource for people, that's fabulous. Spiritual to me is about connections with oneself and others and the community and the broader world. So that's what I mean by spiritual. We know that trauma cuts people off from connection. So it's reconnecting people back to what used to give them joy or finding things in their life, finding connections now in their lives that brings them joy and a feeling of belonging. 'Cuz we know with Maslow's hierarchy of needs, belonging's a big part of feeling safe and feeling okay and that, um... I always tell my clients, "Well, you need to go out and find your tribe." You know? So, that's part of what I talk about with spiritual - finding a tribe. And people come back after a while, when they'll be doing a nice trauma resolution work, they go, "Oh my god, I went bike riding on the weekend and I found my tribe!" And they're just glowing because they're... When you work through enough of the trauma, they're able to connect again with other people. And that that in itself starts a whole other healing spiral for them. 

00:32:45
SALENE SOUZA Um, I was just adjusting for... They could do MATES now because we have a meeting and it feels like we could do it... 

00:32:50
DR. ROBY ABELES Oh, yes! So the other thing, we had a video. We had two videos to show you but this system won't let it play. So we'll do MATES. We could do MATES again. Um... and this is... When you work with people initially, in a session, you might actually work, do that little MATES thing with them many, many times in a one hour session. Every time they get s-sort of triggered, you can go, you can say, "Okay, this is a good opportunity to do MATES again." So, let's all do it again 'cuz the more you do it, it's good for you and your whole life as well. So, if you want to do it again? (laughing) 

00:33:25
SALENE SOUZA Do it right away. 

00:33:25
Mind Exercise: "Helpful Thought" 

00:33:25
DR. ROBY ABELES All right. So, and you might decide that there's another helpful thought that's better for you in your real life right now. Um... And th-, it might be something like "I can take care of that later" or, um, "I know someone who can help me with that problem." So, whatever that nice helpful thought is that you have, bring your helpful thought into your mind. Repeat it three thy-, three times in your mind. 

00:34:00
[sil.] 

00:34:05
DR. ROBY ABELES And breathe some air in... and breathe some air out. Notice the air moving easily in... and out. 

00:34:25
[sil.] 

00:34:30
DR. ROBY ABELES And now, imagine that you are a tree... and feel your feet really connected to the ground. Feel supported by the earth, strong and solid like a tree. 

00:34:50
[sil.] 

00:34:55
DR. ROBY ABELES And express in a word how you're feeling right now in your own mind. 

00:35:05
[sil.] 

00:35:10
DR. ROBY ABELES And now, stretch your neck slowly... and look around the room. 

00:35:20
[sil.] 

00:35:25
DR. ROBY ABELES And stretch your arms slowly... as though you're reaching for the sky. 

00:35:35
[sil.] 

00:35:40
DR. ROBY ABELES Stretch your upper body slowly, as though you are dancing. And stretch your legs. Now stretch your hips slowly... 

00:35:55
UNKNOWN Hula hoop. 

00:35:55
DR. ROBY ABELES Yeah, we have to do the hula hoop. One way... and the other way... 

00:36:10
[sil.] 

00:36:15
DR. ROBY ABELES And... 

00:36:15
SALENE SOUZA I finished. 

00:36:15
[laughter] 

00:36:15
DR. ROBY ABELES Okay. Stretch your legs slowly as though you're riding a bicycle. One leg and then the other. And stretch one of your ankles as though you are kicking a ball. 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN Oh, sorry. 

00:36:30
[laughter] 

00:36:30
DR. ROBY ABELES Are you kicking each other under the table? That's okay! 

00:36:35
[laughter] 

00:36:35
SALENE SOUZA Look at that! 

00:36:35
Therapy Essentials • Q: What is the most basic element in a therapy session? • A: The relationship between you and your client. • Q: What is it that clients need to most benefit from your therapy? • A: They need to feel SAFE with you and the process as quickly as possible HOW? MATES 

00:36:35
Put your own oxygen mask on first PRACTICE MATES YOURSELF MATES 

00:36:35
DR. ROBY ABELES Laughing's always good too. And stretching your other ankle. And stretch your whole body as though you're waking up from a nice nap. Okay. And so, did you notice a difference then as well? And so... Some of you got a little bit more energy... Slightly fall asleep. And some of you got a little bit more relaxed, I'm guessing. All right. Um... all right. So, therapy essentials. So, what is the most basic element in a therapy session? And this is sort of what, you know, what we got taught - thank you - what we got taught at counseling school. Um... It's the relationship between you and your client. Because, you know, there's all those values that have shown that a well-meaning individual can be as highly scored by a client as helpful as someone who's done a thousand years of therapy training. So, it's... The relationship is the thing that cannot be discarded. So, um... What is it that clients need to most benefit from your therapy? And that's that they need to feel safe with you and the process as quickly as possible. Um... So, how do we do that? And this is about putting your own oxygen mask on first. Oh, which we happen to have! (laughing) Right here... 

00:38:05
[laughter] 

00:38:10
DR. ROBY ABELES So, we actually have these in the office to show clients. 'Cuz as you know, people learn very differently. Some people learn better by looking and going, "Ha-ha-ha! Yeah, I know what that is." That's all right. So, um... So what is it that this is for? 

00:38:20
UNKNOWN Oxygen... 

00:38:25
DR. ROBY ABELES So... What do we do when we're on a plane and this falls from the ceiling? 

00:38:30
UNKNOWN Put it on to ourselves first. 

00:38:30
DR. ROBY ABELES Put it on to ourselves first. And why do we do that? 

00:38:35
UNKNOWN So, we'll be able to... 

00:38:35
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) ...handle the children... 

00:38:35
DR. ROBY ABELES Very nice! Just like how we prepped you before! She said, "Because we..." 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN (laughing) You know... 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) ...with the planes. 

00:38:45
DR. ROBY ABELES 'Cuz she said... So she said, "We can better deal with clients or children." 

00:38:45
[laughter] 

00:38:50
DR. ROBY ABELES So, yeah, she's not really my sister. 

00:38:50
[laughter] 

00:38:50
DR. ROBY ABELES Yes. So, and then take the... Thing that most therapists... We're not that great at self-care. 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:39:00
Using the Magical Invisible Cord Resonance and Attunement • The therapist who uses MATES in the session will naturally improve the therapeutic relationship and feeling of safety within the client. • If the therapist's nervous system is calm and relaxed, this will be sensed by the client's nervous system, which will resonate, and feel safe • The MHP repeatedly models this with their client, which begins to entrain the client's nervous system to be able to regulate itself. MATES 

00:39:00
DR. ROBY ABELES So that can come through in the therapy session. So, which is why that we really encourage when we teach this to mental health professionals, we really stress that you need to start doing MATES before you, on yourself in the session before you start doing it with your client and do it with your client. So, as you know, you can stay seated doing it. And there are people who just like a couple of the M-A-T-E-S. They might, like, not like all of them but they'll know which ones they like the best and do those most. So it's not a system where you have to do it M-A-T-E-S. Some people, my clients, um, they like to do what we call "top and toe." So they do breathing and tree... air and tree. So they can, anything in between is a bit scary still. So that most people can do, we find, tree. They can feel their feet on the floor without being too triggered and then, the next one is... Some people are scared of breathing but a lot of people can take a breath and not be too triggered. So, but the idea is that you have to put your own oxygen mask on first and that is the MATES keys, M-A-T-E-S. Does that make sense to everybody? Thank you. That's fabulous. So, um, yeah. Practice MATES yourself in session, out of session, in between, all the time. So then, we came to the, um, energetic part of MATES and, um, the nervous system. So we call this the magical invisible cord. So we have to have a way of explaining to people resonance and attunement, um, in a simple way. So, um... If the therapist's nervous system is calm and relaxed, this will be sensed by the client's nervous system, which will resonate and feel safe. So, we're all, like, agreed on that, right? Um, so... The mental health professional repeatedly models this with their client, which begins to entrain the client's nervous system to be able to regulate itself. So, we're just gonna do a little explanation. So, this is the magical invisible cord that we use in the office but any skipping rope or piece of rope will do. And, um... 

00:41:05
SALENE SOUZA But you don't use these actually. 

00:41:10
DR. ROBY ABELES Sometimes. We don't actually use it in the office but if we're teaching parents, sometimes we do. 

00:41:15
SALENE SOUZA Sometimes. 

00:41:15
DR. ROBY ABELES Um... So just to show you, so you get a better idea of what it is exactly. It's so if my client comes in and she's anxious, her nervous system's going like that. Right? So nervous systems tend to mirror one another. So if she's nervous, as we know in our own lives, if someone around us is nervous, we tend to start feeling nervous because nervous systems tend to entrain to what... 

00:41:40
[laughter] 

00:41:40
DR. ROBY ABELES Just one of those clients. So that... (laughs) So, I can just sit here and pretend that I'm not feeling that from her as her therapist. Right? She's all overshot. So... Or I could start doing MATES on myself. So I start to take a breath and put my feet on the floor. Just that. And I have a helpful thought myself, which is, "So okay, she can be nervous. She's gonna learn. We're gonna do this together." Whatever this thought is that helps you. And then, I teach her MATES and then, we can do it together. So... Or if I come rushing in and I've had trouble parking outside my office and I'm running late, then I'm the one doing that. Right? And so... We've had that experience with clients before where they've asked us, "Should-, you know, could you just take a minute and do MATES yourself? 'Cuz you seem stressed." 

00:42:25
[laughter] 

00:42:30
DR. ROBY ABELES So... (laughing) When you know, when you know that clients can teach it back to you, you know you've done your job. So, it's that and so that in session, what happens to us as trauma survivors - lots of us are also trauma survivors. We can tend to go into fight-flight-freeze ourselves when we're in the nervous system of someone who's triggered. Right? So... And look, I don't know how long it takes to resolve all your own issues but most of us, I would say, have a couple left that the client can trigger. So, if the client's telling you information which is parti-, you know, what I find is it's particularly my life story they're telling me, you know, I can tend to go back into that whatever's unresolved in me. So, this, in my opinion, is a re-enactment of their original trauma, where the adult that was supposed to be there for them is now not there for them - energetically. Do you get that? 

00:43:20
UNKNOWN Uh-huh... 

00:43:20
DR. ROBY ABELES Because I'm now trying to deal with the activation in me. So I really lost a lot of, um, connection with my client in that moment. Do you follow it? 

00:43:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:43:35
DR. ROBY ABELES So then I have to do it more. So... 

00:43:35
SALENE SOUZA They're feeling like, "I just want to let it go." 

00:43:40
DR. ROBY ABELES Yes. She's not gonna feel safe in the office. Because normally trauma survivors, particularly like borderline personality disorder people, are excellent at picking up energy - our energy. And if she says to me, "You seem stressed," and I say, "No, I'm not," that's also a re-enactment, isn't it? 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:43:55
DR. ROBY ABELES And I'm trying to be professional by saying, "No, I'm not" but what we do now is, "Yeah, I am actually. I just ran up the stairs." (laughs) "So, let's both do MATES together now until we both feel we're here now." So, a lot of my sessions with MATES now, we start the session and end the session with MATES. And then do it in between as well as needed. Does that make sense to everyone? So that you can, you as therapist, can... If the calmer you make yourself, the calmer her nervous system is going to feel, even if you're not doing much of whatever else you normally do. So really working with our own... It's like a tuning fork - her nervous system. And that with children and, you know, a lot of us when we're traumatized and we're triggered as adults, we go back to that early childhood ways for coping and we're very good at picking up, um, what we needed then and what we need now is a safe nervous system to attune with. Does that make sense? That's what children needed. Like when they got, you know, whatever happened in the park. They needed to run to someone who had a safe and calm nervous system who they felt could handle whatever had just happened. And that's what they need with us, their therapists. Right? They, they're bringing highly activating material to us. They're talking it. They're, they're feeling it and we need to be anchored and grounded and calm. 'Cuz that's what they needed when the event happened. And MATES will help you do that, to be there more for them and less in your own unresolved trauma and more present with them. 'Cuz we're human, you know, we have our own stuff. So MATES really helps the therapist stay present so the client can attune and that... See if they hadn't had that when they were children, their nervous system would be not as likely to dysregulate now. So, we then, our nervous system becomes the nervous system they didn't have as children and it starts every time they come to the office. It starts to attune to that and the more they practice it inside and outside and I practice it inside and outside, every session is another entrainment of their nervous system. Does that make sense? 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:46:10
DR. ROBY ABELES It's fabulous, isn't it? 

00:46:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:46:15
[laughter] 

00:46:15
UNKNOWN Yes, of course. 

00:46:15
What is MATES essentially doing? MATES skills primarily support containment and stabilization for clients, which means bringing them back into their window of tolerance which is the place where they feel more present, grounded and organised. MATES 

00:46:15
How can you use MATES in your work? • Modelling - you can use MATES with yourself during the session which provides a calm, alert and attuned presence. • This is an emotional and energetic source of safety for your clients and their nervous systems. • Teaching - The therapist uses the MATES educational materials and graph along with the MATES simple language to depathologise, destigmatise and normalise the clients' experiences. MATES 

00:46:15
MATES GRAPH MATES Keys to Calm Mind Mind Air Tree Express Stretch 

00:46:15
DR. ROBY ABELES (laughing) Thank you. All right. So, um... What is MATES doing? So, MATES skills primarily support containment and stabilization for clients. And that's what a lot of trauma survivors are looking for, aren't they? Containment and stabilization. That needs to be, like, the primary, you know, th-the short-term goals. Containment and stabilization, um, which means bringing them back into their window of tolerance. A lot of therapies are telling us we need to stay with our client and work within their window of tolerance but there's very little training on how to do it. So MATES is how you do it. Um, and then you can work within the bord-,... Sometimes it's the extreme edges of the window of tolerance we're working within but we're keeping them within a place where all their brain is able to p-, um, benefit from what we're doing with them in the session. Um, and then they... When they're in their window of tolerance, they feel more present, grounded, and organized. And then they can benefit more from what we're doing. I went to a conference many years ago where Bessel van der Kolk was saying that it is completely unethical to work with clients outside their window of tolerance 'cuz they can't benefit from therapy. Which I thought, "Wow, that's a really good point!" But, uh... You know, my early trauma training, we did that all the time. Yeah. So you can me-, use MATES in your work with yourself, which we've said, which provides a calm, alert, and attuned presence with your client. Um, and you... This is an emotional and energetic source of safety for your clients and their nervous systems. You can teach it along with simple language to de-pathologize, de-stigmatize, and normalize the clients' experiences. Now, we have developed this graph... 

00:48:15
SALENE SOUZA It's not the one. 

00:48:15
DR. ROBY ABELES The MATES, we call it the MATES house now. So, um... This is how we explain to them their nervous system. So, it... As you'll see, it's a house with a roof. I'm just gonna come over here. So, this area here, we call the living area of the house and it represents window of tolerance. So, in here is where you have a calm mind and body and your life is more manageable. Up here in the attic is "Fight" and "Flight." So "Fight" we tell them is, um, where you're getting rage, you're always irritated, frustrated, and angry. "Flight," afraid, anxious, panicky, running away, avoiding. And again, we've used simple words to make it easy. Um... 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN What's in there? 

00:49:10
DR. ROBY ABELES The basement, we've got "Freeze," where you feel depressed, numb, helpless, hopeless, ashamed, trapped, suicidal, and weak. So people can generally asso-, relate to any number of those things. So then we explain to them that you can be sort of skipping along in your life in this green, which is regulated and then there's a trigger in your life. And that can be anything from opening a bill that you can't pay to having the ex on the phone, um, you know... I mean you know what triggers are, I don't need to tell you. So you just educate them about what triggers are. And when the trigger gets set off, you get shoved up here into the attic and you go through a door and you get locked up into the attic. So, you know those doors like in big buildings in the city? With the fire exits where you go through and then you can't get back? 

00:50:00
[laughter] 

00:50:05
DR. ROBY ABELES This is that door. So we tell them, "So when you get up in the attic, often you cannot get back, no matter what you do. You're just stuck up here for, you know, days, weeks, months, years." So what you need is you need a key to get you back through this door and that's what the MATES keys are. They're keys to get you back through this door. If you're in the attic for too long, your nervous system gets really worried because it's very bad for your health to have that much adrenaline and cortisol in your system all the time. So your nervous system makes a decision to slam on the brake. So this is the accelerator in your nervous system, the attic. And the basement is the brake on your nervous system. So what happens... You've been in the attic for a while, your nervous system gets scared, slams on the brake, and you get thrown down into the basement, completely missing this living area. And is this sounding familiar? 

00:51:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:51:05
DR. ROBY ABELES And then, here's that door again that locks you out once you get in. So then you can spend days, weeks, months, or years in the basement feeling no energy. And this is too much energy. So depending on what diagnosis your client has, you can explain it based on this. So, bipolar would be here and here, here and here, here and here. Anxiety disorders are flight; combative disorders, fight; depressive disorders, freeze. So, it's a simple way to de-pathologize absolutely any diagnosis people have come with. Um... And what we often do in sessions, 'cuz we have these in our office - posters, we can say to them, "Where have you been most of the week?" They'll say, "I've been in the attic most of the week." All right. And, you know... "I've been way deep in the basement most of the week." So it's a simple way. In the living area also, there's this filing cabinet and one of the first people we taught this to gave us this metaphor. She said, "Ah, yeah, that, that area there, that's like having the filing cabinet where all your important papers are." So, your filing cabinet, when you're in your window of tolerance, is where all your solution finding is, where your ability to problem solve, to connect with others, to access-, which is... The metaphor actually is the frontal lobe. That's where it is. And when you're in the attic or the basement, you cannot access the frontal lobe. But, you know, it's simple, simple language. It's a filing cabinet where all you need to know that's where it is. And if you're, uh, locked out here or here, you can't access. And that's why we needed to do the MATES bracelet. Because when they're here or here, they can't access MATES skills. And I think that's what a lot of problem is with other resourcing techniques. 'Cuz when they're here or here when they need it most, they can't remember what it is they're supposed to be doing to get back in here. Does that make sense to everyone? Do you love that? 

00:53:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, I love it! 

00:53:10
DR. ROBY ABELES People love it! 

00:53:10
[laughter] 

00:53:10
DR. ROBY ABELES And look, this was very much, um, put together by us asking people to help us do it. And... we just went along with that. So, um, yeah. So the keys are here... 

00:53:25
SALENE SOUZA (inaudible) 

00:53:30
DR. ROBY ABELES Yeah. 

00:53:30
SALENE SOUZA It's not covered. 

00:53:30
DR. ROBY ABELES Oh. 

00:53:30
SALENE SOUZA Unfortunately, we have done so much with our presentation and we can not really access the little animation we did. So I'm trying to remember what it was... 

00:53:40
DR. ROBY ABELES So, this, the trigger here... So the trigger is the event. The little "x" here is actually the amygdala in the brain. So, as we know, that's the s-, the limbic system that gets activated. So what we tell people... Should I do the, the fire alarm then? 

00:53:55
SALENE SOUZA Okay. 

00:54:00
DR. ROBY ABELES So, what we tell people is that this represents a fire alarm, the smoke alarm in your brain. So does everyone have a smoke alarm at home? Yes. And what are you supposed to do if you hear the smoke alarm go off? 

00:54:15
UNKNOWN Get out. 

00:54:15
DR. ROBY ABELES What's the first thing you're supposed to do? It's a trick question. 

00:54:20
UNKNOWN Turn it off. Go back to sleep. 

00:54:20
UNKNOWN Look. 

00:54:20
[laughter] 

00:54:25
UNKNOWN That's what I did. 

00:54:25
UNKNOWN Look for problem. 

00:54:25
[laughter] 

00:54:25
DR. ROBY ABELES Some people go back to sleep. 

00:54:25
SALENE SOUZA Okay, that's freeze response. 

00:54:30
DR. ROBY ABELES Yeah, that's just... 

00:54:30
SALENE SOUZA Freeze, freeze response. 

00:54:30
DR. ROBY ABELES You, you're in freeze. 

00:54:30
[laughter] 

00:54:30
UNKNOWN Check for fire. 

00:54:35
DR. ROBY ABELES Yes! No one ever gets that! 

00:54:35
[laughter] 

00:54:35
DR. ROBY ABELES You really are like a loaded room. Check for a fire. Because sometimes we know the smoke alarm goes off for reasons other than there being a fire. 

00:54:50
UNKNOWN Toast is done. 

00:54:50
DR. ROBY ABELES Oh my god! 

00:54:50
UNKNOWN Yes, the trash bin. 

00:54:50
[laughter] 

00:54:50
DR. ROBY ABELES Yes! That's the, that is the metaphor we use. 

00:54:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:54:55
[laughter] 

00:54:55
DR. ROBY ABELES So, yes. Sometimes it's burnt toast. All right? 

00:55:00
UNKNOWN Faulty battery. 

00:55:00
SALENE SOUZA Because she's connected with her sister, probably! 

00:55:00
[laughter] 

00:55:05
DR. ROBY ABELES Yes, or a faulty battery. That's exactly what we said. 

00:55:05
UNKNOWN I'm too scary. 

00:55:05
DR. ROBY ABELES And I think that is part of what makes this really good. It's intuitive. People already know this stuff. 

00:55:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:55:10
DR. ROBY ABELES They're not actually learning anything. They're just collecting what they know into a way that's more helpful for them to understand their own body and responses. 

00:55:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:55:20
DR. ROBY ABELES So, we actually have a broken fire alarm. 

00:55:25
UNKNOWN Oh... 

00:55:25
DR. ROBY ABELES So, we... Yeah, I know. 

00:55:30
[laughter] 

00:55:30
DR. ROBY ABELES So, we actually tell them that when they get triggered and they go straight up into the attic or ultimately, down in the basement, it's because the fire alarm in their brain is broken or it might have a faulty battery. And that what they can do is do MATES. And what MATES does, it brings them back into the window of tolerance where they can check what's the, what's wrong. That's a big piece... 

00:56:00
SALENE SOUZA Reset the smoke alarm. And re-, reset the... 

00:56:05
Drama Spiral X Healing Spiral ATTIC and BASEMENT One thought or event can start dragging you down into the DRAMA SPIRAL, which is the attic and the basement ends in you feeling out of control, awful, too angry, always sad, alone, drunk. It only takes one small trigger for the Drama Spiral to become activated and drag you down, down, down. THE LIVING AREA Luckily, there is also a HEALING SPIRAL, which you can hitch a ride on which will take you back out the other side where life is more manageable. It only takes one small thought, action, behaviour, or skill to engage the Healing Spiral MATES KEYS get you there MATES 

00:56:05
FIGHT-FLIGHT-FREEZE FIGHT or FLIGHT FREEZE MATES 

00:56:05
DR. ROBY ABELES And reset the smoke alarm. So, what a lot of pe-, of our clients and people we've taught it to have said, they get the trigger and they go straight into the fight-flight-freeze assuming the house is on fire... as a metaphor. So that if they can get back to the place where they can actually check... Is this, you know, when a-, um... Is this a burning house or is it burnt toast? And that, that thought, that knowledge starts the nervous system's calming down. You know? It's a bill from the electricity department. It's not a knife in my heart. And if it's a bill, there may be ways that I can he-, have help with that. So in other words, once they... So that's sort of there. Um, so once they go up here, they do MATES, they come back and this resets. We actually gave one of these to a woman who was pregnant and kept having terrible thoughts about what would happen to her or her baby. And she said that was the most amazing thing in the world. She just kept that at home and every time she looked it at, she remembered to check, "Is the building burning? Or is it burnt toast?" So, simple things like that can really be helpful for clients. Yeah. All right. So... We also talk to clients about the, in the, the drama spiral and the healing spiral. 'Cuz in nature, there's polarity. In the universe, there's polarity. Where there's dark, there's light. Where there's drama, there's healing. So, in the attic and the basement - and we kind of draw that for them - um, one thought or event can start dragging you down into the drama spiral, which is the attic and the basement ends in you feeling out of control, awful, too angry, sad, alone, or drunk. It only takes one small trigger for the drama spiral to become activated and drag you down, down, down. The living area, which you now know, um, th-that's the healing spiral, which you can hitch a ride on, which will take you back out the other side where life is more manageable. It only takes one small thought, action, or behavior or skill to engage the healing spiral. And MATES keys get you into the healing spiral, out of that... We just do that, the clients go, "Yeah, I know that." "Do you wanna know that?" "Yeah, I wanna know that." So, I think we've sort of gone through fight and flight and freeze but can you put it back on? Well I love that. I love the little dog's like... Um, and we do use, like Salene with kids, she might, um, print that out and use that with kids. You know, really fight, flight, or freeze. So, cute little pictures... 

00:58:55
SALENE SOUZA ...It's cute. 

00:58:55
BRAKE AND ACCELERATOR Parasympathetic Sympathetic Ganglion 

00:58:55
Smoke Alarm and Burnt Toast TEST YOUR ALARM DAILY BURNT TOAST MATES 

00:58:55
DR. ROBY ABELES Yeah. And kids get it. You know? "I've been more like that this week. I've been more like that this week." Or "I've been..." And when people can track where they are, they know where they're going, where they'd like to be instead. So this is just the nervous system, the brake and the accelerator in the nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. If you have clients that are very cognitive and academic, they love this stuff. So, you can present to them more advanced material. But it just shows you that when you're in acceleration, what's happening inside your body. A lot of clients don't know things are happening inside their body or what it is. Um, and too much focus on inner sensation can feed into a drama spiral, where they feel the heart racing... 

00:59:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:59:40
DR. ROBY ABELES ...and that makes them feel like the house is burning rather than burnt toast. So you can show them that, you know, that basically, if you're too there, you can do MATES and come more here. If you're too flat, you can do MATES and get more energy. So, it works both ways. And there's your burnt toast. 

01:00:00
[laughter] 

01:00:00
MIND MIND is a way to find a helpful thought to bring the person quickly out of the negative thinking, which leads to the drama spiral. MATES 

01:00:05
DR. ROBY ABELES So, yes. So, we've talked about that. And, um... So Mind is a way to find a helpful thought to bring the person quickly out of negative thinking, which leads to the drama spiral. So when we talk about a helpful thought, um, a lot of the clients we've had have been taught affirmations and that does not work. It's too far off from where they are. So a helpful thought is just the thought that is a millimeter in the direction of a positive thought. It's still way far from a positive thought! But it's at least going in that direction. Does that make sense? 

01:00:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:00:35
AIR Every emotion has its own breathing pattern. AIR is using breath as a way to become present. MATES 

01:00:40
DR. ROBY ABELES And it has to feel 100% true in the moment. So, for a lot of our, um, clients, it'll be "I'm learning new skills that might help me." And that's at least as no-, "I'm hopeless and nothing's gonna help me." So, just a millimeter in the direction of positive without being so positive they can't relate or grab it. And work with people. It might take a few goes to get one that's 100% true in the moment. And they'll know when they've got it. They'll feel it. "Yeah, I can absolutely believe that." So, Air - every emotion has its own breathing pattern. Um, as you know, like you, if you're very anxious, what do you think your breathing might be like? 

01:01:20
UNKNOWN Short. 

01:01:25
DR. ROBY ABELES Short and fast. Yeah. Like panting, kinda. Or holding your breath. And then, what would be the breathing pattern for someone who's really angry? 

01:01:35
UNKNOWN Giant. 

01:01:35
DR. ROBY ABELES Yeah, big brea-, big breaths and lots of energy. Big, deep breaths. So, 'cuz that's sending nice oxygen to your arms and legs. So, and then someone who might be depressed, what might their breathing pattern be? 

01:01:50
UNKNOWN Slow. Shallow. 

01:01:50
TREE • TREE is a grounding exercise. • Trauma/stress makes us lose the ability to stay in the present moment, grounding helps to bring us back. • Being aware of our feet is a simple way to begin this process. • The more grounded you feel, the less worried you will feel. • Being present in our feet makes us feel more empowered to take action and find solutions. 

01:01:50
EXPRESS EXPRESS is a way to help people become aware of their emotional state. If you name the feeling, and accept that feeling, then you can see what your next step is. You may need to help them find words for their feelings For example: Angry Grateful Sad Afraid Calm hamed Happy Guilty Hopeful MATES 

01:01:50
DR. ROBY ABELES Slow, shallow... You know, and, and collapsed body. Um... So, Air is using breath as a way to become present. There's been a lot of breathing stuff we, you know, we've all learned. One thing that you can say to people is "Just be aware of your breath right now without trying to change it or do anything." And the beautiful thing about breath is if you bring a witness to it, it tends to regulate itself without any direction at all. So, yes. But a therapist is saying, "Yes, yes, yes!" (laughs) Yeah. So, you can just say, "Let's just both be aware of our breaths right now." So, it's more collaborative as well. It's like us. We're doing it together. Um... So, Tree is a grounding exercise and trauma and stress make us lose the ability to stay in the present moment and grounding helps bring us back. Um... Being aware of our feet is a simple way to begin the process to the more grounded you feel, the less worried you'll feel. Um... It's sort of knowing where you are in space... Trauma tends to knock us out of where we are in space. Um... Being present in our feet makes feel us more empowered to take action and find solutions. So, Express is a way to help people become aware of their emotional state. Now, you've all had lots and lots of training in how to help people express. So, um, but... Sometimes we need to help clients find words for their feelings. Um... I think, um, I supervise a lot of new int-, new therapists and sometimes they don't understand why people can't say what they feel. That's because it's a, it's another language. And if they never learn the language, you don't know the language now. So, we just give people simple words to help them. Because people can feel very ashamed that they don't know the word for what they're feeling. 

01:03:35
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

01:03:35
EXPRESS You may need to help them find words for their sensations For example: Numb Shaky Tingly Nauseous Cold Warm Heav Light Tight Open Foggy Spacey MATES 

01:03:35
EXPRESS MATES helps clients accept their emotions Identifying the feeling helps us know if we need to do more MATES to get back into the Living Area MATES 

01:03:35
STRETCH SPROUTS STRETCH MATES 

01:03:35
STRETCH STRETCH is using gentle movement to allow the body/mind to relax and/or feel energetic, whatever it needs. Slow stretching is the antidote to the freeze state and provides the brake to the fight-flight response. MATES 

01:03:35
More Resources Gorilla, Butterfly, Ladybug HUG This alternating tapping on the body helps people's nervous system calm down, integrates the brain, provides physical containment and brings you to the present moment allowing checking of the "smoke alarm". MATES 

01:03:35
DR. ROBY ABELES So, it's just going back, sort of, back to see people, some people need to start there. Um... and then, also, sensation. People are much less able to talk about sensation in the body. So we have a poster and different things with the name of some sensation in the body so they can start to identify what it is and not be so scared by it. Sometimes if you have a word for what that feeling is and someone normalizes it for you, then they don't get so scared by a racing heart. "So, that's okay. That's gonna normalize. Don't worry about that. That's, that's... People feel that when they feel like shit." Um, okay... People, um, may need help accepting their emotions and I think, you probably know, you've been taught that. Um... Identifying the feeling helps us know if we need to do more MATES to get back into the living area. So, if someone can identify how they're feeling, they can also then see the intensity of the feeling. And if it's beyond their capa-, window of tolerance, that's when you do MATES. So, you don't do MATES with people when they're in the window of tolerance, because part of what we want to help people do is build capacity for emotion and sensation. So, it's like, um, homeopathic. It's like, "Let's do one more second of feeling that sadness before we go to MATES." So that over time, the capacity to feel the sadness builds. The reason that people go into fight-flight-freeze is that their capacity to feel the emotion gets, gets filled so quickly. So we're actually building the container within which, um, the emotion is held inside the body. It's kinda like if you've only got a, a stamp-sized container for sadness, you're very quickly overwhelmed when you get sad. But if over time you can tolerate it for one second more, one second more, it starts to grow into a matchbox-sized... And more and more and more as you do that very, very gently titrating, eventually, it's your whole body. You try telling people it's like a swimming pool, an Olympic swimming pool, it's so big. And then, you won't be a-, you won't be so overwhelmed. And if you're building capacity for sadness, say, you're also, that container is also, you're gonna feel more joy when you feel joy. And you're gonna, you know, feel more happiness. You're gonna feel, be, have capacity to feel more. So, that's part of identifying emotions, it's working into that process. Yeah? Stretching. So why is stretching good? Um... So, they say that stretching, that exercise is important and that stretching is the most important part, so why bother with the rest? So... Um, but we know that Stretch is using gentle movement to allow the body/mind to relax or feel energetic, whatever it needs. The body has wisdom. So if you're lacking energy, it'll bring it in and if you need to discharge some energy, it'll push it out. Um... Slow stretching is the antidote to the freeze response. If you see a client in a session, very frozen with that 1,000 yard stare, do MATES and it'll bring them out of the freeze pretty quickly. Um... It provides the brake to the fight-flight response. So we're giving you a couple more resources that we use. They're not exactly in MATES but we're giving them to you anyway. So, um... There's the butterfly hug. Do you wanna do an example of it? So the butterfly hug... 

01:06:50
SALENE SOUZA ...is this. 

01:06:50
DR. ROBY ABELES Do you, E.M.D., any E.M.D.R. people? 

01:06:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:06:55
DR. ROBY ABELES Yeah, so... So, the butterfly hug was developed by Lucina Artigas, um, and Ignacio Jarero post-Hurricane Pauline in Mexico. And they were working with hundreds of children. Um... So this alternating tapping on the body helps people's nervous system calm down, integrates the brain, provides physical containment by the hugging, um, and brings you to the present moment allowing checking the, so you can check smoke alarm. So, do you like how it feels? 

01:07:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:07:25
DR. ROBY ABELES It's kinda nice. 

01:07:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:07:25
DR. ROBY ABELES Um, okay. The gorilla... The, um... So... Some people don't like to have butterfly hugs. Some very tough little boys prefer gorilla hugs. Or men. Or other people who just don't like butterflies for whatever really reasons. So, you can do that. But it has the same effect. And it's crossed arms and one wing at a time. All right? And... There's the ladybug hug. So, it's, what it's doing basically is alternately stimulating the left and then the right side of the brain. 

01:08:00
SALENE SOUZA One side. 

01:08:00
DR. ROBY ABELES One side and then the other side. One side... Like wings from a butterf-, oh, that's probably not a good example. But, yes, butterfly does most together. So no, pretend your butterfly can only do one wing at a time. 

01:08:15
UNKNOWN Ladybugs do. 

01:08:15
SALENE SOUZA You can just do... 

01:08:15
DR. ROBY ABELES Ladybugs do. 

01:08:20
UNKNOWN That's fine. Ah! 

01:08:20
DR. ROBY ABELES So, yes. So, it's just another way of, of having the whole brain involved in the process so that you have more of the ability for your whole brain to calm you down. The more integrated you start to become, that starts, um, starts a process where as you notice you're getting calmer, your body gets calmer noticing that it's getting calmer, noticing that it's getting calmer. The more awareness that you bring to whatever's happening in the moment... So if you bring awareness to the fact that you're anxious, your anxiety will get bigger. If you bring awareness to the fact that you actually feel a little more calm, your more calm will get bigger. Does that make sense? 

01:08:55
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

01:08:55
More Resources YAWNING Yawning reset the brain and brings more oxygen to it and that helps you calm down. When people re-enter The Living Area they often begin to spontaneously yawn. MATES 

01:09:00
DR. ROBY ABELES So, this is a way of... People who have been traumatized are exquisitely attuned to what's wrong. So, this is trying to help them be exquisitely attuned to what's feeling a little bit better. Okay. And more resources. So... Yawning. And I noticed a couple of you, after you did the MATES, started yawning. And that's what we noticed with our clients as well. So yawning resets the brain. It brings more oxygen and that helps you calm down. The feeling of not having enough oxygen can trigger an anxiety attack. So, we're always... I have several clients that they yawn the entire session and we just laugh about it now. It's like they're trying to talk to me in between yawning. But they understand 'cuz I framed it for them this is fabulous, this is your body just letting go of stress. It's really good. So, yeah... So people just start spontaneously yawning. That's your indication also they're in the living area. It's a good, really good. They're in their window of tolerance. You don't necess-, if you think of when you're the most stressed in your life like running out of a burning building, you rarely see anyone yawning. 

01:10:05
[laughter] 

01:10:10
DR. ROBY ABELES Yes but when you're calm sitting in front of a T.V. feeling safe, that's kinda when you're more yawning. All right. 

01:10:15
SALENE SOUZA Practice now? 

01:10:15
Mind Exercise: "Resources" 

01:10:15
DR. ROBY ABELES We could do another practice of MATES because we want you to get as much as you can. So... Here we go. Salene... All right! So, all of you, think of a helpful thought. 

01:10:30
[sil.] 

01:10:35
DR. ROBY ABELES You can stand up. You can sit down. You can do whatever's most comfortable for you. In your mind, think about your helpful thought. And repeat it three times in your mind. 

01:10:50
[sil.] 

01:10:55
DR. ROBY ABELES And now, breathe some air in... and breathe some air out. Now, just notice the air moving easily in... and out. 

01:11:10
[sil.] 

01:11:20
DR. ROBY ABELES And now, imagine that you are a tree. And feel your feet connected to the ground. Feel supported by the earth, strong and solid like a tree. 

01:11:35
[sil.] 

01:11:40
DR. ROBY ABELES And now you can express in a word how you're feeling right now. And you can notice that feeling again while you do the butterfly hug. 

01:11:55
[sil.] 

01:12:00
DR. ROBY ABELES And now you can stretch your neck slowly and look around the room. And stretch your arms slowly as though you're reaching for the sky. And yawn if you like. (laughing) Now, stretch your upper body slowly as though you are dancing. 

01:12:30
[sil.] 

01:12:35
DR. ROBY ABELES And stretch your hips slowly as though you're playing with a hula hoop. 

01:12:40
[sil.] 

01:12:45
DR. ROBY ABELES Very good. And stretch your legs slowly as though you're riding a bicycle. That's it. And now, you can stretch one of your ankles as though you're kicking a ball. And now your other ankle. Very good. And now you can stretch your whole body as though you're waking up from a nice nap. 

01:13:15
[sil.] 

01:13:20
DR. ROBY ABELES Very good. You, you're a fabulous group! 

01:13:20
[laughter] 

01:13:20
DR. ROBY ABELES All right. So, um... So, we're gonna give you each a MATES bracelet so that you can practice MATES in your own lives, um, and in your sessions with clients. So, Salene's gonna hand those out. Um... I think that's, is that the end? Yes. 

01:13:45
UNKNOWN I just wanted to ask. Do we get (clears throat) a copy of your notes? 

01:13:45
DR. ROBY ABELES I don't know. 

01:13:50
UNKNOWN No? 

01:13:50
UNKNOWN It'd be great if you would be... 

01:13:50
DR. ROBY ABELES Yeah, I don't know. I'll ask... They've got all your names. So we can ask them. 

01:14:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, maybe try out in just this town. 

01:14:00
DR. ROBY ABELES Or the other thing is we have a website. 

01:14:00
UNKNOWN Oh! Yeah. 

01:14:05
DR. ROBY ABELES Maybe if you emailed us... 

01:14:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:14:05
DR. ROBY ABELES So our website I think is in, on the next... 

01:14:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yes. 

01:14:10
UNKNOWN Nice.

01:14:20
WELCOME TO THE MATES RESOURCING PROGRAM COMMUNITY www.matesprogram.com.au For more information, training, and products MATES Resourcing Program www.matesprogram.com.au 

01:14:20
DR. ROBY ABELES Um... It engages the healing spiral and the ability to enter the living area. And MATES, when practiced by you, assists you to stay within your own window of tolerance and as a result, be the sa-, source of safety for your client's nervous system. It's an easy, simple, de-pathologizing, regulating, stabilizing, and empowering resource model. And that's our website. Um... It hasn't been up that long. So... Hopefully, it's all working - no glitches. Yes? So, any questions and answers now. So I think if you can... You won't be on film but we need the mike to get your question. So Salene will bring the mike to you. 

01:15:00
UNKNOWN Do you have this diagram that we can copy? On the website or...? 

01:15:05
DR. ROBY ABELES Yes. So, um... The question was do we have the MATES house diagram, um, available for you. Yes, we have it. Um... We have the bracelets. We have that diagram in various sizes and we have A4 and then... uh, bigger ones. So, all that you can go to the website to the product section. 

01:15:25
UNKNOWN All right. Well, thank you. 

01:15:25
DR. ROBY ABELES Yeah, any other questions? 

01:15:25
UNKNOWN Yes, um... I, um, I work in Deby (PH), W-I with indigenous population. 

01:15:35
DR. ROBY ABELES Yup. 

01:15:35
UNKNOWN And it's a, a, uh, it's got the highest suicide in the world. 

01:15:35
DR. ROBY ABELES Yeah. 

01:15:40
UNKNOWN And 100% by hanging. So you think the tree metaphor would really treat that? 

01:15:45
DR. ROBY ABELES (crosstalk) Yes. Yes. 

01:15:45
UNKNOWN A serious... 

01:15:45
DR. ROBY ABELES Yes. Yes. 

01:15:45
UNKNOWN ...response. 

01:15:45
DR. ROBY ABELES And I'll have Salene answer that for you because she had a client who really didn't like the tree, either. 

01:15:50
SALENE SOUZA Yeah, uh, my client... I asked him what would be the, what would be helpful for him to feel grounded. And he said, "If I feel Jesus' hands in the back of my, my back, so I can feel his hand there." And I said, "Okay, so that's gonna be your tree. We don't need to call it the tree." I think that's... 

01:16:05
DR. ROBY ABELES So, it's just anything that you can develop with them to ground. So if it's feel themselves connected to Mother Earth, that'll work. 

01:16:15
UNKNOWN What I'm just thinking is even that mention in the beginning. So I'm just wondering where the issue be tweaked aside that, uh, what is your, you know, like, ask the clients... A client generated... 

01:16:30
DR. ROBY ABELES Yes. 

01:16:30
UNKNOWN ...metaphor rather than a... 

01:16:30
DR. ROBY ABELES Yes. 

01:16:30
UNKNOWN ...and so... 

01:16:30
DR. ROBY ABELES Yes, yes, yes! And look, I think that's the thing with MATES. We don't teach it as like you have to do it this way. So... But as long as you get something that's gonna help them ground. And as I said, there's some people who only do the breathing and the grounding. They never deal with helpful thought. So if you work with a particular community or you know, the... some other grounding would be more natural for them, go for that. The other thing that we've noticed is that just introducing it so that you... So you don't have to introduce it as MATES, introduce it however you want to introduce it. Any other questions? No? I think we've got a few minutes. Yeah? 

01:17:10
UNKNOWN Just got a... Just wanted... 

01:17:10
DR. ROBY ABELES One, if you wait just one sec so the sound can get your question. Thank you. 

01:17:15
UNKNOWN Just got a question in relation to the two day training. 

01:17:20
DR. ROBY ABELES Yup. 

01:17:20
UNKNOWN Um... Is that something that I could come and see you about later? From a... 

01:17:25
DR. ROBY ABELES Yes, we... On the website, we... 

01:17:30
UNKNOWN Organization I can speak to? 

01:17:30
DR. ROBY ABELES Yes, yes. And... Agencies, um, have us come to their agency to teach all their stuff. So we've done a few in Sydney. We're doing another one in Townsville next month. 

01:17:40
UNKNOWN Fabulous. Where are you based? 

01:17:45
DR. ROBY ABELES In Sydney. 

01:17:45
UNKNOWN Okay, great. 

01:17:45
DR. ROBY ABELES Um, but yes. Definitely. 

01:17:45
UNKNOWN So just go to the website and there's a link there somewhere? 

01:17:50
DR. ROBY ABELES Yeah, so there's a section, I think, called "Workshops and Registrations." 

01:17:50
SALENE SOUZA No. 

01:17:55
DR. ROBY ABELES Sorry? 

01:17:55
SALENE SOUZA No. Shop. 

01:17:55
DR. ROBY ABELES No. For the web-, ... Anyway, you'll find it at Workshops. 

01:18:00
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:18:00
DR. ROBY ABELES So, yeah. We've got, um... And there's actually a couple of spaces for the Townsville training. We're opening it up to a fe-, to a few other people. There's four spaces left, I believe. 

01:18:10
UNKNOWN Today would be the last day for... 

01:18:10
DR. ROBY ABELES Early bird. 

01:18:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, but if you let us know that you're here, you can still... 

01:18:15
DR. ROBY ABELES Yes, if it's you, we'll let you have the early bird for longer. 

01:18:15
[laughter] 

01:18:20
DR. ROBY ABELES But yeah, we've got a, I believe, four spaces left in the Townsville training, which is October 27 and 28, I think. It's a Sunday, Monday, um, up in main part of Townsville on the strand there. There's another question at the back. 

01:18:35
UNKNOWN I was just gonna say is they're much more involved in the training in their two day... 

01:18:35
DR. ROBY ABELES There's... You get to practice more with one another. Um... We also have you sit together and explain the, the MATES house to one another. Um, so... You know, so there's a bit more, sort of, in-in... yeah... 

01:18:50
SALENE SOUZA And we talk more about the brain as well. 

01:18:50
DR. ROBY ABELES Yeah, more about the brain, more about Polyvagal, social engagement... So if it was, it was a, uh, real challenge for us to get it all into 90 minutes but... Yeah, so it, it's also the pacing of it is a little slower. I don't talk as fast. 

01:19:05
[laughter] 

01:19:05
DR. ROBY ABELES Um, so... 

01:19:05
SALENE SOUZA And we don't use PowerPoint. 

01:19:10
DR. ROBY ABELES Yeah, we don't use PowerPoint. So this is, this is really multi-tasking for me. So, yeah. Yeah? Anything else? Yes. 

01:19:20
UNKNOWN It's not a question. It's actually some feedback for you. 

01:19:25
DR. ROBY ABELES Yes. 

01:19:25
UNKNOWN Um... Like probably many people in this room, I've been in this industry for nearly 20 years or more. And I've done mammoth amount of training in trauma. 

01:19:35
DR. ROBY ABELES Yeah. 

01:19:35
UNKNOWN And I have to say that this is so easy... 

01:19:40

01:19:40
UNKNOWN ...that it's so doable. 

01:19:45

01:20:05
UNKNOWN Do you have children-sized bracelets? 

01:20:05
DR. ROBY ABELES Um... We're gonna have more made. And it's really how to get actual children size. I don't know why. But we're looking to do that. Yeah. 

01:20:15
UNKNOWN I just want to ask a favor for people who was taking picture of the whole thing, if you'd like to have the Powerpoint present as any, an email.
