CARLOS For me being bipolar means that I'm you have long periods of just feeling normal and having a job and doing what everyone else does and there will be periods where your feelings of feeling low and down and depressed, gets so out of control that it gets to a point where you can't function, you can't work, you can't laugh(ph), you can't… you can't get out of bed. And then this is other extreme, when you totally high and you can't work and you can't laugh(ph) and you can't function and and you are always out of bed. 

00:01:50
LIVING WELL WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER 

00:01:55
VICKI Every night of the week I was going out. I was not sleeping. I believed I was the Virgin Mary. At the peak of the psychosis I wanted to save everybody in sort of red light district of Sydney, and I was a danger to myself. I wasn't a danger to others but I was endangering my reputation. 

00:02:15
GERALD I was in hospital for the first time for a very long time. I was in for about five or six weeks. That was when I was first diagnosed that was when the doctor first came to me and said you have manic depressive illness and I didn't have any idea what that was. I just sort of shrugged my shoulders and said thanks very much. I'll see you later. 

00:02:35
CHARLENE I probably first got it, in my early teen(ph) umm… but I started like using a lot of drugs, I was smoking lot of pot and stuff like that umm… and but I was really maniac all the time. I always had too much energy I feel like and that's why I was smoking a lot of drugs to calm myself down. 

00:02:55
ROSS Things were totally out of perspective, you know, like I was thinking about the lawn, how am I going to mow the lawn? You know I can't do it. I can't possibly do it you know. And it’s sort of when you are depressed you can't, you can't believe if you don't know how hard these things are. 

00:03:15
CARLOS For me I usually get high after I've been depressed. So this makes it even more complicated because it means that as I start to feel better like, the highness actually starts to make me feel normal in the beginning. 

00:03:30
ROSS I sort of thought Jeez things.. things are getting all right. You know I'm… I'm going to go up to Queensland on a trip. You know this is going to be good and anyway I'd swapped over. I'd swapped from depression to going high or manic whatever they call. It's manic isn't it yeah… yeah. And so anyway I headed off on this trip and went up to Queensland and did parachuting which you know I know a lot of people do it but you know I've always been terrified of heights. 

00:04:10
CARLOS And you go, well so this is what normal people feel like they… they don't have to sleep 12 hours a day and then I feel confident and I then you go wow! This is great and it's great. 

00:04:20
ROSS I went nylon fishing and I went uh… you know took a trip up to Cape York in a plane and oh I was wonderful okay you know you could do things, you know and make decisions buy a (inaudible ) you know I'm sick of that now. 

00:04:40
CARLOS You slowly begin to lose insight. You slowly start to… to not know now what's happening. 

00:04:45
ROSS You feel so… so, you know on top of the world. You know like you are in charge and probably you're influencing Australia and you can think lots of better place you know you are really good. You know. 

00:05:00
CARLOS And then you know, you might start think well, you know, may be I am the son of god and… 

00:05:05
DR. MEG SMITH President, New South Wales Association for Mental Health There seem to be a number of types of bipolar disorder. There's bipolar I disorder which is the type I have and that's basically sort of extremes of mood you know ranging from mania which is often severe enough to need you know… need to go to hospital. And severe depression that again is severe enough to sort of need you know 24 hour-care, you know with risk of suicide. Ah… that's called bipolar I disorder. There's bipolar II disorder where the person has fairly awful episodes of depression and episodes of hypomania which aren't severe enough to get the person into hospital so the person just appears to be pretty creative and energetic at times and pretty depressed at other times. 

00:05:50
DR. PHILIP MITCHELL Director, Mood Disorders Unit, Prince of Wales Hospital I feel bipolar disorder is a very treatable condition. Although that the mood swings can be quite severe, these days we’re having very good treatments for the condition. So I'm optimistic for the vast majority of people that I treat with bipolar disorder. The treatment the… probably the centre piece of treatment is medications because it is a very physical condition, but these days we are becoming aware that there are significant psychological and social factors that can worsen the illness or contribute to it or can be disrupted by the illness so we are becoming increasingly aware of psychological treatments. 

00:06:25
DR. MEG SMITH In some ways for me it was a relief to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder because I could sort of say well I catch not my personality. I don't have a full personality. Umm… I now know what the limits are of my functioning are and I do know now that this medication that can help to reduce some of the sort of the symptoms I’ve been getting. 

00:06:45
DR. MEG SMITH It made a lot of things make sense in order made because before anytime I would stop using drugs it felt like I needed the drugs because I was in home when you know I wasn't using them. But a kind of made me understand I just you know had a problem and say you know realized that there are other ways that I could kinda manage that problem and that you know allow me and take the drugs out of my life. 

00:07:10
ROSS You think to yourself Oh! No I couldn't have bipolar disease. You… you just only think that somebody else, you know it shouldn't be you, you know that's the hardest thing, that's trying to accept that you've got the illness. 

00:07:25
GERALD Ha… yeah acceptance is definitely the hardest thing. For so long it just takes you know you just denying it. You're telling everyone else to get stuffed and you know you know you are not going to take the medication and you don't need the medication. You know you're fine and everyone else is stuffed you know everyone else can get bugged you know that it's… it's like you versus the world you know. But… but… but when you are doing that, you've got like you're spending so much energy you know you sort of like. It's you versus your illness and you versus the world. But then when you take the illness as part of you it's like it's almost like the illness can work for you 

00:08:10
Medication 

00:08:15
DR. MEG SMITH The key to managing manic depressive illness is medication and it's complicated medication. There is a whole range of medications and it's powerful medication. 

00:08:25
DR. PHILIP MITCHELL I tend to think of three phases of the illness that we are treating. The first is the treatment of acute mania, the second is the depressed phase of the illness and the third is the prevention. Umm… stopping future episodes of depression and mania. If we look at the treatment of acute mania and the prevention, that the treatments are quite similar that we are using what we call mood stabilizer medications. Mood stabilizers are medications that treat the acute unwellness during mania and prevent newer episodes. People would be most familiar with lithium, which has been around for 50 years. 

00:09:05
ROSS When… when you get those highs and lows it's not a good… it's not a good life that's for sure. But now sort of even down now I don't get the mood swings. I… yeah I feel, feel a lot better and I'll sort of look back to the times when I had those big mood swings and I think you know Jeez I don't want to do that again. 

00:09:25
DR. PHILIP MITCHELL There are also two other treatments that we call mood stabilizers and the brand names for those are Epilim, which is otherwise known as sodium valproate and Tegretal, which is carbamazepine and these medications are effective for calming the acute manic disturbance as well as stopping future episodes. 

00:09:45
VICKI Lithium didn't work for me and I think that's really important to let people know because lithiums not always a wonder drug for everyone. It was only when I got on Epilim and Tegretol although now I only take Epilim because I've gotten better that I… my thinking was clear for the first time. 

00:10:05
DR. MEG SMITH The good thing about the… the prophylactic drugs is that they don't interfere with your functioning. They don't affect your personality. They don't affect your creativity. They simply regulate the mood. Ah… you know ah… people who are creative artist who take lithium say they are more productive. Feel like get more things done when they’re lithium. It doesn't affect the way you view the world. It just… all it will do is regulate the amount of energy you've got and help you to order that energy so that you can actually produce something at the end of it. 

00:10:40
DR. PHILIP MITCHELL When people are manic the behavior can be quite disrupted. Now the difficulty with the mood stabilizers is that they're going to take about a week or two to work. So if you got a family member who is acutely manic you can't wait a week or two to start to calm the behavior. We use the anti-psychotic medications to calm someone down. 

00:11:00
ROSS When I went into the psychiatric wards and you know I stayed there in a manic state you know and you have… you have the lithium and I think they give you Medrol as well probably the same as I had now and you know within a matter of couple of days you know, you're sort, you're sort of more normal. 

00:11:25
DR. PHILIP MITCHELL Usually we withdraw the antipsychotic medications once the manic episodes starts to settle. During the repressed phase of the illness an antidepressant is use again to be necessary as well as the mood stabilizer. Antidepressants are going to take normally one to two weeks to work so you have to be patient and just give time. 

00:11:45
Discuss the side effects of antidepressants and ECT with your doctor. 

00:11:45
DR. PHILIP MITCHELL Occasionally if someone is very depressed we might need to consider an older treatment such as ECT. But in these days this would be uncommonly used although people shouldn't be scared if that's going to be necessary. 

00:12:00
ROSS I've had a manic attack when… when I had been on lithium I was on it and… and I was still got it but… but see then it comes into like we are saying before. If you are under stress, I was under stress and I was sort of moving around trying to find… find places to sort of stay and it stressed me and I reckon that's why I when… I had, had the manic attack. 

00:12:25
DR. MEG SMITH You can religiously take your pills but you know if there is some stress in your life it's not going to upset or protect you entirely. It may mean that you won't have quite a severe a episode as you would have had without the pills. But it may not mean you know it may be that you are still going to have an episode of mood disorder anyway despite taking the medication. 

00:12:45
VICKI The choice was to take… take your medication you might… might not be well like you might still be up and down, up and down but it's better than taking no medication at all because I had one episode where I was going out with a particular man who was very health conscious and places(ph) hard he was trying to do the best. He didn't like me taking medicine. So went on a naturopath journey, but didn't actually see a naturopath and went jogging in the morning instead of the anti-depressive. We replaced everything with natural things, drank honey and milk at night instead of a sedative. But there was no mood stabilizer and that's what I… I have a mood disorder and very quickly I went into the worst psychotic episode I've ever had where I was homeless. I left home, I didn’t think there was anything wrong with being homeless. 

00:13:40
DR. MEG SMITH I know myself when I was told you've got to take this medication. I did want to medication. I feel fine. Why should I take medication, particularly when it gives me some effects you know side effect that I don’t like, but I think from what I've learnt over the years I now know that it's essential to take the medication. 

00:13:55
DR. PHILIP MITCHELL Let's have a look at some of the side effects that can occur with some of the medications that we use for bipolar disorder. If we look at lithium, I guess in the first few days the most common side effects when that's instituted are nausea, which is the sick feeling on the tummy. Occasionally vomiting although in my experience it's most uncommon and diarrhea. 

00:14:15
GERALD Taking lithium for the first time ha… I just I couldn't stand. I… I troubled taking the tablets physically. I was gagging on the tablets at the beginning. For me they are quite large tablets nowadays I can take you know truck lot of the things and I don’t have a problem but some yeah and I didn't like the way that I may be feel. I had problems with my hands and I still problems in my hands at this time. My hands tremor and shake all the time pretty much and it's a very disconcerting and embarrassing thing for me. 

00:14:50
DR. PHILIP MITCHELL These usually settle down if they don't they respond to a reduction in the dose of the medication that what we call dose-relating side effects. I guess one of the other side effects that long term worries people beside of weight gain and about 30 to 40% of people who are taking lithium do gain weight. This is very frustrating. I advise people to be very careful about their diet, occasionally people get craving for sweet food and people find that off because the thirst, which is another side effect on lithium that they might take many soft drinks. 

00:15:25
VICK There are long-term side effects for Epilim as well that I'm aware of. So it is you need… you need to know that… that there could be side effects with things and but don't stop. I never stopped taking my medication because of the side effects and I think that stood me in good stead at the time some people didn't agree with me. But they were the one's getting ill and I wasn't so yeah. 

00:15:50
GERALD After taking the, the lithium for a time I just accepted and you know tried to make the best of it and after a while I just didn’t even know I was really taking it you know it's becomes part of life. But it's very important I do take it twice a day, otherwise I can become unwell. 

00:16:10
DR. MEG SMITH Coming on and off medication is dangerous. I don't recommend doing it unless you consult with your doctor or health worker about why you want to come off the medication or whether you’re going to need to change the medication or what have you. Some of the drugs that are used to treat people with bipolar disorder do have consequences if you come off them abruptly. You know, you do need to come off the drugs under some kind of medical supervision and to have some kind of medical information about you know how you come off the drugs and what effects are going to happen you know if you come off the drugs and what have you. I'm very grateful to medication. I wouldn't be sitting here today if it wasn't for medication. But it is hard work learning about what the medication can do? What type of medication I need to take and when I’ll need to take it. It really does mean having a good working partnership you know with your doctor to find out you know what medications available? When you need to take it? How much you need to take? And have a sort of close monitoring to make sure that the effects you are getting from the medication are in fact reducing the symptoms of the mood disorder. 

00:17:20
Early Warning Signs 

00:17:25
GERALD I’m thinking(ph) last three or four years I've been hospitalized about six times mainly because of cannabis. I have a period of about two to three days only maximum before I'm thoroughly off with the fairies same things sometimes hearing voices even, full schizoid delusions. So going from not eating, sleeping or being bit irrational and my mom is good at spotting those sort of traits these days to yeah being totally out of it. 

00:18:05
DR. MEG SMITH I think it's important to recognize that people can prevent relapses or mood disorder. You might not be able to prevent the first episode because you've got no idea how it is going to happen. You may not be able to prevent the second episode because hey you're still learning. But one of the things that I find really interesting and amazing is that as people get older they do learn to prevent the episodes. And I think there is a number of things that people can do, one is to look at your previous episodes and say what was going on in my life around about those episodes? What kind of triggers are likely to sort of set me off? Is it illness in a close friend or family member? Is it travelling? Is it you know shift work? Is it breaking up a relationship? What is it? You know what are the sorts of stresses that trigger me off? What happens when I you know get under stress? Do I stop sleeping? Do I stop eating? Do I you know take on more activities? But what actually happens 

00:19:00
GERALD We may usually had some if I missed a bit of medication or I'm not sleeping this will lead to, to the symptoms of mania and the early warning signs are not sleeping, not eating being irritable. Acting a little bit irrationally umm… and then with many of the problem is of very small space of time with which any intervention can be made. I'm talking two or may be three days where they can come in with some antipsychotic medication or something like that and before I'm put in to hospital. 

00:19:45
DR. MEG SMITH You may not be able to recognize what's going on. I found that very difficult. I found it very difficult to sit here and say to you. Look I know a lot about what triggers of my episodes. I know what to do, but on the other hand you know given a certain period of time after stressful event I'm actually not capable of carrying it out. I have to trust somebody else and that's very difficult. It's very difficult for anybody to do say well they may come at time in the future where I'm not going to be able to have control of my life. Okay so the next best thing is to decide on you know one person or couple of people and tell them what's likely to happen and give them permission to help you out at that particular time. Well, let it out as a kind of contract you know if, if I'm not sleeping I'll give you permission to contact my GP or my health worker and I'll agree you know to do whatever you tell me to do at that particular time, I trust you to do that. And then I think it's pretty important, it certainly saved me for ending back in hospital quite a few times now. 

00:20:45
VICKI One of the interesting triggers was talking really, really fast. So it, it was very subtle and if you could pick it up quite early you would know at that time it was hard or my brother because I wouldn't believe him and I would say what are you talking about. I'm just confident and also I talk fast naturally. But he would find the subtlety and the other trigger was beginning to reduce my hours of sleep. So it will be very slight it might start off with five hours instead of seven. 

00:21:20
ROSS With some of the early warning signs like increased activity and irritability and of I… I would say yeah you know you carry out things faster you know that sort of thing. Well the trouble is with that those signs they you know you're already into the manic attack, you know what I mean you are sort of you've passed that point of no return. They’re not as easy to recognize, but the sleeping is you know that's one because of that's what grab at it because it's an early one. 

00:22:00
DR. MEG SMITH It seems to be the not sleeping that you know builds up the mania so if you can recognize that hey look you know what am I distressed my sleeping pattern start to get disrupted. Then may be one of the things that's important to do is to start to, to you know may be write down a list you know for a close friend to say look you know if I go for more than a couple of night without sleeping or if you’ve noticed you know we've noticed over the last week that my sleeping patterns are got shorter, shorter, and shorter then it's really important that I get some kind of medication to help me to sleep may be I get my lithium levels checked or what have you but you know may be we have got of sort of do something to make sure I get some sleep. 

00:22:40
ROSS When I went up to my son and said no I didn’t sleep and I thought no I can't, I'm not going to sleep the next night and that's what I might not need so take, take this Medrol and I slept you know. 

00:22:50
CHARLENE I know if me that if I start to take drugs again or if I feel the need to do that then I obviously know that something is going wrong because I self-medicate with drugs. So basically I take a lot of medication usually you know by taking drugs but um… it wasn't… it wasn't any… not long ago that I actually had a really heavy sting with drugs and I know that there was something going on then and I actually went and saw a psychiatrist after that and she put me on more medication um… but it's… if I feel the need to do that or if I find myself you know hanging out with people that I used to hang out within you know I'm just putting myself back into situations that were unhealthy for me I know that there is a problem. Also if I stop going to work or stop you know taking care of myself then I know that I am obviously not feeling too good about myself and that there is a problem. And I always if there is a problem, I get together with my um… mental health worker, we talk it through or I go and see a psychiatrist, I never just let myself go and see what's gonna happen, I never do that. 

00:24:00
DR. MEG SMITH People can prevent relapses. Okay, it might mean you know a few weeks of going back on to you know a different kind of medication or change in the medication or slowing down you a lot, but hey, that's gonna be a lot better than three months in hospital. 

00:24:15
Drugs and Alcohol 

00:24:20
GERALD It only takes one or two puffs of a joint and um… I'll get this instantaneous sort of… um… yeah, sort of really strong euphoria, um… it's… it's like a really strong fuzzy warm feeling you know it's, it’s really nice for me and that's the problem I have, I like smoking the stuff and a lot of people do, but um… the um… the outcome just isn't worthy you know um… just about every time I smoked it in the last three years, I have ended up in hospital almost every time um… maybe every time, maybe every time. 

00:25:00
DR. PHILIP MITCHELL I view marijuana as poison for somebody who has bipolar disorder. That might seem an extreme statement but I have seen so many people ah… with bipolar who just so rapidly go into a manic or depressed episode after taking marijuana. 

00:25:15
GERALD There is no doubt in my mind or anybody else is… that is the main reason just about the only reason I will become unwell in such a short space of time with cannabis it's just a big blower(ph) it just, it just happens… almost every night it's… it's scary. 

00:25:35
CHARLENE I was constantly depressed and tired. I couldn't motivate myself to do anything. And it was really scary. It wasn't just physically, it was… you know mentally used to really freak me out. I used to… in my thought, I was listening, I would see things all the time you know like silhouettes of people running in the… at night time especially and it was just really nerve-wracking I couldn't handle it and that was all brought on by this drug that I actually thought was taking these symptoms away. 

00:26:05
DR. PHILIP MITCHELL Some people just take small amounts and that precipitates an episode so that people have to… one who are in that situation have to understand that if they want to get their lives under control, then they might just have to stop taking that marijuana or control their alcohol use. 

00:26:20
ROSS I used to drink every day and then quite a bit… quite a bit and I miss it now, I miss it. I would like to… I would like to drink again but I can say you know it's… it's… it's one little problem for your brain, so I mean what… you know you don't really need to do. 

00:26:40
GERALD I was speaking to my case manager the other day about it. Actually and he was saying that I mean I said to him like I wanna… I wanna… thrush this out, I wanna say to you how many drinks do you think I can have you know, what’s the limit and he said okay, let's look at this way, maybe four, five beers in a night, spiced out. I think what he meant to say was just use your common sense. If you start to… to feel yourself getting a bit, you know, um… if you feel you get into the stage where you're losing a bit of reason, you know, that's a thing I've always got to have a bit of reason about me, if I'm… if I'm to succeed not having any dope. 

00:27:25
ROSS Yeah I can understand why people drink with mental illness. It's sort of you know when you say (inaudible ) it's like anybody else it's probably non-liquors(ph) you know, you sort of… you still got your mental illness and… and, and you got to hang on as well. 

00:27:45
Lifestyle 

00:27:50
DR. MEG SMITH I think being diagnosed with bipolar disorder creates some real dilemmas about how you are going to manage the rest of your life, okay, so maybe you can decide it's never gonna happen to you again and you think just go on the way you've been going. But I think most people who have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and have had a couple of fairly severe episodes that I’ve been pretty majorly disruptive in their lives, do have to make some decisions about the kind of lifestyle they are gonna lead. Um… and that might mean deciding that you simply can't cope with shift work or that um… you simply can't cope with a job that means you got to leave home at 5 a.m. in the morning or that you can't go to night clubs every night and dance the night away or that you can't stay a whole night writing essays. 

00:28:35
MARLENE It's just um… making sure I sleep well. And when I say sleep well, I mean like for me it's about 10 hours a night like it's not you know seven hours or whatever. I have to get a really good sleep. I have to eat well I'd… it's just about eating it's not so much the food I eat this is about eating regularly. Um… I have to eat morning, lunch, and finding a job was a big one for me. It was really hard for me to find a job because I had nearly no experience, I had nothing, but when I finally found one, it was one of the best things that ever happened. You know I finally had money to look after myself. 

00:29:15
DR. MEG SMITH Maintaining a sort of reasonably stable lifestyle is important for me. The people I live with are important too. I mean I have to live with a person who is a pretty regular kind of guy in terms of… you know meals are on-time, meals are regular. He has a sort of fairly… you know, fairly kind of you know regular routine and that really helps me. I think if I am living with people who themselves are chaotic, it's just sort of accentuate the chaos in me. 

00:29:40
GERALD The main thing that I like to do in my life is just um… a balance of everything, um… a bit of exercise the rhythmic sensation of running along on a… on a pavement. It's just very hypnotic for me and it just makes me, I can think about things in my head and it's healthy for me. Being healthy for me is important. Um… when I think about happiest times in my life it's always been the healthiest times in my life. I play a bit of organized sport on the weekends too. I know all the people there, I've been going for a number of years and it's… the familiarity of it all, it's very therapeutic for me to do… to do things like rugby and the running and things like that um… that fixed times during the week, because it just makes me feel safe. You know I mean I have had so many times in my life where um… I felt alone or scared or not safe. Also I'd just like spending times, just relax times with my friends and taking my dog for a walk. Just little things like that. I enjoy doing and reading and things like that. If I can do a little bit of each of those things every week, um… I'm… I'm… I'm a happy camper. 

00:30:55
CARLOS I swim. Yeah, it's great you know it helps me lose weight from the weight gain from the pills I've got to take. Um… keeps me fit, um… yeah, it's good. I've just started a yoga course. You know we deal with yoga stretches to stretch out your body. It gets rid of all the tension in your body. Um… yeah this is the other thing too. For me at least meditation is, if you can get to some course… so many different types of meditation and if you feel uncomfortable about it, it's not always about, people sitting in strange positions with their legs around their heads and there is a whole range of types that you can do you know ranging from the sort of new energy to the not so new energy um… um… and hence you got to get up there and look on them(ph) in the yellow pages and start ringing around and asking people and… 

00:31:50
DR. MEG SMITH There are fairly biased mood in the sense that not anybody can… I do find it difficult giving lectures at 8 am in the morning if I'm on medication. That's something I've had to work out with my supervisor at work. So I mean I do have to take responsibility to sort of say to my supervisor, look, I'm on medication at the present moment, I do get a medication hang over. I really don't function very well in the mornings when I'm on medication. But I'm happy to work in the afternoons and the evenings. Um… um… because I need you know to get a reasonable night sleep I can't work late one night and start early the next morning. Um… okay sometimes that's unavoidable in which case then I have to take the following day off to sort of recover, but um… it really does mean sort of working out how my job and the things I'm doing are affecting my mood and my mental state.

CARLOS Some people actually get a lot of therapeutic benefit out of having a dog or a cat, especially if they are living on their own. If you got a dog or a cat that you love, um… you know, I've heard people that said that they would stay well um… for the sake of their dog, because if they had to go to hospital a dog couldn't be fed you know simply stuff like that. 

00:33:10
Counseling 

00:33:10
DR. PHILIP MITCHELL In addition to the medications, it's important to be aware that many people will benefit from psychological treatment or counseling. The illness has a huge impact upon um… upon sufferer's self-esteem and confidence. 

00:33:25
CARLOS I… I could have done with um… some sort of counseling to help me with the… with the devastation of what it was like to go from being king of the castle to… to being a zombie in (inaudible ) because that is um… that is devastating. Um… yes you need the counseling to deal with a devastation of what it's done to your life and God, even my family could have done with some help. 

00:33:55
VICKI Seeing a counselor for me was amazing because of her style. She actually got angry with me one time because whenever she would say to me, why don't you go out and get your driver license, why don't you apply for you and do this, that's what you wanna do and I would always say but I'm a consumer, I can't do that, because I will get sick or no, no, that's not… not… offered. That's not allowed for me. There was always a block and I was afraid and she got really angry one day and said from now on every time you walk into my office, you leave your mental illness at the door, it can wait for you when you get home and you come in as Vicki. 

00:34:30
CARLOS From my experience, um… you need um… a balance of medication and counseling. If you just take the medication it's not good enough, you just take counseling and the brain chemistry goes high way than you… than you're stuffed. 

00:34:45
DR. MEG SMITH I think cognitive-behavioral therapy is one of the most effective counseling approaches for people with mood disorders because in effect, it sort of says, look, you know, don't believe everything you think because what you think is um… dominated really by the mood. Um… If I am depressed I believe that, um… I'm hopeless, I'm worthless and I will achieve anything. You know cognitive-behavioral therapy certainly helps in terms of um… looking at um… the reality of the thinking patterns. And certainly helps to work out, you know what's that impressive(ph) thought pattern, what's a manic pattern and what's a okay thought pattern if you like. 

00:35:25
Groups 

00:35:30
DR. MEG SMITH One other things I found after I was diagnosed was that um… I've never met anybody else with manic depressive illness I mean I probably had but I hadn't been open about it so they didn't(ph) told me about it but, I hadn't actually ever sat down and talk with somebody else who had been through similar kind of episodes to me. And I really wanted to meet with other people to sort of say well, did you have the same kind of symptoms? um… Did you take this meditation, how long did you take it for? Did it work? Did it not work? um… um… Did you recover? This is what I really wanted to know. 

00:36:05
CARLOS And find yourself a support group um… people don't go there to you know (inaudible ) just I look, we just exchange um… stories about you know, have you tried these meditation that's great. You know, oh I found a great doctor ah… where does he practice um… um… the fate of this hospital is bad don't go there. 

00:36:25
DR. MEG SMITH It was probably one of the sort of peak experiences in my life actually. I think the things are important for me was sort of recognizing that the symptoms I'd experience like being the Virgin Mary, being very grandeur, spending all my money. Being suicidal bla, bla, bla, everybody else had gone through. 

00:36:45
VICKI I was initially very scared of going there and I hardly spoke in the beginning because I was so, I've just been diagnosed, I was always getting unwell. But I couldn't believe in that support group there were people who had, there is a woman who had a Ph.D. and she was a professor and she was going to work every single day and when I talked to here and I heard her story. I, I realized that our stories are similar, she thought she was the Virgin Mary so did I. 

00:37:10
DR. MEG SMITH They've gone through, you know so you've been the Virgin Mary so what? So what? and it sort of normalized, it sounds funny to say, but it did normalize. It was like well okay, okay, so it's something that happens, you know people think they're Virgin Mary or Jesus Christ when they're manic okay, yes common sort of thing. Um… So it help me sort of recognize what the symptoms where and I guess it sort of it wasn't so horribly mean unique, one of the hopeful things about mental illness he's feeling is something peculiarly horrible about you. You know that you're the only one in the world who has ever gone through this terribly finding terribly sort of… terrifying sort of experience. It's somehow comforting to know that people have gone through it and they survived and they come out the other end. 

00:37:55
CARLOS And it's such a relief to know, that you're not doing this alone, you know because that makes it really hard. And especially for guys, because um… We don't talk about this. And we die from this. 

00:38:10
DR. MEG SMITH I mean the doctor can say, if you take this meditation this is what will happen. But maybe you don't believe it. Now I remember very clearly one woman who, who had been on lithium for years. And this was at a time when, you know bugged(ph) if was going to take lithium you know I mean, um… I was feeling really unique about taking it and but on the other hand pretty tough (inaudible ) and she had been talking it and there was no big deal. Um… and sure she was getting few side effect and she thought were fairly minor but, um… but it given her the security to sort you know raise her kids and um… you know sort of the confidence that, you know within a year she hadn't had a major episode. So that actually was one of the sort of key things in making me decide that well, okay you know, um… if I'm this worried about having other episode. Um… there is nothing too dreadful and awful about taking lithium, you know for a period of time. Um… until I'm sort of confident, um… I can discuss with the doctor about the possibilities of not taking it again. 

00:39:10
Family and friends 

00:39:10
Are you working(ph)? 

00:39:10
GERALD It sounds pretty good to me. When I'm sick, I tend to go and visit my friends and um… sometimes my family at um… very early times in the morning or late at night. Because some of full of energy I am zipping around everywhere you know it's um… it's a very awkward time for me and as a matter of fact it's put a bit strain on some of my friendships, um… my family. 

00:39:40
DR. PHILIP MITCHELL This is in essence a physical condition akin to diabetes, akin to a cancer or heart disease. Um… Now there are clearly factors that can make and behaviors that can make the condition better. Um… but in essence it's physical, think that's an important point. Um… because even carers and spouses those close to the individual um… can sometimes be stigmatizing, um… can some be putting the person down if they are not careful. So, I think to respect the fact that this is an illness now different to many other in medicine. 

00:40:10
DR. MEG SMITH I think family and friend are very important in term of providing supportive environments or providing some kind of stretch(ph) in the person's life. And it can't be very difficult to move from, um… looking after someone who is totally dependent as people often know when they're very depressed to, you know treating the person as a responsible adult and sort of get on with the rest of the life and what have you. Um… I think it's fairly important for family and friends to get information about just what manic depressive illness actually is, maybe talk with other family and friends, you know who have been through it. Um… and maybe negotiate with the person about what the person wants them to do or not to do. 

00:40:55
CHARLENE I think it's important that if you do notice something to say something and lot of the time you wonder if it's your place to say something and maybe you should leave it up to them. And I'm sometimes you get a negative response if you say something like that. But at least you've opened their eyes up to that. You know option like at least you said to them that will it will look… you know there is something that you can do about it. And obliviously if it go… if it went too far then I would actually make an appointment for them. 

00:41:20
DR. PHILIP MITCHELL Um… I think in general most people with the illness afterwards are pleased if they brought into treatment early. Now that's not always true because I've had some um… family members who say they've never been forgiven, um… for, um… getting the relative in contact with professionals. I think that's in general the minority. 

00:41:40
CHARLENE You may take my mom for example, sometime she got to the point where she didn't even, she was no longer in touch with the reality and she didn't know that there was something wrong, you know what I mean she thought anything was going well so how can someone except her to go and make an appointment when she thinks she's fine. So I mean that was you know my time to step in then. 

00:42:00
DR. MEG SMITH Maybe the best thing is, you know if the health worker, the person and you know a support person can get together and decide well okay um… what's happening at the present moment, what are the kind of supports that are going to be needed in the future? If there is a relapse who is going to do what you know, um… Is it possible for the person to be looked after at home? Should the person go to hospital? Um… you know what are the sorts of likely scenarios. Um… um… and I think, yeah I don't want to damage my relationships for example by being so sort of ill that um… it going to sort of damage my relationships, you know it's probably gonna be better for me to go to hospital be looked after professionally then to put too much strain on my existing relationships. 

00:42:50
GERALD There was the time there I was unwell. Well, I was in hospital three times in the space of about six months or something you know, but it was just crazy. And that's was my only cannabis related um… and yeah my, my family I think was starting to crack a bit, you know that the… the… the generous (inaudible ), you know it's just getting to the point where I didn't have any more reserves to call upon you know, and then I was just, um… um… yes starting to, to lose it a bit. But, um… but still managed to, to visit in hospital and that's important when you're in hospital if… if no one comes to see you, you get pretty dark on yourself. And ah… yeah, um… I mean my mom and my dad especially every day, same time it was really nice you know, you just you look forward to those little visits. 

00:43:55
What're large (inaudible ) 

00:44:00
DR. MEG SMITH I think the important thing to remember is that um… If you have a life, you can have a successful life with bipolar disorder. I remember after I was first diagnosed my partner took me out to dinner, really nice restaurant, we're sitting there looking out of the view. And I'm sitting there saying boohoo I've got bipolar disorder, this is the end of my life, yes I know it. I want to have you and I sort of stayed quite depressed actually for sort of few days. And then it sort of gradually sort of you know, went away and what have you. And after a period of time, I learned that in fact I could do the things I'd always done, in fact I could do more than I always done. Because now at least I had some mechanisms for ensuring that, you know the episodes of depression didn't go on forever. I could in fact prevent, you know some of these episodes from occurring. And actually had some control over my life. 

00:44:50
CARLOS You are more than you're illness. You are not manic depressive you know you are John Smith who is 33 year old who (inaudible ) who works at so and so, who's got two kids um… dog and few mates(ph) whatever that's you. And you happily have manic depression. 

00:45:15
CHARLENE You've just got to make sure that you, you know look after yourself. And if you feel like you're going down you could just got to remember which one is better, you know you're feeling well or you feeling low, you know and like you're not worth anything, which one do you prefer. I'll always choose feeling good about myself, so I constantly want to take care of myself you know. 

00:45:35
DR. PHILIP MIECHELL Bipolar disorder is a very treatable condition for the vast majority the commencement and the continuation of adequate and appropriate treatment just make such an enormous difference, um… and I've seen that with many patients that I've treated. That I view this optimistically this condition that although it's difficult and um… disorganizing and terrible condition that when the treatment is right it just make such an enormous difference. So I view this very optimistically. 

00:46:10
GERALD I think you always got to be conscious of this illness. Never really goes away completely. But you can, you can um… control it to the point where it doesn't, it doesn't control you, you control it. um… and well I've just, is there for you to take and experience. And it's um… It's a wonderful life yeah.
