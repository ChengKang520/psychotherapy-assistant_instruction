ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Hello. Did you know that approximately 500,000 children in the United States suffer from OCD? I'm Elizabeth DuPont Spencer from Rockville, Maryland, and with me is Kimberly Morrow from Erie, Pennsylvania. You can find us on our website, at the end of this talk, if you're interested in contacting us on the resource page. Kimberly, why don't you start us off by telling us a little bit about how you got started working with kids who have OCD? 

00:00:45
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. Well, first let me just say how excited I'm to be here today to umm… hopefully have all of you be along on our journey to educate as many clinicians as possible, to treat children those OCD. Umm… My first experience, and… and even beginning to understand OCD, was when I worked on a children's inpatient psychiatric unit, and there was a little girl, I think she was about eight years old, and she came to us, and she was just twirling, she was twirling round and round, and when we tried to understand why did she keep twirling, she said that she was afraid that if she stopped that she would then look at her friend's chest, and she was afraid that if she looked at her friend's chest then that would mean that she liked her friend and that she would wanna touch her chest. (inaudible ) she could think to do was to keep twirling so that she didn't have to umm… feel those awful feelings and think those awful thoughts. Umm… Now, she was hospitalized back, and this was almost 20 years ago, umm… she was hospitalized for two weeks on the inpatient psychiatric unit and given antipsychotic medications. And at one point, she said to me, "Kimberly, does anybody else have this?" And it was at that point that I began my journey to understand what was really going on with her and I discovered that she had Obsessive compulsive disorder, and I became committed to learning as much as I possibly could, so that other children didn't have to suffer like she was suffering. And the good news about that story is that, about a year ago, umm… she went back to college and, because she's now, I don't know how old she would be now, but she's a nontraditional student and she had my husband as a professor, and she went to him, and… and she asked if I was his wife, and she wanted him to share with me how well she was doing and how grateful she was that I found the right treatment for her and was able to help her. 

00:02:15
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yeah. Such a great a great story! It's such a great story to hear something like that. You know, I got started working with kids who have OCD umm… in a kind of a similar way that I came upon a kid with OCD and I had been trained to help adults with OCD, but I hadn't umm… had any experience working with kids. Umm… And this eight-year-old was sent to me by an adult psychiatrist, the mothers' umm… psychiatrist said to her, you need to get your daughter some help. And her daughter had… umm… had an experience where she was in her car seat, umm… and the mother was driving her along, and the daughter started yelling from the back seat, "I swallowed my zipper of my coat. I swallowed my zipper," which, of course, the mother was really upset about that and pulled the car over and tried to figure out what happened with the zipper, where did the zipper go, and of course, the zipper was right on the coat. Umm… But she took her daughter home, and… and her daughter was just inconsolable, kept saying, "I just swallowed my zipper." So the mother took her to the pediatrician, who looked at the daughter and the coat and said, "You're fine," and sent them home. 

00:03:10
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah. 

00:03:10
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER And… And, of course, the daughter was fine for a few days, and then, the mother was driving the daughter umm… during the day, needed to stop and get gas. And while she was at the gas station, again with the daughter in the back seat of the car, the daughter started yelling that she'd been drinking the gasoline that the mother was pumping. Umm… And the mother knew that it didn't make any sense, any of these things that her daughter was saying, but her daughter was just saying them so passionately that she knew she needed to do something to get help. Umm… So that was really my beginning of working with kids with OCD. 

00:03:45
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah. And I… I think it shows that, you know, OCD can get really crazy looking. And I think it overwhelms families, and it overwhelms clinicians, and so I just wanna say to everybody who's watching this through our webinar today, we're gonna give you as much information as we can possibly give you umm… in two hours, umm… and it's gonna to be enough for you to get started. But… But please look at the resources, contact us for supervision. We wanna help you feel comfortable treating this as much as possible. Umm… And… And hopefully, through this two-hour webinar, we're gonna give you lots and lots of examples so that you can feel more comfortable. Umm… But there's lots to know, and… and lots to figure out with OCD, because it's a… it's quite an interesting problem to have and, often challenges us as clinicians right? 

00:04:25
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Well, it presents itself in so many different ways. I mean, we're gonna talk about kids that so many different developmental levels today. And we're gonna talk about so many presenting symptoms of OCD. It's… It's really a lot to cover. As you say, we're… we're really giving people an idea about what to do, but… but all of you at home, we want you to look at this as a beginning, finding more information. We know that umm… usually umm… OCD starts in… in a kind of two separate sections of people's lives, either between the ages of eight and 12, or in the late teen years, but OCD can start any time during a person's life. And uh… we're gonna be talking today about kids all the way from preschool to late high school. 

00:05:00
KIMBERLY MORROW Right, right. I just rang the OCD support group last night, which is something I've been doing for about 20 years, and I have children and adults in the support group, and several of the adults were saying to the children that they wish that they had had treatment as a child, because their OCD definitely started as… as… a child, and nobody knew what it was. So, it can take up to 15 years before a person gets accurately diagnosed and treated with OCD. And… And you and I are passionate about making sure that those numbers change, right? 

00:05:30
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER We are. We are ready to have more clinicians learn how to competently and confidently treat OCD (inaudible ). 

00:05:36
KIMBERLY MORROW Well, let's get started with umm… understanding how to diagnose OCD. I think it's important, first and foremost, to understand that OCD is a neurobiological illness, and so it effects our behavior, that's what kind of our brain is glitched, and we're gonna talk more about that in… in a little bit. But, umm… when our brain is glitching, it sends us false information. It's our instinct to do something about it to feel better. And so then that behavior also becomes a problem, which is typically what we're all seeing and talking about. You know, when you're… you're having to go the doctor to see if there's a zipper your child's mouth, umm… right, umm… or a girl keeps turning over and over again. So, it's both a problem of the brain and the behavior. But I wanna make sure the clinicians can educate parents and children that this isn't anything that they have done, that has caused them to have OCD. This is a neurobiological illness. And, umm… that's what we're gonna treat it as such. I also wanna make sure that you understand that it umm… really becomes so excessive that it affects them typically umm… at home, for sure, and their family systems, we're gonna talk more about that and how to help the family system. Sometimes it affects their ability to do self-care. Sometimes it affects them at school, or with their friends, or to enjoy after-school activities. So, when OCD gets to the point where umm… it's effects… affecting the function in their life, that's when we know that it's really a problem for them. And oftentimes, OCD will start with one small thing. A child might say to me, I was fine until I watched, you know, Ranger Rick, and they had something about, you know, somebody getting lost, and then that's all I could think about was, what if I get lost. And so oftentimes, OCD will start with one trigger, and then, because you give it umm… some type of umm… action, you… you do something to feel better, then it kind of grows exponentially. So, those are just a few things I want people to know, as there're assessing and beginning to diagnose OCD. So, first let's talk about what obsessions actually are. Those are intrusive repetitive thoughts, urges, or images that cause significant distress, those are just not a little bit of anxiety. These kids are feeling anxiety at, you know, from one to 10, they're feeling it at a nine or 10, with many of these things by the time they come to you. Umm… These thoughts do not just excessively focus on real problems in your life. And kids, typically work really hard at suppressing or ignoring umm… these thoughts, urges or images. I… I had a boy in my office this week, who umm… every time he had a bad thought, I said, "Well, what do you do with that?" And he says, "I try to have a good thought." And I asked him, "Does that work?" And he says, "It works for a few minutes and then the bad thought comes right back." So that's what's really typical. The kids are trying to suppress umm… these thoughts, images or urges and they're unsuccessful in doing that. Umm… The other thing that's important to know is that kids may or may not know that their mind is simply generating these thoughts. They may really believe these thoughts. And so, another boy that I was treating when he umm… thought that bad things were gonna happen, he had to do certain things to make sure those bad things didn't happen. And I asked him, did he really believe he had that much power that he could prevent bad things from happening. And he said, absolutely, he did. Now, this was a 14-year-old boy. 

00:08:30
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Okay. 

00:08:30
KIMBERLY MORROW And I just wanna mention that he was also on the spectrum, so that may have had something to do with him being very concrete. But I think it's important that almost… always adults are able to say, this is the craziest thought, but I can't help it anyways. 

00:08:40
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Right. 

00:08:40
KIMBERLY MORROW But children, don't necessarily umm… know that, okay. 

00:08:45
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Right. And I think it's great to bring up the point about uh… autism, because certainly there is overlap between autism and OCD, were more people with autism have OCD than you'd expect, and more people with OCD have autism than you'd expect. Umm… And dealing with people who have autism, it's very important to stay concrete in what you're doing with, how you're teaching them how to deal with this particular problem. But it absolutely can help people with autism, the kind of techniques that we're talking about today. 

00:09:10
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah. And I'll try to, if I can remember, I'll try to bring it up when we get to the treatment part, and how I might do it a little bit different with someone who's on the spectrum. All right. So, let… So, let's talk a little bit about compulsions then. Compulsions are umm… the things that kids do to feel better. And by the way, this isn't just kids that are doing these things, its parents, anything that the parent does umm… to feel better, anything you, as a therapist, does. I… I once had a boy, who was afraid that he was homosexual, and he… I was his therapist, and he just started with me, but he'd been seeing a psychiatrist, who's given him medication, and every time he went to the psychiatrist, she would say compulsively, "Do you think I'm gay? Do you think I'm gay?" And I asked him, "Well, how did the psychiatrist respond?" And the psychiatrist kept saying, "I'm sure that you're not gay. I know that you're not gay." So, even a psychiatrist was involved in having compulsions with this uh… teenager, okay. So, compulsions are excessive and repetitive ritualistic behaviors that a child feels they must perform or something bad is going to happen. So, you guys have heard, you know, some of the different things, hand-washing, counting, silent mental rituals. In fact, this came up with the support group last night again. We had a… a 13-year-old girl, coming for the first time, and she was trying to tell her parents that she didn't have OCD, because she didn't have any compulsions. And so when I asked her, umm… what kinds of fears and thoughts she had, umm… she was sharing those with me. And then I said, "So, you know, what do you do to feel better?" And she says, "I just pray in my head to make them go away." So to her, that wasn't a compulsion, but that was something that she did in her head to try and make the umm… obsessions and fears go away. So, it's important that you know that even if kids say they don't have compulsions then you're also looking at, are there any mental rituals they're doing. And some kids will say, "No, you know, I don't have any anxiety about this at all." But that's because their parents are doing so many things to make sure that they feel okay about their obsessions. So it's important to understand even what teachers might be doing to get involved in the child's compulsions. So these rituals often happen at least one hour or more per day. And did you wanna say something? 

00:11:10
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER No, I was just thinking about how the parents feel like they're helping the kid. They feel like they're like… like the psychiatrist, I sure, felt like he was helping the kid saying, "I'm sure you're not gay." Or the pediatrician in the example… 

00:11:20
KIMBERLY MORROW Yes. 

00:11:20
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER …that I used for the girl who swallowed the zipper, he felt like he was doing the right thing. And… And it's the hardest thing for parents and for professionals to realize that all that reassurance, all of that feeding into the compulsions, that's just creating more problems for that particular child. Sure, it helps in that moment, and that's the thing about compulsions, they are powerful, because at that moment that you do that compulsion, whuh… the anxiety level goes down, the OCD goes away, and so you feel like, ah… here's the solution to this, and that's what keeps you coming back for more. And the adults are really pulled into it just as much as the kids are. I think it's great that you bring that up, Kimberly. 

00:12:00
KIMBERLY MORROW Right, because I think it's our instinct to do whatever we can so that we don't have to feel bad, and OCD, feels really, really bad. So people do really, really big things in order to, you know, manage those severe anxiety feelings. And so, that… that's pretty much what compulsions umm… are about. And… And I wanna add something to the diagnostic piece, because I think it's important when you work with children to understand something called PANDAS or PANS. And so, PANDAS is Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Strep. You can see why they called PANDAS, because nobody can remember that. I even had to read that out. Umm… So, what that means though is that the strep infection confuses the child's immune system into attacking their brain, instead of attacking the infection. And so, these kids typically start out with maybe or hardly any anxiety, and then they get sick, and the parent will say, "Oh my gosh, all of a sudden things just went from zero to a 100! Things got so crazy!" Umm… And these kids are obsessing like crazy and compulsive like crazy, and it's a really severe experience of OCD. Now, PANS is the same thing. It's called Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome, and the only difference is that there's also other infections, the flu, pneumonia, umm… different infections can cause these severe OCD symptoms. And by the way, they can also cause other symptoms, uh… (inaudible ), umm… tics, umm… ADHD. We're just gonna focus on OCD. But I just want you all to know that if you treat children with OCD, you will most likely come across some with PANDAS or PANS, and typically what you want is to make sure the pediatrician, umm… has information about this, and you can go to the International Obsessive Compulsive Foundation and just search for PANDAS or PANS, and you'll get a great umm… PDF of information, everything you, and the family, and the pediatrician would need to know to test for this, because we want to see if there's an active infection going on. If there is, they would need to be on antibiotics. And some children end up being on antibiotics for a prolonged period of time. Often times, these kids' symptoms are so severe, that they also need to be on medication. So the medication we're gonna talk about a little bit is called an SSRI or Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It helps balance their serotonin, so that it quiets those levels of anxiety, so that you can actually engage them in the exposure and response prevention treatment. Umm… So, with someone with PANDAS or PANS, they're gonna need everything on board. They're gonna need a psychiatrist on board, their pediatrician on board, you on board, they're gonna need antibiotics and SSRI and therapy. So, that's just really important. If you have further questions about that, again, feel free to contact us, because it can get a bit overwhelming. Umm… I've been thinking about a particular three… Well, again, very, very young kids can have this kind of severe symptoms with PANDAS or PANS. And I remember, a three-year-old, umm… a pediatrician umm… called me, because this three-year-old was convinced that her… umm… ceiling in her house was gonna cave in. 

00:14:55
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Oh! 

00:14:55
KIMBERLY MORROW And she screamed for so long, wasn't sleeping at night that the dad had erected pillars throughout their house to convince the three-year-old that their ceiling wasn't going to fall down. That's how extreme this can get with these kinds of cases, okay. 

00:15:15
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Okay. So, thinking about assessment. 

00:15:20
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah. So… So, one of the things I wanna say about assessment is, I'm… I'm a therapist who doesn't use assessment tools very often. I'm just gonna be honest about that. But when it comes to OCD, I always use an assessment. And there's… there's two different ones that we think are really good, one is Jonathan Grayson's obsessions and compulsions checklist, and we're giving you umm… on the PowerPoint here, his website freedomfromocd.com, and you can look at it to see if you like that one. The other one is called the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. And I'm gonna put it in front of umm… this so you can see what it looks like. And so, what happens is, umm… is that you're gonna use this to go through with the child and their parents. By the… By the way, let me make sure that you understand it. When you're assessing a child for OCD please in… involve the parents. Make sure… I don't care if it's a teenager, a three-year-old, an eight-year-old, it's really important to have parents involved in umm… understanding what kind of symptoms, the severity of the symptoms, and how it's affecting their functioning. So, in our first umm… session, I'm gonna bring out, typically the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, and I'm just gonna read through the typical symptoms that a child with OCD might have. So here are just some of the categories. Contamination obsessions, aggressive obsessions, it's important for all of you to know that umm… skids can have fears about harming other people, they can also have fears about harming themselves. And typically, again, it's Egodystonic, and that's a really important word umm… for us to teach you about. Umm… OCD, people know that this isn't true, but they can't help it anyways. Now, I said to you before that sometimes children have a hard time understanding that, but if they're having fears of harming themselves, oftentimes they'll say things like, "I can't stop thinking that I'm going to umm… use that knife and hurt myself, but I don't want to hurt myself, Kimberly. But I can't stop thinking that I am gonna hurt myself." So that's Egodystonic. If someone is actually suicidal, they'll be Egosyntonic, which means that they're thinking about it, and wondering about it, and trying finding a way to get a knife into the room so that nobody knows about it. And so, it's a very different feel when something is Egodystonic and there's anxiety experience attached to that, okay. So, that's another category of obsessions. Another one might be sexual obsessions. Again, with OCD, it's very typical, but OCD umm… comes on in areas that we're vulnerable, and it's oftentimes the opposite of what people are. So, if someone is worried that they're gonna harm someone, typically that person wouldn't ever wanna harm a flea, okay. But teenagers who are going through puberty, they might develop sexual obsessions that they maybe wanna have sex with their parents or that they are homosexual instead of heterosexual or that they've done some horrible things sexually and they'll… they'll never be able to stop feeling guilty about it. Umm… So these are all really typical categories of obsessions for children. But if you didn't go through these… umm… these checklists with the kids, you might miss this, and they may never want to talk about it, because it is so embarrassing for them. Do you wanna speak to that at all, Elizabeth? 

00:18:20
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yeah, that's what I wanted to speak too, because I think about a client that I worked with, Joe, who was 14 years old, and uh… He was from a Catholic family. He went to a Catholic high school, and he had scrupulosity, uh… which means that his OCD really revolves around fears of doing something that was religiously a sin. Umm… He had a… a fear that he was gonna do something that would be a sin and he would not be able to go to heaven. And it was a powerful feeling that Joe had. It was really an overwhelming feeling. Now, Joe came into me, having been already diagnosed with OCD, and on… already on an antidepressant, on an SSRI, umm… but… but still, he didn't wanna talk about any of the kind that… He wanted to be able to say, its scrupulosity. And when we through that CY-BOCS, and went down the list, the relief on his face of knowing, this was just one of the categories. 

00:19:15
KIMBERLY MORROW Yes. 

00:19:15
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER And there were all these other categories. He didn't have those other categories, but he has this category, and this is a known category. So, it… it was, to me, extremely valuable experience to go through the process of asking all those questions. I have other people that I work with, who wouldn't wanna bring up something particularly sexual as a… as one of those concerns that people have. And I think, particularly, that fear of being gay is one that's very hard for people to say, and going through that CY-BOCS is really normalizing for people. So, I agree with Kimberly, for… for OCD, it's really important. And it's important for the parents to hear too, these are just standard things that happen with OCD. 

00:19:50
KIMBERLY MORROW Right, right. And then, I use that CY-BOCS to develop the treatment plan. So later on we're gonna talk to you about developing hierarchies, and you'll see, how once you know which categories of obsessions they have and compulsions, then umm… you can rank… order those, to see which ones have the most anxiety attached to them and which ones have the least anxiety. And then, finally, there's a scaling score that goes from zero to 40, and I really love using that, because if a child is very high, let's say they're 35, the very first time I see them, every month or so, I'll go back and get that scaling umm… part out, and we'll reassess how severe their symptoms are. And it's really important that children have concrete evidence as often as possible that they are getting better, because they may still have symptoms, but when they see their number, the severity of their symptoms going down, to 25, to 15, they get really proud of themselves. And that then helps your treatment continue on in a positive way. Umm… And then the last thing, I just wanna make sure is that, as I'm assessing them, I'm really looking to understand their vulnerability. Umm… Although we're asking them the content of their obsessions, I really wanna make sure that, as therapist, you don't focus too much on the content, because it really isn't… If they've got scrupulosity, this really isn't about God. Or if they are afraid they're homosexual, this really has nothing to do with being homosexual, it more has to do with their inability to handle, umm… sometimes it's discomfort, sometimes it's things not being just right, sometimes it's uncertainty or distress. And I'm thinking again, just because I just had my OCD support group the last night, umm… I'm thinking about a girl who umm… was there and she had Body dysmorphic disorder, which is a form of OCD, which is focused on a part of your body. And she was obsessed with her eyelashes, and she had to put mascara on for hours a day until it was just perfect, because she kept thinking that her eyelashes were deformed. Umm… And so, someone had suggested, in the group, that why don't she just go without mascara for a while. And so, from our last script, she actually did do that. She decided for a weekend, she's was gonna go without mascara, and she actually did very, very well. But then the dad said, "Yeah! But then as soon as you put mascara back on, you are wreck. You were doing it for hours." And so, what I wanted to explain to them is that's because it really wasn't about the mascara, it was about her ability to practice doing things that didn't feel right to her. So she had to keep putting mascara on until it felt right, until she could see that her eyelashes weren't deformed. Well, she was never going to be able to see that her eyelashes weren't deformed. So, her… her true therapy was gonna have to be more related to practicing things where she could handle, having things feel not right, and having things look deformed. Does that make sense to you? 

00:22:30
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Absolutely. 

00:22:30
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. So that's why, you know, as you're assessing, you're not just focused on the content, but you're trying to understand their vulnerability. 

00:22:40
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Absolutely. Okay. 

00:22:40
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. 

00:22:45
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER So, thinking about the brain, using kids' language. So, this to me, where it gets exciting, working with treating kids, because umm… we can sit here and kind of in an intellectual way talk about what it means to have OCD. But how you'll explain this to a five-year-old? How do you explain this to a ten-year-old? And… And we saw again, from the numbers that eight to 12, that's the common age when that starts. So, it's really important to be able to explain this to kids. Now, cognitive behavioral therapy works to change your thoughts and your behaviors, and that is what's gonna change your feelings about things. With cognitive behavioral therapy, it's very important to do homework. We've heard Kimberly talk about her home… the homework of a girl, and the session was not feel like putting on her mascara. It's important to have a homework between sessions that you're gonna do. And one thing that we know is that people who write down their homework, get about 10% better from people who don't write down their homework. So, I'm putting this all in a context of how I like to package this for kids and families to make it accessible, and make it so that kids are likely to be on board and interested in doing their homework. This is never gonna work, if it's me saying to a kid, here's what you have to do, and it's the opposite of what you wanna do. It always has to be, this is a collaboration, this kid is an expert in his or her anxiety… his or her OCD, I am an expert, and what to do about treating anxiety and OCD. But I don't know this particular kid. We have to have a collaboration. We have to work together. So, from the beginning, I want them to be involved with explaining to me what it's like to be inside their brain. So, I like to start by having kids use a notebook. And I have… I give kids just a plain regular spiral bound notebook. And the first page that I like to start is what's my OCD story? Now, this obviously depends incredibly on what the age is of the kid. So if you've got a younger kid who can't write down things, I would have the parent write this down, and I would have the kid draw a picture. Umm… Many kids wanna put a few words down or they might want me to write something down. This is not a dear diary, where it's a private experience, and we're locking it away in a… in a cupboard somewhere, not to have anybody share it. Again, it's a collaboration, that notebook, between me, the child and the parent. So we like to start up with, what is my OCD story, because typically, ah… people will have an OCD story. You know, I think about Joe, who I just talked about before, Joe started off ah… when he was five years old, having to order everything in his room. He couldn't have any of his friends come into his room, because he couldn't stand to have them move things around. His parents had to not have the cleaners go into his room. And we're not talking about a kid who kept things messy, no, Joe with an incredibly organized, tidy, five-year-old. And… And he realizes that now when he looks back on it that that was a moment that he and his parents could have noticed that there was something going on, and then when he was in eighth grade, he became incredibly obsessive about the food that he ate. He only ate healthy food and would go a long way to avoiding anything that he perceived as dangerous. So, writing down the OCD story is kind of a way for people to begin to say, "Oh, this is a theme in my life. It's had different topics depending on what age I am, what developmental level I'm at." But here are the different kinds of thing… ways that it has… has I have experienced it. Then I like to talk about, why CBT? Okay. Why a cognitive behavioral therapy? Cognitive behavioral therapy is gonna ask you to do things that you don't feel like you should be doing. And it's really important to explain to kids, this is a therapy that has been used for a lot of years, and it's been found to be incredibly effective. In fact, this cognitive behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention or CBT with ERP, that we're talking to you about today, that's been found to be affective treatment in about 65 to 80% of kids. So, it's really an effective treatment. It also actually changes the way your brain works. So your brain works better once you've gone through this kind of therapy. It's not stuck the way it is with the OCD thoughts. So… 

00:26:50
KIMBERLY MORROW And… And I find that kids really love to know about how the brain works and that it affects their brain. So, I'm glad that you're bringing that up. 

00:26:55
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Absolutely, absolutely. Umm… So, and matter of fact that's my next page, my brain is anxious, okay. My brain is anxious. So, what do we do about this brain being anxious? Well, what I like to do… Kimberly talked about these are biological, neurobiological illness. This is a neurobiological illness. And I like to illustrate that really clearly to families by drawing a picture of a brain. Now, all of you at home, probably have the feeling right now the way most of my clients do when I suggest this to them. "Oh, no! That's gonna be too hard. Oh, no! I hope she doesn't expect me to do that." And I want you to understand, I'm not an artist and I'm not a PhD neurologist. I do understand what happens with the brain and anxiety, and I've developed a little way to illustrate it and explain to people what's going on with the brain. And I would encourage you to develop your own way to draw something or hand something to your clients, because I think this of a fundamental importance that people understand, there is a brain basis to this problem. So, here's my drawing. I take my paper and I draw a thought bubble, okay. It's a very bad drawing of a brain, but that's okay, because again, it's not about being perfect, it's about getting the information across. So, the front part of our brain is the cortex. This is the front part of our brain. We have attribution of meaning. We think things through with this part of our brain. That is a very important part of what's going on, but it is not where the problem with OCD lies. So, the problem with OCD lies, down here at the base of the brain, with amygdala, the thalamus, and the hypothalamus. Okay. Now I'm gonna show it to you, okay. So, I've put those three pieces of brain down. I've got the cortex. And here's the story. The story is, everything that we experience, everything that we feel, everything that we know in the world, comes up our brain stem, comes up our spinal cord, and hits the thalamus. And the thalamus does a quick sort and it says, "Hah, I wonder if this might be dangerous?" And it sends a message to the amygdala, "Hey amygdale, do you think this might be new? Might this be dangerous?" And then it also sends a longer message to the cortex, "Hey cortex, consider this, do you think this might be dangerous? The amygdala sends a fast message to the hypothalamus. And amygdala can only do one or two things. Yes, it's new and dangerous or no, it's not new and dangerous, that's the choice that the amygdala has. We know, and people who have OCD, the amygdala is overactive. And so what we've got is the amygdala sending a message to the hypothalamus and saying, "Yes, this is dangerous! Watch out! This is something bad!" And the hypothalamus sends a cascade that floods our body with adrenaline. So now you've got the fight or flight reaction going on. "Oh, no! We've gotta get out of here. This is terrible." And, if you think about it, our brains develop back when we were primitive hunter-gatherers. I always think it's so amazing to think about the fact that our early ancestors survived the Ice Age, and that fight or flight reaction, would have been a big part of helping keep us safe, but it's gotten an error in it with OCD. And, you can see that when you realize that the cortex meanwhile has been thinking about this and sends a message back to the amygdala saying, "Hey, it's not a problem. You don't have to worry about that." But meanwhile, this whole cascade has happened, because this piece, this thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, that happens just like that, okay. This front part, this is the cognitive part of what we're doing, the cognitive part, and this is the behavioral part, back here, of what we're doing. So, those are some of the ways that I like to explain this to parents. Now, you'll say, "What do you do with a five-year-old when you're trying to draw this thalamus drawing?" And, of course, the five-year-old isn't gonna really understand what's happening with that drawing. But you know what, the parents will. And there's something that happens that's very profound, when a parent gets the point, "Oh, I can kind of see what you're talking about… about this." But they give that message to the kid, "Oh, even if I don't completely understand it, my mom understands it, and that makes it important for me." So, I do tend to draw those with everybody. I do get a lot of looks from people who say, "Is that really something that we need to know?" And I say, "I think it is important to understand the beginning parts of that." 

00:31:20
KIMBERLY MORROW Can I add something to it, Elizabeth? 

00:31:25
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Please. 

00:31:25
KIMBERLY MORROW One the things that I say to… to kids and… and their parents is that, because of that overactive amygdala, and it sending, yes, this is dangerous, and a flood of chemicals go through, the child and the parents automatically respond… 

00:31:35
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yes. 

00:31:35
KIMBERLY MORROW …to those huge messages they're getting, umm… and because they respond, they're actually connecting that circuit and they're giving the information back to that part of the brain that says, this really is dangerous, because we have to do something about it. We have to count five times. We have to reassure the child or we have to check their homework over and over and over again. Umm… It's… It's their response to that overactive amygdala that actually umm… connects the circuit and tells the amygdala something must really be bad. So, umm… it's really important, you know, that we teach them through that brain information that we have to change how they respond to their amygdala. 

00:32:10
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Right, exactly. And… And to change how they respond to their amygdala, we're asking them to do something that they're gonna be finding hard to do. 

00:32:20
KIMBERLY MORROW Yes. 

00:32:20
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER And… And… And I have the utmost respect for the fact that that brain biology was designed to keep us safe, and that overriding it, is not something we do lightly. So, I… I go through that whole process of explaining why it's a false alarm, and then talking about the fact that we're gonna have to override it by doing the things that it tells us not to do. We don't have to do that all at once, but I… again, I think, laying that foundation of why it is we're explaining to them that they need to do the thing that they feel like they can't do, I think is so important. 

00:32:55
KIMBERLY MORROW So, let's talk a little bit about how we talk with children about it, because we like to use metaphors quite a bit, and I think, kids understand things better when we use metaphors. So, one of the things we talk about is being a brain glitch or brain trick. And sometimes that, you know, if once they're, you know, involved in treatment with me, a child will say, "Ah, that was just my brain glitch going!" Umm… So you know that they kind of understand that this their brain producing a false thought. And that's a really great place for the child to be. Another thing I often do is that, I'll… I'll say to kids, ah… in front of their parents, "So what do you do when the smoke alarm goes off in your home?" And they kind of sheepishly look at their parents like, "Can I really tell her the truth?" And I'll say, "Yup, yeah, tell me the truth." And… And the child will say, "Well, we don't do anything. Our… Our mom just waves a beautiful plate in front, or dad takes the battery out." And I'll say, "So, why don't you do anything?" And… And they'll say, "Because it's always that somebody's burnt the pizza. So we know not to preek(ph) out over it." So, I use that, because I say, "Well, the same thing is happening with your amygdala. Your amygdala is sending out a smoke alarm and saying, ah, something's wrong, but really nothing is wrong. And so I wanna be able to teach you how to have that same response, which is, ah… just to take a few breaths and not do anything about it, so that you don't connect that circuit in your brain. And that the more you can practice, having the same response to your brain, as you do to a smoke alarm, the sooner that you're going to get better." And then the another one that we use as a bully. Do you want to talk about how you talk about as a bully? 

00:34:20
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Well, (inaudible ) about the bully, because I'm gonna talk about how I use a different phrase for the bully. Go ahead. 

00:34:25
KIMBERLY MORROW Oh! Okay, okay. So, then, I… I love using the idea of a being a bully, because one, we know that OCD really tries to get us where we're growing up old, and so things that are really important to us, if my… if I'm, you know, ten years old and my friends are so important to me, umm… OCD might say to me, "You know, you just said something nasty to your friends and they hate you." Umm… And so, OCD is very much like a bully, and then it really tries to poke at you, and to see if they can get a response to you. So, I really work with kids, I'm trying to understand that the bully is just trying to mess with you, and it wants to see what kind of response it can get. And if you give it a response, if you cry, if you scream, if you do what it tells you to do, the bully only gets more powerful, and it's gonna come back and mess with you again tomorrow on the playground, right. But if you ignore it, if you say, "I can handle you. Well, I don't care what you're telling me. I can handle it", the bully finds somebody else to bother. And that's very similar to OCD. 

00:35:20
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Absolutely. And you notice that we're using language, that we're putting in kid language because, really what we're talking about is the amygdala. So, we're really talking to the kid and saying, "Here, you have to start ignoring your amygdala, or talking back to your amygdala." But, really, the image of the bully is a better one. I like to use a very specific image and that's why(ph) I used the image of you having an imaginary dragon in your head. So, I have (inaudible ) lovely dragons in my office that I use very effectively with kids as well as adults. And the point that I have about this is that whether we're talking about a bully, or we're talking about a dragon, or we're talking about amygdala, these are powerful feelings that our body is generating, and giving it some word that is not us, that is other than us, is tremendously important. So, you've… you're heard us talking so far about where we've come with understanding (inaudible ) says with OCD, going through that evaluation with a CY-BOCS, or some other checklist umm… with a kid, and now beginning to educate the kid about this topic, this is all in our first session that we're going through with the kid. 

00:36:25
KIMBERLY MORROW Yes. 

00:36:25
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER And it is amazing, how much better a person can be, after a first session, having had that experience of going through and learning this new information, about what is going on in their head and why they're doing the things that they're doing. 

00:36:35
KIMBERLY MORROW I just wanna highlight two things, Elizabeth. 

00:36:40
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yeah. 

00:36:40
KIMBERLY MORROW One is, umm… I… I always have a child decide what they wanna call it, because calling it OCD or anxiety or anything like that, umm… just is too awkward for a kid. And they don't wanna go to school and say to their, you know, teacher about OCD, but they call up Fred, well, Fred just doesn't seems overwhelming to them, and Fred's kind of fun. So, umm… when you're talking to the child and educating them about their brain, make sure that you give them some time to figure out what kind of name… And they may need a whole… You know, you might say, "Well, think about between now and my next session." 

00:37:05
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Great. 

00:37:05
KIMBERLY MORROW The other thing is, I typically do talk about the role of medications when I'm talking about the brain. And so, I said before, SSRIs help balance serotonin. Umm… I find, and I don't know your experience Elizabeth, umm… that rarely do I need a trial to go on medication, unless again it's a case of PANDAS or PANS, umm… sometimes when a child's going through puberty and their symptoms are really, really severe because of the added hormones, umm… but oftentimes, I really try to treat a child without medication first, because kids get better really fast. 

00:37:35
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yeah. 

00:37:35
KIMBERLY MORROW And once kids understand this, and they're like, "Oh my gosh! I just gotta not listen to my brain." Umm… They're able to do the therapy and get better. So, it's typically only when the child is trying to do the therapy and they're not able to do, I begin to recommend medication. But I do explain that there is medication, and we always have other things up our sleeves to help them get better. 

00:37:55
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER I agree with that. I also think that… that a difference for me would be, if I have a kid who's out of school, because of OCD. 

00:38:00
KIMBERLY MORROW Definitely. 

00:38:00
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER That, I would definitely say, "Let's move more quickly into thinking about medication," because I… I just wanna bring everything to bear. We know that with kids who are out of school due to OCD, the sooner we can get them back into school the better. Umm… We can fix a lot of the pieces that are going on that are the problems, once they're back in school, but we don't want them falling any further behind, and they already aren't getting any further out of step socially than they already are because they have been out of school. We gotta talk about schools a little bit later. 

00:38:30
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. 

00:38:35
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Okay. So, treatment. 

00:38:35
KIMBERLY MORROW Well, do you wanna talk about developing a hierarchy or… Let's just start a little bit with explaining what exposure and response prevention is. 

00:38:45
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Okay. 

00:38:45
KIMBERLY MORROW So, right here, on the… on the PowerPoint, we talk about exposure therapy. And so, really what we're asking children to do is to make a list of things that trigger their OCD, and then we rank order them, and we ask them to start with a thing that causes the least amount of anxiety, and actually start practicing doing it. So, we actually do the opposite of what they've been doing for as long as they know, and… and what the parents have been having them do. Typically, the parents have been helping them feel better and avoid the triggers. We're gonna actually try to help them walk towards their triggers and do things that actually trigger their amygdala to say, "Wait a minute, this is dangerous," okay. So, exposure therapy is teaching kids to walk into the thing that triggers them and response prevention is teaching them to do nothing, okay. And that… And by doing nothing, that… their brain says, "Okay, wait a minute, I must have been wrong about this, because you're not doing anything about my signal that I'm sending you." And then it will learn eventually umm… to not give you that same signal, okay. So, that's what exposure therapy is. And Elizabeth, I'm gonna let you talk a little bit about to start developing that hierarchy. 

00:39:50
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER So, a hierarchy, as Kimberly said, begins with the things that you know from the CY-BOCS. But one of the things that's important to understand is that not every OCD feeling is the same level of intensity. I mean, it likes you to think about whether you thought the bully or the dragon. The bully or the dragon, it wants you to think that being there, having that OCD thought, having that OCD compulsion, that's the problem, that's terrible, but really, it's on a hierarchy. So, we have zero, which is no OCD thoughts or feelings, and ten, all the way to the very worst, OCD panic that you can possibly have. And… And we look at it uh… with younger kids as a… as a thermometer, so that's something that a lot of kids can… can have a visual in their mind of, what would a thermometer look like, zero to the 10 with their OCD. Umm… Sometimes with little kids, I'll do small, medium, and large, instead of doing ah… any numbers, if they're really too young to have numbers be part of what their… way they're thinking about this. But those numbers are gonna be then very important in developing a hierarchy, because, no matter how many people you've treated with a particular kind of OCD, every single person is gonna have their own variation on what their hierarchy looks like. So, I wanted to give the example of Joe. So, I remember he's the one with scrupulosity, the 14-year-old. And when I first started working with Joe, umm… he had a list for me that was one or two level of anxiety, of OCD. I was talking with his friends, a four or five was he's bored and he's having OCD thoughts, a seven, within class, with those thoughts. And again, remember that Joe goes to a Catholic high school. Joe had been a very good student in middle school, but when he got to high school, umm… he was just overwhelmed by these thoughts, and he described what it was like sitting in class and trying to concentrate on a lesson with this bombarding thoughts with him all the time. I mean, it really sounds like it was a very difficult situation. For some reason, for Joe, working out, exercising increases OCD. So that was an eight or a nine. And the very worst one was the idea he had that if he had a new OCD thought, that would be something he couldn't manage. So that was something that he thought would be a ten for him. So we went through and developed a hierarchy. What are those OCD thoughts that you have? What are those situations that are difficult? Because we always wanna give people the opportunity to decide what level begin your exposure. And… And again, this is a kind of an interesting one too, because most people do better with beginning with the lower levels of their hierarchy, and start doing some practice at that lower level. I always like to have people predict, "Okay, how much OCD do you think you're gonna have? Zero to ten before you do this." So, if it's not washing your hands, uh… how much OCD do you think you're gonna have and then touching other things in the office? Perhaps not something we might do in the office. How much OCD do you think they'd have? People predict something, and then we go and try it and see is the level same(ph) what you think it's gonna be? That again is a very powerful piece of information, because the OCD doesn't want you to see that you can predict it and then you could be right or you could have overpredicted it, which is usually what happens for people when they're doing their practice. 

00:43:00
KIMBERLY MORROW (inaudible ) I'm gonna just highlight that, because I find that anticipatory anxiety is the… the worst severity of anxiety for uh… these kids. And so, if I can just get them to kind of take… take and put their toe in the water, you know, so to speak, umm… almost always I can get them to do more and more and more. So, it's… it's the idea that I'm gonna to have to do an exposure that overwhelms them, and oftentimes you really just have to get started with something very, very, very small and then they're gonna be able to umm… go a little bit further. An example that I use with that is I… I had a teenager who umm… had… had to sleep over at his friend's house, and he developed the fear that he was gay, and he wanted to have sex with his friend, but he couldn't tell me about that, it was way too embarrassing to him and overwhelming to him. And so, I knew that his OCD was really… he was struggling with it a lot, but he wasn't able to share with me. Why? So, literally, I had to take it down to the place of, you know, "Could… Could you write it out for me?" And he said, "No, I can't write it out for me." And I said, "Well, could you umm… could you text it to me?" Well, he didn't think could text it to me. I said, "Could you just text the first letter of the first word to me?" And he said, "Well, okay. I guess I can do that." And so, I knew that once I could get him just to do that piece of it, he might be able to do more of it. And so that that's true, that is what happened. He was able to test… text the word… the letter G to me. And then when he left that session, I said to him, "I'm wondering if when you get back home, if you might challenge yourself to text a little bit more to me?" And when he got home, he texted everything to me. So all I needed to do was kind of get him over that hump of the anticipatory anxiety of how… how awful it might feel to tell it to me, and what he found out was it… it was actually a relief to tell me. 

00:44:40
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yeah. The… This is so important about exposure. It… It sounds like it's gonna be torture. And it's very hard. It's not that we're saying that it's not hard, but the anticipatory anxiety is the worst part of OCD. And really people begin to learn, "I just need to jump in and do whatever that thing is." So, again, we like to start with lower levels. I like what Kimberly says, just the first letter of the word that's involved. Start with something that's a lower level thing to do, and have that person feels some success with doing that. One of the… the ways that OCD wins is because it's constantly getting people to think, "Well, I still have so much more to accomplish before I'm really well from this problem." And it's very important to begin to have people say, "Look, having come this far, on this problem, that's important to look back and see how you've progressed." Umm… So, for Kimberley's kind of, being able to say that first letter, that's a huge hurdle for him. And people are constantly downplaying that kind of a… of an example. They're constantly saying, "That wasn't very hard," or "Somebody else could have done that with no problem." And I say, "We all have different things. We all have different vulnerabilities. We all have things that are differently difficult for us. This thing was difficult for you, and you wanna give yourself credit for doing it." 

00:45:55
KIMBERLY MORROW So I wanna just comment on something that you're demonstrating right now, Elizabeth. And I think… I… I hope that all of you watching this can see the energy that Elizabeth and I have for treating kids with OCD. And I think it's really important. I think it's part of why we're so successful, umm… that we get excited for kids and the tiniest things, we are cheerleading them, we are high-fiving them, we are rewarding them, umm… anything that they do that helps them walk into these really uncomfortable places, we really are finding a way to celebrate. And umm… So, I just think it's important, if you are therapist and you're gonna try to start treating children with OCD, that umm… you see to celebrate the smallest things and… and to help children understand anything is progress. Umm… And I just think you did a nice job in there. I want to highlight it. 

00:46:40
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Oh, well, thank you so much. She too started cheering me too. So that's nice. 

00:46:45
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah. Right. That's… That's what we do. Let me also… So… umm… Let's talk a little bit about what's in vivo exposures are. And that's where you're actually practicing the therapy and session. Elizabeth is talking about that. I'm talking about that a little bit, but I wanna make sure that all of you don't just give homework to these children… 

00:47:00
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yes. 

00:47:00
KIMBERLY MORROW …and tell them to practice exposures outside of therapy. It's really important that you're practicing exposures with them in therapy, so that you can see how they're actually doing an exposure, and… and what they're thinking when they're doing an exposure, and how a parent might come in to rescue them when they're doing an exposure. So, you want the parents to be there, you wanna be there, umm… and the child wants to be practicing it, so that you can really happen to be doing the best exposures possible, umm… so that when they do it as homework, umm… that they're successful doing it for their homework. So, I'm thinking about a girl right now who has contamination OCD. She's nine years old. And she made some good progress. Umm… She wasn't washing her hands any more. (inaudible ) at school and at home. She'd stopped washing her hands after she got contaminated, but she still had really severe anxiety around contamination. And I was trying to figure out so what's, you know, what's that about and often saying, you know, "You gotta be a detective with me. We gotta figure this out, because you shouldn't be having this much of anxiety still if you're not washing your hands." And she kind of smiled sheepishly at me, and… and she… I said, "Okay, so what else do you think you're doing that's giving power to this bully?" And she told me that she was using hand sanitizer. And I'm like, "Of course, why didn't I think of the hand sanitizer!" Right. Umm… And so I asked her if she would be willing to practice and exposure with me in session and give me her hand sanitizer. And as soon as I said that, I knew I had taken her too far. She was reduced to tears. She crawled in her mom's lap. She sobbed in her chest. And I thought, all right, I went too far, and by the way, it's okay, you're going to make mistakes as therapists doing this. And… And all you do is you just reel it back. So then I said to her, "Well, I… I'm clear that this is too difficult for you to do right now. I'm wondering what you might be able to do." And I came up with a couple examples, and she kept saying, no, no, no, she couldn't do, and she was still crying. And I said, "Well, you know what, I seem to think that there might be some hand sanitizer in our office. And would you be willing to go on a treasure hunt with me to see who else uses hand sanitizer, and let's take it away from them?" And her eyes all of a sudden got lit up and she smiled. And I said, "Would you be willing to go with me looking for it?" And she said, "Sure." So, she ended up finding about eight bottles of hand sanitizer, one… that was… Can you see this? One being like and this big that was in our waiting room. Now, this is a group of people who we all treat OCDs, I found it hilarious, that we had a huge bottle of hand sanitizer in our waiting room. She took them from everybody, giggling as she went, and we all know that we're gonna be doing exposures all over the office so people knew what she was doing. Umm… And that was the beginning of her being able to do her own therapy. And so at the end of the session she said, "Kimberly, can you wait just one minute?" And I said, "Sure!" And so she brought her mom out for her car, she came back and she had ten bottles of hand sanitizer that both her and her mother had been using while they're in the car, and she me… she handed them all over to me, and that was the beginning of her getting better. So, I just, again, wanted to say that really doing it in session and finding a small place to start is really important to do. 

00:50:00
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yeah, and also getting the mother on board, because if that mother is enabling her daughter by buying all that hand sanitizer and giving it to her all the time, it's important for her mother to understand that is part of the compulsion that her daughter has gotten her involved with, it's not just a… a health measure at that point. 

00:50:15
KIMBERLY MORROW Exactly, exactly. 

00:50:20
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER And… And that's one of the things that I find can be hard to explain to people. Some of the things that we ask people to do… washing hands, I think, is… is a great example, because what do we have in the bathrooms when we go at a public buildings? We've got all kinds of signs up telling us it's a public health measure to wash your hands. Umm… And… And that's true, but the important thing for this particular person with OCD is that, the OCD is more detrimental to her life than any small measure of keeping her hands clean could possibly be. And it's incredibly important to understand that, because otherwise you think, well, we just have to come back to sort of what a regular thing is, and no we can't, we have to go beyond what a regular thing is in order to get the person back to not having the OCD have such a spell over them. 

00:51:05
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah. I… I talk about that all the time in session, and… and that it's really important to understand that, you know, getting sick because you're exposing yourself to germs umm… or, you know, whatever… you're having knives around the house, umm… yes someone could get hurt, someone could get harmed, but there's uncertainty to that. And… And we all have risks, right? We… We have to choose to live a life with risk, but OCD is a certain thing, we know that this child is suffering every single day with OCD, and so, my goal is to have kids to be able to be done with therapy and say, "I choose to take risks in life. I'm gonna live my life fully, and I would rather get sick than live with OCD." 

00:51:45
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Right, and that… I think that those last two points that we have here on the slide, choosing uncertainty. I think that is just a crucial point that we're making. We are not saying to somebody, you don't need to use hand sanitizer, because you won't get sick. First of all, we couldn't say that to somebody. It wouldn't be true. We don't know if they're gonna get sick or they're not gonna get sick. What we do know is that if they continue to use hand sanitizer, they're gonna continue to be ill with the OCD and its continuing to destroy their life. And if they stop using the hand sanitizer and choose the uncertainty of not knowing if they're gonna get sick or not, they're gonna begin to break that spell of the OCD. 

00:52:20
KIMBERLY MORROW Right. 

00:52:20
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER So we have that phrase, face it, feel it and do the opposite. Umm… And… And again, it's really amazing when people really get the hang that, umm… but it's not easy. I think about a father that I worked with, with his 16-year-old son earlier this week. Who… The son was describing ah… these rituals that he has around doing his homework, and that dad has gotten very involved in his rituals, because the dad said to me, "Well, that's what I always did when I was a kid. I had those rituals and my mom was the one who helped me with those rituals." And… And to explain to this father that we were gonna be moving towards facing it, feeling it, and do the opposite, wow, that… that was something that father… He wasn't really… hadn't really been thinking about that. 

00:53:00
KIMBERLY MORROW Right. 

00:53:00
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER He had to really consider and it was his son, the 16-year-old, who was right on board with that. "Okay, let's move forward with this." So, you have to notice with a parent and child, who is it that's got the anxiety and who is it, that's ready to move forward with it, because, again, like the… the hand sanitizer, the parents can be doing a lot to undermine what the kids are doing in treatment if you don't watch out. 

00:53:20
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah. Umm… I… I think that that's very true. And I think that I… I always, I'm saying to children, they love this, I'll say, you know, "It's gonna to be harder for me to help your… your parents do this right than it's gonna be it from the help you do it right." So, I need your help to tell the parents when they've got it wrong. And kids will love that, because they get to say to their mom and dad, "Hey, mom and dad, you weren't supposed to reassure me right there," or "You weren't supposed to do that for me." Umm… And so, they really love to be in that role where they're umm… helping the parents. And I also say to the kids once, I'll tell, you know, "Little bit I'm gonna teach you guys about coaching." And so once parents understand how to coach, I say to the child, "Now you get to grade your parents. So, next time when you come back, and they'd had to help you… help coach you through an exposure, I want you to give them a grade." And then I say to the parents, "By the way, there has been no parent that's gotten higher than a C." So, you know, the… the truth is… is that the more we all are playful with this, and the more we all mess around with each other, and say that we're all gonna make mistakes, the child doesn't feel like this is all on them to do it right and to do it perfectly. 

00:54:20
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Right. And they kind of… Another point about that in vivo exposure, and the fact that we're doing the in vivo expose, right here in our office, is we are showing the parent, this is what we're wanting you to do working with your child. Well, I think of a little boy that I worked with who was five years old, and he… his mom was in the office and then also his baby sister. Ah… He had terrible fear of contamination. Things were gonna be dirty or chemicals were gonna be dangerous in some way, and he got it, and so he couldn't be anywhere near his baby sister, he couldn't uh… touch any of the things that she had touched, umm… and he also had this fear of… of chemicals. So I had him and his mother carrying his baby sister, walk with me around the office looking for some soap. He found some soap in the bathroom and he brought it back into my office. We all sat on the floor in a circle and we played a little game just passing the soap around between the… between us. And at the beginning, he couldn't participate in the game. His mother and I were passing it back and forth and the sister was playing, the baby sister. And that is important. If we don't do that kind of thing with the parents, how are they gonna be able to carry out those kind of exposures at home. So that in vivo part of what we do is… is really crucial. It doesn't necessarily mean that you go out into the community, there're sometimes you do have to go someplace with somebody who has OCD, but most of what you do it in vivo is in your office. 

00:55:40
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah. So, I wanna say one other thing. So we're talking about practicing exposures. Ah… There's also, you know… Theirs is a couple things. One is spontaneous exposure. So… So your client thinks that is just gonna happen to them. In fact, my clients say, "I swear to God, it would happen to no one else other tan someone with OCD. Umm… And it's true. These… These crazy things do tend to happen to them. Umm… And they need to have a… a plan on… on how to handle it. So, uh… this week, when I had a child with contamination OCD, she did really great therapy in here. She did some in vivo practice exposures, and then I gave her a reward. And she chose a little box of candies. And when she opened them up, they flew all over my office, landed on the floor. And she looked at me, and you could see she had a deer in a headlight look, because she got triggered. And then she said, "Well, looks like it's an opportunity to practice." And she picked up the candies, she gave me some, she gave her mom some, and then she ate some, and we all laughed together. And so, that's what I'm looking for is that, not only can ah… children and parents plan exposures, but when something spontaneous happens that they're able to do it, umm… and… and just kind of roll with it. And then another thing we have on the exposure scripts, and so umm… I wanna speak just a little bit to that, because sometimes kids fear things that you can't actually expose them to, and then it's helpful to actually write it down, like it's a story. And I typically say to a kid, "You wanna write, like it's your worst nightmare." So if they're afraid umm… that they are going to harm themselves, I might have them write a story like they're having nightmare, that they're harming themselves. And then what I have them do is I have them read it over and over and over and over again, the goal being that they begin to see that these are just thoughts that the brain is making up. And when they get to the place where they don't believe it as a truth, but they just get bored with reading these over and over again, then umm… I know that they've umm… you know, that they've done a good exposure. But sometimes you have to do that with exposure scripts. Another thing I often do umm… is, if a child has a bunch of bad thoughts, let's say, I wanna make sure that they're purposely having the bad thought. So I don't want them just to stop doing a compulsion, I want them to chase after the fear or the obsession. So I have these. Do you see these multi-colored post it notes? Umm… I will have a child write down all of their bad thoughts. So, I had one child who actually had gotten much better with her OCD, and then they came in, and they said, "Now I can't stop thinking about what if I don't ever get better?" And that could often happen. It's kind of a secondary form of OCD. And so I said, "Well, let's write it down on these multi-colored post-it notes." And I said, "Every bad thought you have, I'm never gonna get better. I'll always have OCD. I won't get married because of it. I won't be able to finish school because it. Any bad thought that you are having, and I want you to put on these." And then I would put them all over the walls of my office, and we went around and we read them over and over and over again. Then we brought his parents and we had them go around and read them and read them. And what I asked him by the end of it is, what was his anxiety level after we had all gotten done, reading all these thoughts. And he said, "I hardly feel any anxiety at all." But when we started it, and he was telling me, he was so overwhelmed with this idea, in the sphere, that he was never going to get better, that we just face that fear, we did the opposite by thinking it more, not thinking it less, and we did it out loud. So, I just wanna give some examples of that. 

00:58:55
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Oh, I think those are great examples. I can just picture your office covered with those sticky notes. 

00:59:00
KIMBERLY MORROW Yes. 

00:59:05
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER And you and this boy walking around the office, reading those out. I think it's a great example of how you have to take the worst fear and put it down somewhere, whether you were writing it down, whether you're putting it on loop tape, or whether you're putting on sticky notes. You can't just leave it in here, because then it just grows. 

00:59:20
KIMBERLY MORROW Right, right. Okay. So, let's talk a little bit about umm… how we do this more specifically with children. There's some play that we do. I'm gonna just talk on some metaphors and then I'm gonna let you talk about play, Elizabeth. 

00:59:30
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yeah. 

00:59:30
KIMBERLY MORROW So, some of the metaphors that I use with kids is I ask them if they have a dog or not. And if they do, I don't have a dog, but I say, as I understand with dogs umm… if you feed them scraps from the table they will come back, right? If you feed the dog, it will always come back. So you have to be very careful not to feed the dog. And so OCD is helpful in terms of when you're doing exposure therapy, if you do anything that is in response to it, if you have a conversation with OCD, if you think, oh maybe this really didn't happen, or if you think, well I'm just gonna give into it once. I could guarantee you OCD is gonna come back and mess with you. So we work really hard ah… completely not feeding the dog. And they kind of like that analogy, because they know if they have a dog, that their parents are yelling at them every time they give the dog a snack because he always comes back for more, right. Umm… I also like the idea of a tomato plant. So, what's the name of that book? What you do when you worry too much, do you know that book, Elizabeth? 

01:00:30
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Right, right. Okay, here we go. This one! 

01:00:30
KIMBERLY MORROW Hup! That's the book. And who… Do you know who it's by? Can you say who it's by? 

01:00:35
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yeah. So this is Dawn Huebner, H-U-E-B-N-E-R, PhD. And it's a great Guide to Overcoming Anxiety. Kids love this book. 

01:00:40
KIMBERLY MORROW Right. So, in that book, she talks about anxiety and OCD being like a tomato plant. "And that the more you water tomato plant what happens?" And the child will say, "A tomato plant grows bigger." So I'll say, "OCD and anxiety are the same thing. The more you listen to it, the more you do things about it, the bigger OCD will grow. So our goal is to not water it. We want OCD to shrivel up and die, okay." So that's a nice way with that. Also, I talk about, umm… being like a whack-a-mole. I was actually talking about this last night with the support group as well, because if you focus too much on the content rather than the… the overall vulnerability, what'll happen is the child might get better. So let's say, I have a teenager who is obsessed with getting a girlfriend. Umm… And so, his parents were really working with him on different ways that he could get himself a girlfriend. And although that was helpful to some extent, umm… what happened was, his OCD just switched to wanting a car. And so, then he was obsessed with wanting a very specific kind of a car. And when his dad worked with him on ways he could get that car, it's switched to, I don't have enough money. So a kind of whack-a-mole that you get in one area and you whack it down and it pops up in another area. And so from a therapist perspective it's important just for you to understand what that means is that you haven't taught that particular client how to handle the uncertainty of not knowing when they will have a girlfriend or when they will have that car. So it's more important when you're doing exposures to make sure that you're exposing them to the uncertainty and to the distress rather than just the content of their exposure. 

01:02:15
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Absolutely, absolutely. Umm… So, umm… I think about going back to umm… the little girl that I talked about at the beginning, who had the fear that she'd swallowed her zipper, and then the fear that she'd been drinking gasoline. And umm… you know, with her, I thought about therapy as being almost like just drawing therapy. She was incredible. She would get down on the floor of my office with a pad of paper and a bunch of markers, and she would draw picture after picture after picture of herself swallowing her zipper, herself drinking gasoline. And one of the things that I thought was so interesting about this is, it turns out to look very funny when you see a picture of somebody drinking gasoline. You realize how does that exactly work? She does enjoy that process. Umm… And so, it was… it was serious work that was masked as play. She felt like she was just having a great time drawing these pictures, but she really was teaching her brain, "Well, maybe that could happen. I don't know if that's gonna happen or not. Here's what it would look like if it did happen. Okay, that's what I was afraid of." She gave it an outward picture for that thing that had been in her head. And I can… That she had been so caught up in that image, she almost looked delusional. Again, when she went to that pediatrician or she came in here after she was screaming about drinking gasoline, and being able to make it playful, to put it into those pictures and drawings, was just a tremendous change in what happened to her. Umm… I was also thinking about umm… another example that I have of… of a girl who had a terrible fear that her mother was going to die. And she was eight years old. And… Actually it's so funny that we keep talking about all that of these kids who are about the same age, but again, it's… it's understandable, because it's all the age when OCD is… is typically taking hold. Umm… But this little girl is eight-year-old, umm… had recently had a new sibling umm… that her parents had adopted after years of infertility umm… and so the family was… was very different than it had looked for her whole life. Umm… And, you know, her fear that she got going was that her mother was going to die. And she followed her mother around the house and kept checking in with her. "Oh, don't use that knife. That's too dangerous. Maybe you're gonna get electrocuted using the hairdryer." She predicted her mother's death in the most unbelievable range of situations, constantly checking with her mother. (inaudible ) stopping for the red light when they're driving in the car. You can imagine, it was driving the mother crazy. She's taking care of this new baby, and then she's got her eight-year-old, constantly going around and checking to see her if she is safe. Well, I was talking to this little girl, and I said, umm… "You know, it's funny the way that you describe this reminds me of the game of Clue that we used to play umm… when we were kids." So she played the game of Clue. Kimberly, did you play the game of Clue? Do you recognize this? 

01:05:05
KIMBERLY MORROW I… I love the game of Clue. 

01:05:05
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Exactly, right. 

01:05:05
KIMBERLY MORROW But it does date us a little bit. 

01:05:10
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true. (inaudible ) do you have it now today too though? They just have different rooms. (inaudible ). 

01:05:13
KIMBERLY MORROW (inaudible ). 

01:05:15
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER So, yeah, it's was interesting. So… So in Clue, you're trying to go about figuring out who did it? Who was the one who committed the crime? And I said, "Well, in this situation, we don't really need to know that, because we know what your fear thing is your mother, but we're not gonna start with your mother. We're gonna talk about how in Clue we get that wonderful moment when we open up an envelope and we see, who was the person who did it? Who was the person? Well, how did they do it and where did they do it?" So, we might pull out. Umm… She and I made up a pack of cards that were all the implements (inaudible ) happen. So here we have a revolver, okay. A revolver in the master bedroom, and it's where Mr. Green, okay. So that's who died, that's how he died, or how about we have Ms. Scarlet dying in the courtyard, uh… with the candlestick, okay. Well, okay, she thought that was great fun. You know, totally fun to go through and do that. I said, "Okay, so what if we… we make this a little more challenging? What if we make it that I'm the one who's gonna die?" And this is something that I've learned. Kimberly, you pointed out that it's… it's looking at the hierarchy. 

01:06:20
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah. 

01:06:20
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER But another thing that I think is interesting is, people who have these feelings don't necessarily equate this game of Clue with the terrible ten panic fear that she has that her mother might die. And part of what we do as therapist is we break it down using these strategies that… that pull things from other parts of your life and… and break it down into smaller pieces. When they don't see a smaller piece, they just say, "Oh, my gosh! I could have the fear that my mom could die." They don't care to see any way to break that into smaller pieces. But instead I said, "Okay, instead of all those characters, why don't we have me? So Mrs. Spencer is gonna be the one who's gonna die. And she's gonna die in the guest house with poison, right." So we go through and we have me die in all these dramatic and exciting different ways in all these different rooms. And I said, "Okay, now we've done this for a little bit, how would you feel if we change this and talked about your mother having have this happen?" And by that point, she was completely caught up in the game, and her mother is right here with us, while we're… watching us play this. And her mother says, "That's a great idea! Let's see how that would work." So we make a bunch of cards that say my mom. So my mom dies and… Oops, I keep playing the same cards up. In the studio, with the rope, with the rope. And do you see how… Now what we've done is, we've begun to speak directly to the fear that she had. She couldn't start by writing a loop tape. She had to start with something a lot more playful, and bringing it down to the game of Clue, that really helped us, again, kind of break that down and begin to move her along with that process. 

01:08:00
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah, that's… that's a great example. And… And, you know, I am the least creative person around, umm… but I have to tell you that working with kids with OCD, they really challenge me to find fun ways to help them face their fears. And so, whatever you can do to come up with, you even Google it. And speaking of Google, umm… I often Google things with umm… my clients, because they love technology. They love to get on my computer and Google things. So, for… for my clients who had vomit phobia, umm… that can get very, very serious for them, and OCD can get involved and… and have them avoid absolutely anything could possibly umm… help them to vomit. And so, one of the things that we have fun doing is you can actually Google vomit, umm… under images, Google Images, and then what comes up is they have a whole uh… website where you can umm… rank order or… or I guess, give us a scale score to how… how well people vomit. So, believe it or not, this is so disgusting that people actually uh… take videos of them and their friends vomiting and they upload it, and then you get to say that was a 10 that was a five, umm… and so, whereas a child may not even be able to say the word vomit. Once I begin to do that with them, they had some fun with that. Umm… So there's lots of different ways to get creative and… and help children with play, but you're gonna find, if you get stuck doing an exposure with a child, just at least think about what we're sharing with you right now, and that is see if there's a way to be playful with it, and take it down a few notches, umm… and… and you might have more success with it. And… And speaking of taking it down a few notches, the last thing I wanted to speak to with this is that sometimes you have to umm… help families play with this when it's not even related to the child's exposure work, because the child just can't handle doing the exposure work yet. So, I really want families to get good at having conversations around the dinner table about what was difficult in their day, how did they handle it, how did they handle an uncomfortable feeling without fixing it. Umm… Oftentimes, I'll say to a parent when you're making dinner, make one item that everybody hates, umm… and then, whoever eats the most of that item, they get the only dessert, and make it a spectacular dessert, you know. Umm… So, it's really important that the whole family gets involved in being playful with this. And that instead of going around the dinner table and saying what went well with your day, you go around the dinner table and you say how you were challenged in your day, and how you handled it anyways. And if kids and families can begin to do that together, then you might be able take the next step in helping them actually start on their hierarchy with their OCD. Umm… And that's the other thing. I don't I think we talked about rewards yet, did we? Umm… It's really, really important. Do we talk about that somewhere? 

01:10:35
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER We have not talked about rewards yet. 

01:10:35
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. So, it's really important that you reward kids when they're doing exposures. And I have a reward box in my office and I have good stuff in that reward box from the Dollar store. Umm… But parents really need to be thinking about with their children, if they do umm… a certain exposure or if they do multiple exposures, what kind of reward will they get, because not giving them a reward can make the difference as to whether or not your child will do an exposure or not. Do you wanna speak to that, Elizabeth? 

01:11:00
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER I do. I mean, I'm gonna call us… I think we're kind of speaking about this next thing, the next… the next piece of what we're talking about. So, I'm gonna kind of move us to this stage. 

01:11:10
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay, okay. 

01:11:10
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER But I think this is a really important point that we're making that… that all of us do things to reward ourselves when we do something hard. So, ah… it might be a little thing that we… we say to ourselves, we can have a cup of coffee after we've completed a particularly tough writing assignment that we've got to do for work. Ah… We have little things that we do to help us give ourselves credit for something. And the work that we are asking our kids to do with OCD is really hard it's not a little thing. 

01:11:30
KIMBERLY MORROW Yes. 

01:11:35
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER It's really hard what they're doing. And it's important to give them credit for that and give them some kind of reward to show, particularly that the parents are saying, this is a great thing that you're doing, we're really supporting you in your hard work. So, you can do umm… rewards like you're talking about, Kimberly. I find that with older kids, the little umm… things that you might give out, those aren't really the things that they're interested in. 

01:11:55
KIMBERLY MORROW Right. 

01:11:55
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER What they would like to do is work on some kind of a… a tally sheet so that they could work towards maybe ah… getting an online video game if they have… they have to purchase. Umm… That's the kind of thing that they might be more interested in… in doing. Umm… I also think that that there is a place for really immediate reward. So, a tally sheet, you might have a kid who's doing an exposure every day for something in particular, working in two weeks towards a reward, because it's a… maybe an expensive online video game that they want, so it's gonna take some time for them to get to it. But I had a kid, umm… who just went back to school this week after having been out of school for two months due to OCD, and when he was facing that on Monday morning, I said to his mother, as we were planning this, we need something really concrete and tangible for him to hold on to, Monday when he's going to school, not just working towards that video game, we need something else. And she said, "Well, I know he just loves Chinese food and we're not trying to eat very much of it, because uh… we don't feel it's good for my husband's health." And I was like, "Okay, here we go. Chinese food at the end of the day…" Well, this kid is a 16-year-old. His face just lit up with the idea of Chinese food for dinner, and… and we made out a little motivation card, reasons I'm going back to school, and Chinese food was one of those things, it was at the top of the list. Umm… And he did, he made it into school, there's a lot of other stuff that has to be worked on with him, but he made it into school after two months of being out. So, I think rewards can have a big component in helping our… our children do the work that they need to get better. 

01:13:25
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah. So… So, let's switch now and talk about the cognitive uh… piece of… 

01:13:30
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Let's do that. 

01:13:30
KIMBERLY MORROW …cognitive behavioral therapy. Umm… And so, one of the things we know is if kids don't change the way umm… they think about suffering, and… and parents don't change the way they think about suffering, then it's hard for a child to get better. So, one of the things we worked really hard on is helping children think differently about suffering and talk back to their OCD. Umm… I'm gonna talk about just a few ways that I help children talk back to OCD. And it's important that children understand that just because they have these thoughts that that doesn't mean that they are real. Children are such concrete thinkers that often if they… if they're worried that some harm is gonna come to their parent, they really believe that that's dangerous. So, one of the things we're teaching kids is that just because they have a thought, it doesn't make it real or dangerous. And so, once you recognize that, hey, I have a thought, but that doesn't make it real or dangerous, you can begin to talk back to it. So, one of things I may tell kids is… is to actually expect the OCD, so, you know, if… if they have OCD when they go to school, rather than waiting to see if it's gonna show up at school, as soon as they wake up in the morning, I say to them, umm… "Hey OCD, it's morning time. We're going to school. You might wanna join me. I've got some extra room in my backpack today." So, anything that they can do to kind of be silly with OCD and encourage it, again, in terms of the next line it says anxiety as a paradox, it's the opposite of what you think you would do, but it actually is the thing that takes the power away from it, and helps it not feel so believable, right. Umm… Another thing I have kids do is applaud it's audacity. So, let's say umm… you're a perfectionist and… and OCD keeps saying to, you know, umm… your… "You better study more, you better study more, you're… you're gonna flunk this test." I would want a child to be able to say, "Hey, umm… you know what? Nice try but, you know, that's not doing it. And I'm going to bed anyways. But you got anything better up your sleeve? Let's see if you can do something a little bit more?" So, anything you can do to just kind of mess it back… mess with umm… and boss it back, is really important. And, you know, children are raised to learn not to disobey their parents. So, again, anxiety as a paradox, we're really gonna be teaching children in this part of their treatment to disobey OCD, right. Umm… So I'm… Do you… Do you wanna speak a little bit more to that? 

01:15:40
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yeah, I do. And I… And I think that I wanna use the example of the little girl swallowing the gasoline. I think that she swallowed the gasoline again, in… in contrast to another boy that I wanna speak to. So… So, she was an incredibly umm… talkative, umm… an assertive person, and again, drawing all those pictures of the swallow… herself swallowing the gasoline, she was really able to get the point that she was bossing back the OCD. Umm… And… And she had no problem with that, because she was not a person who was gonna let anybody boss her around on the playground or in any situation. So, it took… This concept worked incredibly well for her, almost you didn't… just had try to explain it to her in… in just one little piece, and she was off and running with it. 

01:16:20
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah. 

01:16:20
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER That's in contrast to some kids who have OCD, who are… are just in their personality perhaps, umm… a little more umm… reserved, umm… a little more polite and afraid of rocking the boat. And I think about umm… a boy named Richard, who I worked with, who was 10 years old, and he had a terrible fear that clock faces, uh… were wrong in some way. He kept having to check the clock faces and see what they were doing. It was all kinds of clocks, the… the analog clocks and digital clocks, he kept feeling that there was something he was missing in it, that it wasn't done with a clock face. So, all over his house, he taped up paper over the clock so he couldn't see the clocks, because he found himself stuck in front of the clocks all over the room. He also had a problem with pictures of people, because he felt that the eyes were staring at him. And again, he would get stuck in front of pictures, or in my waiting room, the magazines, when I came out to get him, he had turned all the magazines over, so he couldn't see the pictures anymore. Now, he was an incredibly sweet and polite person. And he had a really hard time with this part about boss… bossing back the OCD. Umm… And we had to practice this over and over and over again, particularly with his mother, because he was just very afraid of doing something that she would be disappointed in him for doing. Umm… And so, we would go around with… umm… around of stuffed animals or puppets, pretending to do different roles, and having him see that we could practice, his mother and I could practice, bossing back that OCD, so that he could see that he could begin to try it out. Umm… So, this takes a… a very different level. And I would say that this concept was more important for him than it was for the girl with the… with the gasoline, because it was so much harder, and it really was, where the OCD was finding his vulnerability and… 

01:18:05
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah. 

01:18:05
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER …and getting him umm… where it was hardest for him do. 

01:18:10
KIMBERLY MORROW And… And I think that's important that you recognized that, Elizabeth, because umm… these… Some of these kids are very meek, others are very assertive, but the very meek ones, you really do have to practice this and say it out loud, because what I say to them is if… if you… if you say to OCD, "Oh, you know, OCD I'm not… I'm not gonna listen to you." What you think OCD thinks? It's like, "Yeah, you're gonna listen to me, because you're so weak and meek and mild." 

01:18:35
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yes. 

01:18:35
KIMBERLY MORROW So, you really have to practice having a voice and say, "I am not gonna listen to you, OCD." So we do that with puppets, and we do that with other umm… ways of role-playing, so that a… a very meek child or a very shy child, has a way to have a voice with OCD, because those are the ones where OCD messes with them on that for sure. Umm… Let's talk about the… the staying neutral, because I think that's a really important umm… piece of that as well, because uh… children with OCD tend to be on one extreme or the other. They ever… They think everything's bad or nothing's gonna happen, and we really want them to be able to stay in that middle place. Again, we've been talking about uncertainty. We want them to be able to say things like, "Well, maybe something bad will happen, maybe it won't." Now that might surprise you as therapist, because we're all in the habit of, if we know nothing bad is gonna happen, must say, you know, "Of course, nothing bad is gonna happen." But the truth is… is, nobody knows that for sure, right. And so, it isn't about whether or not something bad happens, remember, it's about a child being able to use their… their language to say, "Maybe it will, maybe it won't, but I can handle it." And so, those are really key terms that I want children to practice saying, "Maybe something bad will happen, maybe it won't. Maybe I'll get an A, maybe I'll get a C. Umm… Maybe umm… someone's gonna bully me at school, maybe they won't. But I can handle not knowing." Do you understand? 

01:19:55
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Absolutely. That impartial observer, was the… was the technique that helped Joe with the scrupulosity the most, being able to say to himself, these are thoughts, they might happen, they might not happen. I… I might go to hell. I don't know if I'm gonna go to hell. But these are my thoughts that I have right now, and I'm just gonna watch them come and go, and say to them, "Come on along for the ride, as we go to high school. I'm sure you'll have lots of things to tell me today during the day, but I'm gonna go ahead and get my math homework done, even though I have these thoughts going on at the same time." And… And being able to hold those two things at the same time, that he had the thought, but he wasn't gonna act on it, and then he was gonna also go ahead and live his life, that impartial observer piece, that was the part that made a tremendous difference in his getting over the OCD problem. 

01:20:40
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah, because many of these kids just believe they are… that OCD is a part of them, and so being able to separate that out, like… like you did that with your hands, it is really an important piece to make sure teach them. And sometimes I'll ask kids umm… to be like a newspaper reporter, and for the next session to report back to me, how OCD tried to get them to do something. And so, you know, it might look they may come back and say, Well, you know, boy, OCD is telling me I'm gonna get sick, and… and I keep kind of looking at OCD to trying to decide whether… whether I'm gonna listen to it or not. OCD is getting a little bit louder, because I just looked at it, so… so now I'm not gonna look at it. And OCD is kind of knocking on my door and saying, how come you're not listening to me. And, you know, now I'm deciding that I'm not gonna listen too. In fact, I'm gonna go ahead and touch something and… and lick it. Ah… And now OCD is screaming at me." But do you see how… Once they do that, they become a reporter of it, all of a sudden it isn't them, and then they begin to feel like they have some more control over this. 

01:21:35
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yeah, I think that's great. You know, one of the things that I like to do so too is remember, there are lots of people who enjoy being excited or upset or distressed. Just think about horror movies, for example, right. Or how about amusement parks, when you stand in a line at an amusement park, what happens? The amusement park, people who develop that ride, have worked really hard to get you into an aroused, upset state before you get on the roller coaster. 

01:22:00
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. 

01:22:05
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER That's all part of the process. So I say, "Well, your brain does this to you at no cost." And… And people that idea, "Oh okay, right!" It's just kind of like me on the amusement park ride, my OCD comes and it goes, and sometimes I turn out that I'm in the line for the roller coaster, when I didn't realize that I was in the line for the roller coaster, because I thought I was just eating lunch at school, but here something happens that's been a triggering experience to me. And again, it's putting that part back into place that those thoughts can come, those thoughts can go, it doesn't mean you have to do something about them. 

01:22:35
KIMBERLY MORROW Right, right. And so, the practices Thought Action Fusion, that's just an interesting thing that I… I try to do a little bit of teaching around, which is I thought is just a thought, until you do something with it. So, once you do something with it, even if it's still isn't, you know, true, your brain says, "Wait a minute, something must be true about this." So again, back to the ideas, if you're worried that something bad is gonna happen to your mom, that's just a thought, that… that's meaningless, it doesn't mean that anything has happened to your mom, but once you go check on her, and you ask her, has anything happened, you know, is she okay. Now your brain says, "Well, there must be danger." So again, it's just ah… Thought Action Fusion is just something that I ah… explain to parents, probably more than kids, umm… just about how it's really important that we teach them how to be able to hold a thought, and neutralize those thoughts, and not act on them. 

01:23:25
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Well, I think… I think that's a… I think that's a great… a great point. Do you think we should get our puppets out and show everybody how puppets talk to each other? 

01:23:35
KIMBERLY MORROW Let's do that. 

01:23:35
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Okay. 

01:23:35
KIMBERLY MORROW So I have two puppets in my office. Umm… This one… This puppet usually is the child, umm… and that's the one who is practicing, talking back to OCD. And then, this is the OCD monster. Umm… And so, he is gonna be the person who's trying to get them to do something or… or are trying to mess with them. Umm… And so I think today, I'm gonna be the OCD monster, right? And you're gonna… 

01:24:00
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yeah, you be the OCD monster. I want to point out to everybody at home that Kimberley is in Erie, Pennsylvania, and I'm here in Rockville, Maryland. And we weren't trained in the same way, but we've developed these similar kinds of ways of treating kids, because, look, I have the Wizard, who's very often plays the kid, and I have the dragon. And, as you know, I see the anxiety as the dragon. And those are my two puppets. I have a third puppet that I use about for kids ah… who have difficulty with eating different things, because with OCD and anxiety, so often you have kids who are so fussy and ah… upset about eating different things, whether it's different colors of food or textures of food. That's a different puppet. But I do have my three puppets too. I don't have a whole office full of puppets. So, here's my kid. And let's say, ah… maybe… well, we'll show them is the beginning, what starts happening with the beginning of this. So, if you think about Richard, he's kind of my meek kid, because I think he is a good example of somebody who wouldn't start knowing how to talk back to that OCD monster. So, I think Richard will be saying something like that, "I can't stand those clock faces. They're so frightening and… and those faces, those eyes are just drilling into me. 

01:25:05
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah, those eyes are bad, aren't they? And you should be scared of them. And don't look at them, because if you look at them, you're gonna feel even worse. 

01:25:15
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Well… Well, you know what? I think I can look at them even if I'm gonna feel worse. I think… I think I'm gonna try. I'm gonna just try to look at them even if it's gonna make me feel worse. 

01:25:30
KIMBERLY MORROW But you're never gonna feel better. If You… If you don't listen to me, you're gonna feel bad. The whole day, it's gonna totally ruin your whole day 

01:25:35
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER It… It might feel bad the whole day. But you know what? I'm gonna go do it anyway. 'm gonna see what happens. Monster, you're not gonna make me avoid those clocks anymore. 

01:25:50
KIMBERLY MORROW Well, if you're not gonna listen to me, I'm gonna go take a nap. 

01:25:55
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Bye! 

01:25:55
KIMBERLY MORROW Good bye! So, that's… that's a little bit… You know, what we do is, is we practice having kids umm… talk back to the OCD. And… And I really try to be the OCD and make sure that the OCD speaks them in a way that it really does speak to them. And so oftentimes, the way I start that, is I am the child, and I let the child be the OCD monster, because one, it feels more excited to be the OCD monster. And so that way, I get a really good sense of how OCD talks back umm… to the child and then I will, kind of, model for the child how to talk back to OCD. And then we'll switch, and they'll be themselves with the puppet and I'll be OCD monster, and then I'll really work at messing with them in as many ways as I can possibly mess with them, so that they have language to use, to talk back when they're not with me in session. 

01:26:45
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Absolutely. And those are the puppets that I had with Richard, that his mother and I started with him. We couldn't even have Richard speaking as the OCD at beginning. It was… It's all too much for him, but… but we started doing them and then we had him join in it with it, and we went around and around and around with those puppets. It… It… Really, seeing him go from that very meek child, ah… you saw me pretend to be him, but I'm telling you, it was really something, when he stood up to that OCD monster and said, "I'm gonna try doing do it anyway. I don't know what's gonna happen, but I'm gonna try doing it anyway." That is something that that kid has never done before. 

01:27:20
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah. 

01:27:20
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER So that was a whole new experience for him. 

01:27:20
KIMBERLY MORROW And there(ph) is a really important piece of the cognitive therapy is his ability to say, I don't know what's gonna happen, because OCD kept telling him what was gonna happen, and he really stayed the course with saying, I don't know, I'm gonna do this anyways. 

01:27:35
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Exactly. 

01:27:35
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. 

01:27:35
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Exactly. 

01:27:40
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. 

01:27:40
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Okay. 

01:27:40
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. So, you know, we've been saying throughout this… this webinar that it's really important to involve people in the treatment umm… of this child in their OCD. So I involve everybody. I involve the parents. I involve family members. I involve siblings, friends, particularly with adolescents and teenagers. They would much prefer a friend participate in their therapy than their parents, in terms of coaching them. So, I'm gonna teach you little bit about how to coach someone through an exposure. Umm… And what I want to do is, on your downloads, you had something that looked like this, it was tips for anxiety and OCD coaches. Umm… If you would get that out and look in, if you can't get it out right now, I'm just gonna go ahead and read through with you and give you some examples of what it looks like. I also put in there that I umm… bring teammates in, because if… umm… if kids are on teams, oftentimes it helps for everyone to kind of understand how to… what language to use, because the language everybody is using, including teachers, is typically whatever makes the child feel better. And I say, OCD always goes to the weakest link. So whoever is still reassuring them, whoever is still making them feel better, is… is this preventing them from getting well. So the more people you can involve in teaching how to coach the better, okay. So, number one it says, do not reassure someone who is anxious or who has OCD. Now, that means, you cannot do anything that makes them feel better. What you can do is, you can validate their uncomfortable feelings, and you can help them to tolerate them without solving it. So, what that looks like is, you're gonna say something… So let's say your child gets triggered, and they come to you, and they're like, you know, "Mom, I can't go to sleep, but you know, it's… it's something… I just know something bad's gonna happen if I go to sleep." What you're gonna say to them is, "I can see that your OCD is being triggered right now." That's where you're helping them face it. You're… You're labeling it as OCD, or whatever name they gave it. Let's say they gave the name Fred. "I can see that Fred's really messing with you right now. I'm wondering if you can use your skills and handle Fred for the next 15 minutes, if you can't do 15 minutes, say how about for the next two minutes, because we know that if we do something about Fred right now, he's all gonna grow stronger. So, I know that Fred's bothering you. I know it feels really bad. I'm wondering if you can go back to bed for a few minutes and try and handle those feelings, okay." Number two is, you gotta remember that panic and anxiety are normal bodily reactions and they're not harmful, okay. So, even though Fred's bugging him, and he's got all these chemicals going through his body, you're gonna remind him that even though that feels bad, it isn't dangerous. It's just really kind of annoying and uncomfortable. So, if you can help your child go from this being an extreme experience to really helping them again, go into that middle place, into that more neutral place, of helping them understand that it's uncomfortable but not dangerous. Then you wanna be a cheerleader. Convince them that they can tolerate the anxiety feelings or the OCD thoughts, without doing anything to feel better. So remember, a coach, if you think about a coach for track, right, there… And so my son runs track. Let's say he's running and he's a quarter mile into a half-mile run, and he sprinted really hard, and he feels he's gonna throw up, and he's like, "Coach, coach, I gotta stop. I'm gonna throw up. I'm gonna throw up." It is the coach's job to get him to keep going even though if he's afraid he's gonna throw up, right. 

01:31:00
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Okay. 

01:31:00
KIMBERLY MORROW So, that's… As we're teaching parents and family members and teachers to be coaches, we wanna make sure that even though a child might say that I can't do it, I don't wanna do it, I don't think I can do this, your job is to say, I know it feels like you can't, but you've already done it. For the last minute, while we've been talking here, and I bet you can do it for another minute. And when they do it for another minute, that's where we're high-fiving, that's when we're doing a little snoopy dance. We're saying, "Hey, look at that. You don't think you could even do it for a minute, and you did it for two minutes." So, you really wanna be able to cheerlead them and celebrate any amount of time they can spend having these thoughts and feelings and not doing anything about them. Then you actually wanna challenge them to feel worse, which seems a little bit bizarre, but it's a really key piece of therapy. Once a child's able to do one piece of their therapy, remember we talked about how anticipatory anxiety often prevents them from getting started? Well, once they can actually get started, then you wanna see how far you can take them. So, if a child is able… Let's say we're talking about contamination, and I can get a child to umm… touch, touch my computer and then rub it on their cheek, I'll high-five them, I'll cheerlead them, and I'll say, "That was spectacular!" I'll give them a reward, and then I'll say, "You know what, how anxious are you feeling right now? How… How big is that yucky feeling?" And they'll say, "Oh, it's not that big at all anymore now that I did it!" So then I'll say, "So, I'm wondering if we could do something else that has a big feeling attached to it, and show your brain how you can handle that too?" And… And so they'll get a little bit nervous again, and I'll say, "Well, what do you think you can do?" So maybe they touch my computer, and they go back to touching their cheek, and I'll say, "Well, do you think you can touch your lips with it?" And so then when they touch their lips, and I'll say, "Well, I'm actually gonna touch my tongue with it as well. And I'm gonna say to OCD, see I can handle, maybe having germs on my tongue, and I may or may not get sick, but at least I'm not hanging out with you anymore, OCD." So that's how you wanna challenge them to do it a little bit more and a little bit more. Then the other thing that we've been talking to about is helping them change the emotion. Remember anger, frustration, crying, all of that gives OCD power. So you wanna do whatever you can, as a coach, so as a therapist, you're their coach, but you're now teaching parents and teachers and friends to coach them, so you want people to help them change the emotion then have some fun. Remember that laughter can deflate OCD. So that's where friends can be really terrific, because they can really make fun of OCD and have fun with it. Umm… And so you wanna encourage them to be able to do that. Then we wanna teach kids to rate their anxiety. Again, they might use a thermometer on how hard it is or how big it is or rate it from one to ten, because when they're doing an exposure, you want them to stay in an exposure until their anxiety level decreases by 50%. So, if they're doing an exposure and their initial anxiety level is, let's say, an eight, you really want them to stay doing that exposure until they get to about a four. Then, you want them to keep doing exposures throughout the day, throughout several days, until their initial number is about a four, and they can say to you, "You know what, this just doesn't really bother me anymore. Do I gotta keep doing this?" That's when you know that they've had success, okay. Umm… You don't wanna be an enabler or allow anxiety to rope you in. And by the way, OCD will rope every one of you in. It ropes me in every single day. So even though you don't want to rope you in, you really want to be able to recognize when it does and then be able to say, "You know what OCD, I think you just try to get me, and I'm not gonna play that game with you, or I'm not listening to you." So, it's okay to give permission to parents and family members and teachers to know the difference between when they're talking to the child and when OCD is trying to get them to do something, okay. Umm… And then expect that the OCD is gonna reappear, because we know that OCD is a lifelong illness, and even though they might be doing better, OCD is gonna come back, and so don't get… don't get disappointed in the child, don't get disappointed in yourself, just know that you're just gonna go back and use the same skills that you've been using to develop exposures and to coach them through then as well. And then finally, as we've been talking a little bit before is make sure you reward their hard work. Anything that you can do to… to get them to feel like they're making progress, and that you're proud of them is gonna be really important. Umm… Do you wanna talk at all, Elizabeth, about how you teach people to coach or the importance of this? 

01:35:20
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yeah, I do. And I also wanna say that umm… very often OCD is incredibly disruptive to family life. And it's created a situation where the parents can't be parents any longer. It's made a situation so that life, as the family, has known it can't move forward. And I think it's really important to recognize that parents are just doing the best they can with the situation. I see too often a situation where parents end up getting blamed umm… in a certain way for what's happened with the OCD for that kid. And I just don't think it's fair. I mean, I think about a family that I worked with where umm… the daughter umm… developed a fear of throwing anything out. Umm… She still had a thought that there will never be anything exactly like this again. So, she… This started… She'd gone to a concert with her family and put a… her family had put her soda cup at the end of the concert in the trash, and the daughter became hysterical, and they, the whole family spent an hour going through the trash can to find her soda cup, amidst all of the soda cups that were in that trash can, because she said… 

01:36:30
KIMBERLY MORROW That's… It really happens. 

01:36:30
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER It really does. 

01:36:30
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah. 

01:36:30
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER She couldn't… I mean, it… it really sounds horrible, but she couldn't flush her own tissue after she'd use the bathroom. Umm… She couldn't stand to have her plate cleaned up after she'd eaten her meal. Ah… She couldn't stand to have the parents put the trash out at the curb. Ah… This had all happened over a… a gradual period of time, but when I saw them, things were completely out of control in that family. Umm… And we really had to kind of put some family rules into place while we began the therapy. And I have to say that's again one of those situations ah… where early on, I suggested that they go have a medicine consult. So when we talk about getting others to help, we're talking about coaching, but we're also saying, there could be other people who would be involved in helping as well. And we're gonna talk about teachers particularly in another minute. But, definitely with that particular child, having her go get a medicine consult early on was important. And it… Just a few days of taking that SSRI, and having the family rules in place that we came up with, which included things like she must flush her tissue after she'd use the bathroom, but it was unfair to the rest of the family not to do that, she was… Anyway it was a bad situation that was going on with that. She must wash her plate after she'd eaten and the parents must take the trash out to this curb or the health department was gonna be involved. I mean, their… their garage's becoming full of trash. It was just a very bad situation. We impose those family roles. We got our SSRI, and then we could get back to this process of the coaching. Sometimes it really takes getting other people involved before you start with the coaching, ummm… but the coaching is just… 

01:38:05
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah. 

01:38:05
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Go ahead Kimberly. 

01:38:05
KIMBERLY MORROW Well, what I want to say is, that's great example about how OCD really takes the power away from families, umm… and so coaching is one way to say, umm… to really educate families around, okay, this is OCD, and this is how you can talk back to it, not only do we want the children to talk to OCD, we… we want parents to talk back to OCD, and to not participate in these rituals. It… It can get very intricate in… in terms of how parents get involved in these rituals, and… and we need to help parents become empowered again to be parents. And they can't just do it by reading the book on parenting and saying, "I am not gonna participate." They really have to take these steps and do those hierarchies and… and sometimes involve doctors and medicines. Umm… But that's why… You know, you said in the very beginning of the webinar that we need to be a team, umm… and really all need to work together. These parents, if they feel like, we're blaming them for things getting just out of control, the parents are not gonna want to work with us. We need everybody to feel like, this is an awful illness and it takes even us, you know, as therapists, it can really overwhelm us. So if we can work as a team, then we have more power against OCD. 

01:39:15
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Exactly. And that's why I love the… the coaching tips that we've come up. Ah… I think about teenagers that I work with, I like to suggest to them that they take a picture of it and send the picture to their friends, umm… so that their friends can begin to understand what to do, because with teenagers I really can't always get their friends to come in for a session, since some friends are even here. I think about a young man his girl… he had a long distance relationship with his girlfriend, but she was a huge part of enabling him. And ah… when she got that list from him, and again, I felt like he was so proud, so brave… 

01:39:45
KIMBERLY MORROW Yes. 

01:39:45
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER …to send her that list. Ah… So, we really are talking about people being courageous. We're talking about umm… enlisting to support people to help coach the person with OCD to be courageous, because it really is something that's hard to stand up to, those OCD thoughts. 

01:40:00
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah. We also talk on this one, a little bit about support groups. And I… And I keep referring to the one that I ah… was running last night. If you… If your kids and parents have access to a support group, and maybe they don't, but it really is helpful, and you can go to the Obsessive Compulsive Foundation and see where there are OCD support groups. But again, it's really nice, because oftentimes, when a child is struggling, the other people in the support group will coach them through their struggle, and it's just so cool to see everybody, who struggle in a different levels with OCD, to help each other through umm… their… their symptoms and suffering. And so, you know, support groups, intensive treatment programs, can be really helpful, because what they do is, they literally take people to where their triggers are and everybody coaches them through doing that exposure, and it's a very powerful experience. So, if you've got children who are really severely ill, don't be afraid to offer them intensive treatment programs, medicines umm… and support groups, because anything you can do to shore everybody out is gonna be helpful to you. 

01:41:05
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Absolutely. Okay. So we talk about schools? 

01:41:10
KIMBERLY MORROW Yes, let's do that. Umm… So, in terms of working with schools, sometimes kids and parents really wanna keep the schools out of this. And I would say that, if a child is not having any symptoms at school that is fine, we don't need to involve more people than necessary. But if a child is having difficulty getting to school or they're having symptoms at school, then it's imperative that you contact the school, umm… contact the guidance counselor, have them email the teacher, see what symptoms the teachers are noticing, and then make sure that you umm… educate them on what exposure therapy is and how to coach a child through an exposure. So again, you can download this form, which is, umm… I believe, it's anxiety in the school, tips for teachers. And it's similar to the coaching form. By the way, that coaching form, make tons of copies of and give it off to everybody. So, you know, parents should have it, friends should have it, umm… the teachers should have this teaching tip one. And then you're just gonna go through with them and explain the kind of work that's helpful to do with the child at school. Sometimes the guidance counselors can do that, sometimes teachers can do that, but if we have everybody practicing exposures with a child, umm… then it's really helpful umm… for a child to get better. The more people that are doing it, the quicker the child will get better. Do you wanna speak to that or to accommodations? 

01:42:25
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yeah, okay. So, accommodations umm… Accommodations can be really important when you're getting a kid back to school. I think again about the kid that I had go back to school umm… this week. Umm… He's been out for two months, a high school student. So, the accommodations that we needed, where we needed a place that he could go during the day if he was feeling overwhelmed by his OCD, which we agreed with the guidance counselor's office or the nurses office. The goal was to get this kid to go back to school and to be there for the whole day. But we needed an accommodation that if he was feeling overwhelmed, he had some place during the day. You don't wanna a kid umm… having a… a breakdown in the middle of their algebra class, and it's just not in anybody's best interest to have that happen. Umm… Sometimes you need accommodations in… in different kinds of ways. Umm… And I think about a girl that I was working with that in her second grade class, her teacher wanted all the students to come up and sit on the rug in front of ah… her chair for a particular activity that they did ah… every day. And the girl was, I had a lot of contamination about feelings about the rug, and had been not sitting on the rug. Umm… And the teacher felt like the… the child was just being disobedient and sent her to the principal's office ah… for a punishment about that. And we needed to work with the teacher to explain to her that it was an OCD problem, and that we needed an accommodation of the daughter being… of the child being able to come in, with her mother, after school hours, to spend some time, exposing herself to the rug, outside of the whole extra complication of having all those children there, and the teacher's expectations. And once the teacher understood that, she's very… was very willing to do that kind of accommodation. So, one of the things that… that we like to think about is, accommodations are things that we're using to get the child back into some situation, they're not something that we're asking for on a permanent basis. So, you can hear in both of those examples, those are things that we're putting into place in a temporary kind of situation, because we want to get that kid moving forward, and it's just too big to take on the whole thing. Umm… And I think schools are very good about that. What we don't want is we don't want schools to get into a situation where they're tiptoeing around the child and never letting them experience any triggering situation. That is a disaster when you have that. And so it's very important to explain to the school, why you're doing the accommodation, what the end goal is. And that the fact is, we want the kid to be resilient and able to handle lots of different situations. 

01:44:45
KIMBERLY MORROW Ab… Absolutely. And so, sometimes you'll get a situation where a school is already involved, when you're working with a child, when you start to work with a child, and they have accommodations written into a five or four plan or something, but those accommodations are… the purpose of them from the school's perspective was to avoid the child being triggered. 

01:45:05
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Okay. 

01:45:05
KIMBERLY MORROW So I just wanna be very clear that the purpose of accommodations is to utilize a hierarchy, just like we've been talking about, to slowly get the child umm… closer and closer to the situations that trigger them, just like you said, I love the word resilient, so that a child can be resilient in multiple arenas and be able to handle being triggered. So, the goal is not to take away a trigger, the… the goal is to help them face their triggers through accommodations. 

01:45:30
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Yes. 

01:45:30
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. 

01:45:30
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Okay. 

01:45:30
KIMBERLY MORROW Well, it's hard to believe that we're already gonna talk about treatment termination I think, right? 

01:45:35
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER It is extremely hard to believe that we're already talking about treatment termination. 

01:45:40
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah, yeah. So don't you go ahead and get started with that? 

01:45:45
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER So, umm… treatment terminations is really bitter sweet umm… for me. I… I… Typically, I'm finally seeing the kid when they're doing really well, and thriving in their life, and it's so much fun to talk to them, but the goal is always for me to work myself out of a job. I want that kid to be able to be living their life, to have their people who are coaching them able to coach them, so that it doesn't have to be about me being the one who's setting the agenda and checking in about their work on a weekly or biweekly basis. They need to be moving back into their life and not having me in it. So, I see that sadness, because I've gotten to know this person, but I really see that sweetness, that excitement of that child getting that opportunity to move forward with their life. So, treatment termination is not about waiting for the time when the child is symptom-free. It is not about waiting for a time when they do not have any OCD thoughts. It is about looking for that moment, when the child is really beginning to use what they've learned with you, and applying things outside of sessions that you've never gone over with them. So you see that they've had a chance to figure new things out for themselves or the coaches that help them figure out new situations for themselves, and… and apply those things so they're really ready to take on the job of handling those for themselves. Now, one of the things that's important to realize is that, we're setting… we're setting up this… this framework for the kid, that they come in, they've done this chunk of work, and that there is a possibility that they're gonna have some upsurge in OCD in the future. We know that about 50% of children who are treated for OCD are gonna end up having OCD or the full diagnosis as an adult or depression as an adult. And we really don't know, at this point, who it's gonna be, but it's important to normalize that for kids that that is not a failure, that's just the nature of OCD, it's very tricky. And again, it changes over the development of a person that different things matter to us at different points in our lives. So, it's never gonna be a situation that having gone through good treatment that you have to start at the beginning, it's never like that. The next time around it'll be a springboard and typically what will happen is the kids will then get even better than they had gotten before, because they'll have… 

01:47:50
KIMBERLY MORROW Right. 

01:47:50
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER …they're able to use what they already learned in order to move forward. Now, again, I'm the one who likes to use that notebook and keep track of everything with the kid in the notebook, because again, I find that people will do, years later pull that notebook out and… and review it again. So I like to use a… a red sticker, and put a red sticker on the kid's notebook and say, "Let's talk about what red flags are? What do you think you might notice if the OCD were to come back, and now list symptoms?" But the main thing that I want them to say is that there is that distress. They are upset about something, because it could have taken a very different topic this time, and I want them to be able to recognize, "Oh, wait a second, this is that tricky OCD feeling again." So I put this in the notebook, and I have the kid go through and think about what kinds of things they could do if it were to come back. I could come in and see you again. I could go see another therapist if I'm living somewhere else. I could go see medicine… get medicine. But we have kind of a plan in place. And again, that's just normalizing the fact that, it's okay if it starts to come back again. The worst situation is when you see somebody who just runs away from the initial symptoms, because they can't deal with it and then they're typically giving into the problem and it really gets to be a much bigger problem. 

01:49:05
KIMBERLY MORROW Right. I even practice with the child in that last session. I'll… I'll say, "Okay, I'm gonna throw some different OCD things at you." So something that… something that they haven't even struggled with, I will see how they might ah… go through their notebook and find things that they could use to help them, if I threw new OCD symptoms. So if they first had contamination, I might throw a thought at them related to their sexuality or related to harm, just to see can… can they practice coming up with exposures, coming up with… with how do I know when I ask for help, umm… who do I go to help with, that… that type of thing. So, I think it's helpful just to really practice that in that last session. I also like to be creative, so I really encourage kids to… you have them write in t a notebook, I have kids sometimes like comic strips about how they got well. I encourage them and invite them to do something creative where umm… they might be willing to share their journey with getting better from OCD with another child Who's coming in for the first time. So, I ask them to remember what it felt like for them the very first time they came in, and how scared they were, and how they did know I was gonna be able to help them. And… And then they were on a journey with me, and so if they can find a way to write a story about it or draw a picture about it, and… and give me permission, I even share that with other children who come in first. So, you're about to watch a video. It's gonna be a nine-minute video. And this is umm… with a girl, again, who's eight years old, who had many, many areas of OCD as well as panic disorder. Umm… And I asked her what she might like to do, and she wanted me umm… to be a newspaper reporter, and I was to interview her, and she was gonna tell me how you get better from OCD. And so I'm gonna go ahead and let you all watch this video, and then please come back as we're gonna spend just a couple minutes at the end, telling you a really cool ending to her story, as well as some resources that are gonna be helpful to you to continue your learning. 

01:50:50
KIMBERLY MORROW Hi Elizabeth, I'm Kimberly. 

01:50:55
ELIZABETH Hi, nice to meet you. 

01:50:55
KIMBERLY MORROW Nice to meet you too. I understand that you know how to treat anxiety? 

01:51:00
ELIZABETH Yeah. 

01:51:00
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. Well, I work for a newspaper and I thought I would like to write an article and maybe help some other people in the community on how to live with anxiety. And since you have some experience with that, I thought I'd like to interview you. Is that okay? 

01:51:15
ELIZABETH Yeah. 

01:51:15
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. Well, maybe we can get started with what is life for people who have anxiety, all kinds umm… how do they feel inside their body? What kind of worries might they have? 

01:51:25
ELIZABETH Well, they definitely have lots of worries and they could really have any worries. They could have a worry vomiting, or dying, going to a sleep over, going to the bathroom, stinky things, anything, you know, that goes into their head that they don't have control. 

01:51:50
KIMBERLY MORROW Oh! So… So people can worry just about anything. It isn't about a particular thing. It could be anything, and it has to do with whether or not they can control it hah…? 

01:52:00
ELIZABETH Yes. 

01:52:00
KIMBERLY MORROW So, if they feel vulnerable or if they feel like, "Oh my gosh, I don't know if I'm gonna do that test or I don't know if I'm gonna get sick?" Those are the kinds of things people might worry about? 

01:52:10
ELIZABETH Yeah. 

01:52:10
KIMBERLY MORROW Well, that makes sense to me. Okay. Well, umm… What happens then once you go into therapy? How you do you make the decision? How do you know that you need help? 

01:52:25
ELIZABETH Well, it comes to a point where all these worries are popping in your head and you don't know how to control. So, really you just know you need help right away. 

01:52:40
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. How… How bad do you usually feel? 

01:52:40
ELIZABETH Very bad. Everything is popping your head and you just feel terrible so… 

01:52:45
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. So you say your head, you just feel like your brain is kind of taking over and you don't know what to do about it. It makes you feel so bad that you begin to ask for help hah? 

01:52:55
ELIZABETH Yes. 

01:53:00
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. When once you get in for help, umm… what can people expect of therapy and what kinds of things, what's the one of the first things you do when you're going to therapy? 

01:53:10
ELIZABETH Well, your name (inaudible ) that's telling you all these things in your head. 

01:53:15
KIMBERLY MORROW Oh! 

01:53:15
ELIZABETH What I named my mind was trickster, because it's checking me about all these things that I'm gonna do (inaudible ). 

01:53:25
KIMBERLY MORROW So, you learn that these things weren't really happening, that these things were things your brain was making up, and it was trying to trick you into thinking these things were gonna happen? 

01:53:35
ELIZABETH Yeah. 

01:53:35
KIMBERLY MORROW Ah, what a clever idea, you call it trickster! I like that idea! So what else you it? Trickster, then what's the next part of therapy? 

01:53:45
ELIZABETH Well, you learn how to talk to your brain. 

01:53:50
KIMBERLY MORROW Can you give me an example of how you… because I… I don't think I've ever talked to my brain before, I'm sure how you do that? 

01:53:55
ELIZABETH Well, if it's whenever is bugging you about, I usually tell it, just plainly, be quiet, or I say, I don't feel like listening to you, I'm too busy playing, things… ordinary things that are happening at the moment. 

01:54:15
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. So you just try to distract yourself with things that are going on, but you learn that you don't have to listen to your brain, because it's tricking you can actually talk back to it that you don't have to do everything it says. What if that makes you feel bad though? What if your brain tells you, don't go to school today because you might throw up? Umm… And you say, "Well, hey, there's a movie going on at school. I wanna go to school anyways." But what if you go to school and you still feel bad? Is that okay for you to feel bad even…? 

01:54:45
ELIZABETH Yes. And it's okay to feel bad as long as you talk to your brain. 

01:54:50
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. So it's okay to feel bad, but you just have to learn how to (inaudible ) yourself, no matter how bad I feel, I'm gonna go ahead and do this anyways. 

01:54:55
ELIZABETH Yeah. 

01:55:00
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay, okay. So I'm hearing you say, first you give it a name, and then you learn how to talk back to your brain, you realize that your brain is tricking you, so that you can actually control (inaudible ), that's another part of therapy. 

01:55:10
ELIZABETH Well, most likely your therapist will do exposures with you 

01:55:15
KIMBERLY MORROW That sounds kind of scary. What's an exposure? 

01:55:20
ELIZABETH Exposure is if you're are worried about throwing up, she might have to play with throw up. 

01:55:25
KIMBERLY MORROW Ah! 

01:55:25
ELIZABETH Or if you're worried about feeling dizzy, she might spin you in a dizzy checker a minute, anything that you're worried about, most likely (inaudible ) exposure. 

01:55:40
KIMBERLY MORROW So if I got (inaudible ) exposure is actually forcing you to do exactly what you're afraid of? 

01:55:45
ELIZABETH Yeah. 

01:55:50
KIMBERLY MORROW Why on earth would someone do that? 

01:55:50
ELIZABETH Because once you face your fears it goes to (inaudible ) and you know that you just check in. 

01:56:00
KIMBERLY MORROW Oh! So, in essence you're kind of tricking your brain and to realizing that it wasn't right, and then you're actually are gonna put to the challenge, hah. So, you actually do have floor up and around and you're actually staying in chairs and I can sit here if you're afraid to go to school you have to go the school, hah? 

01:56:20
ELIZABETH Yeah. 

01:56:20
KIMBERLY MORROW Even though you might feel bad? 

01:56:25
ELIZABETH Hmm… 

01:56:25
KIMBERLY MORROW Well, okay. So, you give it a name, you change the way you talk to your brain, and you begin to face your fears. Well, what are your parents during all this time? 

01:56:40
ELIZABETH Well, once you go to a therapist your parents learn that they can reassure and tell you that your fears are going to have it. So, I was worried about throwing up, my parents would most likely tell me go to school and throw up. 

01:57:00
KIMBERLY MORROW (inaudible ). Are your parents (inaudible ), was that really hard for them to do? 

01:57:05
ELIZABETH That was really hard for them to do. 

01:57:05
KIMBERLY MORROW Well, okay. Because as a parent, because I'm a parent, all I know is I just want my kids to feel good. I don't want them to feel bad, and if I'm hearing you correctly, you're telling me that I would have to change the way I parent them and to let them know that it's okay for them to go throw up and for them to feel bad. 

01:57:25
ELIZABETH Yeah. 

01:57:25
KIMBERLY MORROW Wow! So, how does that work? Once your parents were able to start… to stop reassuring you and encourage you to feel bad, what happened? Did anybody get worse or did you get better? 

01:57:45
ELIZABETH You get better and stronger and… because they're telling you it's gonna happen and once you realize that it's not, you'll know that it's just tricking you and you get stronger. 

01:58:00
KIMBERLY MORROW Well, okay. Is there any other kind of therapy that you think it's important for me to include in my article? 

01:58:05
ELIZABETH Well, if you talk to your brain quietly and not allowing strong and here it's not gonna go away as easily, you have to be very strong and believe it. 

01:58:20
KIMBERLY MORROW Why… Why is that important? You mentioned (inaudible ) therapy that you learn how to talk to your brain, so you say, (inaudible ) brain, I'm not gonna listen to you. I feel like going and playing anyways, so I'm not gonna let you keep me from playing, and you're saying that you have to say that aloud, hah, in a strong voice. Why is it important to do that? 

01:58:40
ELIZABETH Because of you just said it quietly and like… like gasp and gonna do that it's not definite and it's not for sure. 

01:58:55
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. So you feel strong and you have confidence when you're saying it loudly, hah. And if you have more confidence, you're more likely probably to do it… to do it, to face your fears, hah. 

01:59:05
ELIZABETH Umm…hmm… 

01:59:05
KIMBERLY MORROW Well, okay. So, you've learned to talk loud and strong it sounds like. 

01:59:10
ELIZABETH Yeah. 

01:59:10
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. So when you look back, at when you first started therapy, because I'm hearing you said you don't know how to do therapy, because you done it yourself, hah? 

01:59:15
ELIZABETH Umm…hmm… 

01:59:20
KIMBERLY MORROW When you look back and when you first started therapy, and how you're handling your anxiety today, what do you think is different? I mean, how… how much different do you feel? 

01:59:30
ELIZABETH Well, back then I had a bunch of different fears pop into to my head all the same time, and I didn't know how to handle them, and now I just might have a couple of fears and I know how I can handle them and get rid of them. 

01:59:45
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. So, are you able to do all the things that any other kid your age will be doing? 

01:59:50
ELIZABETH Yes. 

01:59:50
KIMBERLY MORROW Ah, okay! So you're going to school and having fun and being silly and all that kind of stuff? 

01:59:55
ELIZABETH Umm…hmm… 

01:59:55
KIMBERLY MORROW Great, okay! Do you have any questions for her about this? 

02:00:00
UNKNOWN No, actually I learned a lot by just listening. 

02:00:05
KIMBERLY MORROW Isn't she nervous? 

02:00:05
UNKNOWN Yes, very good. My goodness! Umm…hmm… That is almost like steps right there you know you identify… 

02:00:15
KIMBERLY MORROW Okay. So that was the video of the girl who umm… is eight years old was struggling with many forms of OCD. And I think you got to see… 

02:00:20
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Adorable! 

02:00:20
KIMBERLY MORROW Yeah. 

02:00:20
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Adorable! 

02:00:25
KIMBERLY MORROW Umm… She is adorable. She continues to be, because now she is umm… like 20 or something like that, and uh… she goes to Brown University, and she is now on the consumer panel for mental health. Umm… The government has a group where umm… her job is to go out and educate other consumers about that there's good evidence-based treatment for mental illness. So she was recently this fall on the today show talking about how to get umm… how to find a therapist and how umm… to ask for evidence-based treatment. And so, she is committed to helping others get better because of the experience that she had umm… in being treated for her OCD. So it's really kind of fun to realize that ah… the people that you treat are gonna make a difference in other people's lives. 

02:01:10
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER Absolutely. And… And we don't have a words from her now, but I wanted to share with you what that… that 15-year-old that I saw with OCD, with a scrupulosity, what he said at the end of his treatment, because it was… it was just wonderful to me to hear this. He said, "Doing better makes me love myself. Even with these thoughts, I love myself, because I see how well I'm doing handling them." He said, "Life is so good. It's just amazing how good life is." 

02:01:40
KIMBERLY MORROW Ah! This why I love working with kids with OCD! 

02:01:45
ELIZABETH DUPONT SPENCER It's just… It's just wonderful…
