LISA A. SUZUKI  So, uhm, I was so excited about presenting on this topic when I, uh, when I was first talking about the title, uh, with a colleague. So many ideas came to mind about what I could talk about but as I actually sat down to write, I began to have major doubts about what my presentation would be about. I have written with papers, I have written about ethnography but somehow I couldn't locate the passion in those writings and what was, what was it, what was it about, was it that I'm doing. I was looking for something really provocative to say today, uhm, and I found myself getting more and more confused.

LISA A. SUZUKI  As a title of the presentation implies, qualitative research methods, provide us with the means to gain deep, rich, and yes, thick description of the lives of those whom we study. But does description automatically imply understanding? Through the use of language that is narratives, artifacts, photographs, diaries, letters, observations, we can gave encloses(ph) of culture. But do we ever accurately understand the culture of others? What the heck is culture? So, in this presentation, I wanted to highlight a few things. 

00:01:55
Highlights My story What does culture mean? Relying upon the spoken word Where to next? 

00:01:55
LISA A. SUZUKI To begin, I wanted to share a little bit about my cultural context and what I bring to the topic. I wanna talk a little bit about how we've learned to rely upon only the spoken word in our research. And then lastly, to think about with you where do we go from here. Let me begin by telling about myself. Uhm, since, as we embark on a discussion of contextualizing the lives of other people it's really important to begin to think about our own. Uhm, I wanted to, uhm, start-off by just talking a little bit of my own cultural context and this is a picture of my father, uhm, who is currently suffering from Alzheimers and as I was writing up the, as I was going over the presentation with my husband I asked him, "Do you think I've spent a too much time talking about him?" And, uhm, my husband, uh, who's also a psychologist, said, "Well, you know, I think you want to have his voice present because he's had such an impact on who you are." And I think that that's sure captures it. Uhm, my parents were the children of Japanese immigrants who came to Hawaii for a better, for better work opportunities and were recruited to work on the sugar and pineapple plantations there. They lived in a Japanese camp because on the plantations, uh, people lived in ethnic enclaves. They didn't necessarily, I think there was a, uh, a sense of they didn't want the groups to merge together in case there would be any unionization or any kind of, uh, of revolution or something within the camp. Uhm, uh, my grandfather actually worked for the city as a carpenter later on. Ah, my father was the youngest of a family of 10 siblings. He was in middle school at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack living on Oahu. He recalled this day vividly as he and his friends sat on a hill overlooking Pearl Harbor wondering, "Why there are fireworks going on at Pearl Harbor especially in the morning?" When he learned that the Japanese had attacked, he knew that his life had changed. Martial law and the strong military presence in the Japanese camp were just the few of the changes he experienced. So, it was easy for the soldiers to patrol the perimeter of the Japanese camp. They had a, uh, curfew put on them that they couldn't be out after a certain hour. Ah, military soldiers entered, uh, my fathers home to search for symbols of loyalty to the emperor. My grandfather, aware that they would be suspect, gathered artifacts from the homeland and bury them in the backyard. Among them, my father recalls, was a priceless sword that his father attempted to break, uhm, his, his father was attempted to break who was barely able to bend it. Ah, he recalled to me, "This is the symbol of strength, the sword is so strong that it cannot even be bent." As the soldiers ransacked his home in search of evidence of a traitor, my father said that he vowed that he will prove himself to be, he will prove himself so their loyalty would never be questioned again as his mother sat weeping in the corner. My father was a man of approximately five feet and in an article published in his middle school paper, my father kept everything. So, he had these tiny little articles. He was called small man, Small but Mighty, uhm, was the title of the article, uhm, written about him in the Royal Middle School paper. My father distinct, distinguished himself through a long military career. Uhm, he joined the ROTC at McKinley High School, that's the picture there, uhm, as in many of his friends. He told me that he had something to prove back then. As a 1st Lieutenant, uhm, oh, he was drafted in the Korean War and was promoted on the field as a Company Commander. He told me that he had something to prove back then. As a 1st Lieutenant, he went out on reconnaissance missions as a point man and mentioned that it was the soldiers who also had something to prove volunteered. He recalled how cold it was in Korea and how nothing would fit him because he was so small. Everything was oversized. He recalled how the West Point officers treated the soldiers and how he felt he had to stand up to them. One incident involved metal drinking cups that he knew could not be used in the cold climate because as you know if you drink from an aluminum cup in the dead of winter, your, your skin will stick to it. Uhm, he also recalled one officer saying that the Native American soldiers could just stay out in the tents because they were used to living in tepees. He shared that the Black soldiers in his unit weren't motivated because they were never treated well. My father got a college education after the war on the G.I. Bill attending Georgetown and later worked for the Pentagon. My two sisters and I were born in Washington, D.C. and lived in an all-White neighborhood in McLean, Virginia. My father was quite proud of this and told me later, "If there were only a few Asians, then you are a novelty. If there are too many, then you're seen as a threat." My parents decided to move to Hawaii shortly after my youngest sister was born and looking back I think that being a novelty was okay for them as a couple but I believe they wanted their children to grow up in a more Asian environment surrounded by a large extended family. My father believed that it was important to fit in. He wanted us to learn good English, to stand up for ourselves, to be assertive, and to achieve. My parents didn't want us to speak Pidgin English, the local dialect. And I remember my sister getting her mouth washed out with soap for saying that she was really pissed off. My sisters and I adopted these values in addition to those surrounding what was considered beautiful. No, for instance, no almond-shaped eyes for us. We would scotch tape our eyelids so that they would fold to make our eyes look larger. So, if you cut a very thin strip of just regular scotch tape and you put it on the, on your eyelid, it will automatically fold. Ah, I remember there was a Japanese make-up company that heard about this and they actually created pastel colored pre-cut scotch tape so that you could put it on and you look like you had eyeshadow. My sister had the most, my oldest sister had the most popular version of plastic surgery in Hawaii. That meant the removal of some of the fat in the eyelid to create a fold to make her eyes look bigger. It is no surprise that Japanese anime characters have really big eyes, that's one of their most distinguishing features. We stayed out in the sun to get tanned, we put hydrogen peroxide in our hair to make it lighter 'coz we didn't think black hair was so cool. We got regular Toni perms to make our hair curly and wavy. In college, uhm, I spent a semester at the University of Hawaii and I took on Ethnics Studies class, it was called Japanese in Hawaii and I learned for the first time about internment. This was a story that I had not, it had not been passed on to me. I asked my parents about it and got a wealth of information but I wondered why it was that it, it hadn't been part of our upbringing to hear about what the Japanese had gone through, uhm, in the United States. They told me who among their friends had been interned, uhm, who continue to have problems and couldn't talk about the experience. As part of this course, we had to address the issue of assimilation or acculturation of the Japanese. So, we had to write an opinion paper about whether after the war we felt that the Japanese should assimilate, should attempt to assimilate or should they acculturate. I wrote seven pages about how assimilation was best, how important it was for us to adopt White middle class values and fit in so that we could succeed in this country. I recall that I was the only student in the class of over 20 who took this perspective where we had to share it and I think I was very enthusiastic so I raised my hand thinking that I was gonna be the first one. And it was so silent and my teacher, Franklin Otto, who's a very, uhm, big in Asian-American ethnic studies. I think he was stunned, I don't think he know what to say. But anyways, I, I went on and on making arguments about why assimilation was a good thing. Uhm, so this was the story that had been passed on to me by my father. I guess you could say that I was at the pre-encounter stage privileging White culture denigrating my own. Uhm, or as one colleague told me, "You are such a banana." But these labels are really only part of the story. They both kind of put a negative valence on where I was in terms of my experience, uhm, and they didn't account for the history that had led me there. I also attended a predominantly White liberal arts college in Walla Walla, Washington and my nickname there was the Little Jap. Now, you might be horrified but this, but it would really didn't bother me at the time and I, and I, you could link that back to pre-encounter and all that. I had to, I think it had to do with being novel since there were only two of us. I should there were only, maybe like four Asian people at the entire school, uhm, so we, sort of, occupy a place of novelty. Uhm, I'd, I should also say that I spent my childhood in a predominant Asian community and this is my first experience being a minority. So, I don't really think of being called the Little Jap is something derogatory necessarily. Now looking back on it I do but at the time I (inaudible ). Uhm, I could toy with other students based upon their limited knowledge of my background. There was, uhm, the other, there was another girl at school by the name of Joy Kawasaki and we jokingly mentioned that we were heirs the Kas, Kawasaki and Suzuki motorcycle companies. (laughing) Little did they know that Suzuki is one of the most common names in Japan and indeed comprises, occupies multiple pages of a, of a phonebook. But what was interesting about this is that even when during(ph) I decided, "Hey, we'll better probably tell people that we really aren't heirs (inaudible )." Uhm, but they didn't believe us. They were like, "Oh, come on." Uhm, but had I adopted, had I only adopted the vestiges of White culture, the issue I believe is more complex. As you will note, I haven't really mentioned my mother. She was, as I say, quiet but effective. She managed my father very subtly. She reminded me not to make waves to fit in and maintain social harmony whenever possible. My father called the similar strength to him with the sword. For my mother, she thought more in terms of that the symbol of strength in the Japanese culture was bamboo. It bends with the flow of nature but it never breaks. So, there's, there was, sort of, difference between those, those two symbols that my sisters and I struggled with growing up. So, I wasn't completely adhering to only the dominant culture, I also know a little bit about Japanese traditions. I know how rice bowls at funeral, rice bowls at funerals should be round and not triangular. I know that on New Year's we make kagami mochi, we do mochi pounding. And I recalled, uhm, some of the symbols growing up and this is a katomatsu, uhm, which symbolizes strength. Interestingly, there was a best-selling book a few years ago called Things Japanese, as people search for the meanings of some of the traditions that had been lost over the years. So, I remembered this image of a katomatsu and I could not remember exactly what it meant. So, I called my mother a couple of nights ago and I said, "Mom, what was," I couldn't even remember the name of it, I said, "what was the thing called that was made out of bamboo, it was tied with rope, it had a stick of pine and it had some cutting. We would stuck oranges in front of it or whatever for New Year's?" And she goes, "Uhm, I don't know." She was, "Well, let me think about that, let me think about that." And so, she's trying to recall and there, and my mother rents rooms to students who were coming to learn, uhm, English in Hawaii so she was renting a room to a Japanese student who was also present there. And I could overhear her talking to this girl saying, "What do you call that thing, the thing with the bamboo for New Year's, what is that called?" And the girl from Japan is like, "I don't know, I don't know. What is that?" That's not the right accent but anyways (laughing) uhm, (inaudible ). Okay. So, anyways, uhm, anyways, so there was, (laughs) she was trying to explain this. So the, so the girl from Japan goes on to Google, she said, "I'll Google it." So, she's Googling it and she can't, of course, find it. So, uhm, so my mother says to me, she says, "When do you need this?" Okay, this is a parent-child interaction thing that goes way back that I always do things last minute. So, she goes, uhm, "You need it right away, don't you? You need it tonight, don't you?" And I said, "Well, it would be helpful because I want it to, to the presentation(ph)." So, she said, "Okay, I'm gonna call you back in five minutes. I'm gonna go find the article." So, she calls back in five minutes she goes, " I found the article and I'm gonna mail it to you so you will remember what a katomatsu is." Okay, but not, not actually that my mother didn't remember what it was either. Okay. So, anyways, so she says, uhm, uh, she was, "It's made of bamboo and it is a symbol of strength." Okay. She says, uhm, "The bamboos represent strength, the pine signifies longevity and the fruiting branch represents prosperity. It is the unity of these basic elements that bring hope that the new year will be a good one. The katomatsu must be composed of all odd numbered representations like three bamboo stalks, opening of the bamboo must be free and open to allow the spirits to enter and the cuts must be made at a slant to allow the largest open area. Pine inserted into the binding is also represented by odd numbered counts. The katomatsu is put on display five days before the New Year and burned five days after the New Year." And my mother was very clear, "You cannot save them and you have to have a new one every year." I said, "Why is that?" She goes, "I have no idea." (laughing) Uhm, so, I, I was talking to my sister last night and I said, "Hey, do you remember the katomatsu thing?" And she goes, "Oh, yes," she says, "I remember that thing." She said, "You know, they're so pretty. I actually wanted to save it, you know, to keep it because it's, it's really nice." And she goes, " My friend told me that you cannot save them. You must throw them away every year and buy a new one." I don't know if it's a marketing strategy by the company that makes it, but I don't know. Uhm, anyways, so my sister says, she(ph) says, "You know, we should find this out because," she said, "in order to be really green," she goes, "maybe we should be recycling these things." (laughing) So, so, so, why am I telling you this? Well, in my life it is clear that rituals and symbols are passed on but in these examples it appear, it seems as though the meaning is lost. So, when my mother was confused as to why the Japanese student did not know what a katomatsu is, it maybe that with(ph) all the symbol may effect one time been known in Japan, the culture has moved on. So, cultures are dynamic and they change but in the memories of those who have immigrated, it left the symbol of the katomatsu means firm. So, what my mother, uh, and her family recalled in some ways existed only in the memories that were passed on. It's important to note that though the meaning may not be recalled this does not diminished the importance of the symbol in the community. In, in another example, uhm, in Hawaii when you get married your, the, there's, uh, a good luck number is 1001. So, your friends and you get together and you make 1000 golden or silver cranes, folded origami cranes, right. And then, the last one is supposed to be made by your soon-to-be spouse so that the 1001 becomes very, very important. So, when I was getting married, I was talking to a student from Japan, Tamiko, and I said to her, "Oh, I'm so," I said, "oh, I'm so busy making these Japanese cranes." And she said, "What are you making those for?" And I said, "Well, you know, the 1001 cranes for when you get married." She goes, "Actually, I've never ever heard of that." So again, again, the, the number carried over but the meaning, perhaps, uhm, has not changed. Okay, uhm, so, now that you know something about my story, uhm, let me begin the topic. 

00:19:15
LISA A. SUZUKI So, what does culture mean? Culture is an exceedingly complex and meant to this construct. It is as transparent as the water in which the fish swims and it is for this reason that many White students believe that they don't have a culture and that they feel people of color unlucky because they do. I still heard reports of students who say this when they arrive in a multicultural counseling classes. So, one of the definitions of culture that I like best is by Clifford Geertz. Uhm, some of the, I, I'd wanted to say for those who of you that went to see, uhm, Dr. Trimble's talk this morning a lot of this overlaps, uhm, with what he said as well. Ah, Geertz said(ph), uh, Geertz is a, uh, anthro, a culture anthropologist also, he knows that culture denotes a historically transmitted pattern of meanings embodied in symbols, a system of inherited conceptions in symbolic forms by means of which men, women communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about an attitudes towards life. What I think about the phrase "transmitted means, transmitted patterns of meanings" I think about the cultural context in which I was raised and what was transmitted to me. In addition, I think also now that I have a daughter so I think about what kinds of cultural symbols and meanings do I transmitted to her. I recall, uhm, being at the park one day and when she was two years old and one of the things that I think about is how do I teach her about what race means, what racial tensions are, what prejudice is, et cetera. So, she was two years old like when you're playing, she was playing on the swings with her friend, uhm, and, uhm, and she announces just out of the blue, "Mommy, I don't like Black people." I was horrified. So, anyway, so I try to, sort of, reason with her and I said, "Well, can you let, you know, you know, when you think about, you know, you have a lot," I went to the same thing, "you have a lot of friends that are Black, you have an auntie that's Black." So, then she said it louder, " Mommy, I don't like Black people." So, perfect(ph). So, my friend who knows that I do work in multicultural turns to me and says, "Okay, Ms. Multicultural handle it." (laughing) So, I handled it by picking my daughter up out of the swing and taking her home. And, uhm, and sitting her down and really talking to her about the issue of color. And I said, "You know, little Caitlyn," I said, again bringing up people that she knew 'coz I thought that would be the anchors that she would recall, "you know, you have an auntie that's Black, your cousins are half-Black, you have these friends." And she looks at me and she said, "That's not what I meant." And then, she proceeded to tell me that she was having nightmares about, 'coz her friend at daycare had brought the Wizard of Oz to see and she recalled the image of the witch. Do you remember the witch? It kinda scary like the one that the evil witch whatever which one is I know. Anyways, so, again the, the image of blackness with, wasn't related really to skin color but the whole foreboding evil image of this woman in a black hat and skirt because Warner Brothers when they colorize the, the Wizard of Oz, they didn't make them black they made them green. So, it wasn't really about skin color. But again my interpretation of what she said at the park and thinking about what other people are hearing was that she was saying something very derogatory about Black people. So, uhm, so at least, so, we, sort of, got through that. Uhm, and then on another occasion, uhm, she came to me and she said, "What color am I?" She was I think about three and I said, " Well," so I was gonna going to, uh, an explanation, she said to me, "Well," she was, "I think I look White like daddy so I must be White." So, of course, I followed her out to the living room and I said, "Well, actually Caitlyn," she was (inaudible ), "and what color are you?" And I said, "Well, as I said, you know, Caitlyn, Asians, and your mommy is Japanese," and I said, "you know, Asians are considered yellow. And she said, "Well, you don't look yellow." So, she looks at me and she goes, " So, you're yellow, daddy's white, I must be beige." And then she walked off. (laughing) And I was like, and that sort, sort of one of those moments we're like do I follow because it seems just like, you know, how they say sometimes that you just given enough information and then, 'coz someone is, we're more invested in, in what they're gonna know. She's only three years old, what, what is your concept of raising and so. Anyways, so and we let that go. So, if you meet my daughter and she says that she's beige and that's what it comes from. So, uhm, but anyways, so, I reread Geertz's definition, uhm, and again to think about my own work which I would frame in the multiculture tradition. I hadn't attended to the vital aspects of the definition. In my quantitative work, I believe, uhm, looking back that I quitted culture with race or ethnicity. So, when I was doing my work on a cue testing, for instance, I group participants according to their self-identified grouping and I made assumptions about how their performance on various measures reflected cultural differences. This, uhm, so I had a data set of about 4,000 subject, 4,000 subjects on the whiz car of varying, uhm, racial ethnic groups and, uhm, and I was looking at ability profiles or ability patterns. And what I found was that I could predict the racial ethnic grouping of the children based upon their profile of abilities at a rate that was significantly better than chance. Okay, so, my explanation which was just kind of in one sentence was, uhm, Asian scored higher on nonverbal abilities because they rely a great deal more on nonverbal forms of communication. Therefore, cultures reinforce particular forms of ability and that's why we see differential ability patterns. Okay. A nice type explanation without much meaning to it looking back. I reread Geertz's chapter entitled Thick Description Toward an Interpretative Area of Culture. I came across a passage that conveyed the difficulties in operationalizing what a culture is. So, he writes, "Operationalism as a methodological dogma never made much sense so far as the social sciences are concerned, and except for a few rather too well-swept corners, Skinnerian behaviorism, intelligence testing, and so on, it is largely dead now." But is it dead, really? Are we misidentifying? Why referred to a thin description that indicates what behavior the participant engages in. So, we described what we see. So, in the case at the park, people would describe that they saw a little girl telling her mother that she hates Black people. But this should not be confused with thick description that which is meaningful and interpretative of the behavior. As Geertz notes, " A twitch and a wink can appear equivalent to the observer but have very different meanings. It is often in the meaning that the action becomes culturally relevant." 

00:26:35
LISA A. SUZUKI  Relying upon the spoken word. And for parrying this section of my presentation, I went back to some of the classics written by those who had devoted their lives to understanding the lifting experience of others namely anthropologists. As I looked on the shelves of our local, of our school bookstore it did not surprised me that psychology text were placed next to the anthropology books given the overlapping emphasis on understanding human experience. I was speaking with a colleague about this presentation and she mentioned that a number of anthropologists are being hired by the military and if you go down to the basement, by the cafeteria, there's actually a flyer for, uhm, anthropologists, uhm, for meeting for the military. Uhm, that they're being hired by the military to work in Iraq to gai, help gain an understanding of the local culture. This phenomena is reminiscent of the work of Ruth Benedict, of course, Dr. Trimble spoke about this morning, who interviewed Japanese internees to gain an understanding of the Japanese psyche during World War II. A quote from a book, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, highlights the complexity of attempting to understand cultures that are different from our own. So she writes, "The Japanese are, to the highest degree, both aggressive and nonaggressive, both militaristic and aesthetic, both insolent and polite, rigid and adaptable, submissive and resentful of being pushed around, loyal and treacherous, brave and timid, conservative and hospitable to new ways." In addition, she, as she interviewed the people of Japanese descent in America she noted, "They're amazingly frank. Of course they did not present the whole picture. No people ever does. A Japanese who writes about Japan passes over really crucial things which are as familiar to him as invisible as the air he breathes. So do Americans when they write about America." The take home message is that cultures are extremely complex to the outside observer and relying upon the narrative of individuals within the culture no matter how open they are to sharing pro, sharing provides an incomplete picture. The difficulties of being an outsider other is perhaps best illustrated in the work by Napoleon Chagnon who wrote with students in nearly every introduction to anthropology class read and what many 3rd grade teachers also read in preparing students to understand indigenous cultures. The title of the book was Yanomamo: The Fierce People. Chagnon lived among the Yanomamo for 19 months and then return nearly every year after that. This reflects the importance of prolonged engagement with Dr. Trimble also highlight it. In one passage he talks about, he says, "I was amused by the candor of one of my long-time friends as he reflected about my early days in his village. 'I remember when you first came to live with us,' he said, 'as we dozed in our hammocks on some trail between two remote villages, waiting for night to come. We could really intimidate and trick you then and make you give away vast quantities of valuable goods for almost nothing and convinced you that it was a fair trade, fair bargain.' He laughed aloud and sighed, ' Those days are gone, for you know the language too well now, and you have become just like us, you know how to trade. You have become a Yanomamo." This passage is a direct contrast to some of the passages that he talked about when he was actually gathering his data on genealogies for the tribe. " They enjoyed watching me learn these names. I assumed, wrongly, that I would get the truth to each question and that I would get the best information by working in public. This set the stage for converting a serious, converting up serious project into a farce. Each informant tried to outdo his peers by inventing a name even more ridiculous than what I had been given earlier, or by asserting that the individual about whom I inquired was married to his mother or daughter, and the like. I would have the informant whisper the name of the individual in my ear, noting that he was the father of such and such a child. Everybody would then insist that I repeat the name aloud, roaring in hysterics as I clumsily pronounced the name. I assumed that the laughter was in response to the violation of the name taboo,' 'coz (inaudible ) allowed, 'or to my pronunciation. This was a reasonable interpretation since the individual whose name I said aloud became invariably angry. After I learned what some of the names meant, I began to understand what the laughter was all about. A few of the more colorful examples are: 'hairy vagina,' 'long penis,' 'feces of the harpy eagle,' and ' dirty rectum.' No wonder the (laughing) victims were angry. As I became more proficient in the language and more skilled in detecting lies, my informants became better at lying. One of them in particular was so cunning and persuasive that I was shocked to discover that he had been inventing his information. After five months of almost constant work on the genealogies of just one group, I had to begin almost from scratch." Chagnon mingles on to discuss the strategies that he had to adopt to attain greater accuracy in understanding what he was hoping to learn was about the kingship patterns of the group. Now, well, we as, uhm, educators, psychologists, researchers, well, we generally do not study indigenous cultures experiencing first contact with outsiders. This serves an, serves as an extreme example of perhaps a larger issue of how we know when we are studying a phenomena of relevance to the group we are studying. The notion of genealogies were important to the researcher in understanding kingship patterns was not viewed as a priority to participants who, as Chagnon writes, were more interested in obtaining payment and making fun of the researchers lack of knowledge of the cul, of the language and culture. Indeed, in qualitative research there is always the difficulty of suspending our own cultural lens that is the things that are important to us when examining the experiences of another. Indeed, our partici, participants are often sensitive to these issues and may filter information in the process. To bring this issue more to light, uhm, let me, let me illustrate this through some of the work that, uhm, some of my colleagues are doing on a project entitled, "Meaning Making in the Lives of Holocaust Survivors: Exploring Spirituality, Relationships and Identity.

00:33:30
LISA A. SUZUKI Uhm, we also have been, uhm, working with the Museum of Jewish Heritage who are helping us with the project. And we also have some community brokers and informants who, uhm, have experienced with holocaust survivors both personally and professionally. As you readily note, none of the, in my research team members are Jewish. On numerous occasions, participants would ask a White team member, "You're Jewish, aren't you?" but they didn't seemed to be bothered when the answer was no. We are fortunate to obtain the support of the education director at the Museum of Jewish Heritage who sent out invitations to members of the speakers bureau to participate in the study. The letter of orientation read, "The study focuses on forgiveness, virtuality, intergenerational trauma specifically regarding the holocaust and how meaning has been created in holocaust survivors lives." We had a lot of work to do prior to engage in interviews. We met with Elizabeth Edelstein and Brana Gurewitsch who provided information, provide the excessive information regarding the holocaust and answered questions regarding how to approach survivors. They noted that many of the survivors had written books about their experiences during the holocaust and given that we weren't looking, that we weren't looking to document these experiences again, they stretched the importance of reading the books prior to the interviews and bringing the texts with us to the interview noting that we had actually read it. We now have a collection of autograph texts written by our participants. We learned that bri, that intrements(ph) cakes are kosher, uhm, and we brought one to each interview. The team has a ranked list of which cakes we like better so far it is the raspberry strudel. We piloted the interview with a psychologist whose parents were both holocaust survivors and realized how difficult it was to hear the stories of survival related to our questions. We also had a faculty from the Department of Jewish Studies, review the interview protocol. So, finally after all, after a long time of preparation, about six or seven months, the invitations were sent and we sat back to see who respond. Our target number was 20 and we knew that only approximately 60 invitations would be sent out. I was thrilled when the phone began to rang, ring. I found that I was called upon repeatedly to talk about my own background and answer the question of, "Why are you doing this?" I was not speaking to academics where I believe would immediately see the importance of the topic. My answers were often vague and had to do with the importance of documenting reflections of their experience and what let them to share the stories with others. In addition, how they copes and made sense of their experience, may and probably would have an impact on how we understand the experiences of other trauma survivors. Scheduling the interview at, interview appointments which I initially took on and Anne later took over, took nearly a half hour each as each participant share aspects of their lives with me. It was almost as if the process of data collection began with that first phone call. I was touched by the generosity of their spirit as well. I recall one person stating, "Dr. Suzuki, you're Japanese right?" I said, "Yes." "You probably don't hear many good things about your group," and as you know she was referring back to, you know, when the Japanese occupied various parts of Asia there were lots of atrocities committed et cetera. She said, "Well, let me tell you something. When the war broke out, some other Jews went to Japan. Remember, Japan was an ally of the Nazis. They wanted them to send the Jews back but the Japanese government said no. That's something passive about your group that you should remember." I also remembered discussing my excitement about the project at a party with a Jewish woman and her response was a bit of a shock after the welcoming phone calls I had engaged in. "Weren't your people putting concentration camps, too? Why don't you study them?" I fumbled out of response saying the work of, well, you know, uhm, I have a colleague Donna Nagato(ph) that has done extensive work with internees et cetera at the University of Michigan and, uhm, she seems satisfied with this response and proceeded to talk about other work that she knew about related to the holocaust. Over the past four months, we have received calls from over 40 survivors. We've been welcomed to their homes for the interviews and we originally timed the interviews. We anticipated one and a half to two hours. What we found is that the interviews actually take three to five hours. Participants brought videos, artifacts, et cetera to share with us. They email us articles and send materials. Well, not written into our methodology we have had calls from participants asking us to interview their friends. It was so good for me and I know it will help her, too. We went to their homes, it wasn't unusual for us to see certificates, photos, and thank you letters from students and others who have been touched by their stories. We send certificates to them with our thank you letters. In addition, we have heard from our Museum supported Dr. Eliz, Elizabeth Edelstein regarding how much the participants have enjoyed the meeting and how grateful they are that we traveled long distances to meet with them and how nice we are. We have now completed most of the interviews and we continue to hear from our participants. Oh, thanks. I think about how the research has impacted me as well as other members of the team. We discussed how the stories had infiltrated our dreams. The images of the bestiality of the intreatment(ph) that are su, participants injured, it was difficult not to be touched by their immense sense of lost and the triumph of their survival. After listening to the stories shared from participants working in children, I gathered my daughter closer in my arms thinking about how she was the exact age of the person I just interviewed during the war who had to hide in the bookshelf and a trunk for hours at that time without food or drink. As I ate meals and saw the amount of food thrown in the garbage, after the meal I thought about how so many survivors talked about hunger and the value of bread that they ate made from sawdust. Their words affected me then as they do now. It is one consultants the project noted despite the depth of a sharing and openness to the community, we're still the other. Indeed, he pointed out the stories quite a bit different if we were Jewish. The participants see us as the other and, therefore, perhaps, a possible enemy. The questions regarding how the information will be used and what will become of the stories that they share were often the first questions asked when we arrived to interview them. We are still visitors who hope to become guests welcomes into the most inner sanctums of the participants life to observe that which is not readily observable. As Harvey writes, "Researchers cannot ever entirely take-for-granted what is self-evident to their hosts. Even when hosts are self-reflexive and happy to theorize about their lifestyle and/or practice, they are more securely 'at home' with themselves than visiting researchers will ever be." There are many times during the interviews when I would have a hot experience where things seem to fit together and I felt the set of enlightenment. Of course, I had, I had a glimpse into something that I hadn't read or expected to hear. Our consultants are culture brokers served to bring a seamless of understanding to contradictions in the data. Pratchett noted that the researcher must acknowledge the change that which they research (however, they do it) as well as themselves. This project is clearly impacted me as well as others on the team. The process has changed us and how we view the history of the world and the pain that can be inflicted by others in power. In addition, the process of research study has impacted participants when described the interview as therapeutic. Others have asked for copies of their digital recordings so they can share those with their grandchildren and children. Others have had their grandchildren and family friends present at the interview so they could hear their story. How the story is told through the framework of the interview questions and how they are asked changes the aspects of the story. So, we constructed our research from the stands of an ins, we con, we conducted our researcher from the stands of an insider whom we study aspects of our own community and outsiders whom we study the communities of others with whom we do not share critical aspects of identity. It was important to note that the role of the insider research is a complex one giving multiple identities that exist simultaneously in the researcher as well as participants. As I read earlier, cultures are dynamic and can flow a different directions within the same community.

LISA A. SUZUKI So, where to next? As I began writing this final section of the talk, I felt as though I was ending in the same quandary and confusion as I started. How do we gain an understanding of cultures different from our own or even in terms of understanding our own cultures when they're so dynamic and fluid? As a part of this question, I thought another passage of Geertz. "Cultural analysis is intrinsically incomplete. And worse than that, the more deeply it goes the less complete it is. It is a strange science whose most telling assertions are its most tremulously based, in which to get somewhere with a matter at hand is to intensify the suspicion, both your own and that of others, that you are not quite getting it right." Qualitative research methods provide us with a means to gain thick description to understand the lived(ph) experience of others. In order to accomplish this-

Take Home Message Understand our own context Understand cultures in context - political, economic, historical, etc. Gather data outside the box - move beyond the spoken word Move from visitor to guesthood to ally Work towards the betterment of the lives of others (social justice) 

00:42:50
LISA A. SUZUKI - we must understand our own context that which creates the cultural lens through which we view the culture of another. Even in cases where we are studying our own communities, when we assumed the role of reporter, documentor or phenomenon of a, of phenomenon our relationship to our own culture prove changes. We are neither invisible nor neutral, we are participants who need interactions in communities we study. So, we must be aware of our many social identities and how did it impact the process of inquiry. And I'm almost done. In order to gain culture understanding, we must not only rely on the spoken word. Language can be viewed as a carrier of the culture but is only one representation of cultural knowledge. An over reliance on the spoken word, oral or written, in the absence of other data can lead us astray. We must move beyond to establish relationships with community members. We cannot be just visitors or as Dr. Trimble talked about the parachuter that comes in to gather data and then parachutes out. We must extend ourselves and openly commit to a process of engagement and collaboration. We can turn to the discipline of anthropology to provide an illustrations of deep and sustained commitment to communities. Obviously maybe not, not all the examples but it is important for the veracity of our findings that we move in relationship from visitor to guesthood and perhaps even to ally. A psychologists, counselors, and educators are work towards understanding the lives of others should include research that make things better. (applause) Thanks.
