JOHN GOTTMAN Okay, so I would like to talk to you now about children. I started life as, professional life as a child psychologist and… So about 19… When was it? 1976 uh, I moved to the University of Illinois and one of the things that I have been studying from the time I, I was, I began as a professor was trying to understand how children make friends. And being a clinical, child clinical psychologist I was really concerned about kids who got bullied and rejected by other kids and kids who are socially isolated. And I had experienced when I was in high school, I started ninth grade at the age of 12 instead of 14 and my parents had just moved to this new community in New Jersey. And so I had four years in high school where I was bullied. And, you know, I, I, I found that after high school when I went to college in New Jersey I found it very easy to make friends uh, but, you know, I was very interested in, you know, what do we know? What does, what does psychology know about how children make friends? It turned out that there was no research on it. Nobody had actually studied this. How do children make friends? How do children get included in groups? Umm… And there was a guy who was a behavior therapist who had made a film designed to teach kids how to, how to get included into groups so they got accepted rather than rejected. And his name was Michele uh, Michele Rainer I believe. And so I got in touch with him because I was really curious about his film and he sent a copy of his film. He was very nice about it. And, and he, he was teaching kids who were four and five year olds, you know, to go up to a group and introduce themselves like an adult would and say, "Hi, my name is Tommy. And I would like to be a part of your group and I want to tell you about some things about me. I want to tell you about some things that happened to me. I want to tell you about some things that happened to me this morning on the way to school." And this kid would, you know, talk about himself and that was this guy's film, was training these kids to do that. And I thought, you know, I don't really feel comfortable using this film because we don't know how kids naturally go about this process. So, you know, just like we did for studying couples, where we looked at the masters and the disasters I wanted to see, are there some kids who are masters are getting included into groups and are there some kids who are disasters? And so we had to do that research again, you know, studying kids at different ages. You know, and filming in second grade classrooms and, you know, I worked with filmmakers to make these films and it turned out that when we did the research that this film taught kids to do exactly what they needed to get rejected by other children. So this guy had it totally backwards, right, because… And I asked him, how did you develop this film? And he said, "Well, my graduate students and I just sat around one day and tried to remember what it was like to be four-years-old." Well, he didn't have a very good memory of what is like to be four because the kids who became easily accepted into groups did the opposite. They didn't call attention to themselves, they just kind of sat down or they did what the other kids in the group were doing and they kind of joined in, you know, very quietly imitating what kids were doing and eventually, you know, sort of became part of the group. And, you know, so it turned out that again, research was very necessary. I was also really curious about, you know, because we had learned that even if kids are, are socially rejected or not accepted by other kids, if you can make one really great friend, one close friend… And I had one friend in high school, guy named Larry. He is still my friend and we have been friends for almost 60 years now. He is a psychiatrist in New York. And Larry was my only friend in high school. But research has shown that if you can, if you can have one best friend, you are fine in terms of mental health, you know, you're really gonna be okay. So I was really curious, curious about how kids made friends. And so again, this began a whole set of research studies, just tape recording and watching kids with their best friends and making friends with other kids. A whole lot of research led to that. Now it turns out to be a very interesting area because not only are, you know, our love relationships really important for our mental health. You know, when I said, longevity and physical health and immune system, how much you learned and how your kids turn out are really depended on whether you can create a loving a relationship, you know. So this is a very powerful thing. Well, it turns out also that epidemiologists have been studying health and how long people live and longevity. And a guy name Len Syme and his student Lisa Berkman at Berkley started studying this thing and they really were interested in cholesterol, you know, because they thought cholesterol levels in the blood would really determine heath. And what they found was that in fact, it's not cholesterol that determines health, it's not really diet that determines health, it's not really exercise that determines health, although diet and exercise are important factors and cholesterol is important but what really determines health is whether you have good friends, which is really amazing. So they did this study called the Alameda County study and they found that the people who live longer are people who can really make friends and maintain friends. And the people who die very young are people who are socially isolated. And this is to everywhere on the planet. So friendship turns out to be really important. Okay, now let's get back to children. If you wanted to predict how your kids are gonna turn out as adults, where should you look? And initially psychologists were thinking the IQ test that's it. You have an intelligent kid, they are resilient, they are buffered, they will be fine. And it turns out intelligence is not that great a predictor of how kids turn out in life. What does predict? Well, it turns out what predicts is the ability to delay gratification. The ability to wait. The ability to postpone immediate rewards and regulate your emotions and wait for the right opportunity so you can maximize your reward. So a guy named Walter Mischel created this marshmallow test in which he offered four-year-olds one marshmallow they could eat now but if they waited 15 minutes and that's a long time for a four-year-old to wait, they get two marshmallows. And you can watch this on YouTube if you'd really like to see it. But kids sit there and they are really trying not to eat that marshmallow and they do things like… And they poke at it and they smell it and they put it away and then they look at the ceiling and, you know, and some kids eat the marshmallow right away, you know, even after that struggle and some kids wait 15 minutes and they two marshmallows. And then you could see those kids, boy, they eat those two marshmallows really fast now. They go right in there and eat them. Well, Walter Mischel contacted these kids 20 years later. So now they are 24-years-old. It turns out the kids who waited for the two marshmallows are doing really well in every aspect of their lives. Their relationships, they have good jobs, they are successful and in every aspect of life, you know. This ability to regulate your own emotions turned out to be very critical. Well, that's exactly what kids need in order to make a friend, all right. Because what it takes to really make friends, even if you are three and four-years-old is to be able to understand what your friend needs to be able to harmonize with your friend, right, to be able to go along with what your friend wants sometimes, but also to be strong and assertive. So there's this back and forth thing that requires tremendous emotion regulation and what developmental psychologists call theory of mind, the ability to see that other people have a different mind than you do, okay. So, SO what's that about? You know, this… What relates to kids being able to make friends? So in 1980 we started studying not only marriages at, but parenting relationships with three and four-year-old kids and also how those kids made friends with other children their same age, okay. So we put it all together in a study and what we found was that there was one dimension that in parents that we could study in a laboratory that we called meta-emotion. And this idea of meta, m-e-t-a emotion is how people feel about feelings. So psychologists use that term meta uh, to be sort of reflexive. And so meta-cognition is how we think about our thinking. Meta-communication is how we communicate about our communication. And meta-emotion is how we feel about feelings. So, you know, people all over the planet have the same set of emotions, everywhere, and it doesn't matter if they don't have television or newspapers. You can go to uh, the, the Highlands of Sumatra and study the Bukittinggi, you know, the Binaan Kabel culture in Bukittinggi and, you know, even these people had no television and they still experience sadness in the same way, they still experience anger in the same way, grief in the same way, surprise. All the basic emotions are the same for everybody throughout the planet. And Charles Darwin, you know, would recognize that in a book he wrote in 1872 but it's turned out to be true. So physiologically, you know, we're all the same in terms of emotions all through out the planet. But our cultures are very different in how they feel about feelings. So for example in Northern Ireland and I had a client from northern island and in Northern Ireland, you know, this guy was raised as a Protestant in Northern Ireland and his family and his whole neighborhood they really didn't express affection. They didn't touch each other, he never saw his parents kiss, he never was affectionate with his friends, there was never any physical affection in the family. So when this guy married, when he came to America and married an American he was in lot of trouble, right, because she wanted him to hold hands with her in public, she wanted a lot of kissing, she wanted a lot of affection, and he was very uncomfortable with affection, right. So for example in Norway they believe that you should not ever tell a child positive things about that child's accomplishments. So if you have a child who is a great violinist, you do not in Norway invite your neighbors in and have your child play the violin for them, all right. They think that's really bad because you're gonna give a kid a swellhead, they are gonna get arrogant. They don't want anybody to fell inferior. So they are very concerned about not really expressing pride toward their children. So there's another cultural difference. And, you know, we know that a Chinese for example are very different in the way they socialize their kids. So cultures really differ enormously, and even families different enormously and have a feel about feelings. Sometimes they're even different in how they feel about anger, okay. So for example we interviewed one mother and she said, "Well, you know, in my family my mother was very depressed." And our father was kind of like a domineering guy. And so my sisters and I when we were really young we got together and we said, We're never gonna be sad. Sadness is bad because mom is always sad.' And so we decided we're gonna banish sadness and we are never gonna be sad." And this woman was like a crusader for important causes in Seattle, you know. She was a great crusader. She was all about justice. So when I asked her, "What do you do when, you know, your son gets sad? When Sammy gets sad?" She said, "When he gets sad I go for a run. I go jogging." And her husband takes over when Sammy is sad. He is okay with sadness, all right, but she has a lot of problems with sadness. So we called this concept meta-emotion. Finding out how people really feel about feelings. And that turns out to be very important. So for example one guy we interviewed, he said, "I hate it when people get angry with me." And so we asked him about that. "So what it is that like when people get angry with you?" And he said, "It's like they're relieving themselves in my face." To him anger and disrespect were the same thing, you know. So like they were peeing on his face, that's the way he felt about anger. So imagine how he would react if his kid got angry at him, all right. So his meta-emotion, his feeling about anger really determined the way he reacted to his children. And basically what we decided to do when we did this interview about how people feel about feelings, and when Julie and I started working with parents based on this research was we discovered that there really were two basic kinds of parents. This is an oversimplification but in general we found that there was one kind of parent whose history with emotions and philosophy was what we called emotion dismissing. These people did not notice lower intensity emotions in themselves or their children. Like, I'll give you an example. One family interview, I said, "Well, how do you respond when your daughter Jessica gets sad?" And husband and wife turned toward each other and she said, the mom said, "I don't know. Has Jessica ever been sad?" And her husband said, "I think she was sad that one time when she went to visit grandma and grandpa by herself on the airplane." So that's the only time they had noticed Jessica being sad. Now I guarantee you Jessica was sad many times during every day. She had moments when the crayon broke and she felt little sad. But it had to be a really big sadness for these parents to notice it. So they also saw negative emotion, anger, sadness, fear, as if they were poisons, toxins and they wanted to present, prevent their children from even having these negative emotions, and they wanted their children to be cheerful. So they really thought the longer a child stays in a negative emotion the more toxic these negative emotions are gonna be. So they, they were impatient with children who had negative emotions. And then they might even punish a child just for being angry even if there is no misbehavior. They believe that accentuating the positive in life. And kind of had this philosophy like their emotions are sort of like a jacket you wear like. You know, I put on this jacket this morning, okay, it's kind of like if emotions are like a jacket you choose to wear, why would you ever choose to wear a sad jacket or an angry jacket or fearful jacket? Choose a cheerful jacket, a happy jacket, an optimistic jacket. That's the way they deal with emotions, like it was a choice. Kind of like Norman Vincent Peale's idea in his book "The power of positive thinking." This is a very American view, but it's not just American, even the Dalai Lama talks about being happy in terms of deciding to have a cheerful, optimistic view. And you hear that from a lot of psychologists, and you see it in science fiction movies like Doom. Fear is the mind killer, that's one of the mottos in the science fiction movie. Fear is bad, all right, these negative emotions are bad. So don't have fear, because if you, if you get rid of your fear, you will be a brave courageous person, all right. Even the Nike sneaker company has the ad "Just do it," right. Don't think about whether you want to do it or not, how you feel about doing it, just do it, because if you start thinking about how you feel about it, you might not do it, then you won't be a champion. You won't be successful like these athletes who wear our sneakers because they just get out and do it, right. This is the emotion dismissing point of view. And so they will distract the child, tickle the child, do anything to get a child out of a negative mood. Umm… Okay, now emotion coaching was the other approach we found in parents. And this was a very different approach to kid's emotions. And let me give an example. So here's an emotion coaching father we interviewed uh, and he says, you know, "If a kid was mean to my son" and this is a four-year-old, all right "I try to understand what he is feeling and why. Some kid may have hit him or made fun of him. I just stop everything then, my heart goes out to him and I feel like a real father, I empathize." An emotion dismissing father said, talked about a similar thing. He said, "If my son has a problem with other kids, let's say somebody took something of his I say, 'hey don't worry about it. He didn't mean it. He will bring it back. Don't dwell on it. Take it lightly, roll with the punches, get back with life.'" And this is the whole message. Minimize negative things and get over them. And, you know, that's the example of the dismissing versus the coaching. But emotion coaching parents really seem to be till the end to their own emotions and the emotions of their children. So they notice negative emotions and positive emotions in their, in themselves and in their children. So the kids don't have to escalate it and make it a big display in order to get noticed. They also see these emotional moments as an opportunity for intimacy and teaching with their child as a healthy part of development. So when their kid is sad or angry or afraid they think that's normal and natural and, you know, they will take their kid to see a sad movie, even a sad kid movie and want them to experience those emotions. They also communicate understanding and empathy. And interestingly enough, even if there is misbehavior, they will empathize with the feelings behind the misbehavior. So they basically are communicating to their kids all feelings and wishes are accepted. But not all behavior is acceptable. So they really set limits on behavior, right, and they can say, "You know, I can understand why you get angry at your brother. He makes me angry sometimes. You know, and we don't agree with what he did. He kicked over your blocks, you know, but it's not okay for you to go and kick him, and hit him, and bite him. You know, we don't do that in this family." So they set limits on misbehavior but they can empathize with the emotions behind the misbehavior, right. Communicating to their child that all feelings and wishes are acceptable. And then, you know, if there wasn't misbehavior, if it was just like, for example, fear that the child was feeling. The empathy would then extend to problem solving. You know, helping the kid figure out, you know, how to, how to deal with being afraid, how to deal with being sad when there is no misbehavior. And they were also were not impatient and waited for their child to come up with his or her own strategies. So one of things we discovered was the emotion dismissing and emotion coaching parents are very different in the way they teach their children something new, which we did in the laboratory. So the parents learned how to play those videogame and then we have them teach the kids the same video game. Now the real problem is, in doing this research is, how do you keep a kids attention through all these laboratory tasks? So we actually set up this, we created this mock space capsule and the kids wore astronaut uniforms and they were astronauts in the space capsule and they did stuff that astronauts would do. So the video game the parents learned had to do with stuff that astronauts would do. And once the parents learned the game we asked them to teach their children how to play the game. And emotion dismissing parents we discovered from an honors thesis by Vanessa Kahen teach in a particular way. The emotion dismissing parents gave their kids a lot of information and then they stood back and waited for their kids to make a mistake, and then they came in and corrected their children, okay. So doesn't that sound like the critical, the four horsemen, one of the horsemen is criticism, right. Scanning the environment for people's mistakes. That's what these people were doing not only in their marriages but now when they were teaching their kids something they waited for their kid to do something wrong and then came in and corrected. So they felt parental when they were correcting their kid's mistakes. The emotion coaching parent really was different. They gave their kids much less information, just enough for the kid to get started and then they hung back and they waited for their kids to do something right and then they came in and said, "You are getting it" and they praised their kid and then they gave them a little more information. Well, you could actually look at the kids' performance on the game, we could score it. And the criticism, kids' performance went down. So when you point out people's mistakes when they are first learning something new it really messes them up, but if you point out what they are doing right their score goes up and up. So this teaching was much more effective that the emotion coaching parents were doing. So here what was going on in the marriages, one of the four horsemen really generalized to the way they were relating to their children. Okay, now, not only that but the metaphors, you know, the language that people used when they were dismissing versus coaching was very different. So emotion dismissing people view anger and use explosive metaphors like, you know, you blow up when you get angry, you know, it's, you explode when you get angry. You lose control, you can become aggressive. Anger is the same as aggression and violence to these dismissing people. Anger is a really terrifying thing. Where as emotion coaching people kind of viewed anger as just something natural, not a big deal. You know, you get angry when, you know, when you're trying to accomplish a goal and you get frustrated. It's natural to get anger. So there's information, good information in anger for emotion coaching people. What's frustrating you and what's your goal? Right. So they are asking their kids, "Okay, you are angry, so what's your goal here? What's frustrating you?" But emotion dismissing people are saying this anger is dangerous. Same thing with sadness. Emotion dismissing parents really saw sadness as people wallowing in their self pity as passivity, in action. And even related to mental illness, and death, and depression. That's what sadness was to emotion dismissing. Again, sadness is a, is a scary thing if you are emotion dismissing whereas emotion coaching parents would say, "Well, no, sadness is just a part of life. It means something is missing in your life or you've lost something. Figure out what it is. You know, figure out what's missing." So it's good information in sadness. Fear for emotion dismissing parents was viewed as potentially cowardice and inaction. Being a wimp, being a failure, that's what fear was about. So when they saw their kid be afraid, particularly their boys be afraid they were saying, "Oh, my kid's gonna, you know, grow up to be a coward." Whereas emotion coaching parents were saying, "Well, if you're afraid then probably means that your world doesn't feel safe to you. Let's figure out, you know, what's gonna make your world safer." In other words dismissing parents saw negative emotions as leading nowhere, as being worthless and you should dismiss it and expurgate it from your life. Just get it out of your life. And, you know, if, if it happens, just roll with the punches, you know, get up like a boxer whose been hit. You know, just get up again and fight, all right. Whereas really emotion coaching parents are saying, "You know, you know, every emotion has information in it." Really emotions are your GPS in life, all right. It give you, gives you direction. If you know how you are feeling and you could figure out why you are feeling that way and you could go toward things that you love and really, you know, understand what it is that you are reacting to in a negative way. And so, also emotion dismissing parents had a really different view about thinking about your feelings, introspecting, looking inside. They kind of viewed it with metaphors like throwing gasoline on an open fire. You know, if you dwell on it, you know, you are really asking for trouble. You know, don't go inside. Don't ever go to therapy because if you go to therapy, you're just gonna become mentally ill. The therapist is gonna, you know, just look too deep and it's dangerous. Whereas emotion coaching parents are saying, "No, you know, think about what you feel because there's good information in it." Now what's different about this in terms of its approach to parenting? Well, if you, if you really go to a library or to a bookstore and read stuff about parenting. Ninety nine percent of the books are about discipline, okay. And, you know, and they, and they're addressed to parents who feel out of control. They have explosive kids, you know, there's books talking about the explosive child. Well, isn't that emotion dismissing. It's an explosive metaphor or, you know, the difficult child, the burden, the child that burdens you. You got to get control over these impulses. Well, if you are successful in all these books, you read them and you study them, what you will turn out to have is obedient children. And, you know, that's good. I mean, everybody wants cooperative, obedient children but most of us want so much more from our children and for our children than that. We want our children to be able to think for themselves, even disagree with us, right. So, you know, my daughter, she said to me, "Where am I gonna go when I die?" So four-year-olds start thinking about death. And she said, "Where am I gonna go when I die?" And I said, "I don't know." And she said, "You can tell me." And I said, "Do you think grownups know everything?" And she said, "Yes." So I said, so I started coming up with things that I wanted, I wanted her to disagree with me. So I said, "You know, I could be a girl if I wanted to." She said, "No, you can't." I said, "Yes, I can. I can get a wig and have long hair and I can wear dresses." And she said, "You would still be a boy." I said, "Why?" And she said, "Well, you have a penis." I said, "Well, I can get a sex change operation." "You would still be a boy." And so she started disagreeing with me and after a while she said, "You know," she came to me and she said, "You know, I figured out something about how you are different from mom." And I said, "How?" She said, "Well, mom knows everything and you know nothing." So I've been successful, right, getting her to disagree with me. We want our kids to be compassionate human beings. We want our kids to be moral people, right, to have a value system that we can admire, you know, to treat people well, to have good relationships with others, to select the partner that won't beat them up, right. You know, have good choices in the people they select when they partner up with somebody. Have good social judgment to enjoy their talents, to, to explore their abilities, to be proud of themselves but not boastful, to have purpose and meaning in their lives, to have interests and self-esteem and to look for something beyond themselves, to care about people and much, much more, right. We want all these things for our children and even more. And the bottom line is you cannot get any of that in the discipline situation. So 99 percent of these books that are about parenting, they really don't get any of those goals, they don't help us accomplish all the things we want for our children. So I want to tell you about my research because I wound up discovering and rediscovering the wisdom of a great child psychologist named Haim Ginott who wrote in the 1960s and he died prematurely of cancer. But he really figured this out on his own without doing any research. And I wound up rediscovering what he actually talked about. And what he said was, the only way you can accomplish these goals are to focus on the magical moments. And what are those magical moments? They are moments when your kid has an emotion, that's the time to notice that and interact. And he said, "What's different about the way I need to talk to children?" And he said, "The answer is that your language must be evaluative and not judgmental." Not be evaluative and judgmental. For example child is blowing bubbles in a glass of milk, okay, and then, you know, the bubbles go over and there is milk that spills on the counter. Now instead of saying I told you to be careful, you are so clumsy. Ginott said, "You say, I see the milk spilled. Too bad, here's a rag." Okay. So that's really a non-evaluative, non-judgmental approach because what Ginott said is labeling a child is disabling. Labels are disabling. The danger being that kids will believe us if we call them lazy or stupid or careless or clumsy. These labels are potentially harmful because they set up expectations that the child will say, "Well, my dad thinks that I'm stupid and clumsy. So what am I supposed to do? I guess I have to be the best stupid and clumsy kid I can be because my dad must be right about me." And Ginott also said that, having too high expectation also are disabling. Instead, describe what you see and how you feel. So a child, you know, draws something and you can say, "Well, I see you've drawn a purple house and lots of flowers. It makes me feel like I'm in the country." Instead of saying "You are such a great artist." Okay, so that labels and labeling a child both on the positive end and the negative end are disabling. So praise is really effective if it's specific. If it's about saying, "You know, I saw that you cleaned up the yard and that makes me feel really great about the yard. It looks wonderful, you did a great job." As opposed to saying, "You are so terrific." In other words what Ginott said was that the way you relate to the kid is everything. You can only create kindness in a child by treating the child in a kind manner. You can only create respectfulness in a child by treating the child with respect for the child. You can only create empathy in a child for other people by treating that child with compassion. So you model the very things that you want. Instead of saying, "What is wrong with you? You're so stupid to treat your guest in a rude manner." Because when you say those things you are treating your child in a rude manner and you are modeling that. Instead of saying, "This will teach you not to hit somebody" and hit your kid, right, then you are modeling violence. You teach the opposite of what you want. So Ginott gave an example of the teacher reading a sensitive poem and this little boy Stuart is just, you know, cutting up and, you know, making everybody laugh and the teacher says, "Stuart, Stuart, will you sit down right now or are you just naturally slow?" So the teacher humiliates this child in front of the other children. And he is not listening to the rest of what she says. He is actually engaged in planning the details of her funeral, right. That's what he is thinking about. I would like to attend her funeral. Kids really have a heightened sense of dignity. They are very well aware of the fact that they are short. And if you listen to the conversations kids have with one another, they often talk to one another about what they used not to be able to do and what they could do now. They are very concerned, particularly boys about being little and getting bigger and they have mixed feelings about getting bigger. They want to be more powerful but they also really want to be taken care of. Now this idea of the heightened sense of dignity, let me give you an example of this. So, Haim Ginott was, he never had children of his own, you know, unfortunately but he was an uncle. So he was visiting his family in Israel and he was sleeping in, in the den. You know, they didn't have a guest room. And his nephew comes in bouncing a basketball and he says to his nephew, he says, "Harry, I'm trying to take a nap. Would you please stop bouncing that basketball? I'm trying to sleep." So Harry bounces the basketball two more times and stops. And so Ginott says, "Why did he do that? Why did he bounce it two more times? Was he trying to provoke me? Was he trying to get me angry?" No, he was trying to show me that he was stopping of his own freewill, that he was respecting me, okay. So Ginott realizes that kids had this heightened need to save face. And here's an interesting thing, guy named Sam Vucinic at Oregon State University in Corvallis, a colleague of mine actually videotaped kids and parents at dinner time and he found that 75 percent of the time parents were the ones that started the arguments at dinner. Seventy five percent of the time it was the parents that started these battles and often the, the battles were really about food, you know. "Eat this food." "I don't want to eat it, it's disgusting." "You eat it. I made it for you, you eat it." You know. And the kid says, "It's like road kill, I don't want to eat this stuff." And they say, "Take two bites of the road kill." You know. And actually when you think about it kids really oppose their parents. We are in some ways the wet stone to their blade. You know, they sharpen themselves on us. So when the kid says, "I'm not eating that. The mash potatoes and the peas are touching one another. It's disgusting." They are really saying, "I'm the kind of kid that likes separate food. That's who I am." So if you say, "Okay, I'm gonna move them apart, there you go." Kid says, "All right, I'm the kind of kid who likes separate food and it's okay with my mom. I can have separate food, you know." That's respect, it's taking the kid's perspective and saying, "Okay." So, you know, and I, I remember one time, you know, sitting with my daughter when she was very young and she wanted to do something. And I, I found myself, catching myself in my mind because the first thing I thought in my mind was, "No. She wants to do something, no." And then I felt myself think, "Why. why am I saying no? That's sort of like what my parents were like. You know, saying no." Actually what she is wanting to do is totally reasonable. So I said, "Sure, you could do that." And I was real proud of myself because I stopped myself from saying no. And then I found I wanted to say no almost all the time to what she wanted to do. I was going, "What is that about me that I'm trying to… I don't feel parental unless I can say no to her." And God, I can be a really great dad by understanding why she wants to do something and say yes to her because she's really got very good ideas. Parents do a lot of harm by invalidating a kid's feelings. They do this to hold up a mirror to reality. Kid says, "My finger hurts." And the parent says, "Oh, that's such a small scratch." You know, that can't hurt anybody." Instead of saying, "Well, that's a small scratch but that really hurts you." Kid is running and says, "Oh, it's so hot in here." Parent says, "Don't be silly. It's not in here. It's always at 68 here." Instead of saying, "Well, it's hot in here for you right now, you know." Kid says, "You know, I'm really afraid to go to sleep in my room." "Oh, what are you scared of? There's nothing to be scared of." Now here is the danger. If we invalidate a kids intuitive feelings, then they are not gonna trust intuitions, right. And they are gonna doubt their own intuitions. So if a grownup says to kid, "Come into my car, I've got some candy for you." The kid's gonna be afraid but say, "Oh, you know, disregard my intuitions. Candy would be nice, all right." We want kids to trust their feelings. And fathers tend to be very confused about their sons' fear. So Julie and I were, you know, we are doing a group one time for parents and this father said, "Oh, my son is really afraid to go to sleep. He says, that there are monsters and this Tyrannosaurus Rex, you know, in, you know, in his room." And, you know, he said, "I don't want to get into this. I don't want to reinforce the fear. I don't want to sit with him." And so the group said, "Why don't you try just sitting with him? And ask him to give a tour of the monsters." Well, he came in the next week and he said, "You know, we turned off the lights and I sat there with my son on the bed and he said, 'Papa, there is Tyrannosaurus Rex' and by God the shadows looked just like Tyrannosaurus Rex." And so he said, "But I still don't want to give into my kid's fear. I don't want to reinforce the fear." And so the group said, "Well, why don't you try it? Why don't you try just asking him what he thinks should do?" And let's do an experiment. And in fact, you know, he said to his son, "Okay, what should we do about Tyrannosaurus Rex?" And he waited for a long time. And this little boy said, "Why don't we get my dinosaur book and read the part about Tyrannosaurus Rex?" So dad read the part about Tyrannosaurus Rex and he said, "Okay, you can go now. I'll go to sleep by myself." And the next night he thought, "Oh, maybe now he will go to sleep by himself." And his son said, "Dad, I'm still scared of Tyrannosaurus Rex." So he thought, "Oh, the group's wrong." So I went into his room and I said, "Okay, what should we do now?" And he said, "Get out the book about Tyrannosaurus Rex and I'll read the part." So his son had actually memorized that part on his own from hearing it so often. He read it out loud and then he said, "Okay, papa, you can go now." And that was it. Then he didn't need his dad anymore. It's hard to do that. It's hard for people to really realize that by reassuring a child, by comforting a child that they are not reinforcing fear, they are helping the child cope with fear and that emotional support is really a way of dealing with fear. And Julie is gonna take it from here.

JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Okay. So, you know, many of you may be thinking, "Oh, my God, how I'm gonna do this? Can I be an emotion coaching parent? Does it take, you know, a huge amount of skill? Does it take a lot of training? Do you have to be a social worker to be able to do this emotion coaching stuff?" But you know what? Think about it for a moment. The reality is that we already have a lot of these skills. For example, let's just say that you have a guest who comes over to your apartment and the guest leaves their hat. All right, so the guest leaves, what do you do? Do you call up your friend and do you say, "My God, you are inconsiderate. You are leaving your stuff all over my house. What's the matter with you?" Do we do that? No. We don't do that. We will say, "Gee, you know, you left your hat here. What would you like me to do with it? Do you want me to bring it to work tomorrow?" So we'll be kind, right? We will be polite. We are not always trying to teach a lesson to our friend. Let me give you another example. Let's say that you invited somebody over. Let's say you had a nice little, I don't know, dinner and you had a nice white tablecloth you put on your table and you served coffee after the meal, coffee and cream, okay. And one of your partners let's say Fred is kind of talking like this and he is waving the coffee all over the place and away goes the coffee and cream all over the tablecloth down on to the floor. How many of you spilled cream and left it there? Do you know what that smells like after about 24 hours? So you are freaking out. So you could say to your guest, "Oh, my God, you are destroying my home. What are you trying to do to me? Get out of here. You are not my friend anymore." We don't do that. We say, "Don't worry about it. It's no problem. I'll go run get…" You know, whatever your mother's remedy is to clean up the white table cloth, little salt maybe, white vinegar." And then, you know, with a little shaking hand you pour him another cup of coffee, right. So we know how to be kind, that's the point. So how come we can't be that way with our kids? Why can't we just listen to our kids, be pretty good at emotion coaching. Be a little more gentle with our kids. Well, we've got some agendas that get in the way. For example, you know, one of them is that we'll have this parental agenda for our kid like our kid should be a thrifty person and I want my kid to be a thrifty person no matter what. I want my kid to know the value of money. So let's say your kid comes home and you have, you know, been talking to your kid and your kid says, oh, guess what? You know, I took some of my hard earned money and I took Bobby out to lunch because he was feeling bad, okay. So you can handle that a couple of ways, right. If your parental agenda gets in there you can respond by saying, "What's the matter with you? You are spending all of your money. You are supposed to save your money. You are not supposed to spend your money." Or you can take that as a moment of potential emotion coaching, "How are you feeling about Bobby feeling down? What was that like to be Bobby's friend there and really try to be good to Bobby? What was that like for you? You see it as a moment of intimacy where Bobby is… Your, your child is telling you about Bobby, their reaction to Bobby, why they did what they did which in fact, may be something very good. They were actually exhibiting compassion. They were feeling kindly towards Bobby. It's something you can reinforce instead of letting that agenda get in the way, right? Right. I want to talk about another really important thing that gets in the way of emotion coaching. Let's talk about trauma for a moment. When people have been traumatized what do they do? They shut down their emotions. They try to put a big heavy thick blanket over their emotions and to be hyper-vigilant, right, and to not be vulnerable. So if you are not vulnerable, let's say you don't ever want to get hurt again. You don't ever want to get betrayed again. You don't ever want to be abused again. So you develop this nice thick steel shell and you hide behind it and you shutdown whatever little feelings maybe coming up inside of you which all of us have. They are hardwired in. They are organic. They are part of our brains, right. But you shutdown those feelings and you may shut them down for so many years that you yourself don't know what you are feeling. You don't know what you are feeling, you don't know what your kid is feeling as a result and you've kind of forgotten the names of those feelings. So you may see your child exhibiting something that looks like some kind of distress but because… And you feel something stirring inside of you in response to it but because you don't want to feel you shut it down inside yourself then you try and shut it down in your kid so your kid won't make you feel something you don't want to feel. That's something that a lot of us do. It's a very, very common response to a negative history, to trauma, to multigenerational trauma. So part of what we really need to do in order to be good emotion coaching parents is to allow ourselves to recognize our own feelings and that's not always easy. We have to know what our own feelings are. What does sadness feel like? What does fear feel like? What does anger feel like? What does joy feel like or disgust or surprise? What are those essential feelings? What do they feel like? Because the only way that you can really emotion coach your child is to resonate with them in terms of your own feelings. You have to be able to not only recognize, ah, here's a moment where I might really connect with my child but you have to help your child especially younger ones to label their own emotions. How can you do that if you don't know what you are feeling, right? There is a wonderful book called "Focusing" by Eugene Gendlin. It's called Focusing, it's by Eugene Gendlin, G-E-N-D-L-I-N. That's a book that is really very helpful. It's kind of a dry read but it's really helpful in terms of helping people connect with themselves, connect with their own inner world, their own feelings so that they can name their own feelings. So let me give you an example. There was a guy who had an alcoholic father. He had been raised in Scotland and his father was very, very violent, very alcoholic. And when his father would come home drunk he would slowly withdraw, leave through the back door and run to the fields next door so that he wouldn't get in his father's path, okay. Well, later on he didn't know when his child expressed fear. He didn't know why that upset him so much. What was that about he had no idea? So here's what Gendlin counsels. Gendlin says, "First of all identify what's in your body? What's going on in your body? Do you feel tightness in your lungs? Do you feel short of breath, tightness here or do you feel like oh, your stomach is really tight, your diaphragm is tight? Do you feel like you've been kicked in the gut? Do you feel your jaw clinching? Do you feel yourself spacing out a little bit, kind of disassociating a little bit?" Those feelings in your body are the indicators of emotions. Maybe you feel tension in your fist or your shoulders start moving up, that's where fear is going on. You can look at somebody and if their shoulders are going up, that's fear. If you see somebody curving their bodies in like this, those shoulders are curving in, that's usually sadness, sadness. When you see somebody jutting their chin out this, clenching their teeth, well, that might be anger. That might be some anger. So our bodies and what are bodies are doing tell us what we are feeling. So once you've identified your own body's signature for a particular feeling, then all you have to do is see what your child is doing, see what your child is, listen to what your child is saying and then pay attention to your own body. Aha, there is the signal for my sadness. I bet my child is feeling sad. Because when we love our kids we end up mirroring in our own emotions what our kids are feeling. Then you know your kid's probably feeling sad or if you feel yourself going like this as your kid is talking to you, your kid is probably expressing fear. That's how you can know that you're really trying to emotion coach a child who is scared, you see. So you pay attention to your body that way and the signals that your body is giving you, then put words to it, put words to it. When you feel those things in your body try and think of what experience may have been the origin of that feeling in your body. That experience then can lead you to what you are feeling. What would you feel if your father came in roaring drunk and, you know, with the back of his hand what are you gonna feel? Of course, you are gonna feel afraid. You may feel some anger too or you may feel defiant. There may be some different things you feel. Pay attention to the body, then when your kid is doing that you will be able to help your child, right? Right. Okay. All right, another, another reason that we really struggle with being good emotion coaches is that we may want to turn everything into a fable or into a lesson. We want to turn everything into a lesson. So your kid comes home and your kid says, "Oh, God, I did terrible in this test. I did terrible." Well, you might immediately jump in and say, "You know, when I was your age I failed in school but what I did is I picked myself up and I decided I would study even harder for the next test. And then I got an A in the class. Ta-da." So what does your kid get out of that? "Oh, no, the, the parent doesn't understand me at all. The parent has judgment of me not doing so well and the parent expects me to be just like her. Not gonna happen." So it pushes your kid away instead of drawing your child closer and that's not what we want. We don't want to push our kid away, right? Right. Okay, the last reason that gets in the way of being a good emotion coach is that we, we live in one of the most uh, emotionally insensitive dismissing cultures on the face of the planet. And believe me John and I have been teaching all over the place, all over the world and we are pretty bad at recognizing emotions. It's amazing. We don't believe for example that men should feel fear, right? Men should not feel fear, men should not feel sad, boys should not feel pain, boys should not feel anxious. Can boys feel anything? Yes. They get to feel one thing and that's anger. Hurray, source of power, they get to feel anger. Meanwhile what are girls allowed to feel? Well, very little. They get to take care of everybody else. They get to be sad sometimes or little vulnerable. Maybe they get to be a little nervous or little scared about stuff. Do girls get to feel angry? What do you think? How many girls, women in this room felt that it was okay to be angry as kids? Raise your hands. Yeah, two. Two, right. Okay. Of the guys in this room, how many guys thought it was fine to express fear? Any? No. See what I mean. Get it. I mean, it's incredible. It's incredible. So the reality is what do we have to do to fit into this culture? Where? You know, you're supposed to basically have a… I don't know what, some kind of brain ectomy. Cut out, you know, little lobotomy or something. Cut out, men, you cut out everything but anger. Women, you can have everything but anger. Cut out the anger. How does that make sense when we are hardwired to have all of them? So every single emotion that's hardwired into use is hardwired into our children. And the more our children can really be aware of those feelings the more they will be sensitive to other individuals who are having those feelings, the better relationships they will have, the more empathic they will be et cetera. So let's review for a moment what are the five steps of emotion coaching? Okay, so here are the five steps of emotion coaching. Number one, recognize that your child is having an emotion, and it might be something very subtle. For example, let's say usually when your kid comes through the door at the end of the day they are bouncing, they are cheerful, they are talkative. One day they come in and they are very quiet. They don't say anything. What does that tell you? Your kid has had something happened that's not so good. Your kid is having some kind of negative emotion. So the first step is, recognize that your child is having some kind of feeling and emotion. What's the second step? The second step is recognize that "Hurray, my kid is having an emotion. This is an opportunity for connection with my child." A deeper time of connection. A lovely, warm, beautiful time for connection. That's step two. This is not a time to shutdown my child. This is not a time to push away my child and say, "I'm busy." This is a time to put your activities down, be with your child. Number three, third, talk to your child about what they're feeling. "What's going on, John? What's going on, Judy? What's happening? What's going on? What… Did something happened today? How are you feeling?" Recognize and ask, reach out to your child. "What's going on, honey? You look a little down. You look a little blue. What's happening?" So reach out to that child and ask them what's happened. What's going on? What are you feeling? That's step three. Step four, your child will tell you some stuff that's going on and your job is label the feeling for your child. Try to label the feeling. So let's say that your child is getting bullied at school. My daughter when she was very young like eight or nine or so, something like that, she had scoliosis. Do you guys know what that is? You know, the bent spine and stuff. And she had to wear this brace that went from here to here, 20 hours a day for six years. Okay, does that make you a popular kid? What's your guess? Probably not. So there was a boy in her class who was really a mean little kid, eight-years-old and that boy every now and then would kick her in the back. You know, do stuff like that. So when she came home she would say, "God, you know what? Talia kicked me in the back again." Oh, here's the next step, you validate the emotion. "That must have felt horrible, honey." And label it. "I bet that made you feel really sad. Did that hurt your feelings that she was treating you so badly?" "Well, yeah." "Gee. You know, it sounds kind of scary too. Did it scare you because that could really hurt?" So you draw out your kids feelings and validate them. "God, no wonder you felt that way. No wonder you felt scared. No wonder you felt terrible. That sounds really awful. What a bummer. Poor sweetheart." You validate those feelings. That is so important. The fifth step is problem solving. You got to problem solving or setting limits if your kid needs limit setting after the emotions, after you've talked about the emotions. So one mistake that parents will often make, I made that mistake too. Sometimes I still do with my older kid is this, a lot of times if your kid comes in and says, "Oh, God, you know, I just" for example "the teacher got really made at me at school and called me out in front of the whole class." What's your first thing gonna be? You're probably gonna say, "What did you do wrong?" Right? Okay, emotion coaching is totally different. Your kid is confiding in you. Recognize it as an emotion coaching moment, number one. Number two, it's a time for connection, ah. Number three, think about it in terms of, "What would my kid be feeling in that moment when the teacher called them out?" Well, the kid would probably feel embarrassed and humiliated and shamed, right. So you can say that. You label the feeling, label the feeling, step three. That must have been very embarrassing. Then your kid feels like you're an ally, you see. You are not just there to teach or to punish, you are there as an ally. That must have been so shaming, so embarrassing. "Gosh, I can imagine. That must have felt pretty horrible, honey?" And then the problem solving. "Is there a way that maybe you could avoid that happening in the future? What do you think you could do to avoid your teacher calling you out like that? What could you do to avoid that next time?" Problem solving, that's step five. But you don't do step five until you've done step one through four. Does that make sense? Your kid is gonna want to listen to you, want to talk to you only after they feel like you are their friend. You love them. You understand them. You are their ally. Then they will pay attention to the limit setting. Does that make sense? Yeah? Okay, so those are the five steps of emotion coaching. So in John's research here's what he did. He took all these kids who are four-years-old and he followed them depending on what parenting style they were receiving, whether it was dismissing or emotion coaching. And then he looked at them again, evaluated them at age eight. At age eight. So four years later. So listen to this difference. Listen to these results, it kind of blew our minds actually. I mean, we really didn't expect this. So first of all when they controlled, he controlled for IQ, meaning the kids in either the emotion dismissing group or the emotion coaching group. Umm… They had exactly the same overall IQ, so same intelligence. The kids at age eight who were emotion coached had much higher, significantly higher reading in math scores. They paid much better attention in class, that was teacher ratings. They had much more self soothing when they got upset. So they might get upset, they might just have a burst of emotion, but then they calm themselves down again. They didn't act stuff out. So they were calmer, they were calmer. They had what's called greater vagal tone. Let me tell you what vagal tone is. Vagal tone refers to the vagus which is this great big nerve bundle. It's the tenth cranial nerve that goes from the brain down to parts of the body, the organs of the body that kind of take care of all that involuntary stuff like our heart rate, our breathing rate, what our kidneys are doing, what our liver's doing, what out stomachs doing, things like that. The vagus controls all of that. And the vagus is like a muscle. If it's well toned and has good strength, then it will give, it will tell the whole body to have basically the a normal good response to whatever is upsetting but then it will self-sooth, the vagus will calm everything down again, slow down the breathing, slow down the heart rate. When you have lousy vagal tone you stay upset, much higher upset and upset forever. You are upset for a long time. You can't self-sooth. So these kids between four and eight who were emotion coached had much better vagal tone than the other kids. So they could self-sooth better, they could delay gratification, they could wait for that darn marshmallows, they will probably their, you know, 50-year-old researcher, you know, me at the time wouldn't be able to wait for the marshmallow because I hate delaying gratification. They had fewer behavioral problems, less depression, less acting out. This is all significant results. They had less infectious illnesses. Isn't that interesting? Because their systems weren't so stressed and their body was producing more lymphocytes which strengthen the immune system. And because their immunity was stronger with less stress they had fewer infectious illnesses. Umm… And as they got into middle school they could kind of psych out what was required in those social groups, right. So for example if one kid, you know, had a hat and another kid grabbed the hat and ran away with it, in middle school they knew they have the social moxie, you know, the social intelligence too to know that if they said, "Oh, that hurt my feelings that you took my hat." That wouldn't fly, not for a ten-year-old or nine-year-old, right. So they would say, "No, big deal. I got a lot of hats at home" which is exactly the right response for that middle school group, you see. So they had much more social intelligence. They knew how to handle social situations much better. Umm… They had much better peer relationships, so relationships with other kids. Umm… and one thing that also was really wonderful is that, you know how girls somehow we get the message as we get older that we are supposed to act dumb in order to get boys to like us. Remember that? I remember that. I really hated that one but I did it, right. So we call that the Ophelia syndrome. Well, girls who are emotion coached don't do it. They don't have the Ophelia syndrome. Is that so cool? So that's part of why those girls are accomplishing more. Why they are getting better grades et cetera. So, you know, the reality what we saw in the research, we didn't know how it would turn out but what we saw is that these emotion coached kids did so much better intellectually, in peer relationships, socially they did better in terms of their parent, being closer to their parents, less acting out, less delinquency, et cetera. So emotion coaching is very cool. And as the last thing what I'll mention is that a few years ago umm… we had a therapist who trained with us on emotion coaching and she was a psychologist from Korea, from South Korea, and she took emotion coaching into boys town orphanages in Korea. There were like a 1,100 kids being raised by these nuns and some priests. And there had been a pretty abusive system and lots and lots of orphans between the ages of birth and 18 who were just growing up in these orphanages with all kids of pretty awful stuff. Well, this woman who was just a dynamo introduced emotion coaching and taught the nuns and the priests in these orphanages with 1,100 kids to do emotion coaching with the kids. And things totally turned around. The kids were performing much better. The kids ended up forming, some of them forming a little orchestra that performed in Carnegie Hall it was like unbelievable, these Korean orphan kids. Umm… Also the sisters, the nuns as well as the priests were loving it because they felt closer to the kids than they had before when they just didn't have the tools to support the kids emotionally. So now umm… it so happens that the psychologist is married to a guy who's friends with the minister of education who's friends of course with the president of South Korea. South Korea is now mandating that all teachers in Korea learn emotion coaching for their classes. Now whether or not they will, who knows? But we may have a country there that's adopted emotion coaching which would be so cool and then we will see how they turn out, who knows? So anyway umm… I think that's it. So let's do this. Umm… Let's see, we have two exercises that we are gonna do with you that are just kind of interesting emotion coaching stuff in terms of your own worlds as well as the worlds of your kids. But let's take a break first for 15 minutes, then we will come back and do those two exercises and have Q and A time, okay. Ready? So here's what we are going to do next, everybody. Umm… take a look at this booklet. Everyone of you should have received this booklet, this lovely little booklet. And what I would like you to do is to turn to the page that says, emotion coaching exercises, exercise number one. Everybody have that booklet? There it is. So turn to the page that says emotion coaching exercises, exercise number one. Everybody have it? Okay, you'll need a pen or a pencil for this exercise and here's what I think might be really kind of interesting for you to do with this exercise. There are… There's a list of emotions on that first page. Seven different emotion categories, right. Sadness, anger, fear, affection, pride, just negative emotions in general, and the absence of positive emotions, okay. So what we would like you to do is to choose one of those emotions from that list that you, either you struggle with or you have trouble with it when your child expresses it. Either one. Just pick one of those emotions, okay? And then what we would like you to do is if you turn the pages, you will see that there is a series of questions for each category of emotions. There is a series of questions for each category of emotions that go through pretty much the, almost the end of the book. So once you've picked an emotion that you want to think about then go to the page that has the series of questions about that particular emotion that either you struggle with or when your kid has it, you struggle with your kid having it. And fill out the questions that you see on the page with that emotion at the top. Now note something, the way that you fill these out, the first questions you'll see there is a series of numbers, right, five, four, three, two, one. Okay, so the way that this works is for each of the questions five refers to strongly agree with the statement that's made. Four, means you agree with it but not super strongly. Three, is you could go either way, kind of neutral. You agree with it but not, you know, maybe you disagree with it a little bit. Two is you do disagree with it and then one is you strongly disagree with it. So for each of those statements, circle the number that fits how you feel about that statement. Whether you strongly agree with it, agree, you're kind of neutral about it, you disagree or you strongly disagree with it. Circle the number, okay. Then at the bottom you'll see when I think about this over all, this emotion over all I think my mom was, what? And these are emotion dismissing, emotion disapproving or emotion coaching. And you're gonna put a little check next to those and just for your memory at the beginning of the exercise, the second page of the exercise has the definitions for each of those. For emotion dismissing, emotion disapproving or emotion coaching. So that you can remember what each of those means and then check whether your parents or you was dismissing, disapproving or coaching, okay. And once you are done with that don't worry about the scoring, I think that's the last page. You don't have to worry about the scoring. But when you are done with it either choose a partner or a table to join and share the answers. Share which emotion you picked with the people around you at the table or umm… share also the parenting style that you were raised with, okay. Which emotion you picked and how you answered those questions. Just share that with one another. After you filled it out yourself, okay? Any questions about this? Yes, ma'am. 

01:21:00
UNKNOWN What if your parents don't fit in any of these? 

01:21:00
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN What if your parents don't fit in any of these categories? They are not emotion disapproving, emotion coaching or emotion dismissing so what were they rather than those? 

01:21:20
UNKNOWN I don't know. 

01:21:20
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Were they inter… did they interact with you? Did they like it when you expressed emotion? 

01:21:30
UNKNOWN They were just not there. 

01:21:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN They just weren't there, they were absent, yeah. Okay, if they were absent then it would be emotion dismissing. That's the one you would pick. When your parents were not there, when they were not involved with you, when they were self-involved or whatever just absent from you. Pardon. 

01:21:50
UNKNOWN They were busy with their jobs. 

01:21:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN They were busy with their jobs, right, okay. So they were trying to make a living et cetera. Okay, that would probably be emotion dismissing. They just didn't ask you questions. They didn't really make connection with you, right, around emotions. Would that be true? 

01:22:10
UNKNOWN I shared emotions but we didn't talk about it. 

01:22:15
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN You shared emotions but you didn't talk about it? 

01:22:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:22:20
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Okay. I would, I think that falls in the category of emotion dismissing. And when you, so you can just check that with maybe a little note underneath it that explains it further because these are big broad categories, right. And they are certainly, you know, there is many more details to exactly what was going on there. And feel free if you are comfortable to share that with the folks at your table when you talk about it. Does that sound good? 

01:22:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:22:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Okay. Any other questions? Okay. Let's give it a try and see what happens. Okay, everybody, so let's pause for this one and I just want to explain to you the second exercise. This is something that you will do at home. Umm… you can do, maybe you can do it like for five minutes here if you have a child or maybe even a partner and not a child. But if you have a child, pull out the pink kids love map card deck. I think a bunch of these we could probably do for partners too. 

01:23:40
JOHN GOTTMAN Mostly it's kids. 

01:23:40
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Pardon. 

01:23:40
JOHN GOTTMAN They are mostly kid oriented. 

01:23:45
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN They are mostly kid oriented. They are not necessarily. All right, anyway, okay, so how many of you have a kid? Okay. So if you don't have a kid, umm… you can do what questions apply for partners. Some of them do, some of them don't. But here's what you do, look through the questions in this card deck and divide the deck into two parts. The questions you think you really know the answer to and the questions you don't know the answer to, okay. Umm… Then check on the answers that you think you know when you get home with your kid and/or your partner. And the questions you don't know ask, ask and see what answers you get. You may be surprised at the answers. So go ahead, just take five minutes, look through, divide the deck into half. The questions you think you know the answer to and the questions you don't, okay. So that you can check the answers when you get home with your kids, guess the answers. It could be a game with your kid or with your partner. You guess the answers, see if you guess them right and you could do it either with your child or with your partner and then just ask the questions you don't know the answer to. 

01:25:25

01:25:55
JOHN GOTTMAN See if you can do this where I am.

JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Robert. Go to art museums. Road trips. Solitaire. 

01:27:35
[sil.] 

01:27:50
JOHN GOTTMAN Everything, everything. 

01:27:55
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Yeah. Running. Doctor. I don't know that one. 

01:28:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. Pretty much you know everything about her. 

01:28:15
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Yeah, but we don't know if they're mine. We should play when we get home, okay? 

01:28:25
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. 

01:28:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Right? 

01:28:25
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:28:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Okay, have you divided your deck? Okay, good. All right, so now you know what to do with those cards when you go home. All right, so we just want to open it up now for our last minutes together for any questions you might have about kids, about relationships, about anything in the whole wide world. 

01:28:50
JOHN GOTTMAN Or comments about the exercise, you know. 

01:28:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Sure. If you want to share anything from the exercise, that will be fine too. 

01:28:55
JOHN GOTTMAN If you want to share anything, sure. 

01:28:55
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Yeah. So everybody have a sense of what emotion coaching is now to get a pretty good sense of that, yeah? Do you think you can do it? That's the challenge. Yeah. Question. 

01:29:10
UNKNOWN We have a question about, you know, the marshmallow thing. 

01:29:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:29:15
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN The marshmallow. 

01:29:20
UNKNOWN When we try this thing with my son umm… so what do you call them waiting for 15 minutes. 

01:29:25
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, there is, there is in fact, a series of videos on YouTube on that very topic. How do you build this ability to resist temptation in kids, and you know, and there's lots of information on YouTube about how to do it. For example, it turns out that not looking at it is really helpful, thinking about something else rather than the marshmallow. Thinking about what you want to do when you get home. And so there's a whole bunch of self control strategies that you can teach kids that they can apply not only to the marshmallow situation but across other situations. And these are called self regulation strategies. Emotion regulation strategies. And it is actually possible to learn how to do this self control and then kids who learn this self control, it winds up generalizing across all of life. You know, they learn how to inhibit motor control, how to wait, pause before they act and how to think before they act and choose and so on. So it's turned out to be a very big area of research and people have been very successful in teaching kids how to do this. Because it's probably the most important skill that a kid can learn. There is a wonderful book by Amy Chua called "The Triple Package" and "The Triple Package" is her theory about umm… what immigrant groups into the United States who have been really successful have done, three things about them. And she claims that the first thing is that they feel some sense of superiority. They feel special and superior. Second, they have this ability to delay gratification. And third, they feel insecure. And she goes through the Armenians, the Mormons, the Jews, whole bunch of groups that have come to the United States, Chinese Americans that have been really successful and they all have those three qualities. And if one is missing, they are not successful. So this self control turns out to be really critical, you know. 

01:31:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Any other questions? 

01:31:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Here comes the microphone. 

01:32:00
UNKNOWN I was just wondering… Oh, thank you. Could you just review again the emotion coaching piece with when the child is misbehaving? Yeah, thank you. 

01:32:10
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Right. Okay. So it, in part it depends on age. So if the child is misbehaving, you might want to take the child aside, especially if the child is playing with other kids badly or with siblings or something and ask that child what's going on for them right now, what's going on inside, what are they… You can ask them what they are feeling if they know how to label their feelings. But otherwise like, you know, "What's happening for you? Are you happy? Are you unhappy?" Give them choices about feeling. "Are you sad? Are you angry?" See what they say. Give them choices, what's making you mad? Ask them. They will be able to tell you. And then what you would do is you would empathize with them. "I can see why you'd be mad. You know, Billy just stole your toys so you are really mad at Billy. Is that part of why you hit him? Is that what was going on? Okay, I see, well, I can really… Yeah, it makes sense you would be angry." Then, so you validated emotion, right. Then you set limits. That's that step five. So that step five is setting limits or problem solving so you might want to say, you know, "In this family we don't hit when we are angry. We use our words. We don't hit." So I think it might be a good idea again depending on the age for you to first, you know, "Go back and apologize to Billy for hitting him," and whatever, you know. Let him play with your toy for five minutes and then ask for your toy back. You know, something like that. So you are giving some kind of, you know, non-punishing umm… consequence but you are also problem solving a little bit. So you can also choose that moment too with a little, maybe a little older child is, "What do you think you could say to Billy instead of hitting him? What words could you use instead?" So you're teaching the family value, you are maybe giving a consequence and helping him to problem solve what's a different way of behaving which work better. And if he doesn't have an answer to that then you can help him with an the answer. "What would it be like if you sad, 'I'm really mad could you please give me my toy back?'" You know, something like that. 

01:35:00
JOHN GOTTMAN And if the misbehavior continues, that's a place for a time out. A time out needs to be one minute for one-year-old, two minutes for two-year-old and so on and you really want to give the opportunity. You don't want it to be shaming but you also don't want to send the kid to a room where there is lot of fun things to do. It should be really… A time out is an abbreviation of time out from positive reinforcement. So it has to be really boring like sitting in the corner looking at the wall and then saying, "When you are ready to join us and work on this you can come out of time out." So it's really getting cooperation. 

01:35:45
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Yeah. Any other questions? Yeah. 

01:35:55
UNKNOWN What about when you deal with kids that have PTSD or bipolar or ADHD and there are more than one in a household say like six kids and they are not your provided like multiple program. 

01:36:10
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Okay. So you have six kids who may have PTSD, ADHD, bipolar. Umm… what are the ages? What's the age range of these six kids? 

01:36:20
UNKNOWN Thirteen, eight, six, five, three and one. 

01:36:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Okay. And what's the question? 

01:36:30
UNKNOWN So like how would you approach them on like an even discipline or how they are gonna proceed things like I got the 12-year-old gonna be 13 and you are not treating this five year old the same as me. And so then but I'm trying to be across the board with just time outs or sitting down or… 

01:36:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Have you had these kids on a regular basis? 

01:36:55
UNKNOWN Four of them I have, the 12-year-old they've had her whole life. 

01:37:00
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. 

01:37:00
UNKNOWN But they know they're, you know, they are parents and they know that whole situation and I just try to keep that whole part out of it and we just have our… 

01:37:10
JOHN GOTTMAN So it's more like a school setting, right? Kind of a school or a caretaking? 

01:37:15
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN No, it's her home. 

01:37:15
UNKNOWN No, I'm talking home. This is my house. 

01:37:15
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN It's her house. 

01:37:15
UNKNOWN I take care of my sister's kids. 

01:37:20
JOHN GOTTMAN Oh, okay. 

01:37:20
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN These are her sister's kids. 

01:37:20
JOHN GOTTMAN Oh, okay. All right. So, you know, what you need do in a case like that is really create an environment where they eventually learn about this emotion coaching from you. So you might want to get them all together and say, "You know, I went to this thing yesterday and I heard about this idea of emotion coaching and we are gonna try it in this family. And here is what we are gonna do?" Now, you know, when, when something happens that makes one of you upset. I'm gonna try to really talk to you about it and see when you're feeling, see what's going on with you and I'm gonna try to help you understand your emotions. And well, you know, "We kind of learn how to do it over time together and, you know, kind of be a team figuring out about feelings. Feelings are gonna be very important here and you'll kind of see how this works and I just want you to know that we are trying a new thing and I'm gonna really work on listening when one of you is upset, angry or scared or sad or any emotions I'm gonna try to really be there to be a good listener. I'm gonna need your help in, you know, learning how to do that because every kid is different. And, you know, and I want to make sure that, you know, that what we do, what I do for all of you really feels fair and makes sense for you. So I'm gonna try to, you know, treat you with lot of respect and, you know, I hope you will treat me with respect also. And you'll kind of see how this operates over time, you know." 

01:39:10
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN So… 

01:39:10
JOHN GOTTMAN So you're creating really a new culture that's an emotion coaching culture. 

01:39:15
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Another piece of this is that no, you are not gonna be doing the same discipline across the board because these kids are different. They are different ages, they are at different developmental stages, they have different particular problems that you are trying to support them with and help them with. Umm… and so their needs are very, very different. 

01:39:35
UNKNOWN Last night, Freddy, got problems with this 13-year-old. 

01:39:40
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Okay, so with that 13-year-old, you know, what you can say to the… Oh, I'm sorry, honey. 

01:39:45
JOHN GOTTMAN It's all right. 

01:39:45
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN What you can say to that 13-year-old is something like, "You know, you are a more mature child. You are a more mature person. You've already learned some of the lessons that the little guys haven't learned yet but you are facing very different challenges than what the little guys are facing. Your challenges are really, really tough because right now, you know, what you are trying to do is to fit into your world, to umm… be accepted by your peers, umm… to do pretty well in school because on the horizon here comes high school and high school matters, you know, in terms of getting jobs in the future, in terms of maybe, maybe even going to college. So, you know, you're, you're at a very different point in how your brain is developing and who you are as a person. Right now you're trying on a lot of different things to figure out, who am I? What's important to me, what isn't? And I really want to know about that. I want to be able to understand, what's your world like, what's your social world like? This is a time when kids can be incredibly cruel to each other. And that may be happening to you and I really want to be able to support you with that. So you are facing very different challenges, honey, than, you know, the kids who are five and seven and are just barely learning how to share stuff with one another. It's real different that's why I'm treating you in a different way, et cetera. I'm preparing you to enter the world and you are much closer to entering the world than these little guys." Something like that, does that make sense? Okay. Yeah. Any other questions? 

01:41:50
UNKNOWN Yesterday we had a… 

01:41:55
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Can you wait for the mike for just a moment? Thank you. 

01:42:00
UNKNOWN Yesterday we had a speaker who is a Northwest native man and talked about storytelling. He does this professionally and therapeutically. And umm… in a nutshell what I got out of that is that culturally umm… storytelling is extremely important and that the answer is within the person and that the person telling the story is not going to do this coaching. The story will speak to the individual. Did I say that okay? I don't know. Anyway what I'm wondering is how your message and his message might fit together in this community? 

01:42:40
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Okay, that's, that’s a wonderful question. You know, I think first of all you have to think about the age of the person to whom you are telling stories. So stories can be very illustrative. They are wonderful. You know, they really, they capture our imagination and they convey things that are very, very important. However that doesn't necessarily contrast with naming emotions and talking about emotions. For example, let me give you an example. I used to umm… help my daughter with what I call spirit stories. So when she had to wear that brace that I was telling you about and she would come home very sad and she would feel kind of lonely and as an outsider with other kids when she was like ten, eleven, you know, those years, nine, ten, eleven. I pull her on my lap and I would tell her a story and the story would be about an animal. Usually a deer because she loved deer and it would be how that deer made its way in the world and how that deer felt very, very alone and that deer felt very, very different than other deer but that deer called on its own inner strength and that deer remembered that that deer could leap very high. That deer could run very fast. That deer could climb a mountain even if it took longer that deer could do it, even though its legs were fragile. So that deer had great strength and great power within it even though the other deer didn't like it or were pushing it away. So, you know, you can tell stories that help the child to cope with an emotion that they are having and your… You know, the storytelling person was absolutely right. We all resonate to stories. Stories kind of bypass all the intellectual processing and go right into our hearts, right into our souls. So we can use stories to illustrate ways of coping with different emotion or how people feel when something happens then how they deal with it, what they learn from some particular experience. And those actually fit beautifully together with helping the child to know what that child is feeling, and then what do you do with that feeling? 

01:45:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Let me give you another contrasting point of view which is that emotion coaching is about listening, it's not about talking. It's, you want to really develop the skill with your child or the child you are talking to that really gets that child to be the expert about his or her inner world. They are the storyteller, you are the listener and that there is nothing more powerful I think for a kid than having an adult who really listens and really take that kid seriously because hardly anybody does in a kid's life. You know, most kids, you know, they're sort of brushed aside and most teachers are asking them why questions like, you know, why do they blurred out? Why don't they sit in their seat? Why didn't they finish their homework? And they don't want to know what they think. So if you can really create an atmosphere where they're the storyteller you are the listeners it's very empowering and builds lots of trust with the child. So this really is about listening. 

01:46:45
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Fabulous point. Great point. Any other questions? Yeah, one sec, wait for the mike. 

01:46:55
[sil.] 

01:47:00
UNKNOWN Just a kind of add to that, kind of the way that's, like, I see, you know, building the emotional stuff. A lot of stories that he was talking kind of were open ended to be interpreted by the child or the person that they are told to they weren't necessarily giving all the answers in the story. So I could see how the emotional coaching could really benefit them in being able to interpret the stories better to themselves possibly even, because of the opening. That's how I saw that they could really fit together well. 

01:47:35
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Cool. Wonderful. That sounds great. Just great. Good. Any other questions? 

01:47:45
UNKNOWN I have a question. Have you ever done anything wrong with your daughter that you wish you would have done differently? 

01:47:55
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN A thousand things. 

01:47:55
JOHN GOTTMAN And you should do things wrong. 

01:48:00
UNKNOWN And whether you've learned from that then? 

01:48:00
JOHN GOTTMAN If you can apologize to your kid, it, you know, it does an amazing thing for your child. If you can come and say, you know, "I really blew at this morning. I just, you know, I lost it, I got really mad and called you a name and I, you know, I did everything wrong and I really want to apologize and, you know, I blew it." And that gives a child an enormous amount, that's a real gift because it says, "Gee my dad can say, I'm sorry and could screw up and it's all right, you know. And he is asking for my apology? Wow, you know. I must be pretty important and I guess I can screw up occasionally too and fix it, you know, and apologize." So I think it's important to make mistakes as a parent. Go home and make mistakes and screw up and then apologize. It's just a great thing to do with a kid. You will anyway, you know. I mean, none of us is by any means perfect. They raise us, right? We don't raise them, they raise us. 

01:49:05
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Great. Great. 

01:49:05
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:49:05
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Good answer. Okay. Okay. One more question. 

01:49:15
UNKNOWN Everybody think that I am naturally loud. 

01:49:15
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Okay. 

01:49:15
UNKNOWN I think that maybe just I… I can assume that we're also addressing step parenting… 

01:49:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Sure. 

01:49:30
UNKNOWN Split parenting or… 

01:49:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN All of the above. 

01:49:30
UNKNOWN I'm wondering if maybe you had some helpful tip that when you have license probably to keep up the work with the kid, which is the most beneficial that I'm wondering if you have some tips to support parenting in this home this way, parenting in this home this way, parenting in this home this way. 

01:49:50
JOHN GOTTMAN Let me, let me answer that just real quickly is that we studied that in our research and it only takes one emotion coach to help a kid to deal with all of rectitudes of divorce and all that stuff. One person listening to that child is a good listener. A step parent can be a great emotion coach because, you know, you don't have to be responsible for discipline, you know. You can… An important thing is that you keep a channel of communication open and if you can genuinely listen to a kid, you know, respectfully with compassion and you are, you are really there then it's an enormous gift to that child and they will trust you over time. And they will become your ally over time. And this, this was even true in a school for emotionally disturbed kids I worked with that all kinds of problems. After emotion coaching for a little while, you know, five or six time for the kid it's like the two of you are trying to figure this out together. You are like a team working on this problem together and they're, you know, they develop the skills for labeling their emotion, figuring stuff out. And it becomes easier and it becomes very gratifying to do over time. 

01:51:10
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN The other thing too is that I worked with a lot of parents who are divorced and whose parenting styles are totally inconsistent and the thing that you can do is trust your kid, trust your kid. Your gut, you know, you do the best parenting you can. The other parent may do something totally different that drives your kid crazy, right. And so your kid is faced with this inconsistency and, you know, what's right and what isn't and, you know, I can do, I can get away with all this here and I can't there et cetera. So trust the kid because kids, they may not say it but instinctively they can feel what feels better. And sometimes for example limit setting feels better for kids than just as I failure, you know, totally permissive parenting because the limit setting keeps the kid safe, keeps the kid safe, helps the kid learn things they need to learn to survive in the world, right. So the kid may fight against that at first but the kid over time will realize it. So trust the kid's own institution. They'll, they'll know what's right. 

01:52:35
JOHN GOTTMAN How many of you remember, can remember what it was like to be a child? Can you remember? Can you put yourself back into what it's like to be a kid? Because I can do that more easily and I know… 

01:52:45
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Do we have to? 

01:52:50
JOHN GOTTMAN I know a lot of, you know, child psychologists who can't remember what it's like to be a kid and, you know, it really sucks in a lot of ways to be a kid because nobody is really taking you seriously, nobody is paying any attention to you or, you know, wanting to find out what your thoughts are. And so, you know, you probably can think back when you were a kid, you know, was there anybody who really listened to you when you were little, you know? How many of you had somebody who really listened to you? Okay, one person. Two people, three people, okay, four people. So what was that like when you had that person who really listened to you? What was it like for you? 

01:53:30
UNKNOWN Umm… you know, my parents weren't particularly good it a lot of ways but one thing they did do is they always thought that what I had to say was really important. 

01:53:40
JOHN GOTTMAN They did? 

01:53:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. And so I don't know because I don't know that I have the experience of not knowing. 

01:53:50
JOHN GOTTMAN Oh, it's great. It's great. You know, that's so unusual. Anybody else who had somebody in their childhood who was a good listener? What was that like for you? 

01:54:05
UNKNOWN Umm… it, it was safe. I, I knew that I could share something and that it would be well received. I wasn't scared to go to my parents with something. And so… 

01:54:15
JOHN GOTTMAN A secure base, you know. 

01:54:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. It just felt like if, my emotions were okay, what I had to say was gonna be okay, and it really was safe. 

01:54:25
JOHN GOTTMAN Great. 

01:54:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ-GOTTMAN Cool. It's late. 

01:54:30
JOHN GOTTMAN Anybody else had somebody who listened to them? What it was like for you? 

01:54:35
MARIE Umm… for me it was my grandma. 

01:54:40
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. 

01:54:40
MARIE And still is today. 

01:54:40
JOHN GOTTMAN Still as today, okay. Wow. 

01:54:40
MARIE My best friend and my hero. 

01:54:45
JOHN GOTTMAN She is special to you. 

01:54:45
MARIE Yeah. 

01:54:45
JOHN GOTTMAN And what did it feel like as a kid can you remember what that felt like as a child? 

01:54:50
MARIE Oh, my God, I mean, she, she'll even remember things I said as a little girl and repeat them today. And sorry. And my parents separated when I was about seven and I have always gone to grandma's house over every weekend and stuff. But she would just always validate how I felt and she was even sharing this the other day. She was like, Marie, you were just crying and you are like, "How would you feel if your parents were getting divorced?" 

01:55:20
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:55:20
UNKNOWN And just really empathizing… 

01:55:20
JOHN GOTTMAN Right. 

01:55:25
MARIE How I felt and validating that and I just… I think her every day that you really put that self-esteem in me that how I… My feelings were absolutely validated and right on and… 

01:55:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Very powerful. 

01:55:40
MARIE Very powerful and just to recognize that made you how.. What my views are in my family or of the world at that time, even as a little girl was right on. You know, where so many adults are, oh, you are just a little kid, you don't know what you are talking about. 

01:55:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Right. 

01:55:55
MARIE You know, and I was pretty lucky to be given a counselor as young as ten. And the lot of these questions that you have in your cards remind me of my… Of just conversations I had with my counselor just validating how I was feeling and exploring not more and what is that like. So it's kind of cool that you are teaching parents how to be kind of counselors in a way for their kids. 

01:56:20
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. 

01:56:20
MARIE Thank you. 

01:56:20
JOHN GOTTMAN What about for you? You had your hand up. 

01:56:25
UNKNOWN Oh, mine was my grandfather on my mom's side because my father was part of the boarding schools in South Dakota and he was really detached from me. 

01:56:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah.
