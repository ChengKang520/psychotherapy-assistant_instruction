Key Strategies for Multitheoretical Counseling and Psychotherapy Volume V: Multicultural Strategies for Counseling and Psychotherapy with Jeff E. Brooks-Harris, Ph.D., ABPP and Dr. Winter C. Hamada, Ph.D. 

00:00:00
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  Hello, I'm Dr. Jeff Brooks-Harris and this is my colleague, Dr. Winter Hamada. We will be demonstrating 14 multicultural skills that can be used when culture is an important focus in counseling or psychotherapy. 

00:00:35
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA  It may be most helpful to focus on cultural issues in counseling when clients are adjusting to a new cultural setting or when cultural world view is closely related to presenting concerns. 

00:00:50
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Multicultural skills are also useful when clients are experiencing prejudice or oppression, or if there are cultural differences between the client and counselor. 

00:01:00
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA These multicultural strategies can be used in combination with skills drawn from other approaches that focused on other dimensions. 

00:01:10
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS The skills we will be demonstrating are also described in Chapter 10 of this book, Integrative Multitheoretical Psychotherapy. 

00:01:15
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA You can find more information about this book in other videos in this series on the web at www.multitheoretical.com. 

00:01:25
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS I will be demonstrating the odd numbered strategies with a client named Puah, who is a native Hawaiian and Filipina-American female. Puah is experiencing anxiety and is afraid she won't succeed in graduate school. Puah is being portrayed by a graduate student named Andrea Nacapoy. 

00:01:45
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA I will be demonstrating the even numbered to skills with a client named Maria, who is a Cuban-American female. Maria is married to a soldier who has been deployed to the war for several months. She came to counseling to deal with depression. Maria is being portrayed by a graduate student named Iruma Bello. 

00:02:05
Multicultural Strategy 1 Viewing Clients Culturally Observing and understanding clients' thoughts, actions, and feelings from a cultural point of view 

00:02:05
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  I'll be demonstrating the first strategy, viewing clients culturally. This skill highlights the way culture shapes human functioning. So Puah, how did you do on your exam? 

00:02:35
PUAH I did terribly uhm, I don't think I'm smart enough. 

00:02:40
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS So you didn't do well in the exam and you don't think you're smart enough? 

00:02:45
PUAH No. Ah, I think I'm gonna dropout. 

00:02:45
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS You think you're gonna, you're thinking about dropping out of graduate school? 

00:02:50
PUAH Yeah, I mean, I, I don't think I can cut it. 

00:02:55
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. Well, I understand why you're worried after your first exam not doing well. Uhm, I know you've been struggling since you moved here. In addition to the academics being more difficult, I'm wondering if there's anything else that's contributing to your, to your struggles. 

00:03:10
PUAH  I don't know. I'm just not smart enough. 

00:03:15
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Well, that's one possibility. There is the possibility that you're not smart enough and that you may not be, be as intelligent as some of your other classmates. I'd like to look at some of the other things that are going in your, on in your life that may be a challenge right now. 

00:03:30
PUAH I don't know. 

00:03:30
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  Well, you, you moved from Hawaii to Illinois, and you're faced with a real different situation. How do you think that might be influencing your experience in graduate school? 

00:03:45
PUAH Well, it's the first time I ever left home and been away from my family. So.(crosstalk) 

00:03:50
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. So how, what's it been like being away from your family? 

00:03:55
PUAH Well, it's really hard 'coz you know, ah, there's a big time difference. We can't talk as much as we used to. And I don't really get ah, along with people here. I mean they're different. 

00:04:05
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. So you're a long away from home, you're missin' your family and you feel different than, than the people around you. 

00:04:10
PUAH  Well, in my program a, there's a few other we, women, but I'm the only person of color. 

00:04:20
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. So, so, most, it's predominantly male with the few females, and predominantly white. 

00:04:25
PUAH  Yes. 

00:04:30
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS And you're the only woman of color. 

00:04:30
PUAH Yes. 

00:04:30
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS So, what how do you think these two factors, the fact that you're long away from home and that you're feeling out of place in this cultural environment, how do you think those factors might be influencing your academic success? 

00:04:45
PUAH Well, I definitely don't have the, this people to talk to... (crosstalk) 

00:04:50
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. 

00:04:50
PUAH ...about stuff. I'm doing a lot of things on my own and I'm not used to that. I mean I have a really big family and lots of friends back in Hawaii. 

00:04:55
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  Okay. So, do you think it would be helpful for us to look at how these, these changes in your life are moving from one cultural setting to another and being, feeling a little bit out of place in your department, do you think it would be helpful to look at those? And see if those might be impacting your academic success? 

00:05:20
PUAH Uh hmm. 

00:05:20
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS So I'm willing to, I'm willing to entertain the possibility that you're not smart enough. But I want, I wanna see if these other factors may be contributing, too. And if we help you find better ways of adjusting to the cultural setting, those, those adjustments might help you do well academically and live up to your potential. 

00:05:40
PUAH Okay. 

00:05:40
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. So, I think we'll need to look at, at all of these things together. 

00:05:45
PUAH Okay. 

00:05:45
Multicultural Strategy 2 Clarifying the Impact of Culture Clarifying the impact of cultural contexts on current functioning, interpersonal relationships, and social system 

00:05:45
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA  The first strategy I'll demonstrate is clarifying the impact of culture. This skill is useful when clients are unaware of culture's influence on their lives. So, Maria, you mentioned before, that the depression really only started when you moved from Florida to Hawaii. Is that right? 

00:06:25
MARIA Yeah. 

00:06:25
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA You know, it's actually very common for people who are transitioning from one culture to a new or different culture, to experience some difficulties adjusting. 

00:06:35
MARIA Okay. 

00:06:35
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA So, I wonder if it might be a good idea for us to explore in more depth just how that transition is impacting your mood. 

00:06:45
MARIA Okay. We can do that. 

00:06:45
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Good. So, for example, uhm, one of the ways that it might be impacting you is by changing the way you're thinking. So, can you think of a way that, since you moved to Hawaii, your thoughts have been impacted? 

00:07:00
MARIA I think, ever since I've moved here, I've become more negative. 

00:07:05
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA  Hhmm. 

00:07:10
MARIA Uhm, and that's the best way I can describe it. I'm not sure that's what you're looking for. 

00:07:15
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:07:15
MARIA But, when I was back home, I guess I would see everything in a positive light. Everything... (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:07:20
MARIA Had a silver lining. 

00:07:20
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:07:20
MARIA  And here, even though everyone tells me, especially my friends and family back home, "Oh, you're in Hawaii. It's wonderful. You're living in paradise. You must be so happy." I don't feel happy and everything just seems like bad and it just sucks. 

00:07:40
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. You know, that actually makes a lot of sense. It, it's hard moving from one culture to a totally different cultural environment so it makes sense that the negative thoughts would start coming up for you. And that's a real change from what it sounds like you were like before. 

00:07:55
MARIA Yeah. 

00:07:55
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA How do you think it's impacting your actions or your behavior? 

00:08:00
MARIA  Well, I guess, I don't go out with people too much here. Back... (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:08:10
MARIA ...home, I would always be busy. I would always be doing things. 

00:08:15
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:08:15
MARIA I would enjoy spending time with my friends. I would enjoy, you know, spending time with my family. I was involved in community activities. 

00:08:20
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:08:20
MARIA I'd had all these things going on. And now, it's, like, I just wanna stay home. 

00:08:25
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA  Uh hmm. 

00:08:30
MARIA I don't wanna meet anybody. When I do meet people, I'm not enthusiastic about it or looking forward to it. 

00:08:35
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA So it sounds like you used to be very outgoing and extroverted uhm, but since you've been in Hawaii, that's changed. And you've become a little bit more socially isolated. 

00:08:45
MARIA Yeah. I would say that's... (crosstalk) 

00:08:45
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Hhmm. 

00:08:45
MARIA ...true. 

00:08:45
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA  And then, how would you describe your emotional experience since moving to Hawaii? 

00:08:55
MARIA I'm just sad all the time. I mean, I feel like crying all the time. 

00:09:00
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:09:00
MARIA I feel lonely. My husband isn't here. 

00:09:00
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA  That's right. 

00:09:05
MARIA My family isn't here. My close friends aren't here. So, I just feel, like, really sad. That's... (crosstalk) 

00:09:10
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:09:10
MARIA ...the best way to sum it up. 

00:09:10
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:09:10
MARIA  And then, other than that, I also feel drained. 

00:09:15
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Oh. 

00:09:15
MARIA Considering, I'm not working. I'm not really doing that much. I never really have a lot of energy. 

00:09:20
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:09:20
MARIA To go out, to do anything. 

00:09:20
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA  Right. So, the symptoms you're describing now are very consistent with depression. And so, actually, it sounds like uhm, moving from one culture to a new culture has really impacted you in a lot of ways. It's impacted the way that you think. It's impacted your actions and it's impacted your feelings and probably also, your relationships. So, I think it will be important for us to continue looking at the impact of culture on your mood as well as on how you're coping with the transition. 

00:09:55
MARIA Okay. We can do that. 

00:09:55
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Okay. 

00:09:55
Multicultural Strategy 3 Creating Culturally-Appropriate Relationships Creating therapeutic relationships that appropriately match clients' cultural expectations 

00:09:55
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  The next multicultural skill involves creating culturally, appropriate relationships. Enacting a therapeutic relationship that matches clients' expectations is a foundational skill that is particularly useful at the beginning of counseling. Puah, I have a question for you that might help us decide how to proceed. 

00:10:35
PUAH Okay. 

00:10:35
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS I'm wondering if you have any ideas about what kind of relationship you want us to have or what kind of role you want me to take on as we look at your experience in graduate school. 

00:10:45
PUAH Like what? 

00:10:45
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  Well, some, some people wanna have a pretty formal relationship with their counselor uhm, where I'm more like a doctor. Other people want uhm, a less formal where I may be in a more consulting role. Do you have ah, an idea for you what role I can play that would be most helpful for you? 

00:11:05
PUAH Well, I don't know about that but I know what I don't want you to be. 

00:11:10
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. That's a good place to start. What don't you want me to be? 

00:11:15
PUAH Well, I don't want you to be my cheerleader and just tell me stuff that you think will make me feel good but is unrealistic. 

00:11:20
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. So if I'm a cheerleader, it's j ust the "Go team! You're the best! You're doing great! You can make it!" 

00:11:25
PUAH Well, yeah. I mean, if you think I'm not smart enough and I'm gonna fail all my classes, I'd rather you tell me... (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS That. 

00:11:35
PUAH ...than let me go through that humiliation. 

00:11:35
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. So, you want me to be honest with you and let you know if I think you don't have what it takes to cut it in graduate school? 

00:11:40
PUAH  Yeah. 

00:11:45
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. 

00:11:45
PUAH Hhmm. If you can do that, you'll probably be the only person who would do that for me. 

00:11:50
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. Because the other people in your life are gonna be cheerleaders. 

00:11:55
PUAH Well, my family and friends, I mean, my family especially, they put a lot of money into sending me out here. And they're very confident in my abilities and they're gonna support me no matter what. 

00:12:05
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Uh hmm. 

00:12:05
PUAH I decide to do. 

00:12:05
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  So, you need me to play another role, a different role? 

00:12:10
PUAH Yeah. I want you to be honest with me. (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  Okay. I'll, I, I think I can do that. I've worked with a lot of university students and I, so I think I can be helpful to you in being honest and helping you decide whether graduate school is the right place for you to be right now. Or, or help, maybe help you decide that it's not the right place to be. 

00:12:30
PUAH Hmm. 

00:12:30
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  What if I take on that honest, direct, evaluative role. What would that mean for you within your background, within your cultural context? 

00:12:45
PUAH Uhm, I don't know. I, I guess, I'd appreciate it. 

00:12:50
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. You said that your family members would be the ones that would be going, "You can do it! We, we, we believe in you 100 percent." In your, when you think about, uhm, back at home, what, what kind of person would be, give you that honest, direct feedback? 

00:13:10
PUAH Ah, I guess, my friends, if I ask for it. 

00:13:15
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. 

00:13:15
PUAH Or just my old professors, maybe. 

00:13:20
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. So you had some professors back home that you feel like could give you the honest feedback about? 

00:13:25
PUAH Well, yeah. I mean, that's how I decided to pursue a graduate career in engineering. 

00:13:30
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay, okay. So there were people who said you do have what it takes. But right now, you need me to play that role to, to help you decide if it, if that's still true and if they were right? 

00:13:40
PUAH  Yeah, I mean, I'm not doing well. 

00:13:45
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. So you're worried that, that, that you don't have enough and you needed someone to help you evaluate that in a real, balanced way? 

00:13:50
PUAH Yes. 

00:13:50
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. Well, I'll try and do my best, ah, to help you make the right decision. 

00:13:55
PUAH Okay. 

00:13:55
Multicultural Strategy 4 Celebrating diversity in order to help clients accept and express their uniqueness 

00:13:55
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA  The next multicultural strategy is celebrating diversity. When clients feel inhibited about identity, it may be helpful to celebrate their diversity. So, Maria, you mentioned before how being Hispanic makes you feel different in Hawaii, right? 

00:14:35
MARIA Yeah. 

00:14:35
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA  So, I wonder, what are some things that you actually value about being Hispanic? 

00:14:45
MARIA Hmm. I never really thought about that. I don't know. What do you mean? 

00:14:50
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Well, what are some things that you enjoyed about being Hispanic when you're back home in Florida that you haven't really been able to enjoy since moving to Hawaii? 

00:14:55
MARIA  Hmm, well, I think one of the things is that in general, Cuban culture is, we're very talkative, we're outgoing, we all get together. 

00:15:10
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:15:10
MARIA We sh, share whatever we're thinking, we are very open... (crosstalk) 

00:15:15
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:15:15
MARIA ...about our thoughts and just the way that we are. 

00:15:20
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:15:20
MARIA And here, I don't know if it's because I live on the base, everybody just seems more reserved and more, almost cold. 

00:15:30
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Hmm. 

00:15:30
MARIA And when I, I'm opinionated and when I do say whatever I think, I feel out of place like I'm talking too much or I'm saying. 

00:15:35
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uhm. 

00:15:35
MARIA  I don't know, something inappropriate. 

00:15:40
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA So, so one of the things that you really appreciate about your Cuban background is the ability to speak freely. 

00:15:45
MARIA Yeah. 

00:15:45
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Yeah. Okay. What else? 

00:15:50
MARIA Dancing. I mean, I go out with my friends. When I was in Miami, we used to go salsa dancing in clubs all the time and it's like a fun thing to do, not only to go to the club and dance but even before. You get together, you dress up, you, it's like a whole event and it's fun. 

00:16:10
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
MARIA  And here I feel that, at least the people I know, they don't dress up. They, everyone is really laid back. 

00:16:20
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:16:20
MARIA And they like to go and have barbecues, which is not really my thing. 

00:16:25
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Hmm. 

00:16:25
MARIA Uhm, nobody really goes dancing or salsa or even less. 

00:16:30
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:16:30
MARIA So that's one thing I miss. 

00:16:30
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA You know, even as you're talking about going dancing and getting dressed up, it's almost like you kinda... (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
MARIA Yeah. 

00:16:35
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA ...light up, yeah(laughing). 

00:16:35
MARIA  I missed it. 

00:16:40
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Yeah. Is there anything else that you really miss? 

00:16:40
MARIA I guess the other thing would be the food. There's not a lot of Cuban food here. 

00:16:45
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Right. 

00:16:45
MARIA I mean, there's some Hispanic food but Cuban food is different. Not all Hispanic countries have the same food. 

00:16:50
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Hmm. 

00:16:50
MARIA  And I don't really cook. 

00:16:55
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Hmm. 

00:16:55
MARIA So when I was home, it was easy to get food that I like... (crosstalk) 

00:17:00
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:17:00
MARIA ...like comfort food, that made me... (crosstalk) 

00:17:00
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Oh, right. 

00:17:00
MARIA ...feel better. And here, I have to adjust to a lot of different types of food, a lot of different cultural. 

00:17:05
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA  Uh hmm. 

00:17:10
MARIA Like food that I wasn't used to, that I have never been exposed to. 

00:17:10
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Right. 

00:17:10
MARIA So even going out to eat sometimes becomes a big hassle 'coz I don't know if I'm gonna like it or if I'm not gonna like it. And there isn't one place where I love it and it's like back home. 

00:17:20
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:17:20
MARIA  So I miss that part. 

00:17:25
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA And there's probably not too many places to buy Cuban... (crosstalk) 

00:17:25
MARIA No. Uh hmm. 

00:17:30
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA ...ingredients even if you wanted to cook, right? 

00:17:30
MARIA No, there aren't. 

00:17:30
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Right. So it sounds like there is a lot of things you appreciate about your Cuban culture that you haven't really been able to enjoy since moving to Hawaii. 

00:17:40
MARIA Yeah. 

00:17:40
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Yeah. 

00:17:40
MARIA Yeah. 

00:17:40
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Hmm. I wonder if there are ways that we could begin to look at how build some of these things into your life... (crosstalk) 

00:17:50
MARIA Uh hmm. 

00:17:50
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA ...even now that you're in Hawaii so that you could feel more comfortable. 

00:17:55
MARIA I don't know how but well, we can try. (crosstalk) 

00:18:00
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA You might find them. 

00:18:00
MARIA Okay. 

00:18:00
Multicultural Strategy 5 Illuminating similarities and differences between psychotherapist and client, and acknowledging the impact of power on the therapeutic relationship 

00:18:00
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  The next skill is illuminating similarities and differences. It may be helpful to acknowledge and explore differences that may result in misunderstandings or similarities that may encourage overidentification. I'm wondering, Puah, we've been talking about what it's like for you to be studying in a predominantly white male department. I'm curious what it's like for you to be talking about these things and working with me uhm, as a white male. 

00:18:50
PUAH It's not a problem. 

00:18:50
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  Okay. I'm glad that you don't think that's a problem, uhm. I guess I'm, I guess I'm concerned that some of your, the ways that you tend to relate to these white male professors that you've said that you wanna kinda defer to their authority and that kind of thing. I'm wondering if some of those things might come out in, in our relationship in counseling. 

00:19:15
PUAH Well, I intend to do what you tell me to do. 

00:19:20
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. Uhm, and, and, so that may, hopefully I'm giving you good advice but I'm also wondering if it might be, if there might be a way for us to use the differences between us in a different way here in counseling. 

00:19:35
PUAH  Like what? 

00:19:40
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS So you've said that your, it's hard for you to disagree with your professors or to take a different opinion. What would it be like to practice standing up for yourself in a different way with me? 

00:19:55
PUAH I think it'd be uncomfortable. 

00:19:55
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. Do you think that it might be helpful to try and practice some of that with me? 

00:20:00
PUAH  Okay. 

00:20:05
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. So let's try a little bit of an experiment. I'm gonna give you some bad advice and you, you need to try and disagree with me, and we'll see how that goes. 

00:20:15
PUAH Okay. 

00:20:15
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. I noticed you're wearing kinda light colors, that white shirt and a, and a beige sweater. Light colors aren't really good for you. I think you should wear bright, really bright colors and that'll help you stand out. 

00:20:25
PUAH  Okay, uhm, but I like white. 

00:20:35
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS So, so you like white. 

00:20:35
PUAH (laughs) Yeah. 

00:20:40
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS And you think you look good in white? 

00:20:40
PUAH I think I look fine in white. 

00:20:40
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS So what are you gonna do about my suggestion that you wear bright colors? 

00:20:45
PUAH I'm not gonna listen to you (laughs). 

00:20:45
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  Okay. So, what was that like for you to disagree with me? 

00:20:55
PUAH Uhm, well it's definitely uncomfortable... (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. 

00:20:55
PUAH  In the beginning. 

00:21:00
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS What made it uncomfortable? 

00:21:00
PUAH Ah, you put me on the spot and I didn't know how to respond. 

00:21:05
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay, okay. And obviously, this is just an experiment and hopefully, your professors aren't gonna tell you what to wear. But there may be similar situations where you have that same feeling of this isn't right for me. That's kind of how I read the look on your face, "This isn't right for me, he's wrong." And we might be able to help you realize when, when you wanna go a different way than some of the people in your life. 

00:21:30
PUAH  Okay. 

00:21:35
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS And maybe, so, I'm wondering if we can use this as a place to practice some of that where you can practice dealing with authority figures in a different way. 

00:21:45
PUAH And that would be helpful... (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Yeah. 

00:21:45
PUAH ...'coz that was very uncomfortable. 

00:21:50
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. So, I think we'll need a little more practice, but it may be easier to practice it in here before you try standing up for yourself with some of your professors. 

00:21:55
PUAH  Okay. 

00:22:00
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. I'm glad you're willing to try that. 

00:22:00
PUAH Thank you. 

00:22:00
Multicultural Strategy Assessing identity development and recognizing its impact on how clients value different world views and make attributions of personal success and failure 

00:22:00
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA  The next skill is recognizing the impact of identity. This strategy is useful when clients don't realize how cultural identity impacts their perceptions of success or failure. So, you mentioned before how you haven't been able to really enjoy doing things here in Hawaii that you used to enjoy doing back home, right? 

00:22:45
MARIA Yeah. 

00:22:45
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Have you tried being yourself here in Hawaii? 

00:22:45
MARIA  Well, when I first came, I tried to make friends and... (crosstalk) 

00:22:50
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:22:50
MARIA ...meet people. It isn't turn out so well. 

00:22:55
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
MARIA It just didn't work. I don't know. 

00:22:55
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA  So, tell me more about what went wrong for you. 

00:23:00
MARIA  I think that I always saw myself as a very assertive person. 

00:23:10
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
MARIA A very outgoing person, I knew how I was I, like my personality was set and never really wavered. 

00:23:15
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:23:15
MARIA And I would meet people and I would be talkative and outgoing and just friendly, and yet when I do that here it almost feels out of place, like I talk too much or I say things that are too forward or... (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh-hmm. 

00:23:30
MARIA  It makes me feel awkward to sta, state my opinion. And what ends up happening is that I'm just not, like I'm not sure how to act. 

00:23:40
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh-hmm. 

00:23:40
MARIA Well, I don't know. 

00:23:45
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA So, one of the ways that's impacted you to, to move to Hawaii is you're starting to question that part of yourself the, the assertive, outspoken part? 

00:23:55
MARIA Yeah. It makes me wonder... (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Hmm. 

00:23:55
MARIA ...if it's something that I need to change about myself. It makes me wonder if it's something that's inappropriate. 

00:24:00
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
MARIA You know. Just because I was like that before, it doesn't mean that's the right way of doing. Maybe there is something wrong with me. Maybe I need to be different and be more reserved and not just say what I think and express myself. Maybe I need to be a little bit more. 

00:24:20
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
MARIA Toned-down. 

00:24:20
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA So, since you've been realizing how uncomfortable that feels, how has that changed your, your interactions with people? 

00:24:30
MARIA  Well, I end up being confused, so then... (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh-huh. 

00:24:35
MARIA ...I'm not being myself. Then, when I see some part of myself coming out that's more outgoing or more opinionated, then I try to hold back and, it's a sense of being really frustrating and I just avoid it. 

00:24:50
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA So... (crosstalk) 

00:24:50
MARIA I avoid seeing people. (crosstalk) 

00:24:50
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Okay. 

00:24:50
MARIA I avoid hanging out with them. I, just 'coz I'm not sure how I should be acting and it makes me feel uncomfortable. 

00:24:55
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA So, it's easier to just avoid even interacting with people than it is. (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
MARIA Yeah. 

00:25:00
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA ...to try and change the way you normally would interact with people. 

00:25:05
MARIA I'm just not sure how to change it. I'm not sure what would be, if I had a script that I could follow. 

00:25:10
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:25:10
MARIA That would tell me, "Yeah. Act like this." You know, if I didn't like it, maybe I would try it, but I'm not just, not even sure. I end up being confused... (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh-hmm. 

00:25:20
MARIA ...I don't know. 

00:25:20
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA So, as you're encountering a new culture, a new environment altogether, it sounds like you're beginning to question who you are, who, what your identity is now... (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
MARIA Yeah. 

00:25:35
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Right? And, and people are responding to you, it sounds like differently here than they would have back in Florida too, which contributes to some of the confusion that you're describing. 

00:25:45
MARIA Yeah. I would say that, yeah. 

00:25:50
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. And that makes sense. It makes sense that you would be questioning who you are, uhm, and so, we should talk more about how your identity is being impacted by this move. 

00:26:00
MARIA  Okay. 

00:26:05
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA Okay. 

00:26:05
Multicultural Strategy 7 Facilitating the awareness and development of cultural identity in order to promote self-acceptance and empowerment 

00:26:05
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  Another multi-cultural strategy involves facilitating identity development. If clients do not know who they are in the context of their own culture, it may be helpful to promote awareness. 

00:26:35
PUAH Sometimes my, I think my professors and classmates think I'm stupid. 

00:26:40
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Why do you think that? 

00:26:40
PUAH Well, they have different expectations about learning than I do. 

00:26:45
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. What are their expectations? 

00:26:45
PUAH  Well, they like people who are outspoken and w ho speak up in class when the professors try to facilitate a discussion. 

00:27:00
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. And that's true, a lot of professors like the students that answer the questions and keep things going. 

00:27:05
PUAH Uh hmm. 

00:27:05
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS What are your expectations about learning? 

00:27:05
PUAH  Well, back home, if you speak a lot or you answer all the questions, you, kind of, come across as an arrogant or conceited. 

00:27:20
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. So, in your culture, growing up in Hawaii, people who answer all the questions look arrogant or cocky? 

00:27:30
PUAH Well, yeah. I mean, sometimes if you're just talking to talk... (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Uh hmm. 

00:27:35
PUAH ...and you don't really have anything important to say. 

00:27:35
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. And that uhm, and how do you think these two different cultural rules, sets of rules is impacting your experience as a graduate student? 

00:27:45
PUAH Well, I definitely don't talk as much as my classmates do... (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Uh hmm. 

00:27:50
PUAH ...and I tend to take a longer time to answer questions, so, by the time I'm ready to say something, they've already said what I wanted to say or... (crosstalk) 

00:28:00
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. 

00:28:00
PUAH ...they started the discussion in a different direction. 

00:28:05
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS And that's some of the things that are, are making you worried, that people think you're not as smart as your classmates. 

00:28:10
PUAH Well, yeah. I mean, I hardly ever talk so, maybe the professors think I don't read the assignments or I don't know what's going on. 

00:28:20
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. So, in some ways, you're encountering a new culture that has different rules than the culture that you grew up in and because of that uhm, you're, the way you express yourself, you're worried, isn't gonna communicate how bright and intelligent you are. Well, I'm wondering how you wanna deal with this, the, the, the difference between these two cultures. Uhm, do you wanna learn how to be more outspoken or do you want to help the people in your department understand that you're working with a different set of values? 

00:28:55
PUAH I guess a little bit of both but I wouldn't know how to go about telling them about my culture. 

00:29:00
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  Okay. So, so you're, you know that you're being quiet out of respect and, and humility and you're trying to formulate just the right answer rather than jumping in too quickly, but you're worried that they're gonna misinterpret that. 

00:29:15
PUAH  Uh-huh. 

00:29:20
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS I'm wondering if there's, what would it be like for you to talk to one of your professors and tell them about why you're not as verbal in your classes as some of your classmates might? 

00:29:30
PUAH  Uhm, I think that would be hard for me... (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Yeah. 

00:29:35
PUAH ...to do, yeah. 

00:29:35
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS And I think it would be ah, a little bit challenging at first. It's my experience that most professors wanna understand their students and want to be good teachers. Uhm, if you were gonna try something like that where you're gonna try and talk about how they communicate your, your situation and your values within the department, is there, is there any pro, professor that might be a little easier to talk to than some of the others? 

00:30:00
PUAH  Well, I guess there's this woman professor that I get along pretty well with. 

00:30:10
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. What would it be like to talk to her about kind of your experience in the department and how hard it is for you to speak up in the class maybe get some support from her. 

00:30:20
PUAH Well, I think it'll be difficult but I, I guess I can try. 

00:30:25
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Is that something you wanna try or, or should we look at some other options? 

00:30:30
PUAH Well, I think its important and maybe starting off with someone that I feel comfortable with initially, might be a good place to start. 

00:30:35
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. Yeah. I think that that, that might be a, a good first step, is to hel, in, in terms of helping them understand your situation and, and try and begin to figure out how to make some changes. 

00:30:50
PUAH And maybe seeing if they do think I'm stupid... (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS What. 

00:30:55
PUAH ...or if. 

00:30:55
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS She might be someone that you'd feel al, safe enough saying, "Does it seem like I'm not as intelligent as the other students?" 

00:31:00
PUAH Hmm. 

00:31:00
DR. JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  Okay. Well, good luck with that. I know that it will be a little bit of a stretch. 

00:31:05
PUAH Oh, yeah. I'll try. 

00:31:05
Multicultural Strategy 8 Appreciating the intersection of multiple identities including race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, class, ability, and age. 

00:31:05
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA  The next demonstration involves appreciating multiple identities. Understanding the intersection of different cultural identities helps clients view themselves in a more holistic manner. So, besides moving to a very small Cuban community here in Hawaii, you've, you're also new to the US military culture, right? 

00:31:50
MARIA Yeah. 

00:31:50
DR. WINTER C. HAMADA How has that been for you? 

00:31:50
MARIA Well, I think that just, it adds on to everything else. 

00:31:55
WINTER C. HAMADA Hmm. 

00:31:55
MARIA I don't know how familiar you are with Cuban history but in general, people from Cuba leave their country to be able to express... (crosstalk) 

00:32:05
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
MARIA ...their political ideas freely and not... (crosstalk) 

00:32:05
WINTER C. HAMADA Right. 

00:32:05
MARIA ...be persecuted. And that's the primary reason why my parents left. 

00:32:10
WINTER C. HAMADA Hmm. 

00:32:10
MARIA Being in the military, somebody like me who's against the war, who doesn't agree with, you know, just supporting what we're doing right now. 

00:32:20
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:32:20
MARIA It feels very strange. It feels like everyone has this mentality that we can't talk about whether we're pro or against the war. We just have to support the troops and, I mean, my husband is deployed... (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
WINTER C. HAMADA  Yeah. 

00:32:35
MARIA ...but I don't agree with what's going on, so it's this whole thing where I grew up being able to express my political ideas, being able to always say what I thought about things. (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:32:45
MARIA And here it's like I can't because I'm gonna be looked down upon. (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
WINTER C. HAMADA Hmm. 

00:32:45
MARIA Because it's equated with being against the war. 

00:32:50
WINTER C. HAMADA Wow. 

00:32:50
MARIA So, it just, it puts a lot of stress. It puts, it's like I don't wanna talk about it. I don't wanna deal with it and another way, I can't be myself. 

00:33:00
WINTER C. HAMADA Right. So, even more so, you're finding things that you can't talk about. 

00:33:05
MARIA Yeah. 

00:33:05
WINTER C. HAMADA  Yeah. Wow. It sounds like these two parts of your identity are in conflict with each other. 

00:33:15
MARIA They are. I mean, I wanna support my husband and I wanna be, you know, the good, supportive wife who's there and who agrees with what he's doing to a certain extent but... (crosstalk) 

00:33:30
WINTER C. HAMADA Hmm. 

00:33:30
MARIA ...it's not, I didn't enlist in the military, myself. 

00:33:35
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:33:35
MARIA I'm not in the military. I'm just living in that culture because we moved here. If I was home, I could talk to whoever I wanted about, anything about the war and they would understand that it's not that I'm not supporting my husband. 

00:33:50
WINTER C. HAMADA Hmm. 

00:33:50
MARIA But here, when you're living on a base. It's a different expectation, I think. 

00:33:55
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. So, not only do you have this side of you that you're, you're adjusting to the ethnic part, right, with, ah, to being Cuban and being in a community where there is very few Cubans. There's also the part, the military part, the political part. 

00:34:10
MARIA  Yeah. 

00:34:15
WINTER C. HAMADA Right, where you are not really in favor of this war that's going on, uhm, and normally, you'd be able to express yourself freely about that... (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
MARIA Uh hmm. 

00:34:25
WINTER C. HAMADA ...without feeling, you know, worried that people will judge you for that. Uhm, but since you've moved on base, you're afraid that if you say what's really on your mind, that people will turn their backs on you or... (crosstalk) 

00:34:35
MARIA  Exactly. 

00:34:40
WINTER C. HAMADA ...reject you. 

00:34:40
MARIA Yeah. 

00:34:40
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:34:40
MARIA So, so I don't. 

00:34:40
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. So, it makes sense to me that you would be feeling depressed if you can't even express yourself both ethnically and politically, right? Yeah. And so, I think it would be important for us to find ways to integrate these two parts of your identity. I think that will help, uhm, as we're trying to cope with the depression. 

00:35:05
MARIA Okay. 

00:35:05
WINTER C. HAMADA Okay. 

00:35:05
Multicultural Strategy 9 Highlighting Oppression and Privilege Highlighting the impact of societal oppression, privilege, status, and power on clients' thoughts, actions and feelings 

00:35:05
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  The next skill is highlighting oppression and privilege. Examining cultural barriers and advantages can help client see the impact of culture and help them prepare for success. 

00:35:35
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Puah, we've been talking about the difference between your cultural values and the values of the department and how that's made it difficult for you. I'm wondering if we could look at this from a slightly different angle? 

00:35:50
PUAH Sure. 

00:35:50
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS So, I have a difficult question. In your graduate school department this year, do you think that you've been discriminated against? 

00:35:55
PUAH  Ah, not directly, but I guess. 

00:36:05
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. Not directly but in indirect ways? 

00:36:05
PUAH Well, yeah. I mean, the professors are really friendly with the other males in my department. 

00:36:15
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Hmm. 

00:36:15
PUAH Yeah. 

00:36:15
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. Well, in what ways are the, the male professors more friendly with the male students? 

00:36:20
PUAH Well, there is this other guy who, uhm, my adviser asked to write a grant and they tend to talk about like going to football games together and stuff like that. 

00:36:30
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. And do you think that the camaraderie around things like talking about football and that kinda friendly thing, do you think that's related to than getting, to write grants and, and academic issues? 

00:36:45
PUAH Well, I think somewhat. (crosstalk) 

00:36:45
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. 

00:36:45
PUAH  I mean, yeah. I mean, definitely with my adviser, I felt that way. 

00:36:50
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  You feel that. (crosstalk) 

00:36:55
PUAH That being friends with the professor is, is helping him get on to projects that they're not asking me to do. 

00:37:00
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. And so, when you see the male professors and some of the male students talking about football and, and having a friendly relationship, how do you respond to that? 

00:37:10
PUAH I just tend to walk away. I mean, I'm not really into football, so, I wouldn't know how to join into the conversation. 

00:37:20
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. And then, because you don't feel comfortable having that kind of chummy conversation about football or sports or whatever, do you, do you, are you concerned that, that may mean that you're not giving, getting something. Do, do you think that, that means that you might not have some of the opportunities academically? 

00:37:40
PUAH Yeah. Definitely. 

00:37:40
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. So, uhm, so, with your adviser, you see him preferring the male student and giving him some opportunities that you haven't. How about some of the other women in the department? Do you know if some of the other female students have had, uhm, opportunities to work on grants or do you think they feel a little bit left out like you do? 

00:38:00
PUAH Actually, I haven't really asked anyone. I haven't really talked about this with anyone... (crosstalk) 

00:38:05
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS I see. 

00:38:05
PUAH ...before. No. 

00:38:05
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  Okay. What, why do you think you haven't compared notes with some of the female students? 

00:38:10
PUAH  'Coz I'm not sure if that's exactly what's going on and that I don't wanna insinuate that some things going on, that, when it's not. 

00:38:20
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. Okay. Do you think it would be helpful for you to talk to some of the other women in the department and, ah, see if they're experiencing some of the same things you have or they're experience is different? 

00:38:35
PUAH Sure. 

00:38:35
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Do you think that would be easy or difficult? 

00:38:40
PUAH Well, I think it's gonna be easier. I'm starting to get to know some of the women, so. 

00:38:45
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. Well, that's what I'm gonna recommend that you do, that you talk to some of the other women in the department and see if they've had the same... (crosstalk) 

00:38:50
PUAH Hmm. 

00:38:50
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS ...opportunities that the other male colleagues have or if they feel like you and they feel a little left out and that they don't have the same chances that the, the male students in your department did. 

00:39:05
PUAH Okay. 

00:39:05
Multicultural Strategy 10 Exploring Societal Expectations Exploring societal expectations and supporting informed decisions about which roles to embrace and which to discard 

00:39:05
WINTER C. HAMADA  The next strategy is exploring societal expectations. When clients don't recognize cultural prescriptions, it maybe useful to support and form decision-making. 

00:39:35
WINTER C. HAMADA Since your husband is deployed right now, it seems like the only community you've really been exposed to is the community of military wives, right? 

00:39:45
MARIA Yeah. I mean, right. 

00:39:45
WINTER C. HAMADA Yeah. In your observation, what is the role of a military wife? 

00:39:50
MARIA Well, it just seems that they, they'll stay on base most of the time. 

00:39:55
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:39:55
MARIA  They, uhm, most of them don't work because with the husband's money you can, you know, everything on base is really cheap. I mean, you can just... (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
WINTER C. HAMADA Hmm. 

00:40:05
MARIA  live on base. Uhm, so, as a military wife, I feel like I'm supposed to just stay home and be supportive and wait for him to come home. 

00:40:15
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. And probably, many of them have children that they're caring for. 

00:40:20
MARIA Yeah. Yeah. 

00:40:20
WINTER C. HAMADA But you, you don't have children. (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
MARIA No. 

00:40:20
WINTER C. HAMADA  So, so you, but you feel the need to stay home anyway? 

00:40:25
MARIA Uh hmm. 

00:40:25
WINTER C. HAMADA  Uh hmm. 

00:40:30
MARIA I mean, ideally, I would wanna move off base even if it's more expensive. 

00:40:35
WINTER C. HAMADA Hmm. 

00:40:35
MARIA But I don't know. My husband is not so thrilled about that idea. Since I'm not to familiar with Hawaii and the other neighborhoods. (crosstalk) 

00:40:40
WINTER C. HAMADA  Right. 

00:40:45
MARIA The, the base is safe and. 

00:40:45
WINTER C. HAMADA Right. So, one idea you've had is to maybe just move off base, pay a little extra money to do that, uhm, uhm, but your husband is concerned about your safety being in a new environment. 

00:40:55
MARIA  Yeah. 

00:41:00
WINTER C. HAMADA That makes sense. What else? 

00:41:00
MARIA Well, the other idea I've had is working. I mean, I don't do well with just staying home... (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
MARIA ...the whole day. And especially since, like we've talked before. I feel like I don't exactly fit in, in this community. 

00:41:15
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:41:15
MARIA Sometimes I think that if I had things to occupy my time, I would feel better. So, if I would go out and find a job. (crosstalk) 

00:41:20
WINTER C. HAMADA  Uh hmm. 

00:41:25
MARIA But I'm not sure. I mean, like I said he's not thrilled about that. He would rather that I stay in a safe environment. We don't need the money because... (crosstalk) 

00:41:30
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:41:30
MARIA  everything is pretty much covered, so. (crosstalk) 

00:41:35
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:41:35
MARIA But I've thought about it. 

00:41:40
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. So, it's not really about the money for you, right? (crosstalk) 

00:41:40
MARIA No. For me, it's about being able to do something different that I feel... (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
WINTER C. HAMADA Yeah. 

00:41:45
MARIA ...like I'm getting some satisfaction out of, right now, I'm not doing anything. 

00:41:50
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:41:50
MARIA I feel I'm being so unproductive, and almost wasting my time away and that's, I don't feel very well, you know. 

00:41:55
WINTER C. HAMADA And it probably just really emphasizes for you all of the, the things that make you feel different. 

00:42:05
MARIA Oh, yeah. 

00:42:05
WINTER C. HAMADA Right? 

00:42:05
MARIA Yeah. 

00:42:05
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. So, there is, ah, many expectations that you described so far having as a military wife right there is the, to be supportive, you know, you live on base, (crosstalk) 

00:42:20
MARIA Yeah. 

00:42:20
WINTER C. HAMADA you hang out with the other military wives, uhm, and then, your main role is, is to take care of the home kinda, you know, if you have kids take care of your kids. Uhm, you don't generally work and you don't have to leave base very often. 

00:42:35
MARIA Not really. No. 

00:42:40
WINTER C. HAMADA Yeah. 

00:42:40
MARIA Everything is there. 

00:42:40
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. So, it sounds like you're, because you're uncomfortable with the many expectations of being a military wife, uhm, it's made this idea of living off base and maybe even becoming a more productive contributing member of the larger society. Uhm, those values seemed like they have even more important for you now. 

00:43:10
MARIA Yeah. I mean, I have an education and everything and I'm not doing anything with it. I'm not doing anything... (crosstalk) 

00:43:15
WINTER C. HAMADA Yeah. 

00:43:15
MARIA ...at all, so. 

00:43:15
WINTER C. HAMADA Okay. 

00:43:15
Multicultural Strategy 11 Supporting Social Action Supporting clients who participate in social action in order to change oppressive societal structures or practices 

00:43:15
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  My next de, demonstration will involve supporting social action. When clients have been impacted negatively by societal structures, they may need help deciding whether to take action. 

00:43:45
PUAH Last week, you asked me to find out if other women in the department are working on grants. 

00:43:50
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS What did you find out? 

00:43:55
PUAH None of them were working on grants. 

00:43:55
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. And what was that like to find that out? 

00:44:00
PUAH Well, we all went out for pizza and we're talking about things that go on in the department and with our advisers and I found out that none of the women were asked to make grants. 

00:44:10
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. And more generally, did they feel unsupported and left out like you did? 

00:44:15
PUAH Yeah. I mean, they also, the, the same way, like they're being left out indirectly, is not told to leave the of, office or that they can't come to football games, but just kind of excluded. 

00:44:30
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS So, it's not that overt discrimination like women aren't welcome here... (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
PUAH Hmm. 

00:44:35
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS ...but it's more that male students get privileges and attention that female students don't. 

00:44:40
PUAH Well, we definitely all feel that way. 

00:44:45
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. Okay. What was that like for you to know that your experience was shared by your female colleagues? 

00:44:50
PUAH Well, it felt good and I felt, I was happy to know that I wasn't the only one who felt that way. 

00:44:55
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS So, you're not being discriminated against, because of. (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
PUAH Because I'm not smart enough or because. (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Because you're not smart enough, but that it maybe that the, the department is in the support of, for, for female students. 

00:45:10
PUAH Uh hmm. 

00:45:10
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS So what, what would you wanna do now that you've found out that you're not the only one who feels this way? 

00:45:15
PUAH Well, we talked about that over pizza. (laughs) 

00:45:15
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  Uh hmm. 

00:45:20
PUAH And we really don't know what we can do. So, (crosstalk) 

00:45:20
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. 

00:45:20
PUAH can you help us with that? 

00:45:25
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Yeah. I think I can help you identify some different possibilities and then you can decide how to proceed. Hmm. Well, one thing, uhm, one thing that occurs to me is that you've taken a really important first step. You've sought out social support from, from some of your female classmates, so that's probably a good place to start. You all could go out for pizza once a week and talk about your experiences... (crosstalk) 

00:45:50
PUAH Uh hmm. 

00:45:50
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS ...could become, uhm, women in science support group. 

00:45:55
PUAH And that would be fun. 

00:45:55
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay so that's... (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
PUAH Or we could also, maybe I could go to that female prof, professor I talked to earlier. (crosstalk) 

00:46:00
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Uh hmm. Right. 

00:46:00
PUAH And we can kind of tell her what we think is going on. 

00:46:05
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS I think that'd be really valuable. I think that she'd have a lot of insight as a female professor working in a predominantly male department and she might help you figure out wa, some options that I might not be able to. 

00:46:15
PUAH  Yeah. What else can we do though? 

00:46:20
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. I think that's a good place to start. At the institutional level, the, uhm, within the department, the Chair of the Department is responsible to make sure that students aren't discriminated against, so, uhm, so, if you felt uncomfortable, you could talk to the Chair. 

00:46:35
PUAH Oh, I, I don't think we feel comfortable... (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. 

00:46:40
PUAH ...about that. 

00:46:40
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. Then, another resource in the university is the, ah, Ombud's office which is an office that, that helps people who feel like they aren't being treated fairly and gives them a place to be heard and that they may be able to take action and help you consider other options. 

00:47:00
PUAH Where, do you have information on that? 

00:47:00
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS I do. I think I have a brochure here. So, this is, uhm, this is the, the information about their office and, uhm, they can help you decide whether you wanna deal with this informally or whether you might wanna file a formal complaint. They, if you need to communicate with the Department Chair, they can do some of that kind of communication or mediation, so they'll be able to talk to you for more of the, the institutional level of what things you can do. 

00:47:30
PUAH Okay. 

00:47:30
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS I wanna be real supportive of, kind of that how to get the emotional support that you need, uhm, but they can help you with more of the, the institutional stuff. 

00:47:40
PUAH Okay. I can look into that. 

00:47:40
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. Yes. So, what I'd recommend is that you talk to the other women in the department and decide which of these things might fit best as a next step. 

00:47:50
PUAH Okay. 

00:47:50
Multicultural Strategy 12 Integrating Spiritual Awareness Integrating clients' spiritual awareness or faith development into holistic growth 

00:47:50
WINTER C. HAMADA  The next multicultural skill involves integrating spiritual awareness. Promoting spirituality can support clients' search for meaning and enrich cultural identity. 

00:48:20
WINTER C. HAMADA  So the last time we met, we talked about maybe finding a, ah, church that offers a Spanish mass... (crosstalk) 

00:48:30
MARIA Yeah. 

00:48:30
WINTER C. HAMADA ...as a way to maybe you connect to the Hispanic community. How'd that go? 

00:48:35
MARIA It actually went pretty well. 

00:48:35
WINTER C. HAMADA  Great. 

00:48:40
MARIA I went to the church and it was nice because the mass was in Spanish. So, (crosstalk) 

00:48:40
WINTER C. HAMADA  Uh hmm. 

00:48:45
MARIA I had people there that were speaking in Spanish. (crosstalk) 

00:48:45
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:48:45
MARIA It was a nice change of pace. I'm very used to having people around me speak Spanish. So it was nice. 

00:48:50
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:48:50
MARIA Uhm, and then they have like, ah, women support group there... (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
WINTER C. HAMADA Hmm. 

00:48:55
MARIA ...which I started attending, like I'm gonna go to their next meeting, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:48:55
MARIA  and they seem really nice and they seem very accepting so I feel like, I'll be able to fit in... (crosstalk) 

00:49:05
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:49:05
MARIA ...really well there. I enjoyed it. 

00:49:05
WINTER C. HAMADA Well, so you found a, uhm, supportive group there, too... (crosstalk) 

00:49:10
MARIA Yeah. 

00:49:10
WINTER C. HAMADA ...that of beyond... (crosstalk) 

00:49:15
MARIA Uh hmm. 

00:49:15
WINTER C. HAMADA ...the, the Spanish part. And are all the women in the group Cuban or is it, it's a mix. (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
MARIA No, they're different. It's a mix, (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:49:20
MARIA different Hispanic women. There're some that aren't Hispanic, different cultures, but... (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:49:25
MARIA ...people had generally enjoyed speaking Spanish. So. (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
WINTER C. HAMADA Great. And what else have you noticed about being at the church? 

00:49:30
MARIA Well, one thing I was really, it took me by surprise but it made me feel really good was doing my prayers in Spanish. Being able to do all of the prayers during the mass and the rosary and all of that in Spanish reminded me of a little bit of how I was before. 

00:49:50
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh-huh. 

00:49:50
MARIA Little bit of how I was back home, that part of me that I was missing, I guess. 

00:49:55
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. So not only have you found a source of social support, an important source of social support there at the church, but you've also more importantly, it sounds like, really reconnected with your spiritual identity. 

00:50:10
MARIA Yeah, I did, I did. 

00:50:15
WINTER C. HAMADA Wow. That's really positive. 

00:50:15
MARIA Yeah. I think I've forgotten how important that was for me. 

00:50:20
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. So, I know how before you had, had hypothesized that in order to feel fulfilled, you would need to do a couple of different things, right? 

00:50:35
MARIA Uh hmm. 

00:50:35
WINTER C. HAMADA And you need to move off-base perhaps or you would need to get a job and become a contributing member of the largest... (crosstalk) 

00:50:40
MARIA Yeah. 

00:50:40
WINTER C. HAMADA  society. 

00:50:45
MARIA Uh hmm. 

00:50:45
WINTER C. HAMADA Remember saying that? (laughs) 

00:50:45
MARIA Yeah. I do. 

00:50:45
WINTER C. HAMADA Yeah. And so, now, though, it sounds like going in this church, being able to pray in Spanish, being around other people who are speaking Spanish and also having that social support in this women's group has really helped you to recapture your spiritual identity. And now that you've recaptured that, uhm, you have meaning in your life even now. 

00:51:10
MARIA Uh hmm. Yeah. That sounds pretty accurate. 

00:51:15
WINTER C. HAMADA Okay. Great. I'm so glad that you went. 

00:51:15
Multicultural Strategy 13 Becoming Aware of the Therapist's Worldview Becoming aware of one's own worldview and how it impacts your role as a psychotherapist 

00:51:15
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  My final demonstration will involve becoming aware of the therapist's worldview. Acknowledging your own cultural values will alert you to possible biases that might influence your work with clients. 

00:51:50
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS So, Puah, I'm curious. What did your friends and you decided to do? 

00:51:55
PUAH Well, we went to the Ombud's office and they talked about the different options that we have available to us. 

00:52:00
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS And what kinds of options did they... (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
PUAH Well... (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS ...gave at(ph). 

00:52:05
PUAH ...they said that a formal complaint is an option and some of my classmates wanna go in that direction and that kind of makes me a little nervous. 

00:52:15
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. And what, what is it about a formal complaint that makes you nervous? 

00:52:20
PUAH Well, I don't wanna make waves and like, I'm finally starting to get into the hang of things and my grade are really getting better and I just don't wanna make more problems... (crosstalk) 

00:52:30
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. 

00:52:30
PUAH (inaudible ). 

00:52:33
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS What does it mean for you to make waves or make problems? 

00:52:35
PUAH Well, uhm, you know, kinda step, speaking out against something that I feel uncomfortable with against professors who are teaching my classes might change things... (crosstalk) 

00:52:45
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. 

00:52:45
PUAH ...for me. What would you do if you were in my situation or our situation? 

00:52:50
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. Well, I, I don't wanna bias your, your decision-making. 

00:52:55
PUAH  I'm just kind of curious about what... (crosstalk) 

00:53:00
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. 

00:53:00
PUAH ...you would do. 

00:53:00
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. Well, I could talk to you about what I might do but I wanna make sure that that's in the context of the fact that you and I are different people and you might make a different decision. 

00:53:10
PUAH Okay. I think, I can do that. 

00:53:15
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS I think that given my background, I'm pretty comfortable with kinda formal institutional change, that I have been taught that people should follow the rules and if people aren't following the rules, that you can make a complaint and that, uhm, you know, as a part of a university, I feel like if a department is not providing a healthy environment that the authorities in the university should know about that and that they should have a, uhm, there should be methods for correcting the problems. But I also know that that doesn't always happen and that, uhm, that there are other informal methods that might be more effective or more comfortable. 

00:53:55
PUAH  Well, yeah, like, I mean, I really enjoyed the going out for pizza or just dinner... (crosstalk) 

00:54:05
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Uh hmm. 

00:54:05
PUAH ...once a week and talking about it but I don't really felt comfortable with the filing of formal complaint. (crosstalk) 

00:54:10
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. 

00:54:10
PUAH I don't think with that. 

00:54:10
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS So for you, getting the informal social support has been really helpful. 

00:54:15
PUAH Yeah. I mean, now I have study friends, I mean, it's beyond just dealing with what's going on with the male professors and male classmates in our department. 

00:54:25
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. So you're, you're finding ways that are to, to change your situation. You came in here because you weren't, you weren't doing well on tests and you weren't sure you could make it and you've found social support that has been, helped you feel more confident and more successful in the department. 

00:54:45
PUAH Yeah. 

00:54:45
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS And that right now, it, it, you're not comfortable going, uhm, going the way, have a formal complaint like, like some of your classmates. 

00:54:50
PUAH  Yeah. And I'm also kinda worried about that because what if they see, and I initiated this whole thing, and now when it's coming to it... (crosstalk) 

00:55:05
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Uh hmm. 

00:55:05
PUAH I'm gonna step back, and. (crosstalk) 

00:55:05
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. So you're concerned that some of the other women in the department might feel abandoned that you don't go on, sign on to a formal complaint. 

00:55:15
PUAH Oh, yeah. 

00:55:15
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Yeah. How do you think that you could communicate that to them? Could you talk about some of your cultural background that makes, makes it uncomf, might make it uncomfortable to do work toward institutional change but are, is more consistent with social support? 

00:55:30
PUAH Yeah, I could tell them about what it's like or for me and why... (crosstalk) 

00:55:35
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. 

00:55:35
PUAH  it would be uncomfortable and I think we've gotten close enough that they might be willing to listen at least. 

00:55:45
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS Okay. 'Coz I think it's important for you to make decisions that are consistent with your, your own values and with your cultural background, and then I think it'll be important then to try and communicate to, that to the people around you. 

00:55:55
PUAH Okay. 

00:55:55
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS I think the most important thing is that you're finding ways to be more successful and to get the support you need so that you can live up to your potential as a student. 

00:56:05
PUAH Okay. 

00:56:05
JEFF E. BROOKS-HARRIS  Okay. 

00:56:10
Multicultural Strategy 14 Reducing Cultural Biases Recognizing possible cultural biases and presenting options with as little partiality as possible 

00:56:10
WINTER C. HAMADA  The last strategy I will be demonstrating is reducing cultural biases. To reduce personal biases, counselor should explore multiple options and encourage clients to make their own decisions. 

00:56:40
MARIA So we keep on talking about me moving on, off-base and... (crosstalk) 

00:56:45
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:56:45
MARIA ...what I should do, and I finally found a job so I can afford to do it. 

00:56:50
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:56:50
MARIA But now, I'm confused, like I don't know what, what I should do. What do you think I should do? 

00:56:55
WINTER C. HAMADA Well, staying versus leaving the only option you have? 

00:57:00
MARIA I don't know. 

00:57:00
WINTER C. HAMADA Well, I wonder if there might be a way for you to do both things? You know, often when, uhm, a person is struggling with the decision that, like this, a big decision like this. 

00:57:10
MARIA Uh hmm. 

00:57:10
WINTER C. HAMADA Uhm, it's often helpful to explore both the positives and the negatives of the situation. 

00:57:15
MARIA Okay. 

00:57:15
WINTER C. HAMADA  Uhm, how about we start with the negatives first? What are some of the negative things that you attribute to living on-base? 

00:57:25
MARIA Okay. So staying on-base. Well, one that I feel like I don't fit in, and it's that I don't feel comfortable with that community. 

00:57:35
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:57:35
MARIA Uhm, I can't be myself. 

00:57:40
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:57:40
MARIA If I, when I'm on-base, I feel like I'm not living an ordinary life. I feel kinda sheltered. 

00:57:50
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:57:50
MARIA So, there's so many. (crosstalk) 

00:57:50
WINTER C. HAMADA I think you mentioned feeling bored in the past, too? 

00:57:55
MARIA Yeah. 

00:57:55
WINTER C. HAMADA Yeah. 

00:57:55
MARIA There's just not a lot to do on-base. (crosstalk) 

00:57:55
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. Okay. So, basically that the negatives of staying on-base involve not having much to do and not feeling like you fit in? 

00:58:05
MARIA Uh hmm. 

00:58:05
WINTER C. HAMADA  That you're not... (crosstalk) 

00:58:10
MARIA Yeah. 

00:58:10
WINTER C. HAMADA ...comfortable doing the same things that the other women do on-base or the others, spouses, military spouses do on-base. 

00:58:15
MARIA Uh hmm. 

00:58:15
WINTER C. HAMADA  Okay. Any other negatives before we move on to the positives? 

00:58:20
MARIA I think those pretty much kind of the big ones.

00:58:45
WINTER C. HAMADA my goodness. Yeah. 

00:58:50
MARIA So in that sense, it's really convenient. It's really, and my husband really wants me to do that, so... (crosstalk) 

00:58:55
WINTER C. HAMADA That's right. 

00:58:55
MARIA ...he has peace of mind when I'm on-base and, I mean, I do wanna make him happy, too. 

00:59:00
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:59:00
MARIA He's off at war and I don't wanna give him more stress. 

00:59:05
WINTER C. HAMADA Sure. 

00:59:05
MARIA So. 

00:59:05
WINTER C. HAMADA So, basically, the positives and there are quite a number of positives. 

00:59:10
MARIA Uh hmm. 

00:59:10
WINTER C. HAMADA There's the safety factor. 

00:59:10
MARIA Yeah. 

00:59:10
WINTER C. HAMADA  Great. And there's the fact that your, your husband would feel more comfortable with you there and then there's the whole convenience factor. (crosstalk) 

00:59:20
MARIA Uh hmm. 

00:59:20
WINTER C. HAMADA It is a lot cheaper just to stay on-base, do your shopping on-base. 

00:59:25
MARIA Yeah. 

00:59:25
WINTER C. HAMADA Great. So, given those pros and cons, what do you think? 

00:59:30
MARIA  Well, I mean, now that I'm working and... (crosstalk) 

00:59:35
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:59:35
MARIA ...I can go to work during the day, then I'm not on-base the whole entire day so that, (crosstalk) 

00:59:40
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:59:40
MARIA  I guess takes care of the boredom factor. 

00:59:45
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:59:45
MARIA Uhm, and since things are cheaper on-base, I can save money... (crosstalk) 

00:59:50
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

00:59:50
MARIA ...and I don't know. I guess the only compromise I can think is maybe stay on there for a while, save money, and once my husband comes back, we can like buy a house... (crosstalk) 

01:00:00
WINTER C. HAMADA Uh hmm. 

01:00:00

WINTER C. HAMADA ...with you, right? 

01:00:10
MARIA Yeah. Yeah. 

01:00:10
WINTER C. HAMADA Right, so, you know, Maria, it sounds like you've really found effective ways to adapt to your new cultural environment. And now that you're able to integrate both the ethnic part of yourself and the political part, it seems like your depression is really lifting.
