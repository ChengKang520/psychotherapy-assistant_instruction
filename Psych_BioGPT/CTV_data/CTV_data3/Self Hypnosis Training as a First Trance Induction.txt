Self Hypnosis Training as a First Trance Induction

00:00:30
MILTON H. ERICKSON I first will explain a little bit, how's this idea have been uh… developed? What I am, what I will demonstrate today. Umm… from 1982 to 1986, I was working at University Clinic in Heidelberg Germany in the Department of Speech uh… Pathology and it was my first job after studying and they gave me umm… some psych, Psychotropic voice, uh… disorder patients. Umm… so majority have been very experienced schoolteachers who usually could only teach for one or two hours and then the voice was going low and then they are going home, and cannot work anymore, and usually, the doctors have uh… told so many times, you should rest more, you should uh… now stay at home for two weeks and really fix the situation, but these people are so perfectionists and so, so responsible, they thought, the school boys and girls cannot live without them. In science, in analytical literature, it was described as very, very perfectionist people, very responsible people, helping people, supporting people, uh… also usually active in politics, active in church umm… and so they again and again have going too early and finally showing up at, at University Clinic and trying to find a faster solution to be as fast as possible uh… healthy again. And actually, this has been coming for a medical solution, for medication or for injections into voice chords, but now maybe a speech therapists, maybe is therapy but not a, not a uh… psychotherapy and I'm, I'm not crazy, I'm not sick. I will prove that the psychotherapist umm… they have been very energetic, those are medical profession to send some to the psychotherapists and sitting with a lot of resistance and umm… calorie meat, which kind of food I should buy and counseling me of a better life style. But, uh… not have been accepting uh… somehow and then I should teach that people relaxation techniques, to relax the voice chord and things like… they've always… asking questions and never did something. And one of this clients, the women teacher have been saying to me, "If you're looking at me and I shall close the eyes umm… and should be like this is impossible." So I said, "Okay, and so we will sit parallel." I said, "We will sit parallel. I first will explain the technique." And said, "I will demonstrate it, I will do self-hypnosis and you'll use me as a role model. How I do self hypnosis. I speak loud, you be silent and you just follow me." And she likes the idea. She told, "Why not, I hearing a new technique. He's doing all the work, I going with him." And at the end she was telling me if I'm a good boy or not. So like in school, so everything is okay again and uh… and this time, I also was looking to a lot of storytelling books to find a story which is somehow mirroring this resistance. My voice has a problem, but I have not a problem. I saw people have problem, but I have no problem and I found in a book of Ed Ruche uh… uh… a Sufi master living in, in uh… in England. I found a perfect story, it's a lion story. It's a old story from Iran from Persia, maybe 600 to 700 years old. And this whole thing work so good, so client was surprised that uh… how deep she was in the relaxation that more and more used these techniques sitting side by side, uh… going very far away from old traditional hypnosis techniques. I collecting old hypnosis books, 100 or 150 years old. And if you look at old photos and these hypnosis books sometimes hypnotists standing this way, staring into his eyes of his client, very dominating, umm… and this is very far away. I'm sitting parallel, I'm not looking at the client, I'm, I, I'm doing myself self-hypnosis and not doing something with the client. Uh… but uh… after sometime, the method silently changed more and more and uh… in some way, it is a very good way to do it first trance induction with the, with the, with the patient. So I was, we'll later see. I will go away from my self-hypnosis and work with the client. And umm… so, I do this now. If I do business coaching, if I call it mental training with sports people, if I have chronic pain, patience, whatever, usually I'll start now with this technique. This is my first trance induction, the first trance experience I give to my clients. Umm… part of technique is modified, if it's more of psychotherapeutic or more business coaching of course. Umm… and now, we have here (inaudible ) and she will uh… tell us briefly umm… about this uh… problem and even better. What is your goal? What you would like to achieve? 

00:06:40
UNKNOWN So… so the, the goal is for me to be able to run and to hike and I feel like, like I would normally do and how I did before. The problem that gives in way of that sight now is that my thighs feels very tight and heavy, and it feels like, I'm carrying 100 pounds when I, when I walk or when I hike umm… so I tire more easily. So, after hiking up, you know, I can hike up a little mountain, umm… you know, up to, you know, for a couple of miles or a mile, but I'm, I feel it and it, it haven't worked. Umm… while it used to be something fun and light. Umm… so the, a, you know, there are times where it felt uh… most of it had cleared. So in couple of, one of them was uh… actually umm… I had to, I had to go some where and my… uh… to help my daughter. And it just, I mean, I knew I needed to be here, I just stopped, I was thinking, so my appointments did go bad and, and that for 24 hours, I just felt light, I could carry my luggage and didn't feel like I was carrying extra as I was walking and that my walk was fine. Uh… it just lasted 24 hours. There were other times where I'd feel better, you know, I do some work, it feels better, it's temporary, but it's like 20%, 20%, 30% and then it goes back. So it's never felt completely normal uh… for a while. 

00:08:40
MILTON H. ERICKSON How long this is going on? 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN Uh… it's, it started and it wasn't as intense, but a very first time I noticed it was about maybe, in the '90s where I used to go for a run and come back and I'd be energized and umm… and around then it happened after I had had some surgery, I would go and I really would feel like I'm dragging after my, my walk or my run. It's like, it would give me an effort to get back as it goes to being energized and uh… and ready to… to just, yeah. 

00:09:20
MILTON H. ERICKSON Okay, okay. 

00:09:25
UNKNOWN So, it, it, so now, it's like, now, I don't go running. I just go walking or hiking and it's working. It's how it works. 

00:09:30
MILTON H. ERICKSON Okay, okay. So, I will, I will teach you hypnosis technique and you and so whom you can at the same time see how I'm teaching it and at the same time you can also follow, you can also do it yourself. You can umm… have your own goals and umm… I, at the end I will tell a little something umm… when I'm teaching groups, I'm teaching a lot of hypnosis groups around the world. And sometimes I asking three, four people in the group for such, for such a goal and I'm demonstrating that I can teach you to one primary client and also at the same time I can walk with some other people in the, in the, in the same group. And, and I will tell at the end in which way I'm using this in, in, in a, in a group situation umm… the modify the story in some little ways. Uh… so I'm using always this lion story, umm… but in having told it so many times, I can modify it. Uh… people who have children and grandchildren are knowing, if people, if the children are wanting the same story 20 times, 25 times, it's the way you're telling the story, if you're very boring and slowing down so children fall to sleep before the end of the story and if you're very dramatic, they cannot sleep anymore. Umm… so you, but you have to, have to know it's a basic story, very good. So you can make such little modification. Umm… and I will, I will uh… now primarily work with you and have nobody, have not asked anybody into, into group uh… also because I'm not working in my own language. It's I'm pretty good in English, but I'm far away from what I can do in Sherman(ph), of course. Umm… 

00:11:45
UNKNOWN I can do French too. 

00:11:45
MILTON H. ERICKSON Oh! In French, I was very poor in school. 

00:11:50
UNKNOWN Okay! 

00:11:50
MILTON H. ERICKSON I just can understand a little bit, but not speak much. Umm… okay, so, hypnosis umm… you're experienced in hypnotherapy yourself? 

00:12:10
UNKNOWN Umm… I do very light. I mean, I do a lot of focusing some hypnosis, but I do combination of things. 

00:12:15
MILTON H. ERICKSON Okay, okay. So we do enough a combination of things. 

00:12:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:12:20
MILTON H. ERICKSON Yes, okay. Somehow as the problem is beginning I'll ready with semiotic analysis, because some English doctor around 1830 uh… which has invented semiotic analysis said by, uh… it's a way of some historians were saying, it's birth was before in France, in France was it invented, I have not followed this new idea, but some of my colleagues saying it is true. It's umm… Hypnosis meaning sleep, but it's not a sleeping state, it's, it's man who made semiotic hypnosis is English doctor wanted to change it later in monoideaism. Concentrated on one idea of monoideaism and that would be, actually it's a better word being concentrated on one spot, being relaxed and very concentrated at the same time. That's the reason why usually when say uh… in cinema showing hypnosis, they have a crystal ball and saying uh… look at this crystal ball and you hear, only hear my voice and nothing else. So visual monoideaism, only one point, the crystal ball umm… and only hearing the voice, so do you know what a very inexpensive crystal ball is? 

00:13:45
UNKNOWN No. 

00:13:45
MILTON H. ERICKSON Let's do on this spot and it's a profit. 

00:13:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:13:50
MILTON H. ERICKSON So, that's very inexpensive. So you can buy a crystal ball, but you can use any, there are these spot or you can use a ring, you can put your watch on the floor actually, any, any spot and so carpet is good enough. So, I first explain, how's the technique? And then I will demonstrate it. I will do it. So first I will explain the steps. 

00:14:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:14:15
MILTON H. ERICKSON And then you will do it later. So in first… by the way, it's a handouts on, now should be on survey page, so it's a outline of what I'm doing is on survey page. Also say story I'm telling a long version of the story is on survey page, already of the Erickson Foundation, uh… in the hand out section. Umm… so you're looking on one spot and saying four times what you're seeing. Uh… I see this pot, I see this complex pattern of the carpet, I see into peripheral, feel somebody is coming in and walking into home, now again somebody is moving, moving in the background. Four times what I'm hearing. I'm hearing this monotone ventilation noise, we hearing this all time and not hearing it. On my left side, somebody doing something, I can hear this against this ventilation noise and then four times feeling what my body is feeling the temperature of the hands and temperature of the feet, uh… so that I have to swallow and so on. What I'm seeing, hearing, feeling three times, seeing, hearing, feeling, two times, one time. I had the clients told me, it's not long enough. I said it, it five, four, three, two, one. You have to find, what is the best technique for you? In my experience from 90%, 95%, four, three, two, one is okay. And if you have played on some experience, if you exercise it usually, so old technique is, is, is going briefer and briefer. Umm… I do not know if anybody have seen (inaudible ) going to a trance. He's just making, it looks like if somebody is taking some electricity out. He's not using a formal technique anymore and I did it so many times. I also can go very fast now. So, but for training things this four, three, two, one, mechanical thing, it's a very good way. First, with open eyes, second step, with closed eyes, you go to real, you go to a real memory, you go to something which you have experienced. I usually go to a beach on a beautiful island. I was many years before. I do as if I would be at this beach and I do as the same at this beach in my memory, four, three, two, one, seeing, hearing, feeling. I just uh… demonstrate it briefly and we'll do it later in one set. I see blue water, I see a lot of sailing boats, I see this Upper Island in some distance, blue sky, I hear strong winds, very strong wind today, I hear some children voices, I hear some music in the background, I can feel this warm wind on my skin, I can feel the sun. It's very strong today, I feel a pain in my left elbow., very uh… it's not much sand, it's uh… beach is not very comfortable and so on. 

00:17:55
UNKNOWN You're doing it with your eyes open and that's the memory? 

00:17:55
MILTON H. ERICKSON Inside, inside now, when I do it really, I have the eyes closed. 

00:18:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:18:00
MILTON H. ERICKSON So second step you do with the eyes closed. 

00:18:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, that's what I thought. 

00:18:05
MILTON H. ERICKSON Yeah, okay. Uh… but here for explaining I do it with eyes open, then we do it later, at this point we have to eyes open. But, I have few clients in my career, maybe 10, 15 who prefer to do also to same, set, sit with open eyes. Maybe say, I need some more control or I do not know, uh… so I had some clients who had their eyes open or chances taken. Even when they do it alone at home, they have eyes open. Umm… then at the first step, the real work will be done. At this stage, it's a chronic pain patient or women who is coming, who want to learn self-hypnosis for delivering, so baby will get a technique uh… for pain control. Umm… or a sports man will get some mental training technique or somebody who has allergy will have the special technique. So, books uh… internationally like buying Almond Self-Hypnosis where you can everyday get a lot of techniques for specific topics. And then, when we're doing hypno, I will do it little loud, you'll do it in silence for yourself, you'll not speak. I will do it loud, loud, you only will use me as a, as a model. If somebody is sneezing like here, we will, we both will hear it, but maybe, when I do it in my office sometimes, my dog is barking, I have the dog. Maybe, I hear the dog, but somebody also is hearing a car driving outside, because it sound, it's a same car he is driving. So I'm only uh… giving some model, but you're concentrating what you seeing, hearing, feeling. If I have a uh… strange feeling on my nose, you can feel warm feet and, and have not I have a same strange feeling. 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN Okay, so I do not speak what I see or hear or feel. 

00:20:10
MILTON H. ERICKSON No, no. 

00:20:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:20:15
MILTON H. ERICKSON You had told me, you also do it silently, it's better to do it inside you can uh… speak silently inside. 

00:20:20
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:20:25
MILTON H. ERICKSON Since I usually repeat in when I work with the client who three times said, I speak loud and you speak silent, because at many times when I start it, I say, I see my point, the client also say, "I see my point." You're silent and I'm, sometimes I say, "Maybe, he's a better hypnotist." And so at the end I'm sitting with arm levitation and umm… so client had disappeared and I wake up. So I speak loud and the client is speaking is uh… silent. Umm… and so, in the first step so I speak loud, you silent and when you're going to this memory, I will not again say something about my island experience. I did it for first one, two years. Too many clients told me, "How can I concentrate on my memory if you speak about self or the people who are falling into water and such things. That is disturbing." So at this point, I will help you to go more into your own memory and then I will tell the story, this lion story, and inside the lion story, I will modify the lion story. It's not so original lion story, I will modify it in a… it will be a story into story into story into story somehow uh… in which I will address your goal. 

00:21:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:21:55
MILTON H. ERICKSON And you can be curious if you find out, what was original story? And what is umm… modification I've told in for you? 

00:22:05
UNKNOWN All right! 

00:22:05
MILTON H. ERICKSON And that's the end. I will say, you can count from 1 to 20 and can reorient yourself or you can use your own technique which you're knowing from focusing or whatever. Okay? 

00:22:20
UNKNOWN Okay. Umm… 

00:22:20
MILTON H. ERICKSON Something disturbing. 

00:22:20
UNKNOWN No, I just want some water. 

00:22:20
MILTON H. ERICKSON You just have it. 

00:22:25
[sil.] 

00:22:35
MILTON H. ERICKSON Hence, you can sit in this posture, it's better when the hands come up, touching each other, but if you… during the whole thing, I want to do something else, feeling more comfortable, do whatever you want, okay. 

00:22:50
UNKNOWN Okay! 

00:22:55
MILTON H. ERICKSON Okay, so I do not need this anymore. 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:05
MILTON H. ERICKSON So and anybody who wants also to do it can do it. Umm… so I focus now on my spot on the floor which I have chosen, I see the spot, I see somebody walking in the background. I see my client was just moving the hands and the fingers and it's a peripheral feel. I still see this one spot. I hear this monotone constant ventilation noise. It's very uh… monotone. We hearing it the whole time and not hearing it. Not much else to hear, only this one ventilation sound. The same sound, I have to swallow like many times before I feel my feet on the floor. My hands are warm. One hand a little bit warmer than the other hand. I still see this one spot. Everything looks a little bit more bright, more intensive. This monotone ventilation, you know, somebody else into warmness making a little sound. I hear my client uh… breathing and little bit more relaxed on my side, her shoulders are relaxing, breathing uh… this floor is, the view of the floor is changing, it's some very bright somehow, very interesting looking and I hear this back on ventilation, nothing else. Swallowing, breathing… This one point, this ventilation sound have been more silent now. 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:50
MILTON H. ERICKSON Breathing and closing the eyes and go into really nice memory. Maybe, you have chosen already this memory, maybe you have one or two or three from which you can choose, just take one and go to this memory and four, three, two, one, seeing, hearing, feeling in your own tempo, in your own version. And if I'm telling you, you can hear and you're still seeing or already feeling, my voice can be like a car way during the background. Sometimes we're hearing music coming from some neighborhood. We hearing some music and not hearing some music. And so you sometimes can hear my voice and sometimes can be in your nice memory. Of course, inside car, if we're driving the car and our favorite music is coming, we're hearing. If a spectacular news is coming and so that you hear, hearing about what they're telling you. So you sometimes can hear more consciously and sometimes my voice can be like a background music. And you can go more and more into nice memory. The conscious mind can usually only have one or two things at the same time in mind. The unconscious mind can have several things at the same time, multitasking can be here in phoenix learning self hypnosis can have a personal goal feeling more light, can be in this nice memory, can compare this technique, this meditation technique and think about all the boats slight focusing and on a fifth or sixth level additionally can also hearing a story. The story forms a lion and so conscious mind can be curious what was original story and the unconscious mind more and more can prepare to work on this goal. And so conscious mind can analyze the whole thing from a professional point of view and you're not a part of supreme can activate resources, can remember the exceptions being with the dollar. 

00:28:55
[sil.] 

00:29:00
MILTON H. ERICKSON And the story and what is the original story and what's the special story. It's a very old story from time where no books are existing, where the old generations have put life experience into stories, to teach the next generations, strategies, so it's something that not everybody have to find our own strategy to solve again and again the same problem. And so, story forms a lion and this lion is living in a forest, not typical for lion, typical fairy tale style and it's very been indeed. It's this permanent background wind. But, the lion is so used to hear wind, he's hearing the wind and not hearing the wind. And he has a beautiful lake, a little lake with fresh water. One of the reasons why he's living at this place, but because it's prominently windy, the water is permanently in the ripples, little waves. So water is never like a milk. It's always like little waves, fresh water and sometimes the lion decided to go for hunting. 

00:30:50
[sil.] 

00:30:55
MILTON H. ERICKSON People who are knowing lion, lions are knowing in, and the group of lions, the women are hunting, so you can transform the lion, it's a male lion to a women lion. And the lioness is going for hunting, going more and more concentrated, being absolutely focused, having a goal, smelling the forest and not smelling so forest, hearing the wind and not hearing the wind. Somehow, unconsciously seeing the trees and not seeing so trees, very alert and running, moving, feeling the body and not feeling the body. Few times a little bit a more conscious trump uh… little stop. And after a little while going more and more automatically and suddenly somehow, leaving this forest, the sun is shining, it's hot, but being so concentrated, very, very concentrated on this goal, somehow feeling, the sun is shining, feeling the different temperature and not feeling so different temperature. Smelling of animals, the plants and not smelling it. And suddenly somehow coming back, coming back, the needs are coming back, feeling thirsty, running and running and forgetting the body and suddenly thirsty of course, enough control, enough power, enough energy. So lion can go back in aggression, can go back to this beautiful lake, but it's a long way. And lions and especially lioness can smell water about a large distance. Very importantly, if young lioness uh… and the flock and smelling water, there's some way of water not far away, life experience, intuition, intelligence, collecting the data, smelling, intuitively orienting yourself into high direction. And there's this little lake, blue water, no wind, fled like a mirror and thirsty. And the lion is going to this water, but the head above this water, he's seeing the other lion and he was shocked, frightened, restoring, of course, no problem, enough energy, enough power, enough control. It's always possible to go back. There's a one lake in the forest, but this water is a gloss. He's deciding to wait a little bit. She's deciding to wait a little bit. Maybe the other lioness is disappearing, she was thinking. Just resting, a moment later tying again, but as soon as the head is above the water, the other lioness is there again and she's getting angry, angry about herself, angry about the other lioness. She's starting to fight, showing her teeth, attacking, a terrible lion roaring. But, the other lioness is equally strong and it's fighting back, also showing terrible teeth. Next time, she was seeing a exhaustive lioness, somehow a little bit sad lioness, feeling somehow like blocked into body, exhaustive, sad, helpless, feeling how much energy this was costing. Of course, she always can go back, but this water is a glow and she is laying into shadow and suddenly one lion, from conscious mind, you thought that's not fitting to the situation. She suddenly has beautiful memories and kind of beautiful memories form very, very long time ago. She's a very, very young baby lion and hunting butterflies. She's remembering vividly. The time she really was many, many days hunting butterflies and never been successful. She was remembering, she never was catching one of this fast butterflies, but she was so happy. Looking back, she suddenly understood she was not hunting butterflies, she was learning some hunting techniques, estimating distances, jumping exactly to the right spot, attacking and flying through the air from the right side to the left side, rolling and again attacking, hiding in the grass and going very slowly closer and closer and exploding in a moment, lending from above and the feeling for a victim. Uh… butterflies always have been faster. Then she was always sure, "This time I will be successful". So was like a time, there was no falls, just learning and playing. Then she was opening her eyes and seeing the lake, blue, blue water, standing up and she was walking through the water and the body was moving somehow different. Because on one side, it's a very experienced adult lion, this also fighting experience, life experience and at the same time this little lion is hunting butterflies. So body was moving a little bit different. So the hips, the shoulders, she was a little bit, just a little bit feeling different in this combination, this also fighting experience from also life. And this memory of this young lion hunting butterflies and she was suddenly hearing a voice, it was her own inner voice, voice was coming almost like from outside. What's the matter with this lion? Do not care about lions. She was just walking to the water, puts her head into water, the water has ripples. She was drinking. Sometimes it seems as she, if she would see the half a lioness, but who's caring about other lion is just drinking and drinking, and then she's deciding to go back and she thought it's a very good idea to use this combination or it's a life experience or fighting experience. And this playfulness of this little lion at the same time onto way home and she was seeing so many things that's it. She everyday was seeing and not seeing, she was remembering every piece of grass as a little bit different, green, she was seeing so many things, she was, last time seen when she was a very, very young lioness and then she was, she was seeing fire place. She was, usually she's avoiding people as knowing fast sometimes such scientific concusses round and as a touristic pilgrim, they're hiring somebody and this man is telling this people, "Let's set a fire and no wild animal will come". But this lioness at the stay have this feeling of being uh… very experienced, old lion and a curious young lion at the same time. She just was in the dark was going to this fire place. And nobody was from this people have been seeing her. She just was hearing some conversations. And it was Psychotherapy congress instead of talking about psychotherapeutic strategies at this fire place. And one was telling he was traveling to China and have learned from the direct of Chi-Kong laboratorial from Beijing University, a very, very interesting technique. And everybody was very curious at this fire place to hear about this technique. And he said, "Yes." He said, "We should sit and you should look one meter in front of us and you should close your eyes. And he said, "Now you can imagine and this place is a big box. It can be a wooden box, it can be a metal box, it can be a piece of art or simple thing. But it should be big enough to put some important problems into it. So the box should be open and then you can put in a symbolized rate or in a real rate problems in it. When this man was teaching, it's an old Chinese technique if you want to meditate and if you temporarily want to get rid of things, to be able to meditate, you can use such things. And he now, learning from Western side of Southeast have modifying technique and two more psychotherapeutic technique. And we should put some things in it and then we should close the box and look for a long and closing it carefully and knowing there's a keys from this box. And logging relaxed on this box, everything is closed safely. And suddenly the box is on 3 meters surprisingly, take on 1 meter and then 5 and 10 and 3 meters, 30 meters. It looked different from the distance. 5 meters, 50 meters, 30, 70, 50, 100 meters. Definitely looks different from the distance 100 meter, 50 meter, 30 meter, 70, 20, 5, 10, 3, and back to 1. And taking this uh… key again off the lock and opens the box for a brief moment looking into it.

MILTON H. ERICKSON Shaking the situation and closing it again. And looking again, there's a box and the same as starting again 5meters, 3 meters, 5 meters, 10, 30, 20, 70, 50, 100, 50, 250, maybe we only knowing said it some welfare. Maybe you still can see it somehow, 100 meters, 500, 1 kilometer, 100 meters, 2 kilometers, 1, 5, 2, 10 kilometers, and we can just leave it there and the unconscious mind do some of the work and the lion decided to leave this bonfire and to go to his place, to his forest. At no place he feels more safe that at this place. Actually, he feels so safe that safety is not even a topic anymore. It's his place. Next morning, he was not remembering if he's laying so, he's laying for a long time, it's a short time or it was a short time or long time. And so, you can, in a short time which can be a long time finish or it's a start of business and let the unconscious mind do the rest of the work with all your life experience and therapeutic experience before you're counting from 1 to 20 and reorient yourself. 

00:46:35
[sil.] 

00:46:45
MILTON H. ERICKSON And you can feel your breathing more and more. The ventilation noise outside and from 1 to 20 the fingers are moving. 

00:47:05
[sil.] 

00:47:10
MILTON H. ERICKSON And so eyes can open slowly again. 

00:47:15
[sil.] 

00:47:20
MILTON H. ERICKSON And what do you think? How much time it was? What we did here? 

00:47:30
UNKNOWN I can't tell how much time. 

00:47:30
MILTON H. ERICKSON Do you have estimation? 

00:47:35
UNKNOWN I think it was lot longer than you feel. 

00:47:40
MILTON H. ERICKSON Mm-hmm! What is the feeling? How much it feels? 

00:47:45
UNKNOWN Maybe 10, that's how it feels. 

00:47:45
MILTON H. ERICKSON 10? 

00:47:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:47:45
MILTON H. ERICKSON That was a little bit longer. 

00:47:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, I know. 

00:47:50
MILTON H. ERICKSON Yeah, okay. Yeah. So, anything you would like to share briefly or reach us like it's, like it is? 

00:48:05
UNKNOWN Umm… it was very interesting. I think, I was, I, I felt, I was going deep and up and lighter and deeper and lighter. I think throughout umm… some of the time I had to have time following the story. 

00:48:25
MILTON H. ERICKSON Hmm. 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN Umm… I was well, that my eyes were moving as you're changing the distance. 

00:48:30
MILTON H. ERICKSON That's interesting, when I was, I was in this school when he was teaching us. And I thought, "Oh, have these Chinese people invented EMDR in this direction some 100 years ago?" 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN Yes. But, the thing is, it's very interesting, because Chinese words, they're vertical. 

00:48:50
MILTON H. ERICKSON Mm-hmm! 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN While your opinion worlds are horizontal. 

00:48:55
MILTON H. ERICKSON Yeah. 

00:48:55
UNKNOWN And we're doing here horizontally. So it would be interesting that they do it vertically. 

00:49:05
MILTON H. ERICKSON Yeah. I combined it in some mean time, some times I do as a box and do it all such things this way and I, say uh… I dint trust the book in China and ask me to make a chapter of his mind variations of this techniques they have been teaching me. Umm… and now usually, at this point, I tell the client he should exercise such things at home. Uh… at a time when the body is fresh, not when you're feeling tired, because you need to have a good concentration. Uh… you can exercise this at home four times, three times, two times, one time with eyes open, then closing and then you can again work uh… with this box technique and could put the heavy things into it, and can also experiment with other directions, moving the box in other directions and combine it with your own therapeutic approaches you're knowing. And umm… when you have been opening the box, was there change in it? It was one time when I said you should open the box briefly and shake. You have seen a change? 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN I didn't. 

00:50:20
MILTON H. ERICKSON You have not done at that view? 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN I'm… Yeah, so I'm so… I think… 

00:50:25
MILTON H. ERICKSON Yeah, okay. Sometimes, it's uh… some little changes, some big changes and the implications Somehow is, it's, after such brief time is such a change, work will be at the end. But this Chinese technique usually is not in it. Instead, instead, I did for you, it was a bonfire. 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, one other thing that was interesting is when you kept changing the distance, you know, my eyes would move, but then sometimes it was like, too much to move. You know, you just stand there. 

00:50:55
MILTON H. ERICKSON Okay, okay. 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN It was far behind the soften distance, it's kind of all the same… 

00:51:00
MILTON H. ERICKSON Okay. 

00:51:00
UNKNOWN …you know. 

00:51:05
MILTON H. ERICKSON Okay, that's all. 

00:51:10
UNKNOWN Thank you very much. I want to do this one too with my own trance and initially I like the blindness that help, helping my body, feel power umm… and I like to hear uh… the induction part of your own. What I have (inaudible ) I felt a little dizzy, once the uh… back and forth, I was with the box, trying to follow the back and forth, I, I felt in my body throughout my head, a little dizzy. So I don't know that, what that was? (inaudible ) It sound like a little too much of me. 

00:51:50
MILTON H. ERICKSON Yeah, it was umm… a lot of techniques at the same, at the same time now it was so… 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN Maybe my brain, too much for my brain, I'm not sure. But, it did change umm… I did have the box and I don't think then it did feel little different, but I don't know if that was an intentional, that was the back and forth would be uh… (inaudible ) I'm trying to do that. Is that common? 

00:52:15
MILTON H. ERICKSON Yeah, yeah. Same umm… I many times have seen such people, sometimes even after short times… the problem have disappeared or has changed or was more little or something was missing in it and so… it's very interesting that on a unconscious level. So it's a problem, problem solving going on. 

00:52:35
UNKNOWN But instead is that sense of dizziness, if you've heard that one… 

00:52:40
MILTON H. ERICKSON Yes, yes, yes. Of course, if you're doing really a intensive psychotherapeutic courses, you do not always feel relaxed after a hypnotic session. So… sometimes people have, have headaches or something. You know, especially after long (inaudible[00:52:58) when you're feeling a lot into your brain and suddenly you close your eyes on both sides, everything at the same time. 

00:53:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, one thing when people have headaches or dizziness when I do work usually, it's because they need water and minerals. If water doesn't do it, you should add some salt and usually they feel better. So you maybe dehydrated and you may need water or minerals. 

00:53:20
UNKNOWN I feel it's okay. It was just the visual in my, in my trance or going uh… of my going back and forth, you know, far and then come back it did help hard, it felt during that time little more dizzy… 

00:53:35
MILTON H. ERICKSON Now, it's, that's not too bigger. But, uh… generally in hypnotic psychotherapy sometimes people are not always feeling happy and relaxed and coming out refreshed, you know. So, okay, so… 

00:53:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, thank you.
