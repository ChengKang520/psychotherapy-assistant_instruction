00:00:20
JON CARLSON Welcome to Living Love. I'm Jon Carlson 

00:00:50
PAT LOVE And I'm Pat Love 

00:00:50
JON CARLSON In today's program is gonna be on keeping passion alive in you relationship. 

00:00:55
PAT LOVE You know, I don't think there's any more important subject for a relationship than passion. I hear it from men. I hear it from women. And today we're gonna look at how to keep it alive or maybe to recreate it again. 

00:01:05
JON CARLSON You know, it's really different for men and for women, too. I mean, passion is, I don't think it's the same thing for us. 

00:01:10
PAT LOVE I think we're gonna find out how to reach a man's heart, how to reach a woman's heart and maybe what the differences are. 

00:01:15
JON CARLSON First, we're gonna start with a quiz though and find out just where people are on the passion scale. 

00:01:20
PAT LOVE I'm a little worried about this passion quiz, to tell you the truth. But, that's okay. I'm open. I'm open. Then we're gonna have an inside listening ear to men's conversations and women's conversations. 

00:01:35
JON CARLSON We really do talk amongst ourselves. 

00:01:35
PAT LOVE Well, I'm gonna, I'll believe it when I hear it. Then we're gonna talk about what some of those barriers are to passion. And John Gray is gonna give us some activities that we can use. 

00:01:50
JON CARLSON Wow, I can't help, uh, but think that I need to really need to learn more about this subject, and I'm looking forward to John, who's worked with thousands and actually millions of people to give us the tips to how to break down the barriers between men and women in terms of passion. 

00:02:00
JON CARLSON Let's get started. 

00:02:05
PAT LOVE Okay. 

00:02:05
Keeping the Passion Alive 

00:02:05
JON CARLSON John Gray is the best selling author of "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus". He gives seminars across the country to couples. 

00:02:10
featuring John Gray, Ph.D., CFI 

00:02:10
PAT LOVE Well, it says, men, when, when it comes to sex and passion are like a blow torch. You turn it on, and then they go to sleep. Whereas for women, it's more like an oven, you have to preheat the oven, and it slowly... 

00:02:25
1 I am good at keeping passion alive in our relationship. 

00:02:25
JON CARLSON Before we go any further in the program, we'd like our studio audience as well as our audience, uh, at home to take a quiz. It's kind of a, a peek view. We're gonna determine what your, uh, passion quotient is by taking this test. And we have ten items for you, and they're true false. The first one is I am good at keeping the passion alive in our relationship. True or false. 

00:02:55
CONNIE A lot of them I wanted to answer sometimes, usually. I have a way, but I don't always do it, you know. 

00:03:00
2. I am clear about what is most important to my partner in our relationship. 

00:03:00
PAT LOVE Number two. I am clear about what is most important to my partner in our relationship. 

00:03:05
HANK Partner, and sometimes I'm not clear about what I'm thinking or feeling, and I, uh, I can't do it perfectly all the time, uh, towards my partner. So, the question about being clear, uh, and making, without any qualification, true or false was just difficult. 

00:03:25
3. At the end of the day, I feel appreciated by my partner. 

00:03:25
JON CARLSON Number three. At the end of the day, I feel appreciated by my partner. 

00:03:30
BEV So you have to just kind of assume he cares for you the whole day, basically. 

00:03:35
4. I can come to my partner with my troubles. 

00:03:35
PAT LOVE Well, well, it, it may be, yeah. I mean, it could be it starts out well in the morning, and by afternoon. Number four. I can come to my partner with my troubles. 

00:03:45
JOHN GRAY Men don't have a clue, women. You have to realize, he may love you, but he doesn't have a clue. Many times women think if I have to ask for what I want, then that means he doesn't love me. But it doesn't mean he doesn't love you. It means he's from Mars, he doesn't have a clue. He needs to be educated again and again, and then he forgets. If you accept a man, and you don't offer help, the beautiful thing is he starts asking more for help. 

00:04:10
5. My partner clearly understands me. 

00:04:10
JON CARLSON And I'm seeing a lot of smiles on our studio audience's faces as we're asking these questions. Number five. My partner clearly understands me. 

00:04:20
PAT LOVE Clearly, again. It's showing up again. Okay. 

00:04:25
CY I don't think she does, but in her mind, I think she does. 

00:04:30
PAT LOVE Important difference. Important difference. 

00:04:35
6. I know my partner trusts me 

00:04:35
JON CARLSON My partner believes she understands me. I think my passion quotient is taking, taking a beating here. 

00:04:40
PAT LOVE Is it dropping? Your PQ's dropping? Okay. Uh, number six. I know my partner trusts me. 

00:04:45
7. Each day my partner demonstrates caring. 

00:04:45
JON CARLSON Number seven. True, false. Each day my partner demonstrates caring. 

00:04:55
JOHN GRAY But, love outside the bedroom is actually for both men and women more important. About five to ten meaningful touches a day, nonsexual, will keep a woman very interested in you. 

00:05:10
8. I feel comfortable asking my partner for what I want. 

00:05:10
PAT LOVE I think my partner might do better on this than I. Okay, Number eight. I feel comfortable asking my partner for what I want. 

00:05:15
JOHN GRAY The women used to come in and always complain. My husband only touches me when he wants sex. All he wants is sex. And I used to think to myself, "What's wrong with that?" Then my wife started complaining the same thing, and I started looking into it and finding out what women need is, they need lots of affection without any sexual overtone. Uh, one of the simple ways to understand how passion grows in men is it starts south and goes north. 

00:05:40
9. I trust my partner will forgive me and not punish me when I make mistakes. 

00:05:40
JON CARLSON Number nine. This, this, number nine isn't easy for me. I trust my partner will forgive me and not punish me when I make mistakes. 

00:05:50
JOHN GRAY Women want sex just as much as men, but for women to feel their desire for sex, they first have more prerequisites. They need to be stimulated in their mind. They need to be heard. They need to be understood. They need opportunity to exercise the jaw muscles, to talk. They need conversation. They need to feel romanced. They need to feel special. They need affection. Then the energy starts moving down. When a woman feels loved, then she also wants sex just as much as a man. 

00:06:20
10. I have a way of keeping conflict from escalating. 

00:06:20
PAT LOVE And the last one. I have a way of keeping conflict from escalating. 

00:06:30
JON CARLSON Would you tell me what it is? 

00:06:30
PAT LOVE It's a secret. 

00:06:35
JON CARLSON This is the part of the program that I've been looking forward to, the opportunity to learn about passion from John Gray. John, what is passion, and are passion and sex, are they the same thing? 

00:06:50
JOHN GRAY Well, "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus" and definitely on Mars, passion is sex. It's the same thing. 

00:06:55
JON CARLSON That's what I thought. So maybe we should have... 

00:06:55
PAT LOVE That clears that up for you. 

00:06:55
JON CARLSON Works for me. 

00:06:55
John Gray Ph.D., CFI 

00:06:55
JOHN GRAY But, on Venus, passion is a much bigger word. Passion means a lot more. But for us men, what it means is that if there's passion, sex will last. You'll continue to be interested in your partner. She'll continue to be interested in you. But more importantly, when there's passion between a man and a woman, the relationship grows in many different ways, not just sexually. you continue to be interested in your partner. You know, so many couples lose the interest. 

00:07:20
JON CARLSON You know, somebody once told me that, that when you have sex and then you can just go home or you can go to bed, and you go to sleep. But, when you have passion, you know, you, you have sex and you stay there, and you stay involved. And you continue it. 

00:07:35
JOHN GRAY Well, and that's again a man's experience as he gets older. For a younger man, generally, he has sex, he goes right to sleep. I mean, it's true. And women shouldn't take that personally. But, if he's having sex, and this is a difference between men and women, for men when they're sexually attracted, when they're turned on sexually, when there's an opportunity for sex, that brings his energy up to his heart, and that's when he starts feeling his connection to his partner. That's when he can feel how much he loves her. That's when he can feel how much he needs her. That's when he can let in her love. That's why men hunger for sex so much. Is because to a certain extent, we go through the day armored. We're not in touch with our feelings. We're not in touch with our needs for intimacy and affection and kindness and compassion and warmth and, you know, we're in a competitive world. We're hardened by that. And not that women aren't out there too, but men have all this armor and they don't, they disconnect from their feeling self. They don't have the hormones like women have to stay in touch with feelings. But, it's through sex that many men open up to their feeling self. As he grows older, there's many other places where his feelings will come out, but sex is a doorway for a man. 

00:08:40
JON CARLSON So, passion really is very different depending on your sex, and very different depending upon your age. 

00:08:45
JOHN GRAY Absolutely. It changes with age too. But, let's look at passion for women, which, for, for men, as we just mentioned, it starts south, and it goes north. Okay. Then what happens, for women it starts north. It starts in the head, moves down to the jaws, they're talking and communicating interest, interesting conversation. You're showing interest in me. I'm showing interest in you. That stimulates a woman. Her passion's starting to grow. Then the energy moves down to her heart. She feels more affection, more warmth, more love, more romance . Then she become sexually ignited, and this is important for men to know, because many men are resentful because they think, "I'm the one who wants sex, and my wife doesn't want sex." And the truth is women want sex just as much as men. It's just that women have more requirements before they want it. See, men have hardly any requirements. They want it they go. But women need to slowly come down. So in a sense, men, when it come to sex and passion, are like a blowtorch. You turn it on, and then they go to sleep. Whereas for women, it's more like an oven. You have to preheat the oven, and it slowly builds the passion. 

00:09:50
JON CARLSON Does this work for you? I mean, this north/south thing? 

00:09:55
JON CARLSON Well, it, it really helped. You're really helping me in a lot of ways. One is I'm really hearing you say, see if I got this, that men and women basically want the same thing. They come at it from different directions. So, I mean, I'm still stuck back on the power of the statement you made that when a men has, a man has sex, it opens him to love. I mean, I have to tell you, John, that's a new thought. I mean, that's a wonderful vision that I had when you said that. And then I also had the vision that when a woman is talking. 

00:10:25
JON CARLSON I knew that. I knew that. 

00:10:25
PAT LOVE You knew that. When a woman is talking, it's not avoiding sex, it's like give me something to work with. I am moving in that direction. 

00:10:30
JOHN GRAY That's right. That brings her down to her heart so her heart can open, then she wants to have sex. 

00:10:35
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:10:35
JOHN GRAY It's like when a man travels, what you need is to talk to her on the phone a lot, so that she's getting her need to communicate, cuz when he gets home, quit often he just wants to have sex. And if you haven't talked, she's not interested. 

00:10:45
PAT LOVE It just doesn't work. Literally, I need this. 

00:10:50
John Gray Ph.D., CFI 

00:10:50
JOHN GRAY Yes, yes. And literally, now that's in the bedroom where men need the passion, where men need sex for passion. But, men also have other needs outside the bedroom, and it's really important we look outside the bedroom, because that's what really causes whether the passion lasts over a lifetime. 

00:11:05
PAT LOVE Like what are they for men? What do men need? 

00:11:05
JON CARLSON Okay, what are the needs for men. 

00:11:05
JOHN GRAY Men have emotional needs. Women have emotional needs. And, if a man understands what a woman's emotional needs are, then she con continue to be attracted to him, turned onto him. And when she's turned on to him, that keeps him turned on to her. That's another secret about how a man stays turned on to his wife. If she's not attracted to him, he'll lose attraction for her. 

00:11:25
PAT LOVE It's the one natural aphrodisiac, is a turned on partner. 

00:11:30
JOHN GRAY That's it. That's right. Particularly when women are turned on, they produce endorphins. No, I'm sorry, they produce pheromones. That's it. I'm sorry. They also produce endorphins, which cause them to become high and more loving and so forth, but they produce pheromones, which is a scent. Now, you can't detect it consciously, but it goes into a man's unconsciousness, and every man has an extra set of nose inside of this nose, two little flaps inside of his nose, and their one job is to detect, to detect a turned on woman. Cuz when he smells those pheromones, it's true. This is all scientific. When he smells the pheromones, he becomes aroused. So, one of the keys to keeping passion alive is for men to know what to do outside of the bedroom so his wife is interested in him, which keeps him interested in her. Plus there's other things she can do for him. But, let's first explore what she needs. 

00:12:20
JON CARLSON What are those things? I wanna take some notes here. 

00:12:20
Keeping Passion Alive There are three things women need: To be Cared For To be Understood To be Respected 

00:12:20
JOHN GRAY The things that a woman needs are three things, basically three things, three kinds of love. Everybody needs love, but it comes in different flavors. And these are the flavors that women need most to grow in passion. 

00:12:30
JON CARLSON And, and you're gonna let him know if he, he's got it right? 

00:12:35
PAT LOVE Okay. 

00:12:35
JOHN GRAY We're gonna talk about it. 

00:12:35
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:12:35
JOHN GRAY Okay. The first thing that women need most is to feel that a man cares, that a man shows that he cares. Now how, let's look at some ways I would show that I care. Let's say that the house is cold, and I'm thinking, "Well maybe it should be warm." Instead of just going and turning it up, I'll go check with my partner. I'll say, "Are you cold? Would you like me to turn up the heat?" And she feels like she's included. 

00:12:55
JON CARLSON I real, I would feel so cared for. 

00:12:55
JOHN GRAY See, it's a simple thing. 

00:13:00
PAT LOVE It's a simple thing. 

00:13:00
JON CARLSON You mean I have to, to ask her before I change the stations? 

00:13:00
JOHN GRAY You don't, no. 

00:13:05
PAT LOVE It would help. 

00:13:05
JOHN GRAY Here's another one. You want passion? If you want passion that night, and you're watching a movie with a woman, what you do is you realize they watch TV differently. At the commercial break, you put it on mute, and you turn to her and you talk about the show. 

00:13:15
JON CARLSON Oh, wow. 

00:13:15
PAT LOVE Ooh. There's a fresh idea right there. 

00:13:20
JOHN GRAY Then, when the show comes back on. Most men, as soon the commercials come on, they start channel surfing. 

00:13:25
JON CARLSON Oh, sure. 

00:13:25
JOHN GRAY You know, which is a woman's going, "Why are we changing relationships? We're in a movie here. Let's stay with the relationship." 

00:13:30
JON CARLSON To find out the score, you know? 

00:13:30
JOHN GRAY They wanna move around. Now, it doesn't mean a man can't channel surf, but that's what he's watching TV for him. But if it's gonna be an intimate experience, he needs to understand what she needs and care about her, consider, take her feelings into consideration. That's a way of saying I care. Another way of saying I care is empathy. If she's upset, instead of just standing there, what you do, guys, is you say, "Is there something I can do?" That's it. Don't offer a solution. Just say, is there something I can do? Quite often, that's all you need to do. 

00:14:05
PAT LOVE Listening is helping. 

00:14:05
JOHN GRAY Listening is the most important way to say I care. 

00:14:05
PAT LOVE It's so helpful. 

00:14:10
JOHN GRAY When she comes home from work, if she seems distressed, say to her, "How was your day?" Then, she might even say, "Fine." That doesn't mean end of conversation. You see, if you ask a man, "How was your day?" He says, "Fine." He means don't ask me any more questions. Fine. That's it. If you ask a woman, "Is something the matter?" And she says, "No." That means ask more questions. If she says her days was fine, you say, "What happened?" She wants you to sense that she's upset and troubled about something, and you care. The way you show your caring is to ask questions. Can you relate to that? 

00:14:40
PAT LOVE I love questions, yes. I love questions. 

00:14:45
JON CARLSON So, one way to, to increase passion then in a woman is caring. 

00:14:45
JOHN GRAY Caring, and showing your caring has a lot to do with asking questions. Now why do men not think. You say you love asking questions. 

00:14:55
PAT LOVE I love being asked questions. 

00:14:55
JOHN GRAY You love being asked question. 

00:14:55
PAT LOVE That's right. 

00:14:55
JOHN GRAY So, women, because they love being asked questions, make the mistake of asking men lots of questions. 

00:15:00
PAT LOVE And they don't like it. 

00:15:05
JOHN GRAY And we don't want questions. And the reason men don't ask questions is we don't want to encourage her to ask us questions. 

00:15:10
JON CARLSON That's good. He's right. 

00:15:10
JOHN GRAY So, the secret here is men, you ask her questions because that's what she needs. And women, understand men are from Mars; they don't want a lot of questions. If you ask a question and a man says fine, good, all right, that means don't ask him any more questions. And if I need your help I'll ask for it. But, so there's a little difference there. So, again, what do women need? Caring. The next thing women need is understanding. Understand a woman means to anticipate some of her needs, to anticipate what she wants, what she likes. For example, here's a way to say understand. You're reading a menu at a restaurant, and you say, "Oh, look, here's your favorite shrimp creole." She goes, "He remembers that I like shrimp creole." The evening is done, because he's like remembering something about her. So that's, that's one aspect of understanding. Another aspect of understanding is recognizing what are the things that bother her or upset her and show some consideration. For example, if I, if she was making me dinner, and I was late, I know that she wants me to give her a call, so I would give her a call, and a lot of men think, "Well, why should I stop and give a call. That will take more time, and then I'll be more late." It doesn't work that way, men. You show consideration and understanding that, hey, she doesn't know where you are. She doesn't know where when you're gonna be there. She's like when do I put it in, when do I not? What's gonna happen? Is it gonna get burned? Show a little understanding of what' she's going through and give her a call. Another way to show understanding again is to ask questions, to understand what she's going through. You have to know what she's going through. You have to ask questions. 

00:16:35
JON CARLSON So, these are in your formula? 

00:16:35
PAT LOVE They're, when you were first talking about understanding, we were going to hear Pavoratti. And one of my pet peeves, I have to admit it here, is being stuck in traffic. And, my husband, who knows all the back streets that were ever invented in Austin, Texas, we're in, we're in this long line, and I'm like, making up in my head we're not gonna see Pavoratti, right? He goes, I mean, and this is not his style because he's very patient, he's very calm. He knows that probably it won't, we won't get there any quicker, but he knows it'll make me feel better. 

00:17:10
JOHN GRAY Make her feel better. 

00:17:10
PAT LOVE And so, honey, we are driving down every back street. And I'm sure we didn't get there any sooner, but it made me feel better. He understood what that means to me, just sitting there, with looking like nothing's happening. 

00:17:20
JOHN GRAY Right, so he was doing something from a place of understanding, and that was, he was also doing the third need, which is respect. 

00:17:30
JON CARLSON What's the third need? Respect. 

00:17:30
JOHN GRAY Respecting. When, when you respect something, you actually make a sacrifice. You give up something for someone that you honor. And women need to feel that you're willing to give up something for them. Not all the time, but you've got to make your woman more important than your work, more important than your children. One way I honor my wife is, particularly when my children were young, I'd come home. They'd wanna come hug daddy, talk to daddy, and they're full of love. I'd say, "Where's mom?" And we'd go to mom first and I'd give mom a hug a first. That's respecting her. If she made me a dinner, and she said it's dinner time, I immediately get up and say, "I'm here." instead of going, "Well, I'm working on something. I'll be there a little later on. I don't care if the food gets cold." That's called not respecting. Honoring her is if she put all the time and energy into making a meal, and she says it's time to eat, I get in there. And not only does she feel honored, but the children learn to honor their mother as well. So many children don't listen to their mothers because dad listen doesn't listen to their mothers, cuz dad's, they don't respect. They have to learn how to respect a woman, which means to listen, to care, and then to do things. Put it into action and do things. Here's a way I would respect. Your story reminds me of a story. In that Mars and Venus quite often drive differently. And, in my situation, I, when I see a yellow light, I read go fast. When my wife sees a yellow light, she reads slow down and stop. So, we have different opinions on the whole thing, different experiences. She's more comfortable if I'm driving the car, and she's sitting in the seat, I honor her. I understand her need. I respect her. She's there. She's not in control of the car. So, if it's a yellow light, I slow down for her. If she's not in the car, it's a yellow light, I drive through it. Okay? So thre's no criticism. It's not like she's saying, "You should never go through a yellow light like that." But, when I'm in the car, let me honor her. She's my special guest, and that's what creates the passion and makes a woman feel special, another important ingredient of keeping passion alive. 

00:19:15
PAT LOVE So what... 

00:19:15
JON CARLSON Now listen. Let's say... 

00:19:15
PAT LOVE What about men? 

00:19:15
JON CARLSON It looks like he's three for three for women. Here's, here, why don't you take some notes here, and maybe he can... 

00:19:25
PAT LOVE Alright, I'll take notes. Okay. How, how can I create passion in my partner? 

00:19:25
Keeping Passion Alive There are three things men need To be Appreciated To be Accepted To be Trusted 

00:19:25
JOHN GRAY This is the whole secret with men, the fuel that keeps a man interested in a woman. Think about when men are interested in anything. Men are always interested where they're successful. See, if a man feels he can, if his team is successful, he's interested. If he can do something, he does it well, he's more interested. He's always focuses, focused in areas where he's successful. How do you know if you're successful? You get a message that says, I appreciate you. That's how you pull a man in, is to let a man know you appreciate him. You appreciate, you appreciate the little things he does. You acknowledge the little things he does. And women do appreciate men, but they just don't way it out loud, and quite often they think, "Why do I have to say it out loud? I don't need him to always say out loud I appreciate you did this, I appreciate you did that." But, men need it. And it's not like they're little boys. They're men. This is what men need, just as women need to share feelings a bit more than most men. Men need appreciation more than most women. 

00:20:15
JON CARLSON Okay, now let, let me get this, because I have to tell you there's a part of my brain that goes toward what he's not doing instead of what he's doing, so it's, so are you saying it's okay, I can appreciate you just for the small things, for the little things, and that would register? 

00:20:30
JON CARLSON Oh, boy. 

00:20:30
JOHN GRAY Yeah, and it registers for him, big time. 

00:20:35
JON CARLSON Oh, boy. Big time. 

00:20:35
JOHN GRAY Big time. It's just the little things that, even, and also when he says something, you can say, "That's a good idea." That's magic to a man's eyes, ears. That's a good idea. Or that was very helpful. You know, these are the things that make a man feel useful. Men need to feel useful, particularly today more than any time in history as women become more successful in the workplace, that can kill passion cuz a man feels like, "Well, what do I contribute to her life?" So, she, the truth is now we men have a new job description, we have to contribute on an emotional. We have to do little things that make her feel special, that's giving her those three things. She will appreciate you a lot. But, she needs to know to verbalize the appreciation. Acknowledge the little things that he does again and again and again. Now, let me give an example of how a woman loses her ability to appreciate. Let's say I'm dating my wife before we got married. I open the door for her. She walks through and there's a smile. And that smile says, "Oh, what a gentleman. Thank you so much. That's an appreciative smile. Seven years later, we're leaving the restaurant. I open the door, and there's another door, and a strange man walks up, a man we don't know. He opens the door. So, two men opening the door for her. What's her reaction? She looks to the stranger, and she goes, "Oh, thank you." Now what message do I get as the husband? 

00:21:50
John Gray Ph.D., CFI 

00:21:50
JON CARLSON Chopped liver. 

00:21:50
JOHN GRAY That's right. See, and where does that come from? What she's saying to him is, oh, you didn't have to open the door, and you did it anyway. My husband , he has to open the door. I do his laundry. This is how domestic routine kills the passion, is that women will say, "Well, he stopped doing the little things." But often, women stop appreciating the little things the man does, because they're doing so much for him, and they feel like it's even. Always appreciate the little things a little things a man does, as if he owes you nothing. Then a man will give more. That's the whole secret to getting men to give more, is to appreciate the little things he does. 

00:22:25
PAT LOVE You know what I'm loving about what you're saying is these are simple things. And they're easy. And they don't take any more time. People are always saying, "We don't have, we don't have any more time." It's just about how you're using your time. 

00:22:35
JOHN GRAY That's right. 

00:22:40
PAT LOVE You're using it smartly, wisely, lovingly. 

00:22:40
JOHN GRAY Efficiently. Exactly. 

00:22:40
JON CARLSON Let's, let's give Pat, uh, a couple more deceptively simple ideas. 

00:22:45
JOHN GRAY The first one is to appreciate men. Men are fueled by appreciation. The second one that men need is to feel accepted, that they don't have to be perfect. See, quite often men, men are like rubber bands in a sense. They get close, and then once they've gotten closer, they'll pull away, and they're distant and they're not charming and they're not interested, and they're kinda boring. And then, after they pull away for a while, they miss you, the woman, and then they come back and they're charming and interesting again. So, this kinda this on off quality of men. When a woman can accept that he's not gonna be loving and wonderful all the time. Like, basically, if my wife said to me, "John, you're the most loving, wonderful man 80 percent of the time, and a real jerk 20 percent of the time.", my reaction would be, "Okay." 

00:23:30
JON CARLSON Hey! Hey! 80 percent! 

00:23:30
JOHN GRAY Okay, you know. Easy. I like it. She can even say 60 percent of the time I'm wonderful, I go, "Okay, and she still loves me." It wouldn't work if I told her that. Well, honey, you're wonderful 60 percent of the time, but the rest of the time I'd rather go for a drive. That doesn't work for women, but for men it does. We need to just simply feel that we're, that we don't have to be improved. We don't have to be perfect. We don't have to do the right things. We have to feel that we can be forgiven. 

00:23:55
PAT LOVE So much for the simple part. 

00:23:55
JOHN GRAY It's hard, but here's the easy part of it. Just bite your tongue whenever you want to help a man, then he feels that you're accepting him the way he is. And when you're upset, don't express your negative feelings on him. Take time to journal them. We'll explore some techniques for letting go of negativity so that you can forgive him. Because when you forgive a man, it makes him wanna give you more. If you punish a man, it starts to kill the passion. So, the third thing. So we have appreciation. We have acceptance. And the third is trust. Men to feel trusted. What I mean by trusted is that you trust him to be a grown up. You trust him to figure out his own diet. You trust him to do things on his own, that you don't always have to be his mother, helping him. In a sense, women are like the , do you remember in high school, the hall monitors. Where are you going? What are you doing? What are you gonna do here? They like to monitor things. And that's their innocence, but when a woman is, like, what are you eating? What are you spending? How much are you doing here? Where are you going? A man starts to feel that he's being mothered, and she doesn't trust him to live his own life. 

00:24:55
PAT LOVE And how's he gonna be passionate with his mother? 

00:25:00
JON CARLSON His mother. 

00:25:00
JOHN GRAY Right. That's what kills the passion. 

00:25:00
PAT LOVE Oh, wow. Okay. 

00:25:00
JON CARLSON So, if I've got this right, we've got men need appreciation, acceptance, trust, and women need respect, need to be understood, and need to be cared for. 

00:25:10
JOHN GRAY Right. When you're doing things outside the bedroom, demonstrate those messages. 

00:25:15
JON CARLSON And then this is gonna help create passion in the relationship. And, you know, many couples tell, in my experience is, that I have passion, I thought. When, you know, my relationship began, and then somewhere I lost it. This program's gonna be about how to get it back. How does that happen? I mean, how, how, what is it? 

00:25:35
JOHN GRAY What happens is we lose the passion when we start realizing that we're not gonna get what we need. See, the women start feeling like, well he's not doing what I need. He's not doing what I need, but I thought he loved me. If he loved me he would do the things I need. That's why we have to be educated as to what each other needs, and also particularly women and men, have to learn to ask for what they want instead of just. 

00:25:55
PAT LOVE Oh, that's so hard for women. 

00:25:55
JOHN GRAY Yeah, it's very hard for women. It's like, like on Venus they just assume if you love someone, you've got little antennas, and you know what they want. 

00:26:00
PAT LOVE Plus it changes over years. I realize that it changes. What I need now is different from what I needed in the beginning. 

00:26:05
JOHN GRAY It's always changing. That's why we have to have good communication, and we have to be able to ask for what we want. And even if you ask once, you have to realize women, a man will tend to forget, because it's very foreign to him. He can't understand why certain things are so important to you if they're not important to him. One thing that's very important to women their whole lives, that men should know, is that for women to feel passionate, they need a hormone called oxytocin to increase in their body. And that oxytocin increases when a man does little things to say your special, particularly affection. When he touches her in a nonsexual way, oxytocin starts getting generated. Throughout the day, slowly it builds and builds and builds, and then she can feel more loving to him. If she doesn't get the stimulation, no matter how much she loves him, she doesn't feel it. So, what we have to do is actually do things that nurture each other's needs to stimulate the hormones that create passion. But here's something about passion that most people don't understand. Never in history has passion been a part of marriage. Historically, passion has always gone away after three years. It's as if your body gives you three years of automatic passion, and then after it goes away unless you learn, during those three years, or you learn whenever, how to generate passion. See, in the beginning, you don't have to know anything. All you have to do is touch, and passion happens. But, ten years later, you can't just touch if you're too familiar. But, what you do is you create circumstances, situations for that passion to increase by conversation, dialogue, affection, occasional romantic getaways. These are the things that create a context for that same passion to come up, but it's even stronger because it's also heartfelt. You know the person. It's not just a stranger you're passion, attracted to. It's someone you adore, someone that you've seen the best of and the worst of. And you still have passion. That is real passion, and that can only achieved after many, many years. 

00:28:00
John Gray Ph.D., CFI 

00:28:00
JON CARLSON Well, before we go on in our program, and learn just how to get that passion back into our lives, let's have some questions from our studio audience on the material we've just talked about. 

00:28:10
CY I'm kinda curious. You briefly touched on the subject that passion changes as you get older. I mean, does it get better? Does it get worse? Could you, I mean, tell me a little bit more. 

00:28:20
JOHN GRAY That's a great question, and, uh, for most people it gets worse, without a doubt, because they haven't been taught the skills of creating passion. If we just do what our parents did, which most of us learned how to have relationships from our parents. We don't learn those skills, so we've just explored the, the basic emotional needs that are required to fulfill each other so that the passion can continue. Even with that, passion changes. And what happens is as men move over 40, between 40 and 50, a shift takes place. Sometimes 48, sometimes 45, sometimes even 40, where the testosterone level naturally starts to drop. This doesn't mean he can't have great sex. It doesn't mean he's not interested in sex, but what it means is that he doesn't know when he's ready to have sex. You see, for 25 years, men only have sex when the salute comes up, okay. They know it. Clearly, everything in their body says, "I'm ready. Let's do it now." And so it's an instant kind of reaction. The thought of sex, and there's something. Over 40, a man's whole body could be ready to have sex, but there's no salute. What happens? So, he doesn't know that he can have sex, so he thinks he's not interested in sex. So, his wife says, "You wanna have sex?" His response is, "Nope. I'm tired." And, and because he doesn't think it's gonna work tonight, he gets really, really tired. And so that becomes a pattern where she starts wanting more sex, he's really tired because he doesn't know that another way of having sex, which is the way women have been having sex for 20 years, which is when a woman starts out having sex, she doesn't know whether she's gonna be turned on or not. It's kinda like a guessing game. Maybe tonight, maybe not. We'll see. She doesn't have a problem with he doesn't know. She doesn't have a problem if he's not into it either. But men think we have to always be into it. So, the secret over 40 is instead of starting the way you used to, you start with just massaging each other. She just touches him. She massages him all around. And after 5, 10, 15 minutes that she's massaged closer and gets more to the genital area and so forth, something starts to happen. If nothing happens, she doesn't mind. And so what you do is you have regular massage times. You'll lie together naked. You kiss a little bit, and you massage. And what he discovers is a whole new level of sexuality because when the hormones start to balance out more, he can last longer, he can enjoy much bigger passion, but it takes longer to build up. But, literally, most men stop being interested in sex around 42, and more interested in golf because they don't realize that they could have the sexual experience. And they're not about to start out having sex and have nothing work, because it would be a sense of failure. So, it's an important insight for men to have, that their whole feeling around sex will change over 40, and for women quite often, their libido increases right around age 37. That's when women start complaining they're not getting enough sex. So, for the younger man, you've got a lot to look forward to. 

00:31:10
JON CARLSON So, if you had stock in golf courses, and the people are listening to this, you'd better sell, sell, sell. So, other comments or questions that you might have. 

00:31:15
BRET My wife just asked me if I have my pager on, on vibrate. And I said, "Sure, I do." And I winked at her. It's always, I told her it's always on vibrate, and I winked at her. And I'm always turning questions around and giving her sexual, uh... 

00:31:35
JOHN GRAY Innuendos 

00:31:35
BRET ...innuendos. I'm always turning it around. It's always sexual, and she's always, now we're to the point where she's even kidding me about it. Everything's sexual to you. Everything's sexual to you. Is that okay for me, or am I giving, or is it too much for me? 

00:31:50
JOHN GRAY It's too much to be doing, and I'm sure she's told you that. If you're all the time giving that message, then they feel like all they are to you is a sex object, and then they're not, they're not, uh, feeling who they are is loved. So, a certain amount of that's very important at the right time. It's all about timing. Not too much. 

00:32:05
PAT LOVE Don't use your bullets till you got a target. 

00:32:10
JOHN GRAY I second that. 

00:32:15
Exercise 1 Venting 

00:32:15
JON CARLSON On that note, what we need to do is to move on to our next and our first activity, actually, where John is gonna teach you about venting and about how to become more in touch with your feelings. 

00:32:30
JOHN GRAY Yeah. More in touch with your positive feelings. Uh, there's been a kind of a missed message that psychology has given to people, which has really been responsible , uh, for a lot of problems, which is, if you're upset, you should tell your partner. And, when you're upset and you tell your partner, what's your experience? Usually escalates into something worse. And yet, we still have this notion that if we're upset, our partner should hear us, and we have to tell them, because quite often when we're upset, there is an urgency inside of us that we need to be heard. But, it's pointless to share what you're feeling with somebody who can't hear you. And we shouldn't expect our partner to hear us if what we're saying is something's wrong with our partner. You know, our partner will listen to us if we say loving things to them and we're opening our heart to them. But, if we're feeling anger, we're feeling frustration, disappointment, anxiety, uh, fear, worries, all the negativity that comes up, we need to have an outlet for it. 

00:33:20
JON CARLSON I gotta say it to somebody, you know. 

00:33:25
JOHN GRAY You gotta say it. That's called venting. You say it to somebody where you don't have to care what the person's gonna think, cuz that person's not the person you're talking about. The ideal place to vent, vent is just you put it out there without editing, without considering. Cuz see, if I'm feeling upset, and I'm talking to my wife, I have to all the time be thinking, "What is she feeling? I don't want to hurt her." and then I'm not really getting it out. But sometimes we just need to say it freely, without consideration so we know what's going on inside. Then we make sense of it. That's the real value of therapy. That's why people go to counselors is that you can say anything to the counselor. He's not married to you, so he doesn't get upset. He doesn't have to live with you, so he doesn't get upset. He sees you once a month and you pay him, or once a week. So, it's a whole different relationship. And many times, women expect their husbands to be like their counselor. I mean, a husband can't be that. He sees you all the time, and when you're upset, you're upset with him. When you're upset with the counselor, you're not upset with the counselor, you're telling the counselor how awful your husband is. So, it's, he gets, of course he can listen to that. So, it's, it can be very confusing. We get the idea that we're supposed to share all these negative feelings with our partner. It's not healthy. It's not productive. But, it is healthy, very healthy to talk about it. If we can talk about what's bothering us with a sympathetic person, then we end up feeling more positive. Then we can go back to the relationship and in a positive, from a positive point of view, more understanding, more forgiving, more accepting, more appreciative, all those different needs we talked about. Being able to give your partner what they need, then ask for what you want. Focus on specific behavioral changes after you've shared your feelings with somebody else. So, you're feeling positive. It never works to share negative emotions to change your partner. Like, "Oh, you hurt me. I want you to change." He won't change, or the man gets angry. Don't talk to me that way. She won't change. When we use negative emotions to change somebody, it just fixes them in that behavior again and again. It doesn't work. What works is love. That's why therapy works. Therapy helps people to let go of the negative emotion, then to ask what you want. The change takes place. So, what we're gonna learn is a technique. The best, one of the best places to vent for men, for example, is with other men. Like, I have a support group of men I meet with on a regular basis. But we just complain about our wives. Basically, that's it. You're with a group of people. You get to talk about the things that are bothering you that you can't say directly t your wife, cuz if you say it directly to your wife, you know what's gonna happen. For every complaint you have, she's got ten. And now you've got a big discussion, it escalates. 

00:35:50
JON CARLSON And she has a memory. 

00:35:50
JOHN GRAY And she remembers everything. Everything. And the other place for women, is to have their support, which is other women, where they have a chance to vent what they're feeling. Now, when you vent there's a process of venting to always come back to, and you're doing it in the context of knowing this is my negativity. You don't own it like, this is all, the only perception. It's like you have a glass is half full, half empty. When you're venting, you're just looking at the half empty part. Then what you do is you always end by looking at some of the positive side. And you only really wanna vent with people who realize, like my friends all know I love my wife very much and so forth. Then I can share my feelings. I don't want to share my feelings with somebody who's saying, "Yeah, dump, dump her. " you know, and "Get rid of her. She's no good." That's not the support I want. I just want people who will know I'm just temporarily stuck in my negativity. I need to talk about it, and I come back to my positivity. And that's venting. The two things is being able to express yourself freely, and two to people who know that this isn't the real me. This is just the confused me, the negative part of me, that I just need to, it's like a bunch of confusion. If you get it out, then you become clear. 

00:36:55
PAT LOVE Well, it's almost like what, what I'm aware of now is the negative. Knowing that if I express that, I'll get to the positive. What I'm aware of right now is the negative, so if I say this, I can get to what's underneath it. 

00:37:10
JON CARLSON Why, why don't we take time now, and set the, the guys up together, and the girls up together. And let's see how this works. 

00:37:15
JOHN GRAY Okay, let's do that. 

00:37:15
Exercise 1 Venting 

00:37:15
JON CARLSON For our viewers, it'll be necessary to find a group of peers to do this activity with. What we'd like to suggest that you do though, is watch carefully how our group answers the questions and use them as a model for doing this at home. 

00:37:35
JOHN GRAY So, what we'll be doing in a group of all men is focusing on what our primary needs are and what we're not getting. And, you know, when guys talk, they don't always get to the point of what's really not working, because quite often we think what's the point of it? The point of it is to any negativity we have does get released. Two, as you hear each other speak, you're gonna start becoming aware of complaints that you have inside. Probably you've noticed sometimes when your wife is complaining to you, that as soon as she says three complaints, you start to remember. Yeah, you've got there complaints? I've got five. Can you relate to that? It just starts popping up. So, it's like it sits inside of us, and we act like it's not there as long as things are fine. We're cool. Everything's fine. But if she starts complaining, our complaints come up. So they really do live inside of us, and this is an opportunity to get it out, and it does it in a very focused way. It's just simply to look at. First we're gonna do three, three different topics. The first is when I don't feel appreciated. 

00:38:35
Vnting Men Complete the following sentence "In my relationship, I don't feel appreciated when. . ." 

00:38:35
HANK I, I was thinking about appreciation,uh, from the standpoint of being out of town a few days. Uh, I was at a workshop and then I made sure I picked up a small gift for, uh, our four kids and, uh, for Connie, my wife. And, uh, I didn't have my keys on me. I'd called and let everyone know when I was gonna be coming home. I pulled up in the driveway, and I couldn't get in the house. Nobody was home. I got all these packages with me, and it was a real letdown. I hadn't been home for a few days, and there was nobody there to great me. Nothing. 

00:39:05
JOHN GRAY Beautiful. Thank you. 

00:39:05
CY Just the other night, my wife always accuses me of working too many hours, not spending enough time, so I came up with this idea. The local mall had a dinosaur exhibit. So, I called her up, and says, "Hey, why don't you have the kids ready. When I come home, we'll go out and see the dinosaurs. Stop and have a sandwich." You know, nice quick evening. Spend some time with them. I come home. Nobody's ready. Kids are out playing, and we ended up going like two and a half hours after I had gotten home. Spent another two hours at the exhibit, which was nice, but shot the entire evening. Nobody said thank you. Not one person said thank you. 

00:39:40
BRET Um, I could tell you I don't feel appreciated when, uh, my wife gives me a hard time about helping out in the house, keeping the house clean. So, she's out. I dust, which I never do. I dust and then vacuum, cuz you're supposed to dust first. Dust, vacuum, do the dishes, and she comes home and realizes everything is done, but never gives me a thanks, but gives me a, "Well, it's your house, too. You should be cleaning it too." That was nice. 

00:40:10
FRANK Brings to mind a couple days ago, uh, my wife was doing this project, and a phone call comes. And it's her friend. She wants to talk. And, I said, I'll talk to her and keep her busy, you know. You can finish. And, okay, did that. Then the same person calls back. I did it again. Three times I did it. And then I come back up, and I said, "Well, you , you know, how you doing?" She said, "Don't bother me." So, I, I was just like, kind of, why did I bother?" 

00:40:45
JOHN GRAY Right. 

00:40:50
JULIUS Well, I can remember an incident that, um, I felt most under appreciated when I, I did the grass. Well, first I got organized, and picked up my clothes, because I'm kinda sloppy. So I picked up my clothes and, uh, I run outside, and I cut the grass. And that's about a three hour job. I'm just laboring in the sun. And, uh, so I come back in the house when I'm through with the grass, and I sweep and I mop the floor. So I felt that I deserved a break, and I sit on the couch, and got the old remote and turned the TV on. And about that time she comes in. I mean, just like clockwork. And "Is this all you have to do with your day?" 

00:41:25
HANK Ouch. Another time I was thinking, uh, when I work a long day, um, sometimes I'll skip lunch, and, uh, it really is, uh, hard for me to come home after, uh, a long day and maybe not have any kind of food available. Um, I just, it's hard for me to feel welcomed at home or appreciated after, uh, putting up with a lot of the day to day in the, in the workplace. And, I don't know, when I come home, and I'm hungry, I, was hoped and joined everybody for dinner, and sometimes it's not always ready. 

00:42:05
CY I'm, I'm right there with you. Right there with you, but mine's not so much food. Mine is peace and quiet. I work hard all day, noisy atmosphere dealing with people, machines. I like to come home and have a quiet cup of coffee. But it seems like when I'm coming home, kids are coming home from school too. And it's utter chaos. Ruckus. There, there's , there's no quiet and it's like, "Hey, I've just worked eight hours, sometimes twelve hours. A little quiet, please. I mean, relax." Don't get it. 

00:42:30
BRET Uh, I gave, uh, I told my wife, why don't, I said, "Why don't you take the credit card and go out shopping one day on a Saturday, and I'll take care of the kids." And, um. 

00:42:40
JULIUS You did? 

00:42:40
BRET I still can't believe I did that. But, uh, who knows what's, God only knows what she spent, but, uh, she came back and was happy as heck that she got her clothes bought and her shoes and whatever else she needed, but I never got a thanks for letting me go, and, and taking care of the kids for me. That's all I wanted to hear was just, "Hey, ". No, I could care less if she spent a thousand, I woulda just liked to have heard, "Thanks for watching the kids for me." That's it. That's all I woulda needed. 

00:43:10
Venting Men Complete the following sentence "In my relationship I don't feel accepted when . . ." 

00:43:10
JOHN GRAY All right, let's move on to the next subject, which is a time when you didn't feel accepted. So, that could be, uh, where she's trying to change you. She's being critical of you. Uh, who you are isn't good enough. Um, maybe, like, you don't wanna talk, so then she wants to talk. Whatever it is where you feel like, I can't breathe and be myself in this relationship. That's, that's what I mean by not feeling accepted the way you are. It's like, hey, you're okay. 

00:43:40
HANK Uh, I remember one time we were in a really, uh, an emotional interaction, and I just wanted to go sit on the porch for a while, and she barred the door . And I said, "Look, I wanna get out of here, and I wanna get some air. I wanna, either I'm going through the door or I'm going through the window, but I'm going out to the porch." And, uh, she had this notion that if I was gonna leave, I might not come back. And, uh, it was a real challenge to get out that door. Uh, I had to, you know, I ended up promising to come back, but, uh, she just didn't seem to grasp that I would really benefit from catching a, catching my breath and getting my thoughts together. 

00:44:15
CY Again, like Hank, uh, sometimes I'm either not feeling good about myself or just a bad day, and I just don't want to talk. I don't wanna sit around and B.S. all day. She asked me how work went. Okay. And I just want to shut the conversation down there, but she'll keep asking questions and nagging me. And finally, I have to just get up and walk out of the room. Uh, she, she doesn't respect me or respect my privacy sometimes, I guess is what I'm trying to say. 

00:44:45
BRET Every Sunday morning I get up, and I like to go to the store to go get a paper and a cup of coffee. And she'll laugh at me every Sunday morning, going, "What is wrong with you? What you have? You have to leave, don't you. See you later. See you later." You gotta leave. So, I'm like, I look at her, and I go, "Yeah, I gotta leave." So, that's, that's one example. 

00:45:10
JOHN GRAY Good example. 

00:45:10
FRANK Yeah, well, I, you know, I don't want to call it nagging or something, but, um, sometimes I just have to go outside or not outside. I just, I would like to sit down and, um, smoke my pipe, and "Do you have to do that?" Well, it's something I like to do, you know. And, uh, it, it I wish it could say it only happens once, but it's more like a constant, every time. 

00:45:45
JULIUS I, I can remember this time that, uh, my wife doesn't really like the way I dress. She's, she doesn't think I'm a fashion plate. And I like the way I dress. I like colors. I like plaids, and , well, this one Sunday I was getting ready to go to church. And I had bought this new coat and a pair of slacks and waistcoat(ph), and I walked in the closet, and I came out. And I got dressed, and she walks back in the room. She says, "Oh, you're gonna sell used cars today." Kinda took the flavor out of the whole dress. 

00:46:15
CY For the most part, my wife does accept everything I do, except my stance on discipline. I'm a very black and white person. It's either right or it's wrong. And that's the stand I take, and that's the way I discipline kids. I don't see the gray, and she doesn't accept me for not seeing gray. Uh, we get in a lot of discussions about that, about the way, my stance on discipline. She doesn't accept me for that. 

00:46:40
BRET Yeah, my wife's not too, she's more on the relaxed side. I'm more on the strict side, and that's just the way I was brought up, and I'd rather have my kid be brought up that way instead of some. I'm a teacher and a dean now, so I'd rather my kids be brought up, I think, in a little bit more stricter environment than running around like a bunch of maniacs. And also at the dinner table I like to sing. I'll have the radio on while, uh, while we eat dinner. I like to have music on when we eat dinner. Sometimes I sing while we eat. And then she'll say, "Do you have to sing?" And I'll say, "Yeah, I have to sing." So, it's just another thing that bothers me. 

00:47:15
CY Good thing you're not eating at my house. No singing at the table. 

00:47:20
BRET Singing at your table. I mean I enjoy singing, and it's, for some reason that bothers her. I mean, we've been married now since '92, dated since '86. You'd think she'd understand that I like to sing or, or even if I'm just singing to myself. So. 

00:47:35
Venting Men Complete the following sentence "In my relationship, I don't feel trusted when..." 

00:47:35
JOHN GRAY And what, we'll go onto the third share, which is, uh, recalling an incident where you didn't feel trusted. And, it's, it's not necessarily, it's like, uh, I don't trust you, like, with another woman. Not that kind of trust, but I just don't trust you to like pay the bills right or handle the kids right or, or to put your, put your clothes together the right way. Just that sense that she's trying to fix you or improve you in some way instead of just letting you, you know, own your power as a man to, to make your own decisions and to make mistakes and learn from your mistakes. You know, that's what we need as men, and sometimes women don't get that. They wanna always like prevent us from making mistakes, like a mother would try to protect her child, so. A time you didn't feel trusted. 

00:48:20
BRET Uh, my wife went, uh, to go to the grocery store or something and whatever afternoon, and she comes up and gives my three year old a hug goodbye, and gives the 11 month old, picks her up out of the high chair, gives her a hug and a kiss. Sets her back down. She's like, "Take care of my babies." And she's walking out. I'm like, ready to tell her to "F" off, you know what I mean? Like I can't do, like I can't take care of my own kids. I need her to tell me to take care of, you know what I mean? Like, I don't know, like I'm clueless. So, we've yet to have a talk about that, but that's gonna come up real soon. 

00:49:00
JULIUS Oh, you will. 

00:49:00
BRET Is this, this conversation just reminded me that I need to talk to her about that. 

00:49:05
JOHN GRAY That's the old phrase of, I don't need you to tell me that, you know, when they tell you 

00:49:15
BRET There's no reason. There is no reason for her to look at me and say take, even if she's just saying it to be nice. To me it's underlying to where you can't do as good as a job as I could if I was here. So, make sure you take care of my kids. That's, that's the feeling I get when she walks out. And, you know, she's like, see you later, you know. Like, yeah, see you later. Wave to her. Get out of here. So, that's my trust example. 

00:49:40
JOHN GRAY Good one. 

00:49:40
FRANK Well, I don't have one as good as that, but it's, uh, she was running around all freaked out. She had a lot to do, and I said, "Well, what have you got to do?" "I gotta go to the library. I gotta go to the post office and do this. And I gotta go do." I says, "Okay. I'll go to the library for you, drop your books of for you, and I'll mail the letter." "All right. You'll do that for me?" "Sure." And then, sort of five minutes later, "Now, you're gonna do this, right?" 

00:50:15
JOHN GRAY That's a good example. 

00:50:15
FRANK Yeah, I am, you know. Just go. And then, I'm watching TV, so she must assume I'm going to forget, cuz like five minutes later it's like, "Now you're really, really go, you know, give me those letters. I, I'll do it." And I said, "No. Go." you know, I had to get to that point where I, you know, just go out, do your thing, and I guarantee. 

00:50:40
CY So, you insisted. 

00:50:40
JULIUS My wife does not trust me with the wash. Um, I was by the washing machine, and she came over, and she says, "What are you doing?" Yeah, I said, "No, I'm getting ready to wash." She says, "Are my clothes in there?" I said, "Yeah. She says, "Do you know what fabrics to put together." I said, "No." "Do you know what setting to put the machine on?" I said, she says, "Don't touch my clothes." And I felt like she did not trust me to do the wash. I mean it was a serious issue with her that I was not to do her wash. And so, after she got through grilling me and schooling me, I'm scared to even put clothes in the laundry hamper now. Uh, she was serious about that. I, I felt like she didn't trust me. I said, "How hard can this be, doing the wash?" Wait till she leaves on Monday. I'm gonna do it, but, uh, it's a small thing, but it's something. 

00:51:40
JOHN GRAY Yeah, it's looking at those little things. I think we should, we can finish up by just now focusing a little on the positive, which is when you did feel appreciated. We'll go around and do one for a time you did feel appreciated. We'll go through a time you felt accepted, a time you felt trusted. 

00:51:50
HANK Well, there's a lot of times I come home, um, my kids are genuinely glad to see me. Uh, I greet them and hug them and catch up with Connie and, uh, give her a hug and a kiss, and, uh, I don't know, I just, it's a good, uh, way to come home . And, I'm appreciative of my wife and kids and the family we form. So, that, it's like that a lot. 

00:52:15
CY When we came back from Florida, I flew down so I could drive them all back, and after driving for like twelve hours, I let my wife drive, and I was gonna try to sack out for a few minutes and get some sleep. And, uh, she actually had the kids keep quiet in the back of the car so I could sleep. I really appreciated that. It shows that she appreciated me taking the time , and, you know, to drive. 

00:52:45
FRANK Uh, every day we get up, I, I pour my kids, myself, my wife a glass of juice. And, uh, orange juice. She likes orange juice, so usually every other day, for breakfast, usually every other day she'll walk by and kiss me and say thanks for the juice. So, letting me know she appreciates it while she's getting, maybe the kids fed or the kids dressed. 

00:53:10
JOHN GRAY It really makes a big difference, doesn't it. 

00:53:10
BRET Right. Just a thanks. I mean, she, I don't, she don't even have to kiss me if she just looks at me and says, "Hey, thanks for the juice." Whatever. It's fine. 

00:53:15
JOHN GRAY Yeah. Just that it doesn't go unnoticed. A little bit of acknowledgment. 

00:53:20
BRET Right. 

00:53:20
FRANK Well, um, generally after she has the conversation with her father, she'll, uh, get off the phone and say, um, I need a hug or something, you know. And, just and then I'll give it to her, and she'll, later on she'll go, "Thanks for being there for me." 

00:53:45
JOHN GRAY That's an important one. 

00:53:45
JULIUS I, I remember time that, uh, my son was having a dilemma, and, uh, our son was having a dilemma, and uh, I was giving him some advice, and she overheard the advice that I was giving him. And after it was all said and done, she came out of the room and kinda tapped me on the butt and says, "Way to go, buddy. You did a good job." 

00:54:05
JOHN GRAY Isn't that great? That is great. That is good. 

00:54:10
JULIUS Made me feel, I knew she was joking, but I think she was serious too, so I felt good about that. Yeah. 

00:54:15
JOHN GRAY You know, as good as it feels for them to appreciate in these examples, it feels good to women a day later to come back and say, "You know, when you said that to me the other day, it really made my day." Cuz they don't know how these little things make such a big difference, just like we don't know the little things make a difference. They don't realize that occasionally when they do it right, it really has a big impact. Quite often I'll tell my wife something like that a day later, "You know, you said that thing to me the other day. It really made me feel good." She'll go, "Wow, I had no idea." And that is feedback that's really important for them. Well, I think this has been, any questions? You wanna just take a moment to share any experience in doing this exercise, just what you felt doing it? 

00:54:55
BRET I have a comment. 

00:55:00
JOHN GRAY Yes. 

00:55:00
BRET Don't tell my wife anything that I said. All right? 

00:55:05
JOHN GRAY That's why you do it with your male buddies. 

00:55:05
BRET I just wanna make sure this is a guy thing. 

00:55:15
[sil.] 

00:55:15
Venting Female Complete the following sentence "In my relationship, I don't feel respected when . . ." 

00:55:15
JOHN GRAY So, first we'll begin by exploring a time or incident, a memory when you didn't feel fully respected. You weren't seen or heard or honored in some way that you would have liked to have been. Would you begin? 

00:55:25
KIM Um, sure. Well, generally I think, Cy does respect me, and, um, but there was an incident recently where, um, he gets real mad about the adolescent children, the way that they talk to me. He says it's not respectful, but then if I sit there and try to talk to him about it, he's like, "Well, shut up now, I'm talking." You know, which is talking to me the same way that they do, instead of , you know, instead of being, uh, role model about how to talk to me, he'll sit there and, um, do the same as he's accusing my son of doing. And that's frustrating. 

00:56:05
BEV Um, I think for me it would be, um, just not having his attention. Um, he gets like, he plays video games or he does just other things. And sometimes I feel like he is trying to just tune me out really, you know, and he, um, he gets mad if I interrupt him cuz he's on certain levels. He's like a little kid, you know. And, uh, he's trying to get to this higher level and, um, he just starts snapping, and I kinda take it personally, you know. Um, so, I, I kinda feel like he doesn't respect me like because of that. Like, he's just, I'm not in the room, you know. And even when I'm in the room, he just keeps on, you know, playing. 

00:56:45
ARLIS My husband's very opinionated. He feels very strongly. He has this real strong male ego. Men this and men that. And a lot of times when things happen, he feels that his way is the right way, and he has a very difficult time understanding another perspective. And, so, I'll take an example where my son had locked his , a recent example, where my son had locked his car, his keys into his car. And so he needed to drive our car to go get his keys. Well, unfortunately, we just bought a new car. And you know how a man is about their new car, and I felt very, very uncomfortable allowing my son to use his car. But, I thought, I'm a grown woman. I'm, you know, paying half this note, I should be able to do this. And, as I suspected, he was very upset and couldn't figure out why he couldn't wait two hours till I got of of work and so forth and so on. So, I guess at that point I felt disrespected because I thought, "You know, why don't you just give me a car that I don't have to worry about any of that. Let me drive the older car." I mean, he wanted me to drive the new car. He likes for me to drive the new car. But, if I have to go through all these hassles, I'd rather just have the older car, so if I need to do something I don't have to worry. I'm just nervous driving the car because if it gets a scratch or whatever, you feel uncomfortable. So, that's, that would be a time when I think I felt disrespected. You know, I, I'm grown and I should be able to take care of our new car, so. 

00:58:15
CONNIE It's, it's like you don't have a brain. 

00:58:20
ARLIS Yeah. 

00:58:20
CONNIE And, and I guess the example I"m thinking of, just happened maybe yesterday or the day before. It was one of the hotter days this week, and my son had invited some friends over, and I thought, okay, well, you know, it was kinda hot in the house. We don't put our air conditioning on, which, but it thought, "Okay, I'm gonna close all the windows and put the air conditioning on." So, I put the air conditioning on, but then I wanted to fry up some potatoes. And frying the potatoes heated the kitchen, so Hank comes home, and the kitchen's hot. He said, "You've got the air conditioning on. You're cooking in the house, and it's 80 degrees outside. Open the windows. Let the breeze come in." I said, "You know, it was hot before." So then he was, I don't wanna say having a hissy fit, but he was really frustrated. And my daughter' sitting there, and she's looking at him like why is he acting like this? And I'm trying to stay calm, and I said, "It was hot. We put the air conditioning on. It's okay." So then he kept, he, he must have stood there for a few minutes, kept on saying the same things. So I finally said, "Okay. Why don't we open the windows. I'll shut off the air conditioning. You put the fan in to draw the air through. Fine." And, and, and the, all of a sudden he got defused , and it was like, okay, well, why didn't you just say that in the first place? So then afterwards I said to him, I said, "You know, don't you have some respect for me wanting to be cooled off when I'm cooking?" I mean, you know. And, and that really bothered me. It just, I felt hurt because I felt like he wasn't respecting my need, and, and my solution. My solution was putting the air conditioning on, you know. 

00:59:55
[sil.] 

00:59:55
Venting Female Complete the following sentence "In my relationship, I don't feel understood when . . ." 

00:59:55
JOHN GRAY We can go on to understanding, uh, recall a time when you didn't feel like he understood. 

01:00:00
KIM Well, generally, um, for me I have a hard time if, if I'm trying to, um, tell Cy something, especially about parenting. And, um, if I'm a little bit critical, he tends to think he's a total failure. You know, and, um, as a stepfather of, um, five children, sometimes I think he's a little bit tough on my daughter. But if I sit there and tell him, "Could you go a little bit easier." cuz he's never had girls before. He doesn't understand why they need phones, why they need to be in the bathroom more than ten minutes. And, you know, it's like I did this stuff. And he's like, "She's not normal." I'm like, "I did it too." "Well, then you're not normal." So, but, if I sit there and try to tell him, "You know, could you go easy. You know, you don't have to be so hard." then he just completely takes it the other way and looks at it as if he's a total failure. And I'm not saying that. And I wish that he'd understand. I appreciate all the efforts he made. I know how hard it is to raise five kids that aren't your own. You know, especially daughters that he's never had. But, um, at the same time, you know, I wish that sometimes he would hear what I'm saying rather than misinterpret everything. 

01:01:15
DELLA That happens in my house, too, cuz my husband's, he's a monster when he gets mad at the kids. I mean, he's like, he scares me. And my little girl, she's three years old, so I mean, to me, when you're upset at the child, the child, like, if she doesn't dry her hands all the way, she washes her hands on her own. She doesn't dry them all the way. Maybe they're not dried all the way, but they're dried, and she did this to dry. Well, they're not dried all the way, and he just like, you know , "Go dry your hands." And I mean, but like in this , in this voice. I mean, it's, it's a horrible, horrible thing that comes out, all because she didn't dry her hands completely. I'm like, "Bret, is it necessary to like, yell at her?" And at this point she's like in tears. She's not heard "Go dry your hands again. Make sure all the water's off." because all she felt was this humongous roar, monster thing come out of her father, who loves her, who she loves. But she, I said, "Is it necessary to yell, because she's not hearing you. She's busy crying because she's so upset that you just yelled at her. You've taken away that whole connection between wet hands and drying them. Now it's, all she can do is feel how hurt she is from you yelling." But, I mean, he still does it, and a lot of times when it's comes in with the discipline of the kids. And I think that then loses something, because she gets, she's too little for that. I don't think that's the answer. And I tell him I don't think that's the answer, but I guess it's a respect example. He doesn't respect my opinion and that's, I don't feel that that's the answer, the yelling. So, I can relate to that. 

01:02:55
JOHN GRAY Good example. 

01:03:00
BEV I guess for me it's, um, I don't feel like he understands what I'm saying sometimes. Um, I know what I'm saying, and the more he says, "Huh? Huh? Huh?" the more confused I get and unsure I get. Um, then because I don't know what he wants to , how he wants me to rephrase it, I guess. 

01:03:20
ARLIS Well, I don't know if my husband ever understands me, because, or at least not in the moment that I'm talking. He may come back later and acknowledge that he heard what I said, but at the moment that I'm talking, he never understands what I'm saying. And, it's almost as though it's a tit for tat. I have to win out because I'm the male, and I'm the head of the household, which he tells me a trillion and one times. I know who the head of the household is. But, he has to keep reminding me that he is the head of the household. Okay, you're the head of the household, so therefore, this is just an opinion that I have of how I think we should do something. So, I think I, I'm trying to, to determine if he says that so that he comes off as being the head of the household or something or he doesn't want me to really have a say, you know. It needs to be his idea, sometimes I will , um, try to make it seem as though it was his idea so that maybe we kinda get through this a little bit better. But, uh, I do think that , I don't know. I just think that it becomes, I'm not gonna let her win out, cuz I'm the male and I'm the head of the household. So, I think it's a refusal to really hear me. But, there have been occasions where he'll come back later and acknowledge in his own little way that he has heard what I said. And so we went through all that arguing for nothing. 

01:04:50
Venting Female Complete the following sentence "In my relationship I don't feel cared for when . . ." 

01:04:50
JOHN GRAY Why don't we shift to the third question, which is recalling a time when you didn't feel your needs were being met. He didn't seem to care or he wasn't considerate or he wasn't giving you the little things that you wanted, that you feel you'd like. 

01:05:05
KIM I had a situation happen, happen a couple of days ago where Cy got really upset, but I didn't know what he was upset at. I mean, I could tell with his body language and, just, you know, his whole effect that he was upset and hurt about something. But he wouldn't tell me. And, um, you know, it's hard for me because he just wanted to be left alone. And just, I'm not mad at you, just leave me alone, but it was really hard not to take it personal, you know, because he's snipping at all of us, and yet he's telling us that we're not, you know, whatever the problem and, um, it's really hard for me to give him that space sometimes that he needs. And, um, you know, I, I understand that men need their own space and things, but it's hard sometimes, you know, as a woman when you just see him have a hard time, and he won't tell you what it's about. There's no way you can really help. 

01:06:05
JOHN GRAY So, you would feel he was more considerate if he would just tell you something briefly. At least you'd be included a little or something. 

01:06:15
KIM Yeah, and if he could maybe, you know, understand how, um, you know, how concerned, you know, I am about his feelings. And when he just shuts down and doesn't share it, it's almost like, you know, I don't matter. And he just completely closes up. 

01:06:30
JOHN GRAY It would work for him to say, "You do matter, and I can't talk about it right now, and I will talk about it." 

01:06:35
KIM That would work well. 

01:06:35
JOHN GRAY That would seem like considerate, like he's caring somewhat for you. Cuz if he can't share, he can't share. It has nothing to do with you, but to wait, to be considerate of you is to say something. And that's what we have to work out with your partner, is what, what could he say that would make you feel like you weren't just being completely forgotten or excluded or ignored. 

01:06:55
BEV Um, mine kinda has to do with a bit of road rage that my husband goes through sometimes. And like, it's, uh, when he's out on the road, and it's like it has to be one of these tit for tats, like, if somebody does something to him, you know, he has to retaliate. But, I'm like in the car with him, and I'm totally opposite. I'm a very peaceful calm person. I don't want to start problems, you know. And, I'm really paranoid because I know a there's a lot of these guns that kill, you know, everybody. But, um, it's more and more I tell him not to do it, maybe that's understanding and respect and everything else. But more and more it almost like eggs him on to, to keep on doing it and to get worse. I have, it's like he has to prove a point, you know, um, no matter. And so in that way I don't feel like I'm, he's caring for, for me, you know, in the car and for my safety. 

01:07:50
ARLIS When I get upset in an argument or something and I get upset, and I start to cry, he's the least affectionate at that point. He just stares at me. He just becomes cold and callous. He doesn't hug me. He doesn't touch me. He doesn't do anything. And that just feels so uncaring to me. It just, like, how can you sit there and watch me cry. I got kleenex and all this. You don't do anything. You don't say anything. You don't try to make me feel better. How could you possibly care, you know. So I never have been able to, and he can't really explain to me why he freezes up when I cry. I mean, if you were around somebody's that's crying, don't you at least touch them or put your hand on their back or. 

01:08:30
DELLA You would think so. 

01:08:30
ARLIS Something. He does nothing. He just , he just goes. 

01:08:35
DELLA Well, my husband does. Only when I cry though. Cuz, we'll talk about, talk about the issue, and I'll talk about the issue and talk about the issue, like I was just saying, and he gets in this big ugly mess, and he gets to the point where he doesn't care. The marriage is for nothing, and then I cry. And then I usually leave the room because at that point I, I hate him. You know, he's causing me a lot of pain right now. So, in fact, that just happened four weeks ago, and then he came downstairs. And I'm like... 

01:09:00
ARLIS Don't touch me. 

01:09:00
DELLA He's sitting there next to me. He's like... 

01:09:00
ARLIS Don't touch me. 

01:09:00
DELLA he's like this. I'm like, "Don't come to me now. You don't understand, and you don't care. Don't come to me now, now that I'm crying. Now all of a sudden you care cuz I cry." It doesn't happen often, but that does happen, so I know what you're saying. 

01:09:15
ARLIS You have just the opposite problem I have, don't you? 

01:09:20
DELLA Well, yeah, but am I using it as a manipulation? 

01:09:20
ARLIS But, you're not. Are you? Or are you? 

01:09:25
DELLA I don't think so. 

01:09:25
ARLIS Or are you? 

01:09:25
JOHN GRAY You're punishing him for not. 

01:09:30
DELLA Is that, I'm manipulating him then. 

01:09:30
JOHN GRAY Well, after you've opened up and you've shared your pain, then he finally gets he needs to come to you. And, at that point now you're playing the other side of it. He made a mistake. Now, he made a mistake, so I'm gonna push you away. So you push away the attempts to try to reconcile. 

01:09:45
DELLA Well, we eventually do make up actually. 

01:09:50
JOHN GRAY Yeah, I'm sure, cuz you're here together. But, that's, that's what you have to, that's what you have to keep looking at, is how you will tend to, when he does ant to do the right thing, you had your chance. And that's the punishing that women will tend to do. And for you with the, the understanding the mystery of the man who can't respond when you're in your feelings, probably he was manipulated by emotions when he was growing up, so he was blocked by it. Most mothers use emotions to manipulate children. So, he will, be have a block, but it can be easily overcome by just simply saying, "You don't have to do anything. You don't have to say anything. Just come over here and hold me." Now, that's hard to do because it feels humiliating, like, cuz you're assumption is that if someone's crying, wouldn't you just naturally reach over. Guys don't natural reach over and touch each other. If somebody, they don't even show that they're crying, but if they do, they kind of ignore him, like not to embarrass him that we're noticing that he's crying. So, it's a different world, so he really doesn't know what to do at that time. He's like, has no idea what to do. 

01:10:55
ARLIS That's just how he looks. Just like. 

01:10:55
JOHN GRAY His, his computer crashes. He has no idea, cuz now we're not even talking reason or anything. It's just tears. What do I do? And the only thing he can register at that moment is I somehow hurt you, and I don't want to do anything more to hurt you. So he stops. So if you tell him, "You don't have to say anything. You don't have to change any way. Just hold me. It'll make me feel better." It's a simple job description. He can do it. And then, you just soften in his arms and have a little cry. And he goes, "Hey, I did this. I did the right thing." And gradually he learns a new skill. So, we'll do one more on, uh, on caring. 

01:11:35
CONNIE Um, all I can think about is, um, when we were talking before about sexuality and how, uh, a woman needs to talk and this kind of stuff. Well, we were at a board meeting the other night, and, and he was so, he stood up against the board, and presented his case very well, and so articulately. You know, I was just so proud of him. And we went home, and I was feeling this pride, and feeling this connection. And thinking, okay, it's very late, and he's sharing it with everybody, the kids were so excited. Dad you did a great job, and all this. And everyone was so excited. He couldn't stop talking. He's just going on and on. I said, "You know, it's really late. I'm, I'd really like to go to bed." And he's still talking and talking. I'm thinking, "Okay, Hank. Don't you think." Come on guys. Everybody, let's all go to bed. What are you supposed to say in front of your children? Okay, Hank, let's go to bed. So, he's carrying on. Finally I said, "I'm going to bed. You guys can stay up and talk all you want." But I felt like how many other cues could you give? I mean, you know, put my arm around him. You really were good, honey, you know. I don't know what else I could have done. Finally, after I went to bed and I, I got very stern with the kids and said, "You guys need to go to bed." And, and it was like, I just honestly felt hurt because I figured, you know, all the other times, and all the other advances or whatever, when I may be feeling tired, you know, and, and here it's my chance to make advances and it, it just wasn't clicking. And I don't know what else I could have said. But anyway, I truly did feel, um, uncared for. 

01:13:20
JOHN GRAY Well, this is a complaining session or a venting session, but since you have me here, I'll give you something you could say, speaking from a man from Mars, is on the way home in the car, before, are the kids in the car? 

01:13:30
CONNIE The kids are in the car. 

01:13:30
JOHN GRAY You whisper in his ear, "Something you said tonight really turned me on." Or you even go on to say, "Honey, you did such a great job." Whisper in his ear, "I'm really wet." 

01:13:45
DELLA Well, that'll do it. 

01:13:45
JOHN GRAY And he'll totally love it, and he'll know exactly the message. And you really haven't had to push yourself, and you just described what you're feeling inside and what's happening. And that's music to his ears, you know. He's gonna go, "Glory to me." 

01:14:05
CONNIE Glory hallelujah. 

01:14:05
JOHN GRAY So, let's just take a minute to go around one more time and just remember a time when your husband was caring or was understanding or was respectful. Just to finish up with a positive note. It's always good to finish on a positive, to remember who this wonderful guy really is. 

01:14:20
KIM This is an easier part for me. Um, cuz Cy's, um, wonderful. And, um, he's really caring. I especially see it with how supportive he is with, um, my interests and my school work. Just anything at all he can do for me. I mean there's no expense that he can do as far as the kids. He just, he always gives that top priority, and that really means a lot to me. 

01:14:45
JOHN GRAY Beautiful. 

01:14:45
BEV Um, I think it's just like, every night, he just says I love you or gives me a kiss. I mean, it's just finishing the day, you know, It's just, just a nice way to, just to feel good, and he never takes, I never feel like I'm taken for granted. You know, it's like the little things you do and say, you know. 

01:15:00
DELLA Uh, you, I don't know if I can say this. You mentioned earlier that, that passion usually lasts three years, and that it leaves the relationship. Well, my husband and I dated for seven, so the passion was gone a long time ago really. And then we've been married now seven years, so, you know, I'm speaking from the longevity. The passion has been gone. So a long time ago in our relationship, uh, I was doing some therapy for myself that I needed to do. And I got to a point where I knew I could no longer go without him, because I was gonna become somebody else without him. So, I, I, I told him. Actually then, I don't think he was my husband yet. And, uh, he went with me and we grew together, and it was probably the only event or thing he's ever done that made me know, actually know, that this relationship is right and will work, because he will do whatever, when push comes to shove, he will do whatever he has to do for him and I together. 

01:16:10
ARLIS Um, he does things, like when I come home from work, he'll say, "How's your day? Sit down next to me, tell me what happened." I just love that. Or, he'll call me at work and say, "I love you." and things. You know, he doesn't have to do those kinds of things, and I, I'm really appreciative. And I'm thinking, "I hope this never stops.", you know. Um, but, I, I do. I love it, and I tell him that I like it. And, uh, I hope he, hope he realizes that. 

01:16:35
JOHN GRAY If you tell him, he realizes it for sure. 

01:16:40

Exercise 2 The Feeling Letter 

01:16:40
The Feeling Letter What I am angry about is. . . 

01:16:40
The Feeling Letter What I am sad about is. . . 

01:16:40
The Feeling Letter What I am afraid of is. . . 

01:16:40
The Feeling Letter What I regret is. . . 

01:16:40
THE FEELING LETTER WHAT I WANT FROM MY PARTNER IS. . . 

01:16:40
The Feeling Letter Now write the response you want to hear from your partner. Imagine that you have gotten that response. Write what you feel. 

01:16:40
The Feeling Letter I forgive you for. . . 

01:16:40
The Feeling Letter I thank you for. . . 

01:16:40
JOHN GRAY How many of you can relate to sometimes being stuck in negative feelings. Just raise your hands if you can. Okay. The technique I'm gonna talk, everybody can but it's good to acknowledge that I'm from earth here. We're from Mars and Venus, we're also live on earth, and we do get stuck in these negative feelings. After a while, after we've been stuck for a while, it will go away, and then we're fine and normal again. But, what you have to know is that we repress those feelings. That's why we feel better. They get pushed like into a box, deep into our unconscious. But, in, in terms of a metaphor, if you could imagine a big heart here. Every time you have a bunch of upset feelings and you're stuck for a while, then you forget it, and everything's fine, you've formed a brick. And you're building a wall in front of your heart. Every time you're upset and you don't deal with those feelings by letting them go and feeling more love, but instead, pushing them down, it's like putting another brick, another brick, another brick. And you don't notice this as this wall's going up for a few years. And then after a few years, you've got a wall, and now your'e hiding behind it. And you don't know why, but you no longer can feel the passion that you felt before, because there's a wall in front of you. This is a technique to keep from building that wall, and if you've built that wall, how to start taking it down one brick at a time. Every time you do this exercise, if you do have a wall, it's like taking a brick out. And if you're doing it, it's preventing you from building a wall around your heart. So, you can stay in touch with your, your positive feelings. To be proactive or at cause or responsible for creating love in your life, when you have the negativity, don't suppress it, don't dump it, don't make your partner responsible for it. Take responsibility yourself. And this tool works. As you practice it, you'll get better at it until eventually you learn to feel your feelings and let go of them. You won't even need to write them out. But, it's a writing exercise. It's very powerful to use writing, because when you write, you're using both parts of the brain. And so both sides of you sort of get, the full self gets activated. You do it in private. You write out what you're feeling, and so you're, you're not concerned about what anybody's thinking. You don't have to edit yourself. You're not feeling like you're waiting for this person to acknowledge you to, before you feel better. You're taking responsibility to look at what you're feeling and letting go of it. See, there's lots of times we want to feel our love, wanna feel our passion, but we can't. We're just numb. How do you get unnumb? You write what am I bothered about. So you use the negativity to come alive again. You feel your anger, your sadness, your fears, your sorrow, then you get in touch with what is it that I want. And that's where passion comes up. I want, I love, I forgive. So this is a feeling letter. You write out negative emotions, then you write out your positive emotions, and then you feel better. And then you can take that letter and throw it, tear it up, put it in a fire, burn it or file it . I like to file mine at my computer because quite often when I'm upset with my wife, I don't have to write letter. I can just pull up one of the other ones. It's true. We really get upset about the same things over and over. I just read the letter. Yup, yup, that's me. That's me. That's how I feel. So, in, also it's good experience to realize that most of your issues are really not about your partner. They're about your issues. We have our issues that come up again and again and again. We shouldn't expect ourselves to be perfect like we're perfect beings without issues. Everybody's got issues, and thank goodness they're the same ones over and over. And instead of thinking, "Oh, it's the same thing over and over." Instead, look at it more positively. Oh, it's my issue. And each time I go through it, I get better at going through it. What we're gonna do, what's your name? 

01:20:05
CONNIE Connie 

01:20:05
JOHN GRAY Connie. This is Connie. Instead of writing, we're gonna do it out loud, so you can sort of get a sense of how it's done, and I'll be leading you through it, Connie. And I'll be asking you questions, and what I'd like you to do is just, it's like random flow of thought. You're not trying to be linear or logical here. You're just taking whatever comes up randomly. It doesn't have to make sense. It doesn't have to be accurate. So, you wanna give yourself permission to make a big deal out of it on an emotional level, but move through it, and let go of it. And then come back to the big deal of how much love you feel. And so, that's what we're gonna practice doing here. So, I'd like you to close your eyes, cuz basically you're feeling rather nice today, but we're gonna go back and recall a time, if you close your eyes now, and I'd like you to just go back in time, and remember a time that was painful or difficult for you in your marriage. And, recall what happened, what was going on that bothered you. Give yourself permission to feel I don't deserve this kind of situation. I don't like what's going on. This is not what I want to happen. Those are the angry feelings. And, what I'd like you to do is imagine you're sitting down on a, you're writing your husband a letter. He's never really gonna hear this letter or see this letter. You just, you're having the freedom to vent. This is not like you're giving him a lecture. You're just writing out, as if you're talking to your husband. What are you angry about? I'd like you just to say right now , say dear so-and-so. What's your husband's name? 

01:21:40
The Feeling Letter What I am angry about is. . . 

01:21:40
CONNIE Hank. 

01:21:40
JOHN GRAY Dear Hank. I'm angry, and then you just begin talking for the next couple minutes about what makes you angry. 

01:21:50
CONNIE Uh, dear Hank, I'm angry about the way you withdraw when you're mad at me. 

01:21:55
JOHN GRAY What else makes you angry? 

01:21:55
CONNIE Uh, just your inability to see that I have things that are important to me, and that I just really want to take care of the commitments that I have made, and you're not my sole focus in this world. 

01:22:15
JOHN GRAY I'm angry you expect more from me than I can give you. 

01:22:20
CONNIE I am angry that you expect more from me than I can give you. 

01:22:25
The Feeling Letter What I am sad about is. . . 

01:22:25
JOHN GRAY Now that's the first part. Now you shift gears, and you go a little deeper inside and you feel how much that hurts inside. And let yourself feel the sadness that you're not getting what you need. You're not getting understanding, the attention, the caring, the support. Give yourself permission to feel sad about it.What makes you feel sad? As if you're talking to him, what would you say in your letter? I'm sad that, sad because. 

01:22:55
CONNIE Well, I'm sad because I feel unloved. I feel, um, that you just don't care. And you care more about your wants and needs than mine. 

01:23:10
JOHN GRAY And what else makes you sad? 

01:23:15
CONNIE Well, I feel unappreciated. Um, I wanna feel valuable, and I just don't feel like I'm meeting your needs, obviously. So, I guess I'm a failure in that. 

01:23:40
JOHN GRAY So, say that again, I feel sad because I feel like a failure. 

01:23:45
CONNIE I feel sad because I feel like a failure. 

01:23:45
JOHN GRAY That must be a lonely feeling. 

01:23:50
CONNIE It's a very lonely feeling. 

01:23:50
JOHN GRAY Say that, I feel sad because I feel so alone. 

01:23:55
CONNIE I feel, I do. I feel very alone, and because I feel unconnected to you. 

01:24:05
JOHN GRAY You feel that pain. The pain of feeling disconnected. So, that's sad. Now we go a little deeper. You feel pain, you can go into feeling the fears associated with the pain. And although they may not make sense, you just go into that place. What are you afraid of when you're feeling that pain? 

01:24:30
The Feeling Letter What I am afraid of is. . . 

01:24:30
Connie I'm afraid of being left alone. I think about, um, the distance it's caused, and then the fear of what if it's really a permanent thing. What if the distance is not just gonna be a temporary. What if he never comes out of this feeling? And then I have to go on alone, raising the kids by myself. Doing all these other things by myself. 

01:25:00
JOHN GRAY Keep feeling that sense of fear. I have to do it alone. I have to do everything myself. What else are you afraid of? 

01:25:15
[sil.] 

01:25:15
JOHN GRAY How about I'm afraid if I say something you won't listen. I'm afraid if I ask you to change you'll get mad at me. I'm afraid if I try to make things better it won't get better. 

01:25:30
CONNIE I'm afraid I'll push you farther away with whatever I say. 

01:25:30
JOHN GRAY Now we'll go a little bit deeper. And as you feel that pain, feel this sense of powerlessness, cuz always underneath every upset is a feeling of powerlessness. And feel how you wish things could be and what you feel sorry about. What do you feel sorry about? What are your regrets? Just and as you feel that pain, you're talking to him. What do you feel sorry about? 

01:25:55
The Feeling Letter What I regret is. . . 

01:25:55
CONNIE I do feel sorry that I'm not better, that I'm not doing things , um, in a more productive way, that would make things run smoother. 

01:26:20
[sil.] 

01:26:20
JOHN GRAY You can feel that pain coming up, can't you? Feel that. That's your regret. What else do you feel sorry about? 

01:26:30
CONNIE I'm sorry I don't know how to talk so that you can listen. 

01:26:35
JOHN GRAY That's a big one. And now use the phrase, I wish. 

01:26:40
CONNIE I wish I could talk in a way that you could listen to what I'm saying. 

01:26:45
JOHN GRAY And what else do you wish? 

01:26:50
CONNIE I wish you could understand where I am at and what I need. 

01:26:55
JOHN GRAY And what else do you wish? 

01:26:55
CONNIE And I wish I could understand what you need. 

01:27:00
JOHN GRAY And do you want? 

01:27:00
CONNIE I want connection. I want to be , um, united again. 

01:27:15
JOHN GRAY Go a little deeper than that. What else do you want? What do you want to feel? 

01:27:15
CONNIE I want to feel loved. 

01:27:20
JOHN GRAY Say that and feel it a little bit. Go a little deeper than that. Feel it. I wanna feel loved. 

01:27:25
CONNIE I wanna feel loved. 

01:27:30
The Feeling Letter I forgive you for. . . 

01:27:30
JOHN GRAY That's good. Those are good. Now we shift gears one more shift, which is use the phrase, I forgive you for. 

01:27:35
CONNIE I forgive you for not being what I imagine you should have been. I forgive you for not understanding me the way that I wanted you to understand me. 

01:27:50
JOHN GRAY And feel your love, and express your appreciation for him, what you do appreciate. 

01:28:00
The Feeling Letter I thank you for. . . 

01:28:00
CONNIE I do appreciate , I do appreciate when you, um, can touch me and hold me. And I do appreciate that you are working hard to provide for our home. And that you do have so many things that you're balancing also. I do appreciate that you do want love from me. 

01:28:30
JOHN GRAY And, what do you understand? A little understanding come up. Use the phrase, I understand. 

01:28:35
CONNIE I understand that I do blow things up sometimes in my own mind because of my own needs. 

01:28:45
JOHN GRAY And use the phrase, I trust. 

01:28:50
CONNIE I trust your commitment to me, and I do trust your love for me. 

01:28:55
JOHN GRAY And now you finish your letter and say you love him. And whatever else you wanna say. 

01:29:00
The Feeling Letter The loving feelings that I have for my partner are. . . 

01:29:00
CONNIE I do love you, Hank. As always, Connie. 

01:29:10
JOHN GRAY That's the first step. Now the second step. Imagine that he listened to your letter or he read his letter. Read that letter. What would you want him to say to you. What would you want his response to be? Just take a couple of minutes to write out saying out loud the response you'd wanna hear from him. After he read that letter what response would you wanna hear from him? Dear Connie. 

01:29:35
The Feeling Letter Now write the response you want to hear from your partner. Imagine that you have gotten that response. Write what you feel. 

01:29:35
CONNIE Dear Connie I'm truly sorry that I didn't realize that you were under so much pressure. That you had so much going on. And I am sorry that I didn't help you or support you in your efforts. I am sorry for being crabby, and I'm sorry for not talking to you and not showing you how much I love you. 

01:30:00
JOHN GRAY That's beautiful. And having, add a second step, you say what it is you want the person to say to you. And the third step is now you imagine, if he had said those things to you, how would it make you feel? Love yourself. Let yourself just say your love makes me feel. 

01:30:20
CONNIE Your love makes me feel warm and secure. 

01:30:25
JOHN GRAY I'm grateful for. 

01:30:25
CONNIE I'm grateful for having someone like you to love me. 

01:30:30
JOHN GRAY And I trust. 

01:30:35
CONNIE And I trust that you will be there and that you will continue to love me all the days of our lives. 

01:30:45
JOHN GRAY Nicely done. Take a deep breath. Let's give her a big hand. Thank you very much. Good job. Now that you've got your notebook and pen, it's time to write your first feeling letter. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes. And do it now, because if you don't do it now, you never will. One of the hardest things in this world is to do the right thing. We get stuck in our negative feelings. We're stuck. All it takes is making a choice to write a feeling letter. Sometimes if you're stuck, you don't wanna feel better. But, If you wanna feel better, you can feel better if you write a feeling letter. Give yourself that experience right now, so you'll know what to do in the future when you're stuck. If you don't give yourself that experience now, you'll probably never do it. So, do it now. Get the practice. And then in the future when you really need it, you'll be able to do it. So, pull out the format, the feeling letter format. The questions are there. Take a couple minutes with each of the questions. Complete the exercise. You'll feel better. 

01:32:00

Please Pause Here & Write 

01:32:00
Exercise 3 Listening especially for men 

01:32:00
JON CARLSON Now this is the second activity you've done that I was skeptical of at the beginning that seems to have worked wonderfully. And now we're gonna move into the third one. And the third has to do with, you know, we talked about talking to someone of the same sex, and journaling yourself. And the third activity, John, is. 

01:32:25
JOHN GRAY Well, the third activity to keep passion alive in a relationship. This connects us back to our feelings inside. So, we have the passion. There's just maintenance of passion. You know, when, uh, particularly one of the greatest needs women have is to talk and to share and to feel understood, that their partner's interested. And many men don't know what to do with that time. They don't know why it's so important. They often make the mistake of interrupting her fifteen times, giving her solutions. So this is the third exercise we're gonna practice how women can share about the problems in their life, not about him. Remember the problems about him, you do it in your letter or you vent with your girlfriends and you comfort. And you just basically ask him fro constructive change. You don't have big discussions on feelings with him. But if you have problems at work, in life whatever, go to him and say, "Let's talk about this." And there's specific guidelines so that he can do it. Otherwise he can't do it. 

01:33:15
JON CARLSON I hope you put some time parameters on this, cuz I've got a day job. 

01:33:15
JOHN GRAY That's very very important. 

01:33:15
JON CARLSON And I can just imagine this going on and on and on. 

01:33:20
JOHN GRAY You know, lots of times women complain he's not listening. But you know, we all have the experience of going into a doctor's office, and you see all these people waiting. What's your experience? You go, you don't know how long this is gonna go on, so what do you do? You pick up a magazine and read it. And so often, a woman starts talking. A man doesn't know when it's gonna be over, so he thinks, might as well pick up a magazine and start reading it. He'll start looking at the TV. He'll get distracted. He'll look around, cuz he doesn't know closure. Men need to know how long something's gonna be, and then they go, "Okay, I can do that." So, the secret of sharing at the end of the day is one, to ask a man. Just say, "Hey, I'd like to talk about, you know, what happened today. It'll just take about five minutes." Give them a length of time limit. And that's hard for a woman to do. What women will tend to do from Venus, is instead of saying, "Would you listen to me for five minutes." What they'll do, "I'd like to talk for five minutes, all you have to do is listen." See, that would be rude to say on Venus. If I'm a Venusian and you're a Venusian, and I wanna talk for five minutes, you know how I tell you I wanna talk? I say, "How was your day?" And I get you to talk for five minutes, then you have to listen to me for five minutes, cuz you owe me. That's like the rules. So when a woman wants to talk, instead of saying I wanna talk, what she'll tend to do is try to get you to talk. But the man doesn't wanna talk. So, he says, you know, "Ah, not interested." so there's no conversations, and she gets frustrated, when her primary need is she needs to talk. 

01:34:40
Exercise 3 Listening especially for men Demonstration 

01:34:40
JOHN GRAY Before you begin this third exercise at home, let's look at an example sample exercise with Arlis and Julius. Uh, they've agreed to do the exercise. And the simple principle in this exercise is the woman talks about her day, about her problems, about her troubles, about things that didn't go wrong. Now why would one wanna do that? On Mars, we don't know why, but on Venus it's a clear answer. If you can talk about the things that are bothering you, then you can forget them. It's a very important thing to be looking at the woman when she talks. Otherwise, she doesn't stay as focused as she needs to be, because she wants to expand and talk about this and this and this, and there needs to be another force kind of holding her together. And that's what your attention does. Your attention, your presence, your listening actually helps her enormously. So, you can begin now. You just say, "How was your day?" 

01:35:35
JULIUS How was your day, sweetheart? 

01:35:35
ARLIS Oh, my gosh, emotionally draining. You just would not believe this email that I got from a manager at work today. Let me see if I, I think I brought it home so you could read it. You wanna read it? 

01:35:50
JULIUS Sure. 

01:35:50
ARLIS Read that. I could just not believe her, what she said. I mean, why would she send an email like that to me. I mean, you know, here I am trying to organize a department and, and, and to get it the way it should be, and I guess I'm just not accustomed to a manager sending an email like that to a director. I thought it was very disrespectful and, uh, didn't quite know how I should handle that. You know, I'm new at this in this position, and, um, this company and, if this was someplace else, I don't know if I should go over and talk to the person, if I should go talk to the executive director or if I should go talk to my boss. I don't know, so I, you know, I read the email, and I contemplated before I responded. And I thought I'd maybe respond in the morning or something after I talked you about it. But, it just really really bothered me. It's like she feels like she has the authority to say that kind of thing to me, you know. It just really upset me. I felt like going in her office and cursing her out, but I thought, "That's not my style, you know." So, I didn't wanna do that. I started to call you. I did call you at work, but you weren't available. So, I thought I'd just. 

01:36:55
JULIUS I'm sorry I wasn't there. 

01:36:55
ARLIS had to wait till I got home. So, I don't know. I mean, do you think I should go talk to the executive director? Should I, you know, email, respond back to her? I don't know what I should do. I mean, I don't know. 

01:37:10
JULIUS Um, what do you really feel like doing? 

01:37:15
ARLIS Well, I don't know if I should go into her office and say something to her myself or if I should go to talk to her boss or if I should go talk to the executive director of the association or, you know, what I should really do. I guess I was really taken aback by her sending this email. I don't know if she, who she copied, you know, there's ways you can blind your emails that's sent to anybody. And, uh, I just don't believe in being disrespected. So, maybe tomorrow I'll respond to her and, no, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna send that to the executive director and, and talk to him about it, and see what he thinks about it rather than just go directly to her. 

01:38:00
JULIUS You think you're giving yourself enough time to, uh, to manage yourself so that you can maintain your composure while doing this? 

01:38:05
ARLIS Well, that's why I thought I'd wait until tomorrow, because I was so upset today I thought whatever I said today would just, you know, not be. 

01:38:15
JULIUS You think 24 hours will be enough time? 

01:38:15
ARLIS Well, yeah. I thought you might, you know, talking it out with you might help me to come to some kind of a solution on what I should do. Um, I'm just not accustomed to that. 

01:38:25
JULIUS Of course I have a solution, you know. 

01:38:25
ARLIS I know you do. But, you know, to receive that in, in addition to all the other responsibilities I'm trying to take care of. Um, I would think that this kind of behavior would not be allowed. I mean, I come from large organizations, and I've never seen this kind of disrespect. And so, I'm kinda taken back by it. I wanna be able to handle the situation correctly. 

01:38:50
JULIUS And it's a new experience for you. 

01:38:50
ARLIS Right. Right. So, you have any suggestions? 

01:38:55
JUILIUS Um, yes. But, I think it would be best if you , you handled this yourself. Um, I don't wanna lead you in a direction that might not benefit you. And so, I think, uh, possibly, uh, you holding off and doing what you have to do, uh, giving yourself a period of time to cool off and to keep yourself composed. I think that's a good idea. That's a good plan. 

01:39:30
ARLIS Well, tomorrow I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna forward the email on to the executive director, and then I'm just gonna have a meeting with him and see what he thinks we should do from there. I mean, I'm hoping that this type of behavior is not acceptable by the company. If, if so, maybe I've gone in with the wrong company. I, I hope not. 

01:39:50
ARLIS What, what do you 

01:39:50
JOHN GRAY Your three minutes has passed. So what you wanna do in practicing this technique, is you wanna keep in mind he's been listening and listening. He's not interrupting. He's doing the right thing. About three minutes, you gotta give him the reward. The reward is you just say, "It's so good to talk to you about this. I feel so much better. You know, just being able to get this out was really helpful." So, use your own words, but now you wanna, you wanna like close the conversation, cuz it could go on forever, you know. And so you wanna like give him a sense that these things open up, and they close. So at this point, you just wanna close it by just letting him know that, how, how you felt being able to just talk without him solving anything. 

01:40:30
ARLIS Well, I think I'm, I'm real glad that I had a chance to at least talk it through with you, and I'm getting some ideas on what I should do tomorrow. And, I'm, I'm real glad you didn't try to solve it for me, and kinda listened to what I had to say and what I think I might want to do. And, um, tomorrow I'll go ahead and take my action. So I appreciate your listening to me. 

01:40:50
JULIUS It makes me feel worthwhile. 

01:40:50
JOHN GRAY That's good. Let's give them a big hand. Excellent job. Okay. Good. Now, at home this is a wonderful example. You were able to talk about a subject. The man just listens. He doesn't say anything. If you ask for something, he gave a brief kind of solution, but I'm sure you had a huge lecture you could have given. I mean, were you practicing restraint throughout that? 

01:41:10
JULIUS Yes, sir. 

01:41:10
JOHN GRAY Yeah. A lot of restraint. See, nobody else could tell, but as a guy I know. You were like perfect, setting up one problem after another And she was even doing the thing that's just a big test, guys. Women will say, "I didn't know what to do. I mean, what could I have done?" And a guy is like, you know, hold back. Wanna give a solution. And you go, "Yes." And then, and then you saw, she would just continue talking. And that's the thing most men don't realize is when women are asking those questions like I don't know what to do, what would you do, it's a rhetorical question. It's kinda just expressing the feeling of, gee it wasn't, there wasn't a clear answer. What could I do? And you just have to occasionally just nod your head and go, "Yeah, then what?" And you just, or what you said, well you could do this But, what do you think? Just something little to then prod the woman to continue talking. And the result is how do you feel? 

01:42:00
ARLIS You feel better. I mean, you've talked about it, and you've had an opportunity to share. And pretty much, you already know what you wanna do, you just need to try to talk it out. 

01:42:10
JOHN GRAY And this is the secret, men, cuz see, guys are always thinking about, okay, how's the passion coming out of this. What's happened is the energy which is in her head I slowly now moving down to the jaws, which slowly moves down to the heart. And she's gonna be a much more loving partner as a result of having been able to talk about these different frustrations of the day. 

01:42:30
Please Pause Here & Practice

Exercise 4 Visualization 

01:42:30
JON CARLSON And you know, my job is to move on to exercise number four. Right. And I, this one I'm looking forward to. 

01:42:40
JOHN GRAY It's a very special exercise. What we're gonna look at here in this fourth exercise is something that I think every couple needs to do from time to time, which is renew their feelings of passion by remembering how they felt when they first met each other. The technique we're gonna do now is something you can do on a romantic getaway or you can do , you burn some candles at night, and you just simply talk. And just share, remembering old times. You can bring out an, an album. The pictures, you look at the pictures. You look at the things we used to do, cuz what we wanna do is keep coming back occasionally to remembering how we felt when we fell in love. And that's the exercise we're gonna do now. 

01:43:20
Exercise 4 Visualization Demonstration 

01:43:20
JOHN GRAY this is Kim and Cy. And what I'd like you to do is turn and face each other, Kim and Cy. And this is a holding hands exercise. I'd like you to close your eyes. And those of you at home, you can listen along as we're doing this exercise, and you'll be able to do it a little bit, little bit later. Take a deep breath. Now allow your awareness to drift back in time, and remember when you first met. Recall where it was, who introduced you, how you met. Remember how you felt when you first met each other. Maybe you were very excited or maybe you had doubts. Recall when you first held hands. Recall a first date. Remember what you felt like when you were planning that date or planning to ask her out or organize the date. Remember spending private time together. Remember some of your fears. Recall the time when you were really happy. Recall a time when your partner made you feel special. Recall a time when you felt your partner really understood. Remember how free you felt to reach out to this person. Remember as your heart opened and you felt you wanted to share your life with him, and you hoped that they wanted to do the same. Remember feeling how much you loved them, hoping they would love you the same. Recall a time your partner did something and you really appreciated them for it. Remember feeling that you really liked them. Recall a time when your partner made a mistake, disappointed you, but it was okay. Recall the first time you made up. Remember when your partner proposed marriage. Remember especially romantic evening. What did your partner say? What did your partner do? And now it's time, having reflected on some of these memories, I'd like the, when you do the exercise, its' always good for the woman to speak first, and the man to ask the questions first. And all the man simply says is, "What makes you feel loved?" And the woman, you imagine yourself back at that time when, when all those experiences were happening. Not right now in present time, imagine yourself in the past. You're partner's saying, "What makes you feel loved?", and you begin describing what makes you feel loved. Some of the things your partner said or did or circumstances. Please begin now. What makes you feel loved? 

01:47:15
CY What makes you feel loved? 

01:47:20
KIM i feel loved when, um, we would go out to dinner and you just did all the little things , um, from pulling out my chair and pouring my wine, and, um, just everything you did just made me feel so special. And I've never met somebody, um such nice manners.

01:48:15
CY What other things made you feel loved? 

01:48:20

01:48:35

01:48:50
CY Anything else make you feel loved? 

01:48:50
KIM I felt loved to just find somebody that I just knew I wanted to be with. You were just always there for me. 

01:49:05
JOHN GRAY And now we'll switch. And now, the woman will say, "What makes you feel loved?" What else makes you feel loved? And remember pretending you're back at that time, expressing the things that make you feel loved, the things your partner said or did. Please begin. 

01:49:20
KIM What makes you feel loved? 

01:49:25
CY How you're paying attention to things I say. Um, looking at me when actually talking to me. Uh, the little hand holding, things like that. 

01:49:35

01:49:40
CY Uh, your telling me that I'm special. Uh, you, you actually, uh, wanting to be with me. Uh, your caring attitude. Your patience. Uh, you, you accepting me for some of my quirks or phobias. 

01:50:05

01:50:10
CY Uh, your wanting to be held. Uh, even your intelligence and your worldliness, uh, makes me feel that way. 

01:50:25
KIM What else makes you feel loved? 

01:50:25
CY Uh, the phone calls. Uh, how you always sent pictures. Uh, the little messages, the little gifts. 

01:50:40

01:51:25
CY Um, you wanting to share , just wanting to be with you. 

01:51:35
JOHN GRAY That's beautiful. Now you can give each other a hug. 

01:51:40
JOHN GRAY Thank you for sharing that. That was really quite a delightful experience.

01:51:55
Please Listen Again Together & Practice 

01:51:55
JOHN GRAY Remember passion is automatic for the first three years. After that you have to do something to create a context for the passion to come back. And then it goes away. You have to do something to bring it back again. And you can enjoy it again and again, and it's even better because who you're passionately wanting to share your life with is someone that you know, not some stranger that you hope will be perfect. But you know their best side. You know their worst side, and you still love them. Knowing that my wife has seen my best and worst sides, and she still adores me and loves me, that makes me feel really loved and vice versa for her. 

01:52:30
JON CARLSON Well, I'd like to thank you, John, for helping to teach us how to reignite passion in our relationships. And, I think, I'm not sure about Mars and Venus, but you're a man from earth. Thank you very much. 

01:52:45
JOHN GRAY I appreciate that.
