BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
UNKNOWN  All right. Well, we're on. I'm wondering what would need to happen in this supervision so that when you left, you said 'That was not a waste of Ron's time.' 

00:00:15
RON Well, I think what we need to happen is that -- I don't necessarily have to be 100% unstuck, but I'd like to see, you know, a little bit of freeing up with this particular case that I'm going to staff with you today. 

00:00:30
UNKNOWN Okay. Can you tell me, uh, what it is, uh, that would let you know that you were freed up? 

00:00:45
RON Other ideas -- 

00:00:50
UNKNOWN Other ideas. 

00:00:50
RON -- other ways to look at -- at the situation. 

00:00:50
UNKNOWN Okay. Okay. Can you tell me whatever you think I should know about the case? 

00:00:55
RON Sure. I'd be happy to. Uh, this case involves a 41-year old transgendered male who, uh, is at the very beginning of a, uh, gender transformation process. And, um, since I work for a nonprofit agency, um, I'm just going to say it this way: What happens in behavioral health a lot of times, when insurance runs out, they give us the patient. I'm saying that nicely, of course. And, um, so I inherited him from a behavioral health agency when his insurance ran out. And so he is both transgendered and he's also OCD. 

00:01:40
UNKNOWN Um-hum. 

00:01:40
RON And as far as OCD goes, he's -- he's an accumulator; he's a -- he's a saver. And, um, during his first session, he presented to me, uh, the picture of side-by-side duplexes that he owns, that he has inherited actually, and, uh, they're filled with newspapers. There are only little -- tiny little paths to walk and that's about it. And, uh, different situations have come up, like, uh, the Nielsen people came and -- came and put a box on his television so they can monitor his TV programs. He was very embarrassed, um, by them coming. Yet he wanted to be part of this -- this survey. And, uh, I haven't yet done hypnosis with him, so I'm -- I'm about at the point that I may consider doing that. But, uh, the problem I'm having is that I'm questioning whether what he says -- what he wants is really what he wants. And basically he's saying that he connects with therapy because he would like to -- he would like to see this OCD problem, this problem of mass accumulation, um, eliminated, and, um, he would like to have space in his homes and have clean -- clean side-by-side duplexes: one to rent out, one to live in. And he just can't seem to do it, just can't seem to -- in other words, we make all kind of behavioral plans for him to -- and he does occasionally start getting rid of the accumulated things, but he starts and then stops. And so I'm questioning whether he really wants to be free of this habit. 

00:03:35
UNKNOWN Um-hum. So let's see if I understand. The way he would describe this is that he would, um, clean up these side-by-sides? 

00:03:50
RON Um-hum. 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN And that would be a -- the -- the main sign to him that things were better? 

00:03:55
RON Yes. Yes. 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN And for you, the sign that supervision got you what you wanted was that you would, um, have some fresh ideas? And then was there a piece about you would, um, have some indication in your mind about does he want what he says he wants? 

00:04:20
RON Yes. 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN Okay. I don't know if I can help you with the latter. 

00:04:30
RON Okay. 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN I mean, I -- I think the only person who really knows is your client there. 

00:04:35
RON Um-hum. 

00:04:35
UNKNOWN But I -- I hope maybe I can offer some ideas -- 

00:04:35
RON Sure. 

00:04:35
UNKNOWN -- with the other. Um, you already intrigued me, because, um, he started this a couple times, cleaning up. What do you -- how'd that happen? 

00:04:50
RON  Well, I've encouraged him. And I've done something that I don't usually do: It would not be like me at all to, uh, facilitate a home visit with a client. But there's a little hint here about what happened. And I think in the context of this supervision I'm going to tell you a story, and it's one of the stories that I heard in -- when I was in graduate school, and it was about therapeutic failure and it was about exactly the same kind of case. And the psychologist involved continued to work with the patient to try to get her to clean up her apartment. And after six months of therapy, nothing happened, until the landlord came in and said, 'I'm going to do my annual inspection.' The landlord did indeed do so, and made the threat of eviction, in which case the client cleaned up her entire apartment. And, uh, as a therapist, I know that I can't effect those -- all I can do is offer my theories; I can't effect those kind of circumstances. But there's a little hint here about maybe what I could do, and maybe you can give that form somehow. Um, the city came by my client's home and, uh, threatened him with a citation if he didn't clean up his grounds around his homes. And he could not do it, and he becomes anxious when he starts to throw things away. And, uh, so one of his neighbors came by and said 'I'll do that for you,' charged him a very minimal amount of money, cleaned up the entire grounds, and my client escaped citation. 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN Wow. 

00:06:35
RON So, just before that happened, when he was right in the throes of that, he asked me, and of course his home was very close to my office, he said, 'Why don't we do my therapy session at home today, and why don't you come over?' 

00:06:45
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:06:45
RON And so, you know, I made various suggestions to him about the grounds, you know, and what he could do. Someone did come and clean up, but he can't seem to move on the inside of the house. And, uh, at one point, you know, when we looked at his -- at the grounds around his home, I offered -- I said, 'Well, you know, now I want to go inside and see the rest of it.' And he talked about severe embarrassment, trepidation, didn't want me to see it. And of course when I went in, I mean, I did not literal -- I mean figuratively, I did not fall off my chair. You know, it's like it was what I expected it to be. And -- 

00:07:20
UNKNOWN Now, wait a second. I'm -- I'm lost here, because -- 

00:07:20
RON Sure. 

00:07:20
UNKNOWN -- he didn't want you to come in -- 

00:07:20
RON Well, he didn't want me to, but I -- 

00:07:20
UNKNOWN -- but then somehow it was okay ultimately that you came in? 

00:07:25
RON It was. I said -- 

00:07:25
UNKNOWN How'd that happen? 

00:07:25
RON I said, 'You know, I'm your therapist. I'm not going to be shocked by this. You've already told me about it. So, you know, no big deal.' 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN And he was reassured? 

00:07:35
RON And -- and then he said, 'Okay. So come on in.' And I didn't express any shock or anything like that. But once I got in, I started making suggestions to him about what he could do. But he'll only get so far and then that's it. 

00:07:50
UNKNOWN So, um, how has -- to what degree has making the suggestions worked with him? 

00:07:55
RON Not very well. 

00:07:55
UNKNOWN Okay. Okay. Um, what ha -- what are some of the things that have worked? Because it's interesting to me. I mean, he could have been kicked out of this apartment, and wasn't. 

00:08:05
RON Well, just like my little story case that I -- that I had in graduate school, the only thing that seems to work is some kind of threat, I mean, because basically the city threatened him and that worked. But I don't do threats; I'm a therapist. 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN Um-hum. Um-hum. 

00:08:20
RON You know, so -- I mean, the only thing I could really threaten is to terminate my relationship -- 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN Um-hum. 

00:08:25
RON -- with him. I have not yet done that, although I have entertained the idea. 

00:08:30
UNKNOWN Um-hum. So that's one thought you've had is maybe, um, raise the idea of, uh, firing yourself -- 

00:08:40
RON Um-hum. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN -- because you don't feel like you're -- 

00:08:40
RON Right. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN -- getting him what he wanted? 

00:08:40
RON Right. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN  Okay, so -- so that's one thought already. Um, anything else that -- 

00:08:50
RON There are some really significant factors about this client that may serve as adjuncts to the process. This is a -- um, a male. As I said, he is transgendered. So it's a man who has sex with men; although he hasn't done that for 12 years since the AIDS scare came to be. He was raised by a household of women: a grandmother, a mother, and, uh -- and an aunt that shared the apartment next door. Uh, Aunt is in the nursing home right now, and Mother is dead. Grandmother is, of course, deceased. And there's one little hint, and I don't -- I'm not sure exactly what to do with this; he said, um -- I asked him if anyone else in the family accumulated things like that, and he said, 'Yes. My mother.' 

00:09:40
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:09:40
RON And I was thinking that -- that this was the only thing left as -- as far as something that kept him connected to these very nurturing, very loving women, and that this was his way of continuing to maintain contact with his mom who accumulated thousands of recipe books, which he still has. 

00:10:10
UNKNOWN Um-hum. Um-hum. 

00:10:15
RON So I thought maybe, you know, initiating some type of a grief process, uh, in regard to his losses. Um, I've tried a little bit of that. He's very, very hesitant, very -- I -- I think it's there, but he's very hesitant to -- to really get into that at all. 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN He's hesitant to talk about his sadness, about his mom dying? 

00:10:40
RON Yes. 

00:10:40
UNKNOWN Um-hum. 

00:10:40
RON Yes. 

00:10:40
UNKNOWN Um-hum. Um, is there anything else you've tried that has, um, been helpful? 

00:10:45
RON Hmm. Not really, except, you know, cognitive behavioral things. What I've been trying to set up with him is kind of like a dream list of things that he'll be able to do, uh, when he gets these homes cleaned out: Number one, he can get rent from one side, which would be good. Number two, he would have room to move around. He -- he could entertain again. 

00:11:15
UNKNOWN Does he like to entertain? 

00:11:15
RON He -- well, he said, 'You know, I'd like to have sex again someday. He said, 'But I wouldn't- -- 

00:11:20
UNKNOWN Well, that takes some room, and -- 

00:11:20
RON Well, he said, 'I wouldn't think of having someone into my house' -- 

00:11:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:11:25
RON -- you know -- 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN Sure. 

00:11:25
RON -- 'looking like this.' 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, he'd be embarrassed. Yeah. 

00:11:25
RON So I said, 'You know, you can be intimate again, and we can talk about safer sex so you don't have to be so afraid of AIDS. And there's all kind of things we can do.' So what I've tried to do is create some incentives. 

00:11:35
UNKNOWN Some incentives, yeah. No? 

00:11:40
RON Not strong enough. 

00:11:40
UNKNOWN Not strong enough. And tell me again, um, what he would say was a sign that he got what he wanted and needed in therapy. 

00:11:55
RON  That he was able to clean out his house. 

00:12:00
UNKNOWN So that's the bottom line? 

00:12:00
RON It's what he wants. 

00:12:00
UNKNOWN Um-hum. Um-hum. And these others are more positive -- at least in our minds, positive side effects of that? 

00:12:10
RON Um-hum. Right. 

00:12:10
UNKNOWN Okay. And, um -- hmm. Tell me how it happened that he started that before. What did you and he talk about that preceded that? 

00:12:25
RON As far as the OCD is concerned? 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, well, that he started doing some cleaning. That's interesting to me. 

00:12:30
RON Hmm. Basically it was the incentive thing: 'This is what you'll be able to do.' So he would go home and do little bits. I mean, I even made very specific plans. I said, 'You know, you can go and get the extremely resilient trash bags, you can do one a week, and in 52 weeks' -- I mean, we've, you know, kind of planned it out. And then the other thing that I was thinking too, and this is another -- another problem, is that there could be a huge double bind for him here. And it's one of these double binds that's created by someone coming into therapy. If he gets the house cleaned out, he will have to give up at some point the person that he speaks to most intimately about his life. 

00:13:20
UNKNOWN That's you. Is it you? 

00:13:20
RON That's me. 

00:13:20
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:13:20
RON There is no one else. He works in a way that's very -- works in one of the hotels; very isolated, no personal contact with anybody. So he would have to give up the intimacy of the therapy, because I'm the one that he talks to about his plans for gender change. No one else knows about this. I'm the one that he does his dreaming with, as far as what it will be like when it's all fixed. But I also realize that I'm the only one. 

00:13:55
UNKNOWN That makes sense. 

00:13:55
RON And it's a horrific double bind because if he does what we're planning for him to do, uh, he will no longer have this connection with anything that's in any way conversationally intimate. 

00:14:10
UNKNOWN Hmm. Hmm. I'm kind of -- I'm hearing two kind of parallel thoughts there, I think, that you're having: One is, uh, about maintaining the connection with his mom who also did this, and you're also having a thought about, um, connection with you. Have you talked with him about either of these ideas? 

00:14:30
RON Actually, I haven't talked with him about the idea of giving therapy up. In fact, that's an idea that came into my consciousness as you and I were talking right now. 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN So that's one idea. 

00:14:45
RON Um-hum. 

00:14:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:14:50
RON This is the first moment that the double bind really came to me. And trust me, I have staffed this case with my staff. 

00:14:55
UNKNOWN Um-hum. Um-hum. So is there anything else that comes to mind that's been helping even a little bit what you and he has been doing -- 

00:15:05
RON Just -- 

00:15:05
UNKNOWN -- he have been doing? 

00:15:10
RON -- tiny little behavioral steps. 

00:15:10
UNKNOWN Tell me about those. 

00:15:10
RON Uh, 'You can throw away a pile a week.' And what he's afraid of is that -- his fear is that he'll throw something away and it will have been something that he wanted to read or connect with. And for somebody that is so completely isolated and alone, other than having therapy, the only ting he has, so to speak, as his friends are the connection to literature, I mean, whatever it is that he prefers, newspaper, uh, articles that would have to do with his gender change, and so on and so forth. That's the next big thing. So, in other words, basically those things are both a curse and a comfort -- 

00:15:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:15:50
RON -- at the same time, which is more or less a continuation of the double bind. 

00:15:55
UNKNOWN Well, and it sounds like you have compassion for that. 

00:16:00
RON I do. 

00:16:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:16:00
RON I do. 

00:16:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. It's interesting, uh, the double bind, something that came to mind. 

00:16:10
RON Right now. 

00:16:10
UNKNOWN Has your compassion for him grown? 

00:16:10
RON  Actually, it has. Uh, there was a big change in my compassion for him when I went over and saw the house and, uh, what a horrific struggle it must be for him to be in this situation, to have all those things as his best friends, you know, and -- and not be able to throw them out, yet to have such a driving need to want to, to free up his life, to be social and to have a clean house. 

00:16:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:16:45
RON You know? 

00:16:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. I-- I think I might be hearing yet another thing that kind of fits the double-bind idea; I don't know. Uh, it sounds like, um, he, um, wants you to help him, but when you tell him what to do, um, he doesn't do it? Or does he do it a little bit? 

00:17:05
RON Teeny little bits. 

00:17:05
UNKNOWN He does it a little bit? 

00:17:05
RON Then he stops. 

00:17:05
UNKNOWN Um-hum. Um-hum. 

00:17:10
RON Just small amounts. 

00:17:10
UNKNOWN From, um, the amounts he does, what do you think's working? I mean, he could just do nothing. What do -- what do you think makes him able to do what he is doing -- 

00:17:25
RON I would have to -- 

00:17:25
UNKNOWN -- that little bit of progress? 

00:17:25
RON I would have to say it's the motivators -- 

00:17:25
UNKNOWN  The motivators. 

00:17:30
RON -- we've created. I would say that it's, you know, the dreams he has about having a clean house, being social. 

00:17:35
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. Well, it makes sense. I mean, if you're going to want to give up something, you want something instead. And the more you describe it to me, I mean, you can see how he'd feel that way. 

00:17:45
RON Right. The other thing about this client that's coming clear to me as I talk with you is how much fantasy is a part of his life. And it's fantasy about his gender change, but it's -- and it's fantasy about, you know, being freed up. But there's so much fantasy because he's so alone. 

00:18:10
UNKNOWN Hmm. Um-hum. 

00:18:10
RON So he seems to live -- other than the times he's connecting in therapy or, you know, just doing very small interactions like with a mechanic that fixes his car, and so on and so forth, there's very little concrete interaction. He goes to work, does his job in an isolated way, comes home. So a great deal of fantasy around his life. 

00:18:30
UNKNOWN Um-hum. Um-hum. Okay. Um, Ron, if we go on the direction of, um, your idea of the -- the motivators, in other words, imagining the good things, um, if we -- we could make that, um -- those good things bigger, uh, what effect, if any, do you think that would have? 

00:19:00
RON I think it would have a major effect. 

00:19:05
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:19:05
RON And, um, you know, I've been very hesitant to do trans with him -- 

00:19:10
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:19:10
RON -- and it's because there's so many impediments and so many things about this case. And I need to say that I've had a great deal of success in treating OCD through trans, but I've been very hesitant to get into that in this case, because there seems to be so much surrounding him, you know, that serves as impediments. 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN Well, also, um, I've got a couple thoughts on that. 

00:19:40
RON Um-hum. 

00:19:40
UNKNOWN Um, my -- my belief, from having done supervision for about 20 years now, is that when the therapist has a reluctance to do something, usually it's because it's not what they should be doing. 

00:19:50
RON Right. 

00:19:55
UNKNOWN Uh, I -- I tend -- just as I tend to believe that my clients know something, I tend to know that my colleagues do too. So -- so my first reaction is you must be on to something, is what I'm guessing; I don't know that. Uh, my second reaction is, uh, okay, what is trans but not trans? And I've got a couple ideas based on what you've said. Um, is there anything else you want to tell me before we kind of talk about some possible ideas? 

00:20:25
RON Can't think of anything. 

00:20:25
UNKNOWN Okay, I have to ask you one more thing. 

00:20:30
RON Sure. 

00:20:30
UNKNOWN What would he say you're doing right? 

00:20:30
RON Hmm. What he would revel in would be the sense of connection -- 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN Sense of connection. 

00:20:40
RON -- and, uh -- and empathy that he's able to experience in therapy; uh, loves coming to therapy, just loves it. 

00:20:55
UNKNOWN What difference would he say that makes for him? 

00:20:55
RON Hmm. Gosh, I mean, words just coming into mind -- my mind is that -- that a sense of connection for him is almost like life and death. 

00:21:10
UNKNOWN Wow. That's big. 

00:21:15
RON I really think that it gives him life, because, as I said earlier, other than talking to the mechanic who fixes his car, he's in a complete world of illusion and fantasy. And so therapy really breathes life and animation into his -- into his being -- 

00:21:40
UNKNOWN Wow. 

00:21:40
RON -- because there's no one else now. Everyone else that hurt his feelings or connected with him in a personal way is either dead of extremely infirm at this point in time. And every once in a while, through his wisdom, he'll look at me and say, 'Well, remember, now, I was an only child.' 

00:22:00
UNKNOWN Wow. 

00:22:00
RON So whatever that means to him, he was -- he was the focus of three absolutely doting wonderful women. He was their life. 

00:22:10
UNKNOWN Wow, and then to have that not there -- 

00:22:15
RON Right. 

00:22:15
UNKNOWN What would you say he's doing right? 

00:22:20
RON He's making attempts, which is something he didn't do before. 

00:22:25
UNKNOWN Tell me more about those attempts, because it sounds like -- 

00:22:25
RON Well -- 

00:22:25
UNKNOWN -- it's important. 

00:22:30
RON -- he -- he'll take little piles of -- of newspapers and articles, and he will go through them and sort them, save little things; but only very sporadically, not in a predictable way. Um, sometimes he'll come into his therapy session and say -- he'll say, 'I did this much.' 

00:22:45
UNKNOWN He will? 

00:22:45
RON Yeah. It -- but it doesn't put a dent. 

00:22:50
UNKNOWN Sure, but it's something. 

00:22:50
RON It's something, right. 

00:22:50
UNKNOWN Any, um -- any idea what on Earth would need to happen for that to continue? 

00:23:00
RON  You know, as you're working with me, there's only one thought that comes to my mind, and it's about the idea that I had shortly after I sat down with you: I need to process the double bind with him. 

00:23:15
UNKNOWN Hmm. That's interesting to me. Um, any thoughts of how you would do that? I can give you some ideas, but I'm curious about your ideas, because you're actually with the client. 

00:23:30
RON Um, you know, I'm a pretty down-to-earth guy, and probably what I'm going to say to him, 'Be damned if you don't, and be damned if you do,' and take it from there and just let him go into that process and without being -- you know, staying centered and focused in myself, you know, without going over into the codependency thing, to let him know that therapy is always there for him and that it's not going to disappear when he makes this change. 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN Um-hum. Um-hum. 

00:24:05
RON It's something we haven't talked about. 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN Hmm. Um-hum. Um-hum. So your sense is letting him know you're there for him? 

00:24:15
RON And, you know, as we talk, there's -- there's one little interchange that I had with him that's really starting to make sense as we talk, as my process becomes unveiled. Several weeks ago when he came into his therapy session, you know, I was just kind of poking at the double-bind thing and I said, 'You know, I don't know if there's anything more I can do for you.' And he looked at me and very indignantly said, 'What do you mean? This is all I have.' 

00:24:45
UNKNOWN Wow. 

00:24:50
RON So, to reassure him, you know, that therapy's always there for him, that he may not always need it in the frequency that he does, but that -- that growth can take many turns and that, during those turns, he might need to be in therapy. 

00:25:05
UNKNOWN Has reassuring him been helpful in the past? 

00:25:10
RON You know, I haven't really put it into good verbiage, you know? I simply make the next appointment and we go from there. And I think it needs to be talked about at a greater depth. 

00:25:20
UNKNOWN So you have a hunch it would be helpful? 

00:25:25
RON You know what's really ringing clear to me as we talk is the double bind. 

00:25:30
UNKNOWN Okay. Um, do you want some ideas vis-à-vis the double bind? 

00:25:35
RON I do. 

00:25:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:25:35
RON I'd love to have some ideas. 

00:25:35
UNKNOWN Um, well, I wrote down what has come to me, and -- and I'm just going to, uh, put it out for you, and you can pick and choose among that and see if there's any of it that fits for you. Um, the first thing, uh, that came to mind for me was, um -- I was listening to this description of all his stuff, and, uh, the embarrassment of people coming in and the fact that, um, you know, he -- he -- he reminds you that, you know, he's -- was an only child and -- and people he's loved have -- have passed on, and also he's contemplating this pretty big life change. I guess I would want to know how's he managing to the degree he is. It's a lot to be handling. 

00:26:25
RON Hmm. 

00:26:25
UNKNOWN And also kind of an appreciative question about, you know, 'How are you managing,' 'How -- how come it's not worse,' uh, 'How are you carrying on,' and -- and -- and -- and I guess, along with that, in terms of this -- all this stuff, there is a path through, how has he managed to preserve that. 

00:26:45
RON  You know, it's -- it's -- it is rather interesting. Again, as we talk, I did see a change -- 

00:26:55
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:26:55
RON -- in his willingness, after I did the site visit. 

00:27:00
UNKNOWN Interesting. So there's something helpful about the site visit. 

00:27:05
RON That seemed to make a difference. 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN And -- and can you tell me what happened with his willingness and -- and -- 

00:27:10
RON Well, that's when he started, you know, doing the little piles -- 

00:27:10
UNKNOWN Really? 

00:27:10
RON -- so to speak. It's, like, right after I was there. I mean, it's -- it's a five-minute walk from the office. I mean, it's nothing, you know, for me to go there. And, uh, that seemed to -- the fact that I didn't condemn him in any way or shame him or appear shocked, I think, made a huge difference to him. 

00:27:35
UNKNOWN Um-hum. Um-hum. That's really interesting. 

00:27:40
RON Yeah. 

00:27:40
UNKNOWN So there's something -- you have a hunch about that. That's something you've done that's worked, in addition to the other things. Um, so I'm very curious about finding out how he's managed to do those piles instead of doing nothing, how -- how he's prevented it from being worse. 

00:27:55
RON Okay. 

00:27:55
RON  Um, I'm also -- um, given what he's been going through that he's described to you and what you call the double bind - and that's the way you and I are thinking of it, whether he calls it that or not - still, he's got a lot going on. And so, um, I would be interested in complimenting him: 'You've got a lot going on, but you're carrying on. You're managing to keep this at bay to some degree, to the degree you can walk through. You're able to have somebody come in, uh, and set up this thing on the TV. You didn't let this fear take over to that degree. You were able to do that.' And, um, I like -- I learned this from my friend, Insoo Kim Berg, and I like to ask people how they did that, how they managed to do it. And even if he just says, 'Well, I just did it,' I still want to ask how, because usually that'll get him to -- to compliment himself some. 

00:28:55
RON Sure. 

00:29:00
UNKNOWN So that's one idea. Um, I've got two other ideas. And between you and me, I have a hierarchy of offering the simplest things to the client first, and the least intrusive things first, because I believe it's a lot easier to make things more complicated than it is to make them more simple. So I start with the simplest. Um, another idea would be, um, more in the trans idea, trans but not trans. And, uh, do you know anything about the history of solution-focused therapy? 

00:29:35
RON No. 

00:29:35
UNKNOWN Oh, good. Okay, then I can tell you. Um, there were a lot of influences on that. Uh, two of my teachers, um, who, uh, founded that were, um, Insoo Kim Berg and Steve de Shazer, and they were very intrigued at one point with Milton Erickson's crystal ball where, uh, Dr. Erickson would have, uh, the client, uh, hallucinate a series of crystal balls in which, um, either there were very productive sessions that took place or there was a solution the client would not have previously been able to contemplate. And, um, the home of solution-focused brief therapy is Wisconsin. Have you spent much time in the Midwest? 

00:30:25
RON No. 

00:30:25
UNKNOWN Well, it's interesting. I've spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and I spent a lot of time where Dr. Erickson grew up, because I used to work at a mental-health center in that area. And, uh, it's a very down-to-earth kind of place. And, uh, what -- what Steve de Shazer and Insoo Kim Berg did is they followed the idea of asking -- or trying to create a space where the client could imagine something that was previously unimaginable, not unlike the crystal ball, only in their case they did it by inviting the client to imagine a miracle. And, um, where that came from, actually, was, uh, a client was at her wit's end and, uh, if I recall the case, she'd lost her home, her job and her family. So she's pretty much alone like your client, very alone. And, um, my -- my friend Insoo was a young therapist at the time and -- and just felt really sad for this client and just asked her, 'Is there anything that would help at all?' And the client says, 'Well, it would take a miracle.' And she said, 'Well, let's suppose there was a miracle. What would be different?' And maybe with this client, sort of a trans but not trans, because I think it -- I think that question, if it's done right -- and, boy, if it's not done right, the client can't answer it. And I think that's something that can be learned but not taught. But you're an experienced-enough clinician. I think you would know how to do it right. But the way you ask it is you ask the client to imagine, if that problem was gone, what would be different. And as a substitute for the -- or an alternative for the crystal ball, we ask, traditionally in solution-focused therapy, by, um, asking, um, 'Well, let's suppose that tonight you went home and you got ready for bed and you did the things you would normally do and, um, you eventually fell asleep.' Is this guy a good sleeper? 

00:32:40
RON Yes. 

00:32:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:32:40
RON Yes. 

00:32:40
UNKNOWN So I -- I would -- you know, I would kind of put that in too, 'And it was a good sleep, let's imagine. And sometime during that night, uh, something happened; it was a miracle and this wasn't a problem anymore. But when you woke up, the problem was gone, but you didn't know it because you were asleep. What would you notice first?' Well, of course he's going to tell you, I think, that all this stuff is gone. But that's the least of your work, because you're going to have to, I think -- if you want to use that approach, you would want to find out, so what would he be doing differently and, uh, if that stuff was gone, um, would he be inviting friends in. And it's interesting to me, because you've been doing a lot of that, about -- you said the motivation. 

00:33:30
RON Right. 

00:33:35
UNKNOWN Um, would he be, um, doing -- what else would he be doing -- 

00:33:40
RON Well, he would be -- 

00:33:40
UNKNOWN -- that he said? 

00:33:40
RON -- moving ahead with his gender change. 

00:33:40
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:33:40
RON And, see, one of my theories with him also is that that's something that he only -- there's no doubt in my mind that he is transgendered. Uh, at this point, I've known him long enough to -- to ascertain that, but that he only wants to keep it in fantasy, that the process is too scary for him. And that's one of the things that I've suggested to him. In other words, by keeping everything in its place, he doesn't have to go through with the rest of the process. I mean, there's certain things he's done. Like, he's gone in and had his beard removed, uh, with laser, and so on and so forth. 

00:34:15
UNKNOWN  That's the major thing to do. 

00:34:20
RON It is. It is. But what I've insinuated to him is that he's too afraid to go the rest of the way and that by keeping everything in place in the house -- that he doesn't have to -- 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN Has -- 

00:34:35
RON -- that he's too fearful. 

00:34:35
UNKNOWN Has it been helpful to insinuate that to him? 

00:34:35
RON I would say yes -- 

00:34:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:34:40
RON -- because it takes -- 

00:34:40
UNKNOWN So it's been helpful. 

00:34:40
RON -- him into a place of process where he can say either yes or no, it is or it isn't, and, uh, spend a session, you know, talking about his answer and what it means to him. So I think it's been very helpful. 

00:34:50
UNKNOWN So that something that's been helpful. 

00:34:50
RON Right. 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN Um, so the trans part would be more about continuing to get more details to make the motivation stronger. But then I'm hearing sort of an ecology to this, uh, about, um, your hunch is it's not good for him to go too fast, it's been helpful to take some time. So that makes me think of two other things, and, again, I'll just offer these to you: Um, one is, in solution-focused therapy, we have something called a pessimistic question sequence. And I've added the tiniest little bit to that, and I'll tell you what it is: Uh, we ask the client, if things don't seem to be getting better -- and I'm not sure they're not getting better, to be honest, as I listen to you. Uh, he's made a path, he's got it stabilized, it's not getting worse, he's, um, taking his time with this, and he's getting something from you, um, is what I'm hearing. But anyway, here's a question we sometimes use, and the question is, um -- and -- and we usually preface it by saying, 'This is kind of a funny question, but is there any -- would there be any disadvantage to things getting better? Because,' and this is the part I've added, 'if so, it would be important for us to find some way to preserve that advantage while making whatever movement you think is appropriate.' So it's not one of those "nah-nah" secondary game questions where -- where I feel like we're blaming the client, you know. It's more like, is there -- um, is there some advantage? And it sounds like your hunch is there -- there are some. And it might be interesting to ask him, um, and, you know, um, he might say, 'Well, I'll lose my relationship with you,' or he might say -- from what you've told me, your hunch is it's too fast. 

00:36:50
RON Right. 

00:36:50
UNKNOWN And I think that -- um, I call that way of thinking "the client has a good reason" way of thinking. So I might ask him if there is some advantage or some good reason for going slow. 

00:37:05
RON The sense that I have is that one little thing has to break, and I can't quite put my finger on it. 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:37:15
RON That's just my feeling. 

00:37:20
UNKNOWN Well, maybe it's because it's, um, something that has to come from the client. Uh -- 

00:37:25
RON Indeed. 

00:37:25
UNKNOWN -- there's, um, yet one more idea. Now, I like -- I like that miracle idea because it seems to be going in my idea. My idea here is in the direction of the motivation that's been working. So that's one way. Um, another way you could ask that is what other people would notice him doing differently, without him saying a word, if, uh, that problem was gone. Um, but then there's something that might be nice, because you've got an idea about the importance of it not going too fast for him, because maybe in a sense he's afraid. And, um, frankly, I don't believe in resistance, and it's -- it's not because I think resistance doesn't exist. But in the tradition of solution-focused therapy, um, we, um, believe that, uh, each client has their own unique way of cooperating, and resisting is one of them. And so I like to assume that, um, if the client is not responding, uh, they've got a good reason and maybe I'm going too fast, or maybe it's the wrong thing, or maybe I haven't asked the right questions. And, uh, what I really like already that you -- you do with him is you're not saying he's, uh, lazy or mean or bad; you're -- you're saying that there's probably something going on with him, so there's kind of a good reason. 

00:39:00
RON Right. 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN  Maybe scaling would be nice for him, in that scaling sometimes allows a person to feel less overwhelmed. And you're kind of going in that direction. You have these nice behavioral steps, but they were specific. So maybe something less specific; I don't know. Or maybe they were too big. 

00:39:25
RON Can -- can you tell me more about that, "less specific"? 

00:39:25
UNKNOWN Well, uh, here's my idea, and -- and it's not going to be of much use, so -- unless you, um, put it through the filter of your own knowledge and your own style and make it a response to that client. But, um, the fact that it hasn't gotten worse. You know, he has a path tells me something. So -- and he's made some forays. So I -- I guess I would do something like I would make a scale and, um, at one end is he's -- and I would attach to that some of the things he wants: He's seeing friends, uh, it's cleaned to a degree that he's happy, you know, um, and whatever else he thought was important, we would put that at the 10. Now, my shorthand way of doing that is the miracle question. 

00:40:20
RON Sure. 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN But you do it how you do it. And then at the other end, things were the worst they've ever been. And I'd find out where he was now, and I'd find out what he's doing to maintain that so it's not going downhill. 

00:40:35
RON One of the things that I may be doing, and -- and this is unconscious with me, is I'm going from black to white and -- and, you know, omitting the gray areas, and -- because I have this vision when he comes into therapy and says, 'I really do want it cleaned out;' I see this -- now I -- I can actually identify with the space. So I see the space all cleaned out and maybe I'm going too fast. That could be part of what it is. Then I'm -- just through my own visualization, I've created expectations that are too high. 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN  What would your hunch be, Ron, of what would be, um, uh, a way that you could go slower, if you think that's useful? 

00:41:20
RON Hmm. Maybe to set a goal that it doesn't all have to be done, that that doesn't necessarily even have to be the perceived end result, but that it has to be more livable in some way. 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN Hmm. It'd be interesting to -- to see what he would think about that. 

00:41:40
RON Right. 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN So, you know, for example, if a 10 was, um, it was livable for him, as opposed to a 10 was it was completely cleaned, I wonder where he'd say he was now. And, uh, I'm fascinated by the fact that it doesn't seem to be getting worse. 

00:41:55
RON  It's not getting worse. In fact -- 

00:42:00
UNKNOWN He's doing something right. 

00:42:00
RON -- this much better. You know, at -- at -- at infrequent intervals, this much -- 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN Wow. 

00:42:05
RON -- goes away. 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN Wow. 

00:42:05
RON But, I mean, to paint the picture, and we're talking about a house -- 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:42:10
RON -- full -- 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe asking him some questions -- something I do sometimes when my clients appear overwhelmed, um, and -- and this -- I don't know if this will fit for you or not, because it's, um -- I've always had to battle in myself, uh, a tendency to appear too positive or too much like a cheerleader; it's my kind of sunny, Midwestern, chronic optimistic personality, so I don't know if this would fit for you. But one of the things I sometimes ask clients is to tell me where they are now and, as I said, to tell me what they're doing to maintain. And then sometimes I ask them to make a line on that little scale, if I made a scale, as close in the positive direction as they can make it to where they are now, and to tell me, if they could, what would be the tiniest thing that would make any indication that they were going forward. 

00:43:20
RON Good. 

00:43:20
UNKNOWN And I ask them what they would think about trying that. Or is that -- is that too much? 

00:43:25
RON No, I think that's good, and I think it takes away the black/white, you know, uh, mentality that I've been approaching this with. The other thing is that, for a bit of time here, I've been kind of angry with myself because I've had such wonderful results treating OCD. I mean, I've -- in fact, I'm -- I am considered one of the only people in our community that can do it. 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN So you're good at it. 

00:43:50
RON I'm good at it. I do it with Ericksonian methods, I do it with trans, I do it with hypnosis. And, I mean, people have brought to me the worst cases of ruminative OCD, you know, of people that sit all day long and ruminate that they've been on disability for five years. I can do it. I can do it through trans. I mean, I can take them from that ruminative, almost near catatonic state, to working 12 hours a day and being productive. But I have not been able to effect this like I want to, and so I'm kind of disappointed in myself. 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN Are you feeling less disappointed in yourself as a result of our conversation? 

00:44:30
RON Actually, yes. 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN Good. 

00:44:35
RON Yes, I am, because I think the most significant thing that -- that gelled in my mind today was the existence of the double bind -- 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. 

00:44:45
RON -- that that for me is very real. 

00:44:45
UNKNOWN Um-hum. Um-hum. 

00:44:50
RON So I appreciate that. 

00:44:55
UNKNOWN Well, I want to -- I want to compliment you on, first of all, how dedicated you are to your client, because you've thought a lot about this. And I also hear a lot of compassion, and that's a value I have. I just really think that -- 

00:45:05
RON Well, I'm very fortunate -- 

00:45:05
UNKNOWN -- it's a really important thing. 

00:45:05
RON -- because I work in an environment where that's how we think. 

00:45:10
UNKNOWN Hmm. Hmm. Thank you for helping me demonstrate this. 

00:45:15
RON Thank you very much. It's been very helpful. 

00:45:20
UNKNOWN Great. Great. 

00:45:25
[sil.] 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN Thank you. Okay. I think we just have a short amount of time, but maybe we could take a question or two, if there are any. And if there are any, I -- I guess I'd have to ask you to walk up to the mic. 

00:45:50
[sil.] 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN And it may be that there aren't any questions. Okay. Well, yes, you have to go to the mic, if you'd be so kind. 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN That was wonderful. Thank you, um, for the demonstration. In, uh, the company I work for, we have hired, uh, peer supports, and they're individuals, um, who have been diagnosed with mental-health issues, um, but they are staff, um, now as well as consumers. Um, we've had some difficulty with their supervision. Um, do you have any ideas? Lots of boundary issues when they're working at some of our -- with residential facilities; things like that. Do you have any helpful hints in supervising, um, peer supports? 

00:46:50
UNKNOWN In supervising peer supports? 

00:46:55
UNKNOWN In other words, we have clients working as staff. 

00:46:55
UNKNOWN Working as staff? Clients working as staff? 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN Um-hum, in our facilities. And they -- they're requiring supervision due to things like boundary issues and, um -- 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN -- other problems that come up in their interactions with fellow clients. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN Well, I have a feeling that there's a lot to this, um, but the -- the -- the -- the short answer -- the best short answer I could give you is, um, to catch them doing something right and compliment them on it, and also to set up some structures where they can find out from their clients, their peers, what is helpful, what they're doing that's helpful. And, um, if they find out that things aren't helpful, well, okay, that's not -- that's not what to do more of. But if they -- and I'm sure they are doing some things that are helpful -- uh, to -- to help them identify what they're doing right and -- and by getting some consensus from their clients. 

00:48:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:48:05
UNKNOWN  And, um, another idea I might have, that I've used at times when I've done peer support groups, is to have the activity of the different peers make a solution-focused scale that's signs of process. Uh, sometimes a group has, for example, come up with the idea that being able to, um, talk about the problem is progress; so is being able to talk about things other than the problem. Sometimes they've come up with ideas about, um, being able to, um, accept praise. I mean, they come up with a lot of ideas of how they as a group know that someone, namely themselves, are going forward. So that'd be another idea. 

00:48:55
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:48:55
UNKNOWN Thanks. I think we're out of time. I want to wish everybody a great rest of the conference. 

00:49:05
