University of Manchester Department of Psychiatry Video Assisted Seminars in Behavioural Psychotherapy John Cobb 

00:00:00
JOHN COBB  You're about to take a part in a video-assisted seminar. In order to allow for discussion, when the following caption appears,- 

00:00:15
Discussion Point 

00:00:15
JOHN COBB - I'd like you to stop the tape and to discuss the issue raised among yourselves. Today, we're gonna look at behavioural psychotherapy, and we're gonna cover straightforward techniques. 

00:00:25
1. Straightforward Work in Behavioural Psychotherapy John Cobb and Shirley Mercer 

00:00:25
JOHN COBB  You'll see me treating a patient with obsessional and phobic problems, and in this tape you'll see me using a number standard techniques. I'd like you to see how many of these techniques you can recognize. 

00:00:45
JOHN COBB Oh hello, Frances. 

00:00:45
FRANCES  Hi. 

00:00:50
JOHN COBB Nice to see you again. 

00:00:50
FRANCES Thanks. 

00:00:50
JOHN COBB How are you feeling? 

00:00:50
FRANCES Uhm, not bad. 

00:00:55
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. One of the things that I'd like to start with is deciding what we're gonna talk about during the session. 

00:01:00
FRANCES Uh-huh. 

00:01:00
JOHN COBB Ah, have you got things in particular to talk about? 

00:01:05
FRANCES No, I don't think so. 

00:01:05
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. Sure? Okay. Well, there are number of things that I want to include in this session. And the first thing, I think, is look at the diary that you did. (crosstalk) 

00:01:20
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:01:20
JOHN COBB I noticed that you filled it in. 

00:01:20
FRANCES Yeah. Ah. (crosstalk) 

00:01:20
JOHN COBB  Could you tell me anything that you noticed, that struck you about, about the diary? 

00:01:25
FRANCES  Well, you asked me to record when I had the urge to go and wash my hands, when I got very anxious. And I've done that. I did it in a number of occasions. I didn't do it every time because there were too many times. 

00:01:40
JOHN COBB Yeah, were you able to measure the urge? How, how intense it was? 

00:01:40
FRANCES  Well, it got pretty bad, yeah. It felt very bad. It felt so bad that I had to go and wash my hands. I couldn't not do it. 

00:01:50
JOHN COBB Did you put a score on it or, (crosstalk) 

00:01:50
FRANCES Yeah, Yeah. 

00:01:50
JOHN COBB I remember, a note to rate on the scale. You, you did that? 

00:01:55
FRANCES Yeah, I sort of went up to 7 and 8... (crosstalk) 

00:01:55
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. 

00:01:55
FRANCES ...on most of the times, really, when I, when I recorded it. And stayed up at that time for a long time. 

00:02:05
JOHN COBB Let's pick a particular instance when it was bad for you. 

00:02:10
FRANCES I think the worst one was when the milkman came. Normally, Austin(ph) pays the milkman and, 'coz he wasn't there and the milkman came and I went to pay him. And I opened the door, and then I went to give him some money. He had to give me change and I started thinking that he could have touched some rubbish, or a black plastic bag, or something like that. Or maybe some other person had touched the bag before he gave him the money and then he was giving me the money. So that money was contaminated. Or that maybe he touched those, you know, the orange cartons that milkmen sell with pint-filled amount. I hope maybe he then, he'd been handling those in the morning. And then touched me, and of course the money I had in my hands then, and ah, 

00:02:55
JOHN COBB So, it was not only seeing the milkman. It was also thinking about the milkman actually. (crosstalk) 

00:03:00
FRANCES Yeah. And I started thinking that I was contaminated then and (sigh) I just had to go and wash my hands. And that it, I just felt quite bad. I felt really bad. 

00:03:10
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. It looks to me as though you're feeling really bad right now. 

00:03:10
FRANCES  It, just thinking about it is making me feel bad again. 

00:03:15
JOHN COBB You're feeling really bad. 

00:03:15
JOHN COBB  At this point, the patient's getting so anxious that she's making further work, work difficult.- 

00:03:25
Discussion point 

00:03:25
JOHN COBB - What would you do in these circumstances? 

00:03:25
FRANCES  I'm really beginning to feel dreadful, you know, Dr. Cobb. I don't know if I can stay. (sigh) 

00:03:35
JOHN COBB Yeah. And look, you know, the door is open. You, you can leave, if you want to. I, I would like you to try and stay if you can. Could you just try and stay for, perhaps, another other minute. 

00:03:45
FRANCES Well. I'll try, but ah, I really am feeling uptight at the moment. (crosstalk) 

00:03:55
JOHN COBB Hmm, tell me how bad it is on our scale. 

00:03:55
FRANCES  (sigh) It's, I hate, it's actually more than hate. 

00:04:00
JOHN COBB It's, it's went over the top of the scale. (crosstalk) 

00:04:00
FRANCES Yeah, Yeah. 

00:04:00
JOHN COBB Okay. Tell me exactly what you're feeling. Just describe it to me. 

00:04:05
FRANCES Well, my heart going mad. (coughs) I can hear it. It's sort of, it's palpating a bit, (crosstalk) 

00:04:10
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. 

00:04:10
FRANCES like when it's pounding. My mouth is dry. My hands are sweating. I feel a bit sick. I feel like I want to go to loo, (sigh) (crosstalk) 

00:04:20
JOHN COBB All right. 

00:04:20
FRANCES you know, and so I might faint. (crosstalk) 

00:04:20
JOHN COBB  Uh hmm. 

00:04:25
FRANCES I feel hot, clearly. 

00:04:25
JOHN COBB Anything going through your mind, particularly? (crosstalk) 

00:04:30
FRANCES Yeah, I feel stupid. I'm thinking you probably think I'm stupid. 

00:04:30
JOHN COBB  Uh hmm. 

00:04:35
FRANCES And I think I'm going to collapse. I'm thinking(ph), I'm actually going to faint.(sigh) 

00:04:35
JOHN COBB  What do you think is actually happening inside your body at the moment? 

00:04:45
FRANCES I'm panicking and... (crosstalk) 

00:04:45
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. 

00:04:45
FRANCES  sort of half-remember you saying something about adrenaline. 

00:04:50
JOHN COBB Do you remember the book that book that you read? (crosstalk) 

00:04:55
FRANCES Uh hmm. 

00:04:55
JOHN COBB Remember what that said? 

00:04:55
FRANCES (sigh) Just that when you're anxious that there's more adrenaline going around. And when there's more adrenaline, you start getting things like sweating and... (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. 

00:05:05
FRANCES ...heart racing, and things like that.(sigh) 

00:05:10
JOHN COBB  And what's gonna happen if you stay with it, do you think? 

00:05:15
FRANCES  Well, I know that if I stay long enough, that it would come down. I was told that I would be able to stay long enough. (crosstalk) 

00:05:25
JOHN COBB And you would have lasted out, yeah. Let's look at some of the techniques that we've mentioned so far. We mentioned in the first session one or two techniques that you might use to bring it down so you can cope with it. Can, can you recall any of the things that we've discussed? 

00:05:40
FRANCES Well, yes, we'd practiced the relaxation. 

00:05:40
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. 

00:05:40
FRANCES  But it just doesn't seem to work that well. I've tried it before anyway, I've tried when I used to go to yoga classes and it doesn't really help that much when I'm feeling as bad as this. It sort of, (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. 

00:05:55
FRANCES it only helps if I'm feeling fairly relaxed in the first place or fairly calm because I just can't concentrate on the tape, you know, can't keep, even with the headphones on. I just find that I'm still feeling these, sort of sensations. 

00:06:05
JOHN COBB  Right. So, relaxation isn't that, that helpful for you. (crosstalk) 

00:06:10
FRANCES No. 

00:06:10
JOHN COBB What others things did we mentioned? 

00:06:15
FRANCES We sort of talked about saying that this will pass, that it's irrational. Nothing worse is gonna happen. (crosstalk) 

00:06:25
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. And, how bad can it get in tonight? 

00:06:25
FRANCES  I suppose I still fear that it might get worst, even though it's... (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
JOHN COBB Or even worse than it is. (crosstalk) 

00:06:35
FRANCES ...even worse. 

00:06:35
JOHN COBB Do you think that's possible, really? 

00:06:35
FRANCES oh, might. I might faint. 

00:06:35
JOHN COBB  Yeah. 

00:06:40
FRANCES And I know I never have, although the evidence says I've fainted before. 

00:06:45
JOHN COBB So, you could be saying to yourself "I felt like this before and nothing disastrous has in fact never happened and I have always got through it" (crosstalk) 

00:06:50
FRANCES Uh hmm. 

00:06:50
JOHN COBB "and I know I'll get through it this time." 

00:06:50
FRANCES  Yeah. 

00:06:55
JOHN COBB And actually you're doing awfully well at the moment, Frances. You really are doing well because you've been here for more than a minute now. (crosstalk) 

00:07:00
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:07:00
JOHN COBB And I don't know but looking at you, it looks to me as though you're starting to settle down a bit. I mean, how are you feeling right now? 

00:07:05
FRANCES Well, I'm still feeling anxious but I'm not feeling as bad. 

00:07:10
JOHN COBB What, what level would that be on our scale? 

00:07:10
FRANCES It's probably down to about six or seven. (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
JOHN COBB Oh, you're looking a bit better now. And, and I wondered if you would feel we could go on with a bit of the therapy, the main part of the therapy that we talked about. 

00:07:25
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:07:25
JOHN COBB The exposure. Yeah. 

00:07:25
FRANCES Uh hmm. 

00:07:25
JOHN COBB How, do you remember the hierarchy we constructed? 

00:07:30
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:07:30
JOHN COBB Do you remember the different items... (crosstalk) 

00:07:30
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:07:30
JOHN COBB ...on the hierarchy? 

00:07:30
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:07:30
JOHN COBB  Right(ph). 

00:07:35
FRANCES It starts off with just looking at the hangers, the black plastic hangers... (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
JOHN COBB Right. 

00:07:35
FRANCES ...and moving on to eventually having the black bag in the bin in the kitchen and all the steps in between. (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
JOHN COBB Hmm. 

00:07:45
FRANCES Yeah. I know that. 

00:07:45
JOHN COBB How far up hierarchy would you be prepared to go today with me? 

00:07:50
FRANCES Well, not very far, I don't think... (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
JOHN COBB No. 

00:07:55
FRANCES ...though. Uhm. 

00:07:55
JOHN COBB Could, there, there it is there. Could, could, could you tell me... (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
FRANCES Well. 

00:08:00
JOHN COBB ...step one, or two, or three or? 

00:08:00
FRANCES Yeah. I know that you said last time that you were gonna bring the black plastic hanger this time... (crosstalk) 

00:08:05
JOHN COBB Yeah. 

00:08:05
FRANCES ...because I said I'd look at them at home. And I've looked at them but I haven't touched them. 

00:08:10
JOHN COBB All right. 

00:08:10
FRANCES And I guess, I wouldn't mind seeing you touching the black plastic hanger, but I don't be able to touch it. I don't mind looking at it... (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
JOHN COBB Okay. 

00:08:20
FRANCES ...sort of having one in here with us. 

00:08:25
JOHN COBB All right. So, you, you'd predicting at the moment that you'll be able to possibly get as far as that. 

00:08:30
FRANCES Oh, yeah. 

00:08:30
JOHN COBB It would be great if you could. 

00:08:30
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:08:30
JOHN COBB  That would be good. All right. Shall I get it now? I've got it here. 

00:08:35
FRANCES Okay. 

00:08:35
JOHN COBB Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
FRANCES You brought the black plastic bag as well in there, haven't you? (crosstalk) 

00:08:40
JOHN COBB That's right. I told you... (crosstalk) 

00:08:40
FRANCES Has... (crosstalk) 

00:08:40
JOHN COBB ...I'd bring that as well. 

00:08:40
FRANCES ...has he been touching that? 

00:08:40
JOHN COBB  What do you think? 

00:08:45
FRANCES Well, it looks like it probably has. 

00:08:45
JOHN COBB Yeah, yeah, So I'll be... (crosstalk) 

00:08:50
FRANCES So it makes me worse. 

00:08:50
JOHN COBB ...it makes it more difficult for you... (crosstalk) 

00:08:50
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:08:50
JOHN COBB ...doesn't it? Yup. So, it's gonna be a real test this. Can we just focus on this for the moment? Uhm, and what I'd like you to do is, it's just to look at the hanger, and to look at the black plastic. And what we need to see is is black plastic, but to think about the shape of it. Uh hmm? 

00:09:10
FRANCES Uh-huh. 

00:09:10
JOHN COBB See it, and watch me running my fingers around it. That's the shape of it. And the texture of it. Could you think about the texture of it? How, how, how do you think this would feel? 

00:09:20
FRANCES Well, it's gonna feel awful. (crosstalk) 

00:09:20
JOHN COBB  Well. (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
FRANCES It's gonna feel really like plastic. 

00:09:25
JOHN COBB Yes. Well, (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
FRANCES That's cold(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
JOHN COBB how would that be? 

00:09:25
FRANCES Well, it's cold and it will be kind, sort of, I don't know. Maybe, I don't really know. It's so long since I've... (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
JOHN COBB Yeah, when you touch it. (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
FRANCES ...touched anything that's plastic. (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
JOHN COBB Yeah, but would it be smooth or rough? 

00:09:35
FRANCES  I think it's probably quite smooth... (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
JOHN COBB Yes(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
FRANCES ...sharp edges, perhaps. 

00:09:40
JOHN COBB How sharp are the edges? 

00:09:40
FRANCES  Not, not sharp enough to cut... (crosstalk). 

00:09:45
JOHN COBB No. (crosstalk) 

00:09:45
FRANCES ...but sharp enough to. (crosstalk) 

00:09:45
JOHN COBB Well, I'm able to run my finger... (crosstalk) 

00:09:45
FRANCES Yeah, (crosstalk) 

00:09:45
JOHN COBB ...around that way. 

00:09:45
FRANCES  Yeah. 

00:09:50
JOHN COBB Yeah. I'm, I'm also not afraid of it in any way. 

00:09:50
FRANCES No, I can see that. 

00:09:55
JOHN COBB So, it's, it's, (crosstalk) 

00:09:55
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:09:55
JOHN COBB it doesn't bother me in, in the least to touch it, and... (crosstalk) 

00:09:55
FRANCES It doesn't bother me, you touching it. (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
JOHN COBB I could, I could rub it on my clothes... (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:10:00
JOHN COBB ...if that wouldn't bother you? 

00:10:00
FRANCES No. It wouldn't, it wouldn't bother me, you touching it. (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
JOHN COBB Hmm. 

00:10:05
FRANCES So, (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
JOHN COBB And I wouldn't be afraid if my finger... (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
FRANCES Uh hmm. 

00:10:05
JOHN COBB ...is touching my mouth having ah. (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
FRANCES  I wouldn't do it. 

00:10:10
JOHN COBB You wouldn't bet on that. 

00:10:10
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:10:10
JOHN COBB Yeah. Can I just, how close could, could I bring that to you? 

00:10:15
FRANCES I don't want you to come too close because it's touched the bag. (crosstalk) 

00:10:15
JOHN COBB  Well, I won't move it to you. (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
FRANCES No(ph). 

00:10:20
JOHN COBB I'd like you to move to me and to see how close you could get to that hanger. Okay? And you will stop whenever you, whenever you feel like it. So, you know, it's under your own control at the moment. 

00:10:30
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:10:30
JOHN COBB I'll just hold it there, and I'll hold it still. And I'm, you know I'm not gonna spring any surprises on you. (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
FRANCES You won't drop it on me, will you? 

00:10:35
JOHN COBB I won't drop it and I'm not gonna sort of suddenly shove at you there. I'm just gonna hold quite still. Okay? 

00:10:40
FRANCES Okay. 

00:10:40
JOHN COBB So could you lean forward and see how far you can get? Remember, it's, it's, the shape of it, and texture of it. And remember how important this is to, as a basis for overcoming the problem. 

00:10:55
FRANCES Yeah, I know that. It just feels much worse because I, and you've already touched the black plastic bag. 

00:11:00
JOHN COBB And remember the things that you want to do after you've overcome your problem; that one we have talked about...(crosstalk) 

00:11:05
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:11:05
JOHN COBB ...remember? 

00:11:05
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:11:05
JOHN COBB Having a dog in the house, remember talking about that? All the things you're gonna be able to do when you overcome this... (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
FRANCES Uh hmm. 

00:11:15
JOHN COBB ...problem of yours. So let's see how close you can get. 

00:11:15
FRANCES It makes me feel so stupid. It seems so crazy... (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
JOHN COBB Just... (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
FRANCES ...isn't it? 

00:11:20
JOHN COBB ...if I held out my hand, would you be able to touch my hand? 

00:11:20
FRANCES  Ah. 

00:11:25
JOHN COBB And you know my hand has been touching that thing. (crosstalk) 

00:11:25
FRANCES Okay. 

00:11:25
JOHN COBB Would you be able to do that? 

00:11:25
FRANCES I'm about. 

00:11:25
JOHN COBB Without losing it? 

00:11:25
FRANCES  Uhm, I think I'd probably rather touch the other hand because I think... (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
JOHN COBB This hand? (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
FRANCES ...which hand did you get it in the bag? 

00:11:35
JOHN COBB The right hand, the right hand, I think. I can't remember which it was. (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:11:40
JOHN COBB I can't remember. 

00:11:40
FRANCES You can't remember now... (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
JOHN COBB Okay. 

00:11:40
FRANCES  because it's on the either hand. (crosstalk) 

00:11:45
JOHN COBB But you would either touch the hand, either hand or you could touch, perhaps, touch the end of the hanger. If you could. 

00:11:50
FRANCES I could probably touch the end of the hanger, I think. (crosstalk) 

00:11:50
JOHN COBB Okay. 

00:11:50
FRANCES I'm not too happy about touching your hands. 

00:11:55
JOHN COBB All right. Let's see if you can touch the end of the hanger. That's, that's very good. Just hold on to it. That's excellent 'coz you've already done more than you expected today. That's really good, Frances, it's very good. 

00:12:05
JOHN COBB  We now move on to looking at the last few minutes of the session. 

00:12:10
JOHN COBB  Well, I, I can hardly (laugh) believe that you. (crosstalk). 

00:12:15
FRANCES  (laugh) I can't. 

00:12:20
JOHN COBB Hmm? 

00:12:20
FRANCES Yeah, (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
JOHN COBB Yeah, (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
FRANCES I never thought I'd do this today. 

00:12:20
JOHN COBB  Really. Now, I see you got much further than what you expected... (crosstalk) 

00:12:25
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:12:25
JOHN COBB ...which is, which is very encouraging. 

00:12:30
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:12:30
JOHN COBB Were gonna have to finish in a couple of minutes. I'd just like to review what we have managed to achieve in this session. 

00:12:35
FRANCES Uh hmm. 

00:12:35
JOHN COBB Maybe you could tell me what you think you've managed to achieve. 

00:12:40
FRANCES Well, I've touched and I'm holding this black plastic hanger. And, I don't have any at home, and I've never to, I've not touched one for so long, (crosstalk) 

00:12:50
JOHN COBB Hmm. 

00:12:50
FRANCES for ages. Years and years. And, and I really didn't think I was gonna be able to stay here today. I felt so bad when I came in. 

00:12:55
JOHN COBB That's right. There was a point when you thought you wanted to leave... (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:13:00
JOHN COBB ...and you managed to cope with that anxiety by yourself, (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:13:00
JOHN COBB didn't you? You managed to actually control that anxiety and bring it down by, by yourself. 

00:13:05
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:13:05
JOHN COBB Yeah, Good. How long do you think you'll manage to stay without washing after you leave here now? 

00:13:15
FRANCES Oh, I think, I actually feel that I want to wash my hands on the way out. 

00:13:20
JOHN COBB That's take to the bathroom. 

00:13:20
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:13:20
JOHN COBB Yeah. Is there any way you could delay that, do you think? 

00:13:25
FRANCES Uhm, I supposed, if, if there's someone I could talk to, (crosstalk) 

00:13:30
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. 

00:13:30
FRANCES or have a coffee with, or something like that. (crosstalk) 

00:13:30
JOHN COBB Yeah. 

00:13:30
FRANCES  It might help. 

00:13:35
JOHN COBB You seem to be going quite well with my secretary. Could you have a cup of coffee with her? 

00:13:35
FRANCES  If she don't, if she didn't mind. (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
JOHN COBB How could she mind? (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
FRANCES I think she minds. (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
JOHN COBB I don't think she'd mind at all. 

00:13:40
FRANCES She might think I was stupid. 

00:13:45
JOHN COBB No. No, I don't think she would. Well, you could ask her about that. 

00:13:45
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:13:45
JOHN COBB You know, you could talk about that, couldn't you? 

00:13:50
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:13:50
JOHN COBB And what about homework tasks? What, what do you think you could do at home between now and when I see you in a couple of days time? 

00:13:55
FRANCES Well, I suppose yeah, well, I've got to take this home, haven't I? 

00:14:00
JOHN COBB Well, that would be good if you could, yeah, yeah. 

00:14:05
FRANCES Well if I don't, I know, I'll probably be back to square one. I won't want to handle it again. 

00:14:10
JOHN COBB Right, so you'll take it at home... (crosstalk) 

00:14:10
FRANCES I'll take it home. 

00:14:10
JOHN COBB ...and, and handle it each day? 

00:14:10
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:14:10
JOHN COBB  How many times? 

00:14:15
FRANCES Three? More than... (crosstalk) 

00:14:15
JOHN COBB Four? 

00:14:15
FRANCES  Four, maybe. (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
JOHN COBB Okay, four? Would you... (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
FRANCES All right, I'll try. 

00:14:20
JOHN COBB ...take it out... (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
FRANCES I'll try. 

00:14:20
JOHN COBB ...four times a day. Handle it, yeah, (crosstalk) 

00:14:25
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:14:25
JOHN COBB as we have done here. 

00:14:25
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:14:25
JOHN COBB And then ah, perhaps you could measure how long you're able to stay at home uhm, without washing after you've handled it. 

00:14:35
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:14:35
JOHN COBB And perhaps, you could think of ways that could prolong that period... (crosstalk) 

00:14:35
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:14:35
JOHN COBB  as you thought of a way just after talking with the secretary, talking to your husband, listening to the radio or whatever. But you could think of some ways you could prolong it. And measure how long you are able to, to stay without washing your hands. (crosstalk) 

00:14:50
FRANCES Without washing my hands. 

00:14:50
JOHN COBB Okay? Could you do that? 

00:14:50
FRANCES I'll try that. 

00:14:50
JOHN COBB  Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
FRANCES I'll try that. I'll wash if, how is it, how can I wash? If anxiety gets to. 

00:15:00
JOHN COBB Supposing, what I mean, about, about do you think? Six or seven on our scale? 

00:15:00
FRANCES Yeah. If we got to about seven, I think I'll probably want to then. 

00:15:05
JOHN COBB Okay. 

00:15:05
FRANCES Is that all right? 

00:15:05
JOHN COBB Yeah. 

00:15:05
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:15:05
JOHN COBB But, if it gets to seven, you might say, "Well, I'll just hang on for one moment", and then go and wash. 

00:15:10
FRANCES Okay. 

00:15:10
JOHN COBB (laugh) All right. 

00:15:10
FRANCES That's right. (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
JOHN COBB  Okay. I'm a bit tough on you on that. 

00:15:15
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:15:15
JOHN COBB All right. Cheerio for now, Frances. I look forward to seeing you in two days. 

00:15:20
FRANCES All right. 

00:15:20
JOHN COBB You've seen part of a typical session and I hope having seeing that, you're now feeling close enough to want to perhaps, first of all role play with a colleague treatment of a the patient of your own, and then having got some confidence, you'll actually go out and start treatment for yourself. In order to help you with that, let's go back through this particular session and look at the main stages that are being used. Initially, after the mutual setting of an agenda,- 

00:15:50
Agenda setting Using of diary 

00:15:50
JOHN COBB - the therapist and patient look at the diary that's being kept by the patient during the week. Diaries are important and I'd like to individually design a diary with the patient so as to monitor those aspects of the problem which seem to be most important. Then we move on to anxiety management. And this was essential because without doing that, ah, this particular session would have come to as a halt. And it's also essential because this patient has got to learn to manage anxiety in, in order to be able to carry on with the therapy as it goes along. Relaxation, which is sometimes used in the management of anxiety, wasn't particularly helpful with this patient, so I moved on to a number of other techniques, starting with self-monitoring and encouraging the patient simply to stay with the feelings of anxiety and to observe them, and to see if they habituated. We then moved on to a number of cognitive techniques, in particular looking at positive self-statements and a rational explanation for the symptoms that the patient was experiencing. The third part of the session was the exposure part of the session. This is a central component of behavioural treatment. It's often a very difficult task for the patient to do because of anxiety levels. And in order to help, there was use of a hierarchy in this session, where the patient chose which position on the hierarchy she wanted to start. The therapist then modeled what was expected before moving on to the main exposure practice. The session ended with some feedback and summarizing and setting further homework tasks. Now, you'll have noticed as we were watching the tape, there, there were asterisks appearing on the screen. And each of those asterisks, in fact, referred to a different technique. There were 24 of these in all. What I'd like you to do now is to get hold of a piece of paper, put down numbers 1 to 24, play the tape again so that you can see how many of these particular techniques you can recognize and pick up. If you have difficulties, refer to the handout that comes along with this videotape. Now, you've seen this. When you finish that, I hope you'll go off. Do your homework task of seeing the patient, and then I hope you'll come back next week and see the second part.

Trouble-shooting in Behavioural Psychotherapy John Cobb and Shirley Mercer 

00:18:15
JOHN COBB  This is the second of our series of video assisted seminars in behavioural psychotherapy. I've called this second seminar "Trouble-shooting" because in real life, therapy is not as straightforward as it appears in the textbooks. In this particular session, we're going look at three typical problem situations which I've called "getting stuck, getting emotional and getting lost". Now, in order to assist you with the discussion, there are going to be discussion points which will be marked with a caption like this. 

00:21:30
Discussion point 

00:21:30
JOHN COBB When this caption comes on, I'd like you to turn off the videotape and discuss the predicament among yourselves. Now, since you last saw this patient, she's had four more sessions which have gone fairly well, and we're gonna pick up therapy in the sixth session. 

00:21:45
JOHN COBB  Okay. Hello, Frances. 

00:21:50
FRANCES Hi. 

00:21:50
JOHN COBB Session six, here we are. How are you feeling? 

00:21:55
FRANCES Awful. 

00:21:55
JOHN COBB Really? 

00:21:55
FRANCES Things just aren't working and it's been a lousy week. Everything's gone wrong and I just don't feel there is any point carrying on therapy, you know. 

00:22:05
JOHN COBB Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
FRANCES I just... (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
JOHN COBB Feeling stuck? 

00:22:05
FRANCES  yeah. It's just been awful. 

00:22:10
 Did you do the diary? 

00:22:10
FRANCES No. There wasn't any point. There just wasn't any point at all. 

00:22:15
 So you're feeling really stuck and there's no point and, (crosstalk) 

00:22:20
FRANCES I think it's, uhm, back to square one really. 

00:22:20
  The patient's stuck. There's a number of ways this could be handled. How would you set about it? 

00:22:25
Discussion point 

00:22:25
JOHN COBB  Frances, you've told me three things: that you're, you're fed up, that lots of bad things have happened to you during the week, and that you're not making progress, and you wanna quit therapy? 

00:22:50
FRANCES Uh-huh. That's how I feel. 

00:22:50
JOHN COBB All right. I wonder if we could just pick up one of those issues to start with and have a look at it a bit closer. 

00:23:00
FRANCES Uh hmm. 

00:23:00
JOHN COBB Which one would you like to? 

00:23:00
FRANCES  Well, I suppose not making any progress. (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
JOHN COBB Uh-huh. 

00:23:05
FRANCES We've had a lot of sessions now, and I just feel as uhm, the particularly over the last week, that I'm just not making progress. 

00:23:15
JOHN COBB All right. 

00:23:15
FRANCES In anyway. 

00:23:15
JOHN COBB  So you feel you're just the same as you were when you started? 

00:23:20
FRANCES Worse, really... (crosstalk) 

00:23:20
JOHN COBB Worse? 

00:23:20
FRANCES ...'coz I feel now that I failed, failed this treatment as well. 

00:23:25
JOHN COBB  All right. Could we look at some of the, remember we made some targets and we've been writing them. Can we just have a look at those to see, to see what the scores are. The, the first target was actually having plastic bags in, in your kitchen. 

00:23:40
FRANCES  Yeah. 

00:23:45
JOHN COBB Yeah. How much would you rate that now? 

00:23:45
FRANCES  Well, I guess I would rate it at eight because I, I got some bags in the kitchen now. They're not in the bins... (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
JOHN COBB Uh-huh. 

00:23:55
FRANCES ...they're sort of wrapped up under the sink, but they're not causing me quite so much anxiety. Maybe four or five there. 

00:24:05
JOHN COBB And that was eight before... (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:24:10
JOHN COBB ...so there has been a change there. 

00:24:10
FRANCES Uh-huh. 

00:24:10
JOHN COBB What about the second target of having a neighbor in for coffee? That was rather important. 

00:24:15
FRANCES Yeah. That was the one that I really wanted to do this week, (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
FRANCES and I just haven't been able to. 

00:24:20
JOHN COBB Uh-huh. So that's still an eight on our rating? 

00:24:25
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:24:25
JOHN COBB But have you made any steps towards that? You remember how we broke it up and we thought about different steps towards achieving that? 

00:24:35
FRANCES Yeah. I, uhm, I tried to ask her to come in. (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
JOHN COBB Hmm. 

00:24:40
FRANCES I actually started talking to her and, uhm, I told her about my problem. 

00:24:45
JOHN COBB  Did you? 

00:24:50
FRANCES Uh hmm. But, ah, when it came to actually ask her to come in for coffee I just, just couldn't do it. 

00:24:55
JOHN COBB So, you'd actually have made a couple of steps towards it? 

00:25:00
FRANCES Yeah. Yeah. 

00:25:00
JOHN COBB  You seem too grudging to admit that you might made progress. 

00:25:05
FRANCES I suppose because I wanted to do that one so much and I didn't. I feel sorry. 

00:25:10
JOHN COBB Well, you've got some steps towards it. 

00:25:15
FRANCES Uh hmm. 

00:25:15
JOHN COBB What I was thinking of, is if we looked at, at the ratings of how you're doing, we see an improvement.(crosstalk) 

00:25:20
FRANCES Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
JOHN COBB And yet if we asked you how you're feeling about how you're doing, you don't see any change. How do you explain that discrepancy? 

00:25:30
FRANCES Well, yeah puts it right that. The evidence is, uhm, doing better than what I'm saying... (crosstalk) 

00:25:40
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. 

00:25:40
FRANCES ...I guess it's me just putting myself down again and thinking negatively and being a bit miserable about the whole thing. 

00:25:45
JOHN COBB Right. So it's like a voice telling you that you're doing the wrong thing, that "Frances, you're not doing this properly," that "Frances, you haven't done this... (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
FRANCES Uh-huh. 

00:25:55
JOHN COBB ..."very well". 

00:25:55
FRANCES Uh-huh. 

00:25:55
JOHN COBB And at that moment you're getting a way to that voice, aren't you? 

00:25:55
FRANCES Yeah, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
JOHN COBB You're letting it get you down right now. 

00:26:00
FRANCES Yeah, yeah. 

00:26:00
JOHN COBB Yeah? 

00:26:00
FRANCES Yeah. It is getting me down. 

00:26:05
JOHN COBB And what do you wanna do about it? 

00:26:05
FRANCES When I came in, I wanted to leave you know, get out of therapy but... (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
JOHN COBB Hmm. 

00:26:10
FRANCES ...I suppose being in here for a while now and going through the evidence, I suppose really what I want to do is carry on. I want to, I want to get better and, uhm, I know that we've, in some ways we've come quite a long way in therapy and I suppose what I want to do is continue. 

00:26:25
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. Because you wanna fight back against the way we, you put yourself down. 

00:26:30
FRANCES Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
JOHN COBB Aren't you? 

00:26:30
FRANCES Yeah. I do. 

00:26:30
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:26:30
JOHN COBB  Because it isn't helping you, isn't it? 

00:26:35
FRANCES No. 

00:26:35
JOHN COBB Okay. How far up the high rank you do think you might go this session? 

00:26:40
FRANCES Well, I feel though, huh, we starting to be very far, but then we're practically at the, some of the top of high ranking... (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
JOHN COBB That's right. 

00:26:45
FRANCES  anyway I'm be. (crosstalk) 

00:26:50
JOHN COBB I wonder what's now the reason why you might be feeling a bit down today... (crosstalk) 

00:26:50
FRANCES Hmm. 

00:26:50
JOHN COBB ...actually is that we're up to tackling the plastic bag, aren't we? 

00:26:55
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:26:55
JOHN COBB And that you'd been dreading all along. Hmm? 

00:27:00
FRANCES Uh-huh. 

00:27:00
JOHN COBB How do you feel about us? 

00:27:05
FRANCES Well, (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
JOHN COBB I have been that right now? 

00:27:05
FRANCES ...I suppose I feel that we ought to do it because if we don't, then it's gonna be worse next time, isn't it? 

00:27:15
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. 

00:27:15
FRANCES If I don't do it today uhm, ah, and I suppose in many ways, I have to psyching myself to look forward... (crosstalk) 

00:27:20
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. 

00:27:20
FRANCES ...for today. So I guess we should go ahead. 

00:27:25
JOHN COBB So, would you tell me to go ahead? 

00:27:25
FRANCES  Okay. Go ahead. 

00:27:30
JOHN COBB All right. Oh, I'm sorry. 

00:27:40
[sil.] 

00:27:40
FRANCES  I'm sorry. God, that touched me. 

00:28:00
[sil.] 

00:28:00
FRANCES  That bag touched me, there. 

00:28:15
JOHN COBB I don't know. I'm, I'm sorry I was clumsy. 

00:28:15
JOHN COBB  I've clearly put my foot in it here. I guess we all mistakes, don't we? What I'd like you to discuss is first of all, what is actually is happening at the moment. And secondly, is where would you go from here. 

00:28:30
Discussion point 

00:28:30
JOHN COBB  I didn't do it deliberately. 

00:28:45
FRANCES I felt that's the way you did. 

00:28:50
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. 

00:28:50
FRANCES  I don't (inaudible ) there. 

00:28:56
JOHN COBB  You must feel that's the last straw. 

00:29:05
FRANCES Sorry, it feels like the weeks been awful and now, sorry. 

00:29:10
JOHN COBB And now, it didn't help you either. And now, I've got a made a mess at things? 

00:29:15
FRANCES Yeah. No, I just feel so I'm never going to get over this damn fear. 

00:29:25
JOHN COBB Hmm. You must be really very fed up with me, I should think. Were you such a clumsy as. 

00:29:30
FRANCES  Actually, how far, you've been... (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
JOHN COBB Hmm. 

00:29:35
FRANCES ...trying to help all long, haven't you? 

00:29:35
JOHN COBB  Hmm. 

00:29:40
FRANCES And I suppose in many ways you have been helping that's how I wouldn't have come back today, would I? 

00:29:45
JOHN COBB But I knew that was a crucial moment in the therapy. I'm guess I was feeling nervous too, you know. I guess it was getting to me. 

00:29:50
FRANCES  That's the way. (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
JOHN COBB I'm not normally clumsy like that. 

00:29:55
FRANCES  It's that damn bag, isn't it? 

00:30:00
JOHN COBB Uh-huh. 

00:30:00
FRANCES It's that bag, isn't it? 

00:30:00
JOHN COBB It is that damn bag isn't it? 

00:30:05
FRANCES Well, what would you do...(crosstalk) 

00:30:05
JOHN COBB It looks like giving me the kick. 

00:30:05
FRANCES Yeah. I did. 

00:30:05
JOHN COBB Hmm. I just feel like I didn't kick it back because I might kick it unto you. 

00:30:10
FRANCES Yeah. I feel like kicking it. 

00:30:15
JOHN COBB Hmm. 

00:30:15
FRANCES I just don't know whether I'm gonna be able to. 

00:30:15
JOHN COBB Hmm. 

00:30:15
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:30:15
JOHN COBB  That damn bag really have messed up your life. You've lost 10 years of your life, effectively Frances, because of that damn bag, didn't you? 

00:30:25
FRANCES  Yeah. I have. 

00:30:30
JOHN COBB Hmm. 

00:30:30
FRANCES  I hate that... (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
JOHN COBB You hate that bag? 

00:30:35
FRANCES ...bag, you know, I really do hate it. 

00:30:40
JOHN COBB Yeah. Think what its done to you, it really suffocated you for the last 10 years. 

00:30:45
FRANCES  It's wrecked everything... (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
JOHN COBB So, is that... (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
FRANCES ...my life, its wrecking my marriage. 

00:30:50
JOHN COBB It's wrecked your happiness? 

00:30:55
FRANCES It wrecked everything. 

00:30:55
JOHN COBB It's complete wrecked you that damn bag. 

00:30:55
FRANCES  I do either. 

00:31:00
JOHN COBB That bloody bag. It really has wrecked your life, isn't it? 

00:31:05
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:31:05
JOHN COBB Hmm. 

00:31:05
FRANCES  I feel like, I really want to tear it up, you know. 

00:31:10
JOHN COBB Yeah? Well, (inaudible ) now. You can actually, (crosstalk) 

00:31:16
FRANCES Ah, no, don't. 

00:31:16
JOHN COBB  I'm gonna start tearing it up like that. 

00:31:20
FRANCES I have no... (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
JOHN COBB  You think you could that? Tear it up like that? 

00:31:30
FRANCES (inaudible ), it's gonna make me feel any worse now, isn't it? (crosstalk) 

00:31:31
JOHN COBB Uhm, I don't think if (inaudible ) Frances, I think you really couldn't feel any worse, could you? When you are now? 

00:31:40
FRANCES I don't know what to say. (crosstalk) 

00:31:40
JOHN COBB Don't act you're quite satisfying to tear it up. I'd do it because (inaudible ) a little bit fed with this bloody bag. I gone over about the bag, haven't we? 

00:31:45
FRANCES  Let me tear it. 

00:31:50
JOHN COBB Tear it, tear it up. Tear it up. Come on, do a bit more. Let's really, let's really tear it this way, come on. Let's do it together, shall we. Let's do it together. Really tear that damn thing up. Just tear it, come on, tear it up. It's really good at it, isn't it? Good, good. It's terrific. 

00:32:15
FRANCES  Sorry. 

00:32:20
JOHN COBB  We worked with the bag for at least another 20 minutes after this. But at that point, uhm, she'd settle down, and I thought it was important to give it a chance to tell me about some of the things that been on her mind when she came into the session that day. 

00:32:40
JOHN COBB Okay, well, you've done very well. You made it. 

00:32:40
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:32:40
JOHN COBB  It's quite a session. 

00:32:45
FRANCES Yeah. It was. 

00:32:45
JOHN COBB Hmm. We still got 20 minutes to go. And, uhm, you know, I feel you've made a tremendous amount of progress. There was some things that you wanted to talk about, if you remember some things on your mind. 

00:32:55
FRANCES Oh yeah. I mean, just the whole week has been awful. It really has been. In fact, we, the weekend was just, I think the worse ever. Austin and I were supposed to be going out to look at a dog. You know how we'd agree that if, if when I get well, I was gonna have a dog. 

00:33:10
JOHN COBB Yeah. 

00:33:10
FRANCES We'd agree that we'd go off and look at them on Saturday afternoon. 

00:33:15
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. 

00:33:15
FRANCES And I was getting all ready to go and I was really sort of excited and pleased about going looking for this dog. The phone rang. It was my aunt, but she wanted us to (inaudible ) with some step ladders or something like this. She wanted Austin to pick the step ladder that was something. Oh, it would only take five minutes to drive from our house to aunt's, it takes five minutes what happens. Austin starts cursing and swearing and having a real big row with me about it. We eventually got around, so that delays us. We get around to my aunts. She said moaning about with ladders and wanting him to put something up on the roof, some tile or something, and it ends up that we not able to go out for the dog. I'm sorry, it's really fed up by that. So, I went shopping. (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
JOHN COBB Hmm(ph). 

00:33:50
FRANCES  I got home and I was a bit angry. Now, but rather than get uptight and anxious and all the rest of it, I'll go shopping. When shopping and then I went to lost my bloody purse. And I'm quite sure that some hobo behind me actually picked it. I'm quite sure I know, where it was. 

00:34:05
JOHN COBB She talked on in this way for another 10 minutes. Ah, by this stage, I was getting a bit more fed up by the whole thing, and she seemed to be getting more, more wound up. 

00:34:15
Discussion point 

00:34:15
JOHN COBB I wonder how you would have tackled this rather familiar situation. 

00:34:20
FRANCES I give the description of the lad that I thought who picked up the purse. And you know, they weren't even interested. They, they sort of said, "Well there's a hundred and odd lads this age. You know they said my description wasn't very good", they sort of said that. I obviously weren't, I wasn't a observant and I didn't know what school uniform he had on. I coudn't even remember whether he had the city's school uniform or the... (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
JOHN COBB  Frances, I wanna interrupt for a moment... (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
FRANCES ...training school uniform. (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
JOHN COBB Can I interrupt you just now. (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
FRANCES Okay. Can I just finish? 

00:34:45
JOHN COBB Because well, I want to know is you've been talking for about 10 minutes almost non-stop... (crosstalk) 

00:34:50
FRANCES Oh. I'm sorry. (crosstalk) 

00:34:50
JOHN COBB ...and what I wanna know is whether this, I'm not being critical of you, but I wanna know whether this is helping you. Getting it off your chest like this, does it help? (crosstalk) 

00:35:00
FRANCES No. 

00:35:00
JOHN COBB Does it make you feel better? 

00:35:00
FRANCES It doesn't just makes me feel worse. I'm just getting more, and more wound up here. 

00:35:05
JOHN COBB I mean that's what I've been seeing... (crosstalk) 

00:35:05
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:35:05
JOHN COBB ...as you been talking, you've been getting more, more wound up. And I think that's the way your mind works that you see problems on every side, and the more you focus on them, the more you talk about them, the bigger they get. 

00:35:15
FRANCES Yeah. 

00:35:15
JOHN COBB And the more, you'd feel fed up and anxious about the whole thing. 

00:35:20
FRANCES And I go around in circles. 

00:35:20
JOHN COBB And you do go round in circles. 

00:35:20
FRANCES  Yeah. 

00:35:25
JOHN COBB So, could we just take the things you'd been talking to me about and think about ways in which we could stop this sort of escalation. 

00:35:30
FRANCES And how could we do that? 

00:35:35
JOHN COBB Well, one of the ways we can do it, is actually to pick one of the things you've talked about. You've talked about a number of different things. 

00:35:40
FRANCES Hmm. 

00:35:40
JOHN COBB And ask you to focus on that. And to see... (crosstalk) 

00:35:45
FRANCES Okay. 

00:35:45
JOHN COBB ...what we could do about it. 

00:35:45
FRANCES Well, its not worth going on about the purse, not really worth going on about my aunt anymore, that's done with. But I guess, it is worth talking about Austin. (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
JOHN COBB Uh hmm. 

00:35:55
FRANCES Because things are uhm, up are still bad there... (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
JOHN COBB All right. 

00:36:00
FRANCES ...and difficult. Yeah. 

00:36:00
JOHN COBB Yeah. 

00:36:00
FRANCES  Yeah. He's not really being as supportive and helpful now as he was in the beginning, you know. He seems to, he isn't actually sabotaging, but you know, he, at the beginning he, he was supportive and he seems to have faded it off really. 

00:36:15
JOHN COBB  Hmm. Do you think the time has come to ask him to come along to the next session? 

00:36:20
FRANCES  Yeah. I guess he is, you know, I think. 

00:36:25
JOHN COBB  You probably realized in your discussion that really there are no recipes for dealing with problems that we've seen in this particular session. I was just demonstrating some of the possibilities. If we take the first one, getting stuck, I think the important thing here is not to give up and not to allow yourself to be overwhelmed by the patient's negative feelings. Also, try to avoid labeling these patients as noncompliant and poorly motivated because they haven't brought their diary along. Try and do an analysis to understand why it is they haven't brought the task that you set them. What you saw me doing in this particular case was first of all, focusing on a particular issue, and then really using cognitive techniques, which you will see demonstrated in a, in a, in a later seminar to help her get back into therapy. As far the second problem was concerned, the emotional outburst, the way that I'd proceeded here was to actually use the emotion rather than to try and understand it and discover what it was all about. Now, I'm sure that particular point would've promoted quite a bit of discussion and some of you may think that a, a more appropriate way would've been to find out what is emotion was about and to find out whether there was anger mixed up with the unhappiness and so on. It is very common in behavioural treatments that when difficult exposure is being done, catharsis takes place. It is important to stay with it, to be supportive and to encourage the patient to continue with the task and not back off and to stay with the exposure until the emotion starts to settle down. The final ah, point that was demonstrated was perhaps, the most uhm, elementary of all. Uhm, what I think the important thing here is don't be afraid to interrupt, don't be afraid to look at what is happening in the session and what the discussion in the session is doing to the patient, and don't be afraid again to refocus and look at particular issues. Its often a good idea to, to bring in the relative, ah, at this sort of stage in therapy. So, all in all, there are no clear recipes for dealing with these sort of problems, ah, in behavioural psychotherapy. It's useful to have done some reading, it's even more useful to have come to seminars like this and had a chance to discuss problems ah, with your colleagues. But in the final analysis, there is no substitute for getting out and treating patients. If you have an experienced supervisor to talk through problems with, then of course, that's ideal, but many of you won't have this and in that case, what I'd like you to do is to get together with other enthusiastic colleagues and discuss your problems as they arise.

00:40:05
DAVID GOLDBERG Last time, we gave you an opportunity to become familiar with the kind of forms that are used in cognitive psychotherapy. I expect some of you had a go of doing a bit of cognitive restructuring during the role play that followed that tape. Today, we want to show you cognitive restructuring in rather greater detail. The patient you're about to see was known to Dr. Bishay because he had treated a previous depressive illness. She came back to him having what seemed to be a recurrence. Then the course of the interview you'll see, she describes some psychotic forms of experience. Although he naturally treated her with drugs for a depression of this severity, nonetheless, you'll see how he uses cognitive techniques even with psychotic forms of experience. 

00:40:55
DR. NAGY BISHAY  Good evening, Clara. 

00:41:00
CLARA Good evening, Dr. Bishay. 

00:41:05
DR. NAGY BISHAY I haven't seen you for a few months now. 

00:41:05
 Hmm. 

00:41:05
DR. NAGY BISHAY  What has happened this time? 

00:41:10
 I'm not feeling quite right again. I keep, keep bursting into tears and I can't eat my food and not looking after the home properly and the little one. I don't feel, uhm, I'm not being a, a proper wife and mother anymore. I just don't seem to be able to cope with it anymore. 

00:41:30
DR. NAGY BISHAY  Yes. Has anything happened that brought it on? 

00:41:40
Looking for a precipitating event 

00:41:40
CLARA  Not, not really. It's just been this last, this last two weeks and, and I can see that other people think I'm not a good wife and mother- 

00:41:55
A negative thought Establish her evidence 

00:41:55
CLARA - either 'coz, 'coz I know. (crosstalk) 

00:41:55
DR. NAGY BISHAY How? 

00:41:55
CLARA 'Coz I can tell. Well, it's, it's, well, John's parents, you see. I mean, they keep coming around and ah, saying, "Oh, well. We'll look after Jack and don't you worry and we'll take him off your hands." You know, and I can see that. I think I'm, I'm, I'm no good. 

00:42:15
Establishes negative thoughts 

00:42:15
DR. NAGY BISHAY So when your in-laws see that you are unwell and unable to look after your son, as, as you've just said and offered to help you, you say that they are saying you are no good? 

00:42:35
CLARA Well, yes. 

00:42:35
DR. NAGY BISHAY  How is, how, how can this fit? 

00:42:45
[sil.] 

00:42:45
CLARA  Well, they didn't use to help so much before. Mind, (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
DR. NAGY BISHAY Oh, I see. 

00:42:55
CLARA mind you I didn't go out very much. 

00:43:00
DR. NAGY BISHAY But you were well then... (crosstalk) 

00:43:00
CLARA Because, (crosstalk) 

00:43:00
DR. NAGY BISHAY ...weren't you? 

00:43:00
CLARA yeah. I've, I've been, I've been all right. Up until recently I've been all right... (crosstalk) 

00:43:05
DR. NAGY BISHAY So, if you're well, (crosstalk) 

00:43:05
CLARA ...for a while. 

00:43:05
DR. NAGY BISHAY ...and able to do your job, why do you want them to help? 

00:43:10
 Well, uhm, I suppose you're right. Really, I didn't ask them then. Yeah. 

00:43:20
DR. NAGY BISHAY So, don't you think you could have done this on your own. That is right here. Do you remember these forms we went through... (crosstalk) 

00:43:30
CLARA Yeah. 

00:43:30
DR. NAGY BISHAY ...from last year. (crosstalk) 

00:43:30
CLARA I do, yes. Yeah. 

00:43:30
DR. NAGY BISHAY Ah, John's parents... (crosstalk) 

00:43:35
CLARA It's the same wasn't it? 

00:43:35
DR. NAGY BISHAY Yes. John's parents, can you write until to the upsetting thoughts? 

00:43:40
CLARA What? 

00:43:40
DR. NAGY BISHAY  What you have just said that John's parents. 

00:43:45
 John's parents are coming around more often and... (crostalk) 

00:43:50
DR. NAGY BISHAY And say that you are not a good wife or something. 

00:43:55
[sil.] 

00:43:55
CLARA  They haven't actually said that. But... (crosstalk) 

00:44:05
DR. NAGY BISHAY So, what then? 

00:44:05
CLARA ...but they were just coming around and... (crosstalk) 

00:44:05
DR. NAGY BISHAY Yes, but your thoughts were, what are the thoughts that... (crosstalk) 

00:44:10
CLARA Uhm. 

00:44:10
DR. NAGY BISHAY ...that jumped into your mind. What did they think? 

00:44:15
CLARA Hmm, John's parents think I'm not a good wife and mother. 

00:44:30
[sil.] 

00:44:30
DR. NAGY BISHAY  Yes. What were, was, would be the conclusion then? Then the rational alternative? 

00:44:45
CLARA  Well, that they're coming around because they can see I'm not as well as I was... (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
DR.NAGY BISHAY Okay. 

00:44:55
CLARA ...before. 

00:44:55
DR. NAGY BISHAY Can you write there they are only coming to help because I'm unwell at the moment. They don't mean... (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
CLARA  Hmm. 

00:45:05
DR. NAGY BISHAY ...that, hmm. 

00:45:10
[sil.] 

00:45:10
  They're only coming to help because I'm not well. 

00:45:15
DR. NAGY BISHAY Yes. What other thoughts- 

00:45:25
Are there other negative thoughts? 

00:45:25
DR. NAGY BISHAY - are playing (inaudible ) in your mind that are sort of upsetting you now? 

00:45:30
[sil.] 

00:45:30
CLARA  Do you know what I said to you last year about, about that man that I went with? 

00:45:40
DR. NAGY BISHAY Yes. 

00:45:40
CLARA Two, two weeks after we got married. 

00:45:45
DR. NAGY BISHAY Yes. 

00:45:45
 Hmm. Well, I think I've got VD- 

00:45:50
Negative thought (delusional) 

00:45:50
 - and I think I've given it to, to Jack and to John now. And, ah, other people seem to know about it 'coz I've heard them, I've heard them saying things about me. 

00:46:05
DR. NAGY BISHAY What sort of things? 

00:46:10
[sil.] 

00:46:10
CLARA  That I'm smelly and dirty. 

00:46:15
DR. NAGY BISHAY  Can you- 

00:46:20
Is she hallucinated? 

00:46:20
DR. NAGY BISHAY say exactly what are the words you've heard? 

00:46:25
CLARA  "She is smelly." 

00:46:30
DR. NAGY BISHAY When did this happen? 

00:46:35
CLARA It was, well it was more than, except when I'm in the supermarkets and, and in berry market. 

00:46:40
DR. NAGY BISHAY  Uh-huh. And this happened on? 

00:46:45
CLARA  Well, it's a day before yesterday when I was in berry market and couple of times last week when I was out shopping. 

00:46:55
DR. NAGY BISHAY I see. So it didn't happen in the house. It didn't happen? 

00:47:00
CLARA No. 

00:47:00
DR. NAGY BISHAY It's only on few occasions. Yes. 

00:47:05
Ask for meaning of symptom 

00:47:05
DR. NAGY BISHAY And what does it mean when they say that she is smelly? 

00:47:10
CLARA  Well, I think- 

00:47:15
Upsetting thought identified 

00:47:15
CLARA - I think they know that I'm, I'm, I'm a bad woman, that I'm not a good wife. That I... (crosstalk) 

00:47:20
DR. NAGY BISHAY  That is not. (crosstalk) 

00:47:25
 ...have done a terrible thing I shouldn't... (crosstalk) 

00:47:25
DR. NAGY BISHAY There is... (crosstalk) 

00:47:30
CLARA ...have done. 

00:47:30
NAGY BISHAY ...a possibility that they could be just talking about anybody else. 

00:47:30
CLARA Oh, no. No. 

00:47:30
DR. NAGY BISHAY  Do you know these people? 

00:47:35
CLARA No. No. But... (crosstalk) 

00:47:35
DR. NAGY BISHAY So? 

00:47:35
CLARA ...I heard them. (crosstalk) 

00:47:35
DR. NAGY BISHAY  Yes. 

00:47:40
CLARA This. (crosstalk) 

00:47:40
Restructuring begins 

00:47:40
DR. NAGY BISHAY But if you don't know them, how do they know you? 

00:47:40
CLARA  Well, it, I don't, I don't think they do know me. 

00:47:50
DR. NAGY BISHAY So, if they don't know you, how would they know about what you've done? 

00:47:55
 I don't, I don't know. I don't suppose, I don't suppose they do. But I heard them. I heard them say, "She is smelly." 

00:48:10
Offers alternative explanation 

00:48:10
DR. NAGY BISHAY Sometimes we mishear things. That is quite normal. We think that we have our names called and we look back and we don't find anybody that we know. 

00:48:20
CLARA You mean I, I imagined it. 

00:48:25
DR. NAGY BISHAY I didn't say you imagined it, did I? 

00:48:25
CLARA I'm not mad, am I? I mean. (crosstalk) 

00:48:30
DR. NAGY BISHAY No. I didn't say so. But didn't it happen to you before this illness at all? Two years ago, three years ago that you were walking along the streets and thought that somebody said, "Clara" and looked back... (crosstalk) 

00:48:45
CLARA Uh hmm. 

00:48:45
DR. NAGY BISHAY ...but you didn't see anybody? 

00:48:45
CLARA  Yeah, I remember that, yeah. 

00:48:50
DR. NAGY BISHAY So this is... (crosstalk) 

00:48:50
 Yes. 

00:48:50
DR. NAGY BISHAY ...quite a normal experience. It is when we are emotionally upset and depressed. It could just have heard this tone and add to it while it doesn't necessarily mean- 

00:49:05
Amplifies alternative explanation 

00:49:05
DR. NAGY BISHAY - that they knew and that they know about what you've done. Moreover, why are you feeling so bad about what you've done? 

00:49:15
CLARA Well, it's wrong, isn't it? It's wrong. 

00:49:20
DR. NAGY BISHAY Yes. 

00:49:20
CLARA And I've, I've harmed them. 

00:49:20
DR. NAGY BISHAY  Who? 

00:49:25
CLARA Well, Jack, the little one and my husband. I've harmed them, haven't I? 

00:49:30
DR. NAGY BISHAY  How? 

00:49:35
Negative thought (delusional) 

00:49:35
CLARA When I, when I've got, I've, I've given them VD. 

00:49:40
DR. NAGY BISHAY Did you have VD yourself? To give them... (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
CLARA Well, (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
DR. NAGY BISHAY ...to others? 

00:49:45
 I think, I might have, yes. 

00:49:45
DR. NAGY BISHAY How? 

00:49:45
CLARA Well, I think I have don't, don't, I think, don't, don't you always get it, don't you? 

00:49:55
DR. NAGY BISHAY No. Always, you mean to say that- 

00:50:00
Establishes patient's belief 

00:50:00
DR. NAGY BISHAY - every couple when they have sexual intercourse, then they have VD. 

00:50:05
 Yes. Out, out, outside, if... (crosstalk) 

00:50:05
DR. NAGY BISHAY  Outside marriage. (crosstalk) 

00:50:10
CLARA ...and if you're not married, you know. 

00:50:10
Question her evidence 

00:50:10
DR. NAGY BISHAY All right. If that, that partner is healthy, why should you have VD? 

00:50:15
CLARA  Uhm, when I. (crosstalk) 

00:50:20
DR. NAGY BISHAY You said you had this... (crosstalk) 

00:50:25
CLARA I don't know. 

00:50:25
DR. NAGY BISHAY ...relation. 

00:50:25
CLARA Yeah. 

00:50:25
DR. NAGY BISHAY Two, two weeks after marriage and after this you became pregnant, correct? 

00:50:30
CLARA A bit later, afterwards. (crosstalk) 

00:50:30
DR. NAGY BISHAY Yes. 

00:50:30
CLARA Yeah. 

00:50:30
DR. NAGY BISHAY  During pregnancy, they have done a whole group of blood tests. 

00:50:40
CLARA Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:50:45
DR. NAGY BISHAY Did they say you are unwell in anyway? Did they say anything? 

00:50:45
CLARA No. No. They said that I was quite healthy. 

00:50:50
DR. NAGY BISHAY And then you were admitted to hospital. You had... (crosstalk) 

00:50:50
CLARA Yes. 

00:50:50
DR. NAGY BISHAY ...the operation done last year. 

00:50:55
CLARA Hmm. 

00:50:55
DR. NAGY BISHAY And then did they find out anything unusual? 

00:51:00
CLARA No. No. 

00:51:00
DR. NAGY BISHAY So, what do you think? 

00:51:00
CLARA  Well, I suppose I haven't 'coz they've said that little Jack is, is quite healthy. They've said he's getting okay. 

00:51:10
DR. NAGY BISHAY So then he can't have VD then? 

00:51:15
CLARA No. No. I suppose he can't. No. 

00:51:15
DR. NAGY BISHAY  So, you have no evidence here that you had VD nor that you've passed it if you don't have it you can't pass it to anybody else, anyway? 

00:51:30
CLARA No. 

00:51:30
DR. NAGY BISHAY  And... (crosstalk) 

00:51:35
CLARA Oh. 

00:51:35
DR. NAGY BISHAY ...the child is growing normally. You... (crosstalk) 

00:51:35
CLARA Yes. 

00:51:35
DR. NAGY BISHAY ...said it. When you used to go to the post-natal clinics, what did they say about his growth? 

00:51:40
CLARA They said he was fine, fine. He's... (crosstalk) 

00:51:45
DR. NAGY BISHAY Did they say... (crosstalk) 

00:51:45
CLARA ...okay. 

00:51:45
DR. NAGY BISHAY ...that he is under developed in any way? 

00:51:50
CLARA No. No. 

00:51:50
DR. NAGY BISHAY They said he was average? 

00:51:50
CLARA Yeah. Yeah. 

00:51:55

CLARA  Well, I suppose I must. 

00:52:00
Ask for the meaning of the event 

00:52:00
DR. NAGY BISHAY  How do you feel about what you've done? 

00:52:05
Upsetting thought undentified 

00:52:05
CLARA  I feel terribly guilty about it. I feel awful about it. 

00:52:15
DR. NAGY BISHAY  I think, how old are you now? Is my memory correct, 24? 25? 

00:52:20
CLARA Nearly 25. 

00:52:20
DR. NAGY BISHAY 25. And this other man was, how old? 

00:52:30
CLARA  I don't know, I think he was in his 40's, early 40's or something. 

00:52:35
DR. NAGY BISHAY  So, if we will accept that this is something bad, who is to get- 

00:52:50
Questions 'all-or-none' thinking 

00:52:50
DR. NAGY BISHAY - most of the blame? Is it the 40 years old or is it the 23 years old? It was two years ago now. 

00:53:05
CLARA  Well, if you put it that way, I suppose he should have, I mean, I suppose he should have known better really. I mean, he's a bit... (crosstalk) 

00:53:15
DR. NAGY BISHAY  Is there... (crosstalk) 

00:53:20
CLARA ...older. 

00:53:20
DR. NAGY BISHAY ...a rule or not of such we shouldn't make any mistakes?

CLARA  Hmm. I don't know. I spoke to my sister about it, you know. 

00:54:10
DR. NAGY BISHAY Uh hmm. 

00:54:10
CLARA  And then I was shocked because she said, I never knew before, but she said that, it's going back a bit now. She had an affair, living with a man, went home for a few months or something. And then she decided that she wanted to stay with her husband and, and the kids and that. And she gave this other man up and the, the husband forgave her. You know, I was, I was that shocked to hear that 'coz I have no idea. So I suppose she, she made a mistake as well. 

00:54:55
DR. NAGY BISHAY  So? 

00:55:00
CLARA Well. (crosstalk) 

00:55:00

DR. NAGY BISHAY So, there is no way anybody else will know about you unless either yourself or this man speak?

CLARA  I don't, I don't think he'd, he'd say anything. I don't, I don't think he would. 

00:55:20
DR. NAGY BISHAY You don't think he would say anything? 

00:55:25
CLARA No. I don't think so. 

00:55:25
DR. NAGY BISHAY And you haven't told it to anybody?

DAVID GOLDBERG  Now you've got a clearer idea of cognitive restructuring. We'd like you to try it out among yourselves. Once more, we'd like you to divide yourself into pairs and decide which one is to be the therapist. In a moment, a caption will come up on the video tape inviting you to stop the machine. When it appears, for those of you who have decided to be therapists, please leave the room and allow those who are going to be patients to view the remainder of this videotape.

01:09:05
DAVID GOLDBERG  I hope I'm just talking to the patients now. You've just failed a big exam. You decide which one, but make it a big important one. And in the week or so that followed that failure, you become depressed, you are sleeping badly, waking early in the morning, and, ah, you are rather crying or feeling close to tears depending on what you can identify best with. The important thing, needless to say, are the depressive ideas that go with that depressed mood. Now, you feel that you are a failure. And basically, the reason you are a failure is that you are terribly lazy. And what is more, this failure in the exam means that you are henceforth not going to be able to get jobs and thus, you won't be able to support your family. In a word, you are facing ruin. I hope you enjoy the role play.

01:10:05
PROF. MALCOLM BROWN  This videotape on counseling and the physically handicapped is intended for social workers, doctors, nurses, voluntary workers, and others who are involved with people who are physically handicapped and who want to understand more of the psychology of handicapped and develop their skills in the counseling and helping roles. Four people discussed their handicap and its implications for them. In many ways, their situations are quite different, yet the shared reality of a physical handicap creates similarities both in human responses and in the forms of help that should be made available. The first thing to view is with a lady who was born with spina bifida. This condition has particularly affected her physical growth and her mobility. We pick up on the interview where she is discussing going to a special residential school at the age of 11 years. 

01:12:10
IRENE PALMER 

01:12:10
IRENE PALMER When I went to the special school, I felt pretty isolated, uhm, and it wasn't so easy to talk to them about certain things like that. And ah, I think a lot of, people, I think, assumed that if you are born with a disability, that you have no complex of either to talk, that it comes natural to you. And it doesn't really, I think when I was about 13 or 14 and I saw the other girls, and they were going to ice skating and things like that, and they were going out and having a good time. And I, I felt very left out. And, uhm, as I say, in the special school, we weren't really encouraged to do very much at all. We didn't get mixed with other children very well. It was only when I came home at the weekends. I, I got home on a Saturday and returned on a Sunday. And I got mixing with my friends and, but I'm, I started to find it very difficult when I left at 16... (crosstalk) 

01:13:15
PROF. MALCOLM BROWN Yes., 

01:13:15
IRENE PALMER ...cause I, I did feel apart from them in a certain way. 

01:13:20
PROF. MALCOLM BROWN Yes. Yes., 

01:13:20
IRENE PALMER Maybe I was angry with myself for being disabled. I don't know. I, I can't say I was angry with my family or angry with anyone else. It was no one's fault that was disabled, but, uhm, I, I did feel very frustrated, yes. 

01:13:35
PROF. MALCOLM BROWN Yet(ph). How would you say your adult life has been? 

01:13:35
IRENE PALMER  It's been very happy. And I, once I got the (inaudible ) car, I, it was my means of independence, really. If I hadn't had that, I, I don't really know what I would have done. And I joined different organizations for the disabled such as Disabled Drivers' Organization and uhm, the Northern Ireland Paraplegic Association which promotes work for the disabled. And uhm, I got involved with their committees there ah, from time to time, and ah, I think it made me see that other way that can set me really dwell in my disability, but it, it made me see that there's other people that are often worse off than I was. And, ah, I, I enjoyed the different activities that they ran and the different sporting activities and traveled a little with the Paraplegic Association to England and Scotland and then the different sporting events. 

01:14:30
PROF. MALCOLM BROWN  How do you find society generally and their attitudes toward people who have some disability? 

01:14:40
IRENE PALMER I think the attitude of people is much better now than it was 8, and say, 10, 15 years ago. I think because the problems of the disabled are publicized better now, that people have a greater understanding towards disabled folk. And also I, I think people were rather shy to ask if they could help disabled people or, and they were rather embarrassed, even maybe coming up and speaking to them from time to time and I guess a disabled person would show them and you know, not want to bother, but that's certainly is a thing of the past, really. A lot of people even just out of curiosity once they get talking to me, we'd talk about my disability and it's not that they are nosy but they are genuinely interested on the problems that I have and my feelings towards disability. 

01:15:35
PROF. MALCOLM BROWN Yes. And social workers, what are they be like? 

01:15:40
IRENE PALMER They didn't seem to try and solve any of these problems in any way. They would have asked the questions of what the problems were and I would have told them and that would've been it until the next time. They came again and ask the same questions. If there had been any aids that I had been needing and I would've told them whether I thought I required and, ah, the next time they came along, the aids were still being required. I wouldn't have received them or, those were the type of problems. It was, sometimes you felt almost useless ah, asking for help because you never really receive the help in the end. 

01:16:15
PROF. MALCOLM BROWN The next interview is with a wife and mother who has multiple sclerosis with a generally fairly slow deterioration in health. She has known of her condition for 11 years. The diagnosis had been made some considerable time before, that but have not been shared with her. 

01:16:40
CAROL ASPINALL 

01:16:40
CAROL ASPINALL I knew there was something wrong by the way he was reacting. And he was being too nice to me, do you know what I mean. I mean he's not always nice to me, but ah, I just knew that was something was wrong and didn't know what it was and I was very frightened. I think it's better to be told. 

01:16:55
PROF. MALCOLM BROWN  Yes. Have, have you talked with your husband about that? 

01:17:00
CAROL ASPINALL Yes, I did afterwards. I was very angry at the time when I did find out that he had known. Uhm, then we did talk about it and I realized that he didn't tell me for the very best of motives. He was afraid that, uhm, well, not that I would do something silly. Apparently, once a long, many years ago, I had seen somebody just diagnosed with MS and I said that if that ever happen to me I would kill myself knowing what was going to happen. I may have said but I don't remember it. But ah, he wanted to find out all he could about the disease first before I was told about it. And then I say, say, I've find out by accident and talked with my doctor and, and I knew and it was a relief to know. 

01:17:40
PROF. MALCOLM BROWN  Yes. Then has it progressively got worse? 

01:17:50
CAROL ASPINALL Oh, yes. I was working. I led a more or less normal life. I got a job actually after. I have the disease though, I, I didn't know at the time that I have it. And I worked for it going on nine years. 

01:18:00
PROF. MALCOLM BROWN So, you've been in a wheelchair for two years? 

01:18:05
CAROL ASPINALL Yes. 

01:18:05
PROF. MALCOLM BROWN And, and you haven't been working outside the home... (crosstalk) 

01:18:10
CAROL ASPINALL No, I haven't. 

01:18:10
PROF. MALCOLM BROWN ...for that same period? Yes. What has it been like for you over this time? 

01:18:15
CAROL ASPINALL You mean the, the last two years? Well, it was shattering. And I think partly because it happened so quickly and I have to readjust to the MS that hit me all over again. I've got MS and this isn't going to get any better. And I have been slowly and steadily deteriorating over the past two years. But, I think I'm beginning to come to terms with it a bit more again now. But, when it happened, it was devastating for the whole family. Well, I try to be cheerful. Uhm, my friends would all tell you that I'm very cheerful and say, oh, you know, she's marvelous and have coped well and all those sort of thing. But a lot of it is an act. You tend not to put on the act quite so much with your family, but I don't like to go on crying. But I do my crying on my own when I get depressed by that. But I think I'm very snappy with him sometimes, short-tempered and I, I feel that the children should perhaps do more to help. And ah, I would be crossed(ph) with him sometimes. (crosstalk) 

01:19:20
PROF. MALCOLM BROWN Hmm. 

01:19:20
CAROL ASPINALL And then I'll shut up and then I'd apologize and say I'm just had bad day and then they say it's okay, you know, we understand." 

01:19:25
PROF. MALCOLM BROWN Yes. I mean, have you and your husband ever really sort of talked together about what it's like for both of you? Or did you just get this by implication? 

01:19:35
CAROL ASPINALL I think more just by implication. We haven't really talked very deeply about it. You know, if I, if I try to say to him this is dreadful for you. He says, "No, it's all right". You know, he tends to, he's not a person I think who finds it easy to share his feelings. 

01:19:50
PROF. MALCOLM BROWN Does he ever say is it dreadful for you? 

01:19:55
CAROL ASPINALL No. 

01:19:55
PROF. MALCOLM BROWN  So, I mean, are you really sort of cold with one another, a little bit to, to avoid talking about it? Would you. (crosstalk) 

01:20:05
CAROL ASPINALL I think we are, perhaps, yes, yes. Maybe because, because of this is too painful just, that we don't want to. And it's, it's not knowing what's going to happen in the future. It's frightening. So, we'd better not to talk about it and just sort of think and hope that things will get better 

01:20:20
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN  Yes, yes. I mean that, that does this sort of give you any fears? 

01:20:30
CAROL ASPINALL Well, I am afraid. I try, I just don't think about it, (crosstalk) 

01:20:35
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Uh hmm. 

01:20:35
CAROL ASPINALL you know, I try not to think what's going to happen to me. (crosstalk) 

01:20:35
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Uh hmm. 

01:20:35
CAROL ASPINALL Will I end up in a home? Will I end up totally paralyzed or what? I just don't think about it. 

01:20:40
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Uh hmm 

01:20:40
CAROL ASPINALL I just take, you know, the, you know this day by day. Then definitely it's the only way to really to live. 

01:20:50
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Yes. 

01:20:50
CAROL ASPINALL Just get through each day. 

01:20:50
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Yes. So, then is, is there anyone that you're able to talk to and say what its really like... (crosstalk) 

01:20:55
CAROL ASPINALL Hmm. 

01:20:55
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN ...for you sometimes? 

01:21:00
CAROL ASPINALL I do have friends that I can talk to much, not may be anybody. The people who would understand, (coughs) excuse me, they have MS themselves and I don't like to burden them with, with how I feel. And the, but that mean there are, there's, there's one particular girl that I can talk to. She is very intuitive and with no, you know, she would say, how are you and I say, fine. And she said, are you just saying that or are you fine? I say, I'm not. And, ah, to say what's happening and I can talk to her. But I did know she has it herself, but she's very well at the minute and I feel I'm not laying it on her too much. 

01:21:45
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Has it made you very sad sometimes? 

01:21:50
CAROL ASPINALL Yes. It has. 

01:21:50
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN So, but you sort of cry alone? 

01:21:55
CAROL ASPINALL Uh hmm. 

01:21:55
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Uh hmm. Yes. Do, do you wish that you and your husband, so there could be more unless he's not (inaudible ) about it or. (crosstalk) 

01:22:06
CAROL ASPINALL I think that he would find that too disturbing. 

01:22:10
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Yes. 

01:22:10
CAROL ASPINALL I really do know what sort of person he is. 

01:22:10
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Yes. 

01:22:10
CAROL ASPINALL I, I think it might, uhm, well, I think he can keep going the way we are at the minute, you know. It might break something in him. I'm not explaining that very well. 

01:22:30
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN You, you, you mean you think that he's un, under quite a lot of tension... (crosstalk) 

01:22:35
CAROL ASPINALL I think he is. 

01:22:35
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN ...or stress at... (crosstalk) 

01:22:35
CAROL ASPINALL Uh-huh. 

01:22:35
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN ...the moment. 

01:22:40
CAROL ASPINALL Because he has a very stressful job as well. And uhm, he's just under, he's just stress, stress, stress. (crosstalk) 

01:22:45
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Stress. 

01:22:45
CAROL ASPINALL The way he, he doesn't, he doesn't really show it you know. But I worry, I sort of think, you know, and what stress can do and he's at a dangerous age that sort of thing (laughs) that... (crosstalk) 

01:22:55
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Yes. 

01:22:55
CAROL ASPINALL ...I worry about. 

01:23:00
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN So, how does he relax? 

01:23:00
CAROL ASPINALL He usually falls asleep in the chair every evening when he comes home from work and I used to be crossed about this and think we never talk at night. I just let him sleep. 

01:23:10
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Uh hmm. 

01:23:10
CAROL ASPINALL He flies model airplanes, but he hasn't been able to do this last summer because we've been building on the house and it's been a lot of work to be done with decorating. But I'm hoping he'll get back to it this summer 'coz he goes away all day, Sunday and that's with his friends and it's a rare, you know, a escape for him. 

01:23:25
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Yes, yes. How do you sleep? 

01:23:30
CAROL ASPINALL Oh, I sleep a lot. 

01:23:30
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Yes. 

01:23:30
CAROL ASPINALL I mean I sleep a lot during the day and I sleep perfectly well at night. I don't know if it's part of the disease or not. I just, I'm going through a phase of doing a lot of sleeping at the minute. It gets partly boredom because you can't read all day and watch television. I just sleep. (laughs) 

01:23:50
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN And, and you haven't really felt like unburdening yourself... (crosstalk) 

01:23:50
CAROL ASPINALL  Uh hmm. 

01:23:55
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN ...or whether it's really out for you to... (crosstalk) 

01:23:55
CAROL ASPINALL No, not really. 

01:23:55
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN (inaudible ). 

01:23:58
CAROL ASPINALL I think it's because I'll be, I'm afraid of breaking down. 

01:24:00
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN In crying, you mean, yes. Is it, is very important that you can predict(ph) them? 

01:24:05
CAROL ASPINALL Uh hmm. 

01:24:05
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Yes. Do you feel you need, need to be strong with other people? 

01:24:10
CAROL ASPINALL  Yes. 

01:24:15
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Uh hmm. 

01:24:15
CAROL ASPINALL I don't know why (laughs), but I do it. 

01:24:15
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN  Uh hmm. Is it 'coz you're thinking about them partly or? 

01:24:20
CAROL ASPINALL I don't know. Not really. I analyzed it, I just, if I start to cry, I always apologize (laughs). 

01:24:30
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN The third interview is with a young lady in her mid-20s. She had been in excellent health. At work, one morning, she felt a tingling in one arm and then in the other. She went to hospital. By early that afternoon, she was completely paralyzed from the neck down. 

01:24:55
FIONA PRENTICE 

01:24:55
FIONA PRENTICE Well, I was told then on Thursday night that I would never move again. That if I was lucky, I would get half an inch back in my spine that would give me slight movement in my arms, but that was all. 

01:25:10
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Yes. How, how did you respond to that? 

01:25:10
FIONA PRENTICE I didn't give up. And I thought the doctors had. They were very blunt and, ah, did not give you any sort of reassurance to, or give you anything to hold on to. They just sort of told you the bad news, walked off and left you on your own. Oh, I cried and the normal sort of things and your whole future just as destroyed. You know, you've no future told to look forward to. You know, everything is just taken away from me in the, you wonder where you're going from here. 

01:25:50
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN  Yeah. How do you feel that people have treated you? 

01:25:55
FIONA PRENTICE  Uhm, a lot of, everybody around me has been very good and very kind and understanding. They don'ts, they don't really know what its like to be like this. They understand as far as they can. People generally have been within the medical services and things. Busy with a lot of their own occupations and can only lend a limited time to you. So, in the sense that you would love may be to just to sit down and talk to somebody. Sometimes, you just can't do that because they haven't got the time and the five minutes that they would spend with you makes an awful a lot of difference just to somebody to sit and listen. You know answer any queries that you have. And because that you are paralyzed even from the neck down or chest down, doesn't mean that your mind is any less than what it was which is a lot of people's faults. They think that because your paralyzed that you're, you're mentally affected as well which my brain isn't. It's, it's as alert as it ever was, may be even more. 

01:27:20
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Yes. Could you give us some examples of how people have tried to take control of your life for you? 

01:27:25
FIONA PRENTICE When you're in hospital at the start, you know, when things start at first, people are inclined to tell you what to do and what the way that you should run your life. You know, I was told, and at the start I had planned to get married in June. And have my own house and everything ready for that. And because it's a house with stairs then I was told by one person to sell it. Well, I'm lucky in the sense that I've not that shy, if I need anything that I'll ask for it. But a lot of people are, are inclined to, to make you feel that your, you're asking for the moon. You're asking for something that you're not entitled to. You know that to, to make you feel like small like a beggar sort of thing, you know, degrade you. You know because it, if you're asking for something to help yourself, they, if it's not sort of, if it's anything I did the way, they don't want to know. You know, a lot of people just don't put themselves out. 

01:28:40
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Will this be the social services and the nursing services or? 

01:28:45
FIONA PRENTICE Well, the likes of, in the hospital, I was uhm, I am a smoker and would not have any power use in my arm and things. The nursing staff and that's very, very busy and simple things like that you know to ask for them a cigarette or you know, it seems as if you're asking for a world cruise. You know, it seems so hard to get... (crosstalk) 

01:29:10
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Uh hmm. 

01:29:10
FIONA PRENTICE ...plus, you know, even you meal time is not, I had a, my meal was sitting in front of me and I had to wait 20 minutes for a nurse to come and feed that to me. By that time, your dinner ruined and it's freezing, but you're hungry and you need to eat. You know, I mean, you'd really, you can feed like pulling your hair right? At the end of it, and social services and things really you just trying to push it to their way of thinking and their way of going rather than asking you what you want. And letting you live as full a life as you can. It just changed the whole, the whole aspect to your future. You know, whether I would even be able to stay with my boyfriend. I mean, it wouldn't be very fair on him if I hadn't there totally paralyzed. I mean, he couldn't have coped with that. And he wouldn't any, had any sort of a life at all. 

01:30:20
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Has your disability, you, affected your sexual feelings at all? 

01:30:25
FIONA PRENTICE Well, I think of all, you know, the, the wants and don't wants still all there, but it, it will effect that sort of side of it as well, you know because I have a, I haven't full power and control of bladder and things and just different way things like that. I don't know an awful lot about it as yet. I want to find out... (crosstalk) 

01:30:50
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Uh hmm. 

01:30:50
FIONA PRENTICE ...but that sort of angle is very hard to find out about because nobody ever has suggested, you know, would you like to go and see somebody about that sort of thing or somebody can help you and give advice. Nobody ever comes across with that sort of thing if you want it, you have to ask for it. 

01:31:15
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN So, before your illness, I mean, you would have been having a full sexual relationship? 

01:31:20
FIONA PRENTICE Yes. 

01:31:20
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Yes. And, and that's gone now? 

01:31:25
FIONA PRENTICE Uh-huh. 

01:31:25
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Yes. 

01:31:25
FIONA PRENTICE It has. 

01:31:25
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Yes. Has there been nobody that's talked to you about that? 

01:31:30
FIONA PRENTICE No. Anything I have wanted to know, I have to ask and nobody has either and suggested may be to, that arranged me to see somebody. And there's a very few people I think really know an awful about it. There isn't even a, I mean, your own general practitioner wouldn't know a great deal about it either. That may be know bits and pieces, but you actually need somebody that has dealt with all the problems before. There's no sense going to see somebody and have them saying to you, I don't know... (crosstalk) 

01:32:10
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Uh hmm. 

01:32:10
FIONA PRENTICE ...or I'm not sure. 

01:32:10
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN So, did you your boyfriend consciously decide not to have a sexual relationship until you'd got more control or? 

01:32:20
FIONA PRENTICE Well, there is a lot of things needed and looking into about it. I mean, I certainly couldn't afford to become pregnant... (crosstalk) 

01:32:30
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Uh hmm. 

01:32:30
FIONA PRENTICE  that as much as maybe I would like to, but it would only 'coz complications and hold back or destroy any progress that might be there at the minute. The main emphasis is on getting as fit and as healthy as possible. And you've to look into then to likes of culture, contraception and things like that. What can use or what you can't use. As far as pills, and those concerned, I mean it can cause what happen to me already, you know, so, you have to find out what's right... (crosstalk) 

01:33:10
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Uh hmm. 

01:33:10
FIONA PRENTICE ...and not lying for yourself. So, it's better just to keep out of the danger zone. You know, and I was trying to keep myself perked up and unhappy and all the rest of it to keep him up above it. It was hard at times. 

01:33:30
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Have you thought the need to put on a braver, happier front when you're actually experiencing? 

01:33:35
FIONA PRENTICE  I don't like sit and cry and gone nearly because it's not helping me. And if you, you get yourself down and then you're crying all the time, you're really depressed and it's not helping yourself. You just don't want to do your things then and it holds you back and therefore, really I don't have time for it. And I think my main thing is that you said to yourself was what horror have I done anybody when different people there have killing and maiming and all these here. And me, I just went to work and come home and why me? You know, when all the rest of them were walking about, but I've got it now and I have to, to deal with it. 

01:34:35
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN The final interview is with a young family man, who suffered a serous industrial accident while working at a carpet factory, both legs were pulled into a machine with a subsequent double amputation below the knee. 

01:34:55
IAN CAMPBELL 

01:34:55
IAN CAMPBELL I looked at it as an accident that happened to me, but you know, to see them my legs just taken away a whole a lot of other things like what you used to be able to do. And I can, you know, sort of can't get up and walk outside or drive around here and there. You know, just sort of a lot has been taken away from me. After, I got out of the hospital, the first time in August, in the August. In the room, we had to set up a single bed for myself here in the living room. It couldn't seem to be right. You know, that morning I was gonna get ready when I sort had to stay down here. And I sort of felt that time when I thought to myself, there are, this is it, you know as far as the sexual side of our marriage goes, it's just been completely and utterly killed off, you know. And sort of while I was in, no, no link seem to be in very good spirits, but found out since then that she's been going through. I think that I had a lot more than what I have. I think may be yet the time that what was needed for somebody to comfort her. 

01:36:15
MRS. CAMPBELL At the start, it was very hard 'coz he was hard to keep, you know when I wept and I felt I had to be brave and when I come home I had to be brave for the children and it was very hard. Hard enough to, you know, to get it out of my system and you know, without people knowing how I really felt sometimes, you know, when it sort of kept bottling and bottling and you know. And in the end I came around. They started to tell me that he saw his foot and it's badly damaged. And it didn't move. If he'd be able, you know, if it's gonna be any good to him and the doctor that overheard the conversation. 'Coz I knew what had happened, but I didn't want to, to be the one to say. So, he can move around he said that he just said he will hard times to move both your legs. You know and then it was feel slightly stranger for him. But even though, I don' think it really sunk in, you know, but then really I was just silent maybe I really told him, you know. 

01:37:10
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Did the doctor stay with you for a while talking about it or did he leave. (crosstalk) 

01:37:15
MRS. CAMPBELL He really was, he stood for a while and then he talked to me. He said that it's not the end of the world, you know. And things can be done and, and eventually, he'll be able to walk again. And you know, for us he's saying, I guess, he's trying sort to comfort him, but I think at that time time he doesn't really know what for him if he's really any comfort. 

01:37:35
IAN CAMPBELL Not really, no. It was quite a shock like whenever I lifted up the bed, closing the thing, you know. I didn't really know what to think. Well, you were feeling on before, one of the whenever we went to bed like any other normal people there you have sex and all, but now, it's, it's totally different. Uhm, it's not the same and ah, it has dulled the idea of sex, full stop. Uhm, it's definitely, sort of changed the attitude towards sex. Ah, it used to be, you know, ah, sort of, you know, what was dominated and part of one time, but now I couldn't care less about it, yet towards it. You know, and sort of even when it does happen you always feel instead of being happy at the end it's always feels like a disappointment to you. Almost you know what as sad as completely changed just surely because of the outlook. You know that, that just not just being able to stand, stand up and things like that. It's may be not it ashamed may be it's being more embarrassment may be a better word for it. 

01:38:55
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Is it because you feel that your wife doesn't fancy you like she used to? 

01:39:00
IAN CAMPBELL  Well that could be one of the, the main points of it. Whenever, I was all sort of together, we were more or less a see 'em hate than whenever we went on a date, you know, dancing and one thing and all or even just walking about together, you know. We're sort of able to talk eye to eye, but now it's whenever you're going up to bed at night, I sat down at the floor looking at her because I have no other way I getting in there except on my hands. You know, when I'm, I'm off the chair of chair of course, but with, you know, it's, it's makes you feel just sort of, I've got to (inaudible ), you know. Eventually, I will walk again, and I'm determined to do it, but, just that it doesn't sort of help. We had them enough to take thing. 

01:39:55
MRS. CAMPBELL Basically, we are trying to see him, you know. I mean, I treat him just to see him, I mean I don't by any means pity him, you know, because, I mean, if I'm angry about him doing something, I would tell him. (crosstalk) 

01:40:05
IAN CAMPBELL Uh hmm. 

01:40:05
MRS. CAMPBELL So we get over it, the fact that he is sitting there when he could be helping them or make him help, I mean, that type of thing, you know. So I don't dwell there so. And I, I do let him drive himself put in(ph), well, I don't think that would get us anywhere at all. 

01:40:20
IAN CAMPBELL Oh, no. 

01:40:20
MRS. CAMPBELL You know, so basically, Ian and I, ourselves, are just to see him as well he's were and not sensitive and we just. (crosstalk) 

01:40:25
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN  In his early days, you thought you had to be strong, did you? 

01:40:30
MRS. CAMPBELL Yes. Well, I always felt I was a very weak, low person and dependent a lot in the end, but I found out since this is something like, you know, deep down that I'm strong-willed and I didn't realize it that I've become very strong and well, ah, determined. At the start I think we'll never left the hospital. Ian kinda rejected me, emotionally me rejecting him. You know, it made me feel as if he didn't want me to be there at all, you know. And it seems, the children, he wouldn't let me take them up at all. And they were threatened, something terrible for him, you know. I mean, every night, every second, eventually after ten days, I decided, I was taken them up sort of, I have to just say, well, if either take them there or he's never going to accept the fact that they're going to see him this way, you know? So I took them up and, I mean, they just treated him as normal and, I mean that, that was their daddy and they loved him and they were just so glad to see he's still there sort of thing, which I think helped them and Ian both because he did seem that he didn't, sort of thing will cause, you know, like, he's not my daddy anymore sort of thing and that really helped him. And after that I have no problems with the children and when they come home, I mean, even his teacher he would talked about how proud he is of his daddy because his daddy can do this and, you know, the things that his daddy is going to do when he gets his, his limbs and things like that, which has, has helped him a lot, I think as well. When I talk about the times, like, before you realized that I didn't reject you... (crosstalk) 

01:42:15
Ian Campbell Yes. 

01:42:15
MRS. CAMPBELL ...it was a sort of a confusion because we both felt as if we were rejecting each other. And at the end of that, that eventually, (inaudible ) but you're doing but one of the problems to you was that we never, ever got a chance to be on our own for, well, over a month, I think, after the accident, it was before or it was before we actually had a... (crosstalk) 

01:42:35
IAN CAMPBELL That was true. 

01:42:35
MRS. CAMPBELL ...actually we that certain time entirely on our own. Worry that sometimes Ian doesn't talk things over, which I think, he should do, you know, and not, you know, I'm always afraid of him bottling things up too much, you know, which I don't think would be either and, you know, as I, I find it hard to visualize what the future sort of, going to be like as well. I think that is one of the hardest things, really. You know, trying to, to picture what it's going to be like once he, he gets (inaudible ) and once he's walking and biking, you know, wherein that nothing more sort of gonna happen. You know, I think that is, I mean, after you've come through something(ph), that, that's your, you've, you're very weary all the time if something else, sort of, he got to a stage where he feel he can't accept anything more going wrong, which I think doesn't mean inferior. You know... (crosstalk) 

01:43:35
IAN CAMPBELL Too much said. 

01:43:35
MRS. CAMPBELL ...that, you know, sort of free of anything else, sort of going all night that. (crosstalk) 

01:43:40
IAN CAMPBELL You are always want, want a protective thing, you know, but, it's hard, you know, to, let go and sort of think freely, you know what, 'coz you're always sort a thinking well, you know, what's in the next quarter type of thing, you know, we go to (inaudible ) this time or, something like that, you know. 

01:44:00
MRS. CAMPBELL And so, with your parents, I mean, the immediate family is the worst, I think you always put a real fearsome for them, you know, (crosstalk) 

01:44:10
IAN CAMPBELL Fear something. I don't know. 

01:44:10
MRS. CAMPBELL I mean, you never consumed, ah, even from the very start. I've never really let them see how I felt. I think it's deep down you're trying to protect them as well because, I mean, not too later, Brian(ph) would be feeling the same sort of things that you're feeling although, when that boy is doing (inaudible ) really only involves Ian and I, that's really have to live with it, but I think, you know, me and Ian first for a fact, never has let his father or his brother and if them really even that out, I knew if it was dying moments, when they have come in, that's always been a cheerful side has partaken. You know, this... (crosstalk) 

01:44:45
IAN CAMPBELL Hmm. That's true. 

01:44:45
MRS. CAMPBELL ...being free sort of thing, ah, whether he is trying to protect them or what, I don't know. 

01:44:50
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN  Do you feel you're able to be honest with one another or do you still put a little bit of phase on it with one another which is. (crosstalk)

01:45:05
MRS. CAMPBELL He saves really eventually let me... (crosstalk) 

01:45:10
IAN CAMPBELL No, I'm not, that was it. 

01:45:10
MRS. CAMPBELL ...know that we can honest with one another, I'm totally honest and. (crosstalk) 

01:45:10
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Uh-huh. 

01:45:10
IAN CAMPBELL  No, you know, there were times like, that you know, you don't really have to put fears on (inaudible ) Ian you were said, "Oh, I go out for that early." And you know, you can sort of feel there is he for a while again, you know and, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:45:25
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN  You're quite depressed? 

01:45:30

01:45:50
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN  Would you say that it has brought you closer together and helped you to understand one another more? 

01:46:00
MRS. CAMPBELL Yes, I think it has but there's a minute that definitely hasn't pulled us apart. In anyway, I would say, we're closer and more understanding that... (crosstalk) 

01:46:10
IAN CAMPBELL Yeah. 

01:46:10
MRS. CAMPBELL ...more than we ever were, really. You know, (crosstalk) 

01:46:10
IAN CAMPBELL Well, that's... (crosstalk) 

01:46:10
MRS. CAMPBELL  uhm, it definitely has brought us closer then. 

01:46:15
IAN CAMPBELL ...I would say that, you know, because, you know, whenever you want to try and talk about something, that's, it seems to be that but easier than it was before, you know. Uhm, I think that I understand really a bit more now and I can sort a, you know, visualize and... (crosstalk) 

01:46:35
MRS. CAMPBELL Hmm. 

01:46:35
IAN CAMPBELL ...and (inaudible ) mean what she's thinking and that I, I'm close to sort understand that then I can go on and say, "Look, this is how I feel." You know, that if we can sort of talk this over and we'll be able to achieve something out of it, you know. Whereas before, you know, we sort a just want then one or (inaudible ) me at the decision, you know, for a while and that was just at the (inaudible ) ultimately? 

01:47:00
MRS. CAMPBELL Uh hmm. 

01:47:00
IAN CAMPBELL I mean it's. (crosstalk) 

01:47:00
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN Do you feel what showed in your mind now that, that she loves you and loves you as much as she did before? (crosstalk) 

01:47:05
IAN CAMPBELL Oh yes, definitely. Uhm, I feel the words, I mean that is and, and it couldn't be any stronger, I don't think. And, uhm, well do (inaudible ) her, maybe it doesn't show anything of it at times, sir, but you know, that is, that has definitely brought us closer together and I think whenever you're unable to understand the person better I like that, you know, the relationship does, it's somewhat better. 

01:47:30
PROFESSOR MALCOLM BROWN  Drawing upon these interviews, we look now at the major emotional reactions to physically handicapped and how the helping person might best be involved in the intervention process. Thank you. 

01:47:50
 Here are some major considerations; A crisis of identity. A physically handicapped can have a dramatic effect upon us. Many of the elements that contribute to making us the person that we are, may change and we lose that sense of self-image and of knowing ourselves in relation to others. Concept of loss. Closely associated with the crisis of identity as a sense of loss and a grieving for that which has gone. In many ways, this is similar to the death of someone precious to us. Feelings associated with this may include denial, anger, shame, guilt, embarrassment and depression. Low self-esteem. We live in a society that places high value on youthfulness, beauty, health and success. Society stigmatizes physically handicapped. Handicapped people may be avoided, pitied or patronized. Such attitudes often contribute to the low self-esteem that the person is feeling anyway. Perceptions of sexuality. Society too has attitudes towards sexuality and sexual activity, which are not helpful. Sex is not for the old, the mentally-ill, a criminal or the physically handicapped. Such attitudes are often so much and into a part of us, that we act quite unconsciously as though they were true even when so very often, they are not. Loss of control. Alongside a physical disability, it is all too easy for others to think that there has been some loss of mental faculties as well. There are tendencies to take over and take decisions for people with so should be taken for themselves even professional people often think that they know best but they do not. Fear of the future. With serious injury or illness causing physical handicapped the common factor is a fear of the future. "This big thing has happened to me, will there be anymore, what will happen next? What will tomorrow bring? Will I be able to cope?" Such feelings are in no way abnormal. Coping, Adjustment, Acceptance. Often to talk about helping people to accept they're handicapped and all that it means shows little appreciation of how devastating an injury or an illness can be. Often, for many, for awhile, it is just a matter of coping. Day by day, or even an hour at the time of tolerating both the physical and the emotional pain, really getting better requires strength and will and determination. Not everybody makes it. Skilled counseling can help. And now, aspects of skilled intervention; Use of reality. In order for people to make decisions in their lives that are right for them, they do need to know their realities, people are entitled to know the truth, the truth about their illness or injury, the truth about it's implications, about it's prognosis, as far as this is known and about the resources and help that are available. Empathetic approach. Being empathetic means being alongside a person in their need. We do not judge, we do not force, we appreciate and value people for what they are. They are able to be completely honest with us and when we are with them, we are there totally for them. Going at clients pace. It is often easy for the hoping person to see what should be done and to be in patient for results. It is important to remember that it is not our problem and our solution or resolution. This must mean that we need to go at their pace and not expect them to go at ours. Keeping client central to decision taking. There is a tendency to take over and do for or to tell the handicapped person what to do. Decision taking is a central core of living and people do have the right and the responsibility to take their own decisions in respect of their own lives. Helping others to be sensitive and skilful. In respect of the physically handicapped, the counselor is likely to be one of a multi-disciplinary team. Part of our job is to help other professionals to understand and appreciate the patient's needs and relate to him in a way that is consistent with human dignity, that is reality-based and which keeps him central to his life and to the decisions taken. Assistance for the family. Well, much of our concern is for the handicapped person, others that might be very much in need of help are the other family members. It must not be assumed that all they want to do is to help the patient. Their emotional needs might be even greater. The whole family situation should be assessed and help given as and where it is needed. Appropriate use of resources. Some physically handicapped people need a great deal of help and often this is a available, to get it, however, can be a complex process. Many agencies, both statutory and voluntary are involved. The helping person has to be an expert in knowing of the resources and how to get them. The concept shared in this program are the avail of too much more fully in the notes that are sent out with it.
