Aquarius HEALTH CARE MEDIA In Harmony with the Heart 

00:00:25
Morris (inaudible ) heaven and Morris body is in coffin under the ground. 

00:00:35
He is in heaven right now, probably having a lot of fun but he is still kinda misses me. 

00:00:45
I was Seven and a half, my dad had died and he was 39. 

00:00:50
They asked what happened? How did he die? and Why? You know, why couldn't someone have cured him. 

00:00:55
She had cancer and she didn’t think that she would live long. And she did not want Larry to know or either want that her children to know at that point. 

00:01:10
Remembering Families Talk About Death 

00:01:15
ROZANNE FRIEDMAN Grief Therapist What makes it so difficult to talk about death to children is the fact that it is the one thing we don't have any control over and to be able to express that to a child, bring out our own vulnerabilities, that's one reason, another reason is that we don't like to see our children in pain. We like to give them answers concrete answers and a lot about death, we just don't have those answers. 

00:01:40
A few days after Christmas, um... I was came bouncing down the stairs as a 5 year old, and there was a family friend at the bottom of the stairs, who told me that, that God came and took my father. I spent weeks looking for my father and waiting for him to come home little that I know how much my life would change at that point. 

00:02:15
ROZANNE FRIEDMAN Adults who were not told about death, when they were children and were held back from understanding what was going on and just treated like this as a adult business not children business are added disadvantage. 

00:02:25
DAVID TECHNER Funeral Director, Educator It's important for kids to say goodbye when somebody dies with a same reason, it's important for adults to say goodbye. It's very hard to go on without having some sense of service, ceremony and closure. 

00:02:40
I had to allow Larry 

00:02:45
It's really sad when a child experiences death and a such a close death, at such a young age, but death is part of life, and we all lose people. And how you handle that is very, very important in your life. 

00:03:25
And I think what we have tried to tell our kids is that our bodies are just a small part of who we are, and our spirits are much more important than our bodies. I think I have had those kinds of conversations but I haven't painted like a pearly gates and the angles on clouds. 

00:03:35
ROZANNE FRIEDMAN Children loved to believe in angels they loved to believe in spiritual things and angels give it some sense and some security and makes it less abstract. 

00:03:50
Heaven is like a dream, you can do whatever you want without being told to. 

00:04:00
Like in the middle you will god and he will talk to you, and then he will show you to where your family is like, all our ancestors and stuff and then you can meet them. 

00:04:10
KEVIN FARRELL He looks exactly the same, but he has wings. 

00:04:15
And is he happy or sad? 

00:04:20
KEVIN FARRELL Happy. 

00:04:20
LARRY BREWER When I sit and pray, and just think about my mother, I feel, I feel relaxed, I'm sorry to say, because I know, that I lost somebody very, very close to me, and it is nobody ever that can fill that you know, that space. 

00:04:50
DAVID TECHNER If a child is not involved in saying goodbye, they are going to have a lifetime of being incomplete, never having had that sense of being a part, I mean they were part of a life, but they weren't part of the death, and therefore it is very difficult to become part of that memory picture. 

00:05:10
It was very important to me that when my wife died that my family members would become involved in the funeral as much as possible. I do not want my experience as a 5-year-old, when my father died to ever be repeated again. I included my son in everything, he was in my arms, and shared this very emotional time with us. He shared as much as his maturity would allow him to share. 

00:05:50
DAVID TECHNER I think what happens with children is, is that there are certain things that they can, and cannot comprehend and it is really hard for a child at age 3 or 4 or 5 possibly to really understand the whole concept of spirituality, but they can understand that the body stops working. 

00:06:05
ROZANNE FRIEDMAN You tell children the truth, in the way, in the way that you would tell them anything, you just do it age appropriately, honestly from the heart, and let them know you don't know all the answers, it's that just fine, as long as you are telling them your own truth. 

00:06:25
I didn't want to tell him anything until I had spoken to someone, who could give me some guidance on how to tell a child that he has lost his father. And they told me to just tell him the truth and to and to talk to him about it. He came home from school and I said Kevin I have something to tell you and he said okay, he said, is it good or bad, and I said its bad, it's bad news, and we pulled the chairs up really close and then I told him, I said, you know Kevin, your dad died last night. And so on, he just said um... what happened? And I said well, we don't really know but you know your dad was not healthy and he died in his... now he was in his bed. 

00:07:20
DAVID TECHNER I think from the time, your children are very young they wanted to trust their parents, and their parents want to make sure that their kids feel that sense of trust, so telling kids the honest truth from the beginning would never get you in trouble. 

00:07:35
They lost a neighbor, Moore Bowman(ph) we have been… the Bowmans(ph) have been our neighbors for 10 or 11 years since we have been in this home, and they watch the kids grow up. 

00:07:50
Moore made me happy because he just made me smile every time when I saw him. 

00:07:55
If I want(ph) we just played catch back and forth, then he will say something like we have a game, first one who drops he loses. And then so we keep on going until somebody drops. And say that I dropped and then he will say well, that didn't count. I will give you another chance. 

00:08:10
And he was one of my best friends. 

00:08:15
My mom was picking(ph) some flowers, she was real quiet and I knew, I knew something was going wrong, because my mom whenever she gives she gets real sad she is real quiet. And so, I said mom what's wrong and she said uncle Moore just died. 

00:08:30
My mom told me that Moore died, then I felt like I could cry all the time, but I'm used to it now. 

00:08:45
Losing somebody is just like losing our body apart, because when you break your arm it hurts, and when you lose somebody it hurts. 

00:08:55
I told Larry talk to your mom, just hold her hand and talk to your mom, and he did, and I was surprised what came out of his mouth, mom I'm going to be okay, mom are you ready to go, be with granddad, grandma, mom it's okay, we will be okay. I will be fine. 

00:09:20
LARRY BREWER I felt that… that was only the reason why she was holding on, because she thought that will be too hard for me to lose her, so I guess, once I gave it okay, that's when she let go. 

00:09:40
Then I brought him home, and then we got home, the phone rang and they told me that she had passed and I said Larry and he said (inaudible ) and he came into my room and he says mom died. I said, yes, I felt that she would. 

00:10:05
LARRY BREWER And then I believed, I cried, but it wasn't like a cry of sorrow, it was like a kind of relief like she is not suffering anymore. 

00:10:20
Being around your loved ones, when they are passing, helps and I think children should be allowed to be a part of the process. 

00:10:30
DAVID TECHNER Today a lot of people are dying at home, you have hospice situations, kids are part of the dying process as well as part of the death, so I think that it becomes a necessity for parents to be much more open because the dying part is more open, and then it's a natural process, the death also be a more open subject when it comes to your kid being a part of it. 

00:10:55
It was a very, very difficult for me losing my father, very difficult, because he went so fast. And the problem that I had being an adult I never got chance to say goodbye. Larry and I discussed that, but with my mother's death, I was with her, until she took the last breath. That's what I wanted Larry to experience. 

00:11:25
LARRY BREWER When I finally found out what was going on, that's when I started really taking advantage of the time I had with her, instead of going outside I might stay all the day. 

00:11:35
DAVID TECHNER When you are going through an illness and you are dealing with the anticipatory grief, you have the luxury of knowing the limits of time and therefore you make that time more meaningful for both the person who is dying and also yourself. 

00:11:50
I would like to have going to the funeral just to see him one last time, before they buried him. 

00:12:00
I felt very sad. I wanted to speak to him and tell him how my day was and all those thoughts that I cannot say. 

00:12:10
ROZANNE FRIEDMAN The importance of rituals is that it does give a child a place in which to go, what do I would do with my feelings. Where…where am I supposed to be in all of this and the rituals give them a place to be. This is how people respond when somebody dies. 

00:12:25
After the... after Morris funeral and relatives were more at the home. The kids went over by themselves. They wanted, they spent half a day making cards and decorating them and picking just the right flowers from our backyard to take over (inaudible ) and so I let them go and just be with her alone. They kind of felt like they were...they were really being helpful and they wanted to help her through that time. 

00:12:55
I just went over there, I gave her hug and a kiss just to make her feel better. 

00:13:05
And he went through and picked out pictures, favorite pictures and pasted them on poster board and then he wrote something underneath each picture and when we went to church to the rectory, Kevin was there. He wasn't excluded from anything and that was their advice. 

00:13:20
DAVID TECHNER I think that there is a message that needs to be communicated that this is although a sad event it's also kind of a event where we can really sit back, reflect and say thanks for what a wonderful life this person had and how lucky we are to have had them. That's a very important message to continue to reinforces. I know you're sad. I know you loved him very much but that's why we need to this, that's why we need to come together as a family, come together as a community and say goodbye. 

00:13:50
ROZANNE FRIEDMAN The cemetery is an important place for children to be because it gives them a sense of closure. This is where the body is. This is what we do at the cemetery. It gives them a place even though they can go anywhere to talk to their loved one. It gives them a visualization and a place to go and this is where they say goodbye. 

00:14:15
When my father died, I was not allowed to go to the cemetery. So I had no closure. 

00:14:25
[sil.] 

00:14:30
My son Sully was two years old at the time of my wife's death and at that age it was very important to keep everything as physical as possible. He will ask me where is my mommy and I can tell him do you remember that your mommy died and he will yes. What happened? And I said do you remember mommy had a disease and he will yes, she had cancer. You know I will say to him Sully do you remember going to the funeral home and he'll say yes. I saw mommy in her casket. 

00:15:15
When Morrie died there was kind of unexpected because that made me think any day now. I could die or I can get really sick and then I started crying because I was scared to die and then my dad came in and he said you're not gonna die, you still have a longtime left, you know in this earth. 

00:15:40
DAVID TECHNER When kid say to me can I die, I always say to them absolutely and I do it very matter of factly(ph) as a matter of fact everything and everybody that lives eventually will die. And then I'll say see this desk, can this desk die? No. See this chair, can this chair die? No. You know you see that bird, can the bird die? Absolutely. Can you see you know and you're talking about trees, now you're talking about things that are alive. And to everything there is a lifespan. What you really want to do kids that are healthy and you know sort of...you know just thinking about it because they just had a death as you want him to understand that there is a process called life and that everybody has an expectancy of living and that becomes you know 80 to 85, 86 years for younger kids right now they say, we could live to 90. I think it's really nice for kids to think about it in that sense, you know why I got long way to go. 

00:16:40
We did have a period I would say a couple of months after Mike(ph) died. When we started seeing some anger in Kevin and I remember that he was just upset. He was angry and...and his temperament changed and one night he and I were really clashing and I..I just said him Kevin what...what is wrong? What is wrong with you and he said I'm mad because my dad died. 

00:17:05
DAVID TECHNER Anger is a wonderful emotion you know anger and guilt are two great emotions. You have to go through the wall to get to the other side and anger and guilt are the wall, knock them down. One brick at a time or one you know one area at a time, deal with those kinds of issues but to ignore them only means that sometime later on you're going to have to deal with it. 

00:17:25
I cannot envision being 12, 11, 10 and losing a mom or dad, I cannot envision that. But having him around me has taught me the pain that kids have. 

00:17:45
LARRY BREWER When my mom first die, I...I had a thought that like I'd been cheated because you know I kept thinking like what if happened to me. And then as I grew up I just realized it that...that they weren't my fault and everything happened for reason. 

00:18:05
I think Larry is accepting that his mother is gone. I... I really do and each day he gets stronger and stronger. 

00:18:20
ROZANNE FRIEDMAN Older children really feel cheated, you know I...I don't understand why this happened? What did I do about it and everybody else, everybody else has the intact perfect family where they've never experienced this that's how children think very concretely. Everybody has this, I don't and...and my family has been cheated and I've been cheated and this has to be handled very carefully because people who feel cheated can carry that their whole life. 

00:18:50
DAVID TECHNER What's really important for us to understand is there is no right way to grieve, there is no wrong way to grieve. Again I've been in this business close to 30 years and nobody has ever given me a prescription to hand down to a family and say this is how you need to grieve for the loss in this particular individual. 

00:19:05
And that was one reason why we did something some people might have felt were strange but like he died on October 28th and his Kevin school had a Halloween party, the day of the week. And Kevin very much wanted to go to the Halloween party and Kevin and I left the funeral home and he went to school and he went to his party with his friends and he was able to joyfully get right into that party. 

00:19:40
ROZANNE FRIEDMAN Children do have a more vivid imagination than adults, children do are able to be sad one minute and happy the next. 

00:19:50
DAVID TECHNER You cannot take the kid out of being a kid. I mean kids do not have the ability to be intense on a 12-hour day. If it's a 10 o'clock funeral in the morning, they are not going to be up at 10 o'clock at night with the same intensity of that. They are gonna need to go play a video game. They are gonna wanna have a friend over there. They're gonna wanna get to the computer. They're gonna wanna make some phone calls. They're gonna want to be kids and so be prepared that kids are kids and you cannot take the kid out of being a kid. 

00:20:25
ROZANNE FRIEDMAN The school responded you know wonderful way, every single child made a card. Kevin did not go to bed that night until he looked at every single card. 

00:20:35
DAVID TECHNER And I try to tell kids, you'll never ever be wrong by reaching out. And they may not that child may not receive you in the way that you've reached out to them, but you've reached out that's all you can do it at that particular point and that's what kids really need is to know that people care about them. 

00:20:55
LARRY BREWER My friends helped me by like being there for me. They didn't know what to say to me a lot time so what they did was just like listen a lot because they...most of my friends haven't experienced death like I had. 

00:21:10
I don't like the idea of when someone dies suddenly you can't talk about them anymore. I...I wanna talk about them. I wanna keep them alive. We have a lot of pictures in my ground house. 

00:21:25
It's very important for them to remember their mother and I will continue to include her spirit in everything we do. 

00:21:40
DAVID TECHNER We have to take somebody's life, celebrated make sure that we again go back to the celebration of life, the celebration of love and the celebration of the legacy that moves on, that's really important for kids. And it's also important to let them know that it's okay to feel sad and that there is you know what life begins anew. This is a new beginning. 

00:22:05
Clearly when you lose the parent at a very, very young age, there is changing feeling overtime, the days when he playing on his soccer team and baseball team and there is no dad on the sidelines, those moments are yet to come. So he hasn't fully experienced everything that goes along with this…this your lifetime experience and I know that. 

00:22:30
Ah...I think it was really as time went on and they were outside and there was no one on the other side of fence that it really became more and more real to them. Even now I think that package is still being wrapped. 

00:22:45
To realize that we need to love our parents, our siblings, our friends, our grandparents we need to love them as much as we possibly can when they are here. Because the bottom line, we are all gonna die. We all gonna die.
