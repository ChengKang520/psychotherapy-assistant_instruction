Return to Practice Interview 2 

00:00:10
UNKNOWN No, we met about 10 months ago I think it was - 

00:00:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:00:15
UNKNOWN - in a studio to talk about why you were seeing clans. 

00:00:20
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:00:20
UNKNOWN And times moved on and I wonder where you are now in that. 

00:00:25
UNKNOWN How you'd spoke to me in February I would have said I'm not going back to counseling. 

00:00:35
UNKNOWN At all? 

00:00:35
UNKNOWN At all. Uhm, because if you remember I was really uncertain about what I was going to do. And I'd-- I think a number of things that happen that gone away during your term to place that my husband and If often visited and it was very special to us. And I've gone in the hope that something haven't change in my life and the whole experience was to say quite clearly everything changes. So that, so that really through me I haven't expected that through me and what happened then is as, as I approach the anniversary of Ron's death I was hanging on to the hope that because it was the second anniversary as the literature suggest. 

00:01:30
UNKNOWN For those 2 years. Yeah. 

00:01:35
UNKNOWN You know, I sort to wake up in the morning I would be fine. Everything would be so sorted and for me that was in, you know, that, that would sort of manifest itself in the right wake up in the morning and Ron would still be alive and it was all about dream. So, it, it was, ah, a real hope fantasy, you know, and part of my head knew that it was a fantasy but I still hang on to the hope. And as the days approach I became more and more anxious and sort of jittery very tearful. I thought I, I can't do any work in this frame of mind. You know, Uhm, my work at College was, was the only periods in the, the week where I felt I was on solid ground. And when I walk up of course everything was the same except about a week or so later. And so well, this is the reality that my life will always remain uncertain that Ron is dead and he can't comeback. That there isn't a miracle. And I-- eh-- eh-- it's although that was, that was little shock to me and that was, that was really was, ah, quite a, a jolt. I'd actually said that, I'd actually said that and it felt much more real and the, the fantasies that I have been relaying on I guess. Uhm, so that was the first, the first time at that time I saw no practice still not from me. And you know, I been working - 

00:03:35
UNKNOWN As a trainer. 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN - as a trainer, uhm, you know, for the past 2-- well 18 months. And there was one particular day when what happened within the class was hugely challenging I have prepare the lesson but the, the events as they unfolded meant that I had to work with what walls in the room which is pretty dramatic and, and, you know, I did the ethical thing I work with, ah, the students and wa-- they will bring gang at that moment. And at the end of that day I thought, hel-- I've held this students as they were experiencing some really difficult emotions and memories. And not just, you know, held one student but a group of students and I though it was the first gleam work that I had that, you know what? If I can do that perhaps I can go back to working on an individual basis. So it sort of switch and it, and it felt, it was a physical experience the sound of, "Oh, my goodness! Yes, I can!" And it was clear as I was that I can't before March and the real sense of it's possible, it's possible. So it's-- and things have sort of tumbled quite-- quickly after that is to write, "Okay, here's my decision, you know, how do I manage it from here on." 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN Because, what I been working in the supervision before that is to-- I want to go back, you know? And also my supervisor was supervising my return to training as well. So this aspects no needs to be that there's a been a shift and this is what I need to be working on. So I think I've made the decision to go back, uhm, but I need a fair few months yet to prepare without it. 

00:06:10
UNKNOWN I'm just thinking when we last met. You were taking about having no capacity for other - 

00:06:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:06:20
UNKNOWN - people's stuff. 

00:06:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:06:20
UNKNOWN And it feels like that experience in college made you realize that actually suddenly you did have - 

00:06:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:06:30
UNKNOWN - that capacity. 

00:06:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. I have the capacity. I-- it, it, it was very tiring, I was glad to get home at the end of that evening. Uhm, and I think part of what I need to be doing is make absolutely certain that when I do go back that I don't just pay leave service to Southcare but I have to be mindful of myself. And that it's still likely totally me, so, you know, it might mean that I-- I use myself in with a small amount of clients until I find my feet. But these are things to, to discuss, you know, uhm, with my supervisor now. Uhm, As his part is opening up it sort of, yeah, I use the word, tumbling that (inaudible ), sense I have the things that really tumbling on and I'm and as much as at time I took make this decision I want to prepare well for the time when I do starts seeing clans again. 

00:07:45
UNKNOWN So you know you can do it. 

00:07:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:50
UNKNOWN It's about managing the impact of you - 

00:07:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:50
UNKNOWN - off to me. 

00:07:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. And it did-- I'm not sure about having chance by the things having for, ah, a purpose but in the middle of all this. I just picked up NAACP research journals and there was a bit of research that, ah, that, that was on and counselor therapist who have been brief and there experience of returning. And, and that was sort of, that was-- oh, so people can get back - 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:08:30
UNKNOWN - I'm not entirely little alone in this. And that was, that was a sort of, "Hoo! Gosh!" I think when we are grief it's, it's quite, uhm, yeah, have the sense of being the only one. 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN So you have... 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN The only counselor whose ever been grief. 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:08:55
UNKNOWN We're in the studio and talking about this. And only this morning we're in the studio and you, ah, doing a demonstration of counseling practice - 

00:09:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:09:05
UNKNOWN - in a session that might have been quite easy to manage but actually was very, very real. And I'm wondering how that left you. 

00:09:20
UNKNOWN Well. It felt very familiar, uhm, part of my concern in I say was brief is that on, ah, I think perhaps I mentioned this before is that I've not, you know, it wasn't just one lost it was the, the loses that were, you know, associated with that and one of them was that I had lost my ability to, ah, counsel other people. But it felt today, "No, it's still there. I can still do it. No, I'm going to have to reflect on it. Yes, I will." You know? Uhm, what was happening for me and what was happening within the relationship that I had but it felt familiar and I had that sense of it hasn't gone it's still here and I might have to do some work, you know, for myself and within supervision for how lost that it was a relief. 

00:10:40
UNKNOWN Right. Right. 

00:10:40
UNKNOWN A relief. Uhm, yeah. 

00:10:45
UNKNOWN So it's just about managing the impact on you. 

00:10:50
UNKNOWN Yes. Yeah. 

00:10:50
UNKNOWN How did you move forward? 

00:10:55
UNKNOWN On me and on clans - 

00:10:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:10:55
UNKNOWN - as well. Yeah. That's the important thing.
