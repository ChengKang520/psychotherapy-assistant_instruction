UWCN University of Wales College, Newport Coleg Prifysgol Cymru, Casnewydd Looking at Counselling School of Social Studies The Client, the Counsellor and the Unsuitable Friend 

00:00:45
MIKE SIMMONS My name is Mike Simmons. I work as course tutor on the certificate stage of the postgraduate counseling program that we ran at the University of Wales College, Newport. What you are about to see is neither a role-play but nor as a counseling. It's not role-play because the person in the role of client isn't actually making anything up. She is working with real issues, but it's not counseling because she is not really my client. She is a colleague, another counselor and she is simply working with me to make this tape. The session lasts for approximately 30 minutes, you'll have the chance to watch it through once as it happened and then you will see it again with the commentary from the client and from myself. We hope that this commentary will help to stimulate thought and discussion among those who watch the tape. This is not a perfect piece of work. So there is plenty to talk about. How much you use this tape, on our course we do a great deal of skills practice in traits with a client, a counselor and an observer. You are inevitably forced in to the role of observer while watching this tape and you might find it useful to take full advantage of that role. The sorts of question you might like to ask yourself while you are watching it are what do you think are the most significant therapeutic interventions? What are the least helpful ones? If this was a real session, how do you think it needed to progress? And lastly and perhaps most importantly what do you think you might have said to this client that I didn't say and what do you think the impact of that line to have been? 

00:02:35
What do you think are the most significant therapeutic interventions? What are the least helpful ones? If this was a real session, how do you think it needed to progress? What might you have said? 

00:02:35
MIKE SIMMONS Perhaps the best plan is to watch the session for the first time, while making notes just as if you are watching a live session. And then to compare those notes with the commentary that accompanies the second showing. Almost certainly you'll notice things that the client and the counselor don't refer to and this might well form the basis for further discussion. It is worth saying that this is not a tape that is being made to demonstrate basic counseling skills, though they are clearly present and for that present we don't see it is being particularly useful for people in very early part of their training. This is a tape that I had showed to students who are well established on our certificate course and were already able to identify the basic skills. And also who had some sense of familiarity with more advanced skill shown in this video. I might be thinking of showing it to students who done 60 or 70 hours of training perhaps. We've made this tape as a demonstration of one counselors approach and I am that counselor. I work from a client centre perspective majority(ph) and skilled help a model, certainly informs the way I work or at least the way in which I think about my work. I found this model particularly helpful when I think I'm loosing focus in someway. You can suggest that it provides a map for client and counselor and this is certainly an analogy that works for me. For example you will see a moment in this session when my client and I seem to have lost our way a little. Egan skilled help a model and I'm talking about that model described in the later editions of his book here, provides us with useful way of understanding exactly what's going on. You remember he identifies three distinct stages to the work of client and counselor might do. The current scenario, the preferred scenario and the action strategies. 

00:04:40
Current Scenario The Story Blind Spots Leverage Preferred Scenario Possibilities Change Agenda Commitment Action Strategies Possible Strategies Best Fit The Plan action. 

00:04:40
MIKE SIMMONS In this session I'm working with a client who already has a very clear preferred scenario. But I think this will always have implications if the current scenario isn't also adequately explored. I think we see a drift in this session between stage 2, the preferred scenario and the action strategies of stage 3. You might want to consider whether this work is adequately grounded in an understanding of what the current scenario actually is. In Egan's terms do we really know what's going on? You may want to think about this, I'll certainly be mentioning it in the commentary. But perhaps that's enough about the tape, now it's time to have a look at it and to see what you think. As I've already said if this is really a piece of trait work I would be expecting you to be taking careful notes so that you could give the counselor useful feedback at the end of session. You won't be able to give me feedback of course, but I would still encourage you to be taking those notes. We've got half an hour, that's five past eleven now, where do you want to start? 

00:05:55
AMELIA LYONS Well as you know, I'm I think I'm on the point of wanting to give up smoking, well I do want to give up and you know I wanted to give up for a long time. And… and but then I feel scary, I feel scary to contemplate giving up smoking. 

00:06:20
MIKE SIMMONS So something you want to do… 

00:06:20
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:06:20
MIKE SIMMONS …but also something that was frightening. 

00:06:20
AMELIA LYONS Yeah definitely yeah, yeah yes. I've done it before. I did it the first time I gave up, I gave up for five years and I thought that was it and, and so on and so forth and I just sort of fell back into it, went abroad for a couple of days in Belgium. And you know everyone smoking and I just thought I'll just smoke while I'm here, well of course that was a killer for me because once I started then I was back. And then I had a couple of other weak attempts in my 30's to stop, I was going out with some blow(ph) to eventually decided you know he objected to the smoking. I mean while there was no ultimatum anyway a weekly sort of, but that was no good that didn't work. So it lasted a few months and then I had one more attempt and that was just before I became Head of Department not realizing I was you know gonna get the job and when I, I just went back to it. And within a few days so that it seems that each time I've tried to give up, actually it's been harder than it was the first time it was the easiest. And that since then it's, it's got harder so and I know how harder is anyway was hard the first time lonely other times. So I know I just know it's going to be harder now. I also think the other thing about is because I've been thinking about making up video and… and you know the sessions and stuff. And, and that it's like giving up a best friend you know and if I've had this picture of graves and then lots of things. So I know if I give up this time I really want to give up for ever I don't want to be going back and going back and going through it all over again. So it feels a really huge think to do. 

00:08:20
MIKE SIMMONS And it feels like there is quite a lot I'm conscious you are talking in terms of attempts. You've made an attempt then I made an attempt then… 

00:08:25
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:08:25
MIKE SIMMONS …and that this time it's got to be forever and that's really frightening a bit. 

00:08:35
AMELIA LYONS Yeah that's right, that is frightening a bit. 

00:08:40
MIKE SIMMONS I'm trying to get a sense of that, that frightening. 

00:08:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah 

00:08:40
MIKE SIMMONS Can you say bit more. 

00:08:45
AMELIA LYONS Well it is, I suppose it's a crunch you know it's something that a sort of it's like a friend that's is bad for you. I was thinking of it in that way. So I suppose you know you find just what I mean it's such a habit for me some such a heavy smoker as well. So it's not like I smoke when I'm stressed. I smoke any times so I think. And you know it's just, it's just sort of always there. You know and it is like, it is like a friend. And it feels scary to give up that friend even though I know that they are not doing me any good. 

00:09:30
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… I, I got a sense of you know when your parents talk about unsuitable friends. 

00:09:35
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:09:35
MIKE SIMMONS That is like this unsuitable friend but actually for you it's an unsuitable friend you've have been able to rely on them. 

00:09:40
AMELIA LYONS Yes, yes. 

00:09:40
MIKE SIMMONS And never mind the way it's unsuitable in the way it's killing you. 

00:09:45
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:09:45
MIKE SIMMONS It's still always there. 

00:09:50
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:09:50
MIKE SIMMONS And… 

00:09:50
AMELIA LYONS Yeah it is yeah… 

00:09:50
MIKE SIMMONS …that is on the table on the desk there is a packet of cigarette. 

00:09:55
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:09:55
MIKE SIMMONS And do not have that there. 

00:09:55
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:09:55
MIKE SIMMONS Then produces is great void(ph) I guess. 

00:10:00
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah, yeah it's, it's like to not have that there. It's like yeah I would miss it. And it's also what am I going to do with myself, with my hands and my mouth. And yeah, I mean I'm just thinking about before we, there as well. You know yes it is something that you can rely on it you know it's always there. And it doesn't feel anything else quite like that. 

00:10:35
MIKE SIMMONS That reliable. 

00:10:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah I mean obviously cigarette is still announce(ph) tobacco or whatever it is, but yes, yeah. 

00:10:45
MIKE SIMMONS So there are always there is a kind to comfort. 

00:10:50
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah. 

00:10:50
MARK SIMMONS And whole pattern of, of behaviors. 

00:10:55
AMELIA LYONS Yeah 

00:10:55
MIKE SIMMONS What am I going to do with my hands or what am I going to do. I'll pick up the phone and, and kind of they're not gonna light up that. 

00:11:00
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah, that's right and, and I suppose thinking of it like that, comfort you know it threw me back to a sort of the objects that I had as a child. So as always a child with an object you know, in my early years it was my father sock and then it moved on to a variety of teddies. And I only stopped having a teddy in my bed when I was sixteen then I have glandular fever. Now it's so hot and sweaty in bed that the teddy came out of the bed, you know and then since then it just you know I never sort of slept with the teddy again kind of thing. But I, I always had I suppose until a point, an object in, in some way I haven't thought of it like that actually. 

00:11:45
MIKE SIMMONS So there is a sock, there is the teddies and now this is unsuitable friend. 

00:11:50
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:11:50
MIKE SIMMONS And each of the previous ones have kind of gone. 

00:11:55
AMELIA LYONS Yes they naturally… 

00:11:55
MIKE SIMMONS Passed by. 

00:11:55
AMELIA LYONS Yeah 

00:11:55
MIKE SIMMONS And now, now you kind of confronted with this. 

00:11:55
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:12:00
MIKE SIMMONS This is one naturally going to… 

00:12:00
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:12:00
MIKE SIMMONS …pass by 

00:12:00
AMELIA LYONS And I do remember when I lost my teddy in Ireland one time when we're coming away from some hotel I left my teddy in there, distraught about this teddy. I guess I was about eight at that time you know. So we have to go back and because it wasn't there, anyway I, I had about three so you know sort of dealt with it but yeah you know the, the sort of thought of not being, not having the teddy he was quite an issue really. 

00:12:30
MIKE SIMMONS And, and this is like that only more so because there is always an another cigarette in a sense is not an unsuitable friend, there is a chain of some, queue of some… 

00:12:40
AMELIA LYONS Yes, yes and I suppose with the teddies too, like I never obviously sort of apart from holidays and things I may never sort of brought them to school or anything, you know it's only that first one, when I was four that, up to, up to the age of four where I carried that everywhere with me. You know until it's a sort of disintegrated really. Whereas after that I didn't have them all, it was only bed time, you know particular time you know. So you know it was like the whole time whereas the cigarettes is the whole time. 

00:13:10
MARK SIMMONS Whole time. 

00:13:10
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:13:10
MARK SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:13:15
AMELIA LYONS Apart from sleeping. 

00:13:15
MARK SIMMONS Yeah, first thing in the morning. 

00:13:15
AMELIA LYONS Oh yeah. 

00:13:15
MARK SIMMONS Lasting thing at night. 

00:13:20
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:13:20
MARK SIMMONS That feels like that is going to be quite oblique void. 

00:13:25
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:13:25
MIKE SIMMONS Quite a loss. 

00:13:25
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah it is going to be a loss. Umm… 

00:13:35
MARK SIMMONS Umm… kind of you're smiling… 

00:13:40
AMELIA LYONS It's nerves that you see. It's nerves that the full fear, you know fear can either make me angry or provoke nervous smiling and laughter. And, and in this case you know it's, it's, it's the latter because although of stopping this just oh my god you know. 

00:14:00
MIKE SIMMONS Umm… I'm kind of conscious in a way of how, how we come to be doing this making this video. 

00:14:05
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:14:05
MIKE SIMMONS And we can talk about being the useful thing to work with students what we've made of. 

00:14:15
AMELIA LYONS Yeah sure. 

00:14:15
MIKE SIMMONS Perhaps you've brought something… 

00:14:15
AMELIA LYONS Yeah 

00:14:15
MIKE SIMMONS …that is so real. 

00:14:20
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:14:20
MIKE SIMMONS And also so scary so maybe that's the only way you can do it. Kind of almost bringing in sideways, kind of bringing in the idea of it, as an, as an issue to talk about. 

00:14:30
AMELIA LYONS Right 

00:14:35
MIKE SIMMONS And you're actually talking about it. 

00:14:35
AMELIA LYONS Umm… 

00:14:35
MIKE SIMMONS Great quite a lot of anxiety and it's kind of very real and it's like your kind of how it feels like you're hovering on the edge of touching that, that loss. 

00:14:45
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:14:45
MIKE SIMMONS Its a kind of thing… 

00:14:45
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah I think, I think I was thinking last year about you know I'm going to stop and I was thinking last year I am going to stop this year and now I am going to stop and I didn't. But I knew I feel like I having closer to it, but I feel like I can't do it cold Turkey this time. So I was thinking to myself I suppose even before the group suggested some videos or some demos that I must think about a number of strategies to give it up you know like I'll have to get the patches whereas before I've never done that. Maybe how a couple of counseling sessions now having occurred(ph) to me to do with the team it was the only one choice when the group suggested and I was thinking about them that, that sort of I thought well there is no reason why not if. Some of the team willing, and, and sort of trying to get a number of things that attacking in all directions really rather than before which was just you know completely cold Turkey, pure will power and that was it. You know although I had to things from my hands like knitting you know things were terrible. I just knitted for the sake of it you know in the evenings rather than having this hands that would want a cigarettes you know. 

00:16:10
AMELIA LYONS It feels a bit like the times when you given up before there was other attempts. 

00:16:15
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:16:15
MIKE SIMMONS You know you've kind of managed that and you saying each time it's harder to do it. 

00:16:20
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:16:20
MIKE SIMMONS And at this time you've really got not to marshal every strategy, every thing… 

00:16:25
AMELIA LYONS Yeah 

00:16:25
MIKE SIMMONS Every, everything… 

00:16:25
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:16:25
MIKE SIMMONS …nothing, nothing to, to get in the way of your succeeding and everything to help you succeed. 

00:16:35
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah 

00:16:35
MIKE SIMMONS I got there is sense or so of(ph) now or never. I've got to do it at this time. 

00:16:45
AMELIA LYONS Well yeah I suppose I sort of feel like if I don't really do it before I'm faulty then I probably would be more in danger of getting cancer. And you know that I want to know that I'm sort of moving towards that, two years away. But I need to kind of prepare really for the second half of my life and part of that will have to include more looking of to myself and not being as abusive with my body as I have been through smoking or whatever it is. Because I know that you know as I hit that side I mean you know may be the health where lost and you know. so, so I've got to, to do some thing more active or where I always in the past. I have been to be able to rely on the good health. 

00:17:40
MIKE SIMMONS So the fear of cancer. 

00:17:45
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:17:45
MIKE SIMMONS It appears I guess you also fear of death, this might kill me? 

00:17:50
AMELIA LYONS I think it's the fear of getting I don't fear. I've never felt like I feared death really. But it is not so much liked the way of dying. And so yeah you know right getting a horrible cancer, you know there are certain cancers you, you know I would feel like I would mind. I'm sure nobody like any cancer that you know there if I am to see. So for example, I wouldn't have throat cancer or you know esophageal cancer or though sorts of ones that, I afraid bloody nasty and not only that. But you know you can't eat properly or speak properly, you know following that sort of thing. So that kind of stuff, sort of thing who will know, you know you've got, you know umm… umm. 

00:18:35
MIKE SIMMONS You have done a lot of thinking about that… 

00:18:35
AMELIA LYONS Oh yeah. 

00:18:40
MIKE SIMMONS …really you've got the stuff. 

00:18:40
AMELIA LYONS You do as a smoker as well, you do yeah. I mean I think every, every smoker does, does think about that. 

00:18:45
AMELIA LYONS Alright this sounds me a kind of like a dodgy advertising campaign I've got this all thought of rushing relay, you know would have been this oh god or would it be that to me. 

00:19:00
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:19:00
MIKE SIMMONS or wouldn't mind that so much that would be awful… 

00:19:00
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah that's right actually, there is, there is that sort of and it's funny really because I am not sort of jump out of airplanes, parachuting or anything like that, that you know disruptive sports or something. You know all those dangerous sports, don't hold a special attraction for me. You know I don't, I don't feel, you know feel like I want to sort of do that. But there is, there is a rushing relay term… 

00:19:30
MIKE SIMMONS Alright, so risking your life, in itself does not feel like an attraction. 

00:19:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:19:40
MIKE SIMMONS Don't want it to do that and yet you do something on the day-to-day basis. 

00:19:45
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:19:45
MIKE SIMMONS But I guess is constantly stacking the odds. 

00:19:50
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yes, yes it is, but you see it's, it's, it's, it's hard to, it's hard to you know I know how hard it is to. It will, it will be very difficult in first few weeks. 

00:20:15
MIKE SIMMONS Sure, I was kind of wondering what you are going to say when you say it's hard to, it's hard to. I wasn't sure whether it was hard to imagine, hard to imagine getting a cancer like that. Hard to imagine that smoking could be connected to that, you are jumping out of an airplane we understand. 

00:20:35
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:20:35
MIKE SIMMONS That's you know very obvious kind of… 

00:20:35
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:20:40
MIKE SIMMONS …frightening risky kind of thing. 

00:20:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:20:40
MIKE SIMMONS And I am not clear how much you are connected to the reality of kind of cause and effect with cigarettes. 

00:20:50
AMELIA LYONS Would you see to an, to an extent I think well I was going to say it was hard too much in giving up smoking even though I'm really want to, right. But in, in relation to what you put I think I've lost the question. 

00:21:10
MIKE SIMMONS I was just wondering about how much you made that direct connection between. 

00:21:15
AMELIA LYONS Oh yes, well as a smoker what I sort of do and I was going to speak in the way again because you know knowing few friends who are heavy smokers, but what I do is block you, you, you've to in order to continue smoking anyway to block out some of those messages to certain degree or put them. Well it's, it's like to put them in a little box you put later on in your mind somewhere. So you just it's likely the rubbish post that you get. You know, you, you pile them up somewhere and then eventually you have been in the sort of thing. And so, so you try… you say you don't open in the first place. You don't open the envelope you just put it to the side and hope it goes, it goes away you know. 

00:22:05
MIKE SIMMONS I've seen from the last year of college you had a no smoking day and this maybe a year or two before that. 

00:22:10
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:22:10
MIKE SIMMONS A kind of wonder what happened then was that sort of one of those things that's kind of not me. 

00:22:15
AMELIA LYONS Oh yeah definitely, oh yeah, I mean what you know is a, you know you've got to give up when you are absolutely totally determined a no smoking day wouldn't do me any good. 

00:22:25
MIKE SIMMONS So like I showed kind of thing with the… 

00:22:25
AMELIA LYONS Part time smokers yeah, part time smokers could probably manage that but not, not a proper smoker. 

00:22:35
MIKE SIMMONS Kind of professional. 

00:22:35
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah. 

00:22:35
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:22:35
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah if you only smoke a couple of packs a day, your minds this will carry on. Unfortunately, I'm not one of those people, who shall was… 

00:22:55
MIKE SIMMONS There was a kind of anxious smile. 

00:22:55
AMELIA LYONS Umm… yeah. 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:20
AMELIA LYONS It's the thought, I suppose the thought of you know in the evenings particularly because I can imagine at work okay it will be hard. Umm… but in the evening getting home particularly to you know that's, that's a nice thing to sort of look forward doing one sense of this smoke all the time, but you know sit down with a cup of tea or a drink and a cigarette, you know that's the thing you do when you are relax. And the thought of that not being that is going to be hard. 

00:23:55
MIKE SIMMONS It's like you associate with everything, it feels like. 

00:24:00
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah I do yeah. 

00:24:00
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, cup of coffee, cigarette, telephone cigarette, meeting, finishing a meeting. 

00:24:10
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:24:10
MIKE SIMMONS In a way kind of punctuates your day. 

00:24:15
AMELIA LYONS Yes, it does, it does it does exactly that. It does exactly that. I mean I suppose I can draw on the time when I first gave up umm… where all I just punctuate everything. But some reason I think with work you kind of more distracted anyways, so you have got things to do and you have to get on with them. So you can sort of get through it a bit. When you go home and there is like you know a sort of a space that's when I know. The first thing in the morning and the evenings is gonna be the worst time for me. 

00:25:00
MIKE SIMMONS Right, so you're kind of clear about whether, whether I guess where the dangers are. 

00:25:05
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:25:05
MIKE SIMMONS If it is something you want to do. 

00:25:05
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:25:10
MIKE SIMMONS Then starting smoking again will be a kind failing at it. I'm not sure you're, you're most vulnerable at those points of the day. 

00:25:15
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah, yeah I mean I'm thinking what I'm, what I probably should do to… to correct the evening a bit I use to get… before I did knitting and I just knitted, you know scarf after scarf because that's the only thing I can knit and I'm not… not very dexterous or anything. But I knew that it would help make because it was something stood in my hands. Whereas now I think maybe I should go and get one of those old tapestry things, just to keep my hands going, something very simple. Because I don't care what the outcome of the thing is as long as it keeps my hands occupied for few weeks, it probably a few months really. Because even first time, you know I have to knit, all the time for about six months before I finally could let that be go. 

00:26:05
MIKE SIMMONS I got this picture of you, at home… 

00:26:10
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:26:10
MIKE SIMMONS Doing something to occupy yourself. 

00:26:10
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:26:15
MIKE SIMMONS And closing your ears to the unsuitable friend that's knocking the door, phoning you up. 

00:26:20
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:26:20
MIKE SIMMONS Saying why not. 

00:26:20
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:26:25
MIKE SIMMONS And like you're under siege all the time. 

00:26:25
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah. 

00:26:30
MIKE SIMMONS And then working to kind of developed strategies that would keep that friend obey. 

00:26:35
AMELIA LYONS That's right and break the associations. 

00:26:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, so I can. 

00:26:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:26:40
MIKE SIMMONS I can drink coffee without smoking. 

00:26:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah, I mean some of those as you just got you know by just sort of doing it and changing the carrying on doing exactly the same but not smoking. You do begin to break the associations anyway. And I know that from the past but the… the… yeah. There are certain times when it's much harder much harder. And I've got to be prepared for those times otherwise you know, I'll make a mess of them. 

00:27:15
MIKE SIMMONS Make a mess. 

00:27:15
AMELIA LYONS Well I'll go back you know, you know listen very careful. 

00:27:20
MIKE SIMMONS What that mean? going back? 

00:27:25
AMELIA LYONS Well going back would be, it would be like a weak attempt. And, and I did you know this time I know that when I do I want to do it for good. I don't wanna be messing about with weak attempt. It's gotta be proper fully fledged, full frontal attack. 

00:27:45
MIKE SIMMONS Alright, but I am still not clear if you failed. 

00:27:50
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:27:50
MIKE SIMMONS What is that saying. 

00:27:50
AMELIA LYONS Well it's not the end of the world, but it might say that got a profile again you know am I really ever gonna to stop smoking. 

00:28:00
MIKE SIMMONS Right, so that's a be it back to. 

00:28:05
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:28:05
MIKE SIMMONS This could be my last chance here. 

00:28:05
AMELIA LYONS Yeah there is, I suppose, I suppose that's right yeah. 

00:28:10
MIKE SIMMONS So it makes it more important. 

00:28:15
AMELIA LYONS Yeah it does, yeah. Yeah. 

00:28:15
MIKE SIMMONS We have got about five more minutes. 

00:28:20
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:28:20
MIKE SIMMONS So it's more important than every big problem. 

00:28:25
AMELIA LYONS Yeah it is, it is more important. 

00:28:30
[sil.] 

00:28:35
AMELIA LYONS I know, I gotten the giggles. 

00:28:40
[sil.] 

00:28:45
MIKE SIMMONS I'm kind of get sense of, go on then, make me, yeah make me, make it, make it right. You, you do it give me a cure. 

00:29:00
AMELIA LYONS Wish you could… 

00:29:00
MIKE SIMMONS Say this thing will… 

00:29:00
AMELIA LYONS Yeah it took me over. 

00:29:00
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:29:05
[sil.] 

00:29:05
AMELIA LYONS Yeah well I think you know, we're are struggling with uncertainty what I am is, is you know that it is. You know a kind of stuckness and ambivalence really about it. You know and probably you know apart that might be the unsuitable friend coming up and then make me a day you'll something like that. And I may hadn't thought of it in that way particularly but that could be part of that I think. And you know I don't want that sort of thing. 

00:29:45
MIKE SIMMONS Don't want to… 

00:29:45
AMELIA LYONS Don't want to well a friend of mine has a saying with these, say I don't want to you know what to say? I don't have to, I don't want to when I ain't gonna. 

00:29:55
MIKE SIMMONS And is that give up? 

00:30:00
AMELIA LYONS Uh… that's, that sort of I'm not gonna do what you tell me to do sort of thing. 

00:30:00
MIKE SIMMONS Alright. 

00:30:05
AMELIA LYONS And um, it's a… it's a sort of values the expression that um… and you know just sort of that, I think that's the… the you know the two sort of polarities there, you know one part is you fucking gonna do this? And then part is I don't want to. 

00:30:25
MIKE SIMMONS So that's kind of more an insight. 

00:30:25
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, I think so. 

00:30:25
MIKE SIMMONS But… but I got bit of a sense is well of uh… you're saying to me kind of go on and leave me. 

00:30:35
AMELIA LYONS Right. 

00:30:35
MIKE SIMMONS Uh… and… and kind of pushing the responsibility on to me… 

00:30:40
AMELIA LYONS Right. 

00:30:40
MIKE SIMMONS So… so sort of then you want me to push a… 

00:30:40
AMELIA LYONS Right. 

00:30:40
MIKE SIMMONS …and you… and you can resist. 

00:30:45
AMELIA LYONS Right, right. That wasn't a conscious thing… 

00:30:50
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:30:50
AMELIA LYONS Because I do know, I think the struggle is… I know it's all on me and I've got to do it you know nobody really can help me, I mean we can do it through this and to do that um… so yes, I can try and help the… the forces marshal the resources. But it's really its down to me at the end of the day and that's, I mean I wish that, I wish it was down to someone else, you know is only and I've got to do it. 

00:31:15
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… 

00:31:15
AMELIA LYONS And that's ah… you know that's bloody hard. 

00:31:20
MIKE SIMMONS To do a like, You've… 

00:31:25
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, it is. 

00:31:25
MIKE SIMMONS …got to do it alone… 

00:31:25
AMELIA LYONS It is. 

00:31:25
MIKE SIMMONS …by definition… 

00:31:25
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:31:30
MIKE SIMMONS …and that also makes it harder. 

00:31:30
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:31:30
MIKE SIMMONS Uh… uh… I guess the paradox is that it's the kind of thing that a cigarette would help you through the difficult… 

00:31:40
AMELIA LYONS Umm… umm… umm… 

00:31:40
MIKE SIMMONS …time to be easier. 

00:31:45
AMELIA LYONS Umm… um… Yeah. 

00:31:50
MIKE SIMMONS And we are… 

00:31:50
AMELIA LYONS Umm… 

00:31:50
MIKE SIMMONS …running out of time now… 

00:31:50
AMELIA LYONS Umm… 

00:31:50
MIKE SIMMONS …just conscious of that unsuitable friend and pushing… pushing that friend away and… 

00:32:00
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:32:00
MIKE SIMMONS …the difficulty of… of staying centered in you and what he want from him. 

00:32:05
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. Yeah, I mean those… there's nothing to be done about it really, it's um… you know it's barren landscape and it was gonna be hard. 

00:32:25
MIKE SIMMONS If you wanna do this again, maybe that landscape might be somewhere you want to go. 

00:32:30
AMELIA LYONS Umm… 

00:32:30
MIKE SIMMONS I don't know, but we've run out of time now. 

00:32:35
AMELIA LYONS Okay. Thank you, Mike. 

00:32:35
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. That's the end of the session. We'll go right back to the beginning now and watch it with a commentary. We've got half an hour it's five passed eleven now where do you want start. And straight away there's something that seems were same, there was no real form of contract there that it need to be one because we already discussed the session beforehand, we knew what we were going to do, we knew we're going to run the session, we knew we were doing with this tape. So that only seem necessary for me to actually say what needed to be said, how long we've got. 

00:33:15
AMELIA LYONS Well as you know um… I think I'm on the point uh… of wanting to give up smoking, well I do want to give up and you know I wanted to give up for a long time. And… and uh… but I feel scary, I feel scary to contemplate giving up smoking. 

00:33:35
MIKE SIMMONS So something you want to do… 

00:33:35
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:33:35
MIKE SIMMONS …but also something that was frightening. 

00:33:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Yes, um… 

00:33:45
[sil.] 

00:33:50
AMELIA LYONS I've done it before, I did it the… the first time I gave up, I gave up for five years. And I thought that was it and… and so on and so forth. And I just sort of fell back into it, went abroad for a couple of days uh… in Belgium and you know everyone was smoking and I just thought oh, I'll just smoke while I'm here, well of course, that was a killer for me because once I started then I was back. And then I had a couple of other weak attempts in my 30s to stop and it's going out with some blow to eventually decided you know he objected to the smoking and you know, well there was no ultimatum and anyway a… a weekly sort of, but that was no good, that didn't work. So that lasted a few months, and then I had a one more attempt and that was just before I became Head of Department not realizing I was you know gonna get the job and when I… I just went back to it. And within a few days, so that it seems that each time I've tried to give up, actually it's been harder then it was the first time was the easiest, and that since then, it's… it's got harder. So and I know how harder is anyway, it was hard for the first time and low… low in the other times. So I know, I just know it's gonna be harder, not… I also think the other thing about it is because I've been thinking about making up video and… and you know the sessions and stuff and… and that it's like giving out the best friend, you know when I've got this picture of graves and all that something. So, I know if I give up this time, I really wanna give up forever I don't wanna be going back and going through it all over again. So, it feels a really huge thing to do. 

00:35:35
MIKE SIMMONS And it feels like there is quite a lot I'm conscious you're talking in terms of attempts, you've made… 

00:35:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:35:40
MIKE SIMMONS …then made an attempt and made an attempt and… 

00:35:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:35:45
MIKE SIMMONS …and that this time it's got to be forever. 

00:35:45
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:35:50
MIKE SIMMONS And that's really frightening that. 

00:35:50
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, I felt that uh… that… that bid was good and the attempts was… was good; the focus on the word attempts and the acknowledgement both at the start of the session and now with the fear that was involved and uh… I appreciated that and I was appreciated um… being listened to um… uh… being able to say my story and having to go through that without being interrupted. And yet, the salient points there were… were picked out so that, that was good I felt good. 

00:36:25
MIKE SIMMONS It just seemed important to be listening at this point. One thing you might want to think about is how comfortable do I look, I don't know whether I don't look at the wooden at start of this session. Ah… so you think. 

00:36:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. That's right. My eyes are frightening a bit. 

00:36:45
MIKE SIMMONS I try and get sense of that, that frightening… 

00:36:45
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:36:45
MIKE SIMMONS …can you say a bit more? 

00:36:50
AMELIA LYONS Well, it's um… I suppose it's a crutch you know, it's something that a sort of… it's like a friend that spared for you, I was thinking that in that way. So, I suppose you know you find just well, I mean it's such a habit for me, some such a heavy smoker as well. So it's not like I smoke when I'm stressed, I smoke any time sort of thing. And uh… you know it's just… it's just sort of always there, you know and it is like… it is a like a friend. And um… it feel scary to give up that friend, even though I know that they're not doing me any good. 

00:37:35
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… I… I got a sense of you know when your parents talk about unsuitable friends. 

00:37:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:37:40
MIKE SIMMONS The… those unsuitable friend, but actually if you… it… it's an unsuitable friend you've been able to rely on them. 

00:37:45
AMELIA LYONS Yes, yes, yes. 

00:37:45
MIKE SIMMONS And never mind a way that is unsuitable and the way it's killing you… 

00:37:50
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:37:50
MIKE SIMMONS …it's still always there. 

00:37:55
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:37:55
MIKE SIMMONS And, yeah. 

00:37:55
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, it is there. 

00:37:55
MIKE SIMMONS That is on the table, on the desk, there's a packet of cigarette. 

00:38:00
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:38:00
MIKE SIMMONS And to not have that there… 

00:38:00
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:38:00
MIKE SIMMONS …then it produces is great void(ph) I guess. 

00:38:05
AMELIA LYONS What I felt there was… that was a good uh… response to me, the friend that was bad for me and although, it was that keen on the objective unsuitable that the picking up over the metaphor and running with it was good. But one day when I felt uncomfortable with that was when he, Mike was obviously challenging me and saying you know like it's killing you and that, that kind of stuff and I know that's out of a… a sort of a caring thing for me. And I that… I don't know how much he would have said that, if I haven't been a colleague that he knows and you know was been interested in helping me to stop. But I felt that that's when he was a bit disapproving and I know it's… it's a tricky… it's a tricky area of that approval and disapproval, but it's… it's kind of central to smoking really in some ways and so, I suppose the counselor has to balance the challenge there with not being uh… disapproving and so… so it felt like that was slightly colored that he did disapprove, even though I knew that underneath that um… that was just a sort of superficial thing really. 

00:39:15
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, there were two things there that I was unhappy about watching the tape for second time. First thing was that killing you, it felt too risky, too challenging ah… I think should've stuck with me as a… horning me that would have been enough. The other thing, the unsuitable friend felt like a lovely image to me. You'll see it comes up again, I kind of like the idea of it, but I think I tried to sell it to my client, it didn't quite fit and I didn't notice it not flitching and so I came to watch the tape afterwards. So that kind of image can be very, very helpful, if the counselor and client can relate to it. If only the counselors relating to it, it's not lot of help. 

00:40:05
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's… it's like to not have that there is like ah… yeah I would miss it and it's also what am I gonna do with myself, um… with my hands and my mouth uh… and yeah, I mean I'm just thinking about the value(ph) there as well, you know. Yes, it is something that you can rely on it and it's always there and it doesn't feel anything else quite like that. 

00:40:40
MIKE SIMMONS Right. That reliable? 

00:40:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. Yeah, I mean obviously cigarettes don't answer you back or whatever it is, but yes, yeah. 

00:40:50
MIKE SIMMONS So there… always there is a kind of comfort? 

00:40:50
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah. 

00:40:55
MIKE SIMMONS …and whole pattern of… of behaviors… 

00:41:00
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:41:00
MIKE SIMMONS …and what am I gonna do with my hands or what you do… 

00:41:00
AMELIA LYONS Yeah and I… 

00:41:00
MIKE SIMMONS …pick up the phone and… and, and kind of they're not gonna light up that. 

00:41:05
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah. That's right. What I found useful there was… was both the… the comfort, the notion of the comfort and also of this um… ongoing uh… reliability theme. I found both of those things helpful and insightful. 

00:41:25
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. If we talk about uh… trying to enter the world of the client as if it was our own, I guess it's what… what I was trying to do. And for me, as a nonsmoker I had to work quite hard to get a sense of… of what giving up meant… I didn't mean giving up banging yourself on a head… on the head with a mallet, it was actually about loss and I had to work on my way into experiencing that into sensing that's what it was like for my clients. 

00:41:55
AMELIA LYONS And… and I suppose thinking of it like that comfort you know, it drew me back to um… a sort of the objects that I had as a child as… as always a child with an object you know, my early years, it was my father's sock and then it moved on to a variety of teddies. And I only stopped having a teddy in my bed when I was 16 and glandular fever and I was so hot and sweaty in bed that the teddy came out bed you know and um… since then it just, you know I never sort of slept with the teddy again kind of thing. But I… I have always had I suppose until that point um… an object in… in some way, I hadn't thought of it like that actually. The transitional object, the object thing that was a real piece of insight for me the fact that it was that the smoking was very similar to how I treated other objects in my past and that was a new… new piece of information for me, so… so that was very interesting. 

00:42:55
MIKE SIMMONS So there's a sock… 

00:42:55
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:42:55
MIKE SIMMONS …there is the teddies… 

00:42:55
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:42:55
MIKE SIMMONS And now this as unsuitable friend and it was the previous ones of kind of gone… 

00:43:00
AMELIA LYONS Yes, they naturally… 

00:43:05
MIKE SIMMONS …passed by. 

00:43:05
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:43:05
MIKE SIMMONS …and now that now you're kind of confronted with this… 

00:43:05
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:43:05
MIKE SIMMONS …this is one that naturally going to… 

00:43:10
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:43:10
MIKE SIMMONS …pass by. 

00:43:10
AMELIA LYONS And I do remember when I lost my teddy in Ireland uh… one time we were coming away from some hotel I left my teddy in there, distraught about this teddy. I guess I was about eight at the time, you know, so we have to go back and of course it wasn't there and… anywhere. I've… I've had about three so you know I sort of dealt with it. But uh… yeah, you know the… the sort of thought of not being, not having the teddy it was a quite an issue really. 

00:43:40
MIKE SIMMONS And… and this is like that only more so because… 

00:43:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:43:40
MIKE SIMMONS …there's always another cigarette in a sense, it's not an unsuitable friend. 

00:43:45
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:43:45
MIKE SIMMONS Does a chain of some a queue of some… 

00:43:50
AMELIA LYONS What I found useful about that was um… a bit of reality testing really and in that… the smoking of cigarettes is not to teddy, even though you know it probably feels like one or felt like one and um… the chain, I think the… just the chain of the… the unsuitable friends was… was a quite good reality checking. It was keeping me in touch with… with the element of reality about what smoking was about. I find that helpful. 

00:44:20
MIKE SIMMONS So see, here am I again, hoping on about the young suitable friend. The friend bit was right, the unsuitable isn't quite right for this client. He might want to think about what else I could have said that would have made her relate to what I was saying rather than it being I don't know, just a slight mismatch, maybe a slight irritant, certainly not helpful, I believe. 

00:44:45
AMELIA LYONS Yes, yes. And I suppose with the teddies to like I never obviously sort of apart from holidays and things like, I mean if I've sort of brought them to school or anything you know it was only that first one when I was four at the… up to a… up to the age of four where I carried to everywhere with me you know until it umm… sort of disintegrated really. Whereas, after that, I didn't have them all, it was only bedtime or… 

00:45:10
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… 

00:45:10
AMELIA LYONS …in particular time. So, you know it wasn't like the whole time whereas the cigarette is the whole time. 

00:45:15
MIKE SIMMONS Whole time? 

00:45:20
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:45:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:45:20
AMELIA LYONS Apart from sleeping. 

00:45:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. First thing in the morning? 

00:45:20
AMELIA LYONS Oh, yeah. 

00:45:25
MIKE SIMMONS Last thing at night. 

00:45:25
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:45:25
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… that feels like that's gonna be quite oblique void. 

00:45:30
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:45:30
MIKE SIMMONS …quite a loss. 

00:45:30
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. Yeah, it's just gonna be a loss. 

00:45:35
MIKE SIMMONS I think at this point, I did get a sense of just what the client would be giving up and showed and I got the sense of that. And I… in some way, giving up smoking feels like well that's an obvious, natural thing anyone would want to do that, though there it's maybe an addiction, but anyone would want to get rid of that addiction. At that point, I got a sense of what it was like, yeah, we're talking about loss here, way of loss. 

00:46:10
AMELIA LYONS Hmm… 

00:46:15
MIKE SIMMONS Um… kind of you're smiling. 

00:46:15
AMELIA LYONS Umm… its nerves that you see. It's nerves that the full fear, you know fear can either make me angry or provoke nervous smiling and laughter. And… and in this case, you know it's… it's… it's the latter because I thought of stopping this, it's just oh, my god you know. That was good, you know because I do smile when I'm frightened and so very good to… to notice that straight away straight in that. Very good. 

00:46:45
MIKE SIMMONS Because we don't know who's actually watching this tape uh… the answer might be pretty obvious to you, but you might want to think about what skill was that when I referred to Amelia smiling. I'm kind of conscious in a way of how uh… how we come to be doing this, making this really a… 

00:47:05
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:47:05
MIKE SIMMONS …uh… and we can talk about you know being a useful thing to work with… with students… 

00:47:15
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:47:15
MIKE SIMMONS When we have made a… 

00:47:15
AMELIA LYONS Sure. 

00:47:15
MIKE SIMMONS But actually you've brought something… 

00:47:15
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:47:20
MIKE SIMMONS …that is so real… 

00:47:20
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:47:20
MIKE SIMMONS …and also so scary that maybe that's the only way you can do it kind of you must bring it in sideways, kind of bringing in the idea of it as a… as an issue to talk about. 

00:47:35
AMELIA LYONS Right. 

00:47:35
MIKE SIMMONS And you're actually talking about it… 

00:47:35
AMELIA LYONS Umm… 

00:47:35
MIKE SIMMONS …great quite a lot of anxiety and it's kind of very real and it's like you kind of… it feels like you are hovering on the edge of touching that, that loss… 

00:47:45
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:47:45
MIKE SIMMONS …does that kind of make sense? 

00:47:45
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. I didn't quite understand what Mike was getting up, but I think he was saying several things, so I think he just needed to say one of them and I would have understood it more because it's where it's since I've watched the video now couple of times after it. I do understand the variety of aspects of things that he was getting out, but at that point the acknowledgment of the video and quite we were doing and what my intensions were and motivations were. And uh… perhaps I wasn't fully aware of myself at that point. 

00:48:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, I was struggling to express something that was only half formed in my mind at that time. I think if I was to say again, I… I would certainly refer to the fact that we were making a video, but I probably stopped by saying and yet, this is real and that meant to be an enough. 

00:48:40
AMELIA LYONS What Mike could have simply asked me was well what… what… what's this about making this video and… and… and I could have explored that and I think that would have been quite an interesting thing uh… to have done. Although, we were both quite fixated I think on the purpose of me making all the presenting purpose, which was of course, to give up the smoking. And… and… and that would have taken me off, so there are pros and cons to that intervention, but as we were acknowledging it, I think we could have… we could have looked at that amongst other things. 

00:49:15
MIKE SIMMONS And of course the interesting thing there was, if the purpose of making the video was simply for Amelia to stop smoking. Why we are making a video, why won't we just having a session. So there was an avert and a covert motive, I think that's where I was struggling towards that didn't quite reach and maybe we are actually reaching the point of understanding now in front of this camera that we didn't then. 

00:49:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. I think… I think I was thinking last year about you know I'm gonna stop and I was thinking last year I'm gonna stop this year now I'm gonna stop and I didn't, but I knew I feel like I've been getting closer to it, but I feel like I can't do a cold-turkey this time. So, I was thinking to myself I suppose even before the group suggested some videos or some demos that, I must think about a number of strategies to give it up you know, like I will have to get the patches whereas before I have never done that, maybe on a couple of counseling sessions you know, it hadn't occurred to me to do that with the team it was only one towards when the group suggested and I was thinking about them that that sort of I thought well, there is no reason why not if some of the team are welling. 

00:50:30
MIKE SIMMONS You have just noticed Amelia has referred to the team probably a bit confusing, all it is, is she made a series of videos with different members of the counseling team. This is one of them. 

00:50:45
AMELIA LYONS Uh… and… and sort of trying to get a number of things that attach, attacking in all directions really rather than before which was just you know, completely cold-turkey pure will power and that was it, you know although I had to the things from my hands like knitting you know and things I'm a terrible knitter. I just knitted for the sake of it you know, in the evenings. 

00:51:05
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… 

00:51:10
AMELIA LYONS Rather than having these hands that would want a cigarette, you know. 

00:51:15
MIKE SIMMONS It feels a bit like the times when you have given up before those other attempts… 

00:51:20
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:51:20
MIKE SIMMONS …the you've kind of managed here and you're saying each time it's harder to do it. 

00:51:25
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:51:25
MIKE SIMMONS And understand you really got to marshal… 

00:51:30
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:51:30
MIKE SIMMONS …every strategy. 

00:51:30
AMELIA LYONS Yeah 

00:51:30
MIKE SIMMONS Every, everything. 

00:51:30
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:51:35
MIKE SIMMONS Nothing to get in the way of your succeeding. 

00:51:35
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:51:35
MIKE SIMMONS And everything to help you succeed. 

00:51:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah. 

00:51:40
MIKE SIMMONS I got a bit of sense of now or never. I have got to do it this time. 

00:51:50
AMELIA LYONS Well, yeah I suppose… I was sort of feel like if I don't really do it before I'm faulty then I probably would be more in danger of, of getting cancer and you know that I ought to now that I'm sort of moving towards that ah… two years away that I need to kind of prepare really for the second half of my life and part of that will have to include more looking after myself and not being ah… as abusive with my body as I have being through smoking or whatever it is. Ah, because I know that you know, as I hit that side I mean, you know maybe the health won't lost and you know so, so I have got to, to do something more active whereas always in the past I have been able to rely on good health. 

00:52:45
MIKE SIMMONS So the fear of cancer… 

00:52:50
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:52:50
MIKE SIMMONS …is I guess also a fear of death, this might kill me. 

00:52:55
AMELIA LYONS I think it's the fear of getting… I don't fear, I never felt like I feared death really, but it's not so much lights(ph) the way of dying and so yeah, you know like getting a horrible cancer you know like there are certain cancers you, you know I sort of feel like I wouldn't mind, I'm sure nobody would like any cancer, but you know there are fantasies so for example, I wouldn't want to have throat cancer or you know or esophageal cancer are those sorts of ones that pretty bloody and nasty and not only that, but you know you can't eat properly or speak properly you know following that sort of thing, so and that kind of stuff I sort of think oh no, you know, you got to you know… hmm… hmm… 

00:53:40
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, seeing that box opening hearing about the different kinds of cancer was, was a real eye opener for me, you know feeling my way into a close world, that was a real surprise I didn't have a sense of that before. The other thing that it brings to my mind, I, I spoke earlier about when I refer to and it's killing you. Well, we can see here I didn't need to take that risk then, we were moving in that direction later on. And you've done a lot of thinking about it… 

00:54:15
AMELIA LYONS Oh, yeah. 

00:54:15
MIKE SIMMONS …I mean if you have got the stuff. 

00:54:15
AMELIA LYONS …you do as a smoker as well, you do, yeah I mean I think every, every smoker does, does think about that. 

00:54:25
MIKE SIMMONS It sounds a bit kind of like the dodgy advertising campaign, I've got this self sort of rushing relay you know, would it be this oh god or would it be that thing. 

00:54:35
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:54:35
MIKE SIMMONS I wouldn't mind that so much that be awful. 

00:54:35
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah that's right actually that there is, there is such sort of… 

00:54:40
MIKE SIMMONS I thought that rushing relay thing was incredibly hackneyed, I was desperately trying to think of a different image, yet it seem to fit. Ah… and it felt like that having that image worked well for the client, she could relate to it, ah… but I wouldn't know if trying to think as something else to say at that moment. 

00:55:00
AMELIA LYONS And it's funny really because I have not a sort to jump out of airplanes, parachuting or anything like that that you know destructive sports or something you know, all those dangerous sports don't hold and a special attraction for me, you know I don't, I don't feel, you know feel like I want to sort of do that but there is, there is that rushing relay term yeah. 

00:55:25
MIKE SIMMONS So risking your life in itself doesn't feel like an attraction. 

00:55:30
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:55:30
MIKE SIMMONS You don't want to do that. 

00:55:30
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:55:35
MIKE SIMMONS And yet you do something on the day to day basis. 

00:55:35
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:55:35
MIKE SIMMONS That I guess is constantly stacking the odds. 

00:55:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yes, yes it is but, you see it, it's… it's some it's… it's hard to, it's hard to you know, I know how hard it is to, it will, it will be very difficult in the first few weeks. 

00:56:05
MIKE SIMMONS Sure. I was kind of wondering what you were gonna say when you said it's hard to… it's hard to I, I wasn't sure that it was hard to imagine, hard to imagine getting a cancer like that, hard to imagine that smoking could be connected to that, you are jumping out of an airplane we understand… 

00:56:25
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:56:30
MIKE SIMMONS …that's you know a very obvious kind of… 

00:56:30
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:56:30
MIKE SIMMONS …frightening risky kind of thing. 

00:56:35
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:56:35
MIKE SIMMONS And I'm, I'm not clear how much you are connected to the reality of kind of cause and effect with cigarettes. 

00:56:45
AMELIA LYONS Would you see to an, to an extent I think what I was gonna say was it's hard to imagine giving up smoking even though I really want to, right? But in, in relation to what you put I think, oh I lost the question. 

00:57:00
MIKE SIMMONS I was just wondering about how much you made that direct connection between… 

00:57:05
AMELIA LYONS Oh, yes well as a smoker, what I sort of do ah… and I was gonna speak in the way again, because you know knowing the few friends who are heavy smokers, but what I do is block you, you have to, to in order to continue smoking in anyway to block out some of those messages… 

00:57:25
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:57:25
AMELIA LYONS …to a certain degree or put them, well it's, it's like to put them in a little box that you put the later on in your mind some way, so you just it's like the, the rubbish post that you got. You know, you, you pile them up somewhere and eventually you have been in the sort a thing. 

00:57:40
MIKE SIMMONS Just a couple of things you might want to think about here, my sense in watching this video is that we are moving from loss to these issues around self-harm and now at this point we are very much in our heads. You may want to look back and see how that happened and think about what your minds have said that minds have kept a stronger focus, you might also want to think well, should we have stayed focused nonetheless. Is this issue as important as that issue, just think about it. 

00:58:15
AMELIA LYONS I think um, yes the more work on loss I would have liked you know looking back now it would have been nice, ah… it felt fine as the session was in itself, but yes if we were to look at some alternative parts that would have been quite a nice alternative path. And so, so try, so you don't open in the first place, you don't open the envelop, you just put it to the side and hope it goes, it goes away you know. 

00:58:45
MIKE SIMMONS I seen from the last year of college you had a no smoking day and this… 

00:58:50
AMELIA LYONS Alright. 

00:58:50
MIKE SIMMONS …may, may have been a year or two before that. 

00:58:55
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

00:58:55
MIKE SIMMONS I kind of wonder what happened then, was that a sort of one of those things… 

00:59:00
AMELIA LYONS Oh yeah definitely. 

00:59:00
MIKE SIMMONS …that's kind of not me… 

00:59:00
AMELIA LYONS Oh yeah, I mean what you know as, you know you have got to give up when you are absolutely, totally determined a nonsmoking day wouldn't do me any good. 

00:59:10
MIKE SIMMONS So like I showed… 

00:59:10
AMELIA LYONS Part time smokers, yeah… 

00:59:10
MIKE SIMMONS …kind of thing with the… 

00:59:10
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, part time smokers could probably mange that but not, not a proper smoker. 

00:59:15
MIKE SIMMONS Kind of professional. 

00:59:15
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah. 

00:59:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:59:20
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah and if you are only smoking a couple of packs a day your minds will carry on. Unfortunately, I'm not one of those people, who shall was… 

00:59:35
MIKE SIMMONS It's kind of anxious smile. 

00:59:35
AMELIA LYONS Hmm… yeah. 

00:59:40
MIKE SIMMONS I pick up on the smile there and I think that was useful to do, I think what might have been even more useful was to pick up on what that smile was doing for the client at that very moment. 

00:59:55
[sil.] 

01:00:00
AMELIA LYONS That was a good challenging use of silence and it made me come a little bit closer to my senses. 

01:00:10
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, quite a long silence, it still look that way on the tape, it seemed important not to break it, but to hold it and let my client do whatever she wanted to do in that space. 

01:00:25
AMELIA LYONS So the thought, I suppose the thought of you know in the evenings particularly, because I can imagine at work okay, it will be hard ah… but in the evening getting home particularly to you know that's, that's a nice thing to sort of look forward doing once since I always smoke all the time but you know, sit down with a cup of tea or a drink and a cigarette you know the first thing you do when you are relax and the thought of that not being there is gonna be hard. 

01:01:00
MIKE SIMMONS It's like you associate with everything… 

01:01:05
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah. 

01:01:05
MIKE SIMMONS …it feels like. 

01:01:05
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, I do yeah. 

01:01:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, a cup of coffee… 

01:01:05
AMELIA LYONS Hmm… 

01:01:05
MIKE SIMMONS …cigarette, telephone, cigarette, meeting, finishing the meeting. 

01:01:15
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

01:01:15
MIKE SIMMONS In… in a way kind of punctuates… 

01:01:15
AMELIA LYONS Yes. 

01:01:15
MIKE SIMMONS …your day. 

01:01:20
AMELIA LYONS It does, it does, it does exactly that. It does exactly that. I mean I suppose I can drawer on the time when I first gave up ah… where although it does punctuate everything, but some reason I think with work you kind of more distracted anyways, so you got things to do and you have to get on with them so, you can sort of get through it a bit, when you get home and that's like ah… you know a sort of a space that's when I know the first thing in the morning and the evenings is gonna be the worst time for me. 

01:02:00
MIKE SIMMONS Right, so you are kind of clear about whether, I guess where the dangers are. 

01:02:05
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

01:02:05
MIKE SIMMONS If it's something you want to do then starting smoking again will be a kind of failing at it and that's… 

01:02:15
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

01:02:15
MIKE SIMMONS …where you're, you are almost vulnerable of those points someday. 

01:02:20
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean I'm thinking what I'm, what I probably should do to crack the evening bit I use to get… before I did knitting and I just knitted you know scarf after scarf because that's the only think I can knit and I'm not, not very dexterous or anything. But it, I knew that it would help me because it was something to do with my hands or as now I think maybe I should go and get one of those sort of toughest three things just to keep my hands going. 

01:02:45
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:02:45
AMELIA LYONS Something very simple, because I don't care what the outcome of the thing is, as long as it keeps my hands occupied for a few weeks and probably a few months really. Because even the first time you know I had to knit all the time for about six months before I finally could let that bit go. 

01:03:05
MIKE SIMMONS If you're studying Egan(ph) ah… you might want to think about what on earth has just happened. Think about the steps and stages we seem to be talking about strategies quite suddenly was it appropriate to be doing that, is it a defense to be doing that or should we be talking still about the feelings underneath all this. I got this picture of you ah, at home… 

01:03:30
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

01:03:35
MIKE SIMMONS …doing something to occupy yourself. 

01:03:35
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

01:03:35
MIKE SIMMONS And closing your ears to the unsuitable friend that's… 

01:03:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

01:03:40
MIKE SIMMONS …knocking on the door, phoning you up. 

01:03:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

01:03:45
MIKE SIMMONS Say, well why not… 

01:03:45
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

01:03:45
MIKE SIMMONS And like you are under siege all of the time. 

01:03:45
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

01:03:50
MIKE SIMMONS You see I'm hopping on about this unsuitable friend I have got someone in mind it was an unsuitable friend of mine 30 something years ago his name was Marcus I could see him in our hall, what help is that to my client. She never met him. 

01:04:05
AMELIA LYONS Yes, I did feel he was going on about as a bit and but at the under siege was good you know, because of the bits all around it were fine then, then that was fine, but yeah, I did feel oh… you know unsuitable it was great thing for me. Yeah. 

01:04:25
MIKE SIMMONS And then working to a kind of developed strategies that would keep that friend obey. 

01:04:30
AMELIA LYONS That's right and break the associations. 

01:04:30
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, so I can… 

01:04:35
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

01:04:35
MIKE SIMMONS …I can drink coffee without smoking a cigarette. 

01:04:35
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah. I mean some of those is you just got to you know, by just sort of doing it and changing the carrying on doing exactly the same, but not smoking you do began to break the associations anyway. Ah… I know that from the past but, the… the yeah, there are certain times when it's much harder, much harder. And I got to be prepared for those times otherwise you know I'll make a mess of them. 

01:05:10
MIKE SIMMONS Make a mess? 

01:05:10
AMELIA LYONS Well, I'll go back you know, you know and listen very careful. 

01:05:15
MIKE SIMMONS What would that mean? 

01:05:20
AMELIA LYONS What? 

01:05:20
MIKE SIMMONS Going back. 

01:05:20
AMELIA LYONS Well, going back would be, it would be like a weak attempt and… I do, you know at this time I want to do it for good, I don't wanna to be messing about with weak attempt, it's gotta be proper fully fledged, full frontal attack. 

01:05:40
MIKE SIMMONS Alright, but I'm still not clear if you failed… 

01:05:45
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

01:05:45
MIKE SIMMONS …what is that saying? 

01:05:45
AMELIA LYONS Well, it's not the end of the world, but it might say that god if I fail again you know, am I ever really gonna stop smoking. 

01:05:55
MIKE SIMMONS Right. So that's a big back to… 

01:06:00
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

01:06:00
MIKE SIMMONS …this could be my last chance. 

01:06:00
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, there is… 

01:06:00
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, it's harder and harder. 

01:06:00
AMELIA LYONS …I suppose, I suppose that's right, yeah. 

01:06:05
MIKE SIMMONS So it makes it more important. 

01:06:10
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, it does yeah. 

01:06:10
MIKE SIMMONS We have got about five more minutes. 

01:06:15
AMELIA LYONS That was good I always like to be reminded of the time and when the time is running down, well if somebody just looks at their watch and doesn't say anything I, I feel nervous whereas if somebody is try to just open about it and says right you know, we have got five more minutes, I feel safe and… and sort of contained by him saying that. 

01:06:35
MIKE SIMMONS So it's more important now than ever before. 

01:06:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, it is. It is more important. 

01:06:45
[sil.] 

01:06:50
AMELIA LYONS Hmm… gotten the giggles. What I was feeling I was some kind of terrified really of having to do this and having to do it all on my own and that there was nobody else that could do this or could really help me as in I'm the one who has to give it up and so yes, that's… that's what I was feeling and the laughter was you know part of that terror and again it was good that he didn't go with that, but that we explored around that issue. 

01:07:35
MIKE SIMMONS I'm kind of get sense of go and then make me, yeah, make me, make it right you, you do it give me a cure. 

01:07:50
AMELIA LYONS Oh, I wish you could. 

01:07:50
MIKE SIMMONS Say, say the thing that will… 

01:07:55
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, took me over. 

01:07:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

01:08:00
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, well I think you know, I always struggling with that and certainly what I'm is, is you know that it's, you know a kind of stuckness and ambivalence really about it. You know and probably, you know a part of that might be the unsuitable friend coming out well and then make me a day you or something like that. 

01:08:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yep, in the end you can tell the client end of the thing. 

01:08:30
AMELIA LYONS And, you may haven't thought of it in that way particularly but that could be part of that I think and you know, I don't wanted a sort of thing. 

01:08:40
MIKE SIMMONS Don't want to… 

01:08:45
AMELIA LYONS Don't wanted, well a friend of mine has the saying where the, say I don't want to you know what, what to say? I don't have to, I don't want to and I ain't gonna. 

01:08:55
MIKE SIMMONS And is that give up? 

01:08:55
AMELIA LYONS That's, that sort of I'm not gonna do what you tell me to do sort of thing. 

01:09:00
MIKE SIMMONS Alright. 

01:09:00
AMELIA LYONS And it's, that was sort of values the expression and you know just sort of that I think that's the, that's the you know the two sort of polarities that you know, one part is you fucking gonna do this and the other part is I don't want to. 

01:09:20
MIKE SIMMONS So that's going on insight. 

01:09:25
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, I think so. 

01:09:25
MIKE SIMMONS But, but I got a bit of a sense as well of you saying to me kind of go on and leave me. 

01:09:30
AMELIA LYONS Right. 

01:09:30
MIKE SIMMONS And, and kind of pushing the responsibility on to me. 

01:09:35
AMELIA LYONS Right. 

01:09:35
MIKE SIMMONS So, so then you want me to push. 

01:09:40
AMELIA LYONS Right. 

01:09:40
MIKE SIMMONS And… and you can resist. 

01:09:40
AMELIA LYONS Right… right. That wasn't a conscious thing. 

01:09:45
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:09:45
AMELIA LYONS Because I do know I think the struggle is that I know it's all on me and I've got to do it you know nobody really can help me I mean we can do it through this and to do that, um… so yes, I can try and help the forces marshal the resources, but it's really it's down to me at the end of the day and that's I mean I wish that, I wish it was down to someone else you know it's on me and I have got to do it and that's you know that's bloody hard. 

01:10:20
MIKE SIMMONS To do alone? 

01:10:20
AMELIA LYONS It was good to reflect back the aloneness. Yeah it is. 

01:10:25
MIKE SIMMONS You have got to do it alone… 

01:10:25
AMELIA LYONS It is. 

01:10:25
MIKE SIMMONS …by definition. 

01:10:25
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

01:10:30
MIKE SIMMONS And that also makes it harder. 

01:10:30
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

01:10:30
MIKE SIMMONS And, and I guess the paradox is that it's the kind of thing that a cigarette would help you through the difficult times… 

01:10:40
AMELIA LYONS Hmm… hmm… 

01:10:40
MIKE SIMMONS …would be easier. 

01:10:45
AMELIA LYONS Hmm… hmm… yeah. 

01:10:50
MIKE SIMMONS And we are running out of time now. Just conscious of that unsuitable friend pushing, pushing that friend away and… 

01:11:00
AMELIA LYONS Yeah. 

01:11:00
MIKE SIMMONS …the difficulty of staying centered in you and what you want from him. 

01:11:10
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah, I mean there is, there is nothing to be done about it really it's you know, it's a barren landscape and it was gonna be hard. 

01:11:25
MIKE SIMMONS If you want to do this again maybe… 

01:11:25
AMELIA LYONS Hmm… hmm… 

01:11:25
MIKE SIMMONS …that landscape might be somewhere you would want to go. 

01:11:30
AMELIA LYONS Hmm… 

01:11:30
MIKE SIMMONS I don't know, but we've run out of time now. 

01:11:35
AMELIA LYONS Okay, thank you Mike. 

01:11:35
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. 

01:11:35
AMELIA LYONS The, the friend came back and I was… I was in touch with Mike's last comment about the aloneness so I was more in touch with that and the image that was coming out for me was that I said this sort of barren landscape and there I'm all alone on it. Ah… and then but he the friend went way again and, and Mike came in with well look I'm sort of here for you basically if you want another session. And that felt good so it felt like alright I was going out into this lonely landscape, but at the same time you know there was the support there which of course was also the supporting session. 

01:12:10
MIKE SIMMONS I kind of felt a bit unconformable about that intervention it felt a bit messy, I brought out my friend again, but somehow there was a messiness about what I was saying, I wasn't sure whether I was actually communicating very effectively at that moment. 

01:12:25
[sil.] 

01:12:30
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, that's the end of the session. All you know I feel pretty pleased with that, we kind of taking a part as we have gone along and clearly seen lots of things that worked as good as they could be some things that were unhelpful and so on, but we will always compare a video with perfection, but not expect to reach it, I think what I was doing was listening to my client, I was showing I was listening and it was establishing a relationship. If we were to go on to work further we would have a good place to start from.

AMELIA LYONS What I, yes, I think what you probably need to know here is, is just that there, there were a couple of things that Mike and I have acknowledged off camera about some of the deeper feelings that sort of came up and down for me at various points during the session which obviously because we were making this video for groups of people I wasn't going to… to share. So some of those have been acknowledged off camera and you… you probably need to be aware of just that and I suppose that in this tricky role of… of client which I got an awful lot out of doing those sessions, but I was always just having to watch myself just that little bit, because I am aware that this tape will you know it was already seen by lots of students and will be seen by lots more people. So I… I need to sort of just monitor my exposure levels and… and I was doing that throughout the session, so I think you need to be aware as the watcher that's, that there was a monitoring going on.

MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, I mean I guess for me there is something here about sure we are making a video, but sure we are working with real material. Ah, and how much do you push and how much do you challenge what's appropriate for the setting that you are working in. That's the end of our commentary, you might want to watch the tape all over again or then again, you can grab the film.

The School of Health and Social Sciences at the University of Wales, Newport is developing a wide range of videos and DVDs aimed at counselors, counseling trainers, their students and at anyone interested in developing their use of communication skills. We offer programs demonstrating good practice and bad practice. We give critiques for the use of counseling skills. And we explore the way in which those skills can be used in a variety of helping settings. Using a wide range of examples in an informative, but light-hearted manner, we look at the ways in which help and support and counseling can be offered, both in face to face work and over the telephone. We have also developed a series of programs in which key practitioners discuss their work and ideas. In this series in common with all the materials has been welcomed by many counseling trainers. Whether you are a trainer, a counselor a student or someone who uses counseling skills as part of their everyday work, we think that we will have something to interest you. Call for a brochure or visit our website and see what we have got to offer.
