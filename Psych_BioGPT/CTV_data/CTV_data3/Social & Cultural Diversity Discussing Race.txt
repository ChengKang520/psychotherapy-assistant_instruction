SHANNON DERMER Welcome! Thank you for joining us. I am Dr. Shannon Dermer and I am here today with Dr. Ellis. And we are going to be discussing the issue of race. We work together here at Governors State University. I am the Chair of the Division of Psychology and Counseling and Dr. Ellis why don't you tell everyone a little bit about yourself.

00:00:40
CYRUS ELLIS Oh very good! Thank you for having me. As you said I am Dr. Ellis, I'm an Associate Professor here at Governors State for about the last six-seven years and joined the faculty at Governors State in 2002 in the fall. And interesting to your question about telling me about myself the real… that really drives this topic of diversity, race and all that because I a teach a concept called person as instrument and it really describes for each person the kind of instrument that they are and what kind of shapes that. So for me, briefly said southern bread, the State of Louisiana with the grandparents from Mississippi, Louisiana respectively for my father and my mother and really was shaped by growing up in the south. So there is much I could say about that but that's really a large chunk of who I am and how I came to be here. 

00:01:40
SHANNON DERMER Well good. And being colleagues I obviously know a bit about your teaching style and your background and I know you often teach the diversity class and you focus a lot on the importance of race, how to talk about race. I know you've published in this area, that you speak in this area, so why is this such a passion for you as a counselor educator? 

00:02:00
CYRUS ELLIS One thing that's important that all counselors believe in is what motivates behavior that we as human beings engage in. And of one of those variables is race for me. Now I'm not talking about racism per se right now or anything racial in terms of some kind of behavior, really talking about the fact that we live in a world where a variable of who you are and how you're viewed and how you are dressed, one of those areas is race and I think it needs to have equal footing in terms of a discussion as well as the issues of your ability, whether you have one foot or two feet or you have a short leg or anything else that shapes the way people address you. 

00:02:45
SHANNON DERMER Alright. So there is a lot of different identities that shape who we are and how people treat us and how society sees us and treats us. So one of those variables that you… or identities that you like to talk about and make sure people are aware of is race. Now, I think a lot of times we talk about that for people who are considered part of marginalized populations or minority populations in the United States but the people who are in the majority also have a race, though we don't talk about it a lot of times. 

00:03:15
CYRUS ELLIS Yes, they do. And it's unique but really that's kind of the quandary that we find ourselves in and something that I've looked at all of the time. One of the concepts I use a lot is Helms's concept that she put out some years ago. It's a little bit dated but one I really still enjoy and it talks about with white racial identity that it operates off of three particular concepts of individual characteristics, institutional characteristics and cultural characteristics that shape "whiteness." And if you look, take all three one at a time to individual pieces that there are those that believe that a white way of behaving is the way to behave in terms of what we do and what we say. There is a way to say things, there is a way to sing things, there is a way to act overall and there are those that believe in the understanding of color dynamics, the white way to do it is the way to do it. There is the next step which is the institutional piece that laws and policies and norms such that Jim Crow was a major staple of that. That's the institutional way. Our laws, noise laws, laws that govern hospitals, laws that govern where people live and how to live, laws that govern the way commerce goes back and forth. We're all established by a particular race of people which by the way is the identity of those people. And lastly you have the cultural pieces. The things that we do that are more folklore, whether it be the cowboys and Indians over the issue of the great West migration, ‘Go West, young man', Manifest Destiny, all those kinds of concepts, those are cultural pieces that many people feel were denoted by a particular race of people, white people and therefore that is the way to be. And that by the way shapes identity you begin to see that when you begin to see the phenomena of rap take hold and you had one group saying well that's crazy that we're acting and saying these things. But if you go back in time, Elvis Presley who is a renowned artist and certainly a major American icon, but at the beginning of his trajectory while he was denounced by the music he played and denounced by the… 

00:06:00
SHANNON DERMER And the way he moved. 

00:06:00
CYRUS ELLIS And the way he moved. 

00:06:00
SHANNON DERMER Elvis the Pelvis. 

00:06:05
CYRUS ELLIS Yes. The way he moved and who he actually hung out with on Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee. He was not hanging with established white artists. He was hanging with some established although subculture black artists. So the question was is he one of us by doing that yes or no and when that debate starts, now you're talking about that divide of white culture, which is also identity and that which is not. 

00:06:30
SHANNON DERMER Yeah, and so going back to, you said like the individual characteristics and things like that that, I think some of the things that you are saying whether there was institutionally, individually or societal culture that… there is this history and a continuing lingering remnants of that white culture sets the standard of what is best or how to be successful or what is right. 

00:06:55
CYRUS ELLIS In our Western world. 

00:07:00
SHANNON DERMER Yes. 

00:07:00
CYRUS ELLIS When you look at the dimension of how the nation was established, there was a question of who is culturally refined and who is savage. When you looked at the influx of slavery of what promotes an individual or a collective group of individuals to establish who can be enslaved, it has to fall down to what is humane and what is not and you look at the fact that we saw slavery as inhumane over time. But there was a prevailing thought that well for these people it is not as inhumane because of who is enslaved. 

00:07:45
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:07:45
CYRUS ELLIS There is an interesting… one of our colleagues in the profession named Schmidt who has a concept called personalist economics that goes through this topic and we're economics as a whole is about goods and services being provided in people than purchase those goods and services. Schmidt brought out the concept of personals economics that hits on this topic because he talks about there's a question not on what should be sold or offered but who should offer those goods and services. It's not that we need a doctor, it's who should be that doctor, who should be that president, who should be that mayor, who should be that fire marshal and those kinds of questions. And if you look at the way Jim Crow laid itself out, it really landed on that concept Schmidt put forward on who should be the nurse, who should be the schoolteacher, who should be those things. And we still struggle with that in global politics who should be president. Should it be a man, should it be a woman as we are currently involved in. And over the last eight years should it be a black man, should it be somebody else, who, who, who really drives that question. 

00:09:00
SHANNON DERMER Which is an important question and I think that some people in the general public and counselors and things like that, they struggle with the idea of like okay, you say who should do that yet now in our world we don't have slavery anymore, we don't… in the United States, legal slavery. We don't have Jim Crow laws anywhere, that's the past, why are you talking about that who should be president where we have a Barack Obama as president. 

00:09:25
CYRUS ELLIS Yes, we do. 

00:09:30
SHANNON DERMER Who should be the doctor where we have top doctors who are African-American. So why is that still an important question. 

00:09:35
CYRUS ELLIS Well, now we're talking beyond this very concept, Pike is a colleague of ours who speaks to this issue because when you look at oppression, the manipulation of one group for the benefit of another group which is the construct for that word oppression, you look at what Pike speaks about with internalized oppression and other concepts like that internalized racism. Oppression is not a one-dimensional avenue. Some people think that yes, slavery was oppressive when we understand that. Women who before particular members of the Constitution were present, now that's over with as well. So these singular dimensions are oversold than all the other pieces are to go white. Well Pike really describes this concept thoroughly by saying, "oppression is not a single dimension, it is not just a matter of Jim Crow laws, that are now been taken from the books although it took a long time to get all of them out." 

00:10:40
SHANNON DERMER And some people say there is still a pulling thing, it's kind of linger if you look at… 

00:10:45
CYRUS ELLIS If you look deep enough they are still sitting there. 

00:10:45
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:10:45
CYRUS ELLIS But that's a dimension of oppression that drives the internal mechanisms of individuals. You still have inequity in pay. We are still arguing over female pay to male pay, it's still a headline in our national politics. We still have the inequity in our criminal justice system. Who's more likely to be arrested, who's more likely to be stopped and freezed, who's more likely to be pulled over, who gets the benefit of the doubt more than not. That's another layer of this legacy of oppression that slavery was a label of women's issues were a label of. So when you look at Pike's work in this area you start to realize we have to still talk about it because even though the major headlining dimensions that drove oppression in the 1800s and maybe even the 1700th and before are gone, not the other layers of oppression. The boardroom is still locked out for many women. Major institutions of higher education terms at their presidency and their provost positions are locked out to minorities and/or women depending on how you see that. We say and/or because sometimes women are not minorities depending on race and sometimes they are depending on gender. 

00:12:10
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:12:15
CYRUS ELLIS And my brothers and sisters who are of the LGBTQ population and if they're open in their lifestyle which I wish they would be, our society finds ways to cut them at the knee. So those issues still exist and that's why this topic is still relevant to be discussed. 

00:12:30
SHANNON DERMER Good. So if I have you correct then, you are saying okay even though some of the laws don't exist on the book anymore or people don't overtly say certain things or there aren't overt laws, that there are still remnants at all of those levels, the individual, the institutional, the cultural that no there may not be a law that differentiates between you know, white and black but how some of those laws are enforced… 

00:12:55
CYRUS ELLIS Exactly. When you hear the debates talk about we should make English the official language of the United States of America, certainly one can understand the genesis of that argument. But when it goes down the course it goes, it starts to tap into institutional and cultural beliefs that are a little bit segregating and also racist to a degree that you want to eliminate that dialogue when different languages are spoken by certain people because it's not American, it is not something. And when you begin to find the American way of life, you know I am a veteran so I support the American way of life and for 20 years of my being as well, but there are those that take it that with it being present America cannot be America anymore so we must eliminate it. When those kinds of discussions begin now you tap into what Helms calls the institutional and cultural piece and what Pike calls the reason why we start to develop a dislike of things that we are because as we seek to be ourselves we find roadblocks at every given turn. 

00:14:10
SHANNON DERMER That's the internalized remnant oppression. 

00:14:15
CYRUS ELLIS That's where the internalized comes from because the oppression dimension, the manipulation of a group for the benefit of another group hasn't ended. We manipulate voters at every term. We manipulate the poor, we manipulate the rich to stay rich and the rich to be against the poor, we manipulate the working class, we manipulate the elite class, they are not free from this and that's why the identity pieces or so strong because you can fall into what Dr. Cornel what's called the pitfall. You can fall into this automatic belief system that there is an us and a them. And because there are those manipulating that concept or multiple concepts of oppression, it's still relevant to talk about. 

00:15:00
SHANNON DERMER And, I know we are going to have a discussion a little bit, we are going to do kind of a little bit more of an interview around race and right now we are just kind of talking about some basic concepts. But one of things you're alluding to is white privilege. Do you think most of white America understands what white privilege is? 

00:15:15
CYRUS ELLIS No, I don't think they do. It's a concept that exists as a scholar when you study and you can just denote these variables that kind of drive our cultural landscape but a great many do not understand white privilege because they are of the working class. I mean, I grew up like that person as instrument thing I talked about before. One of the things that shaped me was my father's work life, he was a truck driver and all kind of truck drivers existed in the 70s when I was coming up. And when you're working hard and your hands are callous and you're sweating and you have the scars of a working life, you don't see the fact that you're privileged because your environment doesn't speak to that. 

00:16:05
SHANNON DERMER You don't feel privileged looking at your callous hands. 

00:16:05
CYRUS ELLIS You don't have the caviar, you don't have the maids and all those kinds of images that would support a privileged lifestyle. But what those who would oppress like to do is make the gain of others become a threat to you and I saw that growing up when unions were being discussed in a certain truck yards where there weren't any unions while there were those that would set the stage that unions are bad for business. You know, even seatbelts. You have to look this up to really know what I'm speaking of but I do this on a regular basis, Lee Iacocca great man in auto… 

00:16:50
SHANNON DERMER Chrysler, Chrysler, right. 

00:16:50
CYRUS ELLIS Yes. In auto industry but when seatbelts were made mandatory he was one that said it would undermine and collapse the auto industry. 

00:17:00
SHANNON DERMER They likely used fear and pitting people against each other. 

00:17:05
CYRUS ELLIS And that's where oppression lies and I think a lot of people don't see that dimension when it comes to white privilege because it's not that when I move to a town like you like me any man any woman, you want to carry your hair and buy clothes and all those kind of great things but we tend to find where our choices for clothing or barbers or beauty parlors or whatever, they're not in a general location in many cases, they are put in particular neighborhoods. And the influx of other neighborhoods coming in contact with other neighborhoods sometimes is spun as a threat. And most people who want to raise good families and raise good children and see their kids do better than they have done will become a bit protective and there are people that know that and they tend to spin that. And that's where white privilege comes in because they just tend to set it up as you can't be in the 1970s Kumbaya moment and all of us singing and dancing and loving together you have to have some degrees of separation and when that occurs it will fall to the American psyche and when that happens you fall back into the individual, institutional and cultural norms that are set up by a Dominic culture as the way to be. And that's what you see when school systems talk about we won't have Cinco de Mayo, we won't have Kwanzaa, we won't have black history month and all those other celebrations as a means to think that we're deluding or taking away from the American fabric which they define which is why some schools are now talking about teaching only a set of American history, not a complete dialogue in American history. 

00:19:05
SHANNON DERMER Yeah, I think what you're talking about really is sometimes when people see being inclusive is having to give up part of who they are. 

00:19:10
CYRUS ELLIS Exactly. 

00:19:10
SHANNON DERMER And I know we only have like a minute more before we go to our demonstration but also I think… we are talking a little bit about white privilege in there and I think that's one of the topics that counselors and students in general struggle with the most because kind of like you talk about the like what, I'm not rich, I'm having to take out loans to go to school, I'm not this… I didn't hurt anybody but they don't, they don't recognize that they have still benefited from the… even though they are not doing anything necessarily to be racist, they have still benefited from some of the advantages that have been in history and made it more likely that they would get educated… 

00:19:50
CYRUS ELLIS One of the… yes. 

00:19:50
SHANNON DERMER That they are not followed around, that they are you know… 

00:19:50
CYRUS ELLIS One of the subtleties of white privilege is that you really don't have to ask about it. 

00:19:55
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:19:55
CYRUS ELLIS Because it is more likely in a history book you will see and understand a narrative about how we came to be… 

00:20:05
SHANNON DERMER From a white perspective. 

00:20:05
CYRUS ELLIS From a white perspective and even a male perspective if I even go that far. But the internalized pieces that young people struggle with is still to this day generating long from the color preference studies about black dolls and white dolls and all that is that wow! Modern kids don't see themselves represented in the shaping of this great nation. And that is a exclamation point of what white privilege is. 

00:20:35
SHANNON DERMER And I'm sure we could talk about this for a lot longer. 

00:20:35
CYRUS ELLIS All day long. 

00:20:35
SHANNON DERMER But I want to make sure to get to our interview soon. 

00:20:35
CYRUS ELLIS Very good. 

00:20:35
SHANNON DERMER Let's end here. 

00:20:40
SOCIAL & CULTURAL DIVERSITY: 

00:20:40
DISCUSSING RACE 

00:20:40
INTERVIEW 

00:20:40
with Cyrus Ellis, Ph.D. 

00:20:40
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:20:45
SHANNON DERMER Dr Ellis. Thank you for joining me. What we are going to do here is I am going to do a little bit of an interview to hopefully help people become even more comfortable with discussing race and to be able to do that with basically anyone. So I am just going to ask you a few questions and I am going to start out with the most basic one which is although a complex answer, I am sure. What makes race such a complex issue? 

00:21:10
CYRUS ELLIS I think the answer to that question really flows to our historical context. One thing I like to make sure people understand, nothing we're talking about today emanates from today. It has an historical context to it in races one of those pieces we find, even one of my favorite television shows is the Ten Commandments back with Charlton Heston and all the people, it was a race-based description of slavery for Egyptians and my Jewish brothers and sisters and so it was a matter of race. And coming across the waters, finding the new world was a matter of race and the context that we are wrapped around, on how we see whites, how we see blacks, how we see our Mexican brothers and so forth is really what shapes that and till we get a handle on that it's going to be one for a long time. So it's not that my word today discusses race, it's that history has always discussed race and so I discuss it also. 

00:22:25
SHANNON DERMER Okay and what exactly shapes race-based attitudes then across time? 

00:22:30
CYRUS ELLIS Very good question, one of the things that I have discovered is the concept of relationships. That historical context about race at one point by some colleagues named Omi and Winant back in the 80s talked about race as issues of similarity. Where noses and hair and body types all were the same so you have a race of people from the hills and you have a race of people from the jungle and you have a race of people from the coast and so forth. But now we understand race to be about relationships. When you talk about 10 black guys are outside of a movie theater, nowadays with the current headlines is a white guy outside of a movie theater, you know that's going to spark a race-based understanding. Because relationships play a role in this and that's really what we have. We talk about American slave trade you have an understanding about who that represents. You talk about the Jewish slavery time in our history of the world that brings about a particular group of people in your mind. So the relationships that center around race is really what's crucial here. And when you talk about there goes the neighborhood phrases we use to use, maybe we still use them but I know we used them in my youth, we're talking about a particular group of people with particular mannerisms sometimes stereotype mannerisms but still a particular type of mannerisms coming into your neighborhood. That is what shape that discussion. And so until we understand we're talking about relationships and do we match up with those relationships, then we'll always have a problem talking about race. 

00:24:25
SHANNON DERMER And we've been using that word race but what's the difference between race as a people and race as a color? 

00:24:30
CYRUS ELLIS Well, for me those two don't go as separate as race and ethnicity tends to happen. I remember the first time I met an African in college and she was Caucasian by my view of her, then I well, wait a minute, something is not right because she is South African and I had to grow to understand that in Africa which has been shaped primarily as that's where black people are, no there are other people there as well and some of them yes or Caucasian. The same that Malcolm X had to understand when he went to see Muslims of all different hues when he made his pilgrimage. So we have to recognize we are shaped by this discussion. Africans are black and Europeans or white until you meet Lennox Lewis who boxes for Great Britain who is a Brit and sounds as ever much like any Brit would sound except he looks what we call black. Those are the real pitfalls of this discussion and I think we haven't lost that yet. I recently went to England and was amazed even with what I think I know about this world to see the various hues of what it means to be a Brit. And how they all share what it means to be a Brit in language and indeed what their physical representation, their pigmented crate stick not the same. I picked that up from Cornel West… 

00:26:05
SHANNON DERMER I was like that was a good word. But I was going to… I mean, obviously what you're… what you are implying and overtly saying is that race is such a complex, race and color is such a complex issue but how does that complexity you think foster self-hatred and internalized oppression? 

00:26:25
CYRUS ELLIS Well that's really where the rub is. That's really where the rub is. When you examine popularity, when you examine wealth, when you examine social status that comes with a picture. This is why the issue of imagery is so important to me about what looks like it's correct, who should be the person behind the wheel of the Lexus, who should be driving the Mercedes, who ought to be in the big mansion on the hill. We have shaped that dialogue so much so in terms of color that it really drives the train on why we might find ourselves loathing who we are, not only who we are in skin color but who we are in body type. Whether we're tall or short or bigger or not as big as me might want to be, because we have shaped that dialogue of what's beautiful. We have shaped the dialogue of what's attractive. And until recently, well, that was a cookie-cutter understanding. I mean I grew up in the Cheryl Tiegs days of what a cover model should look like but also in body type that weren't in terms of what we called twiggy where Calvin Klein did back in the 90s. so we have shaped the dialogue such that if we are opposite that dialogue… and this by the way is also what's involved with people who are in the dominant culture who struggle with image issues and self-loathing. Because they look at the individual or institutional or cultural representations of beauty or attractiveness or wealth or status and find that they're outside of it. Now that's one thing to be a young white female who is brunette with brown eyes wanting to be a blonde with blue eyes. What if you're in a total different pigmentation to begin with? Then when you find out who gets to be a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader, who gets to be the quarterback, who gets to be the CEO, who is accepted to Harvard, who is accepted to Princeton and I'm naming just some of the overt stereotypes out there, but who gets the prom date that's of status and who does not that is very self-loathing. I had the same issue growing up. I wondered why my representation, my Afro and the piece pick that we did back in the 70s was not on television. Fonzie was not me in my generation mind you. Blake Carrington of dynasty frame was not me. Now I use TV because art imitates life and we struggle with that. the TV stars and the movie stars, why did I love the Jackson 5 so much. It wasn't just because the music was good but I saw something else, I saw Donna Summer and I am like wow! Look at Donna Summer. These were images not just individuals for me and for many people they were images not just artists. And until we get our heads wrapped around that, it becomes something of a struggle. And when you again are outside of that understanding, why don't we want Latinas to be on movies and not in the gang role. Why do we want the Huggy Bears to be a bit lower and some more Sidney Poitiers to be leading men is because of the issue that we have around the color, dynamic in our American history. And that's still there, we still struggle with that. 

00:30:15
SHANNON DERMER Yeah, so say a little bit more than about, talk about the racial bias. 

00:30:20
CYRUS ELLIS The racial bias is the preference issue where talent and that's what King called for is still second-place to what we want to see. You know the argument back in my 80s was that the light-skinned brothers will get everything. Less fearful to white America to have light-skinned brothers in business and so forth. It's really something that we really pull from our slave days and slave times when we talk about who could work in that house and who worked in the field. The lighter-skinned brothers tend to work in the house, they were less fearful to the white owners and the darker skin, black males were more in the fields because the folklore about who we are at night and these are old folklore that black men grew tales at night and black men became this other entity at night really drove to keep them separate. So when you are bias racially you lose sight of talent, you lose sight of ability and you have your preference on what you want to sit next to, what you want to work next to, what you want to see as attractive. One of the great books of a black literature which ought to be in all literature is this book by Wallace Thurman called The Blacker the Berry and that also has connotation for black folklore, I am not going to say it right now but the book details a dark skinned black woman who goes to exhaustive lengths to lighten her skin so that she can sit at the front of the bus, sit in the front seat of the car whereas the folklore was the darker you are the further back you go. So those kinds of dynamics and if you live with that, you are biased. I mean we have it in within what we call a within group bias, meaning within the black culture solely. That two dark-skinned people maybe ought not marry. That's been a thing because the children will come out dark. And those kinds of concepts around the within group discussion has permeated to without group discussions as well. So when you grow up and you look in the mirror what do you see? Do you get the accolades of my beautiful daughter or my beautiful son or my masculine man? Now in later days, the Black Civil Rights Movement of the late 60s that began to change certainly in the later days that has begun to change, but still there are many pockets and when you throw in oppression which again is the manipulation of people for the benefit of other people, that still exists. So people do look at the makeup, the eyelashes, the colored contacts, the hair straightening devices of today as still an implicit dimension of racial bias. And then when employers seek to only hire people who are closer to the white way of living, then again a racial bias still exists. So people will have to examine themselves on whether or not the Afro on a black female is as attractive in the workplace or in the classroom or any other place as the straightened hair. Because whether we know that or not that falls along the lines of racial bias. 

00:33:50
SHANNON DERMER Okay. You've been giving us a lot of terms and ideas to think about that have related you know, across time, but what about some of the current issues right now. Like the debate about the Confederate flag, the debate or not the debate but the heated discussions about some of the police shootings, talk a little bit about some of those. 

00:34:10
CYRUS ELLIS Well, we'll start with this the tragedy in Charleston and losing life first of all at any way like that is horrendous and it's a heinous crime. And no one ought to lose their life over things like that. but when you look at the gentleman in question who committed the crime, in his manifesto as it were, he speaks to everything I have talked about. He recalls in his own manifesto the stereotypical dimension and the shaped discussion dimension of black life. Crime-ridden, violent, rapist, all the things history has taught he has reinvented in his own manifesto. He wore the imagery of hatred so that he would be girded up as the Bible would talk about to carry out this heinous crime. And he spoke to the fact that there are enough of white people speaking to the individual, institutional and cultural beliefs in his manifesto standing up to thwart that gain or thwart their presence in society. So here you have an individual who sought out to commit a crime which maybe he didn't think was a crime based on the way he believes and wanted to document the fact that he is doing that which history has said needs to be done. And that dimension is maybe for some it's archaic in its understanding but not for me. But he sought to do this thing at that time in that place which also has historical ramifications. This is what I mean by historical context. He didn't pick any place, he picked a church whose history is to fight against that supremacy and that privilege. So he did all these things not based on what those particular nine people did to him but what history says they represent by the color of their skin and the history of that relationships that they belong to and that's really what needs to be the discussion. So when a Confederate flag comes in play we begin to ask the question, if it is about heritage then you must tell the whole story. He chose the part that was divisive, mooring an supremacy lady and that's why he wore it on his jacket and that's why he had it in the front of his car and that's what he went out to do. 

00:36:55
SHANNON DERMER Alright, so the shootings in Charleston where you know this white guy went in and shot up historically black church, well I mean it was a black church… 

00:37:05
CYRUS ELLIS A historically black church… 

00:37:10
SHANNON DERMER Yeah and had a… what I meant was it had a big part in history, a lot of important people had visited there, it's kind of a beacon for people and… it was nine people, right. 

00:37:20
CYRUS ELLIS Nine. 

00:37:20
SHANNON DERMER That he killed and injured others that for you that wasn't just about one man… 

00:37:25
CYRUS ELLIS No. 

00:37:25
SHANNON DERMER And his racial issues, I mean, he chose Charleston, this famous church, you know and then killed nine black people. 

00:37:35
CYRUS ELLIS And particularly sought out the pastor who was a state senator. 

00:37:40
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:37:40
CYRUS ELLIS But again if you read his manifesto and sometimes when you look at the Confederate flag issue, it streams into our Constitution, it streams into First Amendment Rights, I find that unique because that's what they want to separate from, but that's another discussion for another day. But it streams into all that we have a right as Americans to speak to these things and to display these things which I don't directly argue. But I read what the man believed by his own handwriting that I must do something to stop and cease these actions by not those nine, I mean a 73-year-old grandmother is not really doing the things he said, but he wants to stop the actions of what those black people represented. And the flag is one example, he also had the Aryan nation symbol as well which is an abhorrent thing to Jews, Catholics and those other folks as well, he want to stop what those relationships meant. He had to stop that. He felt no other white person was doing that. And when he put it in those terms, it is beyond just Charleston and that church. It is to a nation's flag that represented we have a right to enslave and he wanted to see why others aren't acting in that way. And he's not and this is where privilege comes in because we need my white brothers and sisters to stand up and say that's not me and we need to have my black brothers and sisters say no that's not you all either. Because it gets wrapped up as an us and them and that's where Dr. West talks about the pitfall, we can't fall into that, we cannot go back to us and them dynamic. But we have to be truthful about what this person's intents were. And at least this time we got his own words to do that. 

00:39:40
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So, I mean you have covered a lot of things, so just in like one minute or less, one concluding thought that you want everyone to walk away with. 

00:39:50
CYRUS ELLIS A task, certainly to do that. First to walk away with that we cure this by talking about this. I wrote an article about counselors addressing race and one of the things I talk about is that we can't defend when we have the discussion. So I wouldn't want you preparing rebuttal to what I'm saying but I have to be clear on not accusing you to be party to that which I'm talking about. If we can get that established, we have a better chance to cure this. It is not impossible is write what family love and write what history and all those great things, but tomorrow is shaped by what we do today. Our history can't shape tomorrow. 

00:40:45
SHANNON DERMER Great! So the one thing if you want people, you know if they don't remember anything else that it's important to talk about race because we cure this by talking about it. 

00:40:55
CYRUS ELLIS Talking about it. 

00:40:55
SHANNON DERMER Thank you very much Dr. Ellis. 

00:40:55
CYRUS ELLIS Alright. 

00:41:00
SOCIAL & CULTURAL DIVERSITY: 

00:41:00
DISCUSSING RACE 

00:41:00
WRAP-UP 

00:41:00
with Cyrus Ellis, Ph.D. 

00:41:00
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:41:05
SHANNON DERMER Dr. Ellis, thank you so much for letting me interview you a little bit on the importance of talking about race and having a frank discussion about race. 

00:41:10
CYRUS ELLIS Yeah, my pleasure. 

00:41:10
SHANNON DERMER I want you to talk a little bit, I mean you are passionate about this subject, I think as an advocate as an African-American man but also specifically as a counselor educator, someone who trains future counselors. So why do you think from a counseling perspective this is such an important topic to talk about? 

00:41:35
CYRUS ELLIS Humanistically and wellness all the great things that make up our profession, race and really not race itself, but really the negative dimensions that society still throws on race is something that does not promote wellness. And it can get overshadowed by all the other things that we as counselor educators are concerned about. And I just know that what I call my 2 AM syndrome. When you're up at night and you're struggling and you're hurting, there are many things that can be provoking that and this is one of them. And as far as I'm concerned that's something that needs to be talked about because for those that understand this and are using it in the wrong way, they still filter it out into our society and our culture and I think we need to be guarding it against that. 

00:42:25
SHANNON DERMER Okay, so you are saying it's not really race that it's a problem, it's our social construction of race that is a problem. 

00:42:30
CYRUS ELLIS Exactly! That's really the problem. It's something that we have not yet addressed. Du Bois called it the problem of the 20th century. And now that we're in the 21st century it's still there. 

00:42:45
SHANNON DERMER You make your students read Du Bois, don't you. 

00:42:45
CYRUS ELLIS I do. 

00:42:45
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:42:50
CYRUS ELLIS I do. I think they need to read what reconstruction was like from another perspective because his book Souls of Black Folk was written about over that period of time of his life and then he wrote it in 1903 or published in 1903 so he spoke about the ups and downs of reconstruction. 

00:43:05
SHANNON DERMER Well I have read some of his work and he was brilliant and actually he was talking about some of what you talked about in our in-show of like people living in different spots and who can be the doctor and who can be the preacher and who can be those for. 

00:43:20
CYRUS ELLIS Yes, right. 

00:43:20
SHANNON DERMER There were black teachers, there were black doctors… 

00:43:25
CYRUS ELLIS Yes, there was. 

00:43:25
SHANNON DERMER But they could only be that for… 

00:43:25
CYRUS ELLIS Their own. 

00:43:25
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:43:25
CYRUS ELLIS The issue he calls it… he calls it competition of the races. That we may find poor whites living next to poor Blacks or affluent Blacks but you never really find poor Blacks living next to affluent whites. His view of culture was that we have to deal with this competition of the races and commerce was one of those dimensions as other pieces were. 

00:43:50
SHANNON DERMER Great! And I think it's great that you make them read, like I said he was brilliant but also we can't, you know the old saying you can't forget the past or you are doomed to repeat it, but he had a lot of things that I think apply just as much today as they did… 

00:44:00
CYRUS ELLIS Well, not only do you have to read Du Bois for those very concepts, I also make them read Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce Indians, it's a French way to say that, but I mess it up. But how Chief Joseph talked about the days of the Indian Wars and how he told the President Hayes actually that laws are for everybody not just for my Indians. And if you would enforce the laws for everyone, I will be the first to make sure my Indians follow along. He spoke about how his people are shutdown in the streets as if they were animals. He made the parable of if a horse is tied to a stake, do you expect it to thrive. These underlining issues that have been present in the formation of our nation for so long are not just for African-Americans, they are there for the Native Americans, they are there for women there, they are there for so many. And they still exist and they still provoke a little heartache and pain. And I would like to see us relieved from that. That's one of my aims as a counselor educator. 

00:45:10
SHANNON DERMER What I know and when you teach diversity, it's not just about race, you talk about all of those things, you talk about gender, you talk about sexual or factional orientation, you talk about religion and physical ability, you know a lot of those things but there are a few things that I think are just harder for people to talk about as we discussed and race is still a difficult one for people to talk about. 

00:45:35
CYRUS ELLIS Race is one of them. I actually try to teach race by first speaking of the gender issues and speaking of the LGBTQ issues because there's a significant history in both of those. And then when I come around to race, I show the images, I show the jokes, I show a lot of the things that are in our fabric, I mean it's there and In Living Color, a historical TV show was one that made fun of race Key and Peele today's comics they make fun of a lot of racial issues. I show old Archie Bunker or All in the Family episodes in class to get this point across. But students have a hard time dealing with that. For some it's great because they never heard of the stuff I'm talking about and maybe you think we moved ahead until we start talking about vocational, educational gains by women, men, people of color. We have to teach immigration as a CACREP standard now so that people understand the immigration debate. And a lot of things fall back to those individual, institutional and cultural beliefs that really drive why we are handicapping so many. It's my belief that we are losing out on the inner-city because there's potential there. Being a humanist type therapist, there is so much potential in the inner-cities but we have barriers to tapping it and they fall to those three areas that Helms talks about. 

00:47:10
SHANNON DERMER Great! You know you just remind me of something when you are talking about humanist and things like that that I don't think I ever asked you in the introduction or in our interview to define what do you mean specifically when you say person as an instrument and why that's important to diversity conversations? 

00:47:30
CYRUS ELLIS Person as instrument, I picked this up at UVA when I was a doctoral student there and it really goes to describe not to the question you're asking but who is asking it. I really want to know what's behind the question rather than just focus on the mechanics of the question. You ought to know if I say why I say yes ma'am and no ma'am, it's not just that I have manners which might be a lost art, it's because I'm southern race. Now when I was in a school I had a feminist professor who was worried about my southern upbringing as if in therapy I would seek to save the female who suffered and not allow her to work through… 

00:48:10
SHANNON DERMER To empower herself. 

00:48:15
DR. CYRUS ELLIS …the issues that she has and empower her own self-care because sometimes the southern men are taught to hug the women better that allow them to earn themselves to get better and she was concerned about that. And that's really trying to figure out who is asking the question versus what question is being asked. So as an instrument what shapes me, if you take a metal slab and you beat it to make the sword or the saber, the hammer is shaping that metal. So what shapes me? Is it the music of the South, of course it is. Is it the jazz of the South? Of course it is. But it's also the rules of the South, it's also the manner of the south, it's also the heat of the south. And all those things come back into play when I visit the south. You see the symbols and you recognize while faded still present, you recognize the culture of the South. For example my grandfather Victor Ellis Sr. and my grandmother Marvina are buried in Biloxi City Cemetery, beautiful place right at the Gulf of Mexico, but they're in the segregated side of the cemetery. And although it's 2015 when I stand there to pay my respects, I look across the railroad tracks and I see the non-segregated side. And I'm saying even in death my grandfather couldn't rest. So, you see that, it is not that that way today but it's still present. 

00:49:50
SHANNON DERMER And still influences you and it's a still… 

00:49:50
CYRUS ELLIS It's still an… 

00:49:50
SHANNON DERMER Always in the background. 

00:49:50
CYRUS ELLIS It's still an influence on me. I am an instrument for my profession whether it's in the counseling room or in the classroom. So, those things still shape me. My hope for the future shapes me as an instrument. That I'm not really against my white brothers and sisters or my Jewish brothers and sisters or my Indian brothers and sisters, my gay brothers and sisters but… because I have hope for the future so a lot of things shape me. I want my students to understand what shapes them explicitly and greater than that implicitly. And a lot of times you have to provoke the soul to get to the implicit. 

00:50:35
SHANNON DERMER Great! Well thank you, that's a great explanation of person as a instrument that although people say, oh leave yourself at the therapy room door… 

00:50:45
CYRUS ELLIS Impossible. 

00:50:45
SHANNON DERMER And that's impossible to do. 

00:50:50
CYRUS ELLIS If we could do that we wouldn't have an ethical code. 

00:50:50
SHANNON DERMER That's true! Very good point and I would love to speak to you more about this but we're just… I'm an instrument of time and in this and we need to wrap up and so I want to thank you for this great open conversation about race and diversity. And I want to thank all of you for joining us for CACREP Essential Skills for Counseling Practice and I hope that you feel a little bit more open and free to go in and discuss race with your colleagues, your clients and your supervisors. Thank you.
