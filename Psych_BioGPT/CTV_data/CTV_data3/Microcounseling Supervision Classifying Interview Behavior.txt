Microcounseling Supervision: Helping Students Classify and Rate Interview Behavior, Using the Counseling Interview Rating Form Nancy E. Sherman, Ph.D. 

00:00:00
NANCY E. SHERMAN, PH.D.  Hello. I'm Dr. Nancy Sherman, and my colleague, Dr. Lori Russell-Chapin, and I are pleased to present to you a teaching and evaluation tool called the Counseling Interview Rating Form. On this videotape, Dr. Russell-Chapin and I will describe the uses of the counseling interview rating form as well as show how to use it to enhance teaching and supervision of counseling trainees. As we progress, follow along with the copy of the counseling interview rating form provided with this videotape. The counseling interview rating form was designed to assist in teaching and evaluating the microcounseling approach, the counselor's school training described by Allen Ivey and others. The counseling interview rating form has been used for the past six years in beginning and advanced skill level counseling courses, and an accredited training program in school and agency counseling. The counseling interview rating form provides a format for evaluating the five stages of the interview as described by Ivey and the microcounseling skills used in the counseling interview. The counseling interview rating form is divided into six sections that correspond to the five stages plus an additional section on professionalism. Listed within each section are skills or tasks seen in that stage of the interview. The opening section, for example, includes the specific criteria of greeting, role definition, administrative task, and beginning. While watching a videotape to a live session, the person completing the counseling interview rating form tallies the number of times a certain skill is used. Then, values are assigned to indicate the level of mastery achieved for each skill. Reviewers provide a mastery rating of 1, 2, or 3 for each of 43 listed skills that might be used in the session. A score of 1 on a skill that indicates that the skill was observed. A 2 denotes mastery of the skill, and a score of 3 is used when the counselor's observed teaching the skill effectively. If using the counseling interview rating form for assigning grades to a session, please refer to the instructions on the form itself. Grades are calculated by totaling the ratings within a corresponding to 52 or more points. This cut off score was determined by scoring in the mastery range on all essential skills denoted by an X on the counseling interview rating form. At this point, you will see a demonstration of a supervision session using the counseling interview rating form. Dr. Lori Russell-Chapin will briefly review how to use the counseling interview rating form with her students and then the group will watch a segment of one of the trainees videotaped work with a client. All three will complete the counseling interview rating form while viewing the tape and then process their results. As you watch the videotaped counseling session, complete the counseling interview rating form so that you can compare your ratings with the group's assessment. 

00:03:50
Lori A. Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. 

00:03:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Melissa and Wes, I really appreciate you're joining us today. As you know, we're gonna be doing supervision for you Wes... (crosstalk) 

00:04:00
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:04:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...uhm, using a client of yours and uhm, I know we received consent form to use his tape. So the several things I'd like to think about today uhm, I need you to think about what kind of counseling supervision questions you'd like Melissa and me to answer for you, and then uhm, we will be using the counseling interview rating form to assess the supervision. I thought probably what we should do first, ah, I know this is a form that you are very familiar with but I thought what we should do is go through it a little bit, run through it one more time as a quick review. Does that sound okay? 

00:04:30
WES WATSON Yes, hmm. 

00:04:30
NANCY E. SHERMAN Well, take a look at the form. I think the first thing I want you to understand and just like I said, review is that, it's done in several stages and, of course, these are the same stages that Dr. Allen Ivey uses and then we're adding a few of our own. Uhm, but let's go through some of the stages and the specific skills. I think what we probably wanna do first is take a look at the skills and if you have any questions about any of the skills, we stop, and we just wanna make sure that we're clear with ah, each of those skills. So let's do the first one together. 

00:04:55
WES WATSON Okay. 

00:04:55
SPECIFIC CRITERIA 3. Administrative Tasks 4. Beginning X 

00:04:55
NANCY E. SHERMAN Uhm, you'll notice that the opening stage is developing rapport, and that there are four different skills and that, that pretty basic skills like a greeting... (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:05:05
NANCY E. SHERMAN ...role definition, beginning, any clarification that you need on those skills? 

00:05:10
WES WATSON None. 

00:05:10
NANCY E. SHERMAN Okay. Melissa? 

00:05:10
MELISSA MCCLURE Yeah. 

00:05:10
NANCY E. SHERMAN  All right. Let's go to the second page, please? Second stage is exploration phase or defining the problem that we're using Ivey's microcounseling skills and you'll notice there are 18 different skills. Take a look at those skills. Which of those skills need some clarification? 

00:05:30
B. EXPLORATION PHASE/DEFINING THE PROBLEM MICRO SKILLS 1. Empathy/Rapport 2. Respect 3. Nonverbal Matching X 4. Minimal Encourager X 5. Paraphrasing X 6. Pacing/Leading X 7. Verbal Tracking X 8. Reflect Feeling X 9. Reflect Meaning X 10. Clarifications X 11. Open-ended Questions X 

00:05:30
NANCY E. SHERMAN  I just wanna make sure that everybody's using the skills in the same way. 

00:05:45
MELISSA MCCLURE And number 6, by pacing and leading, uhm, and I would take it that that would be uhm, objectively looked at if it was matching the client's phase. 

00:05:55
NANCY E. SHERMAN Yeah, what you're watching, Melissa, would be the client's behavior or it could be intonation, it could be voice but you wanna be matching the client in some way uhm, knowing that you have built enough rapport with that client before you decide to lead him or her on. 

00:06:05
MELISSA MCCLURE All right, thank you. 

00:06:05
12. Summarization X 13. Behavioral Description X 14. Appropriate Closed Question X 16. Silence X 17. Focusing X 18. Feedback X 

00:06:05
WES WATSON  Number 15 on perception check. There what we're doing is checking to see that what we're seeing in the client is the same thing that he's... (crosstalk) 

00:06:15
NANCY E. SHERMAN Uh hmm. 

00:06:15
WES WATSON ...experiencing, right? 

00:06:15
NANCY E. SHERMAN  It might sound like something like uhm, does that make sense to you or am I, am I on the right track? Those kind of things would be observed with the perception checks. 

00:06:25
WES WATSON Okay, uh hmm. 

00:06:25
NANCY E. SHERMAN  Any other skills in the microcounseling phase. 

00:06:35
MELISSA MCCLURE  None for me. 

00:06:40
DEFINING SKILLS 1. Definition of Goals X 2. Exploration/Understanding Of concerns X 3. Development/Evaluation of Alternatives X 4. Implement Alternative 5. Special Techniques 

00:06:40
NANCY E. SHERMAN All right. Let's move on then. Let's go to the next stage. The problem solving skills stage. Take a look at those. There are six different skills. Of course of those from definition of goals down to special techniques, things like that... (crosstalk) 

00:06:50
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:06:50
NANCY E. SHERMAN ...but clarification on any of those six skills? 

00:06:50
WES WATSON  For special techniques, what kind of things are we looking at that? 

00:07:00
NANCY E. SHERMAN I think, Wes, anything huh, that, any specific technique that might be uhm, a technique that you wanna show us. For example, you might be teaching assertiveness training. You might be teaching stress management. Uhm, you might use Adler's early recollection, both, a specific technique that you will be demonstrating. 

00:07:15
WES WATSON  Okay, uh hmm. 

00:07:20
MELISSA MCCLURE A question on number 6, process counseling, uhm, would that be to stop and hear now and session and talk with the client about what you're seeing it's going on taking place ah, within the session uhm, either? Would that be reflection of the entire session? 

00:07:40
NANCY E. SHERMAN I think it could be uhm, much of what's going on with here now but I'm also looking for things, any kind of patterns that you see emerging things like, oh, you know, loss, grief, any kind of themes that you see emerging... (crosstalk) 

00:07:50
MELISSA MCCLURE Okay. 

00:07:50
NANCY E. SHERMAN ...in the, in the session. 

00:07:50
MELISSA MCCLURE Okay. 

00:07:50
NANCY E. SHERMAN  Let's go on to the next page, please. The action phase, we were actually confronting incongruities. There are six different skills there. 

00:08:00
D. ACTION PHASE/CONFRONTING INCONGRUITIES 1. Immediacy 2. Self-Disclosure 3. Confrontation 4. Directives 5. Logical Consequences 6. Interpretation 

00:08:00
NANCY E. SHERMAN  Questions on any of those skills, anything you need to clarify? 

00:08:05
WES WATSON  That makes sense. 

00:08:10
NANCY E. SHERMAN  Uhm, and the next stage would be closing or generalization. 

00:08:15
E. CLOSING/GENERALIZATION 1. Summarization of Content/Feeling X 2. Review of Plan X 3. Rescheduling 4. Termination of Session 5. Evaluation of Session X 6. Follow-up X 

00:08:15
NANCY E. SHERMAN There are six skills there. Any skills that you need to clarify? 

00:08:20
MELISSA MCCLURE  No. 

00:08:25
WES WATSON No. 

00:08:25
NANCY E. SHERMAN Probably the one that, that I'm hoping that we can see and I'm not sure, Wes, if it's here or not... (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:08:30
NANCY E. SHERMAN ...but the evaluation of session, I'd really like to see an evaluation of, of the session so you can help the client understand uhm, hopefully why he or she got out of it and hopefully what you feel was important as well. 

00:08:40
WES WATSON Okay, Uh hmm. 

00:08:40
NANCY E. SHERMAN And then the last stage is the professionalism stage. There are three skills there from developmental level match down to ethics and professionalism. Questions about those three areas? 

00:08:50
WES WATSON Nope. 

00:08:50
MELISSA MCCLURE No. 

00:08:50
NANCY E. SHERMAN All right. Well, let's go ahead and go through the, the inventory just a little bit so we make sure that we can score it together as well. As you know, you probably remember this form was developed to help us uhm, identify skills for counseling trainees and it's also, if we wanted to, we could quantify your tape. Now, we're not... (crosstalk) 

00:09:10
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:09:10
NANCY E. SHERMAN ...gonna be able to watch the entire tape, Wes, and I think... (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:09:15
NANCY E. SHERMAN ...we could probably watch about 15 minutes of it. But if we were going to watch the entire tape, what we could do is give you an actual score and dependent upon the skills that we see here. Now we're going to use the score using the Ivey Mastery Rating and let me go over those with you. 

00:09:25
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:09:25
NANCY E. SHERMAN If you, if you see a skill, what I'd like you to do first is you mark down in the column that says frequency... 

00:09:35
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:09:35
NANCY E. SHERMAN ...and you just do a tally mark. And so you can continue this through the entire tape and you might have one tally mark, you might have several. But then, what I would like you to do too is, and I think this is extremely helpful, it would be helpful for Wes. Uhm, Melissa, Wes, and I, what we can do is we can write down specific comments we might, like a paraphrase. 

00:09:50
MELISSA MCCLURE Sure. 

00:09:50
NANCY E. SHERMAN That might... (crosstalk) 

00:09:50
WES WATSON Okay. 

00:09:50
NANCY E. SHERMAN ...actually hear you saying or write it down so that I can help you when we're doing supervision. 

00:09:55
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:09:55
NANCY E. SHERMAN Once we go through the entire uhm, form, what I'd like you to do then after it's all over then we can assign some kind of a skill mastery uhm, rating to that and this is the Ivey Mastery Ratings. 

00:10:05
To receive an A on a tape at least 52-58 points must be earned. To receive a B on a tape at least 46-51 points must be earned. To receive a C on a tape at least 41-45 points must be earned. 

00:10:05
NANCY E. SHERMAN Take a look at here. It says, "3, you teach the skill to clients which is teaching mastery only." You're not gonna see a lot of 3s on this because, unless it's specifically teaching a skill... (crosstalk) 

00:10:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:10:15
NANCY E. SHERMAN ...like we talked about assertiveness training where you actively walk the client through a skill. You're probably going to see quite a bit of 2s. You use the skill with specific impact, active mastery. 

00:10:25
WES WATSON  Uh hmm. 

00:10:30
NANCY E. SHERMAN And that the intention behind it was pure too, but not only did you identify the skill but it worked. 

00:10:30
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:10:30
NANCY E. SHERMAN The intention behind was, it had a very good effect on the client. Sometimes we might just, we have a 1, might assign a 1. It says you just identify the counseling skill and that was basic mastery. And then if we were going to use that for quantifying the entire tape, we design the skill mastery rating, we actually give us a score, and then what the score could be, you should see the score in the very back page, here it says the total. We can give you a total score. Now, for us, Wes, we probably won't have a chance to do the entire score. But I still think we can do this. You'll notice that there's an area for strengths and an area for improvement. 

00:11:05
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:11:05
NANCY E. SHERMAN, PH.D. So, I'd really like you to write down the things that you see there, wonderful strengths and the, maybe the areas that we would like to use for supervision in another session. 

00:11:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm, okay. 

00:11:15
NANCY E. SHERMAN What questions do you have about the way we're going to use the inventory or the form? 

00:11:20
WES WATSON  Uhm, it seems to make sense. No questions yet right after that. 

00:11:25
NANCY E. SHERMAN Okay. 

00:11:25
MELISSA MCCLURE It's very clear. 

00:11:25
NANCY E. SHERMAN Okay. Well, let's do this, Wes. I think what I'd like to do is see uh, a portion of your tape. Uhm, it's, it's a portion that you gave to me so I know how to, where to kind of cue it in. But before I do that, ah, we need to know what kind of supervisor questions you might have you'd like us to address during the supervision session. 

00:11:45
WES WATSON Okay, well I think with this particular client, I have a tendency to uhm, do a lot of intellectualizing. (crosstalk) 

00:11:50
NANCY E. SHERMAN Uh hmm. 

00:11:50
Wes Watson M.A., LCPC 

00:11:50
WES WATSON And we get to into cognitive issues, and we do a lot of feeling recognition. But I think moving into the action phase becomes kind of difficult when we do that, so maybe some ideas from you about how to do that better. 

00:12:00
NANCY E. SHERMAN. So, the most important thing we can look for is ways to move the client to a different level. 

00:12:05
WES WATSON Right. 

00:12:05
MELISSA MCCLURE Okay. 

00:12:05
WES WATSON Right. 

00:12:05
NANCY E. SHERMAN We'll watch that. We'll watch for any kind of skills that we see, and then when the tape's over, Wes, ah, we'll do group super, supervision together. 

00:12:15
WES WATSON Okay. 

00:12:15
NANCY E. SHERMAN Sounds good. Let's go ahead and watch the tape, please. 

00:12:15
  Unconditional love and, and unselfishness and... (crosstalk) 

00:12:25
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:12:25
 ...so I sometimes think that, "Well, does that mean I'm selfish and unable to commit and immature," and, you know, these are things that. 

00:12:30
WES WATSON It sounds like part of what, how you get meaning out of life is that you need to be in a relationship. And it sounds like you're struggling with that because you don't necessarily want to be in a relationship, is that? (crosstalk) 

00:12:40
 Yeah. Yeah, I never thought it like that but, yeah, because I, I don't know. I think it's, I think it's okay that, that I'm, you know, a person that needs to be in a relationship to get meaning out of life. I don't know if this is good or not because I've, I've ah, met people that I thought that about. 

00:13:00
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:13:00
 And I don't know if maybe that is, maybe it has been something I've desired to, you know, that it means it does something for me to be... (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:13:10
 ...with you know, somebody that I'm attracted to and I like her already. But now that I'm, the way you rephrased it to me here it's, it's possible that it's something that I don't really get and have the same meaning about... (crosstalk) 

00:13:25
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:13:25
 ...that I haven't passed it on. 

00:13:25
WES WATSON  Uh hmm. I'm wondering if that's something that maybe you got growing up or something that, an idea you have for yourself but that really isn't matching with the way you're look in your life now. 

00:13:35
  Yeah it's, it's a conflict, sort of, because I'm an oldest, the oldest of eight children and grew up in a family where the mom was at home and the dad worked up until, you know, I was in my late teens, anyway. (crosstalk) 

00:13:50
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:13:50
 And uhm, but on the other hand, most of my parents, for most of their marriage, they were not uhm, I don't think they were really happy. 

00:14:00
WES WATSON Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
 And my sisters and my brothers and I talked about what our observations were with our parents. And then... (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
WES WATSON Yeah. 

00:14:05
 ...and they were just some uhm, they were married and later in years, there wasn't like a relationship, you know, I could see couples, you know, like in these commercials for. 

00:14:15
WES WATSON  Physical affection of one another. 

00:14:20
 Yeah, yeah. And they weren't the typical, "We're going to Bahamas, kids," so you know, they weren't, they didn't do that. They were very sedentary. My dad was, was uhm, very uhm, energetic and very ah, like to be out there, (crosstalk) 

00:14:40
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:14:40
 and took us as we're growing up, took us out places, and used to take us downtown Chicago. (crosstalk) 

00:14:40
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:14:40
  And just into that kind of thing. My mother was very, you know, in the home and very loving and very, they both were that way but they were different people, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:14:50
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:14:50
 And I think uhm, my mother has made, ah, had made allusions, or references to that, but that when they met they were young, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:15:00
 19 and 21 years old. And then after that, initial glow of several years they, people change, you know. And I think that, but they stayed married too, back in those days. 

00:15:10
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:15:10
 They didn't divorce at all. And they had eight kids. (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:15:10
 So, you know, people would laugh at me saying this but you can have kids without being, having love, you know what I mean. (crosstalk) 

00:15:20
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:15:20
 It's a matter of sex, you know, sex. 

00:15:20
WES WATSON Uh hmm. So what do you think seeing your parents in that kind of relationship did for your, how you get meaning out of marriage and a relationship. 

00:15:25
  Uhm, it's, it's made me think I don't wanna, I don't want that. I don't want to be with somebody I don't wanna be with... (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:15:35
 ...because I kinda feel like that is uhm, I kinda feel like that's what my Dad felt years passed. (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
WES WATSON He had made his bud(ph) and then fly in it by that I mean to the point that he had, he had made a commitment, now he has to stick with it. 

00:15:50
 Yeah, and he did, and he was a very good father with us uhm, but different than my mother, you know, my mother's, I don't know how to explain it. But he wasn't as uhm, sometimes he was absent, let's put it that way. 

00:16:05
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:16:05
 And he expressed ah, guilt and remorse over that... (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
 ...near the end of his life which, which uhm, like I said happened accidentally, he died accidentally but, uhm. So, my sisters and I and my brothers, we've, we've talked about the, I should say my sisters more than my brothers, and I have two brothers and ah, (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
 and we've talked generally. But my sisters and I have talked about it and, their, their relationship, my parents' relationship, and our observations about it. And we've sort of come to a conclusion that some of who we are and the way we are is because of that. That's... 

00:16:40
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:16:40
 ...and I, I know that to be the case but my sisters' choices of husbands and my choices in relationships and... (crosstalk) 

00:16:45
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:16:45
 ...it's reflected of that. (crosstalk) 

00:16:45
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:16:45
 And I think that ah, my falling out of relationships, so to speak is because of, I guess I sort of have that also just like, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:17:00
WES WATSON So, you can now see a relationship between how you viewed your parents' relationship ah, your divorce, and how are your relationships are now? 

00:17:05
 Yeah, I can see now from my marriage to that, there are certain things about me in the way I, am... (crosstalk) 

00:17:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
 ...that is similar that I've sort of uhm, I saw with my father, you know. 

00:17:20
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:17:20
 And I've talked with the, I talked with Evan's(ph) mother about that. 

00:17:25
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:17:25
 And she also has family traits, too, but I could see there, there are certain uhm, my Dad was very, uhm, you know, a very engaging and a very fun guy. (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:17:35
 But he was, but he's also kinda moody and he uhm, I don't know, he just was a very dynamic type of person. But as far as showing open affection and love uhm, really, I never really saw my parents, you know, hugging or... 

00:17:55
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:17:55
 ...you know, I mean that kind of thing. And maybe I, I sort of, that's the kind of feedback I got during my divorce was. 

00:18:00
WES WATSON  Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:18:05
 That I(ph)... (crosstalk) 

00:18:05
WES WATSON That you were similar to your father and the like. (crosstalk) 

00:18:05
 Yeah, well that, I could see that. Yeah, that I could see that. I was neglecting her needs... (crosstalk) 

00:18:10
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:18:10
 ...and I didn't even know it, you know, I just, (crosstalk) 

00:18:10
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:18:10
 I just was kind of aloof and not even knowing that I was. 

00:18:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:18:15
 So that's, I learned something from divorce. (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:18:20
 But then it's been sort of hard to, even though I know that it's, when it comes to other relationships, I find myself getting in that okay. It's almost like, "Okay, you're here, we're together now. Let's, let's just do whatever," you know... (crosstalk) 

00:18:35
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:18:35
 ...and, and uh, and it, and it appears to some peo, when in that it's uh, like neglecting her... (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:18:40
 ...or you're not paying attention to her or you don't care anymore. 

00:18:45
WES WATSON So your attempts to really alter the way you would react in love and relationships is, is difficult for you. 

00:18:50
 Yeah, I'm a caring, loving, I think, you know, uhm, compassionate person but uhm, I maybe, there's a limit to it,(crosstalk) 

00:19:00
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:19:00
 I don't know if I can go on more than, I don't know if I could give what some people want or expect in a relationship. 

00:19:05
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:19:05
  So, that's why maybe they, then I go a few months and it's really, it gets, it gets old, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:19:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:19:15
 Last two relationships I had with some very good women and uhm, the same thing was reflected to me by... (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:19:25
 ...them at the end of the relationship. And I, I just felt like this is a bunch of bull. I don't wanna hear it anymore. (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
WES WATSON All right. 

00:19:30
 And I, 'coz I felt so crappy about myself, you know, and uh. (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
WES WATSON So you recognized that the relationship pattern, it's happening again. This is the same type. 

00:19:40
 Yeah. 

00:19:40
WES WATSON They're telling you the same thing, you feel bad about the way you react to it. But then you get it back to them. 

00:19:45
 Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:19:45
WES WATSON Do you think that's what's happening? (crosstalk) 

00:19:45
 how do you mean by get it back to them? 

00:19:45
WES WATSON  Well, when you find yourself kinda going through the same pattern again, it makes you upset with yourself... 

00:19:50
 Yeah. 

00:19:50
WES WATSON ... and so you kinda project that on the women? 

00:19:55
 Well, I get defensive. 

00:19:55
WES WATSON Okay. 

00:19:55
 And uh, the thing it's difficult is to hear somebody say something that almost exact same thing that you've heard from another person and. (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
WES WATSON It's not necessarily something that you wanna hear. 

00:20:10
 No, it makes me feel worse because, for instance, somebody's saying but, you know, you're, you're making a mistake and, you know, I'm a good person for you and I'm different. (crosstalk) 

00:20:25
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:20:25
 And, you know, and to be hearing that, and then also hearing like I said this stuff about, you know, you don't seem to be able to do this or you, you know. It's, it's people that are, that are struggling to keep the relationship, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:20:35
  the woman is that I'm talking about. And, and I don't need to say names but that's why I'm just referring to them as a woman. 

00:20:45
WES WATSON Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
 That's, I know it sounds cold... (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
WES WATSON That's right(ph). 

00:20:45
 ...but rather than get real specific but uhm, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
WES WATSON  But you are, would you recognized this pattern that's kinda frustrating for you. 

00:20:55
 Yeah. Yeah. And, and the school and all this, that's gone on the way and my life's going right now is it's a lot of me not to think about it. (laughs) But I still am thinking about it because you don't have to talk to me about it so I can do a lot of rumination. 

00:21:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:21:15
 And I'm, I'm trying to learn to ah, incorporate more of positive self talk in my... 

00:21:20
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:21:20
 ...conversations with myself... 

00:21:20
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:21:20
  which is, and also I uh, am reading. I do and I, I like to, what I call meditating is, is sitting and playing my guitar and looking out my front porch screens and just, (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
 ...just admiring where I'm at. I like where it is. (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
 I like the aesthetics of the neighborhood. And I like the, the feeling of it, that's my meditation, you know. I... 

00:21:45
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:21:45
 ...you know, I kind of just to float back to, sometimes float back to childhood, you know. 

00:21:50
WES WATSON Uh hmm. So those are some of the anxieties going on your life, I mean. Uhm, what went at school and work, the difficulties that you have in relationships. You're able to do some things and sit down and relax, and things that stress out that one. (crosstalk) 

00:22:00
  Uh hmm. 

00:22:05
WES WATSON So, you've got something that would conquer that. That's what's important. (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
 Yeah. These uh, last two summers to have enrolled at rollerblading... (crosstalk) 

00:22:10
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:22:10
 ...that's, I really enjoyed that, I'm not... (crosstalk) 

00:22:10
WES WATSON But this brought you something? 

00:22:10
 Yeah. I definitely like physical exercises. And I'm not really a runner. (crosstalk) 

00:22:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:22:15
 But this sort of is like that but it's not. 

00:22:20
WES WATSON Kinda, kinda. 

00:22:20
 Yeah, and you can just really book(ph) in there... 

00:22:20
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:22:20
 ...to go, I like doing that and there's track in West Peoria outside, you know, asphalt track at the Franciscan Center. And... (crosstalk) 

00:22:30
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:22:30
 ...that's what I do, you know. Bike, ride a lot, and I ride to school everyday when, I mean for classes. (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:22:35
 And uh, it takes me two minutes probably... (crosstalk) 

00:22:40
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:22:40
 ...to ride from my house to here. (crosstalk) 

00:22:40
WES WATSON Yes, yeah. 

00:22:40
 In the wintertime, I'll have to walk or hitch a ride or something. But, I'm very, I'm very nearby here. So, (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:22:45
 soo yeah, I've been doing things to, to uhm, relieve myself of the anxiety and stress and... (crosstalk) 

00:22:50
WES WATSON  Uh hmm. 

00:22:55
 And ah, you know that I'm not in a relationship and I don't have a sexual... 

00:23:00
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:23:00
 ...sort of release, you know, I mean with a partner I mean. 

00:23:00
WES WATSON Uh hmm. So, it's nice to be while you do something physical. 

00:23:05
 Oh yeah, definitely. It's uh, definitely part of keeping your whole total being, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:23:10
  In fact, we did a paper on that the other day on the wellness and mental health.(crosstalk) 

00:23:15
WES WATSON At the Hall? 

00:23:15
 Yes. 

00:23:15
WES WATSON  Was that a good experience for you? 

00:23:20
 It was pretty good, yeah. It reminded me of a wellness spiel that I used to in some presentations over the last few years that... 

00:23:25
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:23:25
 uhm, allows kids to kind of highlight areas, the five areas of their whole being... (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:23:35
 ...that uhm, that needed, it helps them to see which areas need, they are neglecting and need to work on. (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
 So mine would be probably my diet if I could eat better. (crosstalk) 

00:23:45
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:23:45
  And when winter comes along that would be more uhm, more sedentary. (crosstalk) 

00:23:50
WES WATSON  Uh-huh. 

00:23:55
 And the winter time is, is, it gets stressful because you're sedentary but you're, you know, doing all your life things and so I don't. (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
WES WATSON Yeah, It sounds like you're very cognitive of, of that wheel in, in keeping things in balance. 

00:24:05
 Oh, yeah. My ah, spiritual life is uhm, connected to the church I go to, I mean that's how I, I uh, satisfy that. (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
WES WATSON  Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
 And I have some good friends who are of the same sort of mind... (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
 ...and perspective on things of the spiritual nature. Ah, it's been really, that's sort of become my uh, social, my social life, too. (crosstalk) 

00:24:30
WES WATSON  Uh hmm. 

00:24:35
 And uh, so do, what else haven't I talked to you about? You know, all about my sex life, my school life, my family life, uhm. 

00:24:50
WES WATSON It seems like we've put(ph) a lot of places today. 

00:24:50
 Yeah. 

00:24:50
WES WATSON And so if we could just sum up a little bit. 

00:24:50
  But I needed to. I mean I've, I wanted to do this and felt comfortable talking about this. 

00:24:55
WES WATSON So it feels pretty, like... (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
PATIENT Yeah. 

00:25:00
WES WATSON ...it's been pretty helpful for you. (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
PATIENT Yeah. 

00:25:00
WES WATSON Okay, good. Let me just do a little review and see uhm, make sure I understand where you're coming from. 

00:25:05
PATIENT Okay. 

00:25:05
WES WATSON Uhm, originally, we started talking about some of your anxiety levels uhm, especially, especially dealing with uhm, the loss of a job that you had had for several years and kind of thrust into a graduate school uhm, that you wanted to do but it kinda forced your hand. (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
PATIENT Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
WES WATSON Uhm, you've been getting some extra jobs on the side, (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
PATIENT Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
WES WATSON  more a little bit about over committing yourself. So you're trying to watch that. We talked a little bit about relationships and how there seems to be some patterns into the relationships you have that only lasts for a few months. (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
PATIENT Uh hmm. 

00:25:35
WES WATSON At that time and then they kinda, you kinda get wary of that commitment and the time involvement in those and, and that frustrates you a little bit. Uhm, but also at this point in your life you've got so many things going on, you don't feel the need for a, a long term commitment relationship. (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
PATIENT Yeah. 

00:25:50
WES WATSON So you're kinda in between for awhile. (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
PATIENT Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
WES WATSON We looked at your parents' relationship and how that may have laid, laid the stage for how you relate with women. (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
PATIENT Uh hmm. 

00:25:55
WES WATSON And that's something that you think a lot about. (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
PATIENT  Uh hmm. 

00:26:00
WES WATSON And then we came around talked about the wellness we know, how you, like to keep things in perspective and keep a balance in your life with what you've do physically. To be able to relax and has have some perfect skills and then you got that back in line again to the anxiety that... (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
PATIENT Yeah. 

00:26:10
WES WATSON ...helps you deal with that. 

00:26:10
PATIENT Yeah, that's very good. 

00:26:15
WES WATSON Okay, thanks very much. 

00:26:15
PATIENT Thank you. 

00:26:15
WES WATSON (inaudible ) 

00:26:18
PATIENT (inaudible ) 

00:26:19
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Counseling interview rating form first but remember Wes's supervisor question. And Wes, as I remember it, you really want us to feel as we look at these skills, how can we help you move more into an action phase. 

00:26:30
WES WATSON Right, right. (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN All right. Well the very first stage we, we did not see because we didn't see the beginning of the tape. But let's move to the second stage which is the exploration phase and that, let's talk about what skills you actually saw Wes demonstrating as far as microcounseling skills. 

00:26:45
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:26:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Melissa, how about for you? What did you see skill doing, Wes doing? 

00:26:50
Melissa McClure, NCC 

00:26:50
MELISSA MCCLURE Well, I saw him actually covering uhm, most of the skills of one through 18. Uhm, I did not, the only thing I did not, I think it would be easier for me to address what... (crosstalk) 

00:27:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay, that'd be fine. 

00:27:00
MELISSA MCCLURE ...he did, I did not see. I did not see ah, a behavioral description. Uhm. 

00:27:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I didn't either. Wes, did... (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
WES WATSON Yeah. 

00:27:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...you see yourself do a behavioral... (crosstalk) 

00:27:10
WES WATSON No, (crosstalk) 

00:27:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...description? 

00:27:10
WES WATSON no, I didn't. 

00:27:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay. I did a circle of that and we kinda talk about that something... (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:27:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...that might address some of your questions about action... (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:27:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...issues. 

00:27:15
WES WATSON Sure. 

00:27:15
MELISSA MCCLURE  An, and I'm not sure so, well, I did see some feedback, but some of the feedback he gave, also kind of crossed over in some other areas... (crosstalk) 

00:27:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:27:25
MELISSA MCCLURE ...uhm, so. (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN As long as you're bringing up a good point though so you could put some of these marks in several categories. (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
MELISSA MCCLURE Very much so, (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Okay. Fine. (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
MELISSA MCCLURE very much so. 

00:27:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay. Uhm, I, I, I thought I saw feedback but I did not see, Wes, I didn't see you doing nonverbal matching. (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
WES WATSON I don't, uh hmm. 

00:27:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Were you doing any nonverbal matching that you could think of? 

00:27:45
WES WATSON You know, now that you mention it, I didn't see that. 

00:27:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Okay. 

00:27:50
WES WATSON I didn't see that as much. 

00:27:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uhm, perhaps there were some matching with voice but I didn't see nonverbally. So... (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:27:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...that might be another area... (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:27:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...that we could circle... (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
WES WATSON Okay. 

00:27:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...in and talk about. But basically we saw, and Wes, would you agree with Melissa and me, we saw lots of microcounseling skills. When you looked at your tallies, did you see? (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
WES WATSON Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Quite a few? (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
WES WATSON Yes, yes. (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay. And remember the purpose of microcounseling skills is to let the client know "I'm interested, I want you to continue on" so there was much rapport building happening in that stage. 

00:28:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:28:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN That's great. Let's move down to the, the next stage, the problem solving skills stage or defining skills stage. There are six different skills. Uhm, what skills did you see being demonstrated? 

00:28:25
WES WATSON  I saw a lot of exploration, (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:28:30
WES WATSON understanding, concerns, I saw it a lot. (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm, (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
MELISSA MCCLURE Yeah. 

00:28:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:28:30
WES WATSON  Uhm, I don't know that we really talked about goal definition. (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. That's, (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
WES WATSON I don't think we got into it. 

00:28:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  that's the piece I saw missing... (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:28:40
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:28:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...too, Wes, (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
WES WATSON Right. 

00:28:40
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:28:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN and I think again if we concentrate on the action which you said that I wanna know how to move... (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:28:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...myself into action that might help us get there. (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
WES WATSON All right. 

00:28:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN So, I might circle that and kinda keep this. It'll help, help us too. I saw uhm, development and evaluation of alternatives when you were talking to your client about what, what do you do and he says, "Well, I like to rollerblade, (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  I like to read. (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:29:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN There are so many, I like my house." (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:29:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I saw some things there. (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:29:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uhm, anybody see implementation of alternatives? 

00:29:05
MELISSA MCCLURE No, I didn't see that but I did think, (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
MELISSA MCCLURE you know, when you're talking about it I asked for clarification early on about number six... (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm, (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
MELISSA MCCLURE ...but I did see, (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  process counseling? 

00:29:15
MELISSA MCCLURE I did see him kinda returning to the theme of the patterns. (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:29:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:29:15
MELISSA MCCLURE So I did see what I saw. (crosstalk) 

00:29:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay. 

00:29:20
MELISSA MCCLURE All through that. 

00:29:20
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:29:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh here's my question, Wes, to you though, I wrote down implementation of alternatives when you, when you took your client into the wellness wheel. (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I thought you were trying to get him to say, "I need you to really focus on wellness so that you can continue to help yourself with anxiety." I didn't know if anybody else saw that but that, I did mark down something for implementation... (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
MELISSA MCCLURE Hmm. Okay. 

00:29:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...of alternatives. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
WES WATSON  Right, right. 

00:29:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Let's go to the next stage, please, the action stage. This is the stage, Wes, that you said I could use some help in. (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:29:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN What skills did you see being demonstrated? 

00:29:50
WES WATSON He's doing interpreting. 

00:29:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  That's the skill I saw. (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm, uh hmm, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
WES WATSON I saw a lot of that. I didn't see any directives. (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
MELISSA MCCLURE  Uh hmm. 

00:30:00
WES WATSON Uhm, I wasn't using any logical con, consequences. (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:30:00
WES WATSON I didn't see confrontation... (crosstalk) 

00:30:05
MELISSA MCCLURE Yeah. 

00:30:05
WES WATSON ...or self-disclosure. (crosstalk) 

00:30:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:30:05
WES WATSON Uhm, I think it was fairly immediate with him. (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:30:10
WES WATSON But, those are, those are the two I saw mostly. (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay, ah, I saw the interpretation when you were talking about things... (crosstalk) 

00:30:15
WES WATSON Hmm. 

00:30:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...that might be some correlation between his past and his dad, and how he views relationships now. (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:30:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uhm, the confrontation I didn't see and again when we talk about action, I think we can, we can move you right into confrontation. (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:30:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Were there some discrepancies that your client actually gave you... (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:30:30
WES WATSON ...and I think there were and we'll talk about that. (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:30:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I think we'll talk about that, Wes. (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
WES WATSON Okay. 

00:30:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Ah, let's keep going down the stages though. The, the next stage is your closing or generalization stage. (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:30:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN What skills did you see demonstrated here? 

00:30:40
WES WATSON I was doing some, some summarization... (crosstalk) 

00:30:45
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:30:45
WES WATSON ...of content feeling there with, at the end there, kind of summing up what we explored in the session uhm, and, and then at the same time checking with him. (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:30:50
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:30:50
WES WATSON Uhm, we didn't review a plan. We talked about rescheduling. (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:30:55
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:30:55
WES WATSON Uhm, I think what I was doing the summarization, part of that was an evaluation but I don't, (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yes. 

00:31:05
WES WATSON I don't know that that was clear... (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:31:05
WES WATSON ...to the client. 

00:31:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well and I think if we keep focused on action, I would think that if we can uhm, bring out your evaluation of the session, Wes, it's gonna be very, very helpful. (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:31:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I put a down as a skill that I saw because you, you, your, your client said to you, "This has been so helpful. (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:31:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I'm so glad that I came to talk to you about all these things." (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:31:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And you, you even paraphrased back. So, you felt that this was helpful and so you were evaluating to some degree, so I did see evaluation of the session. (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
MELISSA MCCLURE And actually the client evaluated the session because he said... (crosstalk) 

00:31:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:31:35
MELISSA MCCLURE ...he went over the topics that had been covered and how... (crosstalk) 

00:31:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:31:35
MELISSA MCCLURE ...much he'd actually revealed. (crosstalk) 

00:31:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  And how helpful it was to him so we... (crosstalk) 

00:31:40
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:31:40
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:31:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...know that this was a beneficial uhm, session to him. 

00:31:40
WES WATSON  Okay. 

00:31:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN What about the last one? This is the stage called professionalism. There are three components, developmental level match, ethics, and professionalism. What skills did you see, Wes demonstrating? 

00:31:55
WES WATSON You know, developmentally I think we were pretty much in the same area. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:32:00
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:32:00
WES WATSON he was obviously above concrete... (crosstalk) 

00:32:00
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:32:00
WES WATSON ...uhm, into some, some abstract thinking and I think... (crosstalk) 

00:32:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
WES WATSON ...we were both there. Uhm, I think professionally uhm, I think I looked... (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
WES WATSON ...comfortable as did he. (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
WES WATSON Uhm, so, I don't think there was a problem. Ethically, I don't know that we got into any ethical issues (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Issues, uh hmm. 

00:32:20
WES WATSON ...uhm, necessarily. (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. Well, Wes, I like what you said about developmental level match, too, because I think about, when we talk about deve, developmental level match, you're looking for, you know, "What is the developmental level of my client" and... (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
WES WATSON Hmm. 

00:32:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ..."is my client in crisis." If he's in cri, crisis, you know a D-1 that I matched that. (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN But your client wasn't in crisis and I felt your interventions were very appropriate. (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:32:40
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:32:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN They were giving him more paraphrasing, more nondirective kind of uhm, statements, and so I think it was very, very appropriate. (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Anything else, Melissa, that, that you saw? 

00:32:50
MELISSA MCCLURE No, I think you guys covered all the professional qualities. (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay, okay. Let's go to the very last page then, please. 

00:33:00
WES WATSON Okay. 

00:33:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And honestly we're now getting into, Wes ah, more of your supervisory question of the action phase. (crosstalk) 

00:33:05
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:33:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN But let's talk a little bit about your strengths and then we'll move into areas for improvement. Wes, how about you? Let's, let's start with you first. What, what are the strengths that you saw in this segment of the tape? 

00:33:15
WES WATSON I think uhm, there was a good rapport between the client and I. (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:33:20
WES WATSON You could tell that he was very comfortable speaking with me. (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:33:20
WES WATSON Uhm, and I, I didn't have to fight to pull up anything from him. (crosstalk) 

00:33:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:33:25
WES WATSON He just opened up. And I think that was very nice. 

00:33:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  And I think the rapport came also because you used so many beautiful microcounseling skills. (crosstalk) 

00:33:30
MELISSA MCCLURE Yes. 

00:33:30
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:33:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I mean the client knew the intention behind all those skills. He knew you were listening and that you wanted him to continue on. 

00:33:40
WES WATSON Right, right. (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN It was done very nicely. 

00:33:40
MELISSA MCCLURE That's really one of the points that I saw was your focus as well as your paraphrasing were of, of big strength that you had. You had an ability in the session I saw the uhm, to listen to the client, you know, what he'd said and when you paraphrased it you're sort of, you know, willed it down the crux of the matter. (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:34:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:34:00
MELISSA MCCLURE When you weren't very verbose, so that was good. (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
WES WATSON Uh hmm. Thank you. 

00:34:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And you, the reflections of meaning. I mean you really, (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:34:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN when you talk about Karkoff(ph) levels, you know, you really... (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:34:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...took of too much deeper level and I think that was helpful to the client as well. 

00:34:10
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:34:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Wes, what about uhm, areas of, for improvement and then we'll specifically zone in on the moving into action phase. What was in areas of improvement as you watched yourself? 

00:34:20
WES WATSON As I was watching the videotape uhm, some of the things I, it seemed like I missed some opportunities... (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
MELISSA MCCLURE  Uh hmm. 

00:34:30
WES WATSON ...there. And that's the thing. Uhm, I have a tendency to be a little bit existential in my counseling so the meaning part is really important to me... (crosstalk) 

00:34:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:34:35
WES WATSON ...and that's something that I like... (crosstalk) 

00:34:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:34:35
WES WATSON ...to share with clients. And when I do that I think I missed some of the ah, some of the hooks, the possibilities... (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:34:40
WES WATSON  of places to go into that action phase. (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:34:45
WES WATSON And that's one of the things that I've been struggling with. (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. So although existentialism is important to you and it was obvious that, that it, that it matched this client. (crosstalk) 

00:34:50
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:34:50
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:34:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN But you're saying that also makes the possibility that you could miss some things. 

00:34:55
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:34:55
WES WATSON Right, right. (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay. I, I wrote down to, Wes. Uhm, I always talk, you know, to the students a lot about one-liners. Let's look for the one-liners... (crosstalk) 

00:35:05
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:35:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...in the counseling tape... (crosstalk) 

00:35:05
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:35:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...and your client gave you a really nice one-liner when he said, you know, and this is just an example, "Sometimes my Dad is, was absent." 

00:35:10
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:35:10
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:35:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Do you remember your response, Wes? 

00:35:10
WES WATSON  No, I don't. 

00:35:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay, you were quiet. You were silent which I thought was... (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:35:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...quite appropriate. (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:35:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  But then the very next, there was, there was a few seconds of silence and then you said, to see if I can do a paraphrase uhm, "So you do see a relationship between your parents' marriage and your relationships now?" (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
WES WATSON  Uh hmm. 

00:35:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Which was powerful reflection... (crosstalk) 

00:35:30
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:35:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...of meaning. (crosstalk) 

00:35:30
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:35:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN But again I think that you could've zoomed it on just that one-liner which was sometimes my Dad is absent. (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:35:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Let's do it together as a team real quickly. Uhm, if we zoom on, in on the one-liner and you kept verbal tracking with that one-liner, what kind of things might you say and now we're kinda moving into action phase again. 

00:35:50
WES WATSON Right, right. (crosstalk) 

00:35:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN What do you think you, just brainstorm with me, what could you say? 

00:35:50
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:35:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Think verbal tracking. 

00:35:55
WES WATSON Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
MELISSA MCCLURE I'm not sure where in the session that this would be appropriate but uhm, I was thinking along the same lines since that the, the client was staying cognitive... (crosstalk) 

00:36:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:36:05
MELISSA MCCLURE ...and wasn't sure that he had stayed cognitive. And so that, that's a match is good and it also could have it's pitfall. (crosstalk) 

00:36:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay. 

00:36:10
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:36:10
MELISSA MCCLURE And so when the client was saying his father was absent uhm, it seems to me that, you know, you could've gone to how that had made him feel... (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah, (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
MELISSA MCCLURE ...and how that plays out in the relationships... (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:36:20
MELISSA MCCLURE ...that he has been talking to you about in the session. (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:36:25
WES WATSON Right, absolutely that makes a lot of sense. 

00:36:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN So, Melissa, you're saying to, maybe get him in the feeling by using a reflection of feeling? 

00:36:30
MELISSA MCCLURE Exactly. 

00:36:30
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:36:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Because I saw more reflections of meaning, Wes, than I saw reflections of feeling. (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:36:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And I think you could've taken it... (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:36:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...to a different level. I also thought about moving into action phase if you continue to verbal track and you look at the same theme, you could even ask, focus on the, the client and ask the question, "Are you absent now as well in your own relationships?" (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
MELISSA MCCLURE Exactly(ph). 

00:36:50
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:36:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Bring that back to your client... (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
WES WATSON Yeah. 

00:36:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  and I'm wondering if that would've taken... (crosstalk) 

00:36:55
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:36:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...you to a different stage. We talked about uhm, incongruity, that you didn't do much confrontation. (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN It was a beautiful time... (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...to, to maybe talk about some discrepancies. And your client talked a little bit about being defensive. (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:37:05
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  "I get defensive" and so you could've really worked on that I think as well. 

00:37:10
WES WATSON Right. 

00:37:10
MELISSA MCCLURE And I think you could've move into uhm, the actions. I think, I thought that I did see it actually maybe on an unconscious level, I thought I did see a confrontation when he mentioned the word projection... (crosstalk) 

00:37:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:37:20
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:20
MELISSA MCCLURE ...onto his other relationships but your client sort of responded to that. (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:37:25
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:25
MELISSA MCCLURE Uhm, he cleared his throat, (clear throat) (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
WES WATSON  Uh hmm. 

00:37:30
MELISSA MCCLURE you know like that and uhm, it seemed like he got a little, just a little more fidgety. (crosstalk) 

00:37:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:37:30
MELISSA MCCLURE And I think right then, you know, you could've, you could've gone to how he was feeling in here now with that comment. (crosstalk) 

00:37:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:37:35
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:35
MELISSA MCCLURE And I think that stirred up anything up in him because I think, I thought I saw a reaction from him. (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:37:40
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:40
MELISSA MCCLURE And I think that could've moved you into a deeper level as well. 

00:37:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN If you saw a reaction then, Wes here's the action phase again though. You could take so, the behavioral description from the microcounseling skills. (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:37:50
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And behavior you described, I noticed when I did this you know, you kinda moved away, you cleared your throat, (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN what's that about? 

00:38:00
WES WATSON Absolutely. (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN That would get him into process counseling. That would get him... (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:38:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...into some action phases. (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
WES WATSON  Uh hmm. 

00:38:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And I think so using behavioral descriptions would be something that would be very powerful. 

00:38:05
WES WATSON Hmm, I can see that. (crosstalk) 

00:38:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN It's not an easy skill to use but I, I think it would be really helpful to you. Other things that maybe would help you, Wes, take your client to a different level. 

00:38:20
[sil.] 

00:38:20
WES WATSON  Looking back on the, on the session I do see some things that I missed where I could've went into some feeling things. (crosstalk) 

00:38:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:38:25
WES WATSON  I think that was very powerful. 

00:38:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN That's great. Well, let's stay there for a second. 

00:38:30
WES WATSON Okay. 

00:38:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uhm, if we talk about process counseling, we talk about feeling, (crosstalk) 

00:38:35
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:38:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN we talk about themes, what's ah, a feeling that this client might be having. I'm just kinda guessing, but what's the feeling... (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
WES WATSON Hmm. 

00:38:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...this client might be having? 

00:38:45
WES WATSON I think there's some aloneness there. 

00:38:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah, I think... (crosstalk) 

00:38:50
MELISSA MCCLURE Hmm. 

00:38:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...he's feeling very lonely. (crosstalk) 

00:38:50
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:38:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Go deeper behind, what's behind loneliness? Just guess with this. 

00:38:55
WES WATSON  Maybe some more anxiety and fears. (crosstalk) 

00:39:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Anxiety, (crosstalk) 

00:39:00
MELISSA MCCLURE Hmm. 

00:39:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN that's it, Wes, (crosstalk) 

00:39:00
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:39:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN that's it. It's the, it's the fear. (crosstalk) 

00:39:00
WES WATSON Okay. 

00:39:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  I think there's, you wanna take him further, I think I would go into the fear. (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
WES WATSON Hmm. 

00:39:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN What are you afraid of, and now we're taking the client to a whole different level to a whole different action phase. 

00:39:10
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:39:10
WES WATSON Right. 

00:39:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I think that would be beautiful. 

00:39:10
MELISSA MCCLURE  And I think when you, one of the tools that you can use if you were seeing his kind of game would've been his own uhm, focus on the balance in his life. (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:39:20
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:39:20
MELISSA MCCLURE You know, uhm, you know that a balance can be uhm, an attainment for something that you want. But it also can be a way to avoid it. Is he see looking for a balance or to keep a balance that he's already maintained... (crosstalk) 

00:39:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:39:30
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:39:30
MELISSA MCCLURE ...but is no longer working for him. 

00:39:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:39:35
WES WATSON That's a good point. 

00:39:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN So maybe even though he feels like he's pretty comfortable... (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:39:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...maybe get into that just a little bit more. (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. And, and for you, you were talking about how you used to like to be existential. (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
MELISSA MCCLURE And there's a balance there... (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
MELISSA MCCLURE ...for you as well, and that you know, you can focus in on the meaning for yourself but the meaning is sort of hollow without... (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:39:50
MELISSA MCCLURE  the, you know, empathy... (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:39:55
MELISSA MCCLURE ...and the feelings that go behind it. 

00:39:55
WES WATSON Right, absolutely. 

00:39:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. Well, let's, let's put some closure in all this. Uhm, as we are using the counseling interview rating form, I think, Wes, what I'd like to know is from you uhm, based on everything we've talked about today, I guess I'd, I'd like you to answer the question, what will you take from this using this form and from our discussion, what will you take from our supervision that will help you move the client to a little bit different level? 

00:40:15
WES WATSON Well, I think it's been very helpful looking at some of the, missed opportunities, the one-liners... (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:40:20
WES WATSON ...as you called them in the session. Uhm, some of the places that I could've taken the client uhm, I like the idea of using the behavioral descriptions. (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Uh hmm. 

00:40:30
WES WATSON Uhm, for example, when he cleared his throat when I mentioned something that was maybe uncomfortable for him, and not necessarily catching that right away. (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:40:35
WES WATSON Uhm, that's a good place to go. Also focusing on the feelings that are behind the meanings, I think is very important. (crosstalk) 

00:40:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:40:40
WES WATSON Something that I probably haven't been paying enough attention to it so. So I think this has been very helpful. 

00:40:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Good, okay. Melissa, anything that you wanna add to this, this po, portion? 

00:40:50
MELISSA MCCLURE Ah, I think I'd like just to add that you did a lot of things right as well. (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:40:55
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:40:55
MELISSA MCCLURE And I'm glad that this could be helpful in pointing out some ways that you can further your counseling skills. 

00:41:00
WES WATSON Thank you. 

00:41:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Ah, Wes, I'd like to I would say the same thing and I think what I would tell you to do. Melissa and I will give you our forms. (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And what I'd like you to do with them is to take a look at the, the frequence, the tallies that we looked, that we marked because they're so many of them. (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:41:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN But then I would take a look at the voids. Look at the ones that we circled that we didn't see. 

00:41:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:41:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  And see if that will help you continue to move into that action phase because I'm with Melissa. I think that there's some beautiful examples of microcounseling skills being demonstrated. 

00:41:25
WES WATSON Okay. 

00:41:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And again, remember what your client said. He said, "Oh, I feel so much better, you know, I, I loved to talking with you," and I think that's just really important. (crosstalk) 

00:41:35
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:41:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Let's, let's move to just maybe a little bit different level. Uhm, we've done supervision using the form and I guess... (crosstalk) 

00:41:40
WES WATSON Hmm. 

00:41:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...the twist I'd like to do is to ask the two of you, from a counseling training perspective ah, what are the advantages of using a form like this, the counseling interview rating form, what are the advantages? 

00:41:50
WES WATSON I can see a lot of things in the, in the form itself that really uhm, highlights important factors and counseling. (crosstalk) 

00:41:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:41:55
WES WATSON  There are a lot of things within the form uhm, that are very important and are key to successful counseling. (crosstalk) 

00:42:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:42:00
WES WATSON  And I think it points some right out. Uhm, I like the ideas of the Xs along the side, too, that help point out the mastery levels. (crosstalk) 

00:42:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:42:10
WES WATSON I think that's very nice. 

00:42:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And so there's couple of things, what you're saying is that it helps you maybe identify skills, (crosstalk) 

00:42:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:42:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN helps you understand ah, kind of a flow, and then the Xs that ah, that we put in there uhm, are really, don't have anything to do with theoretical orientation. They are just skills... (crosstalk) 

00:42:25
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:42:25
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:42:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...that we think we should be showing every single time when you, when you see a client. And that I think would help maybe identify uhm, a flow of a counseling session as well. (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:42:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Melissa, how about for you? You've used the form a lot. 

00:42:35
MELISSA MCCLURE Well I, I think for me what's been really helpful was using form over time. You can really see, you know, patterns developing. (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:42:40
MELISSA MCCLURE  And like Lori was saying that, you know, what you're missing if you continue on this that if you can see... (crosstalk) 

00:42:45
WES WATSON Hmm. 

00:42:45
MELISSA MCCLURE ...also the increasing on, on that skill. And that's helpful to know, you know, to know what progress you may or may not be making. (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:42:55
MELISSA MCCLURE And it's also helpful in the form, it's got two different ways of giving you feedback. I mean one of them is sort of a score, you know, a tally... (crosstalk) 

00:43:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:43:00
MELISSA MCCLURE ...which is giving you numbers and there are some comments. (crosstalk) 

00:43:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:43:05
MELISSA MCCLURE But what I really like also is the piece in the back and that you're able to sit with people, with your peers, and sit with them and you get some more verbal and more specific feedback at the end, and it doesn't just cover what you're not doing well. (crosstalk) 

00:43:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:43:15
MELISSA MCCLURE It covers what you're doing well. (crosstalk) 

00:43:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:43:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN That is nice. (crosstalk) 

00:43:15
WES WATSON Uh hmm. Yes. 

00:43:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN We, you may, made me think of something, Melissa, that we've talked though. If we'd seen the entire tape... (crosstalk) 

00:43:20
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. 

00:43:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...and we'd actually tallied up all our skill mastery ratings and, and gave you a grade, what I think is real fun, too, is to often figure out from the student's perspective, does my quantitative score match... (crosstalk) 

00:43:35
MELISSA MCCLURE (inaudible ) Uh hmm. 

00:43:36
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:43:36
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...qualitatively how I feel. And I guess, Wes, I'm putting on a spot here but based on what you've, you've watched and what you've scored so far, what would you give yourself as far as a grade? 

00:43:40
WES WATSON  Well, you're putting me on the spot. (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I am putting you on the spot. 

00:43:45
WES WATSON I think I won't have to go with at least a high B or a level A. (crosstalk) 

00:43:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:43:50
WES WATSON I thought it was a successful session. Uh hmm. 

00:43:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm, yeah. And we, and we don't have end, to the qu, question because we couldn't tally him up but... (crosstalk) 

00:43:55
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:43:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...I think so, too, I think that the, the high B is where I'd put it Wes, too, (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:44:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN because uhm, you said it was successful. There was great outcome... (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
MELISSA MCCLURE Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:44:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...with this client. Ah, and, I think to, to really make it an A tape, all you wanna do is focus more on those action stages and it would really be helpful. (crosstalk) 

00:44:10
WES WATSON Uh hmm. 

00:44:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And you need to be more intentional. You know, Dr. Ivey talks about the decision-making model more, the intentionality, I think it'd be more intentional the more effective. 

00:44:20
WES WATSON Right. 

00:44:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN That will be great. Melissa and Wes, I really appreciate your uhm, allowing us to do this today. And, Wes, I, I very much appreciate your effort you put into the tape... (crosstalk) 

00:44:30
WES WATSON Yeah. 

00:44:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ... and letting us do live supervision on tape, I guess, with you. So thank you so much. 

00:44:30
WES WATSON  You're welcome. (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
MELISSA MCCLURE Thank you. 

00:44:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Thanks, Melissa. 

00:44:35
MELISSA MCCLURE You're welcome. Thank you.

NANCY E. SHERMAN, PH.D.  Although originally designed to be used for evaluating the counseling session, the counseling interview rating form can also provide a detailed format for peer supervision and evaluation. In peer supervision, the trainee presents a videotaped session and peers give feedback using the form. The structured format provides feedback that is consistent and focused which is especially helpful for the inexperienced peer supervisor and observer. In addition, to use as an evaluation tool, the counseling interview rating form is an excellent teaching tool. In beginning skill development classes as students view videotapes of each other's work, they're asked to use the counseling interview rating form to identify the specific skills being used. Trainees learn to identify skills in each stage and the focus can shift from skills in each stage. Students might also be assigned to observe the work of the counselor in the field, and the counseling interview rating form can provide a structure for that observation. To summarize, the counseling interview rating form can be useful in counselor education because it teaches how to classify specific skills and behaviors and evaluate them. It also provides a vocabulary for naming what is occurring in the interview. This form also makes it possible for the student and/or professional to classify his or her behavior in the interview and to examine the intentions of each behavior and the impact the skill had on the client. And finally, the counseling interview rating form provides a format for examining whether the goals of each interview stage were achieved.
