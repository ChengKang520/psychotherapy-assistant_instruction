00:00:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS Hello. My name is Dr. Manivong J. Ratts, and I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Counseling and School of Psychology at Seattle University. Today what you're going to be doing is watching a video series titled "Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy." We're going to be going over the major theoretical paradigms, if you will, or forces that have really shaped how counseling is practiced with clients. We're going to look at the first force, which is the psychoanalytic tradition, the second force which is also referred to as the cognitive/behavioral tradition in counseling and psychotherapy. Then we'll highlight and provide an overview of the third force in counseling, which is the existential/humanistic perspective in counseling and psychology. Then we'll look at the fourth force in counseling, which is referred to as the multicultural paradigm in the field, and then last but not least, we'll examine and look at social justice as the fifth force in counseling and psychotherapy. Within each of these particular theories or paradigms or forces, if you will, I'll be interviewing experts in the field. Each of these experts will be sharing and talking about their current research within that particular paradigm, as well as some of the major tenets of the particular force that they are specializing in, in the particular field. So I'll be interviewing a psychoanalytic scholar. I'll be interviewing a CBT scholar, existential scholar, multicultural-oriented scholar and then last but not least, a social justice oriented scholar, who've really helped shape each of those particular forces and made them what they are today. Following each of those particular interviews, what you'll see if a series of therapy sessions with the same client. The client will be working with five different therapists. Each therapist will be operating from a particular tradition paradigm or force, if you will. The first therapist will be operating from a psychoanalytic tradition. The second therapist will be working from a CBT perspective, cognitive/behavioral orientation. The third therapist will be operating from a existential/humanistic perspective in counseling. The fourth therapist will be working froma multicultural-oriented perspective, and then the last but not least, we have a demonstration of a therapist working from a social justice-oriented perspective. My hope is that by watching each of these particular videos or interviews, if you will, as well as each of these particular counseling sessions, it really highlight and provide you with some of the strengths and weaknesses of each particular counseling force that have really shaped how counseling is practiced to this day. Today what you're going to be doing is watching part of a larger video segment titled "Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy." For this particular video segment, you're going to be watching and what we're going to be doing is focusing on the second force in counseling and psychotherapy, which is the cognitive/behavioral tradition in the field. We're going to begin this particular video by showing you an interview that I conduct with Dr. Sam Song who is an Associate Professor at Seattle University. He's also an expert in CBT who's done a lot of research in the cognitive/behavioral tradition and he's going to be talking about the major historical perspectives of CBT, some of the major tenets of CBT and also highlight some of the major research that's happening right now that is having a significant impact on the cognitive/behavioral tradition. Following my interview with Dr. Song, what you will be doing is watching a live video or live counseling session with a particular client. The therapist that's going to work with this client is Dr. Katherine Nordell Fort, who is a counselor at Bellevue College, and what she'll be doing is demonstrating how to operationalize CBT in a clinical setting. Again, this particular video series is part of a larger video series titled "Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy" where we compare and contrast the major forces in the field that have really shaped counseling as we know it today. The psychoanalytic tradition, which is the first force in counseling. The second force is referred to as the cognitive/behavioral tradition. The third being the existential/humanistic tradition. The fourth the multicultural counseling paradigm, and last but not least, social justice, the fifth force in counseling and psychotherapy.

2nd Force: The Cognitive/Behavioral Paradigm Interview. Sam Song, Ph.D., Associate Professor, Seattle University 

00:07:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS Hi, my name is Dr. Vong Ratts and I'm here with Dr. Sam Song who is Associate Professor of School of Psychology at Seattle University. And we're here today to talk a little bit more about cognitive/behavioral therapy. Hi Dr. Song. 

00:07:25
SAM SONG Hey, how are you? 

00:07:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS I'm very good. Thank you for taking the time to talk with us about cognitive/behavioral therapy. I know that's a specialty area of yours. 

00:07:35
SAM SONG Sure, no problem, glad to be here. 

00:07:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS I wanted to begin by asking you just if you can give an overview of what CBT is. 

00:07:40
SAM SONG So CBT, cognitive/behavioral therapy, is a system of therapy that seeks to address psychological disorders or, and/or symptomatology by addressing how cognitions influence one's feelings and behaviors. 

00:08:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS I'm wondering if you can share a little bit more about your interests or how your interest in CBT sort of evolved, what got you into it. 

00:08:10
SAM SONG Yea, well, to be honest, I was trained in CBT in graduate school when I was doing my psychology training, and more specifically though, what I really like about it is that I work with kids and adolescents a lot, and I'm actually a school psychologist and a licensed psychologist. And so the important part of, of that is CBT is pretty effective with children and adolescents. So, and also adults of course, but... 

00:08:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS What makes that effective in particular with children and adolescents? 

00:08:55
SAM SONG Well, when you're 

00:08:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS Versus other theories in counseling and psychology. 

00:08:55
SAM SONG Yea, so basically what I mean by that is in terms of the empirical research, that CBT is well substantiated. It's, there's a lot of studies showing that it's effective. But if you're asking how it is, how it is effective, then in particular it's, it's really good at reducing symptoms. Okay, so I think that's pretty important to understand. And then when you're working with children and teenagers, and even adults who may not have a, may not be strong in their cognition in terms of their cognitive thinking, CBT is nice because it allows us to work behaviorally as needed. So for example if you have a kindergartener and having some issues, you're likely to de-emphasize the cognitive strategies and focus more on the behavioral 'cause those are the ones that are shown to be effective for the child. 

00:10:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS So it sounds like it's really a theory that's unlike existentialism or humanistic theories in counseling where you can really measure the interventions that you employ as the therapist or as a school psychologist or as a psychologist in the field. It's something that is more tangible. You can see results. 

00:10:30
SAM SONG Yea, so you're saying that CBT is measurable, correct? 

00:10:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yea. 

00:10:35
SAM SONG It is indeed. It's funny because I really, I've been, had the great opportunity of having supervisors who are psychoanalytic, psychodynamic or humanistic or whatever, what have you. I've had a number of supervisors, and what's been interesting from my work with them and other therapists who prescribe to say, other theories, when you're working with kids, they all say, y'all got to get behavioral. And I think that's one interesting factoid just to throw out there. Another interesting factoid is that so many medical centers and community clinics, because of managed healthcare, are really needing to document and write their treatment goals behaviorally and whether you like it or not, you got to be at least literate in being able to write your objectives in that way. 

00:11:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS You talked about three aspects of CBT, thoughts, behaviors, and 

00:11:45
SAM SONG Feelings. 

00:11:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS emotions or feelings, and it sounds like what you're saying is with CBT, the focus is really on thoughts and behaviors over feelings. Is that right? 

00:11:55
SAM SONG Yea, it is because, the reason I'm responding this way is because it's a little bit more complex than that. So the short answer is yes, it is. It is focused on cognitions and behaviors, so thoughts and what you do, thus the name, cognitive/behavioral therapy. However, the emotions and feelings are addressed. It's just they're addressed through, via cognitions and behaviors, and one interesting thing I challenge my students to think about and you can think about, we can think about together here, is what is a true emotional intervention? And when you start to think about what is an intervention in terms of what you would do and have the client do in therapy, it seems to me that you are intervening through cognition or behaviors. Right? 

00:13:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay, are there different variations of CBT? 

00:13:05
SAM SONG Yes, there are. The biggest one obviously is the cognitive therapists, so Aaron Beck, Judith Beck, they're, they came out pretty much saying that it's cognitive therapy, where it's primarily focused on thinking and thoughts and your core beliefs. However, they do integrate Gestalt and behavioral therapies as well, but they wouldn't necessarily call themselves CBT. But when you look at textbooks, other people just clump them together. The other variation would be the more behavioral side. So you have people who are much more on the behavioral side than cognitive. So they might be called, better yet, behavioral/cognitive therapists. Right, so where they primarily focus on behavior and then do a little bit of cognition work. In the literature, these people, this group, okay, is probably best described as cognitive/behavior modification people. Yea. 

00:14:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay. 

00:14:20
SAM SONG Of course, we're categorizing and things. 

00:14:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yea. 

00:14:20
SAM SONG and labelling, generalizing so, but yea. 

00:14:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS Sort of, how has this particular theoretical paradigm, if you will, evolved to its present state? 

00:14:35
SAM SONG Well, I'm no historian, but you call it the [crosstalk]second force. 

00:14:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS [crosstalk]Second force, right. 

00:14:40
SAM SONG So it's force 2, which is really important but my understanding of it, given that I'm not a historian of psychology is that the behavioral paradigm model has been there, was there first, right. And even before that would be the psychoanalytic, right. And psych-, yea, psychoanalytic. What's interesting is Aaron Beck, who came out with cognitive therapy, was a psychoanalyst, okay, first, and so he discovered this based on his clinical work and he noticed that while he was working with his clients from a psychoanalytic perspective, when he just used certain cognitive strategies, they had immediate symptom reduction in session. So that's where, how that developed. So I would say he's definitely a major player who came out of the psychoanalytic tradition. And then the behaviorist, they, they're pretty obviously, like Watson and Skinner, okay, pretty behavioral, which is great. They should be, that's who they were. 

00:15:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS Purists. 

00:15:50
SAM SONG Yea, and what happened was this cognitive revolution, right, in response to the behavioral, and which also I suppose grew out of the psychoanalytic as well. They, the behavioral people were reacting to a back..., so they started to integrate some of the cognitive, is what I understand. So then you got Robert Ellis in there, obviously who is a major player. He was 1962, a little bit before Aaron Beck. Glasser could be construed as a cognitive behavioral person. 

00:16:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS His choice theory tenets are 

00:16:30
SAM SONG Sure 

00:16:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS CBT 

00:16:35
SAM SONG Now if you ask a Glasser person, they might not see that, okay. Lazarus, and then Micenbomb. 

00:16:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay, okay. 

00:16:45
SAM SONG Yea, would be the really good middle person. 

00:16:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yea. 

00:16:50
SAM SONG Of CBT. 

00:16:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS That's a lot of major figures that have, that you talked about that have really shaped to, to its present state. In terms of how do you operationalize CBT in practice? What would that look like if a therapist or a psychologist were to work with a client from a CBT perspective? 

00:17:10
SAM SONG The first thing that I do and that I teach my students is when you're meeting with a client, you want to really focus on rapport building and building that therapeutic alliance, and in fact, to some people that's surprising. But nowadays, for maybe the past 15, 20 years I would say maybe even, that all the therapists, even a behavioral therapist, really does need to focus on the therapeutic alliance. Well, not only needs, but they do that, okay. That's part of who they are. Now an applied behavioral analyst might disagree, I don't know, okay, but that would be, I kind of put them in a separate camp. 

00:18:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS So what you're really saying is CBT sort of evolved in this sense of there's a focus on the relationship, whereas when Ellis sort of came about and CBT came about, the relationship wasn't as emphasized. And some would say, would even say, that it was de-emphasized. 

00:18:25
SAM SONG I would say that's true for the behavioral folks. For Ellis, I'm unsure. 

00:18:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay. 

00:18:30
SAM SONG Okay, but I do know in the Beck paradigm, the therapeutic alliance is central. 

00:18:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay. 

00:18:35
SAM SONG Yea, so, so that's the first thing I would do. If it was a kid, then I might just start, obviously after those typical introductory type procedures, you might just start talking, seeing how things are going, engage in a game, you know, drawing of some sort, and just really trying to build trust. So that would be really important. And then the second thing that I would do quickly is I would get into trying to understand the client's experience. Okay, so through that rapport building, I would try to, I'd be doing assessment. 

00:19:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay. 

00:19:15
SAM SONG Okay, and here's where the cognitive/behavioral stuff will start to come into play is I'll start listening and then I'll start keying in on automatic thoughts, on behaviors that seem to be problematic, okay, and looking at settings and situations in which they occur, right. But 

00:19:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS So patterns 

00:19:40
SAM SONG Yes, but they'll all be saved in my head obviously. You know, I won't be necessarily writing it down. A beginning therapist could be doing that but, so that's the way it would work. And then, as I start to do that, I would get into teaching indirectly the cognitive model, or cognitive/behavioral model, which essentially just is, just to reiterate when I said this earlier, which is it's just that thinking, feelings, and behaviors are connected, okay. So I might begin to educate the client, indirectly though, so what that means is they don't really know it's happening. Okay, so it might be in my summary. Okay, when I paraphrase something, I might say something like, oh so this, your mom or dad was upset with you and you're telling me that you did this behavior, right, and you also said that you were thinking this. Is that right? Right, you see, so I might throw that in there and so, from just by interacting with me, I'm starting to help the client to understand things. Now if it's a kid or a lower-functioning teenager, then I might go into a drawing to do that. Okay, start drawing cartoons and start asking about how they feel and you know, what's, what are they, what's going through their head, those types of things. And then I would get into goals. 

00:21:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay, okay. 

00:21:25
SAM SONG And trying to build motivation for change. 

00:21:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS So there's a lot of focus on cognition, behavior, sounds like you're saying there's an educational component to CBT in terms of educating the client. 

00:21:40
SAM SONG Sure, yea. 

00:21:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS In a subtle way. And it's really a theory that's outcome-based or goal-oriented. 

00:21:45
SAM SONG Sure. 

00:21:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS Which seems like it lends itself to being able to measure in terms of effectiveness if you will. 

00:21:55
SAM SONG Yea. 

00:22:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS Are there particular techniques that are pretty popular amongst CBT therapists, within the CBT perspective? 

00:22:05
SAM SONG Sure, sure. So in terms of the behavioral strategies, there's a lot that I think every counselor, psychotherapist and psychologist know. They include looking at their reinforcement systems, the individual, conducting a functional behavioral assessment, okay which is basically looking at patterns of behavior, when they're occurring, what's triggering them, what's happening, what's a consequence, what are they getting out of that, obviously the use of reinforcement, self-reinforcement, modelling role-playing in counseling, relaxation training, biofeedback and self-regulation training, systematic de-sensitization, exposure and response prevention, and social skills training. Those are all from the behavioral paradigm. They all came from the behavioral paradigm. The more cognitive ones would be teaching and understanding about, of the cognitive model, how thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are related and influence one another. It would be teaching, teaching the client to assess their own thoughts, okay, and then evaluate them, and during that assessment, they look at feelings to and say or talk about what they're feeling during that time, and then they learn to, through Socratic questioning, and questioning techniques where they evaluate their beliefs, their thoughts, and see whether or not they're true or if there's evidence for it. So what's the evidence, is a classic strategy. 

00:23:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS So these are really, these techniques that you're talking about really are techniques that clients can utilize themselves and sounds like also very empowering in the sense of it allows them to sort of navigate their own world. 

00:24:10
SAM SONG Definitely, so the goal of cognitive/behavioral therapy is to empower the client by teaching them effective coping strategies as they cope with their environment, okay, and specifically targeted towards, originally, towards symptom reduction. 

00:24:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS You talked a lot about, throughout the course of our conversation, the benefits of CBT. It's measurable, there are a lot of techniques that are practical for clients, there's an educational component. I'm curious what you see, or what folks are saying in terms of the limitations of CBT. 

00:24:55
SAM SONG Well, the limitations of CBT, there are several. First and foremost, the idea that we don't deal with emotions, okay, done well, emotions are a big part of it in the sense of the clients understand how their emotions are related to even their physiology, right, that they're physiological symptoms, and how that happens. But then, it's really about, well how do you intervene? So like, if you're feeling this emotion, strong feeling, what is a truly emotional intervention? If you're doing something behavioral or cognitive, like the actual strategy that you're having the client do, it really is. Now it doesn't have to be conceptualized that way, but CBT conceptualizes it that way. So that's kind of one thing that I would say. So emotion reduction, symptoms based on your feelings are, is a big part of it. Now of course, the emotional-focused therapists would disagree with me, but, okay, I understand that. The other piece of it is that, another critique that I hear a lot from psychodynamic folks are, well you're only doing symptom reduction. You're not really healing the person in total, right, or you're not doing any deep, right, deep reconstruction and kind of healing, inner healing type of thing. 

00:26:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS Not really tapping into the unconscious. 

00:26:35
SAM SONG Yea. Does that make sense? So we're only focused on the surface, right? And what I've been saying, well there's two parts to this answer. It's a good one. Okay, is that, yes that's true. We are focused on symptom reduction, because that's very important, right. That's some, when someone has symptoms that are unwanted, that's suffering, okay. So whether or not some of the situations in the person's life are within or beyond their control, whether or not that's true or not, I understand that. But they still have symptoms, right. And so we're empowering people to deal with their symptoms, right. And so remember, a lot of this, a lot of this came out of, so Aaron Beck is a psychiatrist, right, he's an MD so he was working with people with disorders, okay, psychopathology, so that's kind of where that came out, that's the history of that, if that makes sense, right. And so that's a very important piece. I think that symptom reduction is important. The other piece of that, the strategy of well, you're not healing, is that the Becks, Judith Beck, would say that CBT does get pretty deep, okay. It really goes at underlying core beliefs. So for example if you're starting with someone who is depressed, dealing with depressed mood, they might have thoughts that, hey my life sucks or I have no friends, right, but we do go deeper, and the deeper part of that would be related to their core beliefs and/or part of their self-concept which is really, could be a feeling, a belief that they are unlovable, right, that something that they're a failure. Right, does that make sense? So that's pretty deep, okay, it's just we don't go there in the beginning. Right. But the other side of that issue, that criticism is this, is that if you're thinking about schools, working in, with kids especially, then, and then you're also thinking about people who do not have the resources to see someone for long-term therapy, right. Then what would you choose, right? I would probably go for symptom reduction, right. You know, what's the average length of students, clients who are diverse, in therapy? How long do they stay in therapy? 

00:29:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS Not as long as 

00:29:30
SAM SONG Yea, not very long. 

00:29:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yea. 

00:29:35
SAM SONG And my experience is somet-, you know, a lot of them, they drop out, right, and obviously there's a lot of reasons for that. I'm not saying that, but what I'm saying is if you only got them for five times, okay 

00:29:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yea 

00:29:45
SAM SONG Then you know, some of the deep healing takes a long time, right. 

00:29:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yea. 

00:29:50
SAM SONG And then my question to people is well, where, you got to think about, of it ethically, right. So like, it's an ethical dilemma. If you know someone's going to be there for a short amount of time, is it ethical to begin deep healing and not finish, and when you know that person might leave? Or is better to give them some skills so they can cope with their environment better? Right, and then all of this kind of comes out in schools, in schools where you don't have a lot of time, okay, and kids, a lot of times they aren't, you're going to see they aren't very, you know, they're, schools are not made to see long-term, right. So you got to really think about the bigger picture on that. 

00:30:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS So there's really a, I'm sorry I don't mean to interrupt you, but this is very interesting for me. So there's really a pragmatic component to CBT is what I hear you saying in the sense of not a lot of people in our community have the resources to be able to go to therapy for 3, 4, 5 years and not a lot of managed care companies will support a person going 

00:31:05
SAM SONG That's right, that's right. 

00:31:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS through therapy for such a long period of time, and then schools, that's not really realistic and so there's a benefit to, one of the benefits to CBT is it's really pragmatic, it's really realistic, it's, there's a lot or short-term benefits. 

00:31:25
SAM SONG Sure, sure. There are. And I know that that can be criticized for, it's a complex issue, but I do want to throw that out there for the audience to consider. The other critique of CBT is related to this, which is it's not very sensitive to diversity or hasn't been, right. Not there has been a lot of work since its inception, but I'll say 2 or 3 things on that. One, depending, you know how there's different flavors of CBT, the Beck flavor and the Micenbomb, right, and the other I'm not as sure, positive as those. I'm not saying they're not, but at least with Beck, what drives the CBT approach, the cognitive approach, is the conceptualization, an ever-evolving conceptualization of the client based on who that client is, and so diversity factors need, are considered in the conceptualization and as you start to get to know the client better, if you're, if you see things that can be addressed through social action or having them, empowering the client to go out and do some, change the environment somehow, then that would be a logical intervention. It's not de-emphasized. I mean, it's de-emphasized in the cognitive/behavioral, in the true form, but you can do that. 

00:33:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS So if I understand you correctly, I sounds like what you're saying is CBT is sort of evolving to integrate culture and the needs of diverse client populations and that conceptualization of client problems and so not only do CBT focus, therapists focus on cognition, behavior and affect or emotion, but they also focus on a client's culture and trying to figure out how much of, if I'm hearing you correctly, their cultural background influences their thought patterns whereas if they weren't going to focus on that, I could see how you might think of a particular thought pattern as irrational or unhealthy or maladaptive, whereas 

00:33:50
SAM SONG Sure 

00:33:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS when you consider it from a culture perspective 

00:33:50
SAM SONG Yea 

00:33:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS it may be considered healthy. 

00:33:55
SAM SONG Exactly right. Now what you said is correct. I would say that a skilled therapist is very important for that. Now the critique, and I know, I'm familiar with the multicultural literature as well, the problem is that even though these older, or some older systems of therapy have always said conceptualization and knowing the client's culture and all that, it hasn't been that effective still. Right, or they haven't changed enough to be more sensitive to culture and races. 

00:34:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS It's the peripheral. 

00:34:35
SAM SONG Yea, so that, I acknowledge that. Okay, and I would say also that there's newer ways to do it, and I'll talk about that a little bit later. But that's been a critique. I think it's a valid of criticism, so I'm by no way saying that's not a valid criticism. So some thought patterns and behaviors are going to be culturally appropriate, right, for the client's family, whereas the therapist may think that's pathological and/or develop a treatment goal to try to change that. Right, that's definitely true. That can happen, that's not a good situation of course. The other side is some of the behavioral strategies, some minority groups actually agree with some of those behavioral strategies. Okay, and I think part of it, the underlying idea is about control, and giving the client empowerment and control versus, so for example a behavioral approach would give control to an external person, who then could oppress, continue to oppress the person, right, and then, so I think that's just a complexity that some minority groups like that. Right, they want to, in their families they want to maintain control. Okay, and a great situation might be, so you might have an Asian family, a minority family who for their culture likes to have control of their kids, but the child, teenager is having some issues because of that, right. Now from some orientations where we empower the child to change that, you know, fight against that, then that could be creating additional stress in the client's life, right. So I think that there's complexity even with like a social justice perspective counseling where if we're always saying fight the system, fight the system, when does that become not healthy for this particular client. Right, I'm in no advocating racism or institutionalized racism. I believe in all of that but I'm not giving answer either, okay, I just raise those questions that that's challenging, you know. 

00:37:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS It's a lot more complex. 

00:37:25
SAM SONG Yea, it's challenging and so that's why, well you know I love social justice and I believe in it, and so I think there needs to be continual thinking on this, and looking at some of the benefits of therapies and yea, coming into new kind of forms and probably the best person doing some of that now is Dr. Vong Ratts. Yea, so continue that good work. 

00:37:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS Thank you. 

00:38:00
SAM SONG In school psychology, it's David Triberg. Yea, so. 

00:38:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS I'm wondering, this is my last question, and that's, where do you see the future of CBT? Where is it heading, is there promising research that we should know about? 

00:38:15
SAM SONG Yea, I think the current, I think that future from my perspective, well let me give you, okay, let me give you what I think is maybe accurate from cognitive/behavioral therapists, in general, researchers. That what's down the pipe and developing is just more evidence that it's effective and that it's effective for different clients who are diverse, right, and looking at different ways of implementing CBT, so computers. Computer training is there right now, and that's a big one in the future. How to be, how to bring CBT into schools, right, how to do it more short-term, how to be more social justice and multicultural with it intentionally so that it's no longer harmful for some, right. That's some certain points, I think that's the answer by, that would be more, what most people would agree with, right. The, my answer, which is similar but just to kind of give my take on that, is what I think is really down the pipe and is emphasized is this ecological cognitive behavioral intervention, not therapy, intervention. Intervention would be a larger term that includes therapy, but also includes prevention work, right, and coming from a public health prevention science perspective, which is where I come from, that is exciting. You know, how are, how are cognitive/behavioral interventions being integrated into special education programs in schools, so that more kids benefit. How are, is that being implemented at a school-wide level so that all kids can benefit from this, these strategies. And in a way, the people that have been talking about for a while, however I think becoming more explicit and intentional about that is in the future. And this idea of looking at it from an ecological perspective, right, so that's all consistent with the ecological perspective. So the ecological perspective is the person, so it would be the person in terms of all of who they are, their thoughts, feelings, behaviors, their body physiology, right, their culture, okay, all of that comes with them in interaction with the environment which includes systems change, which includes culture and climate of a school, which includes people who are oppressive, right, and racism, right. Racism and all those I guess unhealthy structures that can develop, that integration, a developmental approach also, so like Nancy Getta, a lot of the school psychology cognitive/behavioral therapy people, are coming from this perspective, which is really where, that's my perspective. Okay, I would say Micenbomb's stuff is really one example. However I'm really even broader than that. 

00:41:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS It's really interesting to CBT has evolved really from a paradigm that was really interpsyche in nature in terms of focusing solely on the client, their thoughts, their feelings, their behaviors, to sort of looking at the client in context of their environment and one of the things you're talking about that really sounds interesting is how can we make CBT more prevention-based in terms of working in communities and schools, being more proactive, which I can see why the evolution of changing a term from therapy to intervention. There's, it's a lot broader. 

00:42:30
SAM SONG Yea, and dealing with mental health, coming from public health perspective, all of that, I just did a six session lecture series in Washington to the School Psychology Association in Washington to practitioners on this topic and so, it was, yea, I think that that's really important. The other piece that I wrote down, I have some notes here, mindfulness, the integration of mindfulness with CBT especially working with personality disorders, that's kind of a newer, a newer thing and you know to be honest I don't know, the mindfulness people, I don't know what they would say about that integration with CBT, if they like that idea or if they want to consider themselves to be more separate from, but 

00:43:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS That's something that's 

00:43:20
SAM SONG Yea. 

00:43:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS evolving 

00:43:25
SAM SONG Yea, well it's happening now, so these are all things that are happening now, right. 

00:43:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yea. 

00:43:30
SAM SONG But I think that they'll be better developed in the future. Some of my work is looking at classrooms and doing class-wide cognitive/behavioral interventions, however that are from ecological, so it includes some developmental things in there, right, and systems work, so yea, that's coming down the pipe. 

00:43:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS Well Dr. Song, I just want to say thank you for giving your time to share with us your perspective on CBT. I know I learned a lot and I know it was very insightful for me and 

00:44:05
SAM SONG Oh well, yea, thanks. 

00:44:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS all the things you shared so thank you very much. 

00:44:10
SAM SONG Thanks for being here, for, with me, so inviting me. It's been fun.

Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy 

00:45:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS Today what you're going to be doing is watching part of a larger video segment titled "Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy." For this particular video segment, you're going to be watching and what we're going to be doing is focusing on the second force in counseling and psychotherapy which is the cognitive/behavioral tradition in the field. We're going to begin this particular video by showing an interview that I conduct with Dr. Sam Song who is an Associate Professor here at Seattle University. He's also an expert in CBT who's done a lot of research in the cognitive/behavioral tradition and he's going to be talking about the major historical perspectives of CBT, some of the major tenets of CBT and also highlight some of the major research that's happening right now that is having a significant impact on the cognitive/behavioral tradition. Following my interview with Dr. Song, what you will be doing is watching a live video or live counseling session with a particular client. The therapist that's going to work with this client is Dr. Katherine Nordell Fort, who is a counselor at Bellevue College, and what she'll be doing is demonstrating how to operationalize CBT in a clinical setting. Again, this particular video series is part of a larger video series titled "Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy" where we compare and contrast the major forces in the field that have really shaped counseling as we know it today. The psychoanalytic tradition, which is the first force in counseling. The second force is referred to as the cognitive/behavioral tradition. The third being the existential/humanistic tradition. The fourth the multicultural counseling paradigm, and last but not least, social justice, the fifth force in counseling and psychotherapy. 

00:47:05
2nd Force: The Cognitive/Behavioral Approach to Psychotherapy. Katherine Nordell Fort, Counselor, Bellevue College 

00:47:10
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Hi Annie. 

00:47:10
ANNIE Hi. 

00:47:10
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT I'm Katherine. 

00:47:10
ANNIE I'm Annie. 

00:47:15
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Nice to meet you. So you've come into my office today for some counseling, and I'd love to hear a little bit about how I can help you and what your thoughts are about coming in today. 

00:47:25
ANNIE Okay. Well it's my first time so it's kind of unfamiliar and a bit nerve-wracking. 

00:47:35
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT First time getting counseling. 

00:47:35
ANNIE Yea. 

00:47:35
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea. 

00:47:35
ANNIE And honestly I didn't really want to come. 

00:47:40
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Okay. 

00:47:40
ANNIE My friend kind of made me come, so. 

00:47:45
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So tell me about your friend having you come. What did she say to you? 

00:47:50
ANNIE Well, she's been trying to contact me for a couple weeks 'cause we're classmates. 

00:47:55
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Okay. 

00:47:55
ANNIE And I haven't been going to class, so she was worried and you know, she was calling and I wasn't picking up. So she came to the door and you know, made me go with her, so. 

00:48:05
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So you were staying home, not going to class, and that made her worried about you. 

00:48:10
ANNIE Yea. 

00:48:10
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea. How are you feeling about not going to class? 

00:48:15
ANNIE Well, I think I'm dropping out anyway so I feel like there's no point in going to class anymore so, you know. 

00:48:25
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So tell me a little about what you're doing in school. 

00:48:30
ANNIE Oh, well, I'm just taking some general classes right now at the community college. 

00:48:35
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Okay. 

00:48:35
ANNIE And working towards a degree, yea, so. 

00:48:45
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea. So taking some classes but at this point there's some stuff going on in your life that's kind of feeling like maybe, maybe school isn't what you want to be doing at this moment? 

00:48:55
ANNIE Yea, well, the reason why I went back to school you know, was to, my husband lost his job a couple, like a year or two ago, so we thought that maybe you know I should get a job too. And so I thought that maybe going to a community college, getting some experience over there would help make me more marketable. But then he found another job and actually we're pretty good right, pretty stable right now, more than last year. So he was thinking that I don't need to, you know, continue. So. 

00:49:35
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Okay, so you've had some input from your, your husband and kind of saying maybe you don't need to do school. When you say things are things are good, or things are better, is that kind of an economic, talking about economic stability? 

00:49:45
ANNIE Yea, yea. 

00:49:45
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea. And for you, with the thought about school, was it something that you were interested in doing beyond economics or was that pretty much purely to kind of stabilize you guys? 

00:50:00
ANNIE Yea, that was the purpose, I mean that was the intent, and you know, then when I actually started I kind of like it. You know, it was actually kind of fun. I didn't think I would like it so much, so yea. 

00:50:15
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So I'm hearing kind of two different that are a little bit, one is you liking school and enjoying going to classes and maybe being a little bit surprised even about kind of finding something that you enjoy about it. 

00:50:30
ANNIE Yea. 

00:50:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT And then the other piece that's kind of the influence from your husband saying that maybe this isn't something that we need you to be doing at this point. 

00:50:35
ANNIE Right. 

00:50:40
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Is there at all any kind of emotional tear for yourself in that? 

00:50:45
ANNIE I guess, you know, so, yea, I guess. Yea. I really like going to class and I like meeting with my friends afterwards and talking about things and it just felt, it just feels more purposeful than as being a homemaker, you know, cleaning the house and you know doing those kind of things. So. 

00:51:15
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So tell me more about purposeful, when you use that word. What does the purposeful mean to you? 

00:51:25
ANNIE It's something that I think, I just know that I would be good at it. You know, good academically because I never was really. I'm surprised at the comments I get. You know, I'm surprised at, I'm such a, you know, I'm not bad. So it feels like you know maybe there's more than just being at home. And I don't really know what that purpose is. It just seems like there's more, it's more meaningful. 

00:52:00
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So meaningful, purposeful, these are some pretty strong words. 

00:52:05
ANNIE Yea, I guess. 

00:52:05
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT They're powerful to me, they feel kind of powerful. 

00:52:10
ANNIE I guess so, even if I don't know what it is. I guess. 

00:52:15
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea. So if you don't mind, I'm going to go back to how you said your friend was worried about you and how she said that you know you haven't been going to class and that was her concern. So tell me what's been kind of going on recently that's brought you to stay home and not go to class. 

00:52:30
ANNIE Well my husband said there's no, you know, there's no point in going to class, so, you know, and it's, it's economically, you know, at home he's the breadwinner so I feel like if there's no need and he's the one who is paying for the classes basically, you know then I don't, I don't feel like I should. 

00:53:05
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Okay, so there's this feeling that's kind of like maybe I shouldn't be doing this at this point. 

00:53:15
ANNIE Yea, if there's no need for our family to do it then I mean there's no point to it, you know. So just, and you know, so it will take a couple more years to finish it, right. So. 

00:53:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea, so I'm hearing kind of those two different things again, you know, the part about being purposeful and kind of that meaningful bit about going to school and finding maybe some talent or some skills that you didn't see in yourself before you went back, and then on the other hand, I'm hearing that piece about your husband saying you know, this isn't something that you should be doing and we don't need you to do this. And just hearing that, you know, I feel kind of like gosh, that's a bit conflicting. You know, it's got to be hard hearing both of those kind of messages, internal and external. 

00:54:05
ANNIE Yea. 

00:54:05
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT How is that sitting with you? 

00:54:10
ANNIE I try not, I try not to think about it. I mean, if it's going to have be one way anyway, then what's the point of thinking about it and dwelling on it. So. 

00:54:25
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So kind of avoiding thinking about it. 

00:54:25
ANNIE I guess, yea. 

00:54:25
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea. So in terms of your expectations of our time together, I think I'd like to hear a little bit about that since your friend, you know, suggested that you come, but you're saying that you're kind of reticent and haven't had counseling before. Do you have any goals or expectations of our time together? 

00:54:50
ANNIE No, I don't really know what is supposed to happen here, so 

00:54:50
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea. Well, one thing that I'm hearing is kind of just that strength in those around you, you know your friend suggesting counseling and you're coming here but not really knowing what to get from it or what you're looking for or maybe if, if this is something that you want. And then I'm also hearing the influence of your husband and his, and his thinking and his influence, and I guess I'm just really curious about you, you know, about learning more about you and what your thinking is and your hopes. How does that sit with you? 

00:55:35
ANNIE It, that sounds good. So, yea. 

00:55:40
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So let's go back to the school piece then a little bit more. And tell me, when you said that you were feeling kind of purposeful and that there was meaning in school. What kinds of things were going on for you in your day to day life that was starting to feel like there was purpose there? 

00:56:00
ANNIE Just the conversations, you know, you would have with the classmates, it's the questions professors ask, you know, the papers you write. It was applying things that I'm learning and seeing patterns and you know, understanding cause and effect and yea. 

00:56:20
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT And these were things that you were enjoying. 

00:56:20
ANNIE Yea, you know, I was good at that. I mean, not like the best, but you know, it's just really, it was really fun. 

00:56:35
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT And you said you were good at it. Can you tell me if there were any kind of thoughts that you had, you know, going on that were saying, gosh you know, I'm surprised that I got this grade on this, or I'm actually pretty good at this. Were there kind of those revelations that you had? 

00:56:50
ANNIE Yea, you know. Yea. 

00:56:55
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Do you remember any in particular? 

00:56:55
ANNIE Yea, maybe like getting an A on a paper. We'd analyze a character from a movie and it was so much fun working on it, and then professors really appreciated the insight and the depth I guess I put in the paper, and so I was like, oh, you know, those things are worth something I guess. So, yea, that was fun. 

00:57:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea. So one of the themes I'm kind of seeing here is that you're talking about meaning and purpose and value I think. Those are kind of similar words that I feel like are pretty impactful, but that's my reaction to hearing those words, and I'm wondering if you're, kind of if you're hearing yourself talk about you know, the value and meaning that you were feeling. 

00:57:55
ANNIE It's different than what I thought I wanted I guess. 

00:58:00
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Say more about that. 

00:58:00
ANNIE I thought that, we thought that at this point in our life, you know, we'd be starting a family and that's what I thought I wanted, and I do. I still do, maybe not yet. So, yea. So I don't know. 

00:58:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So kind of some surprise maybe within yourself. 

00:58:35
ANNIE Yea, yea, and that's what my husband wants too. 

00:58:45
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT That's what he wants at this point. 

00:58:45
ANNIE Yea. 

00:58:45
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT How about you? What do you want at this point? 

00:58:50
ANNIE It doesn't really matter what I want, so, I, so. It doesn't really matter what I want, so. 

00:58:55
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Is that how you're feeling, like your own 

00:59:00
ANNIE Yea. 

00:59:00
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Your own opinion or your own heart, they're kind of now, they're secondary here. 

00:59:10
ANNIE I guess, yea. 

00:59:10
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT How is that, feeling like that? 

00:59:15
ANNIE It's a little bit frustrating, you know, but I don't know, it's frustrating but it's not, I think I'm more frustrated with myself than my husband. You know, we got into an argument about it. But I, it's frustrating you know because it's frustrating arguing with him and, because I can't, I'm not quick on my feet, you know, so I can't win arguments with him. I hate that. So I'm frustrated with myself for that, and then it's also frustrating because I feel like, you know I feel so like I'm flip flopping so much. 

01:00:15
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Tell me about the flip flopping a little bit more. What are you flip flopping? 

01:00:20
ANNIE Just thought, you know, that we had the same goals when we entered the marriage, and then now that I want something different, I feel kind of like I'm just flip flopping you know, and when I'm at home and by myself, I do that a lot 'cause he works, my mind just always flip flops with what I want and what I should have, so I'm frustrated with myself. 

01:00:50
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So I'm hearing a lot of frustration, that word frustration, and that feeling of going back and forth between two different things, and that just sounds like it's a tear, like it's a hard, a hard feeling to be going back and forth. I'm also still hearing a lot of that, the piece about your husband really influencing kind of your, your thinking about what you want to do with your life. 

01:01:20
ANNIE Yea. 

01:01:20
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT And I'm even hearing a little bit of frustration toward him underneath that. It's not something that you've said but that seems to be something that's kind of underneath it. Do you feel some of those reactions toward him? 

01:01:35
ANNIE Yea, yea, yea. But it, but maybe it's, maybe he just doesn't understand how much I, you know, I want to go back to school, 'cause I'm not good at, I'm not good at arguing with him, not good at, you know, being able to make sense when I'm talking to him. So when we're talking out, or pretty much arguing, if I don't make sense and my words all jumble, then you know, I'm so incoherent, you know, and he's so logical. You know, how can I, it's more frustrating, I'm more frustrated at myself because how can I expect him to get it if I can't verbalize it. 

01:02:35
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Sounds like you're pretty hard on yourself. 

01:02:40
ANNIE I guess so. 

01:02:40
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT How often are you guys arguing? 

01:02:45
ANNIE More than before. So, yea. 

01:02:55
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT What kind of arguments are you having? Can you describe how they look to me? 

01:02:55
ANNIE It's you know, about school, you know, other people, the friends that I hang out 'cause you know, I hang out with them afterschool and we do things together and so if I'm not home when he's home, on those days he wants me to come home right after class and you know, get dinner ready and, but sometimes you know, my classmates go out afterwards and, yea, so I'm not home when he wants me to be. And with school and everything, it's the house not the way it used to be of course. So now we have arguments about that, yea, and then school of course because it's, it's an expense, you know, and an unneeded expense. 

01:03:50
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT According to you or him? 

01:03:50
ANNIE to him 

01:03:50
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT to both of you? 

01:03:55
ANNIE to him. 

01:03:55
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea, so that sounds like that's, again, that, that tear right there, 'cause for you, you're feeling that purpose and that this is something that you want and this is something that's, that's good for you and for him, it sounds like he wants things a certain way at home, and that it sounds like it's been pretty controlling for you. 

01:04:20
ANNIE Yea, I guess so. Yea, but to be, to be fair to him, and it's, it's, it's only recently and we haven't 

01:04:40
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT You say it, when you say it 

01:04:40
ANNIE The fighting 

01:04:40
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT the fighting okay. 

01:04:45
ANNIE So it's only in regards to this issue. 

01:04:45
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So there wasn't fighting before the school piece, is that what you're saying? 

01:04:55
ANNIE No, but usually just when, I usually do you know, what he wants, because it's you know, I didn't, 'cause I'm very easygoing, you know, so I'm like okay, why not, you know. I never really differ in opinion with him, so I think, yea, it's much harder recently because of the school thing, and it's the, oh my god, one thing I really disagreed with him, so 

01:05:40
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT And how, how much is this disagreement impacting your day to day functioning would you say? 

01:05:50
ANNIE I mean, I try not to think about it. 

01:05:55
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So it's something that you're sort of purposely pushing outside of your thinking. 

01:06:00
ANNIE Right. And it's fine when he's home, you know. It's, I don't think about it when he's home. But when he's not, on the day when, on the days that he's working and I'm home by myself, it's, yea, it's kind of, yea. 

01:06:15
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Would you say that kind of pushing something kind of outside of your thoughts is still having an impact on you in a way? 

01:06:25
ANNIE I guess so, I guess so, yea, 'cause I just kind of try and distract myself. 

01:06:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT How's that going, the distracting? 

01:06:40
ANNIE I don't know. 

01:06:40
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT What kinds of things are you doing to distract yourself? 

01:06:45
ANNIE Watching a lot of reality tv, cleaning, shopping, yea. 

01:06:55
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Are these different kinds of behaviors than you would have chosen to do before, if you hadn't been trying to kind of distract yourself from that? 

01:07:05
ANNIE I think, yea, to some extent. 

01:07:10
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea. 

01:07:10
ANNIE Yea. 

01:07:10
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So when you're shopping, I'll pick one, that seems to kind of have come up when you're maybe pushing some of these thoughts aside about you know, the conflict between the two of you. When you're shopping, do thoughts about it ever come into your head? 

01:07:30
ANNIE Yea. 

01:07:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT And what might one of those thoughts sound like? 

01:07:40
ANNIE You know I just, if I notice the time, you know I think, oh it's time for class. 

01:07:45
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So just kind of a fleeting 

01:07:45
ANNIE Yea. 

01:07:45
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT And noticing that 

01:07:45
ANNIE Yea. 

01:07:50
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea, and then how does that, how does that impact you? How does that make you feel when you have that thought, even just a little fleeting thought? 

01:08:00
ANNIE I remember the last time I had that thought, it was at a store that was playing really loud music, so that music sort of blocked out the feeling that I had. But like on the bus or you know, on the street, when there's no distraction besides my head, the thoughts inside my head, then it's, it's sad. You know, I get sad. I get sad, so. 

01:08:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So that sad feeling. Explain a little bit more about sad. 

01:08:35
ANNIE It's in my stomach. Yea, I don't know why I'm saying my stomach. It just 

01:08:40
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Okay. 

01:08:45
ANNIE Seems like it's there. 

01:08:45
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea, that's where you're noticing it in that moment. 

01:08:45
ANNIE Yea. 

01:08:45
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea. So interestingly, there's kind of this, this difficult to understand connection between you noticing it's time for class, you know, maybe just kind of a fleeting, a fleeting thought, a fleeting notice, and then an emotion that comes with that that's kind of that sad feeling and then even a physical kind of reaction. 

01:09:10
ANNIE Yea. 

01:09:10
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT From noticing. And how many times a day do you think you're having some of these, these thoughts, even the smaller ones? 

01:09:20
ANNIE I don't know, it, maybe about, around ten I guess. Between five and ten, I think. 

01:09:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT And is there a time of day that you're noticing it more, or activity that kind of brings up some of these thinking patterns a little bit more? 

01:09:40
ANNIE Definitely between the time that my husband goes to work and the time that he comes back from work, when I'm by myself. 

01:09:50
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So when he's kind of outside of the house and you have that control over your own, your own life a little bit in those hours. 

01:09:55
ANNIE Yea. 

01:09:55
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea. And yet you're not, you're not going to school. You're not choosing to go to school. Is that a choice that you feel that you have? 

01:10:15
ANNIE No, but 

01:10:15
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT This is a choice that's been taken away from you. 

01:10:20
ANNIE It's, but it's the right choice though. You know, it's the right choice I make, it's the practical choice. It's the right choice to make. 

01:10:35
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT For you? 

01:10:35
ANNIE [crosstalk]for the family 

01:10:40
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT [crosstalk]or for the relationship? 

01:10:40
ANNIE for the family, yea. If it was up to me, I would go, and have the money, I would go, but I don't. 

01:10:50
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So that sounds like that's the conundrum there a little bit is making a decision around, in a sense I hear you making a decision around your own kind of desires and things that you want to do, and then making a choice around what you feel is,  what's best for your family or what's best for that unit. And those two things kind of pitted against each other a little bit. 

01:11:25
ANNIE Yea, yea, yea. 

01:11:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT What do you feel is in your, your control in this situation, kind of getting back to what you can, what you can do for yourself. 

01:11:40
ANNIE Not think about it. 

01:11:45
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Not think about it. 

01:11:45
ANNIE Yea. 

01:11:45
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Okay, so that's one of the choices that you can make is you can continue to push it, push it aside when you attempt to do that, or have you attempted to do that I should ask you first. Have you tried just saying I'm done with this, I'm not thinking about it at all? 

01:12:00
ANNIE I try. You know, shopping, housework. 

01:12:05
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Right. 

01:12:05
ANNIE And tv. I'm trying. 

01:12:15
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT But it comes back. 

01:12:15
ANNIE Yes. 

01:12:15
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea. 

01:12:20
ANNIE So, it will go away, right? 

01:12:25
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Well, how long have you been kind of feeling like this? 

01:12:30
ANNIE Let's see. We started arguing like a month, a month and a half ago. I haven't gone to class in over a month. That's about the time. So yea, then a month, a month and a half-ish. So. 

01:12:55
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So for a month and a half, you've been trying to, trying to push this thought away, trying to let go of school essentially. 

01:13:05
ANNIE Yea. 

01:13:05
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT And during that time, it keeps kind of cycling back and feeling sad. 

01:13:10
ANNIE Yea. 

01:13:10
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Having an impact. 

01:13:15
ANNIE Yea, yea, yea. 

01:13:20
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Is it something that you feel like, that you feel strongly about this, this decision with not going to school, you feel like this is, this is the right decision if you had to weigh the two in your mind? 

01:13:35
ANNIE Yea, it's the right decision. Yea, yea because my husband wants you know, to start a family and he's, his job is paying more, so financially we're okay. You know, and timing wise, it's good to start a family now, so why not? 

01:14:05
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Well, I'm going back to the, that feeling of being kind of, you know, purpose and meaning and those kind of things that you mentioned before. To me, that's kind of the two, the two that I'm hearing. Have you mentioned any of that to him when you guys have talked about how you feel, school kind of does that for you? 

01:14:25
ANNIE No, no. 

01:14:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT What do you think might happen if you did? 

01:14:35
ANNIE He laughs at me. So, you know, because those words are kind of fluffy. So that's what he says. Those are those fluffy, feel-good words. You know, so. 

01:14:55
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT What do you think about that? 

01:14:55
ANNIE Well, he's right. It's kind of childish. 

01:15:00
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Childish. 

01:15:05
ANNIE Oh, excuse me. Yea, it's just, it's kind of childish anyway, so and I'm an adult. We're both adults, so we should do what adults should do. Right? And I think if I was, you know, just out of high school and going to college, you know, that's the time for that, you know, but it's not that time anymore, so you know, it's. 

01:15:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So I'm hearing you say that, and I'm hearing you say it's childish and this isn't the time and you know, if I were younger, if I were just out of school, you know, maybe that would be the time, and yet I'm seeing your physical reaction to talking about this and the impact that those thoughts are having on you. What's going on there, you're feeling, emotion? 

01:16:00
ANNIE I shouldn't be feeling this because I should be an adult and reality is in how there's time and place and that's, you know, that's past, so you know, you move on. 

01:16:20
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So I'm going to ask you one more time about that a little bit, because I think what just happened when I asked you about the emotion was a quick, a quick judgment on yourself that said I shouldn't be feeling this. But I want to go back to that question again because I think this is an important one. So when you think about you know, school and him calling it childish and you saying, you know, I don't think he thinks this is for me, and I see that the physical reaction for you without judgment, without saying you know, he's right or it is childish. Can you just tell me a little bit more about what's going on emotionally for you right now? 

01:17:10
ANNIE I've been just reliving, oh my god, bringing up the feelings when I was having when I was arguing with him. I don't like to be called a child. 

01:17:20
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT It's hurtful. 

01:17:25
ANNIE Yea, so. 

01:17:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So his words have a definite impact, a definite emotional impact on you. Yea. You hear them, you know, that little pattern that I just noticed where you hear the word and then quickly kind of push it aside, the emotion, you know, and disregard your own reaction. Do you know what I'm talking about, kind of that, what just happened? 

01:18:00
ANNIE Yea. No, you're right 

01:18:00
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea. 

01:18:05
ANNIE when you said it. Yea. 

01:18:05
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Sometimes I think we do that to kind of survive, survive the moment, you know, survive the argument or survive the situation, you know, kind of push the emotion back down. 

01:18:25
ANNIE Yea, because if I cry in front of him, that would be more childish, wouldn't it? So 

01:18:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So if you let your, your real emotions out, your real feeling out, there's a fear that, that he will just keep going and make it worse, hurt you more. 

01:18:45
ANNIE Yea, I guess. I don't know. 

01:18:50
[sil.] 

01:18:55
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT That sounds hard to try and box, box your emotion in like that, kind of contain your reactions. 

01:19:05
ANNIE Yea, that's what adults do, so 

01:19:15
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT What kind of thoughts are you having right now? 

01:19:20
ANNIE I'm just reliving the argument, the arguments that we've had, and yea. 

01:19:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Are you having a thought about yourself as you're reliving those arguments, like any, any judgments coming up? Are you hearing anything like that? 

01:19:40
ANNIE Yea. Yea, I just feel like such a child. 

01:19:45
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So again that voice that's saying, this is a childish reaction. 

01:19:50
ANNIE Yea, yea. 

01:19:55
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Is there any other voice in there that argues against that? 

01:20:00
ANNIE No, no. I'm just being childish. 

01:20:10
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT That's a pretty strong, pretty strong, strong voice there, that you're feeling. 

01:20:20
ANNIE I guess. I mean, I am, I'm crying right now, so you know. 

01:20:25
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Well, you did say this is your first time in counseling but crying is pretty commonplace in counseling so don't feel 

01:20:30
ANNIE Oh good. 

01:20:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Don't feel hard on yourself there. Definitely happens. That's why we have the Kleenex. 

01:20:40
ANNIE Yea. 

01:20:40
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea. Well, I'm asking about those two pieces because I'm thinking about how you mentioned you know, that feeling of purpose and meaning and I keep going back to that because I feel like there is, there's a part of you that has that voice, that sees the, the need to develop purpose and meaning in your life, and that tension that kind of exists between that, that person and then the person's that's choosing to stay home or to not go to class. 

01:21:20
ANNIE For the longest time, I just thought that you know, my purpose was to be a mom, take care of my family, and then, I guess, what I mentioned today is it seems like I have a different purpose. See, I'm flip flopping, so it'll probably change later on. So it's you know 

01:21:45
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Is that okay, to flip flop, to change, or is that not something you want to do? I'm hearing a little bit of that frustration about it. 

01:21:55
ANNIE I think it's okay 'cause I, it's okay to flip flop in my head about it, but in terms of what I do about it, I don't, it's not okay. 

01:22:05
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So what do you do about it? 

01:22:10
ANNIE Well, I can't change what I want because we worked so hard, you know, why change the plan. And if I flip flop now, what if I flip flop later? So you know 

01:22:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Kind of that unpredictability, it sounds like it's a concern a little bit. 

01:22:30
ANNIE Right, so when I'm wondering, I'm just, it'll pass. 

01:22:35
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So the flip flopping in your head or the emotional feeling of you know, missing school but then being okay staying home and then being sad about not being there and then wanting to you know, do what you think is right for your family and kind of those, those thoughts going back and forth in your head is one piece, but then acting on a day to day basis, it sounds like your saying your actions, you don't want those to flip flop. You're wanting those to stay consistent, which sounds hard to me though. It kind of is a struggle between what we're thinking you know. As human beings, our thoughts have such an impact on how we feel and what we do during the day, that to have those kind of going back and forth and causing some emotional reactions, but then being pretty strict on yourself to just keep consistent during the day, that sounds stressful. Maybe to use a light word, it sounds stressful, it sounds hard. 

01:23:45
ANNIE I guess it's stressful. I don't know, I don't, I don't, I don't feel stressful. It's not the same stress I get when I have a paper due the next day. 

01:24:00
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT It's a different kind of stress. 

01:24:00
ANNIE So I don't, I don't know. 

01:24:05
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Well, before, you mentioned that sometimes that thought of, oh it's time to start class, and then you have kind of an emotional reaction to that. And then, even then, there's a physical reaction, so you know, I would say there's definitely a cause and effect to our thoughts. Is that something that you would agree with? 

01:24:25
ANNIE Yea, yea, yea. 

01:24:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT And yet at the same time, it sounds like these are some thoughts that you're really kind of actively trying to push aside. 

01:24:40
ANNIE Yea, yea. 

01:24:45
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Can you tell me a little bit about why you think that you might be doing that, why you're wanting to push those thoughts aside? 

01:24:55
ANNIE Because they bring on feelings that I don't want to deal with I guess. So yea 

01:25:00
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So this kind of inner, inner turmoil of having a strong feeling and a thought that kind of connects to that feeling and then thinking maybe this isn't going to help me do today's tasks or what it is that you're wanting to kind of maintain during that day. 

01:25:20
ANNIE Yea. When I have those thoughts, I just lie in bed and I don't do anything. And you know if I lie in bed and just think about those things, I don't even try to think about it, it just comes. And I just lie in bed and I'm, and I just sit there. It just, just comes in my head and just I, yea, I don't, it's, I have to stop those thoughts because if I don't, I'm just going to lie in bed. 

01:25:50
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So will you give me another example of one of those thoughts that really just keeps you, keeps you in bed and kind of stops you from moving on your day? 

01:26:05
ANNIE I guess, I guess thoughts of you know, how it's, how it's kind of my fault. You know it's, it's my fault for, you know for the conflict because I feel sort of like I, I change plans on him and it's my fault and so 

01:26:35
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Sounds kind of like a demeaning, a demeaning voice, a little bit that's telling you this is your fault. This is why things are bad. This is why you argue. 

01:26:50
ANNIE Yea, and I, then other times and arguments would come in my head and I would play them in my head, so yea, so I'm not productive when that happens. 

01:27:10
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So those are the thoughts that kind of cage you and keep you from, from living out your day, from maybe doing what you want to do, kind of keep you in bed. So those are some thoughts that are really, in a term that we would use in this form of therapy, very self-defeating, so they're those thoughts that kind of keep you from progressing, you know, keep you caged down or kind of held down. And oftentimes even those thoughts are  connected back to, to something outside of yourself, you know, something that you've heard someone say to you in your life, you know, currently, previously, but those thoughts that really keep you from, from moving forward. And that's why I was kind of going back a little bit earlier about you know, is there another piece of you, is there another piece, that piece of you that feels like looking for meaning and looking for purpose that is maybe a little more of an empowering piece that disagrees with those, those thoughts. 

01:28:15
ANNIE Yea, yea. Maybe I can be more than just be a housewife. I mean, my mom you know, wished she could have been a housewife and but she had to work. So it doesn't, you know, if I, if I have the chance to stay at home with my kids and make the home ready for everyone, you know, it's, that's great. 

01:28:55
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So that's kind of one thought, one thought pattern that's happy, happy with that, thinks that's great. 

01:29:05
ANNIE It's a luxury to not have to work. Yea. 

01:29:15
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT And yet just before that you said be more than just a housewife. Do you feel like those are the same thing, like the one that's the luxury is just, kind of just a housewife, or do you feel like there's something that could happen in addition to being at home and helping your family? What does that look like to you? 

01:29:40
ANNIE There's, we had a guest speaker, a woman, and you know, she worked at the center, you know, just sort of doing research and getting speakers to come to the orientation, and collaborate with organizations and she just seemed so, she just seemed so confident. 

01:30:20
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So something that drew you to that. 

01:30:25
ANNIE Yea. 

01:30:25
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea. 

01:30:30
ANNIE Yes. You know, and, yea, but I don't think she had a family. I don't think she had, I don't think she had a family so she can do that. Right? 

01:30:45
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT One thing that I'm feeling right there is that those are pretty kind of black or white you know, realities. One is saying either you're home and you're taking care of your family and, and that's that. And then the other one is saying that you're this confident person that goes back to school and you know, that, that phrase that you said keeps sticking with me, the more than just a housewife. Those are two, two kind of realities, I guess, that you're seeing and yet it's sounding to me like somewhere in the middle, somewhere in the middle is where you're kind of you know, getting lost a little bit, like it's not the stay at home and it's not necessarily the, the go back to school and all of those things but it's within trying to determine that for yourself how those two worlds look for you and where in that, that reality you fit. That some of these thoughts about, this is childish, you know, the one that stays home may be saying this is childish, this isn't something you need, the family doesn't need this, and then the one that's the confident, you know, school going person saying maybe I can do more than this, maybe there's something more than this, the purpose and the meaning. 

01:32:10
ANNIE Yea, but I'm not her. 

01:32:10
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT You're feeling like you're not this one. 

01:32:15
ANNIE No. 

01:32:15
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT And you're feeling like you're more this one. 

01:32:20
ANNIE Yea. 

01:32:20
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT And yet there's a part of you that you mentioned earlier about school and that you were in school and you were excelling and you were feeling powerful. 

01:32:30
ANNIE I mean, I did fine on a couple papers, you know, but I'm not her. I'm not, I don't speak like her, I'm not confident like her. I can't command attention and do what she does like her, so you know. 

01:32:50
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So when you say that, to me that sounds like, that sounds like this person over here a little bit, doing the talking. You know that thought sounds like I'm not her, I can't be her. It's kind of holding you from, from being her in a sense. Does that make sense? 

01:33:10
ANNIE Yea, it does. 

01:33:15
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Maybe that kind of thinking keeps you from having to, to go there, or having to address that part of you that is interested in being her. 

01:33:25
ANNIE Right. 

01:33:25
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT When you decided to come in today, you mentioned that your friend you know, suggested that you come in for counseling and now that we've had some time together, I'm wondering how you're feeling about coming back. 

01:33:40
ANNIE Yea, I think it would be okay. It's, I don't want to cry anymore but, yea, it's not, not what I thought it was going to be. It's not scary as I thought it was going to be. So yea, yea. 

01:34:00
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So there's something useful maybe in sitting here. 

01:34:00
ANNIE Yea, I guess. 

01:34:00
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea. 

01:34:05
ANNIE Yea. 

01:34:05
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Well, I would be happy to, to meet with you again and, and just thinking about how we were talking about some of your thinking and how those thoughts are affecting your daily functioning and you're emotion and even your stomach and all those things that we mentioned, and I'm wondering if it would be okay with you if I kind of gave you a little bit of homework or basically a small task to try between now and the next time we see each other? 

01:34:35
ANNIE Okay. 

01:34:35
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT So that's okay? 

01:34:35
ANNIE Yea. 

01:34:40
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Okay, so I'm curious about the piece of you that's over here. I think I've done this little visual a couple of times and hopefully you remember who's who. But this is, this is the housewife, the woman who's feeling the need to stay home and be happy with, with things the way that they are. And this is the piece that's the student who is interested in that finding purpose and meaning and I think there was another word you used to describe that woman who was the speaker, so that's her. And the piece of you that said, when you were crying earlier, that you felt maybe you were childish, can you name for me which, which piece that may be coming from before we do the homework? 

01:35:30
ANNIE That one. 

01:35:30
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT From her. So she's the one who's saying this is childish, this is a childish reaction. So the homework that I want to try with you is when you notice any of those kind of, maybe I'm being a "blank" where it's kind of a labelling thing, I'm just asking you to notice who it's coming from, and that's all for this first, this first bit of homework because I think even kind of catching those thoughts is a very first, first step for us in working forward. So I really believe that as we start to change those thoughts that are really hurting you inside and are causing you to stay in bed or not really know, you know, what decision you want to make, that if we can start to, to tease those apart a little bit and decide where these are coming from, and then decide for yourself which ones, which ways of thinking are the best for you? Which ways of thinking are the most empowering for you or the most in line with, with who you feel you are. So I think if we can just start naming where the thoughts are coming from, that's the first step. 

01:36:45
ANNIE Okay. 

01:36:45
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Does that make sense? 

01:36:45
ANNIE Yea, it does. That's simple enough. 

01:36:50
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Yea, so just a quick note in your head, you know, you don't even have to write it down, but then next time we meet, I'm going to ask you if you remember any examples. 

01:37:00
ANNIE Okay. 

01:37:00
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT And then we're just going to start looking at maybe a little bit of a pattern next time. 

01:37:05
ANNIE Okay. 

01:37:05
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Okay. 

01:37:05
ANNIE Okay. 

01:37:05
KATHERINE NORDELL FORT Great. Thank you. 

01:37:10

01:37:10
5 "Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy. The Cognitive/Behavioral Counseling Session 

01:37:10
Processing the 5 Approaches to Psychology with the Client. Manivong J. Ratts, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Seattle University and Annie, the client. 

01:37:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS Hi Annie, how are you? 

01:37:35
ANNIE Hi Vong, good, thanks, and you? 

01:37:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS I'm really good, thank you. Well, I just want to say thank you for being able to work with each of our 5 therapists. You've had an opportunity to work with Dr. Sheri Hunt, who was really operating from a psychoanalytic perspective, Katherine Nordell, who was working as a CBT therapist, demonstrating elements of CBT, and you also had an opportunity to work with Steven Scheutz, who worked from an existential/humanistic paradigm, Dr. Agnes Kwong, who was working from a multicultural framework and then the last therapist you worked with was Dr. Michael Hutchins, who was operating from a social justice framework. 

01:38:20
ANNIE Right, yea. 

01:38:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS And what I wanted to do today was just spend some time with you, just sort of process each of those sessions and if, just sort of hear from you in terms of what you like, didn't like about your work with each of the therapists and what resonated with you. Is that okay? 

01:38:40
ANNIE Yea, yea. 

01:38:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS If we can start with the psychoanalytic perspective, that was the first therapist you worked with, Dr. Sheri Hunt, what was your experience like as a client working with her, if you can share a little bit. 

01:38:55
ANNIE It felt really enlightening. You know, when I was telling a story, she just drew so many connections from my childhood and how that plays out into how I'm currently acting. So in that moment when I was sitting with her, she made so much sense and it felt very, like yes, yes, yes, you know. Everything she says makes so much sense, and it felt there was such a groove going on. It felt, it felt really enlightening. 

01:39:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS Sounds like really, like you were gaining a lot of insight. 

01:39:35
ANNIE Right, right, but then after, after the session and having time to think about it and process it, I felt very, I felt like I couldn't really say no because the connections she was making make so much sense. But then it just felt a bit, it just felt, 'cause it made so much sense but it didn't feel pinpoint, make sense? 

01:40:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS Help me understand that. 

01:40:15
ANNIE Yea, the connections she made just made a lot of sense. However, when I went home and processed it, I'm like well, it could have been this. It could have been that. So I feel like the conclusions were kind of assumed but not, maybe not accurate. Does that make sense? But at the moment, when I was with her, it made a lot of sense. You know, so it was really, it was really enlightening, but it, I do wonder about the accuracy of it. 

01:40:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay. 

01:40:50
ANNIE Yea, and she just seemed so knowledgeable. 

01:40:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yea. 

01:40:55
ANNIE that is was kind of hard to, no, I don't know, but she seemed so knowledgeable and she was drawing so many connections and so fast. And as I was telling these stories I was very, there was a lot of stuff going on inside, you know. So it just felt like, it just made sense, everything she connected, and I couldn't sit down and filter it and process her connections. But at the moment, it felt like the flow was so good, so it just felt like yes, yes, yes. 

01:41:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yea it sounds like what I hear you saying is you really connected with her in the session. You liked the insight she was giving you 

01:41:35
ANNIE Right. 

01:41:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS Because it made a lot of sense, logical sense. 

01:41:35
ANNIE Right. 

01:41:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS in terms of connecting with your life story, if you will 

01:41:40
ANNIE Right. 

01:41:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS and I hear you saying also at the same time you liked her expertise and knowledge that she brought into the session. I'm also hearing you say in a sense you wonder if, if maybe needing more time is important to build a, make sure these connections she's making, these insights are accurate. 

01:42:05
ANNIE Right. 

01:42:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS If I'm hearing you correctly. 

01:42:05
ANNIE Yes. 

01:42:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS Once you went outside of the session and just had time to process it a little bit more. 

01:42:15
ANNIE Yea. 

01:42:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yea. 

01:42:15
ANNIE Right, yea. 

01:42:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS How about the cognitive/behavioral therapist Katherine Nordell? 

01:42:25
ANNIE Yea, I really felt like we had a really, I felt our relationship felt more equal 

01:42:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS Than the first one? 

01:42:30
ANNIE Right, with Dr. Hunt, yea. It felt more equal, but I felt like, she focused a lot on of course, on my thoughts and my feelings and it, I didn't feel as listened to. It just felt like there was sort of a pattern or path she wanted to drive me to, 'cause I felt that my story is much more and it felt, it felt kind of narrow. 

01:43:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay, okay. It sounds like what you're saying is that she had a direction that she wanted to take you. 

01:43:10
ANNIE Right, right. 

01:43:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS And that felt limiting. 

01:43:15
ANNIE Right. 

01:43:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS But at the same time, I'm hearing you say you felt the relationship was more egalitarian. 

01:43:20
ANNIE Right. 

01:43:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS You were equals in, in your work together if you will, compared to with Dr. Hunt. 

01:43:30
ANNIE Right. 

01:43:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yea, yea, okay. Anything else you like about your work with Nordell, Katherine Nordell? 

01:43:40
ANNIE Yea, I just think we had a really great rapport I think. I really trusted her. Yea, I think that's the thing that sticks out the most, the rapport we had with each other and I felt, yea, I just felt it was really equal. 

01:43:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay. 

01:43:55
ANNIE Yea. 

01:43:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS How about with Steven Scheutz, the therapist who was operating from an existential/ humanistic paradigm, kind of what was your, that experience like for you? 

01:44:05
ANNIE I felt kind of confused with the whole experience 'cause the questions he asked to me didn't make much sense for me to do some things, and I felt like it was about me being me, and I understand that therapy is about me but there are so many other things going on like my family, my husband, that to focus only on me and not bring them into the equation, I felt kind of silly, I mean, not silly but yea, it wasn't, it just wasn't, because I can't just think about me. You know, I can't just focus on me. There are other people you know near me, so it felt like, it felt like he couldn't really relate to what I was going through. I remember the one, the one question about, if I'm going to get the, the slushee question, you know I feel like that's not, that's not me. That's not what I would do, and it seemed a bit strange to ask that question. It didn't seem kind of relevant, so yea, but however, I did like, I think it was him, when he said you know, this is a safe space for you, for you to feel you, say what you want and feel your emotions, 'cause I think he was the one who said that. Yea, so I really appreciated that, 'cause I didn't realize that that is what this space is for. 

01:45:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS So you like that he was able to set the tone for you. 

01:45:45
ANNIE Yea. 

01:45:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS But I also hear you saying that one of the limitations that you sort of had was you didn't feel like he truly connected with you. 

01:45:55
ANNIE Right, right. 

01:45:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS or really understood you as an Asian American in terms of just looking at your family dynamics and focusing more so on sort of focusing you as an individual. 

01:46:10
ANNIE Right, yea, right. 

01:46:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS Which I'm hearing you say is a limited perspective of who you are. 

01:46:15
ANNIE Right, right. 

01:46:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS in relation to your experience. 

01:46:15
ANNIE It felt very western. Yea, it felt really western. 

01:46:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS It's interesting because with Katherine you were talking about how it seemed like there was more direction or she kind of knew where she was going and there was a logical sequence 

01:46:35
ANNIE Yes. 

01:46:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS In terms of her work with you and with Steven, what I'm hearing you say if I'm hearing you correctly is that there wasn't necessarily that logical progression of, of what you were doing. 

01:46:50
ANNIE Right. 

01:46:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS Is that what, did you feel that? 

01:46:50
ANNIE Yea, it felt very much like bouncing back and forth. 

01:46:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay. 

01:46:55
ANNIE The questions that were asked, 'cause I know there was some frustration 'cause the way my, I answered the question, I couldn't answer the question the way the he wanted me to answer it, so I could sense that he was kind of frustrated because I couldn't see what he was wanting me to see. So I felt he was repeating a lot of things, repeating a question a different way just to sort of get me to an answer that he wants me to see. Yea, so it didn't feel logical. It just felt sort of circular and like a tennis ball back and forth, back and forth. 

01:47:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yea, yea. 

01:47:30
ANNIE So. 

01:47:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS Which is interesting because existential/humanistic theorists and practitioners tend to be, are known to be directionless, in terms of just non-directive 

01:47:45
ANNIE Right, yea. 

01:47:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS And the approach in cognitive/behaviorists tend to be a little bit more structured in their work with clients, and it's interesting that you're pointing that out for 

01:47:55
ANNIE Oh all right. 

01:47:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS or that you're experiencing that. 

01:48:00
ANNIE Oh cool. 

01:48:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS So, how about with Dr. Agnes Kwong, the multicultural therapist? 

01:48:05
ANNIE I honestly must say that I felt the most listened to with her. I felt the pacing was equal. I just, the pacing was really good, I just felt really listened to, and I felt like she had no agenda and she just listened. So yea, I think the pacing 

01:48:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS What were things she was doing that made you feel connected or that you were feeling listened to? Were there things in the session that was happening? 

01:48:40
ANNIE I think a lot of it was body language, you know, yea, it's just maybe the way that she says mm-hmm, you know. I can't pinpoint, I can't remember any exact phrases. 

01:48:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yea. 

01:48:55
ANNIE but just I just felt listened to. Just her simple verbal and facial responses. Yea, I felt really listened to with that, with her. Yea. 

01:49:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS Did you feel that her racial identity sort of helped in terms of you connecting with her, or have any influence with your ability to connect with her, the fact that you are both Asian females? 

01:49:30
ANNIE I think maybe but I'm not quite sure, because I feel, I felt more equal with Katherine in terms of like just personality and just equal, but with Nancy, with Dr. Kwong, she felt a little bit more knowledgeable than I am, but still there's still that sense of like, caring I guess. So I don't know exactly what it is that made me feel that way with her. I'm not quite sure if it is our similar cultural identity. 

01:50:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yea, yea. 

01:50:10
ANNIE I'm not quite sure. 

01:50:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay, okay, what was your experience like with Dr. Michael Hutchins, who was really operating from a social justice framework and did something a little bit different? 

01:50:20
ANNIE Right. 

01:50:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS than the other therapists. 

01:50:20
ANNIE Yea, he did stuff I didn't know that counseling do. And I like that he thought out of the box and helped me you know, find resources and other options. So that part I really like because I saw a bigger picture of what counseling can do, but similar to CBT, it felt very directed. I just felt I was answering questions back and forth, back and forth, like I was just constantly answering questions. I didn't feel like, I didn't feel like he really knew me. I just felt like I just kept answering the questions that he had for me. 

01:51:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yea, well now that you've had the opportunity to work with all five therapists, if there was a therapist you were going to continue working with, who might that be? 

01:51:15
ANNIE I think personally, I think I am a better fit with Dr. Kwong, and perhaps it is because we're the same, same culture, background. I just felt, it's the fact that I felt really listened to. I felt like she really saw me and she heard me. I felt like she didn't rush me, and I think that the directions the other counselors went, I think if I had more time with her, she would have gone those directions also, and it was only a first session. Yea, so I like to think that if we had more time, we would have gone, 'cause she did ask a bit about my childhood like Dr. Hunt, and she did ask me about stuff I was thinking and feeling like Katherine. Yea, so 

01:52:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS So she kind of brought elements of other theories, you felt, in your work with her. 

01:52:20
ANNIE Right, right. 

01:52:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS or in her work with you. 

01:52:25
ANNIE Right. 

01:52:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS She had a little bit of everything. 

01:52:25
ANNIE I think so. 

01:52:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS And then that cultural piece, it sounds like it was important for you. 

01:52:30
ANNIE Yea, yea, yea. So and it was only one session so I think that more sessions, we could have gotten all the other stuff out perhaps. But yea, the most important thing, I just felt really listened to. 

01:52:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS Well, I just want to thank you for your time and for giving of yourself and sharing your experiences with each of the therapists. I really appreciate it, and I know students who watch this video will as well, so thank you. 

01:53:00
ANNIE Great. You're welcome.
