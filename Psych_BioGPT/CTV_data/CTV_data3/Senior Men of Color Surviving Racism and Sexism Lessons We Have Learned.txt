DERALD WING SUE This is a program called "Honoring ah, Senior Men of Color". Ah, at the 1999 National Multicultural Conference and Summit, we honored four senior women of color ah, doctors Caroline Attneave, Martha Bernal, Carolyn Payton, and Reiko True. They shared with us their struggles as women with color in a field and society not known for its sensitivity to racial ethnic or gender equity issues. This was one of the most moving events of the summit as they shared with us their life stories in a manner that made us not only laugh and cry, but revealed the courage and commitment that they had to overcoming racism and sexism. Those in attendance were really truly transfixed by their words and all of us knew that day that something magical had happened. Brothers and sisters, I am honored this morning to be standing in the presence of four of the most distinguished men of color that our profession has known. Arthur Leroy McDonald, K. Patrick Okura, Amado M. Padilla, and Joseph L. White.

DERALD WING SUE  In our profession and society, we too often measure a person's worth by credentials they hold, awards they have received, and the number of publications in their vitae, and/or the number of important offices that they have held in professional organizations. Art, Pat, Amado, and Jo, by these criteria alone, all of you would be considered exceptional individuals. But these are only external manifestations of the persons you are and have become.In addition to professional contributions, people of color know that our worth is derived from the collective relationship we share with our people and that we are people of emotions, intuitions, and spirituality. Your work and lives remind us that a psychology that fails to recognize this aspect of the human condition is a discipline that is spiritually and emotionally bankrupt. 

00:03:00
DERALD WING SUE Today, we honor you as human beings, not from the generic definition too often used by the society, to dilute our identities, but one rooted in your racial cultural heritage and being. Native American, American-Indian, Asian-American, Pacific Islander, Latino, Latina- American, Hispanic-American, and Black African-American. Throughout their lives, these four brothers have given up themselves in the pursuit of social justice, fairness, inclusion, and equal access and opportunity to all groups in our society. Today, we honor four colleagues whose entire professional and personal career most exemplifies the vision and values of multiculturalism in the educational service, research practice, and personal domains. Art, Pat, Amado, and Jo, I have known all of you for some time, and what a pleasure it is to have this opportunity to tell you how much we have admired your work and more importantly your essence and being. All of you are true pioneers and giants in the field whose work has touched the hearts and souls of those around you. While the formal title is honoring senior men of color, in actuality, you honor us by your presence here this morning. Your work on racial ethnic minority issues has contributed immensely not only to your own groups, but to all groups in our society. 

00:04:35
DERALD WING SUE  As I have gotten older, I have come to appreciate the Herculean struggle that pioneers like you must have had to endure. You dealt with a profession that not only must have invalidated your work on multiculturalism until they saw the error of their ways, but one that also invalidated you as a racial cultural being. Having survived that journey, change the way our profession views multiculturalism and blaze the path for us to follow. Many of us would appreciate having you share yourselves with us this morning. So, what I would like to do is uhm, ah, ask and introduce each of the individuals, have them come up and speak for a brief period of time, and, uhm, let me say that this is going to be a difficult thing to do to have this group of, of men speak for a brief period of time. Last night, I approached uhm, ah, Art McDonald and he said, "How much time do I have?" And I said, "Between 5 and 10 minutes," and his comment was that, "Put me at the end so I won't use all the time by the others." I go to Amado and I say, "Amado, you have 5 to 10 minutes." He said, "But I've got a 20-minute paper here ah, that I'm got to read." And then I talked to ah, Jo White that, "You have 5 to 10 minutes," and he says, "Ten plus". And I, I see ah, ah, Pat sitting in a restaurant, I stop by and, and talk to Pat very briefly, and I said that, "You have 5 to 10 minutes, Pat", and he leans back. That's fine, but you know, I could read his mind. It was saying, "Derald, time is unimportant." "Time, time is not static. It's flowing and harmonious," and I say, "Oh my goodness!" 

00:06:35
[sil.] 

00:06:35
DERALD WING SUE  So let me introduce ah, ah, the first ah, ah, individual, ah, Art, who, uhm, I've known for some time but when he became ah, quite aware of the ah, knowledge that he really has about ah, indigenous cultures, about uhm, spirituality. I think that you and I, ah, ah, last year at APA, had listened to Joe Trembo's presidential address on spirituality. You must have noted that I was wrestling and was trying to understand what this was all about, and you stopped me at the Hyatt, ah, where in the hallway, we carried on about a 20 to ah, 30-minute conversation. I just wanted, ah, ah, thank you Art for nudging me onto the right path ah, so that I could get some idea of what spirituality ah, truly means. 

00:07:25
DERALD WING SUE Dr. Arthur Leroy McDonald is Professor of Psychology at Dull Knife Memorial College. He was born in Merton, South Dakota on the Byne, Pine Ridge Reservation in 1934. The oldest of five children, he attended the Bureau of Indian Affairs Boarding School ah, where, which was a one-room classroom on the reservation. He joined the United States Marine Corps for a period of 3 years. Just over 2 years were spent overseas in Korea and Japan. After his honorable discharge from the Marines, he attended the University of New Mexico and the University of South Dakota where he obtained his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. Dr. McDonald accepted a position at the Montana State University in 1966, was appointed department head of stayed until '72 when he returned to the reservation in Montana. For many years, Dr. McDonald was the only doctor- level psychologist actually living and working on an Indian reservation. His contributions to our understanding of the American-Indian experience come not from his professional works solely, but also his immense personal and spiritual presence. On a personal note, tomorrow will mark the 41st, is it the 41st or 21st? 41st anniversary of his marriage to Rita Reese-McDonald. Dr. McDonald is the father of three children: Forest(ph), a painter living in Edgemont, South Dakota; Carla, a licensed clinical counselor still at home and practicing on the reservation; and Justin Douglas ah, who led us in the opening ceremony ah, ah, today and is also a clinical psychologist at the University of North Dakota. Art states quote, "These three along with my students are the major accomplishments of my career". Dr. Arthur McDonald.

00:09:30
ARTHUR MCDONALD  Thank you. Look at those faces. They know they haven't got a chance for over about two or three minutes of quick introduction (laughs). Bring me all the way out here for five or ten minutes just isn't gonna happen. 

00:09:55
[sil.] 

00:09:55
ARTHUR MCDONALD  See how nervous he's getting. No, I won't do that to you. Ah, you've been too good a friend. I do wanna ah, share with you a number of things and uhm, on a serious note, I think that at this point in my career, that there are several uhm, ah, conclusions that I've, I'm coming to and one of them I'm reminded of the an old ballad by Tom T. Hall, that nothing important in this world but old dogs, and children, and watermelon wine. Ah, my grandkids are, are what gives me the uhm, ah, real sense of satisfaction to go on in this field. Uhm, it also gives me a great sense of uhm, concern because I don't know that things have uhm, ah, gotten so good because of people like these ah, that the younger people can continue and get my grandchildren through school and through life uhm, the way I did. 

00:11:20
ARTHUR MCDONALD  Uhm, in terms of, that's the purpose of life. The purpose basically being that, that elders finally gain enough wisdom to become teachers and in the society, I mean that makes total sense to the people that, in this room but in the society we're in. If you reach that point, you get your uhm, uhm, social security check and the expectation is that you will shut your mouth, go home, and not be around. Just at that time of your life where you have accumulated enough experience to have a perspective that the young doers in this world uhm, don't have. They don't have that experience. They cannot make their ah, research and pronouncements based on wisdom, and I think that uhm, uhm, this is the, the best. This is the best group of people that can get that message across and especially to the academic world, that they must listen to the elders. 

00:12:50
ARTHUR MCDONALD I was going to talk more about uhm, issues of, of uhm, racism that I think are, are, that are more damaging and thus more challenging for this group. I was just absolutely blown away by Dr. Steel's(ph) discussions of the processes of stereotyping and, you know, it, it uhm, is so very, very, very true that the stereotyping, the damage that can be done with that kind of classification and system with, with young minority people that's just uhm, I just, my, I, I completely changed what I was going to say. I'm watching. Ah, let me summarize my, my feelings and so forth with a quick summary of what happened in my own case. Born and raised on the reservation in 1951 our uhm, uhm, high school had just gone through four years of uhm, football which we had lost one game. My last year, ah, we had undefeated and ranked number one in the state, and as a, uhm, uhm, reward for that, the city fathers took us to a little restaurant in Philip, South Dakota after we had won the ah, final game and bought us food, and sitting in the booth and ah, behind the city fathers, they were sitting and discussing and I heard one of the most damaging, damaging personal ah, stories that I'd ever heard ever because I thought we were pretty hot stuff. And on the team, there were four Indians and the rest were, were white but those four Indians were sitting in that booth together and, uhm, out of the five all-state ah, selections that were made, five of them were on our team; four of us were Indian, one white. And the five of us had receives scholarship to a variety of different colleges, and we thought that was pretty impressive too. But we listened to all of these accolades about what we'd done and how well we'd done and so forth, and then one of the city fathers who would also happened to be the mayor said, "Well, but you know so on, so on, so on, Art, they're all Indian and it will show. They will not make it. They will not make it through college and their football scholarship". And I was really, really crushed, but you know he was right. None of us survived the first year, not because we were Indians, not because we weren't good enough as far as football players, but now I understand the stereotype, the expectation that because we were Indians, because we were from the reservation, we wouldn't make it. And, you know, the, the upside of that story, I, we were back for ah, ah, ah, a reunion this past summer, and ah, my cousin, Bill who is retired now, he had his own trucking firm. He didn't get through college but he, he did pretty well. He's retired and ah, better ah, than me. He doesn't even have to have a job anymore, but, ah, you know. To half back, he didn't get through college either, but he does have either the largest or the second largest cattle ranch they have in the, the, on the reservation, doing well. The other one uhm, just got elected state senator. Uhm, you know, I'm still looking for my first honest job, but you know, I still have a little time. Ah. 

00:17:40
PATRICK OKURA, M.A. You have lots of time. 

00:17:40
ARTHUR MCDONALD  And, my friend Pat said, "You have lots of time". That indicates, you know, he thinks I'm just ready to start my second career. But, uhm, okay. I think that the largest, the greatest challenge to this group is not the kind of personal hurt and uhm, uhm, damage that is done. I think that the, the kinds of motivation and the courage when, when those kinds of events happened uhm, with time can, can create the drive and the push to become as good as you can be and, and just a little bit better. Uhm, I feel that that kind of, of racism that was exhibited probably not going to change. What our challenge is, is try to find ways to turn that motivation into a positive force to make them be much better than they can be. 

00:19:00
ARTHUR MCDONALD The other issue that I think is a tremendous challenge for people of color that are, that impact the university system that are working with the new children that, that we're bringing in into the field is the institutional racism that exists. That is far more difficult to deal with and very quickly, the tribalistic structure of academia, uhm, uhm, has to be changed enough. I don't think it can be changed a lot, but it has to be changed enough so that we'd finally start looking at people and values and value systems such as cultures and so forth in the horizontal way not a vertical way. And by that I mean as, ah, ah, as Claude Steel says, you know, it gets into the, the uhm, structure of the, of academia and finds that College of Arts and Sciences is structured in a way ah, ah, that's a little bit higher than the College of Education, but less than the College of Engineering. And if you're in Montana much less than the College of Agriculture and so on and so forth. You get into, within the College of Arts and Sciences and then you have those divisions of, of departments and the Department of Mathematics, Physics, Cemistry, etc. And somewhere in the middle is psychology and way down there is theology, philosophy, music. Those kinds of, of things placing and, and ascribing value to those particular structures horizontally is deadly. That kind of institutional racism needs to be changed; otherwise, we prepare our, our children to go into the field, academic field and we don't prepare them for the institutional racism that exists. We only deal with some of the, the racial stereotyping. They will not be prepared and uhm, uhm, I don't know how to do that because I'm not an academian. So I've passed that onto all of you people here that are in academia, and then I don't have to worry about it anymore, and I just want to say thank you to all of you. Some of you I have known for so long, and I obviously don't belong up here not because of my qualifications, but just because I am so much younger than all the rest of you. 

00:22:15
[sil.] 

00:22:15
ARTHUR MCDONALD Well, thank you. 

00:22:25
[sil.] 

00:22:25
DERALD WING SUE  Now, uhm, what I wanna say is that before Dix Wen, before Robert Chen, and even before Stan Sue, there was K. Patrick Okura. A true pioneer and giant in the field. I need, Pat, how old are you now? 

00:22:55
PATRICK OKURA, M.A. 89. I'll be 90 this year. 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:00
DERALD WING SUE  You know, I, I have no embarrassment asking Pat his age because in Asian culture, age is respected and revered unlike some of my Euro-American brothers and sisters. Uhm, ah, actually, I have committed a blunder that I need to ask ah, ah, your forgiveness that ah, being the eldest, you should have gone first. Ah, I did this order which is alphabetical primarily because uhm, I didn't want people to accuse me of favoritism by having ah, Pat go first, and secondarily, I was scared to death to ask Amado how old he is. Uhm, you know (laughs). 

00:23:45
[sil.] 

00:23:45
DERALD WING SUE Okay. Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, K. Patrick Okura held a Master's degree in Psychology when he and his wife, Lilly and thousands of other Japanese-Americans on the west coast were interned in 1942 by the signing of Executive Order 9006. After being incarcerated for nine months, Pat Okura was hired by Father Flanagan's Boys' Town as a psychologist. This experience motivated him to help Asian Pacific-Americans overcome the obstacles of racism. Pat Okura went on to distinguish himself as the first Asian-American to serve on the executive level with the National Institute of Mental Health. At NIMH, Pat helped numerous Asian organizations secure their first federal contracts. He went on to serve as assistant director for International Mental Health Programs at NIMH. The vice president of the Institute for New Challenges in Washington, D.C., special assistant to Hannaman University in Philadelphia and founder of the National Asian Pacific American Families Against Substance Abuse. In 1988, Patrick and Lilly Okura founded the Okura Mental Health Leadership Foundation that gives fellowships to promising Asian-Americans in the mental health field. It's an honor to present my ah, brother, ah, Pat Okura. 

00:25:10
Patrick Okura, M.A. 

00:25:10
PATRICK OKURA, M.A.  Thank you, Derald. It's an honor to be here today and to tell you a little about how I was able to overcome some of the obstacles that I found in my life, the last 89 years about racism, about being rejected because you happen to look different, because you come from a different culture, etc. Well, I learned that it's not how smart you are, how knowledgeable you are, but it's, you have to depend on other people to be of help to you. You have to cultivate the right people at the right time, in the right place and that's what, in that way, I was able to succeed in some of the things I've been, ah, able to do. 

00:26:25
PATRICK OKURA, M.A. As a youngster in the '20s going to high school, I found little, very little prejudice or racism. I was voted the outstanding student, the outstanding athlete when I graduated in 1928, then I went on to UCLA because I thought, "Well, if you get an education ah, and you get to be, ah, have a degree that you'll be accepted accordingly". Well, that was the biggest mistake or the biggest ah, under, misunderstanding I had because I went to UCLA and they said, "Oh! You're Japanese-American. I'm sorry. You can't live in Westwood Village. There's a restrictive covenant. You have to go 10 miles away where there's a Japanese group of gardeners and you can live there but you can live on the campus". Then I go; entered school. "You can't belong to any organized, ah, organization on the campus. You can't belong to any fraternities, sororities, this, that, or the other thing." 

00:27:30
PATRICK OKURA, M.A. So then I thought, "Well, I'm a pretty good baseball player and my ambition was to be the first Japanese-American Major League Baseball player. So I go out for baseball." They said, "Are you a Sigma Nu?" I said, "What the hell is a Sigma Nu?" "Well, that's the baseball fraternity." Well, they knew I couldn't belong to any fraternity so ah, they said, "Well, can you play second base?" "Oh! I can play anything you want me to play." So I went out for second base. At least, we had a fair coach and a fair trainer, so I go out for second base. I made my first freshmen numerals(ph) and I went out for varsity and the coach says, "We're gonna play the nine best men." So it ends up, that nine of us are chosen, seven whites, I'm an Asian, and the ninth person was a Jewish-American. 

00:28:35
PATRICK OKURA, M.A. So all during the two years I'd played, the battle cry of the, our team mates, "We got to get rid of that Japan and that Jew. We got to make this an all Sigma Nu team or, or all white team." And I thought, "Wow! This, this is what I go to college for? This is what I'm supposed to, ah, represent?" So, but the coach and the trainer were the two that kept me going. The trainer said every night I'd come in and he'd give me a rub down and he says, "Don't quit. Don't let them drive you out. Stay in there. You're good as anybody else" and so on, so. But then, I went into psychology, and fortunate, I met some great psychologists. Dr. Grace, first of all Dr. Shepard Ivory Franz who's the chairman of the department. Then I met Dr. Grace Fernald, child psychology, psychologist, Dr. Alan B. Solomon from Stanford who was ah, in charge of one of, ah, the divisions in the Department of Psych. 

00:29:40
PATRICK OKURA, M.A.  These three people were the people that helped me start my career in psychology. If it wasn't for them, I still be probably battling ah, in Los Angeles ah, the racism that existed at that time, but they convinced me that I should not only major in psychology, but it was the first year they started ah, graduate school, 1934. Art said he was born in 1934. I'm old enough to be his father. Ah, but in '34 I started graduate school, '35 there were five of us in that very first class of graduate school at UCLA. So I got my master's and I thought, "Well, with the master degree maybe I could find a job." Fortunately, those three people especially Dr. Fernald and Dr. Solomon were the ones that found me and insisted that I go into research. So they found and through their influence, I was able to obtain a research assistant job with the County and City of Los Angeles. 

00:30:55
PATRICK OKURA, M.A. That started me on my career. Then in 1937, I ah, joined the Los Angeles City Civil Service Department as the personnel technician. Well, talk about racism, the first examination I handled everybody that flunked the examination, there were 300 applicants, about 200 flunked, there was only about a hundred that passed, but the 200 wrote letters and telephone calls to the Civil Service Commission. Their ah, reason for failing the exam was that technician that you had give the examination couldn't speak English, and we didn't understand the directions, etc., etc., so that's why we flunked. But I got that for the first year. Everybody that failed in the examination felt that since I was non-white and that my English was so poor that they used that excuse for failing their examination. So I went all through that for four or five years, and then 1941 comes along. I decided that in October, '41 that I had to started my career. I was making fairly decent money in those days and I decided to get married. Well, I got married in October, '41. Lo and behold, what happens in December, '41. Pearl Harbor comes along. 

00:32:25
PATRICK OKURA, M.A. In March of '42, I find myself living in a horse stable at Santa Anita Race Track. So that was the biggest blow that I ever faced and I thought, "Well, boy life is, is really rough." But it's interesting to look back and see that some of the worst things that happened to you can turn out to be somewhat of a blessing in disguise. Now I know a lot of my Japanese-American friends will say that, "Ah, you're crazy. You know, that's the worst thing that ever happened to our group. 120,000 of us just because we happened to be born of 1/16th Japanese blood, we were interned and this whole matter was based on racism." Well, sure those were the facts, but I found that depending on who you knew, and what, where you were at the time, your whole life can be changed. 

00:33:25
PATRICK OKURA, M.A. I went in to Santa Anita. I refused to do anything. I was so ah, mad, full of rage, and so on, but my psychological background was able to get me over that, and of all things, my wife happened to be working for a man who ran the ah, the recreation and the ah, education program within the camp of 19,000 of us and he happened to be a devout Catholic. He happened to be a graduate at Notre Dame and he had connections with Father Flanagan at Boys' Town. So here, he helped six families to get out of camp and go work as skilled tradesmen at Boys' Town and then his, the letter he wrote to Father Flanagan was, "There are two other people I wanna help, my secretary Lilly Okura and her husband who happens to be a psychologist." So he says, "Have them write to me and give me their backgrounds." So I gave, wrote a letter. The next week, I get back in the camp, I get a letter from Father Flanagan. "Oh! We don't have a psychologist. We have 400 kids that have never been tested and so on and so forth. So we, we can use you. Ah, you cannot only test all of our kids, but you can be a counselor to them and so on, and your wife can work as your secretary and so on." Well here, un, under such ah, restraints of being held in a concentration camp, U.S.A. style I call it. Ah, we're given this opportunity. 

00:35:00
PATRICK OKURA, M.A.  So in October of '42, way before the, the 120 other thousand people who were interned were able to work their way out, here, in October just after eight months of being interned, I was able to get to Boys' Town and again Father Flanagan was, was a saint in my mind because through his efforts, I was able to heal all of the, the anger ah, that I had in my system and through the work that he did for unwanted kids, I learned that this is what life's all about: helping other people who are less fortunate. So my whole life changed, and since then, my whole philosophy is, has been to help others, and it takes people to help others. 

00:35:50
PATRICK OKURA, M.A. Ah, following my 18 years at Boys' Town, I was offered a job as a chief probation officer of juvenile court because I complained about the court system. How they were treating kids, locking them up in jail until they could find a judge that would listen to them. So we started to move in Nebraska. I headed up a committee that ah, made three, four hundred speeches in two years to set up a separate juvenile court in the state of Nebraska. They didn't have one. So ah, two years later, we had a separate juvenile court, but only limited to two communities, Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska because you had to have a population of 50,000 people or, or you could not, you were not eligible for a separate juvenile court. Well that ah, work ended up with me being appointed a chief probation officer so I spent six years there. Then we got a judge that I couldn't agree with and I am a type of a person that if I don't have confidence in the, I don't have faith in the people I'm working with, I, I just won't work. So I quit my job, decided to go back to California, and tried to straighten out California in, (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
DERALD SUE Yeah. 

00:37:00
PATRICK OKURA, M.A.  but ah, that never happened. 

00:37:05
PATRICK OKURA, M.A.  Ah, I got a call immediately, and at that time, they wondered why I was resigning from a job that I had been so successful at and so on. And I said, "Well, I can't stand the judge that's just anti, ah, children and anti-this and ah, I simply won't work for anyone like that." Well, lo and behold, I get this call from the Nebraska Psychiatric Institute. Dr. Whitson called me and said, " Don't take another job. We need you. I have an opening that I wanna talk to you about. We need a state planner for mental health for the state of Nebraska. The federal government's gonna give us some money if we come up with a state plan". So I went to work for the ah, NPI, the Nebraska Psychiatric Institute, and again, if it wasn't for Dr. Whitson, and if it hadn't been for the people that had some faith in my ability, I, I probably would have never become, ah, ended up as the ah, planner for the state of Nebraska. 

00:38:15
PATRICK OKURA, M.A. I wrote the state plan. The federal government liked it. They gave Nebraska the amount of money to set up six mental health centers. That caught the eye of Dr. Bertram S. Brown at NIMH who had just been made director, and he called me up one day and my secretary says, "Hey! Dr. Brown of NIMH was calling you. How do you know him?" And I said, "I don't know him. He certain, evidently heard of me." So I get on the phone and ah, he says, "I want you to come to Washington." I said, "I want no part of the federal government. They're the ones who put me behind barbed-wire fences and I don't trust the federal government so I don't even want to listen to what you have to offer. He said, "No, I need to talk to you." So we made an appointment. I went to Washington and I found out that there is there primary ah, goals were children, delinquency, and minorities. And I said, "Wow! You, as director, are willing to go to stick your neck out for those three areas". And he says, "Yes, I strongly believe that. You've been a minority all your life. You know all about children at Boys' Town and you know something about delinquency, so I need you here." So on that basis, I took a 3-year leave of absence from Nebraska and took the job. Well, that was when, you know, the fed, Bert Brown was considered a renegade, thinking of minorities for mi, ah, minority Asian, ah, mi, minority ah, groups in mental health and that was when I met Art Padilla and others and we started, with their help, all of the various programs on ah, minority mental health programs. 

00:40:10
PATRICK OKURA, M.A. Unfortunately, when the California pres, governor became president, he decided to go to state rights and wiped out all of those programs. Well, after 18 years of the federal system, I learned the insides and the outsides of, of, ah, how things are done. It's not how smart you are, it's not how much background you have, but it's, you got to know how the game is played, and you have to know the right people and have the right context. 

00:40:40
PATRICK OKURA, M.A. So that was when I decided to start this ah, Okura Mental Health Foundation. I received $20,000 dollars, my wife received $20,000 an apology from President Bush of our, of our internment and the mistake that the government had made in review, throwing out the Constitution and the interning 120,000 of us, of 70,000 being American citizens, and the rest were our parents who are ineligible for citizenship. So they could never become a citizen of our country at that time. Ah, not only that during the war, they were called, considered enemy aliens, ineligible for citizenship, and since we were children of enemy aliens, we were placed in that same category. That was why we ended up in these camps. Well, we took the $40,000 and I had enough money to match it with my own 40 and we started with $80,000 our Okura Mental Health Foundation. I felt that the best, the least I could do was give back to my community, give back to the minority communities the opportunity that I had and the people that helped me, that here I'm in the position, I could be of help to them. So, that's my philosophy and that's the road that I've taken for the last 10 years. We've had 10 every year. We've brought 90 people. We have an alumni group of 90 Okura fellows. Ah, my doctor tells me, I'll live another 10 years ah, so ah, I hope to hit a hundred, and by then, we'd have ah, another ah, hundred people so by the time I leave this earth, we'll have 200 Okura fellows that will be carrying on the work that I've been trying to do and instill in our younger Asian-Pacific American community. 

00:42:35
PATRICK OKURA, M.A. Ah, as I say, I didn't do this all on myself. Yeah, I had to have these kinds of people who are not only ah, interested in me and of, being of help, but I did have the sense to follow their dir, all of the mentors, the special assistants, all of the educators and the people that helped me. I had the sense to at least take their advice and that is why I'm able to able to stand here and tell you ah, of some of the successes that I've had in my life and, again, I, I know I ran over 10 minutes, but ah, I, I wanna thank the APA, the org, organize, organizers of this ah, symposium. And ah, ppreciate, and thank you again for the recognition. 

00:43:30

00:43:30
DERALD WING SUE, PH.D.  Our next honoree is Amado Padilla. Amado, you and I go clear back, don't we? We existed before ah, the office of Ethnic Minority Affairs, before the Minority Fellowship Program. In fact, I think uhm, we existed even before CEOP, the Committee for Equality of Opportunity in Psychology. I just wanna thank you personally for, actually, you may not believe this, but teaching me something about the Asian-American experience because by reading about the Hispanic experience it threw light in terms of what I was going through and ah, what Asian-Americans were as well. The other thing I do wanna say is that uhm, you and I have memories of Art Ruiz, uhm, also a true giant ah, in this field and I know Art is probably looking down proud of, of Amado and all of us right know. 

00:45:00
DERALD WING SUE, PH.D. Dr. Amado M. Padilla was born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He received his Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from the University of New Mexico. He has dedicated his career to teaching and is currently Professor of Psychological Studies and Education at Stanford University. His honors are too numerous to mention and his publications would constitute a book chapter in itself. Amado says, however, that he is proud of his books on Latino mental health, crossing culture and therapy, acculturation, Chicanos ethnicity, foreign language education, bilingual education, and Hispanic psychology. At Stanford University, he has chaired the Language, Learning, and Policy graduate program at the School of Education and teaches. He has combined his academic interests with highs, with local school activism and was elected to the board of education of the Palo Alto Unified School District in 1993. Currently, he is president of the local PTA where his son also attends high school, an honor that his adolescent son barely tolerates. Amado enjoys cooking, watching the History Channel on TV, and long runs, bike rides, and hikes with his friend and partner Debra(ph), who as a sixth grade teacher, who keeps him informed of what is happening in the real world of education. He also enjoys the company of members of a Friday morning life stories writing group that he has been involved in for the past several years, where he is proud to say he is the youngest member. Amado.

Amado Padilla, Ph.D. 

00:46:45
AMADO PADILLA, PH.D.  This is indeed an honor and one that I just wanna thank everybody who had anything to do with this ah, for this honor. So, it's always much nicer receiving award when you can get up and you get it, you know, ah, and, and be able to walk to the podium. Uhm, I'm gonna try to be, and actually I hope I can get up when I'm 90 years old like Pat so that you have it's a real ah, a real sense of, ah, of encouragement to see that Pat is still very active at a very young age. Ah, Derald asked how old I am and I'm 58 years old, Derald. 

00:47:30
AMADO PADILLA, PH.D. Ah, Let me tell you a little bit about my background, and then to just kind of say a few things about that and give you some sense of the kinds of things that I've, I experienced. I don't wanna get into issues of individual personal issues of ah, racism. I believe that probably about the age of 12 or 30, I become pretty sensitive to issues of racism and one of the ways in which I was protecting myself by that was to draw, join a local gang for the purposes of protection from ah, some issues that were going on in the community that I grew up in. I also believed at that time that one of the other ways that I could protect myself was becoming the best student I possibly could be, which was very difficult because I did not have a history in my family of ah, of ah, academics, or intellectualism, or anything to that, to that effect. 

00:48:15
AMADO PADILLA, PH.D.  To make a long story short, ah, I'm gonna talk primarily about institutional racism and surviving ah, professional ah, racism. I received my Ph.D. in 1968 at the age of 25, and I will tell you right now, I hated graduate school. Graduate school was not fun. I wanted to get out of graduate school as, as rapidly as possible. However, there was a war in Vietnam going on and I hated the idea of getting drafted even worse than graduate school. So I kicked around after completing my Ph.D. I kicked around for a couple of years doing ah, some different things, and in fact, Santa Barbara has a very special meaning for me. I came to Santa Barbara in about ah, January of 1971 to interview for a job ah, here at UC Santa Barbara, and was ah, ah, appointed to a position ah, here at a, at a UCSB. So I came to Santa Barbara in 1971, in September of 1971, but let me digress just a bit. Through my academic training as an experimental psychologist at the University of New Mexico, throughout that entire training, I never ever met a Latino or other minority psychologist. I never even had any coursework or any inkling, not even a paragraph of issues of minority ah, concerns in psychology; just did not happen. It was not there. 

00:49:45
AMADO PADILLA, PH.D.  I didn't meet my first professional ah, until 19, about(ph) I guess it was about 1970 or late '70, early '71 when in fact I met Rene Art Ruiz who Derald mentioned, who was a full Professor of clinical, of Clinical Psychology at the University of Missouri I believe. And we struck it off very, very quickly, he and I, and ultimately he became my mentor for a period of 10 years. And we had a working relationship that was very productive through the period 1971 through 1982 ah, when he passed away unexpectedly. But as a mentor and the first mentor I'd ever had academically, who, there were many, many things that he taught me about. Few of them had to do initially with psychology. He thought me for instance, about fine wines and brandy, and savory food, all of which I really did not know anything about. He also taught me about the utility of professional expenses for income tax reduction purposes. He taught me about investment planning and how to spend discretionary money which literally I was feeling like I was beginning to have. That was very important. But most importantly he began, he gave me a perspective on how to value multiculturalism and the need to situate my research within the parameters of culture, of culture, social class, and ethnicity. 

00:51:15
AMADO PADILLA, PH.D. Now remember, I was an experimental psychologist. I actually started out doing operant conditioning, working with rats in, in a laboratory. After my move to Santa Barbara in 1971, several things happened. One, didn't know a thing about ah, Latino psychology or Chicano psychology in, in those days, and I had to retool myself and I'd had to do a self, there were no post-doctorals on these kinds of things. I learned ah, through just hit and miss, what it, you know, about the, the multicultural experience of Latinos. Ah, I began to teach a course with some, ah, with a historian and a person in literature that was called something to the effect of ah, the Introduction to Chicano Studies and it was actually in that course, I learned a lot about ah, Franz, from(ph) ah, ah, Fanon Fran, Franz and the, and I(ph) just all kinds of things about oppression and, you know, and racism that, that really my, my graduate training had not at all sensitized me to. I also taught a class in the Psychology of a Chicano Child which again I did know a thing about, and I began to put together ah, that ah, that ah, that knowledge through the self study ah, course. Santa Barbara also in those days was a wonderful place to live. Not more than half a mile from here and I, I went jogging this morning and kind of relived a lot of experiences. Not more than about half a mile from here, was a wonderful nude beach that, you know, as a, as a 29, 30-year-old guy, I frequented all the time. Uhm, ah, it was, it was a marvelous place. This was also a time with anti war, ah, ah, things going on, ah, ah, ah, drugs and alcohol were, were, were rampant not only in, in ah, what was going on in college campuses, but in, in many respects in my own personal life as well. Ah, uhm, ah, and I'm not proud of it, but those were, that was, that was the just the times. There was also a, an important movement and, and civil, civil rights going on and the Chicano movement was also going on. It was a very, very interesting time to be at a university, at, at a university, in a university environment. But as my, as my self-study and reorientation ah, began, I also received a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health. I think Pat, I don't know if Pat was, I think, yeah, Pat Okura was definitely there at that time and this was a, a grant that I received to try to systematize the literature on Latinos ah, and in psychology and that work culminated in the little book that we called Latino Mental Health that was in fact published by ah, the ah, the ah, U.S. superintendent of documents or the government or someone. And I wrote that book with ah, Art Ruiz, and that really was the beginning of our collaboration. And as I said, that was a productive collaboration. One of the things I realized in, in that work was that there wasn't a great value from my colleagues in psychology for the work that I had been starting, that I started to do. Ah, I had been hired I guess to, to teach and was teaching Introduction to Psychology, Learning and Motivation, ah, and a course in developmental psychology at that time. And then I'd go up and I'd have the schizophrenic kind of experience and I'd go up and teach, at ah, chi(ph), the Psychology of Chicano ah, Children or Introduction of Chicano ah, students. But along the way, I also found out and I had a, a, a telephone call from the dean here at the UC Santa Barbara asking if I'd come in and visit him, and I, I went in to visit him. Actually, this was about six months after I got to the campus here and the dean informed me that I was the most senior Latino faculty member on the UC campus, and I was only about 29 years old and therefore because of that I was going to be appointed the chairman of the Chicano Studies Department. To me, I didn't, I, I didn't even know what I was doing particularly much less a chair of a department. The point is that's the esteem to which that department was held. Okay? Well, I would be the most senior person and also the chair. And that, that has been, I think, the culmination of, I mean, you know, lots and lots of experiences like that. 

00:55:30
AMADO PADILLA, PH.D. I decided to leave this(ph) ah, Santa Barbara in 1974 and go to UCLA. My sense was for that, my, my reason for that move was I didn't feel that I connected intellectually with anyone at UC Santa Barbara, and my point again about that is that's, that's the racism that my experience has been. It's been about intellectual racism. It's wrong to go all the way through this kind of an academic experience and not have faculty members who you, who can be role models or mentors and we're still experiencing that in many, many locations. Many of our young people still have experiences where they are isolated, they are alone, their interests as minority people, their ah, interests in learning about themselves and their communities are undervalued and unappreciated, and they are discouraged from that. Well, at UCLA ah, again ah, things went fairly well. Things went well for me ah, professionally there. I was tenured probably before many of you were even born, uhm, ah, and became a full professor ah, relatively quickly. At, at, at ah, UCLA, I also directed with Pat and other people's assistance. The NIMH funded a center for, I guess it was called the Spanish-speaking Mental Health Research Center. A lot of people in this room don't know this because they don't work in the, these areas. I also directed National Center for Bilingual Research at one time. I also directed the Center for Language Education and Research also at UCLA. 

00:57:05
AMADO PADILLA, PH.D. Over the course of about, ah, I guess, it was between 1971 and 1990, ah, I probably pro(ph), I, I guess if I did some counting, I published, you know, Latino Mental Health. We, I published the book way before the time called, "Crossing Cultures and Therapy". It sold about 2, about 2,000 copies. I guess it was published in 1980. It was about 10 years before ah, its time, I think. Ah, Nowadays, if I publish, a book like that it'd probably sell a few more thousand copies. I didn't make any money from that book, but it taught me some very important things about how to systematize a body of knowledge that was beginning to accumulate. We also published three annotated bibliographies on Latino Mental Health, and then a variety of articles and chapters. So it was a very productive period of time. It was also a period of time that I founded the "Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences" and I know that a number of you have published in that journal. Probably more have gotten rejections from the journal than I've published it and for that I, I'm sorry. (laughs) Ah, but, you know, I, I finally left UCLA in 1988 and I have deep regrets about leaving UCLA for after having been there for a very long while, and Stan, Sue and several other people were there by that time. But my, my regrets in leaving UCLA were the fact that I was leaving good friends in, at UCLA and people in Los Angeles but more importantly, one of my deepest regrets is that even though I had been there ah, for 14 years by that time, my sense was that I had not established intellectual bonds with anyone, with other colleagues, and that, that's, that's a very, very hard thing that I think to come away from, ah, in terms of an experience that you're working and you're working pretty much in isolation. I was working with some, some very, very good people I had. I did have good working relationships with people like Esteban(ph) Olmedo(ph); some of you may recognize Manny Casas who I know was here today, ah, a sociologist by the name of Rodolfo Alvarez, Nelly Salgado de Snyder, uhm, and then a, a very large number of, of graduate students, many of them in academic position, positions today, but still the feeling of academic isolation. 

00:59:25
AMADO PADILLA, PH.D.  I've been in, at, at Stanford now in the School of Education for, I guess this is my 13th year. To a very large extent and I still have that feeling of, of intellectual and academic isolation because of, of the work that even, you know, it always seems that if you're working in mainstream areas or if you believe you're working at mainstream areas, there's value, value added ah, ah, to, to that work as opposed to working in areas of multiculturalism despite all the rhetoric about the need for multiculturalism and diversity. And it's that has always been ah, ah, a problem in terms of at least my feeling about ah, about ah, racism. We've gotten much ah, more comfortable in talking about the need for diversity and the need for multiculturalism, but then in terms of our academic work and our institution and, and the people in which ah, ah, that lead, that lead those institutions, the work, I think is still, to a very large extent, undervalued. 

01:00:30
AMADO PADILLA, PH.D. Ah, let me summarize some take home messages. One is the issue of mentorship and role modeling. I went through much, I went, I've only had ever one role, one role model and one mentor and that was my friend Rene Ruiz. Ah, he offered intellectual support, social support. He taught me a lot of things about ah, about life ah, and not just about psychology. All of us need role models and mentors in our lives regardless of how old we are. Isn't that right, Pat? 

01:01:05
PATRICK OKURA, M.A. Right. 

01:01:05
AMADO PADILLA, PH.D. It's, it's important to have people that you can look to as, as a mentor and as a role model. Now, as, looking at you, some of you are in the situation of looking for your own role models and your own mentors, but you're also been asked to be role models and mentors to others and don't lose that opportunity because people need that. Ah, it's important that we take that responsibility and that we nurture our, our mentor and role relationships regardless of which side we're on, the recipient or the, the giver. 

01:01:40
AMADO PADILLA, PH.D. The other issue that I wanna, as a take home message is the issue of multi, that, from multiculturalism and work in multiculturalism is gonna be continually challenged with respect to ah, whether it is important. My sense is that we now recognize the value of culture and, and, and race in all that we do in the behavioral sciences and in the helping professions. It's important to consider culture and race in all that we do, research, and in the delivery of services. And in fact those people who are not working in the areas of culture and race or multiculturalism to my way of thinking are working outside of the box. And they are the ones that need to understand that their work is lacking an important ingredient in today's society in this country and in the future. Multiculturalism, the diversity of our population by all demographic intensity, looking just in California, you know, almost everywhere we turn, diversity and multiculturalism exists and it has to be incorporated into, into the mainstream work that we do and if it's not, you're working outside of the box. Thank you.

01:03:05
DERALD WING SUE, PH.D.  You know, I remember uhm, Amado, I remember Art Ruiz singing the song "Have Faith, Hope, and Ethnicity. That's the way to live successfully". (laugh) I don't do it very good. How many of you, uhm, saw the handsome photograph of ah, Joe White in the APA monitor? 

01:03:45
[sil.] 

01:03:45
DERALD WING SUE, PH.D.  You know, I always found it ironic, ah, ah, Joe, that someone referred to as the father of black psychology had a last name like White. Ah, but you, you always, I remember you and Charles Thomas one time trapping me ah, in the lobby and ah, trying to convince me that ah, I might be one, what is it, you say I might be yellow outside but truly black inside, and uhm, I, I felt that that was a compliment. I didn't understand the depth of the meaning because I just, I just didn't wanna be called a banana which ah, of course, my ah, my what is it, Division 39 brothers and sisters psychoanalysts who are generously sponsoring this ah, ah, program as well ah, might interpret a banana symbolically in a different way, ah, but that's not the topic of, of today's presentation. 

01:04:45
DERALD WING SUE, PH.D.  For the past 38 years, Dr. Joseph L. White has enjoyed a distinguished career in the field of psychology and mental health as a teacher, mentor, administrator, clinical supervisor, writer, consultant, and practicing psychologist. He was a pioneer in the field of black psychology and is affectionately referred to as one of the fathers of black psychology by those who have been fortunate enough to know him and to be touched by his professional work. His seminal article in Ebony Magazine in 1970 told that black psychology was instrumental and beginning the modern era of African-American and ethnic minority psychology. His productivity continues as he is author or co-author of the "Psychology of Blacks and African-American Perspective, the Troubled Adolescent and Black Man Emerging". Currently, professor, excuse me, I'm fighting a Maui bug right now. It says, "Currently, Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Psychiatry at the University of California Irvine", he continues to consult with school districts, universities, private organizations, drug prevention programs, and government agencies. Last August, at the American Psychological Association, Division 45 awarded Dr. White its highest distinction, the lifetime achievement award. Joe, will you do us the honor? 

01:06:20
Joe White, Ph.D. 

01:06:20
JOE WHITE, PH.D.  Now, you guys know what an Asian soul brother is. That's him. And usually, I'm the oldest dude on the set, but ah, now there's a dude almost a hundred, so he's older than me. 

01:06:45
JOE WHITE, PH.D.  So, why don't everybody stand up and stretch for 60 seconds. You've all been sitting too long. Say hello to somebody, you know. 60 seconds, you got about 35 left. Now about, 25. Okay. You can start to sit down now. And now we're gonna get you some lunch. I'm last, but not least, you know. Our time has run out. We're gonna get you some lunch. I'm not gonna keep you too long. Ah, I was out in Minneapolis and we had ah, prepared for a hundred black boys from 11 to 17, and 250 showed up, so we had to run down the street to Colonel Sanders and keep running back with buckets of chicken. And boy, those boys could eat, but we're gonna get you all some lunch, right? 

01:07:45
JOE WHITE, PH.D. Now, when I left home yesterday on United Airlines Express to get here from Irvine, I thought I had 18 minutes. I saw him in the hallway. He said I had five then I begged and pleaded, and I put Lisa Porche-Burke on him, and so now I think I've got eight and a half and am still running over. So, last night as I was trying to go to sleep, I couldn't think of what part of my speech I want to cut out, you know, and so I'd get up and I cut and paste and I go to bed for another hour and then I'd get up and cut and paste. Finally, I said to hell with it, I'll just go with the flow. 

01:08:20
[sil.] 

01:08:20
JOE WHITE, PH.D.  So, if anybody thinks they're big and bad enough to take this podium from me, you come on up here. 

01:08:30
JOE WHITE, PH.D.  And I got my home boys and home girls all through this audience and nobody's gonna mess with me today. And it must have been a good day ah, because that picture occurred in the psych monitor and now there's a young woman some here, where in here, that thinks James Jones looks just like me. So she was walking down the hallway this morning. She thought James Jones was me and she came up to him, wanted to give him a great big kiss, and she said, "Hi! Joe White" and he said, "I'm not Joe. I'm James". She said, "Well, I won't kiss you". But if she wants to kiss me, I'll be right out there in the hallway. Right you all? So as I sat here and listened to my colleagues, I think what's happened over the last 50 years is we brought the soul back into psychology. That's what's happened. William James ah, one of ah, James Jones' home boys ran the soul out of psychology back in the 19th century and the home boys here, they brought it on back. So that's what it's all about. 

01:09:45
[sil.] 

01:09:45
JOE WHITE, PH.D.  And I want to talk to you today about a 50-year journey in psychology that began when I was an 18-year-old sophomore at San Francisco State. And in many ways, it's a journey of invisibility to visibility. That's what that journey is all about. And it's not my journey, it's the journey of ethnic people in psychology. I just happened to be a part of it. And A. J. Franklin who's sitting also in the audience has a book coming out soon and I'm privy to a manuscript. I've been reading it for him and he talks about the invisibility syndrome. And as an 18-year-old sophomore at San Francisco State, I sat in the back of a class with three other black students. We could sit in where we want, but for some reason we sat in the back. And a young teacher who had just gotten his Ph.D. from UC Berkeley drew the mind according to Freud up on the board and he said there was the subconscious mind, the conscious mind, and the unconscious mind. And then he put the ego, the id, and the superego. Then here comes. He's talking about the libido and dreams. And I was just totally fascinated and captivated. And what's that word, the epiphany or something like that, I said, "Damn! You know, I wish I could've invented something like that. Damn!" Do you know what I mean? And I had never heard anything in school that ever fascinated me. You know what I mean? See, in my school, they just told you what to do and pass you on to the next grade, but I was totally captivated. And I also personalized it because I remembered some years earlier as I came into my early teen years and my hormones started to kick up on me and before I had a summer job, my mother would give me my chores every morning before she went to work, and then she would tell to go to Bible school after I finish my chores and then I could go play ball. But for some reason, I wanted to go sneak down the alley way and climb in the window of this girl's house, and she caught me doing that and she told me, "And don't go down in that girl's house when her mother is not home". But I persisted in going down there, climbing through the window. But sitting in that class that day at San Francisco State, I said, "That was my id, my libido, acting up". And then I got defense mechanisms, you know, to protect me when mother came home. See what I mean? So I said, "Damn! I am totally fascinated with this stuff and this is what I want to be. I want to be a young clinical psychologist just like this dude". He had good interpersonal skills. He was good-looking. He had a great flow of body and I said this is me. 

01:12:20
JOE WHITE, PH.D.  And I had one problem, that I almost didn't solve. I lived in the second largest state in the Union. That was California. The most liberal city in America. There was not nary a one, black Ph.D. psychologist in the state of California. Not nary a one. There were none at San Francisco State, UC Berkeley, the UC system, the junior college system. We got the largest college system in America, not a nary a one, invisibility. And what did that say to me as an 18 year old? What did that say to me about America? Invisibility. Go ask A.J. Franklin. In my soul, in the pit of my soul, I knew what I wanted, but I was afraid, afraid to say it, say it out loud. People asked me, "What do you wanna be, Joe?" "I don't know". You know, people say well, do you work at the recreation department. Well you could, you get your B.A., you could be supervisor down there and this and that. So I was afraid to say it because I thought people would say I was crazy. Boy, what are you talking about? You wanna be a college professor and a psychologist. Boy! You, ah, ah, man you've had too much of that bad wine or something down on Fillmore Street man with Willy Brown, you know. 

01:13:45
JOE WHITE  And so the first of my transitions was a fascination with psychology. The second transition was getting into graduate school. And when I graduated in 1954 with the bachelor's degree, 97 to 98 percent of the psychology departments in America had never had an African-American graduate student. We were colored and Negros then. Not nary a one, nary a one. Bob Guthrie has statistics. You don't believe me, you call Bob Guthrie or e-mail him. So now what was I gonna do? So I was gonna walk away from that. I was gonna say the hell with it because I don't have all my life to be messing with no white folks who ain't gonna behave. But my mother was a very strong, resourceful woman, and she told me, "Son, don't be walking away from this 'til you go out and test the water." Her theme was make something from nothing. Make a way when there ain't no way. Wade Nobles, a former student of mine calls that the corner stone of African-American psychology called improvisation. Make it happen. Put it together. 

01:15:00
JOE WHITE  So I commenced to writing some letters designed to get an answer and lo and behold, out of the blue, the president's office from Michigan State called me up on the telephone, and they said, "You know something, you may be the kind of Negro we are looking for." Hear ya'll! And they flew out to San Francisco to interview me, my young and beautiful wife and my baby who is now a professor at Stanford University with him, Laurie White. And said, "Well, son, you know something. We're gonna give a little assistance and we're gonna buy you some snow tires for your car. We're gonna get you some winter clothes for you and your baby and your wife because you are coming to East Lansing, Michigan." And shortly thereafter Vic Ramey called me from Colorado and said, "Well, son, you wanna come out here to Boulder". I said, "When I already told the white folks at Michigan I'm coming." So I got to go. Yeah. So I, the second part of the journey was I did get into graduate school, and I shouldn't say this because of what my colleague said, but I'm gonna tell you the truth, I loved graduate school. Harold Davis is here who was a colleague of mine in graduate school. I loved every bit of it. I loved academic psychology, whatever, and school, it was not that difficult for me not because I'm a genius, but school is predictable. School is sequential and predictable from the first grade forward, and they'll let play in preschool and kindergarten. First grade, they'll you call in there and say look here boy, come here. Two and two is four and I want you to remember that because tomorrow I might ask you how much it is. Then, you come in there and then you write two and two is four, and then so you go to the next grade. They ask you what is three minus one plus two and you'll say, "Oh damn! I didn't study that one." "Well, go and do homework, son," and it's just the same thing every year. You come to graduate school. They say, "We're gonna give you the T-test and now it's the variance, covariance, factor analysis, rotate the factor, squeeze a couple of more factors out there and go on to the next grade.

01:17:15
JOE WHITE And that's called in science the context of confirmation. You do what's already been confirmed, not a context of creativity is something else. So we go through graduate school and we get out in 1961. Now, I don't know where I had been in America, but there was a big Civil Rights Movement going on. Now when I left graduate school, I was in what Tom Parham would call the preencounter stage. I was a Black Anglo Saxon. I believed in Peugeot(ph), in Freud, in Pavola, Thorndike, Bennett, Carl Rogers, and Abraham Maslow. And I thought I would be the next one up. And several events between 1961 and 1968 when we went to San Francisco and formed the Black Psyche Association jarred of my consciousness and moved me into the stage of black consciousness. And when the jarred at big time was in 1965 before Rodney King was born, the brothers burned down (inaudible ). I was a young professor and Long Beach state. I live 18 miles from the riot zone, and if you wanna have a riot you do it in LA because you can jump on the freeway once the police close you off in one neighborhood and arrive four blocks down with a car load of molotov cocktails and you're on baby, burn baby, burn. 

01:18:50
JOE WHITE  So the brothers burned up the community. Here I am, trying to be Peugeot(ph) at, I'm really confused now, man. I got confusion, man. I, I don't know what's happening to me, man. So anyhow, the brothers burned the community down for four days and everyday on TV experts would get on TV from UCLA, SC, and wherever they could find them sociologists, social psychologist, and they would try to explain why the brothers were burning the community down. But they kept on burning. So the third day, they finally figured it out. Maybe, we're interviewing the wrong experts because they was all white folks. So they say, "We've got to find some Negros who have expertise in the behavioral sciences to explain why these brothers is burning their community down. So they looked all over Southern California. They called every college in California, "Do you all have any Negros in the behavioral sciences?" So I was at Long Beach State in the psychology department, teaching, Freud, Peugeot(ph), Jung, whatever and they called the president of the college and he says, "Yes, we have a little Negro fella down there and he is a psychologist and let me go find him. As a matter of fact, he's a consultant at a clinic in South Central LA and some of his patients are burning the community down." So he oughtta know what's going on. 

01:20:30
JOE WHITE  So I lived outside the riot zone so they brought the big trucks. They didn't have these microwaves back then with mini cams. They brought the big trucks out in front of my house and neighbors standin' all out in front of white folks carrying on, and they ask me, "Why are the Negros burning the community down in the promised land of California?" I said, "Because they're god damn angry." 

01:21:00
[sil.] 

01:21:00
JOE WHITE  And over night I shifted from being a Black Anglo Saxon to the immersion stage of blackdom. Man, I became the blackest dude around, man. And then a year later, a young man that I had been working with, a Mr. Stokely Carmichael was walking down the street. This is the book, "Stokely Speaks," was walking down the road in Greenwood, Mississippi, and they got some low down red neck crackers in Mississippi. I'm gonna tell you something, man, and I'll tell anybody that. You know, call me racist, call me whatever. They got some bad folks down in Mississippi. Man, Stokely jumped up and hollered, black power, black power, black power and that gave me an idea, you know, it's what Stokely was saying, "Well, you know something, if you're gonna define yourself, you really can't let somebody else define it for you. You can't let white folks define what black is all about. You gotta define it yourself." I said, "Dog, that is right," you know and then people running around and telling them black is beautiful. I'm so glad I'm black, black, black, black. And it was complete a hundred and eighty degree reversal because when we were children, we used to say, "If you're white, you're right. If you're yellow, you're mellow. If you're brown, stick around and if you're black, get back." Didn't we say Harv(ph) right. And serious Stokely turned it completely around. If you black, you are right, and suddenly black was in. I mean people use to call your girlfriend if you had a real black girlfriend, they'd call her midnight, say, "Joe, where is your midnight girlfriend?" But now midnight was the most beautiful girl around. You know, people got big lip and nappy hair. You know what I mean? So we commenced to hollering about this black psychology then we all went to APA we all. There was about nine of us. 

01:22:50
JOE WHITE  We all went to APA at 1968. And at APA, we had a come to Jesus meeting with the executive council of APA. And was held in the Mark Hopkins Hotel I believe in San Francisco and was in a room with a big oval table. And the executive council of APA was on one side of the table and us was on the other. Me, Bob Williams, Bob Green, Charles Thomas. I think A.J. was there and a couple of other folks, and it was a come to Jesus meeting. It started out diplomatically and then it broke down and I hate to use this language in front of young women maybe I'm a sexist. It broke down into you white mother fucker will kick your ass and it was terrible. Leona Tyler was crying and oh, it was something else. So when we finally made peace, what we said was now look here. Ya'll got to shape this psychology up. Now the first thing is we are invisible in psychology. We're not in graduate school. We're not professors. You write books, we're not in there and then every now and then in the book the word Negro appears and under that ya'll got a low I.Q. You all got can't delay gratification. You all can't plan for the future and I told them when I read that stuff you're talking about my mama and you not gonna talk about my mama, I don't care what kind of psychology book you've written. You wanna go to war with me. You called my mama dumb and lazy. You know, you might talk about me. So that we broke down again. So then we left the meeting and though we had a press conference and we talked about the deficit deficiency model and this and that and the other. We can't use in this term black psychology. So finally the reporter asked us he said, "Well, what is this black psychology you all keep talking about?" And we were from the oral tradition and we had never written it down. We knew what it was. We could feel what it was, but we couldn't break it down. You know what I mean? So then we told the press, "Well, ya'll come back tomorrow and we'll tell you what it is." 

01:25:05
JOE WHITE So I'm gonna tell you some, I'm gonna tell it on my brothers too. We were supposed to right this position paper, don't you never not, do not ever, don't you never, double negative, don't you never try to write no position paper on black psychology on Saturday night in San Francisco over Labor Day. Don't you never, ah, ah. I had a hotel suit and after we made peace with APA, they gave us a charge card so we could charge whatever we want except alcohol, food you want, and stuff like that. Man, I had food up in that hotel suite and everything. Brothers supposed to come and help me write the paper and nobody showed up, not nary a one. " Oh I got to go to see my girlfriend, I got to go here. I, we, I'll be back after a while Joe," and I sat up there with all that food and coffee. So I scribbled something down, and what I scribbled down, later became this paper torn of Black Psychology, that was in Ebony Magazine. And when, I don't know how to operate this overhead, so I just hold it up. It said Ebony Magazine. 

01:26:15
[sil.] 

01:26:15
JOE WHITE And the reason when we created this new paradigm in black psychology, the reason we put it in Ebony Magazine was deliberate. We wanted the people to own the psychology, not the academicians, 'coz back in the 1970, they didn't have papariah psychology. It was an academic discipline. But we wanted to move beyond the academy and have people like Horace Mitchell, who was just starting graduate school and Nancy Boyd-Franklin, who was getting ready to start, we wanted them to have a basis from which to operate. We wanted high school students to understand the psychology. We wanted people in barbershops and beauty shops and so forth and so on. Now, these gentlemen have touched base with academia, so I remember that same year, I came up for a merit increase. And of course, I'm at the University of California, which believes it is the Flagship University of America. So I went in for my merit increase and they pay you, I think, $2000, and that's what black people called chump change. There are people in this room who make three or four thousand dollars a speech, so $2000 is nothing. But anyway, I had to go for this review and they had my little dosier set in there, and they pulled out this paper here, and they said, "This is Ebony Magazine? This is not a rough for read journal. And you don't have any numbers in here. What is wrong with you? When are you going to start with the real psychology?" And you can tell from the way that I'm standing here that nobody is going to talk to me that way. I said, "Look here, I'm gonna tell you something. You haven't invented a goddamn thing in your life. All you were doing is a bunch of those numbers and statistics, that same old stuff we learned in the graduate school, and so don't you talk to me in this way, cause I'm gonna go home and get my gun and come back here, and I'm gonna bust the cap in your ass." And one of my friends sitting down in the front, when I told her about busting a cap, she thought about anal explosiveness siesta(ph). And uh as Horace Mitchell knows, I was brought up on charges that time, of a, threatening my faculty with a gun, and this and that, you know, and they had the hearing officer, and I told them, " I was speaking in ebonics(ph) man. Don't you ever heard of ebonic(ph)?" I said, "When we were children, we had cap guns. You know what I mean, I was gonna just, you know, get a cap gun, you know what I mean. And furthermore, I wanna countercharge them with racism, racial harassment. Speaking to me in a condescending manner." So since there were charges and countercharges, they forgot about the whole thing. 

01:29:00
JOE WHITE  So finally, now we've got the psychology and we got the black and we got the cross cultural psychology. And now, we are now moving toward rapproachement, reconciliation. We're gonna bring this two psychologies together. We got in this either/or thing with this Aristotelian logic. You know, either you have universal law or you just gonna have endless, you know, proliferations or pluralism, and this and that. So now, we gonna move past the contradiction and we're gonna have culturally different psychology and we're going to have universal law. And we're gonna move from a kind of coexistence to coming back together, slowly but surely, and this generation would do it. The old people can't get past the Aristotelian logic. But the young people understand this, cause we're going through the browning of America. By 2050, America will be half minority. It's already so right here in California, where you live with all kind of different folks. So we're going through a rapproachement, and it's already started at a smaller level, and then I'll close. As I was going through this transition from negro to black, I had a falling out with the people that trained me at Michigan State. Do you know what they accused me of doing? They said I brought racism into psychology. And I told them that racism was already in psychology. I didn't bring it up in there. They said, "Well, why did you have to say something about this? Why do you have to talk this black and all? We didn't train you for that?" Well I said, "Well, you can't take my Ph.D. back from me. I'm gonna do what I want now. I did what you all said." So, anyway, I couldn't even get my graduate students in there for many years. I'd have to send them somewhere else because of this falling out. But now, we've had a thaw. And we have decided to make peace. And they had the 50th anniversary of the Psychology department, the clinical program at Michigan State. They had the 50th Anniversary in 1996. It was started right after World War II with a grant from the VA and the United States Public Health Service. And they called us all back there, and they gave out one award in clinical psychology, and they gave it to me. 50 years later.

01:31:20
JOE WHITE And what was even more amazing to me, two of my major professors are still living there, in their mid 80s. They got up there, introducing me, and they said that they had planted the idea of African-American psychology in my head in 1959, thank you Jesus.
