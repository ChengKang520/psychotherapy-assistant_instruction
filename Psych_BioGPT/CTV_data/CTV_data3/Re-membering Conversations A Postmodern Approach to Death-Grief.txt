A Remembering Conversation with Lorraine Hedtke Ph.D. and John Winslade Ph.D. 

00:00:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so Lorraine, you're gonna be conducting a remembering conversation with Tranda in a few minutes. 

00:00:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:00:40
JOHN WINSLADE And I would like to just ask you a little bit about what you're doing, so that people can appreciate, um, what your intentions are. So, can you say something about how remembering conversations differ from the conventional approach to grief counseling? 

00:00:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Sure. Um, I think that would be helpful so people can listen for some of those points of difference as I'm talking with Tranda. 

00:01:00
JOHN WINSLADE (crosstalk) Yes. 

00:01:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Um, so let me just briefly, very briefly speak to what I'm not doing first, okay. 

00:01:10
JOHN WINSLADE Not doing, that is part of what often does happen. 

00:01:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. And, um, in the conversation that I wanna have, to have a remembering, um, context, that I'm not gonna be talking about the places where the relationship has been disconnected. Just because the person that we're speaking about has died, um, that, for, in my mind the relationship is very much alive and active and accessible. So I'm not going to be asking stories about, um, how she was able to say goodbye, I'm not gonna be asking about stories, for example, of completion, or letting go, um, uh, as, um, uh, looking to access points for her to have healed from, or how she got over her grief, for example. So that's a little bit about how the conventional grief psychology... 

00:02:00
JOHN WINSLADE (crosstalk) What about the experience of loss? 

00:02:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, I'm not gonna privilege that story out. Um, thank you for asking me about that. Uh, the, the story of loss is often a part of the stories of, of death and grief. 

00:02:10
JOHN WINSLADE Mh-mm. 

00:02:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Um, but they're not the only stories of death and grief, and I wanna access kind of that multiplicity of story. 

00:02:20
JOHN WINSLADE And what about acceptance, are you looking for the, to invite her to move towards acceptance of loss? 

00:02:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Um, no, again I, I don't wanna privilege out, um, the, either the stories of loss, or to believe, um, or create the belief that there will someday be an end point to that. And acceptance assumes those kinds of, um, um, emotional states as something we can get over. So in the conventional, ah, grief psychology that those things would be highlighted as important, that people would be moving through a certain series, or certain set of tasks that they need to complete in order to achieve some kind of exalted position of acceptance that, that the loved one is dead. I work from a very different, um, perspective. Just to mention a couple things, so that people again can be listening for this and looking for this in, in the conversation. Um, as I mentioned a minute ago, um, I believe that the relationship is still viable, still accessible. Just because the person has physically died, the relationship has not stopped, um, in the life of the living person. 

00:03:25
JOHN WINSLADE It's gotta be different, though, then? 

00:03:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE It is different. Um, obviously it's different. Um, she cannot pick up the phone and call the person who has died. 

00:03:30
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hmm. 

00:03:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Um, she can't, um, go for a holiday meal with that person, um, in their physicality. 

00:03:40
JOHN WINSLADE (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:03:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE So the relationship has changed, and I wanna speak to, and find out in what ways has the relationship, relationship changed. But I want to assume that the relationship continues to feed her, and continue to have a place of belonging in her life, and actually gives her a way, um, to make sense out of life. As, as, so we don't want to discard those gifts that the relationship had. So remembering offers that platform, um, where we can, um, get to know the person, and the context in, and, um, how that relationship was, and in what ways do we want to edit that person back into, um, edit, excuse me, the dead person back into the living person's life, in a way that's useful, provides resource, sometimes helps them with those stories of loss that can be tremendously painful. Umm... 

00:04:30
JOHN WINSLADE Are you speaking about the concept of saying hello again? 

00:04:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:04:35
JOHN WINSLADE (crosstalk) As you say there? 

00:04:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, that, exactly. 

00:04:35
JOHN WINSLADE (crosstalk) Rather than saying goodbye? 

00:04:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. And so if we wanna reference Michael White's article, "Saying Hello Again," it's about looking at what's the other side of the story. Rather than saying goodbye we wanna create those stories that are about where do I refresh the relationship with a person who has died, and in what ways will that relationship continue to be shaped, continue to change, um, continue to become alive, um, even in the face of death. 

00:05:00
JOHN WINSLADE So, remembering is often spelled with a hyphen between re and membering, why is that? 

00:05:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Um, Barbara Meyerhoff was an anthropologist, um, uh, in the 70s and 80s who, um, created that term, um, and put the hyphen between the, the r-e and then the, the membering or membership. Um, her belief was that we live in, um, are born into a sense of a membership club, um, that we're born with certain people who hold primary importance, and, and those people help to shape our identities and shape who we become. Throughout life that the, those people, um, that club continues to unfold, we add people, um, to that club, sometimes people take on less of an importance, um, you know a spouse might take on more of an importance in our later years than our parents did when we were young, for example. Um, when a person dies, the, um, membership status is not necessarily canceled out or erased. And so what she talked about was the active process of reinvesting in or reinvigorating a relationship, um, into a person's membership club after they died. 

00:06:15
JOHN WINSLADE For what reason, then? 

00:06:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Um, for the reason, for the person who's living? 

00:06:20
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hmm. 

00:06:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Um, it would be, uh, about creating a sense of agency, creating a sense of strength, finding places of, of resource to, um, both become the, um, ah, kind of ventriloquist for the person who has died, who continues to have those stories matter and provide substance, um, and continue to shape the living person's identity. Um, so she would, would talk about how it becomes a statement of emotional strength, ah, and resource. I'm not sure if I'm answering your question or not there. 

00:06:55
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah that's fine. Yeah. 

00:06:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Okay. Okay. 

00:06:55
JOHN WINSLADE So, what can people gain out of, um, feeling a closer connection with other people who are in their membership club, even though that person has died? 

00:07:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE I think it's a nice thing, you know. Um, the people who, and, I'm just thinking about my own life, the people who have died, um, I don't wanna discard the, the times that we shared, the lessons that they taught me, um, the stories that they told. Uh, and it's, ah, a pleasant recollection, um, or reinvestment in the relationship. It makes my life feel more rich, more full, um, that I get to have them with me. Um, the idea of kind of disconnecting from that seems too painful, in many ways. Um, uh, instead I wanna kind of look at how do we bring those, those pieces of the past that are the best, um, forward, nurture them, grow them, um, and keep them with us for the rest of our lives. 

00:07:55
JOHN WINSLADE Which sounds kind of different from the usual, individualistic focus of sort of Western cultural thinking about, um, how you live your life. (inaudible ) 

00:08:08
LORRAINE HEDTKE (crosstalk) Absolutely. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, the remembering practices and the remembering conversations allow us to step into a relational, um, ah, space with grief psychology. And that's dramatically different from thinking about, you know, what was your experience as a bereaved person, as to, as opposed to what is your experience along side of and in journeying with the person who has died. 

00:08:30
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm. Now as you talk with Tranda, what should we be listening for, that you are trying to do? 

00:08:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE I would be, um, wanting people to listen for the places where the relationship continues to hold vitality, um, for Tranda. So where does the relationship with the deceased loved one continue to encourage her, inspire her, um, ah, be vitally accessible to her, and to continue to guide her. 

00:09:00
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm, okay. Well thank you for that. 

00:09:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE You're welcome. 

00:09:05
JOHN WINSLADE I will ask you a little bit more after you've finished the conversation with Tranda, and we'll talk then about, you know, what has happened. 

00:09:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Sure, that's great, thank you. 

00:09:15
[sil.] 

00:09:15
The following is a conversation about Remembering..... 

00:09:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE So, Tranda, I am really happy that you have come in to talk with me today about somebody who is no longer living. Um, what I want to do with you in the next little bit is have a remembering conversation, is what we call them, about somebody who has passed. Um, before we do that, though, I just want to talk a little bit about the context in which we're doing it, 'cause it's a little bit unusual. Normally when I would have a remembering conversation, it would be a lot more private, um, with somebody, because of, um, the camera being here and people watching, it's a little more public. Um, so I just wanna kind of touch base with you about that, um, I'm wondering where you're at with that, um,if you have any questions about what we're doing, um, or any concerns that you might have. 

00:10:10
TRANDA Um, no questions or concerns at this time. 

00:10:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Alright, alright. Um, when you volunteered for this project, um, you volunteered specifically for remembering conversation, is that right? 

00:10:25
TRANDA Yes. 

00:10:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Okay. So, I'm taking that to mean that there was someone, um, close to you that you wanted to talk about? 

00:10:30
TRANDA Yes. 

00:10:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Okay. Um, can I ask you to introduce me to that person as a, a place of starting? 

00:10:35
Introducing the loved one starts a remembering conversation and places a relationship in context 

00:10:35
TRANDA Okay. Um, my mother passed away, um, in 2005, and we had a, a very unique relationship. 

00:10:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Did you? 

00:10:45
TRANDA Um, I'm from a family of 12. Um, my mother, um, worked, um, a lot, so she was not around a lot, but I always felt that I had her support in anything that I wanted to do. 

00:11:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:11:00
TRANDA Um, one of the things that she stressed was education, and always trying to be the best person that you could be. 

00:11:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right, right. 

00:11:10
TRANDA Um, I went off to college, I, I still felt like I had her support, um, even though we weren't, you know, calling each other on a regular basis, but I knew if I had issues, I could always depend on her, and, um. 

00:11:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. Right. 

00:11:25
TRANDA When I lost my mom, I, you know, she was 76 years old, so, you know, I knew that that time would come. 

00:11:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mhmm. 

00:11:35
TRANDA Um, but, um. Losing her has created a void for me, and, so. 

00:11:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:11:40
TRANDA It's so funny because I tell people all the time how fortunate you are to have your family close. 

00:11:45
Double listening hears two stories: the story of the void and the story of her mother's voice 

00:11:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mhmm. 

00:11:50
TRANDA I don't have my family close even though I'm from a big family. Um, but when I need my mom, and I know some people may think this is a little bit weird, but I hear her voice. 

00:12:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

00:12:00
TRANDA And if I sit quietly enough, I can hear her call my name. Um, sometimes when I'm sleeping, um, her voice actually wakes me up. And I'm looking around, thinking, you know. But I know it's because she's always gonna be with me, um, and when I hear her call my name, anything that I'm dealing with, it, it kinda, it doesn't just, it doesn't go away, but it allows me to actually deal with it the way that I should. 

00:12:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:12:35
TRANDA So. I hear my mom's voice, whenever I need her. 

00:12:35
Choosing to focus on the relationship rather than on the void 

00:12:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE So, I'm gonna come back to that in a minute, to that really precious, um, image of her calling your voice, um, and I wonder if I can kind of, um, um, bring some flesh to, to her a little bit, and, um, get to know her also, um, as part of this. 'Cause I'm curious about what kind of woman was she when she was alive. 

00:13:00
TRANDA Right. 

00:13:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE You said she worked a lot, she had 12 children. 

00:13:05
TRANDA Mhmm. 

00:13:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Um, so tell me more things about her. 

00:13:05
TRANDA Let's see. Um, I don't even know if my mom graduated from high school. Um, my mother was a maid, so at five o'clock in the morning she would get up, she would cook us breakfast, and then we wouldn't probably see her until six o'clock in the evening. But one of the things that she always instilled in us is hard work, and being part of a team. Um, and she would always say as she was leaving, the same thing every, every morning, "There's meat on the counter, and when I come home, I expect it to be on the stove." And she didn't say, "Girls, I want you to cook, she didn't say boys, I want you to cook," she says, she just kind of instilled a sense of, um, respect when you, when you were little, and you just carried that on as you got older. So, my mom was, um, a very hard worker. Um, my mother was a seamstress, she could sew really well, and, um, most of our, most of our clothing came from thrift stores. 

00:14:10
Listening for stories of how she instilled respect 

00:14:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:14:10
TRANDA But she would go and find really nice pieces, and if they needed to be mended she would mend them. 

00:14:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right, right, right. 

00:14:20
TRANDA And so, today, that's why I love going into thrift stores. 

00:14:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right, right. 

00:14:25
TRANDA Because as a little girl, we would always go on Saturday, that's when we shopped. Um, but, she was always a hard worker. 

00:14:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. A resourceful woman. 

00:14:30
TRANDA Mhmm. 

00:14:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Is that right? 

00:14:35
TRANDA Mhmm, yeah. 

00:14:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

00:14:35
TRANDA I, I think, um. And she was a giver. Um, I can remember a time when we were younger, um, my mother, um, there was a man who entered our kitchen, you know, and he smelled food cooking, you know, 'cause on Fridays, um, we always had fish on Fridays, that was, fish on Fridays, so whether you liked fish or not, fish on Fridays. 

00:15:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right, right. 

00:15:00
TRANDA And, so, um, I think he smelled the fish cooking, and he was, um, he, you know, he looked like a homeless person, and, um, my mother found him in the kitchen, and you would have thought that she would be kind of 'whoa,' you know. But she didn't, she just kinda asked him if he was hungry, and he said yes, and she gave him a plate of food, he ate it, and he left. But she was always a giver. And, so, um, I remember that much about her. And, and, I think the reason why we survived, was, why she survived, and was able to care for 12 kids, is because she was a giver. And we, we lived in a neighborhood, ah, where people would actually give us things, like, um, food, fresh fruit, or whatever, you know. And so, I don't think we have those kind of communities anymore. You know, when I was growing up, if someone needed something, your neighbor helped you out, you know, and, um, your neighbors helped discipline the children, ah, you know. So, I think things have changed a little bit. 

00:16:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Did you have a sense, I don't know if this is, um, so or not, um, but that your neighbors in part gave in response to her giving? 

00:16:20
Inquiry into the relational significance of her values 

00:16:20
TRANDA I think so 

00:16:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yes? 

00:16:20
TRANDA I think so. 

00:16:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Okay. 

00:16:25
TRANDA Um, because, like I said, she was always a giver. And we didn't have a whole heck of a lot, but if someone needed something, she would give it. Um, so, I think my mom, um. I'll tell you, I'll tell you a story about my family. We went, we lived in Florida and I went to undergraduate school in North Carolina, and, um, to send one of her kids off to college was a big thing, 'cause she didn't have a whole heck of a lot of money. But when I graduated, my family rented an RV, including my brothers and sisters and my mom, and they actually drove all the way down to the ceremony. And that was a big, big deal, big expense. Um, when I had an opportunity to visit, um, homes, like, you know, um, my classmates would invite me for Christmas, or they invite me for Thanksgiving and I, I would go to one year I went to New York with my roommate, um, and then I went, um, another roommate, I went to Virginia to visit her family and that was a great opportunity, and every time I had those kinds of opportunities, my family would put together a little bit of money, you know, whether it's five dollars from everybody or maybe three dollars from everybody, and actually send it to me, just as some support. You know they, they, my, my siblings and my mom were, they were never, um, jealous people, so if they saw an opportunity for me, they would wanna support that. 

00:17:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right, right. 

00:17:55
TRANDA And, um. So, my mom taught us really well. 

00:18:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

00:18:00
TRANDA Yeah, and so. 

00:18:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE So, tell me then, um, there's so much richness there in what you're saying, um, thinking about which pieces I wanna help, um, ah, bring out for our conversation today. And I'm wondering, Tranda, about what kinds of things, stories, lessons, have stayed with you as meaningful, um, in your adult life. 

00:18:25
Asking not just about stories but also about their ongoing meaning 

00:18:25
TRANDA Well, one of the things I think is important is that no matter what happens in your life, no matter what types of relationships you have, I always told people that you, you should not allow people to change who you are. I'm a giver. So, if I feel like I wanna give to a person, I may not necessarily agree with what they're doing at the moment, but if I wanna give, I'm a giver. I don't, I don't need anyone to approve of my giving, ah, and I always tell folks, never let someone change who you are. And that's one of the things that I think that I've learned from my mom. Most people looking at her as being, um, a single parent, trying to raise 12 kids, mostly by herself, they would sort of look down on her. But she never really let that bother her. And it never changed who she was. I think I, I've kind of allowed that to happen in my life, and I have to keep remembering that when I have disagreements, um. 

00:19:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:19:30
TRANDA Everybody doesn't function like me, and, and, however though, I won't, I won't let anybody change who I am and how I function. So I try to stay true to that. 

00:19:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right, right. 

00:19:45
TRANDA And so that's helped me, I think. 

00:19:45
Inviting her mother's voice into the conversation as an appreciative audience 

00:19:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE What would she say about that, what would she appreciate about how her daughter has stayed true to that ethic in life. 

00:19:55
TRANDA I, I think she would approve of it. Um, when I was small, I was a little bit of a, a weird kinda kid. I won't say weird, but different, maybe I should say that, um. My siblings, um, when I was growing up, they were very outgoing, ah, they went to the local recreation center. 

00:20:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:20:20
TRANDA Me, I found that very uncomfortable for me, because I, I would have to walk into a building with a, building, and there's a lot of people there. And as, as you go in the door, people's eyes are on you. 

00:20:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

00:20:30
TRANDA And I, I really didn't like that feeling. Most of my young, my young, my younger years, I spent reading. I loved to read. 

00:20:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mhmm. 

00:20:40
TRANDA From the time that I was, I could read, I was reading. 

00:20:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

00:20:40
TRANDA Um, and I would hear my mother call me, like she would be looking for me, and I would hear her call me, and then she would find me, I would be in my room, with my feet on the wall, and I would be reading. Um, and I, so that, in a sense I was a little bit different than my siblings, not that they didn't like to read, but I, I just, I kind of got lost in books. 

00:21:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

00:21:05
TRANDA And so, um, I, I think I, my mother knew I was a little bit different, and I, and I think she appreciated that difference, I think that's why she pushed me so hard to, um, you know, go to school, and, you know, um, be successful, um, because she knew that. 

00:21:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE What did she know about you? That, that, so that she created that push for you? What did she see in Tranda? 

00:21:35
Identity question through the eyes of the deceased 

00:21:35
TRANDA I think I was, ah, somewhat strong-willed, um, my mother had curfews and, you know, most of the time I'd break them, being honest with you. 

00:21:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, okay. 

00:21:45
TRANDA Well, she would never, she would always have her rules, and, and I could, I could tell you one, one incident that happened when I was in high school, I remember this, and I tell people this all the time. She had, she had, my curfew was probably 11:30, and I was notorious for, for going past 11:30. 

00:22:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:22:05
TRANDA And, ah, one, one night I got home probably at 12, you know, again, you know, past 11:30. And the, the last time I left with my friend, she says, "Just remember, if you're not back in the house at 11:30, everything you own will be outside." 

00:22:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mhmm. 

00:22:25
TRANDA I said, "Oh, she won't do that." So that night, my friend and I, you know, she's dropping me off, and we always lived, our house was on the corner, corner house, so when you turned the, when you turned that curve, boom. 

00:22:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:22:40
TRANDA Place right there. And that night, I turned the corner, and I said, "What is that laying all over the yard?" And I was very, I was very, um, I loved clothes, I mean, in high school I was putting my clothes in the cleaners', I mean, and so she knew, and so, um. 

00:23:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE She knew how to get to you. 

00:23:00
TRANDA Oh, yeah. So everything I owned, including the things that I had probably just taken out of the cleaners' was just... 

00:23:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Just, on the yard? 

00:23:10
TRANDA On the yard. And I said, "That woman has actually lost her mind." And so she always followed through, so I got that from her, you know, always follow through. So, um. 

00:23:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE This lesson stuck with you. 

00:23:20
TRANDA Yeah, and she knew I was always headstrong anyway, so. I think, um, she was so proud, though, you know, seeing me go off to school, and, and things like that, and, um. And so I think that's one of the things that my mom has taught us, to just work with what you have, um, and appreciate what you have. 

00:23:45
Remembering here underpins ongoing relationship 

00:23:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Sure, sure. 

00:23:45
TRANDA So I, I really, um, I really, when I, when I'm in need, that voice of hers calms me. And I think that's very important. 

00:23:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Can I talk a little bit about that with you? 

00:23:55
TRANDA Mhmm. 

00:23:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Because I'm curious about that. I was thinking about, you were telling me how when you were little and you would get lost in a book, that you would hear her voice calling you. 

00:24:05
TRANDA Mhmm. 

00:24:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE And you told me, um, a few minutes before that, Tranda, about how, um, since her death there's times that you hear her calling you. 

00:24:15
Referencing the stories of the past as resource for the present 

00:24:15
TRANDA Mhmm. 

00:24:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE I'm wondering, um, if that calling has a similar texture, and tone, um, in her wanting to get your attention. 

00:24:30
TRANDA Um, it's the same. 

00:24:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mhmm. 

00:24:30
TRANDA It's, it's her calling my name, it's not higher or lower than most, it's just the same. 

00:24:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mhmm. And what does she want you to notice? 

00:24:40
Use of the present tense keeps her mother alive 

00:24:40
TRANDA She doesn't, I just hear her voice calling my name. 

00:24:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mhmm. 

00:24:45
TRANDA And then I, like sometimes I wake up, um, but I could have gone to bed with a lot of things on my mind, and, I just think it's a symbol to say, you know, I'm, I'm here. 

00:25:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mhmm. 

00:25:00
TRANDA To, I don't know, just to calm me, and, and, um. 

00:25:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

00:25:10
TRANDA 'Cause when I was growing up, I knew my mother supported me a whole heck of a lot, um, and then I think sometimes I need that. 

00:25:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Sure. 

00:25:15
TRANDA As I go through life, um. 

00:25:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Sure. 

00:25:20
TRANDA I don't think it's weird or anything. 

00:25:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:25:25
TRANDA I, I... 

00:25:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE I don't think it's weird either. I, I was thinking about, you know, what does, what does that do for you, um, now, you know, and one of the things you're saying is that it calms you. 

00:25:35
Folds the strength of the connection into the present 

00:25:35
TRANDA It calms me. 

00:25:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Okay. 

00:25:35
TRANDA And I tell her, and sometimes I say to myself, I say to myself, I don't say it out loud or anything, I say to her, you know, in my mind, that it's okay, mom, I know that you're there, and everything's gonna be okay. 

00:25:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mhmm. 

00:25:50
TRANDA And so I think I use it as that, as my, um, a tool that can calm me and let me know that, hey, whatever, whatever is on your mind is not a big deal. You know, you can work through it, and, um, I think that just hearing her voice helps me. 

00:26:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. How is it then, that, um. You're saying that sometimes that when you are, you've kinda put that in a context that, um, that you're concerned that other people might think it's weird, is, am I understanding that, or? 

00:26:25
Deconstructing the effects of dominant discourse about what is normal 

00:26:25
TRANDA Well, I don't worry about people thinking it's weird, um. That's one of the things that my mother always said, she said, you know as long as you're okay with it, then nothing else matters. 

00:26:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Don't change for others. 

00:26:40
TRANDA No. 

00:26:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Are there things that people have said to you, um, about how you should behave, or not behave since her death? Um, in connection with her? 

00:26:55
Invites Tranda to objectify the discourse rather than be objectified by it 

00:26:55
TRANDA No. I don't think so. 

00:27:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Okay. 

00:27:00
TRANDA See, see because I think, um. I just hold on to that, that statement that I said previously, that no one changes me, and, um, if I want to interact with someone I'll interact, if I don't feel like it then I won't, however that person, however that person may feel about it. 

00:27:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right, right. 

00:27:20
TRANDA Neither here or there, but that's just who I am. And I think that that has gotten even stronger as I've gotten older, um. Not to be stubborn, that's, not, I wouldn't say that I'm stubborn. I, I just, I don't want anyone to think that they can change me. 

00:27:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mhmm. 

00:27:40
TRANDA You know. And so I'm very comfortable with who I am. 

00:27:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. And, Tranda, that includes how you connect with your mom now. 

00:27:50
TRANDA Mhmm. 

00:27:50
Expanding opportunities for the story of connection 

00:27:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. Are there other places, other times, other ways, that besides hearing her voice where you have a sense of being connected with your mom? 

00:28:00
TRANDA Well I keep her photo on my refrigerator, ah, that's the photo that they, they had on, um, you know, the, when she passed away, they do that program, I don't exactly know what you call it, but, um, and I, and I, and I look at that photo on a regular basis, it's in my kitchen, on my refrigerator, and I look at her smile, and it's very, it's kinda like ah, a shy smile, which, which reminds me a lot of my youngest's smile. And, um, my mother's not always been with me, um, one thing that I, I, I, I hope that will never happen, is that as, as I get older that I can't hear her voice anymore. That frightens me a little bit. So I wanna always hear her voice. 

00:28:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Okay. 

00:28:50
TRANDA And I, and I, sometimes I worry if I haven't heard it in a while, sometimes I try to sit and bring it. 

00:28:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mm, I was wondering, yeah, if you actively work at inviting it. 

00:29:00
Safeguarding against her mother's voice disappearing 

00:29:00
TRANDA That, that never happens, it only comes, I think, when I need it. So, I'm hoping, um, as long as I'm on this earth, that I can always hear her voice. Because I think she has definitely contributed to who I am as an individual, um, not just her, but just things that we've been through. 

00:29:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

00:29:25
TRANDA Um, you know, growing up and stuff, so. 

00:29:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. Have you told other people about, um, that special connection you have with her now, and, and, ah, being able to be calmed by her voice? 

00:29:35
Expanding the audience who can relate to her mother 

00:29:35
TRANDA I told my husband, that she wakes me up, he's like, "She wakes you up?" He can't relate, really. Um, but, um, but I even told him that sometimes, and I'm sure it's just not me, that I could be, um, at an airport, maybe waiting for my next flight, and I feel like I've been there before. 

00:29:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mhmm, mhmm. 

00:30:00
TRANDA And, um, there have been times, even when I was younger, that I'm at a place, a location, and I feel like I've been there before. It's kind of a weird feeling. Unless you, it happens to you, you don't, you can't really connect with that kinda thinking. But, um, I've always somewhat been different, so. 

00:30:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE And, um, this is something that is suitable for you. 

00:30:25
TRANDA Mhmm, I'm okay with it. 

00:30:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. And your mom would be okay with it. 

00:30:30
Looking for validation rather than pathologizing 'difference' 

00:30:30
TRANDA Yeah. 

00:30:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Um, your kids, um, how, um, do they continue to have that place of connection with their mom, excuse me their grandmom, your mom. 

00:30:40
Weaving the deceased into relationship across the generations 

00:30:40
TRANDA See, that's, that has always been an issue, my kids have never really been able to connect, because of the distance. You know, my entire family's in Florida, and my husband's family is from Philadelphia. 

00:30:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:30:55
TRANDA So they don't really have a real good sense of family, and I think, in all the hustle and bustle of life, that my husband and I are working, you know, doing things, we didn't, we didn't, um, create opportunities for that, because of the, the distance. 

00:31:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Sure. 

00:31:15
TRANDA And they've really missed out on that. 

00:31:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Are there stories that you want them to know, or lessons that your mother taught you that you want your kids, um, to hold close as well? 

00:31:25
Invites reflection on where legacies have been passed on 

00:31:25
TRANDA I, I'm hoping that, um, that they learn to be okay with who they are, and I'm hoping that I'm able to do that, because, I got that from my mom. 

00:31:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mhmm. 

00:31:45
TRANDA And I'm kinda passing that along to them, you know, um. My kids are, have very different personalities. Um, my oldest is somewhat of, um, an introvert, which is totally different from me. And my youngest is somewhat like that. My 21-year-old is very bubbly and very outgoing. I mean, he can meet you right on the street, and he's like your best friend. Um, which is a good thing. Because they're just different. So, I want from, from what I got from my mom, and what I can give them is that I want them to be okay with who they are. 

00:32:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:32:25
TRANDA Um, and I, I think I can appreciate who they are, their differences, so. 

00:32:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. Do you have a sense of them having that connection, that, ah, being okay with who they are, and having that, um, connection to their grandmother? As a teaching of hers? 

00:32:45
TRANDA I don't think they, they, they, they connect that with, with my mom. I think they connect it with me. 

00:32:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mhmm. 

00:32:50
TRANDA Um, but I don't think that they know that that's somewhat of a carryover from their grandmother. I really don't think so. 

00:33:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

00:33:00
TRANDA Um, um, but. I think it's important for them to really realize that they need to be okay with who they are. 

00:33:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mhmm, right, right. So, if your mom could make commentary on our conversation, what would she say that she liked so far about what we're talking about? And what might she say she is, um, maybe not so crazy about? 

00:33:25
Bringing mother's subjunctive voice into the present conversation 

00:33:25
TRANDA Um, I think she would appreciate the fact that, um, that even though she wasn't the kind of person that would say, "Okay, I'm a hard worker, and I'm raising 12 kids myself and I want everybody to take notice,"... 

00:33:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:33:45
TRANDA She wasn't that kind of a person. So I think that she would appreciate all the things that she's given me, because of what she was doing. Not that she wanted an award or anything like that. 

00:33:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, yeah. 

00:33:55
TRANDA But I think she would appreciate hearing the fact that I still need her. 

00:34:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

00:34:00
TRANDA Um, and I think that's a carryover from appreciating who she was as a person, um, and mind you again, it wasn't like she had tons of time. 

00:34:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:34:10
TRANDA You know, that, that, she, she didn't, I mean my mother, um, worked probably longer than she should have, and my mother died of bladder cancer, which is, um, related to being exposed to chemicals, and it was chemicals as, you know, things that she used as being a maid, and things like that, and... 

00:34:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right, right. 

00:34:35
TRANDA And so I think she would appreciate the fact that she influenced me, and, um. 

00:34:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Would she be surprised? 

00:34:40
TRANDA I think she would be surprised to, um, realize the extent of it. See, because probably in her mind, you know, while we were growing up, she worked all the time, so... 

00:35:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:35:00
TRANDA Maybe she didn't have a lot of time. 

00:35:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:35:05
TRANDA But, I knew to do my homework, and just because she wasn't standing over me, you know... 

00:35:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:35:10
TRANDA ...while I was doing it, I knew I better have that homework done. 

00:35:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:35:15
TRANDA That's for sure. And I don't think that she would have realized that she influenced me in that way. And again, it wasn't a, like a, um, a physical thing, or any of that. 

00:35:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE It wasn't intimidation. 

00:35:30
TRANDA No. 

00:35:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

00:35:30
TRANDA Um, so I don't think that she, in hearing this conversation, that she would really realize how much she influenced me. And it was just the little things in life. And, um, the little messages, and the little things. Um, and I think she would appreciate that. I, I don't think that she would disagree with anything, or be uncomfortable with anything we discussed. 

00:35:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Um, I was thinking that, um, it would almost be as if that she was touched by hearing these stories, kind of like, um, the, I'm thinking of, in my mommy heart, you know, would be kind of, you know pleased. Is that...? 

00:36:05
Re-membering acknowledges the rich significance of even ordinary moments of life 

00:36:05
TRANDA I think she would be, I think she would be pleased, um. But in my mind I knew my mother, she knew that I could be, make a difference, you know, and, um, and carry that on throughout my life, and, um, I think if it wasn't for her, that underlining approval, and, and pushing me, um, I could have went either way, I mean, you know. Um, but I, I think I respected her enough that, um, she knew, she knew. 

00:36:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE You had mentioned previously, Tranda, about not wanting to disappoint, um, and that's how the food was, was cooked every day, because nobody wanted to disappoint mom. 

00:37:00
Inquiry into ongoing significance of an earlier story 

00:37:00
TRANDA Mhmm. 

00:37:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Um, has that been a helpful piece in your life, to not disappoint her in terms of the choices you have made? 

00:37:10
TRANDA All my choices have been good. 

00:37:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, no. 

00:37:10
TRANDA So, um, but, I think... 

00:37:20
[sil.] 

00:37:20
TRANDA I think, at a time in my life, you know, the years from high school and going into college, I definitely didn't want to disappoint her, I just wanted to make her happy. 

00:37:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Okay. Tranda, when you graduate from this program, um, and get your, um, counseling degree, um, what do you think your mother would be saying about that, at that moment? 

00:37:45
Constructing a preferred future and building in relationship with her Mom 

00:37:45
TRANDA Um. 

00:37:50
[sil.] 

00:37:50
TRANDA I, I probably, she, she would probably, um, be happy, I mean, you know, because I've always done what I wanted to do. Even when I was in her house, and breaking rules, you know, I always wanted to do what I, but, you know, whatever I set my mind to do, I always completed it. 

00:38:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:38:10
TRANDA And I think that she would be proud to, to know that at my age going back to school, that I could actually be, um, successful. 

00:38:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE How's this conversation going for you, in talking about her, and all the things we've talked about? 

00:38:25
Gives Tranda some editorial control of the conversation - a reflexive question 

00:38:25
TRANDA Um, I think it's great, I don't get an opportunity to talk about my mom like this to, to even my husband, I don't think he could probably... I mean it's not, it's just something that... This is good, this is good because my mother is very important to me. 

00:38:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE I hear that. 

00:38:45
TRANDA Even in death. 

00:38:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yes, yes. 

00:38:45
TRANDA And, um, I think it's good. It's always good to kind of talk about things, you know, and, um. So. 

00:38:55
Allows her to add in anything that has been overlooked 

00:38:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Are there things that I've not asked you about who she is, either while she was alive or in her connection to you since her death, that you want to make sure that we touch on as things that are important? 

00:39:10
TRANDA Mm. I just wanna say too that, um, even though my mom was a hard worker, and, just like everybody, she makes mistakes, you know, and growing up, you know, and, um, not really, um, making great choices in, in, in husbands, or boyfriends, or whatever, um, and sometimes I think... Um, at one point in my life, very bad mistake, very bad marriage, very mean person, and, um, um. But I don't, none of that changes about who she was as a person and what she actually, the, she, what I value about her. 

00:40:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

00:40:00
TRANDA Because I, I, as I've have gotten older, I kind of realize that the relationships, and the ones that she'd been into, that was just her way of, again, trying to take care of her kids. And so, as I've gotten older, I've kind of realized that, and, in one episode in my life, one step-father in my life that I could probably do without. And, um, when I was younger I couldn't really understand that, but as I've gotten older, I kind of look back on that, and it was just survival. 

00:40:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. So your understanding of your mom has changed as, um, you've gone through your life, is that right? 

00:40:40
TRANDA 'Cause when I was younger I couldn't really... 

00:40:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Sure. 

00:40:40
TRANDA ...really understand why she would actually marry such a mean person, and, and subject us to that, that person, but, um, I look back on it, and I, and I think it was just survival. 

00:40:55
People's lives are always multi-storied 

00:40:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mm. What difference has it made for you, um, to know that story has more than one meaning? 

00:41:05
TRANDA I think if nothing else, it's shown me that, um, that I have to be strong, um, that I have to be able to stand on my own, and can't... Stand on my own, but be a part of a relationship, a partnership. My husband and I've been married for 27 years, but if he were to go, leave, today, I can survive. And so I'm very comfortable with that. And I think that that, what I've, what my mom has shown me in what she had to go through, is that I had never really wanted to, to be in, ah, her situation. 

00:41:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:41:35
TRANDA You know, to be honest with you. 

00:41:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right, right. 

00:41:40
TRANDA And so I think that's one of the reasons why I've worked so hard to get where I am today is because I, I can survive on my own. 

00:41:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Has, ah, there been, ah, um, I'm hearing that, um, correctly, that there's been places where noticing her struggles had been, um, inspirational for you, I don't know if that word fits or not. 

00:42:05
The absent but implicit: new meaning is formed from life's hardships 

00:42:05
TRANDA Well I, I would say, um, um, noticing what she had to go through to care for her kids, has made me stronger. And I think that's made me work hard, that if I had to, I could, I could take care of me and my kids, you know, and... 

00:42:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Sure. 

00:42:20
TRANDA And not have to just, um, be in a relationship for the sake of being in a relationship for financial reasons. 

00:42:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:42:30
TRANDA Um. So. I don't think she really realized that what we, what I saw growing up, at one episode in my life, that that has made me even stronger, and has made me, you know, strive to be the best that I can be. And I always tell people that. And, so. 

00:42:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE So same question, then, if she were listening to what you just said, what would she say, what would about, um, how she knows you to be, is that a fitting thing, that you have used places that were difficult, as guiding points in your life. 

00:43:10
TRANDA How would she feel about it? 

00:43:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mhmm. 

00:43:10
TRANDA I think she would be okay. I mean, I've always been very honest. You know, even growing up, I mean, you know, she asked me a question, I'd just be honest, you know, and so I think she would appreciate it. I, I don't, it, it may bother her a bit, um, but I think that she can get past that. 

00:43:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Okay. 

00:43:35
TRANDA Um. 'Cause if it was the other way around, that it made me weak, of course I think it would bother her a little bit more. 

00:43:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right, right. 

00:43:40
TRANDA I think it's just made me stronger. And made me who I am today, so. 

00:43:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Uh-huh. 

00:43:50
TRANDA So I think she could appreciate that. 

00:43:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, yeah. As a hard-working woman. 

00:43:50
TRANDA Very hard, hard-working, um. The only thing that I would change differently from her life to mine, um, is that I, I think she was strong, I just think that, um, I'm sure that financially I can probably survive on my own if I had to. So. No, I think she would appreciate the conversation. 

00:44:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Okay. I'm wondering if this might be, um, a place where we can take a pause, um, we've covered a lot of different things about her, um, and, um, would that be okay? 

00:44:35
TRANDA Yes. 

00:44:35
00׃00׃55׃00 00:00׃55׃00 @ 29fps 00׃01׃04׃29 Disclosing the transporting effect on Lorraine of hearing the re-membering stories 

00:44:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, um, I was just, um, noticing too about, um, the many places for me about hearing the stories, ah, of her, and appreciating, um, what it's like, um, to work so hard and how, um, I was imagining this woman who knew how to kind of, um, keep a lot of chaos under control at times, um, and that must have been an incredibly skillful thing that she would do. Ah, and I was imagining that that must serve you, um, in your life now. Is listening to her voice now still one of the places where you have that honoring of respect? 

00:45:15
TRANDA I think so. I don't think, you know, really in all honesty, I don't think my mother knew how much she has inspired me, to be honest. And, um, and I think that she did a lot, I mean, it wasn't, I can't really put my hand on when I felt it, or how she did it, but I know she did it. 

00:45:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:45:45
TRANDA And, ah, I think that just hearing, we don't, and mind you it's not a, when I hear her voice, she's just calling my name, it's nothing else. 

00:45:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. She's not giving you more words, it's just Tranda. 

00:45:55
TRANDA No, no, it's just, "I'm here." And I, and I think that's what it means. And, um, and it's very calming. And, um, I don't think she knew how much she inspired me. Really. I don't think she knew. 

00:46:10
Lorraine adds to the significance of the story through offering her own response 

00:46:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE She inspires me. 

00:46:10
TRANDA So. 

00:46:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Alright. Thank you. 

00:46:15
TRANDA Oh, you're welcome. 

00:46:20
[sil.] 

00:46:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, Tranda. Well thank you for the chance to listen to your conversation with Lorraine. It was, um, it was good for me to hear, and to learn a little bit about, ah, your mother and your relationship with her. And I guess what I would like to just ask you is about how that experience of having that conversation with Lorraine, how that went for you. 

00:46:45
TRANDA Um, I thought it went well. Um, that's always, um, um, any time I have an opportunity to talk about my mom, I enjoy it. 

00:46:50
JOHN WINSLADE Right, okay. 

00:46:55
TRANDA And, um, so I really enjoyed the conversation. 

00:46:55
JOHN WINSLADE So, I'm interested in what sort of effect it had on you, as you talked about her. 

00:47:05
TRANDA Um, right now I feel a sense of sort of like, um, release, a load, you know, um. 

00:47:10
JOHN WINSLADE Release. 

00:47:10
TRANDA Yeah, it's almost like I feel a little bit lighter. 

00:47:15
JOHN WINSLADE A little lighter, okay. 

00:47:15
TRANDA Yeah. 

00:47:15
JOHN WINSLADE Do you know, have any sense of what actually made it feel like that, like made you feel a little lighter, is there anything in particular? 

00:47:25
TRANDA Um, I think it could have been that I, I'm, I'm just, um, proud of my mom? 

00:47:30
JOHN WINSLADE Hmm. 

00:47:35
TRANDA And, um, and it was great to kinda share, um, about my experiences with her growing up. 

00:47:45
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:47:45
TRANDA Um, and, and it also felt good that other people felt she was a good person. 

00:47:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:47:50
TRANDA And, just based on, you know, the information that I was sharing, so. 

00:47:55
JOHN WINSLADE So does that make a difference to you, to have other people kinda notice that and share your pride with her? 

00:48:00
TRANDA I think so. 

00:48:00
JOHN WINSLADE Like what kind of difference does it make? 

00:48:00
TRANDA Well, I think it's always good, I mean, when I, when I think about how I want people to remember me... 

00:48:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:48:10
TRANDA I, I would like them to remember me as a caring individual. 

00:48:15
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:48:15
TRANDA A person who has worked hard, um, and so I think that was my mom. And so, I kinda want people to remember that. And that, and when they see me, I'm somewhat of a reflection of how she raised me. 

00:48:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:48:30
TRANDA And so, it's always good, I think, to, to share and... 

00:48:35
JOHN WINSLADE If I'm understanding that, it's like you're, you experienced a sort of a, a strength of that legacy, and the, the, kind of like you felt it inside as you talked. 

00:48:45
TRANDA Mhmm. 

00:48:45
JOHN WINSLADE And both your pride in your mom and also the sense in which you were carrying on things that were important for her, is that, is that, as you talked, that kind of sense of that became clearer or stronger, or is that, is that, am I putting words in your mouth or is that right? 

00:49:00
TRANDA No, my pride for my mom has always been strong. 

00:49:05
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:49:05
TRANDA But, I like to share how she raised us... 

00:49:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:49:10
TRANDA ...in hopes that people can learn from my experience, and. 

00:49:15
JOHN WINSLADE Yes, yes. 

00:49:15
TRANDA Um, I always tell people that I wake up every morning trying to be the best person that I could be. 

00:49:20
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:49:20
TRANDA And, um, I think that my mom has helped me to be the best person that I could be, and I, and I, if I can share that with others, then that's all well and good. 

00:49:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yup. 

00:49:35
TRANDA And I think that I did that today. 

00:49:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. There's one thing that you said to Lorraine that I just wanted to ask you about. 

00:49:40
TRANDA Mhmm. 

00:49:40
JOHN WINSLADE You said that, near the start of your conversation with her, you talked about, um, having a sense of void with your mom not around. 

00:49:50
TRANDA Mhmm. 

00:49:50
JOHN WINSLADE And I'm wondering, as you had, as you talked with Lorraine, what happened to that sense of void that you spoke about. 

00:49:55
00׃04׃13;19 00:04׃14;03 @ 29fps 00׃04׃37;26 

00:49:55
TRANDA At the moment, I think it, it didn't exist. But it'll always be there. 

00:50:05
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:50:05
TRANDA The void is there, because she's no longer with me. 

00:50:10
JOHN WINSLADE Right, yeah. 

00:50:10
TRANDA Um, I don't think that the void will permanently disappear. 

00:50:10
JOHN WINSLADE Uh huh. 

00:50:15
TRANDA One of the things I think is important too is that as I talk about my mom... 

00:50:20
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm. 

00:50:20
TRANDA Um, I wouldn't say the void, ah, disappears totally. 

00:50:25
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm. 

00:50:25
TRANDA But, um, talking about her helps me. 

00:50:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yes, yes. 

00:50:30
TRANDA Um, um, how, I can't really describe how it helps me, but. She was a good person, and I, you know, if I can tell everybody that I meet about her, then that's, that's a good thing, because I think she was good, and I think that the way she raised us and the things that she tried to teach us, ah, are very good values to, for others to, you know, to use, and hopefully... 

00:50:55
JOHN WINSLADE So it, talking about her actually helps you, rather than causes painful remembering or anything like that? 

00:51:05
TRANDA I think it helps me. 

00:51:05
JOHN WINSLADE It helps you. 

00:51:05
TRANDA Yeah, yeah, I don't, I don't think it caused me... I mean I, I get emotional about it. 

00:51:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:51:10
TRANDA Um, but it gives me a really good feeling. 

00:51:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yes, okay. 

00:51:15
TRANDA That's why when I hear the voice, it doesn't scare me. 

00:51:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, okay. 

00:51:15
TRANDA It comforts me. 

00:51:20
JOHN WINSLADE Yes, yeah. 

00:51:20
TRANDA Um. 

00:51:20
JOHN WINSLADE So would you say talking about her comforts you? 

00:51:25
TRANDA Mhmm. 

00:51:25
JOHN WINSLADE Is that a, a fair summary of what you're saying? 

00:51:25
TRANDA Yeah, I say that's fair. It's just like the voice, it doesn't scare me, even though the voice wakes me up at night. 

00:51:30
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:51:35
TRANDA Not all the time, occasionally. 

00:51:35
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, yeah. 

00:51:35
TRANDA But it doesn't scare me. It's almost comforting, that I know she's still thinking about me, I, you know, when I, and I can clearly, if I concentrate very very hard and close my eyes, I can hear her say my name. 

00:51:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:51:50
TRANDA And, if nothing else, that's one of the things that I, I'm frightened about, is, is one day not being able to close my eyes and concentrate really hard and hear her say my name. 

00:52:00
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. So is that like something that you're consciously trying to do to keep her presence there with you, and to honor it when it's there? I mean I know you, you spoke about how you don't deliberately invite her... 

00:52:10
TRANDA Right. 

00:52:10
JOHN WINSLADE ...to speak to you, but still you're kind of open to it all the time. 

00:52:15
TRANDA Because I want it to stay with me. 

00:52:15
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:52:20
TRANDA And I feel like if I don't try occasionally to bring it back, then I'll, it'll disappear. 

00:52:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:52:25
TRANDA And I don't want it to disappear. 

00:52:25
JOHN WINSLADE And is that part of why you volunteered to do this today? 

00:52:30
TRANDA I think it's important. 

00:52:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:52:30
TRANDA It keeps, it keeps her alive, it... 

00:52:35
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:52:35
TRANDA And, ah, I really do think that she was very unique. She may not have thought she was... 

00:52:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:52:40
TRANDA But I think she was. And, um, and I think people could learn from... 

00:52:45
JOHN WINSLADE From you telling the story. Well I wanna thank you for introducing us to her uniqueness. 

00:52:50
TRANDA You're welcome. 

00:52:50
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. And thank you for your participation in this exercise today. 

00:52:55
TRANDA No, I think it's helped me. 

00:53:00
JOHN WINSLADE Great, well great. 

00:53:05
[sil.] 

00:53:05
JOHN WINSLADE So, um, we've, I've listened to your conversation with Tranda, and also had a brief conversation with her. 

00:53:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yes. 

00:53:15
JOHN WINSLADE And I'm also interested in your experience of that interview that you had, that conversation you had with Tranda. 

00:53:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Okay. 

00:53:20
JOHN WINSLADE Tell me about how that went from your perspective. 

00:53:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Okay. Um, I thought it was a lovely conversation. Um, personally, I was, um, just thrilled to meet her mom. Um, you know, I had, you know, lots of places where, um, I imagine that if we weren't doing this for a videotape, that I would have stopped and had kind of these sidebar conversations of saying, you know, "Gosh, your mom sounds like this, that, or the other thing," or just kind of all these visual images that, that, um, were coming to mind for me with her, um, because she sounded like an incredibly wonderful woman. And I, you know, I was really touched to, to hear these things, um, about her. Also, you know, just personally was moved, thinking about, ah, how a mother's love, ah, inspires their children. 

00:54:05
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm. 

00:54:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE You know, and how she would, um, was able to do that with, with 12 kids. 

00:54:10
JOHN WINSLADE What did Tranda say that particularly was impactful for you in that way? Was there anything in particular, any details of words or expressions that she used? 

00:54:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE I, there's a lot of things, um, just talking about how, um, there was times that Tranda felt like giving up, like when she was talking about her experiences at UCLA. 

00:54:30
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm. 

00:54:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE And, um, that she felt like, um, it was too different of an experience, and how it was, ah, her desire to not disappoint her mom, um, that kept her going, and in the end it turned, um, into this wonderful experience of her getting her degree. Um, that opened up these new worlds for her, and I was just thinking about, um, isn't that fantastic, you know, to think about the way in which a parent can, um, almost unwittingly influence, um, a child for the good. You know, that her mother didn't have any idea that just, ah, through her actions of living, that Tranda was able to, um, tap into that strength. 

00:55:15
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm. 

00:55:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE And didn't want to disappoint her. 

00:55:15
JOHN WINSLADE So did that connect with your own experience in life at all? 

00:55:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Well it certainly connects with my own desire as a mother, that I hope that I provide that... 

00:55:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:55:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE ...kind of inspiration, um, you know. I suppose you'll have to ask me that one after I'm dead, whether or not I succeed, but, um, it, I just had that, that hope that I would be able to do that. You know, just in the act of living, that, that my daughter will be inspired by that, so. 

00:55:45
JOHN WINSLADE So, using the word inspired, did you take some inspiration for yourself from what Tranda was saying? 

00:55:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right, just what I was saying, that, um, personally there was that, that piece of inspiration of, um, noticing that I wanna be that good of a mom as, as she was, as her mom was for her. Um, professionally I was inspired, thinking about, um, there's a time, and you picked up on this in your comments with her, right at the beginning of the conversation when Tranda spoke about feeling a void. 

00:56:20
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm. 

00:56:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Um, but what I noticed, um, and she was concerned that she might cry. 

00:56:25
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm. 

00:56:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE You know, that she had mentioned that when we were kind of getting ready, and what I noticed was that throughout the conversation, that she actually was very joyous, in what she was sharing, and I kept wondering about that, about how, um, her experience of the actual conversation was different from what she was fearful was gonna happen or anticipating might happen, if she talked about her mom and, and, and ended up crying. And... 

00:56:55
JOHN WINSLADE So what do you think about that, having a conversation that is about grief and the experience of someone who's died who's close to you, that ends up being joyous. I mean, is that common, or intentional, or... 

00:57:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Both. 

00:57:05
JOHN WINSLADE ...something you would want to happen, or... 

00:57:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yes. 

00:57:05
JOHN WINSLADE ...think happens often, or what? 

00:57:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE All of the above. Yes. 

00:57:10
JOHN WINSLADE Why so? 

00:57:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Um, I think, um, depending on what we speak about, um, that, that we can access and, um, highlight different aspects of the stories. 

00:57:20
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm. 

00:57:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE So if, had I gone in to the conversation when Tranda said that she felt a void with her mom's passing, and I'm sure she does feel that, as many people do. Had I gone in sort of asking her to explain what that void felt like, or to describe that sense of missing, I think she would have been in tears. 

00:57:40
JOHN WINSLADE It would have grown the sense of void. 

00:57:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE It would have grown the sense of yearning, and longing, and pain. Um, but because I didn't highlight that, um, and just acknowledged, yes, that's a part of it, but instead talked about the many different ways in which she connects, and the many different ways in which she hears her mom's voice, um, that she experiences this sense of joy. 

00:58:00
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm. 

00:58:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Um, and that the conversation, you know, she, the phrase she used with you in the, when she was reflecting was how she felt, um, less burdened, or, ah, less heavy. 

00:58:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:58:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Anyway. 

00:58:15
JOHN WINSLADE Lighter. 

00:58:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Lighter. Um, and that's my experience of remembering conversations, is that it produces that sense of lightness. 

00:58:20
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm. 

00:58:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE You know, um, which is a lovely thing to think about, you know, the, the intensity of, of grief as being very heavy and dark and difficult, and when we remember a person, um, that it actually, it produces this experience of lightness. And, you know, that's powerful for me. 

00:58:40
JOHN WINSLADE There's one thing I wanted to ask you about, was the, the sort of development and movement that I saw in the questions that you were asking. 

00:58:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Okay. 

00:58:45
JOHN WINSLADE Um, early on, you were asking about, her to tell you stories of her mother. 

00:58:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yes. 

00:58:55
JOHN WINSLADE And as time went on, you were asking some different questions, which were more about, more and more about what her mother would say now. 

00:59:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yes. 

00:59:05
JOHN WINSLADE As opposed to what life was like, what her mother used to say back in the past. 

00:59:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yes. 

00:59:10
JOHN WINSLADE Can you speak to that movement of, of time through the conversation? 

00:59:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Um, initially, in a remembering conversation I want to get a sense of who the person was when they were living. 

00:59:20
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm. 

00:59:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE It helps me contextualize the relationship, it helps me to find, um, points of entry into the stories. 

00:59:25
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm. 

00:59:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Um, gives me a sense, it puts flesh onto the bones... 

00:59:30
OHN WINSLADE Mhmm. 

00:59:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE ...you know, of the deceased. Um, but it is not only about that. Remembering cannot only be about what has happened before. It has to be about what is happening now, and what's gonna happen in the future. And so I take that flesh that we put on, on the bones of her mother, and talk about, then, how, um, she features into Tranda's life. And so I want to bring her into the present conversation by asking her to speak about what her mother were listening now, um, what might she say, using that kind of subjunctive, um, verb text, so that we can, can imagine her as being a part of the conversation and featuring into it. Um, and almost creating some spaces of normalization of that, if you will. And saying, you know, this, that would be actually my version of acceptance, is, you know, saying that we want her voice included in there. 

01:00:25
JOHN WINSLADE That's an interesting use of the word remembering, because most people don't think of remembering as being something that is... 

01:00:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

01:00:35
JOHN WINSLADE ...oriented to the future, only to the past. 

01:00:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right, right. And I think of remembering as a very active, um, process, that is about construction of a future, as opposed to kind of, um, reminiscing on what has happened, um, and the stories that used to be or, kind of, um, what Meyerhoff talks about, about fragmentary flickerings. You know, I think of it as the active calling forth, it is the conjuring, um, of a person's life, from the past, into the present, to carry it into the future. 

01:01:05
JOHN WINSLADE Um, and, as time went by, too, you were more, not just telling stories about things that happened, but also stories of identity. 

01:01:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yes. 

01:01:15
JOHN WINSLADE Seem to emerge more and more. 

01:01:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yes, um. 

01:01:15
JOHN WINSLADE I mean, Tranda was speaking about those right from early on in the conversation. 

01:01:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yes. 

01:01:20
JOHN WINSLADE But you were inviting them forward over time, much more fully, it seemed. 

01:01:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Mhmm. 

01:01:25
JOHN WINSLADE Do you want to speak to what your intention is in doing that? 

01:01:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Well, I want to, um, it, actively, ah, interweave the voice of her mother in, into her sense of herself. 

01:01:45
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm. 

01:01:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE You know, so her mother, um, saw things in her, that, believed in her, was able to, um, you know, had those kind of, um, background voice of you can do this, right. 

01:01:55
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

01:02:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Even, you know, let's use that strong- willedness... 

01:02:00
JOHN WINSLADE The calm voice. 

01:02:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE The calm voice, um, to say that, that you, you can put one foot in front of the other. 

01:02:05
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm. 

01:02:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE And so I wanted to, um, interweave those stories, um, so that, that Tranda never has a place of losing them. You know, she talked at one point about how, um, her sons, um, we think of the stories not coming from the grandmother but coming from Tranda. 

01:02:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

01:02:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE And I was thinking, that's fantastic, you know, that, that place of story has become interwoven, um, with Tranda's kind of DNA strands. 

01:02:35
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm. 

01:02:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE You know, so that her mother is inseparable from her, in that regard. And so those identity stories, um, become those places that are, um, important for her to always access as, as something that's with her. 

01:02:50
JOHN WINSLADE So rather than just being a legacy from the past, it's something that's still alive and keeps growing, in a sense. 

01:02:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, yeah, yeah. Forever. 

01:03:00
JOHN WINSLADE So, before we, um, finish this conversation, is there anything else that you would like to say about what happened in that conversation with Tranda that kinda you were left with? 

01:03:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Um, nothing really off hand that I can think of, um, I was just really, um, thrilled as I said, and, um, honored to, to meet her mom. 

01:03:25
JOHN WINSLADE Mhmm. I felt the same thing listening to it. 

01:03:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Did you? 

01:03:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

01:03:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

01:03:35
JOHN WINSLADE It was quite a special invitation to, um, to understand something of a unique woman and her contribution to Tranda's life, but also an ongoing contribution, 'cause it was not just, it was with her children, but it was with other people as well. 

01:03:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

01:03:50
JOHN WINSLADE She was saying things like, "I am a giver." 

01:03:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

01:03:55
JOHN WINSLADE For example. 

01:03:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right, right. Yeah, the story that she told about, ah, feeding the man who came into the kitchen. 

01:04:00
JOHN WINSLADE That's right. 

01:04:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE And I was thinking this is a woman who, who had a, a tremendous amount of calmness. 

01:04:05
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

01:04:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE And strength. 

01:04:05
JOHN WINSLADE And I'm sure we could talk a lot more about what went into that. 

01:04:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, yes. 

01:04:10
JOHN WINSLADE But perhaps that's enough for today. 

01:04:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

01:04:15
JOHN WINSLADE Thank you. 

01:04:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, thank you. 

01:04:20
