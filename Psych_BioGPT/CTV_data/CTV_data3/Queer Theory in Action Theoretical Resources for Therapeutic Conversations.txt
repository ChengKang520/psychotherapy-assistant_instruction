Microtraining Associates Presents Queer Theory In Action: Theoretical Resources for Therapeutic Conversations Julie Tilsen Ph.D and David Nylund Ph.D Part One This video begins with an introduction to Queer Theory and asks the following questions to the authors, Julie Tilsen and David Nylund... Can you define "queer"? What is meant by "the social construction of gender"? What is the "gender binary"? What are your earliest memories of the gender binary? What if society could move beyond the constriction of the gender binary? What would you like counselors/therapists to take away from watching this? Following the introduction to Queer Theory are two counseling sessions. The first is with Julie Tilsen, who counsels Tighearnan. They talk about a variety of ways he might stay connected to his Mom across differences. The second session is with David Nylund, who counsels Gwen. They discuss gender transition and identity. Following each session is a reflection about the session and their experience. These counseling sessions are with real clients. They are not actors. They are sharing their own personal stories. Can you define "queer"? 

00:01:50
JULIE TILSEN Well, I think what's interesting and, and tricky, uhm, about defining queer is that queer itself is something that resists definition and as much as a definition of something that, uhm, is static or sedimentizes of something in place. Uhm, that queer is, uhm, a critic of such things, uhm, and in terms of identities-- it's a critic of identities itself or identity categories. So queer is about fluidity, and motion and unpredictability and resisting and challenging, ah, ah, cultural norms, normativity convention. So having set all of that, ah, that, that the queer would stand a resistance of definition, what I can say is that some of the definitions that, uhm, it has, uhm, had applied to it, uhm, include, you know, something that I think a lot of people would be familiar with, uhm, his queer being of, of a, a negative, ah, pejorative epithet used, uhm, to describe anybody that's kind of odd, queer, extrens-- centric. Uhm, sitting outside of norms that probably makes, uhm, other people want comfortable, uhm, probably kind of old school used that way, and then more specifically that sort of pejorative use became, uhm, uhm, aimed, ah, at sexual minority so people that we now, ah, would categorize as gay, lesbian by sexual perhaps what we now know as called transgender, queer gender, queer people, uhm, so became specific, ah, as a pejorative towards those folks. And then, uhm, as definitions turn, uhm, ah, often pejoratives are taken and embraced by, uhm, the groups that they have been used against and what we call, we call reverse discourse, so people that have been called queer in a hurtful oppressive way, gay, lesbian, bisexual trans folks, uhm, took the word queer as sort of a reclamation as a way to organize and identity, uhm, that, ah, rather than challenging the use of the word queer and trying to get rid of it and take something else up, uhm, they say "Okay, I we're queer and this is what we, this is something we celebrating within your body". And I think another definition of queer, the way queer has been used as that has occurred is something that again happens historically, uhm, within, ah, marginalized communities, activist communities, the language of those communities becomes commodified and taken up for, ah, more dominant and, uhm, ah, uhm, consumer purposes. So you see that in like what the queer is a straight guy, queerest folk, so popular things that, that, that permeate popular cultural and become available to everybody. Uhm, so it becomes commodified and then that takes away, uhm, much of the radical and political intentionality that queer, ah, was also intended to be about. 

00:05:25
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

00:05:25
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, and leave people to think, ah, that they have an idea what queer is or who queers are, uhm, and it sort of ends up being well that's good gay folk. Uhm, I had-- I had a young person say to me once about the show queer as folk that they should just called a gay as folk. Uhm, and that's because that young person... 

00:05:45
DAVID NYLUND White gay as folk. 

00:05:45
JULIE TILSEN Ah? 

00:05:45
DAVID NYLUND White gay as folk. 

00:05:45
JULIE TILSEN White gay as folk. White, middle-class or better gay as folk, right. And the segway from that thought in terms of where that young person was coming from, I think is what we share in terms of how we think about and want to organize around queer is its history of being, uhm, about embracing the idea of being outside and resisting those conventions that's so very politically, intentionally political and radical. 

00:06:15
DAVID NYLUND Wow! 

00:06:20
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, so, negative epithet for anybody who stands outside of convention, ah, then more particularly deployed against sexual minorities, uhm, take, taken up as an activist position, ah, to challenge, uhm, uhm, norm activity, but then commodified by popular mainstream consumer culture, and then what we also see again is, uhm, it sort of being taken up as an umbrella term what you'll see a lot in popular literature and a lot of mainstream practice. 

00:06:55
DAVID NYLUND Uhm. 

00:06:55
JULIE TILSEN Practice literature is the word queer used as an umbrella term for LGBT people, which again kind of takes away its radical, uhm, intentions of - 

00:07:10
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

00:07:10
JULIE TILSEN - destabilizing convention. 

00:07:10
DAVID NYLUND Sure. 

00:07:15
JULIE TILSEN So. 

00:07:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. I, I to actually I that think, uhm - 

00:07:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:07:15
DAVID NYLUND - that, ah, the way we understand queer is that it's less of a sexual orientation and more of political orientation. It's critique in identity and the limits of identity, that sexuality for instance is too fluid, a desire can't be captured by identity category. Uhm, there is a great quote from a colleague, uhm, Cathy Ruby who says that, ah, being queer is not matter of being gay, ah, there is no foolproof membership to queerness other than the willingness to seek out resistance as cite to normativity whenever and wherever possible. So... 

00:08:00
What is "queer theory"? 

00:08:05
DAVID NYLUND It, it's drawing upon what we're discussing. Queer theory has a lot of different historical trajectories. Uhm, there is a group of scholars in the late 80s , early 90s that found that gay-lesbian studies were somewhat limiting and it address only issues of sexual identity and gender identity, uhm, as if it existed in isolation to other, ah, identity categories like race, class, ah, post colonialism, colonialism. So, they were drawing upon some work, uhm, (inaudible ) of course history of sexuality one of the key ways of work that they were drawing into, Butler in particular who wrote a book called Gender Trouble. Uhm, where she was one of the first people to use the term queer as an academic inquiry. They were also drawing upon a lot of, uhm, activist circles, queer nation in particular act up who embraced a more radical notion of, of sexual identity as, as a political entity when we were fighting age discrimination and other forms of discrimination against gender and sex minority. So, it was this interesting blind of academics in activist, which was also part of its appeal. Uhm, the main premise of queer theory is the way we understand it, is it's, uhm, making visible, uhm, white is referred to as heteronormativity. The idea that institu-- our institutions, our political structures, the media, relational practices, uhm, are informed by the idea that heterosexuality is a norm, in which everything is compared against. So, it's, it's making visible the construction, the invention of heterosexuality and historicizing sexuality, including the, the invention of, of homosexuality. Uhm, so that's one of its main, ah, uhm, investigations. There is a lot of media criticism of how our media representations reinforced heteronormativity and what ways that they're disrupted. A new body of work that's emerging out of that is also exposing how mainstream homosexual identity, gay and lesbian identity is mimicking traditional heterosexuality. So, a term coined by another colleague Lisa Duggan came up with the term homonormativity, which is a, ah, homosexual identity that's anchored in domesticity and consumption is, is depoliticized. That's some of the main work. I think the other appeal as I said earlier with queer theory, ah, at least the scholar said we most connect with is how sexual and gender identity is, ah, intersecting with issues around politics, race, gender, class, post colonialism, the, the postcolonial subject in non-western cultures. 

00:11:00
What is meant by the "social construction of gender"? 

00:11:10
JULIE TILSEN You know, basically I think perhaps the main idea to hang on to when we talk about anything being socially constructed is this idea that things are not natural in the sense that we're just born with them and that they're universal, and they're universally experienced and understood across time and place. Uhm, so, social construction is a way of locating, in this case your question, the idea of gender within, uhm, times or historical time and place, cultural place, so that we understand that gender as we, and I might talk about it today here in North America in an urban, in an urban setting in the United States in 2010 is not the understanding that someone across the world in a different context may understand gender. Uhm, and in, uhm, it's not what my mom understood, ah, at, at-- as an 88-year-old woman, growing up in the same urban center that I did and attending the same high school, uhm, gender meant something very different for her, you know graduating from Minneapolis West in 1930, something that I did for me in 1980, uhm, in terms of what was expected and allowed for men and women, uhm, what was available to them, what ideas were conjured, what shared meetings(ph) there were or there were assumed to be. Uhm, so, for us, what's important about that is this destabilizing the idea that, that everybody knows what gender is and experiences at the same way and understanding that it's something that is, that comes into being, that is made real and then reified through language practices, how we talk about something, the meaning that gets constructed around it and how we interact with each other around those things. So, dominant notions of gender in any particular time and place are constructed through relationship, through conversation, language practices that either reify particular meanings as central and assumed and then they become naturalized unquestioned, and then other meanings as being non-available, uhm, or not okay. Uhm, so... 

00:14:00
DAVID NYLUND Hmm. Hmm. 

00:14:00
JULIE TILSEN It's so-- basically it's that challenging of naturalization and understanding the things are, are culturally and historically contention. 

00:14:10
DAVID NYLUND And, and we think it's useful in a clinical practice if, if gender is not natural, if it's situated, then, uhm - 

00:14:20
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

00:14:20
DAVID NYLUND - one can, with our clients can bring forth other performances and constructions of gender that are less limiting, that move outside the gender straightjacket or what we call the gender binary. 

00:14:35
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:14:35
DAVID NYLUND So, that's why I think it opens up possibilities, as supposed to like men are naturally more leaders or women are naturally more, ah, nurturing, uhm, that's, that stereotype can actually reinforce and specify and limit people's, uhm, view themselves in their gender identity. 

00:14:55
JULIE TILSEN And that speaks to social construction is understanding that, you know our received view of language, what we think is how language operates is that it's just descriptive. But with also constructionism says is that language is productive. It produces those meanings and knowledges and then it reifies and then reproduces them as we circulate them - 

00:15:15
DAVID NYLUND Hmm...Hmm... 

00:15:15
JULIE TILSEN - amongst ourselves. And in terms of practice, uhm, what's important for us is this idea even just saying men and women, our language is self-centered around men and women that, that becomes reproductive of, of this regulation and, and that could-- sign would say that the limits of my language is the limits of my world, and so as we produce through language, these categories... 

00:15:45
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

00:15:45
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, it, it limits what people think their options are and it also doesn't account for that, that there are people that, that live outside of those limits. 

00:15:55
DAVID NYLUND Yeah! 

00:15:55
JULIE TILSEN But we don't have the language to, ah, give them voice, uhm, and to help them, help us see them. 

00:16:05
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

00:16:05
JULIE TILSEN And outcome speak into their experience. So... 

00:16:05
DAVID NYLUND Yeah! 

00:16:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah! 

00:16:10
DAVID NYLUND I agree. 

00:16:10
What is the "gender binary"? 

00:16:15
DAVID NYLUND It, it's thinking upon what just Julie said is, our language practices a lot of the western languages including English. 

00:16:25
JULIE TILSEN Hmm-hmm. 

00:16:25
DAVID NYLUND Our structure through binary, so it's hard to escape binary thinking, because of the language and its limitation such as, ah, good, bad, white, black, woman, man. So, as it relates to the gender binary, it's the assumption that there are only two genders or two sexes, man and woman. And that again limits the ways we can think about gender and sexuality. And it doesn't account for the multiple, ah, sex-- sexualities or sexes and genders that science illustrates. There is a great-- a great quote from a scientist in a, uhm, documentary film, Middlesex, which is different from the novel. 

00:17:10
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

00:17:10
DAVID NYLUND That science loves variation, humans do not. So, uhm, our work, a lot of the work in queer theory is to make visible again the multiple, ah, sexes and genders and to not pathologize it, because when our disciplines, uhm, psychology, social work, etcetera, uhm, are structured through the bi-- the binary then anybody who falls outside of that binary, uhm, or above the binary or between is often pathologized including the DSM category gender identity disorder. So, our, our work is to expose that in the limitations of that binary, and how it pulls us into gender straightjackets and to loosen a little bit to, to trait some fissures and crevasses on that binary. 

00:18:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, we propose that the GID is re-termed or renamed Gender Inflexibility Disorder. 

00:18:05
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

00:18:05
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

00:18:10
DAVID NYLUND That's going to be in DSM 12. 

00:18:10
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

00:18:15
What are some of your earliest memories of the gender binary? 

00:18:20
DAVID NYLUND Some of my earliest memories growing up. I grew up in working class Detroit. Uhm, we lived in a, uhm, the first ring suburb outside Detroit. And, uhm, when I was three or four, I remember, uhm, asking my mom to give me some Barbie's, so went on and bought some Barbie's. And, uhm, my dad found out that's same day and became incredibly enraged with my mom, and was at least verbally abusive. I don't know if there is more and went out and bought some Gi Joes and took the, uhm, Barbie's away from me. So, I remember being really sacred of, uhm, my dad because of that and also like, okay, I guess there are certain things that I'm interested in and I can't have, because I am a boy. And then, as I got older and went to school, to kindergarten, I found out those same limitations and so in response to that I found you know, if I talked sports, that was sports corrective and measure or move then, then I somehow was in the boys club. Uhm, because I got tired of, uhm, being called a Sissy or smear the queer. So that, that was-- that's what, uhm, really had an inference on me that I think drew me eventually to, uhm, some of the ideas we're talking about. 

00:19:50
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, you know, I, uhm, I, I certainly remember as a little kid, you know I was dubbed a tomboy and that wasn't necessarily a bad thing, uhm, but it was a different thing. And you know as-- you know, when we-- we're going back, uhm, you know, 40, 40 years, uhm, looking back at these times, you know 30, 40 years, uhm, it's certainly constructing these memories with some of these ideas that I have now, but it was a different thing and in some things it was cool, because you know I could throw a softball 100 feet and I could throw a football through a tire hanging on a rope in a tree with a perfect spiral and you know. 

00:20:40
DAVID NYLUND Wow, I couldn't do that! 

00:20:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, I know you couldn't. And I could sit in-- sit in the driveway and, and make, uhm, and chalk on the-- on the patio wall, target and sit there and flip wrist shots and slap shots and get, get into the center, uhm, you know. 

00:20:55
DAVID NYLUND Hang around. 

00:20:55
JULIE TILSEN Shoot scores. Yeah. You know, I could do those things. And I had some cache. Uhm, and, and yet you know on my jean jacket, my mom brought this patch with the, the woman sing-- signals and says I'm girl and she showed that on. And, uhm, at that time I was-- I was kind of funny, but now you know I wonder what that was like for her having this little girl that people didn't always know, she was a little girl. And you know, these are just wonderings. But how was that important for her to sort of - 

00:21:30
DAVID NYLUND Right! 

00:21:30
JULIE TILSEN - you know brand me in some way to label that. And then certainly, you know, getting into junior high, in middle school and high school, that's where I think some of those experiences of construction and gender, gender binary and things you're asking about definitely became apparent, because I think you know, we're coming into a sexuality and supposed to be, you know starting to be interested in things. And you know I started noting that, you know girls are supposed to carry the textbooks and stuff, kind of like this and you now if you have a-- hopefully you had-- your, your budding hips, you know kind of carrying there, whereas guys got to, you know hanging down here. And it's like, I would force myself to do this, because this is really fun or I love and comfortable to carry my book that way or, uhm, you know just thinking about a lot about cloths and hair and, uhm, some other things that I was good at doing in sports were still valued, but they needed to be funneled into certain things, uhm, in certain ways. Uhm, and so definitely became more aware of that gaze. 

00:22:40
DAVID NYLUND Hmm. Hmm. 

00:22:40
JULIE TILSEN G-A-Z-E! Uhm, and feeling different and not as attractive or, ah, things like that. Well, also it was-- it was kind of this bifurcated experience, because I was also very smart and popular in some ways and, and involved and you know a leader, but there was this way I know that I was different and didn't, didn't fit in, you know in, in, in, in the, you know the, the Noah's Arking(ph) of paring up kids for, for dances and things like that. 

00:23:15
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

00:23:15
JULIE TILSEN So, I was definitely aware of that. 

00:23:15
DAVID NYLUND Hmm. 

00:23:20
JULIE TILSEN And it was painful at times. 

00:23:20
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

00:23:20
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:23:25
What if society could move beyond the constriction of the gender binary? 

00:23:30
JULIE TILSEN Uhm. Okay! Uhm, well, I think that rather than being a binary system or be a system of, uhm, multiplicity and flexibility, ah, I don't know that we ever escape systems, you know in as much as I guess we say a system being a cultural discourse of guiding be narratives. Uhm, so yeah, it would be-- it would be rather than a gender binary, it would be, uhm, uhm, a system of multiplicity and flexibility where, ah, uhm, the proliferation of gender performances, identities, expressions, uhm, could, could be experienced and in which, on one hand we're never surprised like of course-- of course there is something different or that's an interest or that, that. So, we're never surprised and we have room for that, but we're also kind of always surprised in the sense of being curious and in wonder and, and appreciative of, of something new that, that's emerged. Uhm, and I think in moving from a binary system to one of flexibility and multiplicity, what would be eradicated then is gender based oppression. Uhm, because, the specifications and regulations wouldn't be there to be enforced so that people are policed and punished, ah, or rewarded based on how they ah, uhm - 

00:25:05
DAVID NYLUND You're right! 

00:25:05
JULIE TILSEN - describe to the specification. So, it wouldn't-- it wouldn't-- it wouldn't be oppressive that way. Uhm... 

00:25:15
DAVID NYLUND Ah, in, in terms of, ah, some ways that it might show up, ah, specifically is one might start with, ah, when, ah, one is pregnant and-- or "expecting" the, the first question would not be, is it a boy or girl? It might be a whole series of other questions that may be one can imagine right now. So that's, that's one thing. I think, uhm, that one would, uhm, ah, pick what they're interested in not based on gender, but what they're good at. Uhm, that gender would not limit. And it shows up in a lot of areas like sports, uhm, ah, ah, where I, I can't go into math as a woman, because women are not supposedly good at math. Their brain structure is, according to the scientist say that. So, there would be less limitations placed on what one is interested in. And it creates more, uhm, open in, ah, possibility. And I think the other one that comes to mind is that once, ah, preferences or desires would be, uhm, not based on gender or sex, but the qualities of the-- of the person. Lastly, uhm, and we've done some work on this, uhm, is that there wouldn't be a binary of what's a good and bad sex act. That all sex of consensual would be supported. Uhm, such as in open relationship, uhm, would not be seen as less than versus a committed monogamous relationship, which is seen as the healthier so. 

00:27:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah! Uhm, you wouldn't have to go searching for the right bathroom. That bathrooms would tell you what was in it. You know, there is sink, there is toilet. Ah, I like to see ones that had mirrors. Ah, so, that's kind of what I needed as I... 

00:27:15
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

00:27:15
JULIE TILSEN A sink, toilet and mirror and a door. 

00:27:20
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

00:27:20
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, but, we wouldn't have to go searching, ah, for bathrooms and so then there wouldn't be pe-- people suffering, uhm, and kids sitting in school all day, cooking up bladder infections and things like that. Uhm, so I think-- I think that that would be - 

00:27:35
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

00:27:35
JULIE TILSEN - a practical thing that we would see. Uhm, and I think our conversations with people, uhm, would necessarily become longer and richer and more complex, because we wouldn't have the shortcut of organizing around a category that we think we know what it means. If someone says, well I met this guy or someone says even, uhm, I, ah, went and worked with these young transmen, even, even things like that are starting to get sedimented. Uhm, and things had been on the outside start kind of getting socially constructed to have meanings that we think we know what they are, we would have to ask more about. Who was this person or who are you? How do you want me to know you? What's important for me to know about you? Rather than organizing around. Oh, I know what it means if you are a woman. Uhm - 

00:28:35
DAVID NYLUND Right, right. 

00:28:35
JULIE TILSEN And-- I mean, if, if you were to spend a day, uhm, having conversation where you took out any gendered language, so pronouns, first names that, uhm, we assign gender two, you know, uhm, familiar language, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa, anything that's gender and if you had a day without those conversations, it would be like either, uhm, gridlock you know in downtown Chicago during a blown-out or a multi-car crash on you know Interstate 94 during rush-hour through the Lowry Tunnel in Minneapolis . It would just-- it would be this that people wouldn't know they have to talk, they'd have to ask questions, they'd have to be descriptive in new ways. 

00:29:25
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

00:29:25
JULIE TILSEN And I think that would be a way. 

00:29:30
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

00:29:30
JULIE TILSEN That, that would be different. 

00:29:30
DAVID NYLUND May be-- I mean, there would be so many. One of that just came out for me is, ah, you know, parochial schools and other schools is of all boy school or in all girl school, or even a co-ed school that, that would, ah, dissipate, which should be a big crevasse in the educational system so. 

00:29:55
What would you like counselors/therapists to take away from this? 

00:30:05
JULIE TILSEN I think that's probably-- if you're watching this and you only had a couple of minutes start here, because it's a very important part. A few things come to my mind, uhm, one would be is although here Dave and I are talking about a lot of theoretical or philosophical and conceptual ideas that we see as important theoretical and conversational resources. I think we agreed that theory is only as good as it starts to elevate peoples lived experiences, that it helps to find ways to bring forward, articulate, advocate for and make room for the people we're working with. 

00:30:45
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

00:30:45
JULIE TILSEN The theory can't lead the show here. So that would be one and the second thing would be, uhm, as you're watching, uhm, the sessions that session Dave does with Gwen, and session I do with Tighearnan, and then the conversations we have in reflection afterwards with them is do not think about us and what we're doing good, bad or otherwise, but to think about, uhm, what, what are Tighearnan and Gwen, what can you learn from them? Not about them, but what are they here to teach you? Uhm, how, how can they invite you, uhm, into, may be unhinging some things to keep you, you stuck personally and professionally? 

00:31:30
DAVID NYLUND Uhm-uhm. 

00:31:30
JULIE TILSEN To position down as, uhm, that, that they lived experiences insider knowledges, uhm, are, are as valuable as anything we have to offer. 

00:31:45
DAVID NYLUND Ah, I, uhm, to add to that I would, uhm, invite them to notice their reactions to - 

00:31:50
JULIE TILSEN Hmm. Hmm. 

00:31:50
DAVID NYLUND - uhm, Gwen and Tighearnan and how it might upset some of their notions of what constitutes a man or a woman and - 

00:32:00
JULIE TILSEN Or queer transfers then. 

00:32:00
DAVID NYLUND - or queer. Exactly! 

00:32:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:32:05
DAVID NYLUND And how, uhm, our training as therapists, as clinicians is been mainly around assessment and evaluation, and that evaluation is not neutral, that evaluation is fed by some of exactly what we're talking about, these traditional normative discourses, they're gender binary and how it might be easy to move into spaces of evaluation and judgment, and even using, ah, medical discourses or the DSM to justify that. So, to notice some of their reactions, and then to find ways, uhm, to bring forth other meanings and other possibilities that could open up space, not only with their work with clients, but, but mainly their own notions of, of their own gender and sexually no limitations and expectations when it's placed on themselves. And in doing so, then one might find that the, the courage and heroism it takes for people to live outside the binary. Uhm, and, ah, Gwen and I think Tighearnan are, are examples of that. Uhm, in terms of putting themselves, ah, because they're out, uhm, in public including this tape, it, it puts some them at, at great risk. And this is, you know working with clients who have, uhm, attempted suicide or, or been murdered by transphobia, a person who has been murdered other hate crime. So, uhm, I think-- I think that is important. It also along with that could be easy to get into, well who is Gwen , is she transgender, is she gender queer, wanting to fix that person - 

00:33:50
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:33:50
DAVID NYLUND - to make sense of it. And what we find more useful is, why we even ask that question and what are the limitations of that question, what excluded out that question? Uhm... 

00:34:05
JULIE TILSEN I would be asking a question like who are you or what are you? 

00:34:05
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

00:34:05
JULIE TILSEN Even-- how does that make a difference? How-- what would you do with that? 

00:34:10
DAVID NYLUND Right! You, you'll notice in the tape that we don't ask those questions, but more we might ask questions of how, how the larger ideas about sex and gender police us, in ways that they've found ways to, uhm, to stand up to that policing so? 

00:34:30
[sil.] 

00:34:40
JULIE TILSEN Thanks for being to come and have this conversation today. Uhm, we just met out in the waiting space a little bit ago. We talked a real briefly about what some of your hopes would be for this conversation today, uhm, in terms of what you might want to talk about and I'm curious. If you have a sense of, uhm, sort of take away, what you would like to come from a conversation today? Assume we look back 45 minutes or now, from now, uhm, how might you be leaving the room differently than you've just come in? Does that make sense? 

00:35:15
TIGHEARNAN Hmm. Hmm. I think so. 

00:35:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:35:20
TIGHEARNAN I think just telling my story - 

00:35:20
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:35:20
TIGHEARNAN - ah, would be helpful. I mean, I must understand this for educational purposes and I would love to just share. 

00:35:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:35:30
TIGHEARNAN Because that's helpful for anybody. 

00:35:30
JULIE TILSEN Fantastic, cool! Uhm, I'm curious about this idea of sharing for educational purposes. Uhm, what would you hope people that have an opportunity or take the time to watch this would take away from this? How, how would you hope they might become educated? 

00:35:50
TIGHEARNAN Something I do when I was in other people's stories is try to find, uhm, what's similar between me and that person. And you know, using that as a similar hope for me, just knowing that somebody out there that's like me is successful and their idea of being successful, gives me hope. 

00:36:10
JULIE TILSEN Ah! So you found hope and perhaps it's sounds like inspiration, encouragement, possibilities, when you listen to other folk's stories and you've been able to kind of land on points of similarity or connection? 

00:36:25
TIGHEARNAN Hmm. Hmm. 

00:36:25
JULIE TILSEN Okay. So then your hope here is you might kind of what, what were was that film pay forward here? 

00:36:30
TIGHEARNAN Yeah, yeah, kind of! 

00:36:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah! Put through some of that dugout there ah? 

00:36:35
TIGHEARNAN Yeah, absolutely! 

00:36:35
JULIE TILSEN Okay, alright. So, for you, uhm, this conversation is an opportunity for you to perhaps, uhm, put some hopefulness and possibility up to the world for other folks, uhm, that may resonate with you in some way? You find some similarities? 

00:36:50
TIGHEARNAN Hmm. Hmm. 

00:36:50
JULIE TILSEN Okay! Are there particular aspects of, uhm, your story, your identity, you know, ah, how you're moving through the world right now that you want to highlight, is something that you think might, ah, put some open possibility on the world for folks? 

00:37:10
TIGHEARNAN Actually, yes! 

00:37:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. Yeah. Okay. 

00:37:10
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, I don't think people of color or people of minority background or - 

00:37:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:37:15
TIGHEARNAN - different ethnic backgrounds get to talk a lot about their lives or I feel like you know being trans in the LGBT community and being color tuned marginalize you in a very different way. 

00:37:30
JULIE TILSEN You're doubly marked? 

00:37:30
TIGHEARNAN Yes. 

00:37:30
JULIE TILSEN How would you say that? 

00:37:30
TIGHEARNAN Yeah! Well, I mean at the community at large I'm queer and that puts me in a smaller tear - 

00:37:40
JULIE TILSEN Hmm. Hmm. 

00:37:40
TIGHEARNAN - and then I'm trans, but that I'm also a person of color, so I'm - 

00:37:45
JULIE TILSEN Yeah! 

00:37:45
TIGHEARNAN - I think I'm triple-tiered. 

00:37:45
JULIE TILSEN Triple-tiered, yeah. Do you suppose that, uhm, you know I'm thinking as, as a white cisgendered, uhm, person here, uhm, other cis folks they're watching this perhaps white, ah, that occupy other places of dominance or privilege. Uhm, do you think it's impossible for them to find points of connection or similarity with someone like you or do you think that there may be some possibilities there as well? 

00:38:15
TIGHEARNAN Oh, absolutely I think - 

00:38:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:38:20
TIGHEARNAN - that you know on a human level, there is many things that we can connect with - 

00:38:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, okay. 

00:38:25
TIGHEARNAN - laughter, sex, food, plenty of things that are across the board. 

00:38:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah, okay, alright. And, uhm, when you talk about occupying these places, queer, trans, being a person like color, uhm, you know I'm wondering if, uhm, there-- do you have many places in your life where you get to bring all that at the same time or you to occupy all of that? Do you know what I mean? 

00:38:50
TIGHEARNAN I know exactly what you mean. 

00:38:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:38:50
TIGHEARNAN One day, I'm Asian . One day, I'm trans. 

00:38:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah! 

00:38:55
TIGHEARNAN Yeah! You know may be I haven't thought about enough, but there are spaces where I'm like, well I'm Asian today because somebody made tokenism joke. Uhm, I find that when I'm with my trans community. I could be-- I can encompass everything that is me. Like I feel more free in that way. 

00:39:15
JULIE TILSEN Hmm. 

00:39:15
TIGHEARNAN But, there is a lot of time, so I feel like I should just be that token whatever. 

00:39:20
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah! 

00:39:20
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

00:39:20
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, what are your ideas about what it is about your trans community that allows you to have the space to bring all yourselves there? 

00:39:30
TIGHEARNAN I just-- honestly, I feel like that the majority of them are the most open-minded people in very sense of the word. 

00:39:40
JULIE TILSEN Hmm. Hmm. 

00:39:40
TIGHEARNAN And I... 

00:39:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:39:40
TIGHEARNAN Yeah, let's finish that bad. 

00:39:45
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, I'm sorry. 

00:39:50
TIGHEARNAN It's okay. 

00:39:50
JULIE TILSEN Sorry. We'll figure each other out probably. 

00:39:50
TIGHEARNAN I'm sure. 

00:39:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:39:50
TIGHEARNAN We'll get rhythm. 

00:39:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, alright! So, uhm, you know what I'm wondering is, do you think that is there something you would that kind of openness, ah, is that something you would describe to all trans communities or is there something about the people that you've collected, and then I've collected you that has created that space of openness? And enclose in. 

00:40:15
TIGHEARNAN I never thought of. I'm sorry to interrupt. No, I, I never thought about that, but that's probably true. 

00:40:20
JULIE TILSEN Ah! 

00:40:20
TIGHEARNAN I have some very like stringent requirements were made, really close friendships. 

00:40:30
JULIE TILSEN Hmm. Hmm. 

00:40:30
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, one of them is probably acceptance and understanding and ability to communicate. 

00:40:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah, okay. Uhm, and when you talked here later about why I'll tell you a story, it is probably a story about kind of coming into those requirements, figuring them out and figuring that may be stepping into them, if they are okay to have? 

00:40:50
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

00:40:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah! Is that something that-- Is that something we should talk a little bit about or we kind of opened up to feel like we've started a few pages here and I'm wondering what - 

00:41:00
TIGHEARNAN Right. 

00:41:00
JULIE TILSEN - what you'd like to fill in for a while. 

00:41:00
TIGHEARNAN I'm focusing mainly on my transition. I'm sure there is a different avenue - 

00:41:05
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

00:41:05
TIGHEARNAN - that we could take. 

00:41:10
JULIE TILSEN Okay, okay, Okay. So, when you say transition, uhm, just to be clear, are you talking specifically around, transition around gender stuff? 

00:41:20
TIGHEARNAN Not necessarily. 

00:41:20
JULIE TILSEN Yeah! What are you talking about? 

00:41:20
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, of course it's the physical transition - 

00:41:25
JULIE TILSEN Hmm. Hmm. 

00:41:25
TIGHEARNAN - hormones binding... 

00:41:25
JULIE TILSEN Hmm. Hmm. 

00:41:25
TIGHEARNAN Physical things, but... 

00:41:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah! 

00:41:30
TIGHEARNAN Thinking back on the two and a half years, uhm, when I first began my transition what a different person that I was and talking to my friends and reflecting on that. I always find it really interesting to talk to my friends about, what was that I like, like two and a half years ago and it's so starkly different. 

00:41:50
JULIE TILSEN What's interesting and perhaps important or meaningful in stopping and taking inventory, taking stock, kind of that one that temper to mention the time line, how can that something you find yourself keeping coming back to? 

00:42:05
TIGHEARNAN I find that history to Disney a lot. 

00:42:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:42:05
TIGHEARNAN Not repeating mistakes. 

00:42:10
JULIE TILSEN Okay, yeah. And so it helps you not repeat mistakes? Telling some stories over again and hearing from other folks? 

00:42:15
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

00:42:20
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah, okay. And, and I'm also wondering, uhm, are there bits of history that in hearing, hearing them repeated, uhm, and may be hearing them repeated from other people's perspectives, uhm, other bits of history that you make sure you want to hang on to and bring forward with you as you continue on? 

00:42:35
TIGHEARNAN Absolutely, right back when we started with storytelling. 

00:42:40
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

00:42:40
TIGHEARNAN I think it's really important to keep rehearsing and - 

00:42:45
JULIE TILSEN Uh, huh. 

00:42:45
TIGHEARNAN - and what not. 

00:42:45
JULIE TILSEN Uh, huh, so in terms of the story of transition, uhm, you marked the beginning of a, about two and a half years ago. 

00:42:55
TIGHEARNAN Hmm. Hmm. 

00:42:55
JULIE TILSEN If, if we could time-travel back two and a half years ago, but carry with you what you have now, would you even look further back and may be see some, some seeds of that your transition occurring in, in some ideas or some hopes or, or some dreams or some conversations that predate two and a half years? 

00:43:15
TIGHEARNAN You're asking if I know what I know now, what I do things differently? 

00:43:20
JULIE TILSEN Something like that. Well, not necessarily what you do differently. Uhm, thanks, I'm gonna clarify that. I'm just you know, if you could travel back to this point in time two and a half years ago where you're saying that's, this is where I marked this beginning, but now with all those conversations you've had or people have gathered and kind of been there. The history keepers may be the dwellers of this story, right? You could go back and having all those stories and those versions of the stories available to you. Is there any way you'd even look further back than two and a half years and seeing all that, may be this guy different origin story that might be important, that kind of bringing forward with me from here on out. 

00:44:00
TIGHEARNAN That does happen. 

00:44:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, what... 

00:44:05
TIGHEARNAN I don't necessarily look so much at my passing that way though but... 

00:44:05
JULIE TILSEN Okay! What are your thoughts about that? 

00:44:10
TIGHEARNAN To clarify my thoughts about? 

00:44:15
JULIE TILSEN You said you don't-- you don't, thanks if I don't make sense, just let me know one way or other. Uhm, when you say that's not how you think about it, I'm wondering what your thoughts are, what your thinking is? How do you think about how perhaps, what do you with that history, uhm, that origin story of your transition? Because you've said it's-- tell me if I'm getting this wrong. It sounds like you said, having that history in that story is important. And, and your-- the retaliance of it, yeah - 

00:44:45
TIGHEARNAN Okay, I got it. 

00:44:50
JULIE TILSEN - somehow are you thinking about if it's not kind of how I asked if you're thinking about it? 

00:44:50
TIGHEARNAN It lets me know that I'm still growing and I'm still learning and that that's going to be constant. 

00:45:00
JULIE TILSEN Uh- huh. 

00:45:00
TIGHEARNAN Accepting changes and moving on and moving forward and not trying to hold on to the past so much, but celebrating the change in between. 

00:45:10
JULIE TILSEN Umm. Hmm. 

00:45:10
TIGHEARNAN It makes me feel good. 

00:45:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, okay! And, and celebrating the change and, and moving forward, growing. 

00:45:15
TIGHEARNAN Hmm-hmm. 

00:45:15
JULIE TILSEN Like you said, uhm, given the past, what kind of meaning or significance does knowing the past lend to the sense of growth and change? 

00:45:35
TIGHEARNAN Again I'm stuck in your question. 

00:45:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah! Well, I'm wondering would there be growth and change, uhm, I mean, it seems like it stands in contrast with something in the past. I'm wondering if there is a way, there is a relationship between the meaning you're making now of that growth and what was going on in the past? And that's-- it's slightly a nonsensical question we can just dump it. 

00:46:00
TIGHEARNAN I'm going to try. Uhm, I think a lot of the times I doubt myself, the voice in my head, that's really negative. 

00:46:10
JULIE TILSEN Hmm. Hmm. 

00:46:10
TIGHEARNAN That I'm not growing or that I'm not doing the right things, but when I look back and realize the decisions that I made that I feel like I have done the right thing. 

00:46:20
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:46:20
TIGHEARNAN And lets me know that I-- I'm still that good person or I'm still have the same amount of emotional effort behind things. 

00:46:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:46:25
TIGHEARNAN I'm still passionate about what I'm doing. So, it kind of reminds me that, yeah, I'm okay. 

00:46:35
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

00:46:35
TIGHEARNAN You don't get? 

00:46:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah! So, so, uhm, this voice in your head tries to talk to you out of these things that when you takes stock and you can look back to where you've been and the train you traveled and where you're headed. 

00:46:45
TIGHEARNAN Yes. 

00:46:45
JULIE TILSEN Then you can embrace the chance. 

00:46:50
TIGHEARNAN Yes. 

00:46:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:46:50
TIGHEARNAN Makes me feel good about myself and have faith in my abilities. 

00:46:55
JULIE TILSEN Fantastic, yeah, yeah. That, that's what I meant. 

00:46:55
TIGHEARNAN That's it. Yeah! 

00:46:55
JULIE TILSEN Kind of relationship between the significance of what's going on now and your hopes for the future? 

00:47:00
TIGHEARNAN Umm. Hmm. 

00:47:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, okay, cool. Well, thanks for struggle through that with me. 

00:47:05
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

00:47:05
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

00:47:05
TIGHEARNAN Got it. 

00:47:05
JULIE TILSEN Alright! So, uhm, so, this idea of transition part of it is about looking back and seeing where you've been and where you're headed, celebrating you said this growth and the change. Where are some other dimensions of, uhm, transition, this, this dimension of your story that you said you want to talk some about now? 

00:47:30
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, teaching other people. When I get a lot of-- when people find out that I'm tans is well, that must be really difficult or wow, that's a journey and they've-- the people with me that empathize a lot, they think about themselves and what it would be like to be in, I guess another gender. 

00:47:50
JULIE TILSEN Kind of like, well, I could never do that! 

00:47:50
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

00:47:55
JULIE TILSEN What do you think their intentions are when they said that? And what, what are the consequences of their intentions you're left with when someone says, wow, I could never do that? 

00:48:05
TIGHEARNAN It seems really simple for me like this is what I needed to do, what I had to deal with, you have a toothache, you go to the dentist like - 

00:48:10
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

00:48:10
TIGHEARNAN - first one then the other. I think what they're trying to say is that you know, I'm a very strong person or in some ways that they're jealous, ah, about - 

00:48:20
JULIE TILSEN Umm. Hmm. 

00:48:20
TIGHEARNAN - how they're running their lives, like, ah, I wish I were that brave. I get that a lot too. 

00:48:25
JULIE TILSEN Brave? 

00:48:25
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

00:48:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah! What do you think it is some people might think, uhm, is requiring a fair amount of bravery or courage that they see you're doing? What is that you are standing up to or having to take on from their perspective? 

00:48:40
TIGHEARNAN Socially speaking - 

00:48:45
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:48:45
TIGHEARNAN - what it's like to be ostracize and being clear. 

00:48:45
JULIE TILSEN Umm. Hmm. Umm. Hmm. 

00:48:50
TIGHEARNAN And their families, being disowned from their families that type of thing. 

00:48:50
JULIE TILSEN Umm. Hmm. 

00:48:55
TIGHEARNAN Taking your support system and basically being what I like to call lone wolf. 

00:49:00
JULIE TILSEN Lone Wolf? 

00:49:00
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

00:49:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah! And, ah, you know you mentioned the other different places you occupy, you highlighted a couple of times being a person of color, and a queer person of color, and, and I'm wondering if, uhm, do you get some of that from people that occupy your, your racial or ethnic community that there is something about, uhm, coming from that community in particular, coming out as queer person, is that, is that... 

00:49:30
TIGHEARNAN It's making me think of my family. 

00:49:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:49:30
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, Christmas is coming up and we get to go visit family and half of them don't know that I have transition, but when they see me it's like, pretty obvious but they just kind to glace over it. 

00:49:40
JULIE TILSEN Umm. Hmm. 

00:49:40
TIGHEARNAN And there is a lot of layers there too, uhm, I was adopted. 

00:49:45
JULIE TILSEN Umm. Hmm. 

00:49:45
TIGHEARNAN My mom adopted me because she wanted a girl. 

00:49:50
JULIE TILSEN Umm. Hmm. 

00:49:50
TIGHEARNAN And so, in her eyes, I have kind of crushed that dream by not doing what she wanted and to the stage, she still like you know, you don't have to be that way type of attitude. 

00:50:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:50:00
TIGHEARNAN And it's like well. I mean, it's like it's not really your choice, you would understand, but she is so stuck in her idea of adopting a daughter that she cannot really see her child for what I am. 

00:50:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah! How old are you when you came to the family? 

00:50:20
TIGHEARNAN Six months. 

00:50:20
JULIE TILSEN Six months and you're - 

00:50:20
TIGHEARNAN So... 

00:50:20
JULIE TILSEN - now? 

00:50:20
TIGHEARNAN Twenty-four. 

00:50:20
JULIE TILSEN Twenty-four, yeah. Okay. And, uhm, ah, it sounds like your mom was really passionate about being a mom to a daughter? 

00:50:30
TIGHEARNAN I have two older brothers and she didn't want to try anymore biologically. She is like I want to be sure that I have a daughter. And something that she constantly shares with me is loving the time that she spent with her mother , her mom was very close - 

00:50:45
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

00:50:45
TIGHEARNAN - because she lost her dad when she was young. 

00:50:50
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

00:50:50
TIGHEARNAN And so she took care of the family and her mom didn't speak any English and she basically raised her four or five brothers that she had and holds a lot of importance with the mother-daughter bond. 

00:51:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. 

00:51:00
TIGHEARNAN So, it was really difficult for me to tell her like sorry, you don't really have a daughter . 

00:51:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah! So, you recognize, uhm, you seem to-- you've tried to make some efforts to understand within your mom's, uhm, world and understanding of her experience of a mother-daughter relationship that that kind of loads, puts some meaning and real intentional effort she made to have a daughter. So she was-- she was able to reproduce. She was-- she was-- she was making babies? 

00:51:35
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

00:51:35
JULIE TILSEN Ah, but so real intentionally wanted a daughter that has this meaning for her. 

00:51:40
TIGHEARNAN Uhm. Hmm. 

00:51:40
JULIE TILSEN Would you say that, that, that's something she was passionate about? 

00:51:45
TIGHEARNAN Absolutely. 

00:51:45
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:51:45
TIGHEARNAN Absolutely! I think it's a cup of, ah, a large chunk of her life when I think about what my mom's live encompasses - 

00:51:55
JULIE TILSEN Hmm-hmm. 

00:51:55
TIGHEARNAN - hard work and family - 

00:51:55
JULIE TILSEN Hmm-hmm. 

00:51:55
TIGHEARNAN - are the two that really come to mind. 

00:52:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah! So, so you see her as being like passion about being a mom, ah, had been a mom to a daughter - 

00:52:05
TIGHEARNAN Hmm-hmm. 

00:52:05
JULIE TILSEN - working on behalf of her family, uhm, were there any particular, uhm, challenges that she faced doing that given her ethnic or racial location? 

00:52:15
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, I have to say that for a Chinese-American, she was pretty progressive. 

00:52:20
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

00:52:25
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, as a mother in certain ways - 

00:52:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:52:25
TIGHEARNAN - but very traditional in others. 

00:52:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. 

00:52:30
TIGHEARNAN Specifically, of education. 

00:52:30
JULIE TILSEN Hmm-hmm. 

00:52:30
TIGHEARNAN You know might be kind of a stereotype, but she really pushed education - 

00:52:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. 

00:52:35
TIGHEARNAN - like, ah, extracurricular activities and things like that, I just really wasn't interested in. 

00:52:40
JULIE TILSEN Now, you are getting? 

00:52:40
TIGHEARNAN Yeah, so I definitely - 

00:52:40
JULIE TILSEN Alright. 

00:52:40
TIGHEARNAN - was the black sheep. 

00:52:45
JULIE TILSEN Okay, yeah. You weren't fulfilling some of those ideas? 

00:52:45
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

00:52:45
JULIE TILSEN Okay. Uhm, so, so, you know, I'm struck by turning how you've cast yourself has being passionate and, uhm, you understand your mom as being passionate as well and, uhm, do, do you see yourself, uhm, perhaps owing some of your passion to her at all or would she recognize it? She had to hand like a (inaudible ) and you know, on you, this passion and having to do what you have to do? 

00:53:20
TIGHEARNAN I feel that I'm really good, ah, I don't know what I need to say. I want to say offspring cookie cutter, I'm really... 

00:53:30
JULIE TILSEN You're a good kid? 

00:53:30
TIGHEARNAN I'm, yeah. I, I really believe that I'm what my mom wanted is just that she can't see past labels and physicalities - 

00:53:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:53:40
TIGHEARNAN - to understand that and she gets it every once in a while when I do something that she'd go, oh, yeah, I would do that! That's good that you know that! 

00:53:50
JULIE TILSEN Uhm. Yeah. 

00:53:50
TIGHEARNAN But... 

00:53:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah! So, uhm, you are a good kid and you think that you've, uhm, in so many ways, would you say that if your mom could step outside of the gates of the gender system and, and some of those, those kind of clam down kind of things that she would be able to recognize or has she recognized that you are a good kid and that you really embody a lot of things that your family and as you wanted you to do? Would she be able to do that or she didn't feel that be down or clammed down or gender binary? 

00:54:25
TIGHEARNAN I think so. 

00:54:25
JULIE TILSEN She would, yeah. 

00:54:25
TIGHEARNAN There is a lot of things that she - 

00:54:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:54:30
TIGHEARNAN - could feel better about if she just looked past - 

00:54:30
JULIE TILSEN Hmm-hmm. 

00:54:35
TIGHEARNAN - the shallow and... 

00:54:35
JULIE TILSEN The shallow end. What do you mean? That's an interesting image. 

00:54:40
TIGHEARNAN Ever since I was younger it sounds like you guys are really, really my family. 

00:54:45
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. 

00:54:45
TIGHEARNAN You guys are really into like image. 

00:54:45
JULIE TILSEN Ah, kind of the front, front image of that! 

00:54:50
TIGHEARNAN Yeah, most definitely like how you dress. 

00:54:50
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

00:54:50
TIGHEARNAN Like how you talk, how you conduct yourself. 

00:54:55
JULIE TILSEN Hmm-hmm. 

00:54:55
TIGHEARNAN And I specifically remember her telling me at my dad's funeral, don't cry. Don't make a scene in front of your dad's friends. She doesn't remember this, of course she doesn't remember this, but - 

00:55:05
JULIE TILSEN Hmm. 

00:55:05
TIGHEARNAN - it was definitely embedded into my memory and it just - 

00:55:05
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

00:55:05
TIGHEARNAN - proved to me how important other people's opinions on me were - 

00:55:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:55:15
TIGHEARNAN - should be important to me. 

00:55:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah! And, uhm, when you say that you think that she wasn't so under the thumb of some of those systems of you know, normal and, and that kind of stuff that's right, that she would see how you really are, uhm, a member of the family that you embody many of the values and things that she would hope her children would. Uhm, in what ways does that speak to you Tighearnan of just the-- you pick what is this and the-- and the power of some of those social systems of regulation? 

00:55:55
TIGHEARNAN Say that one more time. 

00:56:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, you know, knowing that it sounds like in your heart of heart you know that your mom would see past, the stuff and see that you do embody what she would hope for her children to embody that you are that good kid. 

00:56:15
TIGHEARNAN Uh-huh. 

00:56:15
JULIE TILSEN But she can't, because of the systems, that blind her I just wonder how you would say what that's says about the power, the gender binary and some of these other normalizing things that it get your family, your mom , don't worry so much about what other folks think. 

00:56:35
TIGHEARNAN I think first of I would say that maybe she is not blind. 

00:56:40
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

00:56:40
TIGHEARNAN And I know she is smarter than she cares to-- cares to share. 

00:56:45
JULIE TILSEN Interesting. How do you mean? 

00:56:50
TIGHEARNAN Like I-- like I said that in the beginning she is pretty progressive for... 

00:56:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. 

00:56:55
TIGHEARNAN Chinese-American... 

00:56:55
JULIE TILSEN Like first generation? 

00:56:55
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, she was born here actually. 

00:56:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, okay. 

00:57:00
TIGHEARNAN But she didn't actually grew up speaking in English. 

00:57:00
JULIE TILSEN Hmm. 

00:57:00
TIGHEARNAN It was interesting she was born in 1939, if I get you any reference. 

00:57:05
JULIE TILSEN Hmm-hmm. 

00:57:05
TIGHEARNAN I see her circling the idea of openness and progressiveness and, uhm, tolerance towards things that are socially unacceptable. 

00:57:20
JULIE TILSEN Really. 

00:57:20
TIGHEARNAN Over the years it's become "Oh! gay people or this or that, " but the other day she is like prop A we were talking about prop A. 

00:57:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:57:30
TIGHEARNAN And she goes I don't-- I don't think we should have to govern anything, that's not our business and I said "What, what?" So I feel that she is circling those things, but I know that my family puts a lot of pressure on her to do her act in her certain way and take for instance when my dad passed away she wasn't dating anybody, but she is now an husband, but I feel like she has this need to talk bad about him, so she is not just respecting my dad's memory and I think she does in front my aunts and uncles to just to be like, "Oh well" you know "I still of Andy(ph), but - 

00:58:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:58:05
TIGHEARNAN - you know she needs a companion in that, that ache is I think when more deep then, the judgment of her family. 

00:58:15
JULIE TILSEN Okay. Yeah. You know, I'm wondering if in what ways as you're talking about seen your mom circle around and maybe come in to some new understandings, is there a way in which she is transitioning to and that in kind of being mindful of the history we take stock of some of those transitions or changes just like... 

00:58:45
TIGHEARNAN Absolutely. 

00:58:45
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, so we were to go forward to think it's possible there may be a time when she embraces her son Tighearnan . 

00:58:55
TIGHEARNAN I'm not sure. I, I hope. I think she has come a long way. I came out as lesbian when I was 15 and when I came out as trans she goes, "Can't you be a lesbian?" 

00:59:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. 

00:59:10
TIGHEARNAN It was like first one than the other. 

00:59:10
JULIE TILSEN Right. The lesser of the two evils say. 

00:59:15
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

00:59:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. 

00:59:15
TIGHEARNAN She really deport the letter I gave her, uhm, that's my mark of transition, but recently I say in the last couple of months, it's been-- I always love you, you're my child and she has always said that to me and after saying that after my transition it really got me to think about where she is transitioning as well like you are saying pointing out. 

00:59:35
JULIE TILSEN It does. Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. Was there a time in the past during these last two-and-half years where you would have been surprised to hear yourself say something like this that yeah, you know, my mom is circling around, she is transitioning, she is able to say now I love my child, maybe not my son right I mean I hear that distinction, but are you somewhat is there another marker of transition that you're able to sit here and say yeah I see my mom maybe starting to circle round? 

01:00:10
TIGHEARNAN Absolutely. 

01:00:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:00:10
TIGHEARNAN Absolutely. I never mind in life that she would say anything like that to me. 

01:00:10
JULIE TILSEN Really. 

01:00:15
TIGHEARNAN Like I, I don't agree with the transition, but I still love you, you are my child. 

01:00:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. Was that a way in which perhaps you conceded a lot of power to the gender binary and not enough passion to your mom? 

01:00:25
TIGHEARNAN Damn it yes. 

01:00:25
JULIE TILSEN Why damn it? 

01:00:25
TIGHEARNAN Yes, it's exhausting arguing about those things. 

01:00:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. So, so a little bit of hope that your mom's passion might be up to the task of exposing the bit of the binary, huh? 

01:00:40
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

01:00:40
JULIE TILSEN Wow! 

01:00:40
TIGHEARNAN I think so. 

01:00:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. Are you the only two in your family that are passionate in this way and can take the down large systems of social regulation? Or there are others among you? 

01:00:50
TIGHEARNAN In my family? 

01:00:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. These people that you have to look forward to Christmas with. 

01:01:00
TIGHEARNAN Yeah, I don't know. I don't know because they don't see pass through their own privilege in a lot of ways. I know... 

01:01:05
JULIE TILSEN What kinds of privilege are you thinking they have like class privilege? 

01:01:10
TIGHEARNAN Oh, yeah. 

01:01:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. 

01:01:10
TIGHEARNAN Economic privilege for one. 

01:01:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. Okay. 

01:01:15
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, we didn't actually sign-- I don't this kind of (inaudible ) by that, we did an exercised in one of my psych classes psycho minority... 

01:01:20
JULIE TILSEN What? 

01:01:20
TIGHEARNAN Psycho minority classes... 

01:01:25
JULIE TILSEN So okay. Oh you did an exercise in class? 

01:01:25
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

01:01:25
JULIE TILSEN Okay sorry. Go ahead. 

01:01:25
TIGHEARNAN That's okay. We were on a football field. 

01:01:30
JULIE TILSEN Actually I am old. I don't hear things right so go ahead. 

01:01:30
TIGHEARNAN It's okay. I can sign it too. 

01:01:35
JULIE TILSEN That will just... 

01:01:35
TIGHEARNAN Just kidding. Just kidding. What we did in class was, uhm, we all stood on a football field and we were asked questions like, "Did your parents go to college? Take a step forward." 

01:01:45
JULIE TILSEN Right, right, right yeah. 

01:01:45
TIGHEARNAN And the only reason why I knew to look behind me was because there was people in front of me, but I also noticed that not everybody took the initiative to look behind them even though there was people in front. 

01:02:00
JULIE TILSEN Oh! Kind of what people do when they come into some privilege they stop looking back. 

01:02:05
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

01:02:05
JULIE TILSEN Just what's ahead? 

01:02:05
TIGHEARNAN Right. 

01:02:05
JULIE TILSEN How do I get up there? 

01:02:05
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

01:02:05
JULIE TILSEN Tell to the folks behind. 

01:02:10
TIGHEARNAN I, I feel that some people do that, yeah. 

01:02:15
JULIE TILSEN Okay and what's, what's the connection then you're making with that in terms of this, this sense you've got that of your family doesn't kind of get that privilege and stuff like that? 

01:02:25
TIGHEARNAN I think part of is not being able to self-analyze maybe. 

01:02:30
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

01:02:30
TIGHEARNAN That that they kind of accept what they have around them because there is not so much this war going on about who they are? 

01:02:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. 

01:02:40
TIGHEARNAN And what they are? 

01:02:40
JULIE TILSEN Oh, so self analysis been reflective. Uhm, do you think folks who'd occupy marginalize basis tend, tend to engage in that lot more than folks that don't that, that sort of sign of privilege as you don't have to think about how you go through the world so much? Yeah. Okay and is that-- is that some of your transition has been doing lot of that? 

01:03:10
TIGHEARNAN Analyzing my privilege? 

01:03:10
JULIE TILSEN Well no. Think it about how you go through the world. 

01:03:15
TIGHEARNAN Right. 

01:03:15
JULIE TILSEN Not just privilege we are just being thoughtful reflex of. 

01:03:20
TIGHEARNAN I don't like that, that feeling of acceptance. It's how I'm accepting of my privilege or I'm not going to think about. 

01:03:30
JULIE TILSEN Okay, yeah. 

01:03:30
TIGHEARNAN I don't know. I just feel like it's lot of uncaring about others. 

01:03:35
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. Uh-huh, you know... 

01:03:35
TIGHEARNAN Maybe that's off topic, I don't know. 

01:03:35
JULIE TILSEN No, I don't think it is and what it really, uhm, I find myself struck by and curious about, that you talk about that Tighearnan is you know it's be a little rough on the edges, but it's like how are you, how are you able to stand in both those places, uhm, (inaudible ) does that well, both the places of recognizing some of the privilege you come from and that you continue to benefit from. Well also stepping into and occupying what you talked about multiplicity of places, queer trans being a person of color, uhm, that are pushed to the margins that put you at risk of physical, spiritual, abortion or violence that you're able to do that. What, what, what is that say about perhaps that circle of open inclusive people you've collected and then they have collected you what does that say about some of the values as your mom has wanted to inspire and you-- how, how have you emerge that someone is able to, to stand in your privilege and, and, and the places of marginalization? 

01:04:50
TIGHEARNAN How did I get where was that? 

01:04:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, what's inspired that? What's behind that? Who is behind that? 

01:05:00
TIGHEARNAN Questioning things. I like to question things what my parents would say is right or wrong. Even if I didn't feel right to me. Uhm, I would always wanted to think about it, analyze it and I really feel like as I get older and I almost hate to say this is that my mom was right, my mom was right. Uhm, a lot of her idioms that I grew up with are ringing very true and becoming more prolific in my life. 

01:05:35
JULIE TILSEN Have you told her that? 

01:05:35
TIGHEARNAN You know I'm taking too long to think I'm going to just say no. 

01:05:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. What do you think it might mean to her to hear that you carry you so much of what she said. So much of her voice, her values that-- is there a way that as a young man you are actually more, you are able to embrace and embody more of your mom than you were able to do as a woman. 

01:06:00
TIGHEARNAN Here is the tricky part. 

01:06:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:06:05
TIGHEARNAN Because another one of her idioms actions speak a lot of than words. 

01:06:05
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

01:06:05
TIGHEARNAN My interpretation of what she is saying to me and how I apply them to my life. She doesn't interpret the same way. I always said when you know, when we argue I need a translator- 

01:06:20
JULIE TILSEN Huh. 

01:06:20
TIGHEARNAN - because I mean we used to go to counseling together and it was, ah, like point teeth. 

01:06:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:06:30
TIGHEARNAN And to say she would say well, "I don't believe that you're doing what I want because you are doing this a specific way. Uhm, I don't think that you're living right because you are transitioning you are not -" 

01:06:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:06:40
TIGHEARNAN - that's in her eyes that's wrong. But what I'm doing is living life to the fullest of the best of my abilities and being who I'm and being a good citizen I guess that's something that she would also say. 

01:06:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah and those are the things that you would say that mom encourage you towards. 

01:07:00
TIGHEARNAN Yeah, absolutely. 

01:07:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. So, so she would see. Oh! here the stuff of it, the behaviors, the actions. Uhm, so again I ask you, you know, like have you told her what's propping up those behaviors. These actions you're taking, does she know what the values or the meaning to significance her presence in those, does she know of those things? 

01:07:20
TIGHEARNAN I don't think so. 

01:07:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. What might you expect could come of it and a kind of transition that two of you could make together if she had a access to that kind of information that kind of significance and meaning. You know what go-- what's propping up and informing that the actions you are taking up right now? 

01:07:45
TIGHEARNAN I would again need a translator. I have to convince her - 

01:07:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:07:50
TIGHEARNAN - that this is my version of what you are teaching me. 

01:07:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, so how do you understand when we talk about you know translator turn in you know, what are the languages you are speaking across or the, the discourses you're talking across with mom? Where is she occupying and where you occupying? 

01:08:10
TIGHEARNAN She has really traditional views of what's right and wrong, what's proper again like image, like how you should wear things flying out of the radar type of the attitude and I'm just as a loud as can be. 

01:08:25
JULIE TILSEN No. 

01:08:25
TIGHEARNAN No, I know. Whatever I get... 

01:08:30
JULIE TILSEN Shocked me. 

01:08:30
TIGHEARNAN Yeah, even if I'm not talking. 

01:08:30
JULIE TILSEN Okay, so you know I'm thinking back when we started talking in and, and you said something that's really inspired you, you found hope is when you listen to other folk stories and you find similarities and what you are hoping to give back yours that maybe someone, someone out there will hear some similarities they can land on here. And I'm wondering what your ideas are about how is it your mom and you are so locked in these, uhm, different places that maybe question is on how is it you are not finding the similarities. I'm wondering what similarities are there that maybe because of the two spots you're occupied, you're, you're missing the similarities? What's the third possible place you could occupy together or place you could visit together temporarily, so that those similarities might kind of be enough of something they grab on to, to stay in conversation together? 

01:09:30
TIGHEARNAN I've been thinking about that for years. 

01:09:30
JULIE TILSEN Alright so that isn't a new question. 

01:09:35
TIGHEARNAN No. 

01:09:35
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

01:09:35
TIGHEARNAN If I could find a space that - 

01:09:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:09:40
TIGHEARNAN - we could be... 

01:09:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. So if your mom were here and I could ask her something like that. Uhm, what you-- what would she say in terms of what, what are some similarities that perhaps, uhm, both of you have, uhm, shorts-- have been shortsighted about or somehow something's come between you and them so you are not able to bring them forward into your efforts to talk with each other rather than across each other. What would mom say? 

01:10:10
TIGHEARNAN That I just need to listen more. 

01:10:10
JULIE TILSEN She would like you to listen more! Okay, yeah. And would she say and you are listening more that she would also come into understanding your similarities just as you would come into understanding hers? 

01:10:25
TIGHEARNAN That's what she would physically say, but what she would really mean - 

01:10:30
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

01:10:30
TIGHEARNAN - and maybe this is just how I'm interpreting it - 

01:10:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:10:30
TIGHEARNAN - is that she would like me to be more-- she'd like me to do what she wants. 

01:10:40
JULIE TILSEN Which is be a girl. 

01:10:40
TIGHEARNAN Hmm-hmm. Be a girl. Go to college, focus on school, live at home. Things that aren't conducive to a happy living environment for me. 

01:10:50
JULIE TILSEN Hmm-hmm. Do you believe that your mom is so passionate about the idea being a mom to a daughter of having you be a girl that she would be willing to see you sacrifice your happiness? 

01:11:10
TIGHEARNAN Absolutely. 

01:11:15
JULIE TILSEN It would. Yeah. 

01:11:15
TIGHEARNAN I think because she herself had made a lot of sacrifices for her happiness - 

01:11:20
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

01:11:20
TIGHEARNAN - that she thinks everybody should do that. 

01:11:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:11:25
TIGHEARNAN Or that's the right way to be in its-- she is in so much pain because of it. 

01:11:30
JULIE TILSEN Okay. Is in what ways is, ah, having witnessed your mom's pain also been something that's inspired you to do it makes you happy? 

01:11:40
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. That's very true. I don't think I have ever thought about that, but yeah. 

01:11:45
JULIE TILSEN How, how is that something that's inspired you to, to do what makes you happy? 

01:11:50
TIGHEARNAN Because she is 73 years old and she is so unhappy. She lives in the past a lot maybe that's why I don't like to think about my past or carry it with me so hard or so heavy that she constantly says stories or recite stories when she was younger and how hard she worked in you know, what do I have to show for it now. My husband is dead and I can't spent time with him and you know, what do I have to look forward, but to take care of these material things that we-- that they'd agreed on, like before he passed away. 

01:12:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. So you know I'm wondering Tighearnan, you see your mom has been really unhappy having sacrificed many things that caused her to be unhappy, uhm, yet she did the sacrifices like for you and your brothers and okay, so right yeah. Uhm, in, in what ways would you say you maybe dedicating your efforts at living your life toward happiness, uhm, in reflection analysis, uhm, exposing the gender binary and other systems regulation? How might your life be a dedication to her sacrifice, perhaps coming other time and from a place where she may not have had that option to live in that kind of resistance? 

01:13:20
TIGHEARNAN Very true. She is I feel like by telling my stories and breaking down those glass ceilings, uhm, a lots of people to be more free and something that she wasn't - 

01:13:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:13:40
TIGHEARNAN - got it. 

01:13:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:13:40
TIGHEARNAN That's it. 

01:13:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. You use this word free and that for me connects because what I've been thinking about and what was behind that question, was this idea of liberation and would I be curious about then Tighearnan. Can you still find value and meaning and purpose in working toward these libertarians, challenge in the gender binary, even if your mom may not come to that shared meaning with you that your intentions are behind that is in what ways is that still give it some meaning towards honoring, honoring her sacrifice? Even if she, she keeps on saying even she doesn't - 

01:14:20
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

01:14:25
JULIE TILSEN - share that meaning with you, I wonder how is that so a dedication or honoring of her sacrifice? 

01:14:30
TIGHEARNAN Both of my parents have always told me that they wanted a better life for their children and I might not have children now, but there is children out there that are suffering now. 

01:14:45
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

01:14:45
TIGHEARNAN There is other people that are out there that need that help and need that, that liberation that you're talking about - 

01:14:50
JULIE TILSEN Freedom that's how you said it? 

01:14:50
TIGHEARNAN Right. 

01:14:50
JULIE TILSEN We can use your words. 

01:14:55
TIGHEARNAN My dad was very generous and hopefully I have also embodied that in sacrificing, ah, my privacy and myself or whatever it is I need to do to perpetuate that idea that you don't need to be stuck in these stringent roles and... 

01:15:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:15:15
TIGHEARNAN Like a, like a cage almost. 

01:15:15
JULIE TILSEN It's a cage. 

01:15:15
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

01:15:20
JULIE TILSEN What kind of cage is? How, how would you describe the cage what that-- you are talking about cages of like normativity, gender okay. 

01:15:25
TIGHEARNAN Well, socially constructed cages, ah - 

01:15:30
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

01:15:30
TIGHEARNAN - that the media and other people perpetuate - 

01:15:30
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

01:15:35
TIGHEARNAN - things I that if I could live happy and confident that I'm living right - 

01:15:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. 

01:15:40
TIGHEARNAN - for me and If other people see that - 

01:15:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:15:45
TIGHEARNAN - they go, I could be happy. I could be confident doing, doing me, being me. 

01:15:50
JULIE TILSEN Do you think that might be a Christmas gift you have to offer your family this year. 

01:15:55
TIGHEARNAN I think so. 

01:15:55
JULIE TILSEN How would you hope they may receive that? 

01:16:05
TIGHEARNAN Disgrace and humility. 

01:16:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. 

01:16:05
TIGHEARNAN But I fear that they will, uhm, get really awkward with me. 

01:16:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, you fear it or you just anticipate it? 

01:16:20
TIGHEARNAN Both. 

01:16:20
JULIE TILSEN Both, yeah, okay. 

01:16:25
TIGHEARNAN I was talking with a friend last night about how I'm having really come out to all of my family - 

01:16:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. 

01:16:30
TIGHEARNAN - and not being trans and he said you know, it's better to tell them and put the ball in their court to be the asshole and expect that they're just going to brush you off, I was like, oh, yeah I have been little a bit of cowardess(ph) about this. Because I'm scared. 

01:16:45
JULIE TILSEN Cowardess (ph) you, you, you... 

01:16:50
TIGHEARNAN I feel like I have been, uhm, they getting I mean for two and half years not telling any of my family. Some of them the younger cousins that are in don't have such stringent roles I suppose. 

01:17:00
JULIE TILSEN You know I'm wondering what your thoughts are turned in about, uhm, how you decide around those ideas, uhm, about coming out or perhaps if there is any value and thinking about rather than coming out and what it sounds like kind of a perhaps hostile and inviting world. How you decide who and when you invite in to your world, so that rather than being an unwelcome guest and that one that you come out to you can be this gracious host in your world. 

01:17:40
TIGHEARNAN It's never really a question of whether I'm going to do it or not? Whether I'm going to come out or not - 

01:17:45
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:17:45
TIGHEARNAN - it's more about when and when am I comfortable. 

01:17:45
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, so I'm wondering how do you make those decisions and, and you know, it's ideal that you've been a coward, uhm, whose standards of courage or coward is, uhm, what criteria are you being measured up against, uhm, and who stands to benefit if your cast as a coward in a system that, uhm, creates, ah, non- laboratory unfree spaces. I'm just wondering about your readiness, ah, to go-- to go there to take on cowardess(ph) rather than perhaps looking at you know what's all this going on about us. 

01:18:35
TIGHEARNAN Let's go back a few questions about being ready and how I make my decision, uhm, knowing that everything with the, with the idea that if I'm out and proud and visible and confident about myself that, that gives other people hope and understanding that, oh this, this person is completely normal or normative or unhappy living the way they live, it must be okay. 

01:19:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:19:05
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, knowing that - 

01:19:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, I can get that. 

01:19:10
TIGHEARNAN - my actions have a ripple effect that that pebble into the pond makes me drive harder to do more things like this. 

01:19:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, so let me ask something because I'm, I'm curious about this as sort of teaching point and you've talked about this idea of being a teacher a couple of times. Uhm, how do you make sure when you talk about the significance and the importance for you to embrace out proud, visible? How do you make sure that someone that for whatever reasons can't do that right now doesn't cast themselves as a coward and unwilling and a closet case and not there for the cause, because I don't know that being out is always an equal opportunity endeavor. 

01:20:00
TIGHEARNAN Right. 

01:20:00
JULIE TILSEN People occupy different spaces, uhm, they may be physically, economically relationally at greater risk at different times. So I'm wondering do you know what I'm saying, how do we make sure we don't create another binary that out and visible it's good close it and invisible and the down low is bad. You know in recognition that people got different stuff going how-- what's your teachable taught about that? 

01:20:30
TIGHEARNAN For the most part I try to preface things with these are what's good for me. This is what feels good for me - 

01:20:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:20:40
TIGHEARNAN - and everybody has their own process and trying to remain people, uhm, if they ask their advice if or interested in like a regular conversation is to say at your own pace. 

01:20:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. 

01:20:50
TIGHEARNAN Do what feels good as long as you are not hurting yourself or others. 

01:20:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah, and, uhm... 

01:20:55
TIGHEARNAN But that's a good point to think about... 

01:20:55
JULIE TILSEN Is that make sounds? 

01:20:55
TIGHEARNAN And how to teach better with that thought. 

01:21:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, because I'm wondering to suppose that again depending on mere the different personal, familial, cultural issues people experience to beat down the binary and other regulating systems, racism, ah, classism experience and differently in their greater risk at different time around being out or whatever, right? 

01:21:25
TIGHEARNAN Right. 

01:21:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, okay. Yeah, uhm, was there a time when perhaps it was a greater risk for you than it is now? 

01:21:35
TIGHEARNAN I don't know, I don't know that. I've always had, uhm, when people saying you know, my family disown me that type of thing. 

01:21:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:21:40
TIGHEARNAN Like I've always in the back of my mind and my deepest darkest part of my heart knew that my mom will never do that to me. 

01:21:50
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

01:21:50
TIGHEARNAN And if she did I would prepare for that, but I, I never felt that part of me snap. I always felt that that, that was always gonna be there. 

01:22:00
JULIE TILSEN Have you told her that? 

01:22:00
TIGHEARNAN No. 

01:22:05
JULIE TILSEN Well, I'm just curious again about I'm just I don't know, I mean this is might stop, but I'm like kinda mining they are panning for these I'm gonna hung up from what you said first listen for similarities I'm worrying if there is sort of a somewhere or place she could land with you, you know that, uhm, you've always have this faith and confidence and her love for you, somehow that, that her love. Her passion for being a parent is transcended. 

01:22:30
TIGHEARNAN But I never again I go back to action speak louder than the words and I can't prove these things to her without - 

01:22:40
JULIE TILSEN No. 

01:22:40
TIGHEARNAN - doing things under her standards. 

01:22:45
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:22:45
JULIE TILSEN And they don't mean the same thing to me and I would rather keep the meaning then go through with an empty action. 

01:22:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, okay. 

01:22:50
TIGHEARNAN I think that on me more to her in the end. 

01:22:55
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh, so is there are way in which you pace in yourself with some of these things when you say they'll be more to her in the end? 

01:23:05
TIGHEARNAN Yeah, I think so. 

01:23:05
JULIE TILSEN You have a plan? 

01:23:10
TIGHEARNAN To establish, uhm, my goals as being valuable to her. I don't know how I'm gonna do that, but I'm gonna try. 

01:23:20
JULIE TILSEN In what ways do you think your mom had achieved her goals of being the kind of mom she wants to be having inspired this confidence in her mother's love. You know that you are so confident of her love and that you're working so hard there is something you think she should be proud of. 

01:23:45
TIGHEARNAN Absolutely. 

01:23:45
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:23:45
TIGHEARNAN I think so-- I think she would if she could, she passed her standards. 

01:23:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. And they all her standards or do you, what's informing her standards you know from you talked about social construction, what are some of the constructions some of the systems that her standards are in relationship to that that are informing her standards. 

01:24:05
TIGHEARNAN I don't really know what to call it just economically I mean she is always pushing to be you make, you need to make a lot of money that all the others. 

01:24:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah, so there is the standards of consumerism and, and, uhm, ah, middle class standards of keeping up at the chances(ph) or whatever and those sorts of things. 

01:24:25
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

01:24:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, I mean those are constructions too I mean we are not born with those knowledge or those ideas that we have to live them out, you know, okay. So, you know, we've just, we've, we've got a few minutes before we are supposed to wrap up or we, I was, uhm, uhm, wondering if we paused here then and kind of thought back with the last 50 minutes are so we've been talking. Uhm, what are some things that may be stand out for you or maybe you want to think a little bit more about, uhm, that were interesting for you that may be surprised you something new, anything in particular that emerged from my conversation. 

01:25:05
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, a couple of things, basically, uhm, working harder on finding that similarity with my mom and been able to communicate what I'm doing to her as valuable. 

01:25:25
JULIE TILSEN Because that would be on your terms meaning, what I'm getting from you as you know, meaning and intentionality is super important for you and somehow kind of ironically you've been trying to do on her terms that actions I wonder what it would like to invite her over there to, to understand that so that it is something that stuck out for you, okay. And, uhm, is there any thing that I didn't ask about or that you wish we would have got into that, that we did enter I missed somehow. 

01:26:00
TIGHEARNAN It might need a few more minutes to think about that. 

01:26:05
JULIE TILSEN No worries. 

01:26:05
TIGHEARNAN No. 

01:26:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, and given that, uhm, your stated, uhm, purpose or hopes for this conversation was that, uhm, there may be some you put some hope out there in the world that this might be a, a, a teaching opportunity something else for other folks to grab on to similarities with, uhm, now having had that conversation anything in particular the stuff of this conversation that you for sure would hope maybe someone would consider that you would want them to take from the conversation that was had. 

01:26:45
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, anything explicit and implicit, I know there are, there are things that I'm saying and doing that are giving off different vibes and what I might be saying, or what am I physically be saying. 

01:27:00
JULIE TILSEN How do you mean? 

01:27:00
TIGHEARNAN I feel like, uhm, no matter how open minded I'm there is still a room for me to expand and, uhm, understand like what you are saying about, uhm, being out and proud and then not wanting other people to feel like they need to be out and if they are not there, there you know. 

01:27:20
JULIE TILSEN Right, is that part your dad's generosity. 

01:27:20
TIGHEARNAN What do you mean? 

01:27:25
JULIE TILSEN You, you may right, you said your dad was really a generous guy and I and the I-- this capacity and willingness you have to think about how you effect others, it strikes me super generous and, and, and humble. And I'm just wondering is that sort your dad's mark. 

01:27:50
TIGHEARNAN I think so. 

01:27:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:27:50
TIGHEARNAN He was always, uhm, thinking of others when he was a civil engineer for the state but he had a lot of different ventures and he really wanted to take care of his family and the people that he did reach out to, he wanted to take care of, uhm, like he had a duplex or what not and even trying to rent to families who really needed a place to live or who really needed, uhm, help and then I remember going to Cusco or (inaudible ) whatever with him and buying like a stock of food that he would give to them like as I don't know a housewarming present... 

01:28:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah, for his tenants. 

01:28:30
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

01:28:35
JULIE TILSEN Wow! Ha. 

01:28:35
TIGHEARNAN I find myself doing that I actually have this, ah, girl that I'm working with, uhm, you know as kids and she is going through turbulent relationship and went on, she is you know barely making and taking care of her brother, her two brothers and her sister and so, uhm, I say we that I kind of have the idea together and get go to Cusco - 

01:29:00
JULIE TILSEN And do that. 

01:29:00
TIGHEARNAN - and get a whole bunch food for her - 

01:29:00
JULIE TILSEN Wow! 

01:29:00
TIGHEARNAN - for the month. 

01:29:05
JULIE TILSEN So you really are your mom and dad's kid. 

01:29:05
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

01:29:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:29:05
TIGHEARNAN Funny how that works 

01:29:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, alright. It's okay to stop here? 

01:29:10
TIGHEARNAN Yeah, sure. 

01:29:10
JULIE TILSEN Okay, thank you. 

01:29:15
TIGHEARNAN Yeah, absolutely. 

01:29:20
DAVID NYLUND Okay, so, uhm, I had the, ah, privilege of you know, listening on the conversation and I took some notes then I'm gonna to share what said out to me and may be post some questions, ah, about what Julie's intentions were about some other questions and what stood out, ah, anything that sparked your curiosity from my comments. So, I'll, I'll share a few things and then I'll turn back to you and see what stuck what you-- what you wanted to comment on so. The first thing that, uhm, stood out to me was you are talking about your, your dad's generosity and, uhm, I got a sense I fell his presence in the room and I can see how it's been passed on to you, the generosity of doing this, uhm, and having to, uhm, ah, you know, share some of your story including the interpersonal color with, uhm, a, a white cisgender person. Uhm, I don't think that can be, uhm, under appreciated you know. And then I also got a sense of, uhm, your mom's presence too. So the first question I had is, uhm, like what, what would have been like if your mom were present in this conversation which she have come us to a new realizations about how proud she is of you as she is trying to circ-- you know, circle around some of you know, coming to, ah, more of a place of, uhm, the acceptance and tolerance she has done it with like prop A and she is moving forward and Julie asked a question about where she might be in the future, so that's the one thing. The second thing was I was struck with how, uhm, you know, the lack of acceptance with certain parts of your family is to honor what's that like to be other. And I, I noticed that Julie was inviting you the conversation I want to also notice, uhm, parts of your family that you can move close to you and as part of this journey without surrendering yourself. So she asked several times about, uhm, like have you told your mom that, have you told your mom that, so I was thinking about what you might tell your mom from this conversation with anything so that's one thing and I'm also interested in what Julie's intention was in that. And then the other thing that set out to me was, ah, turning you or talking about, uhm, you know, adding to your courage and coming out to more people and Julie invited you to pause and you know, may be coming out it's not an amount of equal opportunity endeavor and it got you to rethink some ideas around coming out, so that's, that's what showed out to me so. So, so maybe Julie start about what, what were some of your attentions behind the questions regarding mom and then also the coming out. 

01:32:25
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, the questions regarding pausing and asking Tighernan if the meanings and the intentions and the significance of what he was doing if he had talked to his mom about that. 

01:32:40
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, yeah. 

01:32:40
JULIE TILSEN Well I, I for me part of what I was thinking about and what I was struck by is points of similarity that I was, uhm, hearing or experiencing between Tighearnan and his mom in terms of their passion, their integrity, uhm, around living into their values - 

01:33:05
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

01:33:05
JULIE TILSEN - and, uhm, I think lots of times culturally we, ah, go we are invited or forced to just look room narrowly, narrowly at what we do and Tighearnan had said you know, mom , mom is about action speak louder than words. Yet, uhm, she is also a women of passion - 

01:33:30
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

01:33:30
JULIE TILSEN - and, uhm, that's how she intentionally choose a daughter, uhm, that's how she gave a lot of sacrifice for her family. So when we are culturally we're, we're, we're, we're looking at the surface. You know we're looking at behaviors and it's just show me the money kind of stuff. We don't take the time to linger around and respond into meaning and what things mean to someone and so it just occurred to me that perhaps some of those points of connection with similarity might emerge or at least become a possibility if, uhm, Tighearnan's mom had an opportunity to hear his passion and intentions and the values. You know, how he had taken in and it was embodying all that stuff that she had hoped he would. 

01:34:25
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

01:34:25
JULIE TILSEN And that this was his way of manifesting it through his actions. 

01:34:30
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

01:34:30
JULIE TILSEN So that the point of connection or similarity was in the meaning purpose and intentions although they have two very different ways perhaps showing up in the world - 

01:34:40
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

01:34:40
JULIE TILSEN - and enacting them. And so I think that, that's kind of where I am coming from with that and then also to, uhm, perhaps locate those disconnects or the, the wedges that are coming between them hopefully locate them in a broader understanding it's not just about a power struggle or like you know talking different languages, uhm, like the image Tighearnan use, uhm, you know, I need a translator. That it's not just a problem located in them but that there's, there is we are not encouraged culturally to linger whether respond into meanings and values - 

01:35:20
DAVID NYLUND Uhm, right, right. 

01:35:25
JULIE TILSEN - and those sorts of things so but it is situated with an cultural context that doesn't afford us that luxury of doing that. 

01:35:30
DAVID NYLUND Right, it makes sense, and any thoughts about that? 

01:35:35
TIGHEARNAN I agree... 

01:35:35
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. Uh-huh, yeah, when, when Julie asked you have you talked your mom about that. You responded with you know where there seems to be some-- something turning inside in your head about that. 

01:35:50
TIGHEARNAN Because I never did think about, uhm, the way that you are describing how to respond to her like, what you just said about, uhm, showing her that I do get the values that you're teaching me, but this is how I manifesting in my own life. It never occurred to me to make that connection for her and you know well, you want me to do something this way, but I'm just with the different. 

01:36:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, and I think that's where culturally our idea of being engaged with people is informed by this idea of you know argumentation, proving someone right, having to come to a conclusion which often then as a win loose. But for me that's more about keeping the conversation going, stay in connected, we abandon the idea that we have to come to an agreement or even consensus, but it's about understanding. 

01:36:55
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

01:36:55
JULIE TILSEN And that, that is a culturally, uhm, that, that's an active resistance to our cultural ideas around conversation. I think, it's, it's, it's clear in the sense of resisting that idea of it's this or it's that. It's you are right, I'm wrong, uhm, having to finish something because it's always about stay in, move in - 

01:37:20
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

01:37:20
JULIE TILSEN - and staying in dialogue or conversation and so I think in that way it's an active resistance against this cultural, uhm, mandates around finality - 

01:37:30
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

01:37:30
JULIE TILSEN - finality and engagement. 

01:37:35
DAVID NYLUND Right, and what one of the things that really impresses me about Tighearnan is as you are engaged in the conversation, uhm, it really sparked his curiosity. I noticed his generosity and at the same time he is not surrendering who he is. 

01:37:55
JULIE TILSEN Exactly. 

01:37:55
DAVID NYLUND It's kind of a both end you know he is, he is clear as to who he is and what direction he is moving, how he is inspiring others and yet he still willing to hang in there with his mom and his family. To give them a Christmas gift you asked that question that was - 

01:38:10
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

01:38:10
DAVID NYLUND - a resonance there so, the other you want to spend a little bit more about the coming out issue that, that was really kind of how, how you invite that dialogue in a respectful way kinda tease those new assets and complexities out. 

01:38:25
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, in terms of not being committed again to sort of this idea of coming out and that, that's an endpoint - 

01:38:35
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

01:38:35
JULIE TILSEN - and that's, that's a mark of doing it right or something. 

01:38:35
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

01:38:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, uhm, again for me there is several things and I think one of the things that Tighearnan and I talked about it that seemed to make sense for him and that I was also perhaps I'm going to borrow on a leverages you know I certainly we'd talked prior in the conversation. You know, Tighearnan has got an analysis of privilege and he you know, I think, I had already talked about he is being willing to occupy, both his favorite places or privilege and his places of marginalization, a lot of people aren't always able to do that, uhm, and so I think there is a way in which, uhm, again we create binaries around you're out or you're not. I mean we have this whole of discourse, ah, a very, how normative discourse around, uhm, being now as an endpoint and that's what you're supposed to do and it's, it's like endpoint of development. Uhm, and then you've come into it, ah, yet I think there is a whole lots of reasons why many people can't come out or isn't safe to come out, ah, is and may not be safe and real physical life and death ways and it may not be relationally safe I think in many cultural locations it's not safe and I think it's often not very homonormative white you know, uhm, western, north American kind of idea to come out you know, because we often will abandon many connections if we don't get to assert our, our individual self with so many other cultures organized around community and kinship in ways in which you don't exist, if you don't exist in relationship with your people. 

01:40:15
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

01:40:20
JULIE TILSEN And so, uhm, I was interested in how given he, he embraces a responsibility as a teacher, uhm, how he might convey a message about this importance of coming out being visible and being proud. Well also recognizing that for some people it may not be an option and may not be an option now. May not be an option in certain arenas of their life. 

01:40:50
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

01:40:50
JULIE TILSEN So how can we talk about that importance of visibility, because we live in a political material reality where, we do need a voice of the table when things like propade(ph) are happening and things like that yet how do we do that so that were not reproducing a kind of oppression by somehow what's the opposite of coming out while you are on the down over, you are in the closet, the opposite or pride or shame. So that we are not shaming people if they are not out. 

01:41:20
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

01:41:20
JULIE TILSEN So, so that's, that's a lot for a word that question to kind of problem with ties what we've sort of taken for granted now, and the queer community and among straight allies that you're supposed to come out, but to say let's, let's slow this down and think about this little more complexity, uhm, and also to recognize that to, to me the whole idea of coming out and you know, if you don't you, you know you are not on. I mean there is all these ideas of discourse around honesty and that anticity and to me what's dishonest is we live in a culture that pleases people's desires and pleases peoples gender performances and preferences, uhm, that has regulations and specifications that are enforced by the gender binary, uhm, and to me that's dishonest to have a system like that, because it's not a system that allows for all the ways people show up in the world and when we locate the dishonesty and someone, uhm, because they are not out and not been authentic or real that is the true, why. 

01:42:30
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

01:42:30
JULIE TILSEN To, to, to, to privatize the burden and it's a privatization of, ah, a social problem. Uhm, you know it puts it on people and individual people rather than saying the problem is, this is the social problem, uhm, of injustice. 

01:42:50
DAVID NYLUND Right, right because I think, I think therapist can make that mistake like if you - 

01:42:55
JULIE TILSEN Absolutely. 

01:42:55
DAVID NYLUND - if you don't come out then you're, you're suffering from low self-esteem, sort of these individualistic kinds of... 

01:43:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:43:00
DAVID NYLUND - when, when you are having that conversation I saw sort of some light bulbs, pop up fuels you want to speak to (inaudible ) come into way with something new from the conversation. 

01:43:11
TIGHEARNAN That's, that's someone who loves to learn, uhm, new ideas and you're thinking it what you are saying actually makes me more comfortable that relieves lot of like pressure that I have had or, or thought about when like I need to be out and need to be this. And you know I'm not out at work because it's dangerous for me, but I'm out everywhere else and I'm doing panels and I'm doing things like just-- where you know that seems to possibly connecting this and but knowing that there is no end result that a couple of things clicked for me, uhm, like, ah, a break up that I had where there wasn't any closure and I'm really uncomfortable with that and finding out that you know, I'm need to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. 

01:43:50
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

01:43:50
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, so not feeling when you keep pointed out that, that there is system of you know, ah, finality and, and things that we need to have those things makes me more comfortable that there isn't bad, so it makes sense. 

01:44:05
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

01:44:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. Well, I would wonder if it, you know as I've come to know you and you know the last hour, how that fits your project of freedom, your, your freedom fight, your laboratory project, you know, that you can be free from this idea of having to be finished or have finality or closure or resolution or consensus that maybe not, but how you know, was tried to stay connected, tried to keep going, keep the conversation going, literally and metaphorically, yeah. 

01:44:35
TIGHEARNAN I think that's a great tool for me to use as a teacher, uhm - 

01:44:40
JULIE TILSEN Hmm. 

01:44:40
TIGHEARNAN - is that there is no one way to be and I have been saying that for a long time, but actually having that like it's okay to have anxiety of this there, may be, there is no answer and be comfortable with that and keep reaching that - 

01:44:50
JULIE TILSEN Hmm. 

01:44:50
TIGHEARNAN - I think it's more valuable tool than just now my idea of being out and being comfortable and being yourself I think it has a, uhm, it resonates deeper than just on the surface of being out... 

01:45:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:45:05
DAVID NYLUND Uhm-hmm. 

01:45:05
TIGHEARNAN Is that clear? 

01:45:10
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, yeah. I think that, uhm, because you're becoming more and more visible, there's, you'd been on panels, your teacher, uhm, the inspiration the generosity you are giving to others and it can also feel like a burden, uhm, and so kind of negotiating as to where you can share your story, but not, you don't represent all transgender people, all people or color. 

01:45:35
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

01:45:35
DAVID NYLUND And there is many different ways of expressing your gender and sex identity coming out is just one of them, you know, and so I sense that, that, that some of their pressure was le-- lessened by, by the conversation, so... 

01:45:50
TIGHEARNAN It seems more evolved to me and had all the panels that I have seen I think, the idea that makes me more, more-- most comfortable as when people are being authentic and I get kinda tell that with the way that they are speaking about, you know, I saw this one panel where, uhm, there is one gentleman who in his 40s and the rest were like, you know like kids in the 20s - 

01:46:15
DAVID NYLUND Ah-huh. 

01:46:15
TIGHEARNAN - and the kids were rehearsing these same kind of ideas, uhm, about being out, being proud. The other, ah, gentleman was, I feel more authentic, uhm - 

01:46:25
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

01:46:25
TIGHEARNAN - that's very interesting to me. 

01:46:30
DAVID NYLUND Right. Uhm, I guess that the last, ah, of the thing that, uhm, stood out to me was, uhm, how much that, ah, Julie appreciated know you know, your, uhm, the conversation and how you might have impacted Julie , you know in terms of having the experience of interviewing what she is has taken away from it, you know because, you know may be you're taking some things away but or having, have you considered that Julie was taking the way things to might be helpful in her thinking, her practice her way of being in the world so. 

01:47:10
JULIE TILSEN Is that a question for either one of us? 

01:47:15
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, yeah, had you considered that, that may be, she was also impacted by, yeah. Well, she will say can I take, can I take him away with me? There is a reason for that. 

01:47:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:47:25
DAVID NYLUND So... 

01:47:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:47:25
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. Why, why did you want to take Tighearnan home? 

01:47:30
JULIE TILSEN Oh! Uhm, uhm, I, I feel like, uhm, I'd been schooled in a lesson of, uhm, very generous humility, uhm, and capacity for self-reflection, uhm, you know to, to look at, you know if, if I look at myself being privileged as being a white skinned person and here you are as a racial minority, if I look at myself has been privileged as you know middle-aged professional. I mean, that, that always a little complicated youth you know, valuing youth but in terms of like you know my, my earning potential, my sort of a legitimacy in the world, you know it was a middle-aged person versus you know, you as a young person still coming up so that's in college, and you know things like this, uhm, as I said my privilege as a cisgender person and you is a you know is a queer identified trans person, you know all these places that I occupy and here, I guess, I got kind of, uhm, invited to think about you know embracing a very, uhm, reflexive position, looking at privilege, looking at how I want to go forward in the world in a generous and, in a humble way, uhm, your graciousness, you know I think about, uhm, my struggles with family, family members where I you know, we, we are gonna we were locked, locked in the places you know and here you are, you know as a young queer person, transitioning and, and doing that, still having the capacity, the heartfulness to understand your mom as a 70 something year old, uhm, Chinese women and what she, that she sacrificed even though uhm, she shall say things that are really hurtful, or disappointing to you. I mean, that's an amazing lesson. So I think, you know, those are the big things that I think why, why I want to take turn and but also, uhm - 

01:49:35
TIGHEARNAN I have my moments with her to... 

01:49:35
JULIE TILSEN Oh! I am sure you do. Well, yeah, and exactly because of those movements yet, you are still able to sit here, and entertain ways of, uhm, how to keep that conversation going, but also, he is funny, he's got all these great pop cultural references... 

01:49:50
TIGHEARNAN Hmm-hmm. 

01:49:50
JULIE TILSEN Uhm-hmm, he is just funny, uhm, and I shared this with him that he reminds me a lot of queer youth that I've worked with and have, uhm, done other research projects with collaboratively, uhm, and just the willingness you know, I think if there is a Dar Williams' song teenagers kick her ass, you know it's like show us way, uhm, it just-- it just you know love the, the, the energy and the idealism - 

01:50:20
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

01:50:20
JULIE TILSEN - in terms of trying to fight the good fight. So, so I am taking that back with me, I am taking him back with me, and those are reminders in those lessons. 

01:50:30
DAVID NYLUND Well. 

01:50:30
TIGHEARNAN Okay. 

01:50:30
JULIE TILSEN Thank you. 

01:50:35
DAVID NYLUND Thank you.

Microtraining Associates Presents Queer Theory In Action: Theoretical Resources for Therapeutic Conversations Julie Tilsen Ph.D and David Nylund Ph.D Part Two Can you define "queer"? 

01:52:00
JULIE TILSEN Well, I think what's interesting and, and tricky, uhm, about defining queer is that queer itself is something that resists definition and it's not just a d efinition of something that, uhm, uhm, is static or sedimentizes of something in place, uhm, that queer is, uhm, a critic of such things, uhm, and in terms of identities it's a critic of identities itself or identity categories. So, queer is about fluidity, emotion and unpredictability and resisting and challenging, ah, ah, cultural norms, normativity convention. So having said all of that, ah, that the, the queer would standard resistance of definition. What I can say is that some of the definitions that, uhm, it has, uhm, had applied to it, uhm, include you know, something that I think a lot of people would be familiar with, uhm, is queer being a, a, a negative pejorative epithet used, uhm, to describe anybody that's kind of odd, queer, eccentric, uhm, sitting outside of norms that probably makes, uhm, other people won't comfortable, uhm, probably kind of old school use that way, and then more specifically that sort of pejorative use became, uhm, uhm, aimed, ah, at sexual minorities, of people that we now, ah, would categorize as gay, lesbian, bisexual perhaps what we now know as called transgender, queer gender, queer people, uhm, so it became specific, ah, as a pejorative towards those folks, and then, uhm, as definitions turn, uhm, often pejoratives are taken and embraced by, uhm, the groups that they'd have been used against and what we call-- we call reverse discourse, so people that have been called queer in a hurtful oppressive way, gay, lesbian, bisexual trans folks, uhm, took the word queer as sort of a reclamation as a way to organize an identity, uhm, that, ah, rather than challenging the use of the word queer and trying to get rid of it and take something else up, uhm, they say "Okay, I we're queer and, and this is what we, this is something we celebrate and we embody". And then I think another definition of queer, a way queer has been used as that as occurred is something that again happens historically, uhm, within, ah, marginalized communities, activist communities, the language of those communities becomes commodified and taken up for, ah, more dominant and, uhm, ah, uhm, consumer proposes. So you see that in like what the queer is a straight guy, queer as folk, so popular things that, that permeate popular cultural become available to everybody. Uhm, so it becomes commodified and then that takes away, uhm, much of the radical and political intentionality that queer, ah, was also intended to be about. 

01:55:35
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

01:55:35
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, and leaves people to think, ah, that they have an idea what queer is or who queers are, uhm, and it sort of ends up being well that's good gay folk. Uhm, I had-- I had a young person say to me once about the show queer as folk that they should just called the gay as folk. Uhm, and that's because that young person... 

01:55:55
DAVID NYLUND White gay is folk. 

01:55:55
JULIE TILSEN Ah? 

01:55:55
DAVID NYLUND White gay is folk. 

01:55:55
JULIE TILSEN White gay is folk, white, middle-class or better gay as folk, right. And the segway from that thought in terms of where that young person was coming from, I think it's what we share in terms of how we think about and want to organize around queer is its history of being, uhm, about embracing the idea of being outside and resisting those conventions that's so very politically, intentionally political and radical. 

01:56:30
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

01:56:30
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, so, negative epithet for anybody who stands outside of convention, ah, then more particularly deployed against sexual minorities, uhm, taken, taken up as an activist position, ah, to challenge, uhm, uhm, normativity, but then commodified by popular mainstream consumer culture and then what we also see again is, uhm, it sort of being taken up as an umbrella term what you'll see a lot in popular literature and a lot of mainstream practice. 

01:57:05
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

01:57:05
JULIE TILSEN Practice literature is the word queer used as an umbrella term for LGBT people, which again kind of takes away its radical, uhm, intentions of - 

01:57:20
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

01:57:20
JULIE TILSEN - destabilizing convention. 

01:57:20
DAVID NYLUND Sure. 

01:57:25
JULIE TILSEN So. 

01:57:25
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, I, I actually that I think, uhm, that, ah, the way we understand queer is that it's less of a sexual orientation and more of political orientation. It's critique in identity and the limits of identity, that sexuality for instance is too fluid, a desire can't be captured by identity category. Uhm, there is a great quote from a colleague, uhm, Cathy Ruby , who says that, ah, being queer is not matter of being gay, ah, there is no foolproof membership to queerness other than the willingness to seek out resistance decisive(ph) normativity whenever and wherever possible. So... 

01:58:10
What is "queer theory"? 

01:58:15
DAVID NYLUND It, it's drawing upon what we're discussing. I think queer theory has a lot of different historical, ah, trajectories. Uhm, there is a group of scholars in the late 80s, early 90s that found the gay-lesbian studies with somewhat limiting and it address only issues of sexual identity and gender identity, uhm, as if it existed in isolation to other, ah, identity categories like race, class, ah, post-colonialism, colonialism. So, they were drawing upon some work, uhm, (inaudible ) of course history of sexuality is one of the key bodies of work that they were drawing on and Judith Butler in particular who wrote a book called Gender Trouble. Uhm, where she was one of the first people to use the term queer as an academic, ah, inquiry. They were also drawing upon a lot of, uhm, activist circles, queer nation in particular act up who embraced a more radical notion of, of sexual identity as, as a political entity and we were fighting age discrimination and other forms of discrimination against gender and sex minority. So, it was this interesting blind of academics and activists, which was also part an of its appeal. Uhm, the main premise of queer theory is the way we understand it, is it's, uhm, making visible, uhm, what is referred to as heteronormativity. The idea that institute-- our institutions, our political structures, the media, relational practices, uhm, are informed by the idea that heterosexuality is a norm, in which everything is compared against. So, it's, it's making visible the construction, the invention of heterosexuality and historicizing sexuality, including the invention of, of homosexuality. Uhm, so that's one of its main, ah, uhm, investigations. There is a lot of media criticism of how our media representations reinforced heteronormativity in which ways that they disrupted. A new body of work that's emerging out of that is also exposing how mainstream homosexual identity, gay and lesbian identity is mimicking traditional heterosexuality. So, ah, a term calling by another colleague Lisa Duggan, ah, came up with the term homonormativity, which is a homosexual identity that's anchored in domesticity and consumption is, is, ah, depoliticized. That's some of the main work. I think the other appeal as I said earlier with queer theory, ah, at least the scholars that we most connect with is how sexual and gender identity is, ah, intersecting with issues around politics, race, gender, class, post-colonialism, the, the post-colonial subject in non-western cultures. 

02:01:15
What is meant by the "social Construction of gender"? 

02:01:20
JULIE TILSEN You know, basically I think perhaps the main idea to hang on to when we talk about anything being socially constructed is this idea that things are not natural in the sense that we're just born with them and that they're universal, and they're universally experienced and understood across time and place. Uhm, So, social construction is a way of locating, in this case your question, the idea of gender within, uhm, times or historical time and place, cultural place, so that we understand that gender as we, and I might talk about it today here in North America in an urban, in an urban setting in the United States in 2010 is not the understanding that someone across the world in a different context may understand gender. Uhm, and, uhm, it's not what my mom understood at, at-- as an 88-year-old woman, ah, growing up in the same urban center that I did and attending the same high school, uhm, gender meant something very different for her, uhm, you know graduating from Minneapolis West in 1930, something that I did for me in 1980 , uhm, in terms of what was expected and allowed for men and women, uhm, what was available to them, what ideas were conjured, what shared meetings there were or there were assumed to be. Uhm, so, for us, what's important about that is this destabilizing the idea that, that everybody knows what gender is an experience as at the same way in understanding that it's something that is, that comes into being, that has made real and then reified through language practices, how we talk about something, the meaning that gets constructed around it and how we interact with each other around those things. So, dominant notions of gender in any particular time and place are constructed through relationship, through conversation, language practices, ah, that either reify particular meanings as central and assumed and then they become naturalized unquestioned and then other meanings as being non-available, uhm, or not okay. Uhm, so... 

02:04:10
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:04:10
JULIE TILSEN It's still basically it's that the challenging of naturalization and understanding the things are, are culturally and historically contention. 

02:04:20
DAVID NYLUND And, and we thing it's useful in a clinical practice if, if gender is not natural, if it's situated, then, uhm - 

02:04:30
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

02:04:30
DAVID NYLUND - one can, with our clients can bring forth other performances and constructions of gender that are less limiting, that move outside the gender straightjacket or what we call the gender binary. 

02:04:45
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

02:04:45
DAVID NYLUND So, that's why I think it opens up possibilities, as supposed to like men are naturally more leaders or women are naturally more nurturing, uhm, that's, that stereotype can actually reinforce and specify and limit people's, uhm, view of themselves in their gender identity. 

02:05:05
JULIE TILSEN And that speaks to social construction is understanding that, you know our received view of language, what we think is how language operates is that it's just descriptive. But what's also constructionism says is that language is productive. It produces those meanings and knowledges and then it reifies and then reproduces them as we circulate them - 

02:05:25
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:05:30
JULIE TILSEN - amongst ourselves. And in terms of practice, uhm, what's important for us is this idea even just saying men and women, our language is self-centered around men and women that, that becomes, uhm, reproductive of, of this regulation and, and that can-- could sign would say that the limits of my language is the limits of my world, and so as we produce through language, these categories... 

02:05:55
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:06:00
JULIE TILSEN - uhm, it, it limits what people think their options are and it also doesn't account for that, that there are people that, that live outside of those limits. 

02:06:05
DAVID NYLUND Yeah! 

02:06:05
JULIE TILSEN But we don't have the language to, ah, give them voice, uhm, and to help them, help us see them. 

02:06:15
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:06:15
JULIE TILSEN And outcome speak into their experience. So... 

02:06:20
DAVID NYLUND Yeah! 

02:06:20
JULIE TILSEN Yeah! 

02:06:20
DAVID NYLUND I agree. 

02:06:20
What is the "gender binary"? 

02:06:25
DAVID NYLUND It, it's feeding upon what just Julie said is, our language practices a lot of the western languages including English. 

02:06:35
JULIE TILSEN Hmm-hmm. 

02:06:35
DAVID NYLUND Our structure through binary, so it's hard to escape binary thinking, because of the language and its limitation such as, ah, good-bad, white-black, women-men. So, as it relates to the gender binary, it's the assumption that there are only two genders or two sexes of man and woman. And that again limits the ways we can think about gender and, ah, sexuality. And it doesn't account for the multiple, ah, sexualities or sexes and genders that science illustrates. There is a great-- a great quote from a scientist in a, uhm, documentary film, Middlesex, which is different from the novel. 

02:07:20
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

02:07:20
DAVID NYLUND That science loves variation, humans do not. So, uhm, our work, a lot of the work in queer theory is to make visible again the multiple sexes and genders and to not pathologies it because when our disciplines, uhm, psychology, social work, etcetera, uhm, are structured through the binary then anybody who falls outside of that binary, uhm, or above the binary or between is often pathologized including the DSM category gender identity disorder. So, our, our work is to expose that the limitations of that binary and how it pulls us into gender straightjackets and to loosen it a bit to, to get, create some fissures and crevasses on that binary. 

02:08:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, we propose that the GID, ah, is re-termed or renamed Gender Inflexibility Disorder. 

02:08:15
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:08:15
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

02:08:20
DAVID NYLUND That's going to be in DSM 12. 

02:08:20
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

02:08:25
What are some of your earliest memories of the gender binary? 

02:08:30
DAVID NYLUND Some of my earliest memories growing up. Ah, I grew up in working class Detroit . Uhm, we lived in a first ring suburb outside Detroit . And, uhm, when I was three or four, I remember, uhm, asking my mom to give me some Barbies, so went on and bought some Barbies. And, uhm, my dad found out that's same day and became incredibly enraged with my mom , and was at least verbally abusive. I don't know if there was more and went out and bought some GI Joes and took the Barbies away from me. So, I remember being really sacred of my dad because of that and also like, okay, I guess there are certain, ah, things that I'm interested in and I can't have, because I am a boy and then, as I got older and went to school, to kindergarten, I found out those same limitations and so in response to that I found you know, if I talked sports, that was sports corrective and measure or move then, then I somehow was in the boys club. Uhm, because I got tired of, uhm, being called a Sissy or smear the queer. So that, that was-- that's what, uhm, really had a influence on me that I think drew me eventually to, uhm, some of the ideas we're talking about. 

02:10:00
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, you know, I uhm, I, I certainly remember as a little kid, you know I was dubbed a tomboy and that wasn't necessarily bad thing, uhm, but it was a different thing. And you know as you know, we we're going back, uhm, you know, 40, 40 years, uhm, looking back at these times, you know 30-40 years, uhm, it's certainly constructing these memories with some of these ideas that I have now, but it was a different thing and in some things it was cool, because you know I could throw a softball 100 feet and I could throw a football through a tire hanging on a rope in a tree with a perfect spiral and you know. 

02:10:50
DAVID NYLUND Wow, I couldn't do that! 

02:10:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, I know you couldn't. And I could sit in-- sit in the driveway and, and make, uhm, and chalk on the-- on the patio wall, target and sit there and flip wrist shots and slap shots and get, get into the center, uhm, you know. 

02:11:05
DAVID NYLUND I think you're awesome. 

02:11:05
JULIE TILSEN Shoot scores. Yeah. You know, I could do those things and then I had some cache. Uhm, and, and yet you know on my jean jacket, my mom brought this patch with the, the woman sing-- signal that says I'm girl and she sewed that on. And, uhm, at that time I thought kind of funny, but now you know I wonder what that was like for her having this little girl that people didn't always know, she was a little girl. And you know, these are just wonderings. But how was that important for her to sort of - 

02:11:40
DAVID NYLUND Right! 

02:11:40
JULIE TILSEN - you know brand me in some way to label that. And then certainly, you know, getting into junior high, in middle school and high school, that's where I think some of those experiences of construction and gender, gender binaries and things you're asking about definitely became apparent, because I think you know, we're coming into a sexuality and supposed to be, you know starting to be interested in things. And you know I started noting that, you know girls are supposed to carry their textbooks and stuff, kind of like this and you now if you have a hip here hopefully your, you know your budding hips, you know kind of carrying that, whereas guys got to you know hang them down here. And it's like, I would force myself to do this, because this is really fun I'm not comfortable to carry my book that way or, uhm, you know just thinking about a lot about cloths and hair and, uhm, some of the things that I was good at doing in sports were still valued, but they needed to be funneled into certain things, uhm, in certain ways. Uhm, and so it definitely became more aware of that gaze. 

02:12:50
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:12:50
JULIE TILSEN G-A-Z-E! Uhm, and feeling different and not as attractive or things like that. Well, also it was-- it was kind of this bifurcated experience, because I was also very smart and popular in some ways and, and involved and you know a leader, but there was this way I know that I was different and didn't, didn't fit in, you know in, in, in, in the, you know the, the Noah's Arkin(ph) of paring up kids you know for, for dances and things like that. 

02:13:25
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:13:25
JULIE TILSEN So, I was definitely aware of that. 

02:13:25
DAVID NYLUND Hmm. 

02:13:30
JULIE TILSEN And it was painful at times. 

02:13:30
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:13:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

02:13:35
What if society could move beyond the constriction of the gender binary? 

02:13:40
JULIE TILSEN Uhm. Okay! Uhm, well, I think that rather than being a binary system or it will be a system of, uhm, multiplicity and flexibility, ah, I don't know that we ever escape systems, you know in as much as I guess we say a system being a cultural discourse of guiding meta narratives. Uhm, so yeah, it would be-- it would be rather than a gender binary, it would be, uhm, uhm, a system of multiplicity and flexibility where, uhm, the proliferation of gender performances, identities, expressions, uhm, could, could be experienced and in which, on one hand we're never surprised like of course-- of course there is something different or that's an interest or that, that. So, we're never surprised and we have room for that, but we're also kind of always surprised in the sense of being curious and in wonder and, and appreciative of something new that, that's emerged. Uhm, and I think in moving from a binary system to one of flexibility and multiplicity, what would be eradicated then is gender based oppression. Uhm, because, the specifications and regulations wouldn't be there to be enforced so that people aren't policed and punished, ah, or rewarded based on how they, ah, uhm - 

02:15:15
DAVID NYLUND You're right! 

02:15:20
JULIE TILSEN - ascribe to the specification. So, it wouldn't-- it wouldn't-- it wouldn't be oppressive that way. Uhm - 

02:15:25
DAVID NYLUND Right, in, in terms of, ah, some ways that it might show up, ah, specifically is one might start with, ah, when, ah, one is pregnant and-- or called "expecting" the, ah, the first question would not be, is it a boy or girl? It might be a whole series of other questions that may be one can imagine right now. So that's, that's one thing. I think, uhm, that one would, uhm, ah, pick what they're interested in not based on gender, but what they're good at. Uhm, that gender would not limit. And it shows up in a lot of areas like sports, uhm, ah, well I, I can't go into math as a woman, because women are not supposedly good at math. Their brain structure is, according to the scientist like that. So, there would be less limitations placed on what one is interested in and it creates more, uhm, open possibility. And I think the other one that comes to mind is that once, ah, preferences or, ah, a desires would be, uhm, not based on gender or sex, but the qualities of the-- of the person. Lastly, uhm, and we've done some work on this, uhm, is that there wouldn't be a binary of what's a good and bad sex act. That all sex of consensual would be supported. Uhm, such as in open relationship, uhm, would not be seen as less than versus a committed monogamous relationship, which is seen as the healthier so. 

02:17:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah! Uhm, you wouldn't have to go searching for the right bathroom. That bathrooms would tell you, ah, what was in it. You know, there is sink, there is toilet. Ah, I like to see ones that had mirrors. Ah, so, that's kind of what I needed as I... 

02:17:25
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:17:30
JULIE TILSEN A sink, a toilet and a mirror and a door. 

02:17:30
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:17:30
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, ah, but, we wouldn't have to go searching, ah, for bathrooms and so then there wouldn't be people suffering, uhm, and kids sitting in school all day, cooking up bladder infections and things like that. Uhm, so I think-- I think that that would be - 

02:17:45
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:17:45
JULIE TILSEN - a practical thing that we would see. Uhm, and I think our conversations with people, uhm, would necessarily become longer and richer and more complex, because we wouldn't have the shortcut of organizing around a category that we think we know what it means. If someone says, well I met this guy or someone says even, uhm, I, ah, went and worked with these young trans men, even, even things like that are starting to get sedimented. Uhm, and things that had been on the outside start kind of getting socially constructed to have meanings that we think we know what they are, we would have to ask more about well, who was this person or who are you? How do you want me to know you? What's important for me to know about you? Rather than organizing around. Oh, I know what it means if you are a woman. Uhm... 

02:18:45
DAVID NYLUND Right, right. 

02:18:50
JULIE TILSEN And I mean, if, if you were to spend a day, uhm, having conversation where you took out any gendered language, so pronouns, first names that, uhm, we assign gender too, you know, ah, familiar language, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa, anything that's gender and if you had a day without those conversations, it would be like either, uhm, gridlock you know in downtown Chicago during a blown-out or a multi-car crash on you know, Interstate 94 during rush hour through the Lowry Tunnel in Minneapolis . It would just-- it would be this that people couldn't-- wouldn't know they have to talk, they'd have to ask questions, they'd have to be descriptive in new ways. 

02:19:35
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:19:35
JULIE TILSEN And I think that would be a way. 

02:19:40
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:19:40
JULIE TILSEN That... that would be different. 

02:19:40
DAVID NYLUND Maybe-- I mean, there would be so many-- but one of that just came out for me is, ah, you know, parochial schools and other schools is of all boy schools or in all girl school, or even a co-ed school that, that would, ah, dissipate, which should be a big crevasse on the educational system. 

02:20:05
What would you like counselors/therapists to take away from this? 

02:20:15
JULIE TILSEN I think that's probably if you're watching this and you only had a couple of minutes start here, because it's the most important part. A few things come to my mind, uhm, one would be is although here Dave and I were talking about a lot of theoretical or philosophical and conceptual ideas that we see as important theoretical and conversational resources. I think we agree that theory is only as good as it serves to elevate peoples lived experiences, that it helps to find ways to bring forward, articulate, advocate for and make room for the people we're working with. 

02:20:55
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:20:55
JULIE TILSEN That theory can't lead the show here. So that would be one and the second thing would be, uhm, as you're watching, uhm, the sessions that session Dave does with Gwen , and session I do with Tighearnan , and then the conversations we have in reflection afterwards with them is to not think about us in what we're doing, ah, good, bad or otherwise, but to think about, uhm, what, what is Tighearnan and Gwen , what can you learn from them? Not about them, but what are they here to teach you? Uhm, how, how can they invite you, uhm, into, may be unhinging some things to keep you, you stuck personally and professionally? 

02:21:40
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:21:40
JULIE TILSEN To position them as, uhm, that, that their lived experiences and insider knowledges, uhm, are, are as valuable as anything we have to offer. 

02:21:55
DAVID NYLUND Ah, I, I am to add to that I would, uhm, invite them to notice their reactions to - 

02:22:00
JULIE TILSEN Hmm-hmm. 

02:22:00
DAVID NYLUND - uhm, Gwen and Tighearnan and how it might upset some of their notions of what constitutes a man or a woman and - 

02:22:10
JULIE TILSEN Or a queer trans person. 

02:22:15
DAVID NYLUND - or queer. Exactly! 

02:22:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

02:22:15
DAVID NYLUND And how, uhm, our training as therapists, as clinicians is been mainly around assessment and evaluation, and that evaluation is not neutral, that evaluation is fed by some of exactly what we're talking about, these traditional normative discourses that gender binary and how it might be easy to move into spaces of evaluation, judgment and even using, ah, medical discourses or the DSM to justify that. So, to notice some of their reactions, and then to find ways, uhm, to bring forth other meanings and other possibilities that could open up space, not only with their work with clients, but, but mainly their own notions of, of their own gender and sexually no limitations and expectations when it's placed on themselves. And in doing so, then one might find that the, the, uhm, the courage and heroism it takes for people to live outside the binary. Uhm, and, ah, Gwen and I think Tighearnan are, are examples of that. Uhm, in terms of putting themselves, ah, because they're out, uhm, in public including this tape, it, it puts some them at, at great risk. And this is, you know working with clients who have, uhm, attempted suicide or, or been murdered by transphobia, ah, a person who has been murd-- ah, murdered other hate crime. So, uhm, I think-- I think that is important. It also along with that, uhm, could be easy to get into, well who is Gwen , is she transgender, is she gender queer, wanting to fix that person - 

02:24:00
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

02:24:00
DAVID NYLUND - to make sense of it. And what we find more useful is, why we even ask that question and what are the limitations of that question, what's excluded out of that question? Uhm - 

02:24:15
JULIE TILSEN How would asking a question like who are you or what are you? 

02:24:15
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:24:15
JULIE TILSEN Even-- how does that make a difference? How-- what would you do with that? 

02:24:20
DAVID NYLUND Right! You, you'll notice in the tape that we don't ask those questions, but more we might ask questions of how, how the larger, uhm, ideas about sex and gender police us, in ways that they've found ways to, uhm, to stand up to that policing. 

02:24:40
[sil.] 

02:24:45
DAVID NYLUND Uhm, why don't we start out going by talking about how we first started working together, how long it's been? 

02:24:50
GWEN Uhm, I do believe it's, let's see a year and eight months now - 

02:24:55
DAVID NYLUND Wow! 

02:24:55
GWEN - I think. 

02:24:55
DAVID NYLUND Quite some time. 

02:24:55
GWEN Yeah. Yeah. 

02:25:00
DAVID NYLUND Why, why don't you share a little bit about what brought you to see me and we'll go from there - 

02:25:05
GWEN Uhm, well like going back to - 

02:25:05
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:25:05
GWEN - my first choice to... 

02:25:05
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:25:10
GWEN Well, okay. Uhm, about November of 2007, I made a deal with myself to actually quit smoking. The way I did it was I think you've heard this story. 

02:25:20
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:25:25
GWEN I said to myself you know, if I was gonna ever gonna live as a women, uhm, I, I'd want to give-- I wanna live for as long as possible. So with that goal in mind I, I quit smoking and it was with that goal-- keeping that goal in mind - 

02:25:45
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:25:45
GWEN - it was like quite easy for me to quit. I mean I-- the withdraws were always greeted with a little (inaudible ) refer me like of you know, if I want to-- if I wanna transition I got to live as long as possible. So I don't smoke anymore and then when that was successful. I, I, I made a deal with myself on, on a week because at that point I, I weighed 344 pounds. 

02:26:15
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:26:15
GWEN But because, basically I've been told the point where I started making all these little bribes to myself these little-- these little deals I, I had been basically trying to die as quickly as possible without actually committing suicide - 

02:26:35
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:26:35
GWEN - and hence you know, pissed off everybody who ever in me - 

02:26:40
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:26:40
GWEN So, so and then that was easy and it, it where, where I should have been kind of happy all the this from this successes of quitting smoking and you know, the initial success of - 

02:27:00
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:27:00
GWEN - loosing all that weight so quickly. Uhm, it kind of depressed me because its, it added a further pressure like, okay, I've come this far. I, I-- where do I go from here and you know at that point and time I, I had a job around which I based my day. 

02:27:25
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:27:25
GWEN Because basically I was trying to keep things in a rhythm to where I wouldn't you know notice so much of what was going on around me. Just be trying to keep - 

02:27:40
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:27:40
GWEN - at a kinetic phase that you know, a rather their rinse repeat type of life. I wake up - 

02:27:50
DAVID NYLUND Oh, like that. 

02:27:50
GWEN I go to work. I, I come home, I eat, I sleep. 

02:27:55
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:27:55
GWEN Basically the goal for the day was to get back to sleep. To get back to unconsciousness because, uhm, as, as, you know, as I made all these deals with myself and got more and more depressed you know, it, it got to the point where you know, I'd, I'd wake up and face the prospect of - 

02:28:15
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:28:15
GWEN - having come this far and stopping myself and, and you know I was-- I'd wake up and then start crying then, oh I'm still stuck in this life. 

02:28:30
GWEN Hmm-hmm. 

02:28:30
GWEN Then I-- then I got lucky, ah, I got fired from my job and I was at first you know, oh god what the hell am I gonna do - 

02:28:45
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:28:45
GWEN And my mom who I'd been talking to about, uhm, you know my, my issues with my gender and wanting to transition to, to a female who, who she was the first one who you know, back three-- four years ago since you know, if you are so depressed with being a man why don't you-- why don't you transition? 

02:29:15
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:29:15
GWEN At, at that point I wasn't hearing it you know, basically because I came up with all sorts of little - 

02:29:20
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:29:20
GWEN - little like a excuses saying, uhm, well, you know the surgeries only cause cosmetic or blah, blah, blah, basically trying to convince myself to ignore or ignore the problem as best I can and just - 

02:29:40
DAVID NYLUND And you had - 

02:29:40
GWEN - get to there. 

02:29:40
DAVID NYLUND - you had a history of ignoring - 

02:29:40
GWEN Yeah. Yeah. 

02:29:40
DAVID NYLUND - problems. 

02:29:45
GWEN Well, yeah. Uhm, well who doesn't, really but yeah, uhm - 

02:29:50
DAVID NYLUND In some ways it seems like the, the problem got you to ignore yourself - 

02:29:55
GWEN Exactly. 

02:29:55
DAVID NYLUND - and you're in some extend. 

02:29:55
GWEN Exactly it was-- it was like a-- I live in a mansion but I only stay in the entry hall. 

02:30:00
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:30:00
GWEN You know, uhm, some I-- loosing the job I lost that one little thing and around which I had a little kinetic motion to - 

02:30:15
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:30:20
GWEN - you know move for the life and, uhm, my mom basically came, came to me with this option that basically she was sick and tired of watching me just suffer. 

02:30:35
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:30:35
GWEN So she offered to have me just move in and, ah, my job would be work on the transition. So that's... 

02:30:45
DAVID NYLUND That's how you came... 

02:30:45
GWEN Yeah. That's where it all started as far as me going out and to the community. 

02:30:55
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:30:55
GWEN And, ah, and finding out what I needed to do from, from a friend who like I met actually, because of my mom . We - 

02:31:05
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:31:05
GWEN - ah, we, we have the gents in this area. 

02:31:10
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:31:10
GWEN And... 

02:31:10
DAVID NYLUND Which is, uhm - 

02:31:10
GWEN Yeah. 

02:31:10
DAVID NYLUND - the social group for, uhm, people who are, uhm, is called celebrate in a feminine experience. 

02:31:20
GWEN Yeah. 

02:31:20
DAVID NYLUND Or transgender women some cross dressing women - 

02:31:20
GWEN Yeah, yeah. 

02:31:20
DAVID NYLUND So you got hooked up with them... 

02:31:25
GWEN Yeah. 

02:31:25
DAVID NYLUND - and that helped - 

02:31:25
GWEN That helped and at that point you know I started talking to - 

02:31:30
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:31:30
GWEN - to other people who had experiences like me and, and there was kind of a revelation because, uhm, up until that point I hadn't related to any one as - 

02:31:45
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:31:45
GWEN - another human being. They were you know if I saw myself as a phantom and people other people are basically obstacles - 

02:31:55
DAVID NYLUND Right. Right. 

02:31:55
GWEN For me to-- for me to have to confront - 

02:32:00
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:32:00
GWEN ...on a daily basis but really there is I didn't care what was going on inside them and really I was trying to ignore what was going on inside me. But I-- in meeting these people it was-- it was very, ah, I, I, I use the term disturbing, but I, I don't mean it in a bad way. It - 

02:32:20
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:32:25
GWEN - it disrupted, disrupted that set in stone type of mentality where - 

02:32:30
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:32:30
GWEN Oh, I actually understand what another person saying - 

02:32:35
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:32:35
GWEN - which is empathy was, was the thing that I - 

02:32:40
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:32:40
GWEN - missed for a long time and, and - 

02:32:45
DAVID NYLUND Okay, so - 

02:32:45
GWEN - being turned on to it was revelation. 

02:32:50
DAVID NYLUND So understanding another human being is that partly you started to understand yourself more. 

02:32:55
GWEN Hmmm. 

02:33:00
DAVID NYLUND Is that were you were you... 

02:33:00
GWEN I made connections within myself... 

02:33:05
DAVID NYLUND Okay. 

02:33:05
GWEN I, I guess it is the term I-- I'd guess you know, I'm still trying to - 

02:33:10
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:33:10
GWEN - fully understand myself. 

02:33:10
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:33:10
GWEN Uhm. 

02:33:10
DAVID NYLUND Okay, so what stands out to you about the work together what you've done since-- what stands out to with some of the things you've learned about yourself or - 

02:33:25
GWEN Oh well-- I, I've definitely learned like I don't want, the biggest thing is how much more confident - 

02:33:35
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:33:35
GWEN I am as a person. Uhm, before you know I, I before all of this, uhm, I basically used physical my physical presence as a point of I don't know-- ah, kind of intimidating people and to you know just not, not approaching me - 

02:34:00
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:34:05
GWEN Uhm, but, but now, now that I don't know now that I had, I'm using all the tools - 

02:34:10
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:34:15
GWEN - that I have emotionally. I'm not so I'm not so stand off as I - 

02:34:20
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:34:20
GWEN I know I can engage with people and, and not have to be threatened by you know by closeness or - 

02:34:30
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:34:30
GWEN - anything like that - 

02:34:30
DAVID NYLUND You've done a number of things including going to, uhm, a support group on Sundays. So were mentioning. So what's happen since our last our, our last meeting you went to the group - 

02:34:45
GWEN Oh yeah, I, I went to the group which I haven't been doing for, for around about three or four months - 

02:34:50
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:34:50
GWEN - I, I went to the group, ah, last Sunday and then just this Sunday. 

02:34:55
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:35:00
GWEN Uhm, that I had been a avoiding it basically because, ah, I-- in the group there is-- there is a narrative that persists that you know, uhm, I often times hear paraphrasing hear how much other, other people in the group hate the male aspect of themselves. 

02:35:20
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:35:25
GWEN And I-- and I would admit to, to-- at the, at first about a year and a half ago to act-- actively hating you know, oh, I-- my, ah, my male name is Nick . So I'd associate you know, everything that was Nick - 

02:35:45
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:35:45
GWEN - with my past life and - 

02:35:45
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:35:45
GWEN You know I'd, I'd basically kind of went hatred towards, towards you know my... 

02:35:55
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:35:55
GWEN You know, who I was in the past... 

02:35:55
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:35:55
GWEN And, and often times I'll hear in the group like basically their animosity to the things they had to do as males - 

02:36:10
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:36:10
GWEN - uhm, boys does animosity towards you know, you know whatever their name is - 

02:36:15
DAVID NYLUND Right, right. So you'd be like animosity towards Nick . 

02:36:20
GWEN Yeah, like, uhm, like I'd given example of you know, ah, I'm so glad I don't have to act like - 

02:36:30
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:36:35
GWEN You know, just girl - 

02:36:40
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, yeah. 

02:36:40
GWEN But, uhm, so-- and I do you know there is-- there is a level of-- I also hear terms like, ah, I just wish my male half would just die or - 

02:36:50
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:36:55
GWEN You know, uhm... 

02:36:55
DAVID NYLUND And, and where, where are you with that now? 

02:36:55
GWEN Now? For me now and this is why I'm avoiding the group because - 

02:37:00
DAVID NYLUND Right, right. 

02:37:00
GWEN - that, that narrative persists. For me now it's I don't know why, why its different for, for me but, uhm, my male aspect. My the, the what I projected before. 

02:37:25
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:37:25
GWEN Uhm, it was lot of the, the metaphor that runs through the communities, you know it's, it's a mask - 

02:37:35
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:37:35
GWEN - like, uhm, you know something you've peace together from a foreign elements and now and you throw it up in front of - 

02:37:45
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:37:45
GWEN And between your true self and, and people and, and people are same to you, resent that mask like, like it's something foreign. But what I'm what I've, what I've learned now or what I've learned - 

02:38:05
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:38:05
GWEN - at least for myself is none of-- none of Nick is a foreign element. 

02:38:10
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:38:10
GWEN None of and, uhm, like, uhm, Nick was 10% of Gwen basically. 

02:38:20
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:38:25
GWEN You know, uhm... 

02:38:25
DAVID NYLUND Okay. 

02:38:25
GWEN I can, I can take all the bad-- you know all the parts of Nick and that's reintegrate - 

02:38:35
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:38:35
GWEN - them into, into myself. 

02:38:35
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:38:40
GWEN Is, is no longer so much - 

02:38:40
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:38:40
GWEN I got to put, put everything in the past... 

02:38:45
DAVID NYLUND Sure... 

02:38:45
GWEN Just I got to take that-- take that with me as well as find out you know what my new boundaries are - 

02:38:55
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:38:55
GWEN What are my new you know-- it's like, uhm, I don't know if-- if you lived life with one hand tied behind your back all your life - 

02:39:05
DAVID NYLUND Alright. 

02:39:05
GWEN - suddenly you, you cut the hand free - 

02:39:10
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:39:10
GWEN - its like this you don't-- you don't become one armed to the other hand. Its - 

02:39:15
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:39:15
GWEN - now you-- now you have... 

02:39:20
DAVID NYLUND The both hands... 

02:39:20
GWEN You know, yeah. You are free... 

02:39:20
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:39:20
GWEN It's a lot freer than, ah, than the what I hear as the narrative going through - 

02:39:30
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:39:30
GWEN - there are lot of-- lot of peoples transgender experience that you know - 

02:39:35
DAVID NYLUND And, and that's not feeling your experience now. What, what parts of Nick or what qualities of Nick are you bringing forward? 

02:39:45
GWEN Uhm. 

02:39:45
DAVID NYLUND Into who are becoming-- what are some of those qualities or ways of being - 

02:39:50
GWEN My, my basically my likes and taste as Nick you know, uhm, ah, I've always been kind of an outsider kind of gee, gee type of person. 

02:40:05
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:40:05
GWEN Hmm. 

02:40:05
DAVID NYLUND Cool... 

02:40:05
GWEN One of-- one of the-- one of my favorite hobbies is, uhm, you know was always pen and paper gaming stuff like that with, with my friends and - 

02:40:20
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:40:25
GWEN You know, I, I at first I was thinking how well, you know, ah, I'm, I'm gonna have to give all this up because you know that's not very "girly"... 

02:40:35
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh 

02:40:35
GWEN Like, like you know I gotta give up certain - 

02:40:40
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:40:40
GWEN - certain aspects of what I-- what I honestly like to... 

02:40:45
DAVID NYLUND Where, where do you think that came from that you had to give up certain, uhm - 

02:40:50
GWEN Hmm. 

02:40:50
DAVID NYLUND - interest or ways of being because it wasn't feminine... 

02:40:55
GWEN Yeah. 

02:40:55
DAVID NYLUND Where did you think that came... 

02:40:55
GWEN Society. 

02:40:55
DAVID NYLUND Society... 

02:40:55
GWEN Uhm, you know, ah, there is-- there is a whole bunch of you know, things women are expected to enjoy... 

02:41:05
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:41:10
GWEN The I, I didn't know there is a just like extreme like oh, take up Nadine or you know... 

02:41:15
DAVID NYLUND Ha, ha, ha. 

02:41:15
GWEN You know, take up Celine like... 

02:41:20
DAVID NYLUND You haven't done that yet... 

02:41:20
GWEN I'm not good with my hands. I'm tired. You know, you know it's-- you know there is kind of feminine accepted hobbies and those kind of masculine accepted hobbies - 

02:41:30
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:41:35
GWEN I but I'm sorry I, I hate working on cars and I'd break a nail, but you know at the same time, uhm, you know I don't think I'm good at take up selling because - 

02:41:45
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:41:50
GWEN - that seems just as dolls(ph). 

02:41:50
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. Yeah. So, so initially and the group felt that along or some of the community that you are involved with - 

02:41:55
GWEN Yeah. 

02:41:55
DAVID NYLUND - that you had to give up certain interest or certain ways of being that are assigned to quote masculine by society. 

02:42:05
GWEN Yeah. 

02:42:05
DAVID NYLUND How, how did you begin to, to expose societies dictates and come to your own ways of being your own gender - 

02:42:15
GWEN Basically the-- these, these revelations came to me when I-- when I started coming out with my friends - 

02:42:20
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:42:20
GWEN Uhm, like I said, I-- I've always been kind of an outsider - 

02:42:30
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh 

02:42:30
GWEN And I-- I've always gravitated to people who socially are outside the norm in - 

02:42:35
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:42:35
GWEN - the first place, uhm... 

02:42:35
DAVID NYLUND Is that something you value by yourself. 

02:42:40
GWEN Well, I, I value what that has done for me actually. 

02:42:45
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. Okay. 

02:42:45
GWEN As, uhm, and so obviously since I am the some told my experiences of course I, I value that about myself - 

02:42:55
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:42:55
GWEN - I guess. It is the way to put that. 

02:43:00
DAVID NYLUND Okay. 

02:43:00
GWEN But you know so, so when I started coming out with friends they were basically I-- I've been very lucky and that everyone I've talked to is like well, you are still the same person. You don't fall in - 

02:43:15
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:43:15
GWEN We don't-- we don't-- we don't love you because you know of who, who you are or what you wear or whatever-- it's you know who you are on the inside that is what attracted to you to - 

02:43:35
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:43:35
GWEN - or attracted us to you or you to us - 

02:43:35
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:43:40
GWEN So, so it's, it's kind of like I'm, I'm free to I, I was free to you basically have more to discussions with them - 

02:43:50
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:43:50
GWEN - and, uhm, kind of bring Gwen into the circle like, uhm, nowadays when-- whenever we meet for our little gig sessions - 

02:44:05
DAVID NYLUND Ha, ha, ha. 

02:44:05
GWEN - in the old days and oh my half takes two down age, yeah... 

02:44:10
DAVID NYLUND Ha, ha, ha. 

02:44:10
GWEN Uhm, now-- nowadays when we meet I'm usually dressed. If at a minimum I have you know nail polish on and my earrings on - 

02:44:25
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:44:25
GWEN - and which is-- which you know, it's very freeing to you be myself around... 

02:44:35
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:44:35
GWEN You know... 

02:44:35
DAVID NYLUND And, and you are able to be more yourself, ah, because of who you are as Gwen - 

02:44:45
GWEN Yeah. 

02:44:45
DAVID NYLUND - and, and but you are also able to bring forth and keep close to your certain qualities that were - 

02:44:50
GWEN Well that, that - 

02:44:50
DAVID NYLUND - part of me like we are saying... 

02:44:55
GWEN - that I thought I'd have to... 

02:44:55
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:44:55
GWEN You know leave at the way aside... 

02:44:55
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:44:55
GWEN You know leave it in my past, but my past is my future-- my future is my past... 

02:45:05
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. It-- in your transition I think partly with your friends who've accepted that you don't have to-- you are just who you are. 

02:45:10
GWEN Uh-huh. 

02:45:10
DAVID NYLUND Your conscious and realization I'm, I'm getting a sense that some of these qualities are not gender qualities but just preferences. 

02:45:20
GWEN Yeah. 

02:45:20
DAVID NYLUND You know. 

02:45:20
GWEN Exactly. 

02:45:20
DAVID NYLUND And part of that has been you being able to make visible some of these-- this gender binary - 

02:45:25
GWEN Yeah, yeah, you know like, uhm, thinking I'm gonna have to give up liking death metal or... 

02:45:35
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:45:35
GWEN You know, it's, ah, its, it's just kind of you know funny what the way the stoppers society make, makes people put on themselves. 

02:45:50
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, and you've been able to loosen that up-- to unhinge yourself a bit from it. 

02:45:55
GWEN Hmm. 

02:45:55
DAVID NYLUND Uhm, is there-- see if this makes sense-- is there as you, uhm, are moving in your transition, uhm, is there are you more free to be the positive qualities of Nick when you were-- when you were Nick ? 

02:46:15
GWEN Oh, yeah, oh yeah. And, uhm... 

02:46:15
DAVID NYLUND Is that make sense? 

02:46:15
GWEN Yeah, I, I, I think I see what your - 

02:46:20
DAVID NYLUND Ah-huh. 

02:46:20
GWEN - you put out there because like and like I was originally saying as, as Nick to keep people from actually knowing me past, past for certain boundary pass, you know - 

02:46:35
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:46:35
GWEN You know, you know seeing pass mask and actually saying oh, there is-- there is a women in there. 

02:46:40
DAVID NYLUND Ah-huh. 

02:46:45
GWEN You know, uhm, I, I'd have to constantly bring out the negatives you know - 

02:46:50
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:46:50
GWEN - you know not, not actually go after people and say I going to punch you or anything but just giving the impression that I was just that close to slap. 

02:47:00
DAVID NYLUND Okay. 

02:47:05
GWEN You know. 

02:47:05
DAVID NYLUND So performing some of those traditional emotions of manhood you know, that fit for your ghetto almost... 

02:47:05
GWEN Yeah, the putting in up-- putting in up the front that you know I see all men doing, doing now that, now that I've step back from it. All, all men put up a certain front to kind of, ah, you know man the barricades, so - 

02:47:30
DAVID NYLUND I have no idea what you're taking about. 

02:47:30
GWEN Hmm-hmm, yeah, of course. 

02:47:30
DAVID NYLUND So you'll-- you noticing even more as Gwen then you were - 

02:47:35
GWEN Yeah. 

02:47:35
DAVID NYLUND Okay. 

02:47:35
GWEN Yeah, and like, like I have friend who is-- I've come out you know. 

02:47:45
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:47:45
GWEN - and, uhm. And I, I, I was telling him how guilty I felt because I wasn't really present in his life. Because I was dealing with issues out - 

02:48:00
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:48:00
GWEN - of my own, uhm, when he was going through a very, ah, rough time where he was depressed and had become self injurious - 

02:48:10
DAVID NYLUND Ah-huh. 

02:48:10
GWEN - I would but at that point I, I was kind of in a cocoon of, of my own making so I would separate from him and didn't, didn't really-- did not really reach out to him at that time luckily he, he was able to get counseling and get through. But I was talking to him we were just sitting and having coffee on day and I'm-- I was basically you know wanted to voice you know, I'm sorry I, I wasn't really present in your life when I might have been able to help - 

02:48:45
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:48:45
GWEN - you know and. 

02:48:45
DAVID NYLUND So it seems like your more able to be present to others and - 

02:48:50
GWEN Yeah. 

02:48:50
DAVID NYLUND - embrace more of, of a relations stuff - 

02:48:55
GWEN Yeah. 

02:48:55
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, and yet still bring forward parts of Nick - 

02:49:00
GWEN Yeah. 

02:49:00
DAVID NYLUND - so is there some parts of you now that you, uhm, are noticing that you didn't have when you were...? 

02:49:10
GWEN Oh, is - 

02:49:10
DAVID NYLUND What is the qualities you are learning about you self or? 

02:49:10
GWEN Ah, compassion. 

02:49:10
DAVID NYLUND Ah-huh. 

02:49:15
GWEN Uhm, you know and the, the wiliness to actually communicate and connect with other people. 

02:49:20
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:49:20
GWEN Uhm, like I said I, I don't have to man the man the barricades anymore, I can - 

02:49:30
DAVID NYLUND Ah-huh. 

02:49:30
GWEN I can-- I can you know get down on the ground and meet and greet people and you know, ah, be open about myself and let them know who I am. Rather than you know, constantly thinking I'm, I'm under, under siege from the - 

02:49:45
DAVID NYLUND Right, right. 

02:49:45
GWEN - from the rest of the world. 

02:49:50
DAVID NYLUND What, what do you-- what do you think that people that your developing connections with - 

02:49:55
GWEN Hmm-hmm. 

02:50:00
DAVID NYLUND What do you think they value or appreciate about you. What is they notice in you? 

02:50:05
GWEN Uhm, one thing I constantly hear is confidence, uhm, even before I came out to my friends - 

02:50:15
DAVID NYLUND Ah-huh. 

02:50:15
GWEN - uhm, and when, when I was in the dropping stage that's some that's going on - 

02:50:25
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:50:25
GWEN - things are, there are going to be changes but not voicing what that was. 

02:50:30
DAVID NYLUND Ah-huh. 

02:50:30
GWEN They would always come back and say well we know something is going on and we know is good because your like a lot more confident then you used to be. 

02:50:40
DAVID NYLUND Right, right. 

02:50:40
GWEN And I-- and I feel that too. 

02:50:45
DAVID NYLUND You, you feel it? 

02:50:45
GWEN Yeah. 

02:50:45
DAVID NYLUND And, and what it like for, for others to notice it? 

02:50:50
GWEN Ah, it's very, very satisfying. 

02:50:55
DAVID NYLUND Hmm. Hmm. Okay. 

02:50:55
GWEN Ah, to me, to, to no longer you know, that, that expression you know in order to - 

02:51:05
DAVID NYLUND Hmm-hmm. 

02:51:10
GWEN - be loved, you have to love yourself. 

02:51:10
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:51:10
GWEN To know that and you know someone is actually seeing the I-- I'm respecting myself-- that I - 

02:51:20
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:51:20
GWEN - that I am taking care of myself - 

02:51:20
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:51:20
GWEN - and loving myself. Even though I always hate those little expressions like one last love. 

02:51:30
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, yeah, it's kind of cliché - 

02:51:30
GWEN Yeah. 

02:51:30
DAVID NYLUND And there is something that fits for you in terms of, ah, more embracing self-respect because, because you all do what which you call instead of self-respect. 

02:51:40
GWEN Yeah, it was basically self-defense. 

02:51:45
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, yeah, so. Uhm, the confidence that you're-- that you are noticing, other people are noticing. 

02:51:55
GWEN Uh-huh. 

02:51:55
DAVID NYLUND Do you think that some of our gender system undermines people's confidence in themselves is that make sense? 

02:52:00
GWEN Yeah, because. 

02:52:05
DAVID NYLUND Could you-- could you speak a bit to that? 

02:52:05
GWEN Well you know as I'm, as I'm kind of between spaces - 

02:52:10
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, yeah. 

02:52:10
GWEN - as I'm going through this transition. I can look back and see men are expected to not only not show their emotions. They are expected to as best as they can, not have emotions, just you know. 

02:52:30
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:52:30
GWEN You know, defend, defend the-- defend the tribe and you know it goes back to those old, old - 

02:52:40
DAVID NYLUND Sure 

02:52:40
GWEN - ancient roles, but so men are basically they have to act as if a whole section of their self, is amputated. And women on the other hand as I, as I've noted are expected to you know be, keep their, keep their lance a lot more tightly focused on you know, pleasing other people - 

02:53:15
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:53:20
GWEN - the domestic that subservient - 

02:53:20
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:53:20
GWEN - to, to I don't know whatever is the dominant force in their lives. 

02:53:30
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:53:30
GWEN As far as it's, it's when most confident people I have known now that I have got now you know. 

02:53:35
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

02:53:40
GWEN Are, are and, and women are also lucky in fact that they can express, express their emotions more openly. 

02:53:50
DAVID NYLUND Right, right. So as, as you're transitioning... 

02:53:50
GWEN Uh-huh. 

02:53:55
DAVID NYLUND Uhm, you know, there has been physical transition to your, you're on hormones for about two months now. 

02:54:00
GWEN Yeah. 

02:54:00
DAVID NYLUND It seems like as significantly or more significantly as you're the transition of your identity kind of migration of identity that transition. Okay. 

02:54:10
GWEN Yeah, yeah, like, yeah, the biggest changes were in the first six months. 

02:54:15
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, before... 

02:54:15
GWEN The biggest changes actually happened before I even started dressing. 

02:54:20
DAVID NYLUND Right, right, I think that is significant because sometime right the, the misinformation of, of somebody who's transgender, the whole real life experience around that it means dressing, dressing as a women... 

02:54:35
GWEN Yeah. 

02:54:35
DAVID NYLUND So... 

02:54:35
GWEN But no, what is that... 

02:54:35
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:54:40
GWEN When I'm, when I'm, when I'm at home mopping the floor, doing the dishes, or whatever it is I'm doing and I'm supposed to be doing that in the dress in an apron or can I just wear my sweatpants that I, now are gonna work to get dirty you know. 

02:54:55
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:54:55
GWEN The 24, seven ideas like... 

02:55:00
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:55:00
GWEN Is, is, it, it like is part of the system that's when you, you transition from male - 

02:55:10
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:55:10
GWEN - male to female or female to male in, in, in other cases. 

02:55:15
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:55:15
GWEN And as much as that recognizes that a human being can change. It, it also says well you would have to accept the suicidal norms. 

02:55:30
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:55:30
GWEN - of that gender. 

02:55:35
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:55:35
GWEN When, when it, it seems asinine to me that we, we, we are living in a time when women are overcoming obstacles in business, and society and politics and sports. And you know men not so much, they, they are still expected to you know stay in their roles, but - 

02:56:00
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:56:00
GWEN - but, it, it seems kind of like an insult. 

02:56:05
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:56:05
GWEN That I have to accept the June Cleaver aspects in. 

02:56:10
DAVID NYLUND Right, right it seems like the real life experience of whole standard of care in terms of, uhm - 

02:56:15
GWEN Yeah. 

02:56:20
DAVID NYLUND - meeting the eligibility right in this criteria. It, it seems informed often by these traditional gender norms. 

02:56:25
GWEN Yeah. 

02:56:25
DAVID NYLUND And you've, you've exposed that and, and it seems and correct me if I'm wrong, if some people in the group, uhm, have accepted those who have been seduced by those terms more and your - 

02:56:40
GWEN Yeah. 

02:56:40
DAVID NYLUND - and your, your, you're not fitting in there because you're noticing gender straight-jackets of masculinity. And correct me if I'm wrong, you're noticing the gender straight-jackets of femininity too. 

02:56:55
GWEN Well, it's, it's I, I don't see it as gender straight-jacket. It is a straight jacket that humanity is supposed on. 

02:57:05
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, yeah. 

02:57:05
GWEN Why, why do men have to like sever themselves from aspects of their humanity and why do women have to sever themselves from the aspects of their humanity just so we can fit in to this whole civilization - 

02:57:20
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:57:20
GWEN - that's you know, geared to (inaudible ) reducing people to basic elements... 

02:57:27
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:57:30
GWEN So that they can work within the machinery of civilization is - 

02:57:35
DAVID NYLUND - like that if you is that several though as you know, your civilization. 

02:57:35
GWEN Well. 

02:57:35
DAVID NYLUND So you know you're talking early about that in between space. 

02:57:40
GWEN Yeah. 

02:57:40
DAVID NYLUND Is, is that in between space, is that, uhm, is there something about that, that should be celebrated. 

02:57:50
GWEN Definitely, you know - 

02:57:50
DAVID NYLUND As opposed to... 

02:57:50
GWEN - I, I think not so much physically I do want to complete - 

02:57:55
DAVID NYLUND Right, right. 

02:57:55
GWEN - the transition physically. But I think, ah, emotionally and intellectually the in between spaces just so fringe because it, I can, it's like a step back from, from. It's like looking at two cities from the countryside. I can see you know, I can see the boundaries. I can see... 

02:58:25
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:58:25
GWEN So much more as I'm in transition and, and it's really I mean like I, I just said it really opens your eyes to what it is to be human. 

02:58:35
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

02:58:40
GWEN - more than, more than, more than being a boy, being a girl. 

02:58:40
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:58:40
GWEN - being, being femme being butch - 

02:58:45
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:58:45
GWEN - or anything like that. 

02:58:50
DAVID NYLUND I, I think that's important there is this discourse of idea that, uhm, male to female, female to male that it's, it's just reproducing. 

02:59:00
GWEN Uh-huh. 

02:59:00
DAVID NYLUND A binary and yet. I'm hearing that you these in between spaces. You're transitioning physically and yet it isn't such either or that you can be in that in between space and look back and see the straight jackets of gender. 

02:59:20
GWEN Yeah, well humans aren't bad - 

02:59:20
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:59:20
GWEN - they were the definition of analogs so... 

02:59:20
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, yeah. 

02:59:25
GWEN Why, why are you expect to do accept a binary - 

02:59:30
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

02:59:30
GWEN - socially geared system - 

02:59:30
DAVID NYLUND Right. Do you know, have you thought step backing. What you think it says about you that you've been able to kind of defy these gender norms and look critically at? 

02:59:45
GWEN Ah, the same thing it says about the circle of friends I choose and all that. 

02:59:45
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:59:50
GWEN - like I said, I'm always gravitated to, to outsiders. 

02:59:55
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

02:59:55
GWEN So, I'm not so transfixed on oh! These are the rules of your society. Oh! Well you know piss off. 

03:00:05
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:00:05
GWEN Uh-huh. I, I don't accept the you know, I don't accept limitations being placed on me just to make - 

03:00:10
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:00:15
GWEN - small minded people. 

03:00:15
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:00:15
GWEN - feel comfortable. Small-minded people shouldn't feel comfortable. They should feel afraid about the vastness of the world that surrounds them, you know - 

03:00:25
DAVID NYLUND Wow! That was good. 

03:00:25
GWEN Uhm, well don't thank me, thank (inaudible ). Uhm, but you know it is, that's what I judge is like since I, since I come from a bunch of outsiders when I started talking to them about this it was like oh! Well, yeah, there is, there is that aspect and there is this aspect, but it doesn't mean you got accept like any, any particular one over the other. 

03:01:00
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:01:00
GWEN You can exhibit, accept both or accept whatever you like out of it is. 

03:01:05
DAVID NYLUND - of both end. 

03:01:05
GWEN Yeah, it's kind of like, uhm, ah, an emotional salad bar I can take. 

03:01:10
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

03:01:10
GWEN I, I can take compassion and I can take you know, sarcasm - 

03:01:15
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:01:20
GWEN - and I could, I could keep those in my personality just as. 

03:01:20
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh, you're bit know about. 

03:01:25
GWEN Just the same. 

03:01:25
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:01:25
GWEN Yeah. 

03:01:25
DAVID NYLUND And your, your outsider, your friend, your outsider friends have helped that long as your history of that. And it, it also seems that, that outsider rebel in the past he was more just defied to justify. 

03:01:40
GWEN Yeah, like I knew, I knew what was going on. 

03:01:45
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:01:45
GWEN As much as much as today 20 years ago, when I was in high school. 

03:01:50
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:01:50
GWEN And that's when I kind of, ah, gravitated towards the back in those days they were called rockers you know. 

03:02:00
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:02:00
GWEN They were the druggies. They have long hair. They were the most outside the norm people... 

03:02:05
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:02:05
GWEN You could have, so I, I gravitated towards them because no one, no one really questioned them socially that they did not associate with them. Ah, they were basically you know the school prayers, but they were a group of prayers. So I could feel like I was, I kind of belong and at the same time I can, I could not be confronted. 

03:02:30
DAVID NYLUND Okay. There is a sense of belonging and there is parts of it that were not informed by self-respect as much. 

03:02:40
GWEN Exactly, exactly. 

03:02:40
DAVID NYLUND And now your, your, your rebelliousness or gender outlaw that's a word you know I don't know if that fits for you but I read a book of that. What do you think of that word? 

03:02:50
GWEN Gender outlaw yeah, yeah, if we, if we to mean it in the definition of there are laws one follows and - 

03:03:00
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:03:00
GWEN - laws one doesn't have to follow - 

03:03:05
DAVID NYLUND Right, right. 

03:03:05
GWEN - it's not like a criminal or anything like that. 

03:03:05
DAVID NYLUND Right, right. So that, that you know outside the norm, defining the norms, now it's more coming it's helping to embrace your self-respect and - 

03:03:15
GWEN Uh-huh, definitely. Uhm, uhm, you know exactly embracing self-respect in all, all the aspects of myself. 

03:03:30
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh, okay. 

03:03:30
GWEN I mean not just, not just forcing my perspective to... 

03:03:35
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:03:35
GWEN You know, reflect one aspect. 

03:03:35
DAVID NYLUND Right, right. 

03:03:40
GWEN I can accept my vanity and I can accept my... 

03:03:40
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:03:40
GWEN You know, I can also accept in the, in the same day you know my compassion for my friends. They both exists and they are not mutually. 

03:03:55
DAVID NYLUND It's definitely freeing. I can, I've sensed that freedom when I work together in it. Uhm, I don't know if you thought about have you reflected upon our work together how it's impacted me in terms of my rethinking of, of gender. 

03:04:10
GWEN Well, all I can tell you is what I've observed you know. 

03:04:15
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:04:15
GWEN I, I do notice that you usually seize upon the ideas that, that I put forth like, uhm - 

03:04:25
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:04:25
GWEN - like, uhm, the fact that I, I don't have to accept certain you know as I referred to it be 1950's - 

03:04:35
DAVID NYLUND Right, right. 

03:04:35
GWEN - June Cleaver aspects of, of femininity as. I, I, I see sometimes you know, I say something and it clicks, clicks a few and... 

03:04:45
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, so its-- I'm glad you see that because, uhm, you know I-- I'm inducted to the gender system. I'm, I'm cisgender. I've lot of privilege. 

03:05:00
GWEN Uh-huh. 

03:05:00
DAVID NYLUND Uhm, I like to challenge norms, but I also benefit from you know. 

03:05:05
GWEN Oh! Well... 

03:05:05
DAVID NYLUND I situated more in, in what the society sees as the norm. 

03:05:10
GWEN Yeah. 

03:05:10
DAVID NYLUND And I've done a lot of work in gender, but more in many ways more of a gender scholar and gender therapist. But it has helped me to, to move the theory into practice. I don't if you notice as much but you see, you see that I. 

03:05:25
GWEN Yeah. 

03:05:25
DAVID NYLUND I'm able to impact that so have you thought about how your ways of being may impact others in the trans community where they might think a little differently or, or move in. 

03:05:35
GWEN Well that's, that's why I'm kind of trying to bring myself into the group more. 

03:05:40
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:05:40
GWEN Again, I, I pulled back because I was tired of that narrative. Now, now I, I want to kind of come to group so that you know I can keep on repeating my narrative. 

03:05:55
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:05:55
GWEN And see if you know I mean you know add that to the salad bar of our ideas out there. 

03:06:00
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:06:00
GWEN So that you know someone who, who keeps on hearing you know like, I, I got a, I got suppress - 

03:06:10
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:06:10
GWEN - kind of suppress my nose, someone, someone can act to-- actually hear that you know. 

03:06:15
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:06:15
GWEN If you just accept it, it makes transitioning so much easier. 

03:06:20
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:06:25
GWEN Ah, if you don't, if you don't fight with yourself all the time and does accept all, all aspects of you being, uhm, transitioning to whatever you want to become, ah, I mean it, it works in education. 

03:06:45
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:06:45
GWEN It works in you know I mean, if you don't constantly fight with yourself intellectually and spiritually and emotionally, uhm, you can use that energy to achieve whatever goal you want. 

03:06:55
DAVID NYLUND So, so these are something that you might say to the group when they bring up those comments, so. 

03:07:05
GWEN Yeah, I, ah, I, I unfortunately one, one of the girls who voiced the most women - 

03:07:15
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:07:15
GWEN - view points, I haven't see her since I've gotten back but she was, she was one to where she, she even wrote a poem where she wants her male self to die it's... 

03:07:25
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:07:25
GWEN That, that, that aspect of self-hate that people make you know - 

03:07:35
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:07:35
GWEN - that people will take on in, in a reaction. I, I see why they do it. 

03:07:40
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:07:40
GWEN They do it so that to kind of give them an impetus to repulse. 

03:07:45
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:07:45
GWEN To use the pushing away of the male self - 

03:07:50
DAVID NYLUND Sure, sure. 

03:07:50
GWEN - as means of proportion to where they want to get to. 

03:07:50
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:07:55
GWEN But, uhm, I'm-- it is just very disturbing to me to hear you know you actually want an aspect of your history of your personality - 

03:08:05
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:08:05
GWEN - to fade into death, which is impossible if you are still alive. 

03:08:10
DAVID NYLUND Sure even if you tried right. 

03:08:10
GWEN You know, yeah, is in, yeah, even if you tried I mean there is no, there is no getting rid of your history. There is no putting down who all the experiences you recruit as a human being - 

03:08:25
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:08:25
GWEN - from, from, uhm, the point of birth till now. There is to, to try and - 

03:08:30
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:08:30
GWEN - to try and, ah, wish that into, into non-existences ultimately self-defeating - 

03:08:40
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:08:40
GWEN - and hurtful. 

03:08:45
DAVID NYLUND You know, I was thinking, uhm, as you were talking about something about the group members, say particularly this group member that instead of her old self or male self-dying. You know, what, what might be like if our gender system died rather than - 

03:09:05
GWEN Yeah. 

03:09:05
DAVID NYLUND - is that? 

03:09:05
GWEN Yeah, what would it be like if we can finally be just human. 

03:09:10
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:09:15
GWEN That's you know, that's, uhm, that's what it keeps eye on coming back to me, it is, uhm, why can't we just - 

03:09:20
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:09:20
GWEN - be the human animals that we are. Why can't we have apply all, all the tools - 

03:09:30
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, yeah. 

03:09:30
GWEN - that we have intellectually, emotionally, ah, spiritually to just being as, as good as we can be at who you are. 

03:09:40
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, I think it's, it's that complexity that you are living out and, and embracing. I get a sense that is difficult in that group, but it is also difficult for, for my colleagues often who work - 

03:09:55
GWEN Well. 

03:09:55
DAVID NYLUND - with transgender peoples the complexity that you know these qualities are human qualities not gender qualities and, and you want to a transition. 

03:10:10
GWEN Yeah. 

03:10:10
DAVID NYLUND Uhm, you know, as a female... 

03:10:10
GWEN Uh-huh. 

03:10:15
DAVID NYLUND And as Gwen there is not either or but both end. 

03:10:15
GWEN Yeah. 

03:10:15
DAVID NYLUND It's hard for people to kind of get that it seems. 

03:10:20
GWEN Uhm, it, it is tough question. 

03:10:20
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:10:25
GWEN I mean it's, it's amazing side my own self as well I mean, I, I had to basically you know think, think these things required a lot on myself. 

03:10:35
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:10:35
GWEN I mean, uhm, people think you wake up one day and you wanna transition know what it is as you is or for me, my, my personal journey was you know 36 years of constantly fighting with myself. 

03:10:50
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:10:55
GWEN And one day just saying you know I, I can't do it anymore. 

03:11:00
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:11:00
GWEN I can't, I can't live my whole life fighting myself. 

03:11:05
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:11:05
GWEN It's-- and it's unfair for anyone to expect, ah, a person to do that just so you, you can make other people feel comfortable around you. 

03:11:15
DAVID NYLUND Right, right. 

03:11:15
GWEN It's, it's the height of selfishness to ask individuals to do that. 

03:11:25
DAVID NYLUND That, that was significant turning point and of, of as you've transition having noticed within the transgender community its own kind of sets of rules and norms. 

03:11:40
GWEN Uhm, yeah, the... 

03:11:40
DAVID NYLUND That you have to measure up to certain we've talked about kind of already. 

03:11:45
GWEN Well in, in every group you have the hierarchy. 

03:11:50
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:11:50
GWEN You know, Victoria prince was it, she-- when she set up her, her group of, uhm, basically her cross dressing it was like. 

03:12:05
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:12:05
GWEN She set up you know, to where it was heterosexual cross dressing men only. No transgender or anything like that, no, no so and there is always you know people who seek to excludes certain classifications like, uhm, within the transgender community you have you know, uhm, intersexed, which are you know, people born with these differences. 

03:12:40
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:12:40
GWEN And then you have you know I, I, I guess what, what I'd be called ultimately once I complete the procedures transexed that I, I, I don't define myself in any particular term. 

03:13:00
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:13:00
GWEN But yeah, there is always a question what are you, are you transexed? 

03:13:05
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:13:05
GWEN - are you transgender or you, you know... 

03:13:10
DAVID NYLUND How do you, how do you navigate that. 

03:13:10
GWEN I, I, I, I just basically I, I, I, I laugh it off and just say well - 

03:13:15
DAVID NYLUND Okay. 

03:13:15
GWEN - I have to give a whole sentence to I can't sum it up in a word. 

03:13:20
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:13:20
GWEN I-- you know, uhm, and you know who are you? 

03:13:25
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:13:30
GWEN Tell me you know, define yourself in a one word. 

03:13:35
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, yeah. 

03:13:35
GWEN You know, boy only-- you know boy or yourself down to - 

03:13:35
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:13:40
GWEN - feel so much. 

03:13:40
DAVID NYLUND Do, do you feel some of that let's say in a group and some other circles that you now, uhm, are part of that, uhm, define themselves mainly through their, their trans identity and the idea of, of their, ah, physical transition like the goal is sex reassignment surgery. 

03:14:05
GWEN Yeah. 

03:14:05
DAVID NYLUND And that's the because that's, that's your goal. 

03:14:05
GWEN That's my goal. 

03:14:05
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:14:05
GWEN And I have to give that because I'm not comfortable with saying. 

03:14:10
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:14:10
GWEN I'm transgender. What is that's basically saying I'm an action. 

03:14:15
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:14:20
GWEN Basically that's how I view it in the process of transgender is. You know going from you know one gender to another but ultimately when I, when I complete this journey am I always gonna have to say I'm transgender. At that point my goal is to become a women. 

03:14:35
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:14:40
GWEN Not, not constantly live in transition you know. 

03:14:45
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:14:45
GWEN Uhm, just, just to kind of (inaudible ) my who-- self-- whole myself and give everyone a convenient label, so that - 

03:14:50
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:14:50
GWEN - I can be followed away in the intellectual role it is. 

03:14:55
DAVID NYLUND Right, so you're, you're aware that once, once you have the sex reassignment surgery that's not an endpoint. 

03:15:05
GWEN Oh! Yeah. 

03:15:05
DAVID NYLUND Okay, okay. 

03:15:10
GWEN Uhm, ah, right now I, I see it as the, the biggest goal in my life. 

03:15:15
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:15:20
GWEN And I, I-- but I'm very well aware that the nature of life is that you know you never close the book and the credits never roll when, when you achieve something. You now you go to sleep that night and you wake up and you gotta a whole another life you have to live in that day you know. 

03:15:40
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:15:40
GWEN So it is I, I have in fact the I have a very close friend who went through, went through the transition at lightning speed within a year. 

03:15:55
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh, yeah. 

03:16:00
GWEN And you know she, she had a lot to, lot to adapt to a lot-- a lot of changes she had to make. 

03:16:05
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:16:05
GWEN And after the transition she still you know, she still you know adapting and learning. 

03:16:10
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:16:15
GWEN So is... 

03:16:15
DAVID NYLUND So that's helpful. 

03:16:15
GWEN You never really stop. 

03:16:15
DAVID NYLUND Right, right. 

03:16:20
GWEN You know. 

03:16:20
DAVID NYLUND So imagine you are at that, that place and it's not an endpoint. You know you have had the surgery that fit yourself. What is that future Gwen , what advice is that future Gwen have for you now? 

03:16:30
GWEN Uhm, well, ah, extrapolate where I might be in the future and, and advise me now, uhm... 

03:16:40
DAVID NYLUND Is there any particular advice that might be useful for you as you where you're now where you are going to between now and then. 

03:16:50
GWEN Just to get rid of expectations, you know. 

03:16:55
DAVID NYLUND That's a huge one. 

03:16:55
GWEN Yeah. 

03:17:00
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:17:00
GWEN Exactly. 

03:17:00
DAVID NYLUND Because you notice all those expectations. 

03:17:00
GWEN Yeah. 

03:17:00
DAVID NYLUND Until those expectations are met. 

03:17:05
GWEN Yeah. 

03:17:05
DAVID NYLUND That person is not a complete being. 

03:17:05
GWEN Precisely. 

03:17:10
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:17:10
GWEN Precisely, I mean expect the unexpected I guess is the cliché that, that could, could be best used. 

03:17:20
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:17:20
GWEN I mean and the expectations also limit your - 

03:17:20
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:17:20
GWEN - it limit like where you can't add up be open to what's going, going on around you. 

03:17:30
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:17:30
GWEN I mean if I, if I hadn't been open I could, could have never come to that point... 

03:17:40
DAVID NYLUND Right. right. 

03:17:40
GWEN Hey this, this whole idea of you know accepting one gender role. 

03:17:45
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:17:45
GWEN you know is, is asinine to me. 

03:17:50
DAVID NYLUND Sure. 

03:17:50
GWEN You know if I, if I just kept within if I just kept the blinders on and kept walking for. I would be, I would not have come to the revelations that helped me. 

03:18:00
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:18:00
GWEN Get through the day today. 

03:18:05
DAVID NYLUND Right. So not letting expectations govern you as much. 

03:18:10
GWEN Uh-huh. 

03:18:10
DAVID NYLUND And as you continue to do that what possibility do you see to yourself moving towards? 

03:18:15
GWEN Uhm, basically, ah, the rules to my (inaudible ) as far as. 

03:18:23
DAVID NYLUND Okay. Yeah. 

03:18:25
GWEN You know, ah, if I, if I, I, I would pretty much know that if I want something, if I wanna change something in myself, which is the thing people dread - 

03:18:35
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, yeah. 

03:18:35
GWEN - more than anything else, oh! I don't want to. 

03:18:40
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:18:40
GWEN I don't wanna do that, that means I'm gonna have to. I can, I've already made so many changes why not change it. 

03:18:45
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, right. 

03:18:45
GWEN No I did not change the goal, why not change you know. Why not change my career why not? 

03:18:50
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:18:55
GWEN You know anything, I don't have to fear change in my life - 

03:19:00
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:19:00
GWEN - so much as. 

03:19:00
DAVID NYLUND The world is your oyster in you know in kind of summing here, summing up here. 

03:19:05
GWEN Uhm. 

03:19:05
DAVID NYLUND Could that all you are that old Nick that parts that of Nick that you want to have less of your relationship with, with that old Nick be surprised or flabbergasted that you've now seeing the world is your oyster. 

03:19:20
GWEN Oh! Yeah, the my, my former emotional space was but that, uhm, I, I had to limit myself. 

03:19:35
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:19:35
GWEN - to you know like I said, a kinetics series of events to get back - 

03:19:40
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:19:40
GWEN - to sleep. 

03:19:40
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:19:45
GWEN Uhm, just like in get through the life without you know radically embracing myself by, by admitting to the world that I actually wanna be a women even though I was born a man. 

03:19:55
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:20:00
GWEN Uhm, so... 

03:20:00
DAVID NYLUND World is your oyster that's some you couldn't imagine that now, now it's possible so. 

03:20:05
GWEN No I, I, I had to - 

03:20:10
DAVID NYLUND Okay. 

03:20:10
GWEN - think of myself as completely limited. 

03:20:10
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. Okay, I guess we got to end here, but I don't know this I'm going to investigate this, ah, after this meeting because I don't anything. I know oysters because (inaudible ) but, are oysters gendered? 

03:20:25
GWEN I have no idea. I'm just repeating... 

03:20:30
DAVID NYLUND Okay so maybe, maybe oyster is a model for living outside of gendered way of being able to sum I'm gonna go on wikipedia as soon as this is over so... 

03:20:35
GWEN No, no I'm going to have to. 

03:20:40
DAVID NYLUND Okay, let's do it together, thank you. 

03:20:40
GWEN Okay. 

03:20:45
JULIE TILSEN Sort of how this is structured then, is, uhm, you know, I just had an opportunity to be a witness to your conversation, and in sharing a few thoughts of reflections rather than engaging in what we often do socially, where this is back and forth and were thinking about, what we are going to say while we are supposed to be listening, I had the benefit of having this conversational space to just listen and now I am going to share something that struck me, and you guys will have a conversational space to just listen and then - 

03:21:15
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:21:20
JULIE TILSEN - see if, see if there is something you want to comment on - 

03:21:20
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:21:20
GWEN Yeah. 

03:21:20
JULIE TILSEN - right that makes sense? 

03:21:25
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, it does. 

03:21:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, okay, I have got just a few things it sort of touched me or struck me that I will throw out there in a couple of questions, uhm, and that occurred to me, uhm, and they are not necessarily things that you have to respond to right now, or answer, uhm, or they could be, and it is just a possibilities... 

03:21:45
GWEN Oh, pretty much in open books that - 

03:21:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

03:21:50
GWEN - don't worry about me. 

03:21:50
JULIE TILSEN Okay. Yeah, I just, just away to extend that and too got to build on something one of the things that stood out from me Gwen that, that you were talking is about, uhm, his idea that there is something in your circle of friends that helped you come in to yourself or find yourself and I think that one of the thinking that, some of the thinking that Dave and I have in, uhm, uhm, taking our practices from different kinds of postmodern, ah, therapies is this idea of extending the conversation and so that's - 

03:22:20
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:22:25
JULIE TILSEN - would you add anything, do you want to say in terms of what would you were doing here with us. 

03:22:30
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, I-- what I am sensing is that you are, uhm, the, ah, self that you're here becoming, it is always in relationship in the community - 

03:22:40
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

03:22:40
DAVID NYLUND - and in order to, I think in order to defy, and we resist some of those culture imperatives, we talk about the genders system that - 

03:22:45
GWEN Uh-huh. 

03:22:45
DAVID NYLUND - you know, its hard to do it alone, it's good to do it with people who support you in, in your own weirdness - 

03:22:55
GWEN Yeah. 

03:23:00
DAVID NYLUND - I mean on a good way. 

03:23:00
GWEN Well, ah, you-- I, I - 

03:23:00
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

03:23:00
GWEN - I understand. I don't take the negative kind of connotations - 

03:23:05
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

03:23:05
GWEN - I personally like being heard. 

03:23:05
DAVID NYLUND Okay. 

03:23:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

03:23:05
GWEN Ah, so... 

03:23:10
DAVID NYLUND - which is in transit, which helps to counter the larger group, and also the group that you are in conversation with sometimes they can get recruited into that sort, that those friends hold you, help you. 

03:23:25
GWEN Yeah. 

03:23:25
JULIE TILSEN And, and so bringing it back to what we were doing here, what I have trying to say is that in my having an opportunity witness the conversation that you guys just had, I feel like there is a way I was brought in conversationally to that circle and I want to, uhm, respond into with similar things, that struck me - 

03:23:45
GWEN Okay. 

03:23:45
JULIE TILSEN - and, and I think at that is embracing a weirdness culturally, uhm, in a sense that were constantly creating those connections, that you are talking about in those circles and finding ourselves though a relationship with the others. 

03:24:00
GWEN Yeah. 

03:24:00
JULIE TILSEN So so that's what our thoughts are about, uhm, having, uhm, perhaps appendix to your conversation, not that it didn't stand on its own but that it invited more, hopefully more possibilities here. 

03:24:15
GWEN Okay, excellent. 

03:24:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. So, I, I just have this enormous appreciation, uhm, for Nick, ah, for enduring what he did, ah, for that time, uhm, and keeping you alive, well enough, ah, despite, uhm, the systems efforts to kill you slowly through, uhm, cigarette smoking and a, a, a, un-- unhealthy amount of weight as you experience that, uhm, that Nick, Nick did something to keep you alive long enough and well enough so that I am having this opportunity to meet Gwen, uhm, and, uhm, it's just got me thinking about who, who I am, and who I have been, and who I want to be, and is there, uhm, perhaps a protector, or a champion, or someone I have lost side of that I need to-- I want to call up again and take along with me, uhm - 

03:25:20
DAVID NYLUND Uhm. 

03:25:20
JULIE TILSEN - so that, uhm, I can continue to extent my life and, and step into, who, who I want to continue to be, so, so, thank you and Nick for partnering on that, uhm, the couple of the other things, that struck me apparently I just kinda, two or three my notes, there is a lot in that conversation, I took a lot of notes, uhm, uhm, you know this idea about, he said, Gwen said, uhm, you know you are making connections with yourself through, through finding understanding of others as you came into that and I just got me wondering about is it even possible for us to connect with our identities and who we are outside of being in relationship with others and outside of understanding, so she is got me thinking about this bigger idea of the role relationships play and how we construct our identities, uhm, that can we even have an identity in our self, outside of relationship... 

03:26:25
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. UH-huh. 

03:26:25
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, uhm, and then thinking more about Nick, ah, I would-- this question stood out for me, uhm, yeah, just wondering how would you Gwen envision a future, that you're presently creating, uhm, in which you continue to make the most out of the past that involved Nick you know, in what ways do you carry Nick forward with you. Uhm, and another thing that I kept kinda rowing around, uhm, and then I struck with Gwen you guys were talking about this idea of confidence, and I think they had asked, asked you Gwen about, uhm, the role of this confidence, and, and these things and, and I was thinking about courage and I was thinking how confidence and courage were often coded as masculine, and those were the domains of men, and I am-- and, uhm, I have-- I just started thinking well you know, I wonder what it says - 

03:27:30
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:27:30
JULIE TILSEN - you know what kind, what it has taken, he has taken a kind of a manly courage to challenge the conventions of manhood, and that if there is a way and, and - 

03:27:40
DAVID NYLUND Uhm. 

03:27:40
JULIE TILSEN - coming into being the woman that you wanted to be - 

03:27:40
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:27:40
GWEN Yeah. Yeah. 

03:27:40
JULIE TILSEN - you are actually a better man, for that... 

03:27:45
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:27:45
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, and... 

03:27:55
GWEN You better say. 

03:27:55
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:27:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, okay, and then I think I am what are that, what are if I had this around, uhm, one of things that Dave was talking at the end was referencing a gender outlaw, Kate Bornstein and, uhm, you know, I found myself really, really wanted to dig my hills and in, in thinking, uhm, because, because Gwen is a good citizen well you know okay, if you mean like not breaking laws like a criminal, but I am thinking you know, uhm, don't we often go by his law abiding citizens without question, if these laws are even just, and that it's not about being, uhm, a, a criminal as an individual, but that we're, we're living under, uhm, a system of unjust laws and - 

03:28:40
DAVID NYLUND Uhm. 

03:28:40
JULIE TILSEN - and what is expected to - 

03:28:40
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:28:45
JULIE TILSEN - abide by them, and that - 

03:28:45
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:28:45
JULIE TILSEN - uhm, uhm, this confidence encourages actually being deployed to take down, or expose an unjust - 

03:28:55
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

03:28:55
JULIE TILSEN - system of the gender laws - 

03:28:55
GWEN Oh, yeah. 

03:28:55
JULIE TILSEN - uhm, so those are some things with that, that, that really struck me, uhm - 

03:29:00
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:29:00
JULIE TILSEN - and again I am-- I am going, going home with the-- well, if I may borrowing Nick and, and to help coach along my own champion that I think I could use at times, uhm, so then, a kind of, ah, I mean in another set of thoughts or ideas I am having it sort of about the conversation itself, not just like the stuff of it that struck me, uhm, Dave I was wondering about and I would be curious, if you guys had a, a, may be an answer to this, or response to this, uhm, Dave you were asking her about her experience of your experience - 

03:29:40
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:29:40
JULIE TILSEN - and what, what she knows when Gwen noticed, uhm, may be you are taking during the of course of the years or you guys have been working together, and, uhm, maybe I want to ask Gwen first, what, what would-- what was that like for you, uhm, Dave asking you about your experience of his experience of your work together. 

03:30:05
GWEN Well, it was kinda, kinda of a complex because doing this for me is, I have to embrace a lot of selfishness, you know, ah - 

03:30:15
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

03:30:15
GWEN - a kind of a self is him, ah, I guess, aren't around would put it, even though she was a lanker. Ah, but, uhm, but so, I had to kind of step back, to step back and you know kind of think about, what I observed in, in regards to how he may have adapted over, over the past year - 

03:30:40
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

03:30:40
GWEN - I have to, what I pulled out there. 

03:30:45
JULIE TILSEN Okay. So you have seen some of the adapting and, and, and what way if, if David hadn't stepped into some adaptations and perhaps transition, he is, he is transition from one kind of therapist for you into another kind. Yeah. 

03:30:55
GWEN Ah, yeah. 

03:30:55
JULIE TILSEN If you hadn't and able to do that, do you suppose, you'd be having experiences in the conversation you're having or, or taking the conversations outside with you the way is it had been meaningful. 

03:31:10
GWEN If, it wasn't so you know, conversational and adaptive - 

03:31:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

03:31:10
GWEN - I am sure I have probably, I had probably would have just you know, I like with other, other psychologists, I've had before in my past, I have, I would have not got any value out of it - 

03:31:25
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

03:31:25
GWEN - and eventually moved on. 

03:31:25
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

03:31:25
GWEN And I hope I would have moved on to you, you know. 

03:31:30
JULIE TILSEN Right, you would have fired him? 

03:31:30
GWEN Yeah, oh, yeah. 

03:31:30
JULIE TILSEN Okay, alright. So that the David was willing to step into some adaptation or transition, I was then - 

03:31:40
GWEN Well, he-- in, in his defense, I mean he got it right off the bat... 

03:31:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, okay. Well, we were not-- yeah, okay fantastic. So, so, so that is has been that kind of adaptation or flexibility has been sort of critical to what you guys have done together too okay. And Dave for I'm just curious, uhm, what was your thinking behind that question? 

03:32:00
DAVID NYLUND Uhm. 

03:32:00
JULIE TILSEN Asking Gwen about her experience of this experience. 

03:32:05
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, a couple of things one is the kind of work that Julie and I do work we, uhm, really privileged the people work on their voices, and want to, ah, equalize and make more democratic the conversations. You know you're, you're coming to me the power relations are not equal, right. But I also I think it would be unethical, if I didn't share how the conversation has impacted me, so that's one. 

03:32:30
JULIE TILSEN Hmm-hmm. 

03:32:30
DAVID NYLUND And then secondly, I think and as important or more importantly is there is this idea that, ah, the persons who is transitioning is a transgender person. And it kind of assumes that the non-transgender or cisgender person is fixed and, and I think that reinforces like this is gender person is normal. Right and at the center so, uhm, I think that, uhm, a cisgender person is always, is also transitioning. And that they one needs to notice their own transition, if not, one could reproduce the problematic gender relations of our culture. So, I think it is a requirement ethical for the, the non-transgender, cisgender therapist to notice again their own gender transition that, it's not just. 

03:33:20
GWEN I think that's helpful to you keep, ah, the therapist from seeing themselves as static, at the gate between because for, for lot of transgenders we, we have to seek out therapy is one of the requirements. 

03:33:40
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:33:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

03:33:40
GWEN For it so - 

03:33:40
JULIE TILSEN Hmm-hmm. 

03:33:45
GWEN - if, if you go and come to someone who is, ah, doesn't see, doesn't see themselves as the changing individually, they send to-- they tend to set up a eye on the sentinel at the gate position. 

03:34:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

03:34:00
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, it's a good point. 

03:34:00
JULIE TILSEN As you're talking I'm also thinking that, that's also way to underscore that it's not just trans folks or gender-queer folks, uhm, that, uhm, live under at the gender binary, that cis folks, do as well. And as such we have an opportunity to benefit from exposing it and we also because of our privilege have a responsibility to help expose it here down and hence and you're saying that, that's the one way to do it. 

03:34:30
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:34:30
JULIE TILSEN Particularly in a sort of doubly privileged position as a cis-gender therapist person or expert you know person in authority. 

03:34:40
DAVID NYLUND Definitely. 

03:34:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, okay, cool, alright. Uhm, so I don't if, if there is any other kind of responses to some of the other things that I had said. Uhm, anything else you wanted to do with - 

03:34:55
DAVID NYLUND Uh-huh. 

03:34:55
JULIE TILSEN - uhm, this component of the conversation? 

03:35:00
GWEN Uhm, let see you like, ah, you mentioned something that I, I found interesting of back of couple of pages, ah - 

03:35:10
JULIE TILSEN Oh - 

03:35:10
GWEN - let's see. 

03:35:10
JULIE TILSEN - of my, my admirations of Nick. 

03:35:10
GWEN Oh, yeah. 

03:35:10
JULIE TILSEN How it kept you alive in this idea of a - 

03:35:15
GWEN Yeah. 

03:35:15
JULIE TILSEN - find yourself your understanding in relationship. 

03:35:20
GWEN That will-- that will that's-- something I've widely want to any observer to come away with this, ah, you know, uhm, I don't have the, the I guess hatred - 

03:35:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

03:35:35
GWEN - of, of Nick that most, most people would you know, ah, most people, who transition who want to hold on to that - 

03:35:45
JULIE TILSEN Hmm-hmm. 

03:35:45
GWEN - it's I mean, uhm, it you know, Nick is the one who got me through - 

03:35:55
JULIE TILSEN Yes, yes. 

03:35:55
GWEN - through sort of life, to a point, where I can finally accept myself and so. 

03:36:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, and, and, and acknowledging that and honoring him through your appreciation and would you say that's a further way of challenging some of those sort of norms that get - 

03:36:10
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:36:10
JULIE TILSEN - pretty in the trans community as well. 

03:36:10
DAVID NYLUND Right, right. 

03:36:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, so it's a double honoring of Nick to embrace and then stand by it. 

03:36:15
GWEN Yeah, definitely. 

03:36:15
DAVID NYLUND I, I think along with that, that the therapist could give, could reinforce - 

03:36:25
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

03:36:25
DAVID NYLUND - the idea that therapy progress means, you know letting go - 

03:36:30
GWEN Conversely, if - 

03:36:30
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

03:36:30
GWEN - if it came from the other, if a therapist did not have the correct respective, they could see my, my defending my honoring in and cherishing, of Nick is somehow, Ah! you're not in the norm - 

03:36:50
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

03:36:50
GWEN - of a transgender. You must be, you must not be a transgender? 

03:36:55
JULIE TILSEN It could, it could possible risk your efforts at getting surgery perhaps. 

03:37:00
DAVID NYLUND Right, right under the right of... 

03:37:05
JULIE TILSEN Under a certain gazes, some people in terms of operating as a gatekeeper might, yeah, uhm, so, it can be risky that way. 

03:37:10
GWEN So I, I... 

03:37:10
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

03:37:10
GWEN Yeah. 

03:37:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, okay, yeah, well and you, you got into kind of my with my last question was a hoping to put a nice period on this was, you know what would you hope folks watching this, would take away and so that's one of them that. For some folks, uhm, there is this embracing of, uhm, all of who you are, and been and who are you becoming, yeah. 

03:37:40
GWEN Yeah, more or less accept people as an analog as a continuum - 

03:37:45
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

03:37:45
GWEN - rather than - 

03:37:45
JULIE TILSEN - the digital. 

03:37:45
