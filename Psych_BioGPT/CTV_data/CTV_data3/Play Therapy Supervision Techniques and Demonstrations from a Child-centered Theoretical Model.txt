Play Therapy Supervision: Techniques and Demonstrations from a Child-Centered Theoretical Model with Dee C. Ray 

00:00:00
To learn more about the play therapy model Dee discusses in this DVD, please refer to her book "Advanced Play Therapy: Essential Conditions, Knowledge, and Skills for Child Practice" published by Routledge www.routledge.com (212) 216-7800 

00:00:45
DEE RAY Hi, I'm Dee Ray. I'm an associate professor at the University of North Texas. I specialize in the area of play therapy, and today I wanted to talk about supervision in play therapy. And so the goal of a child-centered play therapy supervisor is to provide an environment that facilitates the growth of a play therapist, leading to higher levels of personal congruence necessary for the elevated experience and communication of unconditional positive regard and empathy for children. 

00:01:10
Goal of Play Therapy Supervisor The goal of a Child Centered Play Therapy (CCPT) supervisor is to provide an environment that facilitates the growth of a play therapist leading to higher levels of personal congruence necessary for the elevated experience and communication of unconditional positive regard and empathy for children. 

00:01:15
DEE RAY So the three attitudinal qualities are what we're talking about here as being the focus of supervision and they are empathic understanding, unconditional positive regard, and congruence. 

00:01:25
Play Therapy Supervisor Attitudinal Qualities (Ray, 2011) Ray (2011) stressed the importance of the supervisor's attitudinal qualities toward the supervisee. As supervisees are able to experience these therapeutic attitudinal qualities from their supervisor, the more effective they become at providing these qualities as play therapists. The degree to which the supervisor exhibits each of these qualities during supervision is dependent upon the supervisee's stage of development as a play therapist. 

00:01:25
DEE RAY The more that we can provide these three qualities to our supervisees, the more that they are able to experience them with their own clients and so that's what we're shooting for in play therapy supervision. The other thing is how much you're going to share these three qualities with your supervisee often is dependent on the supervisee's developmental level and that's what we'll be talking about a little bit more today. 

00:01:50
DEE RAY I wanna say a couple more things about each of the qualities. First is an unconditional positive regard. What is that? That is our complete acceptance of the supervisee as a person. That there are things that the supervisee might do, actions that they might take that we might be guiding them on, helping them change, but what never changes is our acceptance of who they are. The second quality of empathic understanding is can we enter the world of our supervisee? Can we understand them? Can we know where they're coming from? Can we see the world from how they see the world? And then the third is congruence, and sometimes the most difficult for us is can we be completely who we are as supervisors as people in the relationship with the supervisee? How much of ourselves do we bring into that supervision relationship and be consistent with what's going on with us internally as we show ourselves externally? 

00:02:45
Play Therapy Supervisor Qualifications: Knowledge, Skills, & Attitudinal Qualities (Ray, 2011) 

00:02:45
DEE RAY So in addition to the attitudinal qualities that each play therapist supervisor needs, there's five more characteristics I would suggest. One is just the basic education in play therapy, um, knowing the theories of play therapy, knowing the skills of play therapy. Uh, the next, the next one would be education on supervision, understanding the models of supervision, understanding developmental growth in supervision. Another one is, as we move into the other three, those are around experiences, and so that would be the supervision of supervision. One of the things that makes a good supervisor is being supervised, and this is something I would suggest for all supervisors. As we enter into this new world of supervising others, we need help with that, we need consultation with that. The other is that having the background in play therapy experience, that you have done play therapy, that you feel comfortable with play therapy, you understand play therapy, and you have a background and breadth and depth of experience to share with your supervisees. And finally, what I would suggest that often kind of goes to the wayside, is ongoing play therapy experience, that you don't have your five to ten years of experience and then you stop and only do supervision or education, but that you continue your own work in play therapy, because I know for me, I still struggle with those things when I'm in the room with a child and it's always nice when I'm in supervision to be able to go immediately back to something that I struggled with. 

00:04:20
DEE RAY When we look at the process of supervision, we wanna look at two major areas of just, and this is across all, um, types of supervision, and that would be looking at really understanding your supervisee, what is their worldview, how do they look at the world, how do they look at people, and how do they look at counseling? 

00:04:35
Process of Supervision Supervision is recognized as a developmental process that involves a conscious matching of supervisor with supervisee based on the supervisee's Level of Experience, Worldview & Perception of Counseling. The general trajectory of the supervision process involves a move for supervisees from an external need for approval and feedback to an internal locus of evaluation involving personal and professional characteristics. 

00:04:35
DEE RAY And we want to try and get into that world, um, as we work with them. And secondly, what I have found to be extremely important in working with supervisees is assessing and matching their developmental level. One of the things that we know about supervision is a very developmental process, and it moves from an external locus of control to an internal locus of control. So the beginning parts of supervision are typically that the supervisee relies on the supervisor, relies on external cues of what's working and what's not. And what we're trying to do in supervision is move to a place where they start to rely on themselves and their own internal evaluation processes. 

00:05:20
DEE RAY So in the next part of this video what we're going to be doing is presenting a child-centered play therapy supervision model that fits not only for child-centered play therapy, but for all play therapy. It starts with a child-centered way of working and then helps facilitate growth in supervisees if they would like to move to another model. So trying to take into account different belief systems, different theoretical backgrounds. 

00:05:40
CCPT Supervision Model 

00:05:40
4 Stages of Developmental Processes 

00:05:45
DEE RAY In the CCPT supervision model there are four stages moving through the typical developmental processes that take place in supervision. 

00:05:50
Expectations of Supervisee in Supervision 

00:05:50
Expectations of Supervisee in Play Therapy Sessions 

00:05:50
Helpful Supervisor Qualities and Attitudes 

00:05:50
Helpful Supervisor Responses 

00:05:50
DEE RAY For each stage, I will describe what can be expected from the supervisee in supervision, what you can expect from the supervisee in the play therapy sessions, and then I'll move into what supervisor qualities and attitudes are most helpful, and additionally, what supervisor responses are most helpful. 

00:06:10
DEE RAY Following each stage description, I will show a video clip of a roleplay demonstrating a supervision session from that stage. You will notice that in all demonstrations, the observation of the actual play therapy session is a key part of supervision. In other words, watching videos, observing videos of play therapy sessions in supervision is a key part of play therapy supervision. All supervisees in this series are advanced counselors who are acting their roles, and the reference to any clients are completely fictional. 

00:06:45
DEE RAY So we're gonna move into stage one of supervision. In this stage, there are certain dynamics that go on in the supervision room, so between the supervisor and the supervisee, and its really determined by what the supervisee comes into supervision with. So typically you can expect, um, certain kinds behaviors from the supervisee in this stage. 

00:07:00
Stage 1: Skill Focused Supervisee Dynamics in Supervision Concrete, rule-bound Seek definitive answers Tendency to generalize specific cases Sensitive to evaluation Seek praise Overly self-critical or overly confident 

00:07:00
DEE RAY They are typically concrete, rule-bound. They tend to seek definitive answers, um, wanting the supervisee to tell them exactly what to do. Um, they also have a tendency to generalize specific cases. Uh, so what that means is that the supervisor will tell them something that they could do with this client, and then they take that information and say, well, I must have to do this with all my clients. And so that's something to be careful of. Um, they are very sensitive to evaluation, uh, which means I am sensitive to that dynamic, that they, um, will very much be looking for praise, seeking praise, and anything that isn't perceived as praise is often perceived as criticism. And, um, they might take the supervisor's comments as super-, as critical, or they are also very self-critical, very critical of, uh, what they're doing in session, of how they're doing. The other, um, the other side of that is you might have a supervisee who's very self-critical, but there are often new supervisees who are overly confident, they kind of move to the other side of the continuum, where they don't need help, they understand everything, um, they know exactly what to do, uh, and so they're overly confident in their skills as a, uh, counselor. 

00:08:20
DEE RAY So that's what the supervisee is like in the session in supervision, and what you can expect is going on in play therapy are like, kind of actions that you would expect from being that anxious, from being, um, wanting to do it the right way. 

00:08:35
Stage 1: Skill Focused Supervisee Dynamics in Play Therapy Rote Responses Lack Affect Inability to match child affect Easily distracted by internal processes Anxious Possible panic responses 

00:08:35
DEE RAY So often what you will see in the play therapy session is rote responses, meaning that they're saying things that they've read in books, that they may not necessarily, um, have affect with. "You're moving that over there." "You're, uh, you're feeling sad." You, you can decide what to do in here." And so they, they're, they're "right" responses, but they aren't necessarily responses that are matching the client. And the ability to match the client's affect is something that, um, new supervisees do struggle with. They are easily distracted by their own internal processes. So if they say something to a child in the playroom, they might actually then veer off for a second on, "Was that the right thing? Did I say the right thing? I'm not sure about that. Um, I might need to correct that," and then they're disconnected from the child and that moment. A lot of anxiety goes on in the play therapy session for these new supervisees, and they often are distracted just by their own level of anxiety. What might result, and this is not all the time, but, but does happen quite often, is, um, the anxiety results in possible panic responses when the child doesn't do something right or maybe makes too much noise or is aggressive in some way. You might see the therapist jump in session or, um, raise their voice, or just over-, um, overly respond to what's going on in the session. 

00:10:00
DEE RAY So as a supervisor, how do we wanna respond to a supervisee at this level? Well, one is we wanna go back to our conditions. We wanna think about empathic understanding, unconditional positive regard, and our own level of congruence. And what really is the most important quality that we're sharing here at this level is the empathic understanding. 

00:10:20
Stage 1: Skill Focused Supervisor Attitudinal Qualities Intense level of communicated empathic understanding involving the provision of some definitive answers to lower anxiety Limited expression of unconditional positive regard and congruence 

00:10:20
DEE RAY "I get it, you're nervous. It's okay to be nervous," "You wanna do it the right way," um, and really understanding that. Instead of coming from a developmental level that most supervisors are at is "there is no right way," "you can't do it that way." We really get into the supervisee's world of thinking there is a right way, um, how important it is them, for them to do that. And we wanna share that empathy with them. And the other part of that is then because of that, because we wanna understand their world, our level of conveying our congruence, like maybe we're a little bit worried about their skills or that we're, um, not sure they're right for play therapy, those kind of things we are holding back because we're giving, um, time for the process to work and to see is the supervisee gonna move out of this stage. And hopefully we're hoping to facilitate that. So we have limited levels of un-, of the congruence that we're sharing, also limited levels of unconditional positive regard. What isn't helpful to the supervisee at this stage is to just constantly be, um, telling them "anything goes," "it's okay," um, and that, that's not true unconditional positive regard, anyway. Uh, but what we wanna do is share with them that we accept them, but there are things that they need to be working on. 

00:11:35
DEE RAY So you have these qualities and you wanna share these qualities with your supervisee, but what does that really look like? What, what is the supervisor doing in the supervision session with a stage one supervisee? 

00:11:45
Stage 1 Supervisor Actions Answering questions Giving alternative responses Lots of reflective statements Lots of encouraging statements, remember playroom statements Sometimes accidents happen in here You just weren't sure what to do You figured it out Lots of observation Providing resources 

00:11:45
DEE RAY Well, the first thing is we are gonna answer questions. We are going to give them ideas on what to do with children in a session. Maybe give them some alternative responses, um, about what they could do instead of some of the statements that they're making. But we're concentrating on lots of those reflective statements, really, um, tapping into that empathic understanding. Lots of reflective statements about how the supervisee's feeling, um, what the supervisee is thinking, that we're, we're giving that back to them, that we really get them, we really understand them. The other thing is encouraging statements. Um, not praise statements, but encouraging statements. And, and we do this in the playroom, so it's very consistent to do this in supervision. So statements that you might already be familiar with, like "Sometimes accidents happen in here." That's a great statement for a supervisee. Sometimes accidents happen in the playroom. Sometimes the play therapist doesn't say the exact right thing. Um, "You just weren't sure what to do," or "You figured it out." These are encouraging statements to the supervisee that we want to share with them. And then I wanna say lots of observation so I, I don't, I wanna emphasize this, and I'll continue to emphasize this point, that video observation of play therapy is a critical part of play therapy supervision. Because it is such a non-verbal medium, we do not rely on self-report, that we really do watch those videos. And for level one supervisees, stage one supervisees, observation of videos is key to supervision. And additionally and finally, providing resources for them. They need books, they need, um, other videos to watch, they need things that they can pull from to increase their understanding of play therapy. 

00:13:25
DEE RAY So now we're ready to introduce some of our roleplays, and we'll start with Haley, and this is a stage one roleplay. 

00:13:30
DEE RAY Haley is roleplaying a typical supervisee in stage one of supervision. You will notice that she is nervous, concrete, and overly focused on doing therapy right. In this clip, I'd like for you to notice my responses as the supervisor, including the use of reflection to emphasize and connect with Haley, use of answering questions directly to address her need for concrete answers and reduce her anxiety, and use of process questions to initiate deeper levels of thinking about her role as a counselor. You will also notice my direction to move to watching the play therapy session on video before I fall into relying on self-report. 

00:14:10
Play Therapy Supervision 

00:14:10
HALEY Um, I'm okay, I have my tape, but I have a lot of questions first to be sure that I ask you. Um, so we can watch it after. 

00:14:20
DEE RAY Oh, yeah, that's fine. 

00:14:20
HALEY Okay. Um, okay. So, the kid that I was seeing, he started painting, and so I know that we're supposed to, um, like, stay, like track and everything while they're painting, but we're not supposed to name things, so I didn't know how to say, "Oh, well, you're painting a blue," 'cuz I couldn't say "blue" so I couldn't name the color, so I didn't really know how to handle that. And then I know that we're supposed to encourage the painting and so I wanted to say, like, he was asking me, "Do you like it?" and, you know, I wanted to encourage the effort, but I didn't know if I should, you know, say that he did a good job because, I mean, it seemed like it, but I know we're not supposed to say that. Uh, so I just kinda felt really stuck, I didn't know what to say. Uh. 

00:15:00
DEE RAY Let me stop you there 'cuz there's two questions I heard already, so is that okay if I stop you? Okay. Um, so it sounds like you're taking like, straight from Dr. Landreth's, uh, on, um, so not naming things as you go. 

00:15:15
HALEY Right. Exactly, yeah. I wanna do it right, like it says to do it, so. 

00:15:20
DEE RAY So he was painting and you were, uh, seeing that it was blue, but you didn't wanna call it blue, so you weren't sure what to call it? Okay, well, sometimes, um, you know, just using real simple words like, "You're painting that," or, "Oh, you're, you're using that," um, instead of actually choosing the color. 

00:15:35
HALEY Okay. 

00:15:40
DEE RAY Um, how, does that sound like that would work? 

00:15:40
HALEY Yeah, it does. And so, but if he's doing that for a long time, do I just keep saying the same thing over and over 'cuz I know we're not supposed to repeat ourselves. That sounds like it would get kind of repetitive. 

00:15:50
DEE RAY Yeah, so, yeah, and annoying, too, to the child. So, um, you know, slow down and, you know, like, "Oh, you're painting that," and, you know, he continues to paint, "Ah, you're getting that there," you know, just simple phrases, (inaudible ) your voice. Try and match if he's being quiet, then you do less responses. Um, like that. 

00:16:10
HALEY Okay. Yeah, so that's okay? 

00:16:15
DEE RAY Yeah. 

00:16:15
HALEY Okay. 

00:16:15
DEE RAY It, it sounds like maybe that's what you did? 

00:16:20
HALEY Um. 

00:16:20
DEE RAY 'Cuz you were kind of nodding. 

00:16:20
HALEY Yeah, I mean, I tried to do that, but, I mean, it was hard kind of to respond just 'cuz I didn't know what was right. I just kinda sat there like, okay, so I tried a few of those responses, but, yeah. So. 

00:16:30
DEE RAY Okay. And then the second thing you were talking about was that, something about the picture? What was that? I'm sorry. 

00:16:35
HALEY Yeah, so he finished and he said, you know, "Oh, so how does it look?" or "Do you like it?" something along those lines. So, and I. 

00:16:45
DEE RAY And what did you say when he said, "How do you like it?' 

00:16:45
HALEY So I said, "Well, how, what do you think about it?" which, then I asked a question which I know I wasn't supposed to do, um, but I also know I'm supposed to like turn our sensibility to him and not, you know, give him the answer and let him come up with it. So I didn't know what to do. So I was really trying to. 

00:17:05
DEE RAY So he was gonna, he asked a question, "What do you think about it?" or "Do you like it?" something like that? 

00:17:10
HALEY Yeah. 

00:17:10
DEE RAY What did he respond when you did that? 

00:17:10
HALEY Uh, then he said, "Well, I wanna know what you think about it." And so, then we kinda got into that which, you know, and I just, I really, I was really lost. 

00:17:20
DEE RAY And you kinda were struggling with him on that part? And, um, I'm just thinking, what, what did you, if you had to do it over again, what, you wouldn't have asked the question, and what would you have said? Would you say something differently? 

00:17:30
HALEY Well I think, um, you know, to make a reflection that still returns responsibility to him, 'cuz I know that's what we're supposed to do. So to say something like, you know, oh, you know, "What you think matters." 

00:17:45
DEE RAY What you think matters? 

00:17:45
HALEY Or something, you know, "I think it's important that you decide that," or something like that. 

00:17:50
DEE RAY So then returning that responsibility back to him and letting him decide, you know, what he wants. So, um, so if I said to you, "What, what do you think about my picture? What, do you like it?" what would you say? 

00:18:05
HALEY I think it's important what you think about it. 

00:18:05
DEE RAY Okay, but not, what, do you like it? 

00:18:10
HALEY Ah, see, that gets really hard! Yeah, yeah. 

00:18:15
DEE RAY Well, you could use a phrase like, um, "It seems you really want me to like it," you know, like 'cuz it seems like that is why I'm asking you. Or "It seems like you really like it," you know, if you think that the child really likes it, 'cuz, you know, it seems like you really like it. Um, or you could say again, "What's important to me is that, is what you think about it." So we, do any of those sound like they would work for you? 

00:18:40
HALEY Yeah, I like the, it's important for you to, or for me to like what you did. I like that first one. That seems to fit. That seems to still reflect what he's like, saying. 

00:18:45
DEE RAY Yeah. And now, I just wanna bring out, it sounds, um, you know, you got your list and you've got these questions and it sounds like you've done a really great job of taking in the play therapy information and, and knowing, you know, how to be non-directive in the playroom. Um, you seem really nervous about it. How, how are you doing with being in the playroom? 

00:19:10
HALEY Well, I still have some more questions and so I feel like I just don't really, like I'm in there and it's really hard sometimes to actually come up with a response 'cuz I wanna make sure that I'm giving the right response, and there's so many different choices and which one's right at that time, and then, you know, different situations come up that aren't really addressed in the book, and if I wanna do it how we're supposed to, then I don't know how to respond. 

00:19:35
DEE RAY Um, because in your mind there's this right way to do it? 

00:19:40
HALEY Yeah. 

00:19:40
DEE RAY Yeah. And you're afraid you're gonna mess all that up. And if you mess all that up, let's, let's say you go in and you say everything wrong, like total opposite of what you learned, um, what do you think would happen? 

00:19:50
HALEY Well, I don't think that I would build a relationship with the child like you're supposed to 'cuz, you know, if, those skills wouldn't be taught if that wasn't how you're supposed to do that, and so it wouldn't be therapeutic, it would just be something else, and I'm here to be therapeutic. 

00:20:05
DEE RAY So what's most important to you is that you wanna use the relationship to be therapeutic with the child. And, and then, so it's important to you to get these things right in order to be able to do that. 

00:20:15
HALEY Right. 

00:20:15
DEE RAY There's a lot riding on you saying the right responses. Well, I'm here to help that. I mean, that's something I can definitely say, you know, why not try this response, why not try this response. Um, but, and I think that'll probably be a lot of what we do in these beginning supervision times, um, but I'd like to see as we move forward, is you start bringing in, um, your ideas of maybe what you felt was the right response instead of what appeared to be the right response 'cuz sometimes even Garry Landreth gives the wrong response, so. Um, and, and it doesn't. 

00:20:55
HALEY What do you think about it? 

00:20:55
DEE RAY And it doesn't negatively affect a relationship overall. Um, you know, remembering to grasp onto those, those big concepts about what really is the relationship about. And then we can explore some of that supervision about what really promotes having a relationship with the child, as well as learning what, what good responses are. Things that will help in the playroom. How does that sound to you? 

00:21:25
HALEY Yeah, that sounds like a really different way than how I've been approaching it, so I think that that could be a good way, maybe less stressful way, to, and less, yeah, anxiety-producing in the moment. Not focus on that and really just focus on building a relationship. So. 

00:21:35
DEE RAY And you seem still kind of anxious right now. 

00:21:40
HALEY Yeah, well it seems really hard too, though, 'cuz I do wanna make sure that I do it right and that's (inaudible ), so how to kind of make both those things happen, um, well, it just seems scary 'cuz I don't know how it'll work out. 

00:21:50
DEE RAY Well let's watch your video, and I'm gonna get some more questions, but that's okay, I'll make sure we have time for them. 

00:21:55
HALEY Okay. 

00:22:00
DEE RAY Um, but let's watch your video first and go through some of those. You might have other questions that come up, and we can go through together. 

00:22:05
HALEY Okay. That sounds good. 

00:22:05
DEE RAY Now we're ready to move on to stage two. What does the supervisee look like in stage two? 

00:22:10
Stage 2: Experimentation and Questioning Supervisee Dynamics in Supervision Question person-centered philosophy Possible attraction to directive methods Seek evidence for effectiveness but lack experience in seeing it Defensive to reflections of feelings by supervisor 

00:22:10
DEE RAY Supervisees in this stage generally question the person-centered philosophy; that's very normal. Um, whether they end up being person-centered or whether they end up following another philosophy, questioning the person-centered philosophy is almost always part of the supervision process. And they might be possibly attracted to more directive methods, seeking answers, seeking, um, techniques that might work, um, that might be the right way of doing therapy. Um, they do seek evidence for effectiveness, so this is where they're moving a little past the stage one where they are no longer kind of stuck on their responses, but they're trying to see is anything changing, is anything happening? But the problem in this stage is they don't have any experience or context to see if effectiveness is happening, and this is where the supervisor can really jump in to help out, um, to say here, here's what I've seen in progress. Here's what I see changing with this child. They are typically defensive to reflections of feeling by the supervisor. So for example, if, at the first stage, you were saying, "You're very nervous," they were like, "Oh, yes, right. I am." In the second stage, if you were to reflect something like, "You seem very nervous," "Oh, no, no, I've done this before. I, I'm comfortable with this. I, I know what to do." So you get a little bit more defensiveness and then the deeper you go with your reflections of feelings, you might come up against deeper levels of defensiveness. 

00:23:35
DEE RAY So stage two is one I wanna use kind of as a warning, so it's, it's a cautious stage because, um, what are the dynamics in the play session, this is the part that becomes a little tricky. Um, because there's a little bit more defensiveness going on in supervision sessions and there's this questioning of the method that's being used, you will see the supervisee in the play session often start to experiment with different methods without letting the supervisor know. 

00:24:00
Stage 2: Experimentation and Questioning Supervisee Dynamics in Play Session Experimentation of new methods without supervisor knowledge Possible lack of limits to support permissiveness Most likely stage for harm to occur 

00:24:00
DEE RAY The experimenting with different methods, that's not a problem, that's something that goes on for all counselors. It is the starting new things without a good background and without working with your supervisor, and those are the areas that we're concerned about in, um, supervision. That they're, um, one of the things that might happen also in the playroom is that they actually, if they're moving far toward the person-centered side, is they might, their permissiveness might actually be too much, that they're not setting limits. Um, so examples of this, I wanna give a couple of examples of, um, how that works. Experimentation of new methods, that would be, uh, um, a play therapist that comes in, they've been doing child-centered play therapy, but they decide their 5-year-old client needs more directiveness. So they pull an activity that's really meant for a 9- or 10-year-old out of a book and they take into the play session and they try to do that. Um, that's one kind of thing that will often happen. On the other side, the ones that err more toward the person-centered side, is kind of this crazy lack of limits setting. So in our clinic what we've experienced is throwing of hammers that've broken mirrors, um, painting the entire room, painting the child's entire self. That really the therapist is sending out this mess-, message of anything goes, and it's, it's really coming from maybe a lot of different places for the counselor, um, the counselor supervisee, that they're struggling with the philosophy and what's really supposed to be going on. 

00:25:35
DEE RAY I find this stage the stage that we're most likely to see harm occur, um, as facilitated by the counselor. That the counselor just is waffling and not seeking help and, um, so during this stage we're gonna move into what the supervisor does, but I'm definitely a little more on alert when the supervisee is at this stage. 

00:25:55
DEE RAY And before we can talk about what the supervisor does in session, supervision session to respond to the stage two, the attitudinals becomes super important at this level. 

00:26:05
Stage 2: Experimentation and Questioning Supervisor Attitudinal Qualities Communication of empathic understanding remains high Growth in congruence regarding supervisor relationship and confrontation Unconditional positive regard is experienced, but still limited due to possible misinterpretation by supervisee that "anything goes" 

00:26:05
DEE RAY Because this, this is the place where the supervisor might be getting frustrated, might not understand why the supervisee isn't coming to them and talking to them. So our empathic understanding needs to remain high. Why is my supervisee scared to talk to me? Why do they think it's a risk to share with me that they're not in the same belief system as maybe that I am? Um, what can I do to really send the message to them that I understand that they're questioning and wanting to do different things? I am going to start being a little bit more congruent with them. I will in this stage share I'm, I'm concerned about how you're setting limits, and that there aren't enough limits going on in the playroom. Or I'm, I see that you're really trying to grow, um, but I'm concerned that you've gone in this different direction. So the confrontation, um, starts to move in to raise the levels of congruence. 

00:27:00
DEE RAY The unconditional positive regard is still experienced, um, by the supervisor, but we are limited in how we, um, share this with the supervisee because at this stage you really don't wanna be sending any message that "anything goes" because this is where the supervisee will take that in and say, "Oh, well, I can just do anything!" That, my supervisor thinking that I'm okay and I'm great, so I'll just do anything. We have to worry about that at stage, about how that's perceived. 

00:27:25
DEE RAY So for this stage I have lots of suggestions for supervisors. I personally am challenged by this stage of supervision and I've worked hard in this area. So first of all, lots of reflective statements, that we want the supervisor to understand that we, um, the supervisee, to understand that we understand them. And so we are doing lots of reflection here, maybe even more than in stage one, we're doing that. 

00:27:45
Stage 2 Supervisor Actions Lots of reflective statements to increase supervisor empathic understanding Providing direction for play sessions and parent consultations - including limit-setting for supervisee It seems like you really want the child to be able to express himself but children are not for coming into the waiting room covered in paint. You can have him wash in the bathroom before you return him to parents. Lots of observation and monitoring Caring confrontation Following though on cases in each supervision session Expression of unconditional positive regard specific to supervisee belief system Sounds like you may be doubting this way of working You're not sure this fits who you are 

00:27:45
DEE RAY Um, we're providing direction for play sessions and parent consultations. We might actually be providing limit-setting for the supervisee. I've certainly done my share of that. An example might be, "It seems like you really want the child to be able to express himself, but children are not for coming into the waiting room covered in paint. You can have him wash in the bathroom before you return him to parents. So you can see I used our typical limit-setting that we do with children with the supervisee and really letting them know that I understand and I care, but there's a limit here about what they need to be doing. Lots and lots of observation and monitoring. Um, this is where the supervisee might likely, uh, bring in only, um, only videos that they approve of, that they think they're doing a good job, so this is where I kind of wanna surprise them with, "I'd like to move 20 minutes forward in this session and watch it," instead of just watching what they're bringing in. Um, lots of caring confrontation. "Um, I know this is hard and it feels like criticism, um, and I see that you're working hard, uh, but this not setting limits is just not working. You need to be setting more limits in session." That would be how I would do a confrontation at this stage. The other thing is follow through on cases in each supervision session. So if I'm talking to them in one supervision session about a client, I'm gonna come back in a week later and talk with them again about that same client. I'm going to follow through. Um, and then my expression of unconditional positive regard is specific to the supervisee's belief system because here's where I want to let them know if they're doubting this way of working, that's okay. If they're not sure that this is who they are, that's okay. Let's talk about that. Let's get that out in the open so we can really work with it. 

00:29:30
DEE RAY So now I wanna share an example of a roleplay in stage two. And at this you can see all the dynamics I was just talking about. This roleplay is with David. 

00:29:40
DEE RAY David is roleplaying a supervisee in stage two of supervision. You will notice that David is focused on directing the supervisor, me, away from actual observation of the play therapy session. He prefers to rely on self-report and seems defensive when his feelings are reflected. As the supervisor, my goal is to reduce David's anxiety so that he feel safe to share his feelings regarding his session and his actual performance in session. Also I continue to set the limit that the video will need to be observed regardless of self-report. Here's David. 

00:30:15
DEE RAY All right, so how'd it go this week, David? 

00:30:15
DAVID Um, well, it, it went okay, I think. I mean, um, I, I think I'm just finally getting in the groove of, um, really just focusing on my child, really just following him, you know? I just keep thinking about everything I've been taught, just, you know, let the child lead, and so, uh, you know, lots, lots going on in there. Um. 

00:30:40
DEE RAY So really embracing that child-centered way of working. 

00:30:45
DAVID Yeah. I'm trying to. Um, his, uh, you know, he's, he's really active and, um, just trying to think about, you know, what's going on for him and no matter what happens, um, you know, just kind of go where he goes and, uh, you know? It's, it's nice, and I really see him, I think I'm connecting with him, yeah. 

00:31:05
DEE RAY Well let's take a look and see. 

00:31:10
DAVID Okay, um, well it's, there's, I guess I said, you know, there's a lot going on. Um, part of, part of what happened was, um, you know, he's, he's really active. I guess I kind of wanna set this up for you a little bit. He just, he's really active in the room so, um, it took a long time to clean the room up. Uh, you know, he, he used a lot of different things in the room and, um, had a lot of energy coming in, and I, and I just felt like he had more energy than I expected and went straight to the bop bag and was really pounding on that and then after he was done with that he moved to, um, lots of the figures on the, on the shelves and started, um, grabbing them and, and wanting to, um, play with them and do a lot of stuff with them. 

00:31:50
DEE RAY Yeah, and I'll stop to say that I wanted to let you know, Kathy told me that it took, you know, like three people and 20 minutes to clean up the room afterward. 

00:32:00
DAVID Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I guess. 

00:32:05
DEE RAY It was pretty much all over the place, you know? 

00:32:05
DAVID He was, yeah, he was all over the place. I mean, he used, he used all the animals and, um, the animals ended up all different places around the room. He, um, he grabbed, um, all the different dolls and the, and the doll house and the babies and, um, and they ended up all over the place and some were in the sand and, um, you know, some kinda came flying by me a few times. 

00:32:30
DEE RAY So did you set some limits? 

00:32:35
DAVID Um, well, you know, I figured it was okay 'cuz I, you know, it seemed like he really needed to work something out and so I just kept thinking, um, you know, I'd let him go with it for a little while and kinda see where it went and, um, you know, he just, um, it just seemed like he had that unending energy to really just, um, had take some anger out on, on, um, different things in the room and so. 

00:33:05
DEE RAY So you really wanted to respect that in his process, and so you chose not to set limits? 

00:33:10
DAVID Um, well, I guess I just, you know, I guess I felt okay about what was going on and, um, and had, I didn't want to, um, I guess, interrupt his flow of play. I didn't wanna kinda stop him. It seemed like he really needed to express himself. 

00:33:30
DEE RAY So if you actually set the limit, you would be interfering with him? Is that what you're thinking? 

00:33:40
DAVID Yeah, I guess, yeah, I guess, um, yeah, I'm worried about that. 

00:33:45
DEE RAY Yeah. You do seem concerned. 

00:33:50
DAVID Yeah. 

00:33:50
DEE RAY Well why don't we take a look and see where it went? 

00:33:55
DAVID Okay, well, you know, it just seemed like so much of what he was doing was kinda anger-related and so it seemed really therapeutic and, you know, like I was saying, he used all these different things in the room and then a few times, um, I mentioned, some things would come flying by me, and, um, sometimes he'd pick something up and, and wanna, um, you know, I could tell he was, he was needing to throw it across the room, and I couldn't tell if it was gonna go like right at me or if it was gonna go somewhere else. And, um, like, you know, I could tell, you know, he would get up a few times and have something in his hand and look at me and, and, you know, I wasn't sure what was gonna happen, but, uh, I just knew that he really needed to really get that, get some emotion out. 

00:34:40
DEE RAY Yeah, and you have such a strong belief in the child-centered way of working, and a lot of times that can be hard to integrate limit-setting into that belief system, and so that's why it's so important for us to actually kind of see what's happening in session and what's going on. And I'm getting a sense from you that you're wanting to process it more verbally and not watch it or, or, I'm not sure what your process is right now. 

00:35:05
DAVID Yeah, no, I guess, um, partly I just wanna kinda set it up for you so that you have a sense of what the, the background is, um, I guess before we watch it, and. 

00:35:15
DEE RAY Really going to understand where you were coming from in the session? Is that, is that important for you for me to understand? 

00:35:25
DAVID Yeah. And I think also just where he was coming from and just, um, just the sense I had that he, you know, was kind of, um, really just overwhelmed by emotion and feeling that he could express it a lot. I don't know, I guess I'm just feeling a need to, um, you to kinda understand what it was like to be in the room. 

00:35:40
DEE RAY Yeah, you know, like one thing I've learned being a supervisor is there's always some barrier to me understanding what it's really like in the room so it is really helpful to have you explain it, especially what you've been thinking, but what I find is the most helpful is for, for you to kind of explain that as we're watching it, and then we can get a sense of, of what was going on with limit setting, did it need to be set, did it not, would it have interfered? Um, let's go and put that in. 

00:36:10
DAVID Okay. 

00:36:10
DEE RAY Now we're gonna move in a little bit later part of the process that's still stage two, and this roleplay is with Emily. You'll see she's a little farther down the road than David was, yet still really starting to question what she's doing in her therapy. 

00:36:25
DEE RAY Emily is roleplaying a supervisee in later process of stage two. She's not experimenting with techniques or new ways of doing play therapy, but she is questioning its effectiveness, especially in regard to a current client. She's questioning the match of CCPT with her own belief system and is finding that she is not quite sure. As the supervisor, my role is to support her exploration and facilitate her need to integrate her beliefs with her role as a counselor. 

00:36:50
EMILY I've been doing CCPT and feeling really confident with it and feeling ground in it, but part of me is just not feeling like it's maybe enough. 

00:37:00
DEE RAY Like it's enough? Um, so it, you're seeing, you know, a pretty good number of clients at this point, um, well, tell me more about that, then, that you feel like it's not enough. 

00:37:15
EMILY Um, I really believe in the principles and I really, um, I really hold this very dearly, but sometimes with older kids like 8 or 9, um, I struggle with sticking to the principles, um, not wanting to incorporate, and I do wanna incorporate sometimes, more, um, behavioral type things or more cognitive, beginning to think about cognitive things and activities, um, and I, I feel a little restricted and I, I don't know if, um, if that's me or if that's part of, if that's the theory or where the block is for me. 

00:38:00
DEE RAY And even as you say it, you sound kind of hesitant like. 

00:38:00
EMILY Yeah, 'cuz I've been doing it, I've been feeling, um, really confident about it, but it, but this, these questions are coming up, um, with clients that, like, maybe have anger, um, and that's something that they wanna work on and that's what their parents wanna work on, that, that sometimes that I think there are activities and like, cognitive behavior type things that may work, but then I feel, yeah. 

00:38:30
DEE RAY Might work better with that age group. So, um, so I'm just saying in terms of what we were just watching, the 9-year-old, um, and you said that she's been having, um, problems with, uh, you know, with rages and screaming and all of that kind of thing. So how is this different for you than, 'cuz we've been in supervision before with pretty similar case with a, with a 5-year-old, um, and this is, this didn't come up for you then, so I was just wondering what the difference is here for you? 

00:39:05
EMILY Um, I think for me it's, it's that developmentally the age differ-, the cognitive difference, um, that I believe at 8 or 9 a little bit more concrete type, um, activities could be helpful where at 5 I don't, I think the, um, expression and the, and what they're doing in play therapy is so awesome, that it's when they get older and there is more cognitive ability that I find myself wanting to insert some activities. Yeah. 

00:39:35
DEE RAY So you feel like maybe you're not using all the things you can use that they have available to them. 

00:39:40
EMILY Right. Yeah. 

00:39:40
DEE RAY And they do need to kind of think through and, and maybe take on some, um, I guess, information, educational, yeah, yeah, definitely the educational piece. And I guess, Emily, then my question would be about then how do you make that choice? I mean, are you saying that you would want to go back, well, let's say you started to use some of this you're your 9-year-old, and would you wanna go back with some of these other, uh, younger children that you've been working with and do that too, or, how would you make a decision about when to work in some of this cognitive work that you're wanting to? 

00:40:20
EMILY Um, hopefully very carefully. Um, looking at development and, and really assessing where the child is, um, not just where they're supposed to be at 5 or 7 or 8, but really assessing, um, their cognitive functioning as well as how much they seem to be benefiting from what I've been doing with CCPT. Um, as far as does this seem to be fulfilling their need or do, do they seem to be lacking or with some of the older kids, even bored? 

00:40:55
DEE RAY Oh, okay. Yeah, so you have that experience of a different affective memory. 

00:41:00
EMILY Right, yeah. 

00:41:00
DEE RAY With CCPT. Um, yeah, so, I'm just feeling that I wanna support what it is that you're thinking and feeling, and it sounds like this might be kind of new for you, this thought, because this is the first time I've heard it coming up for you. 

00:41:20
EMILY I think it, it's, with my pervious training with adolescents, that it's, it's been there and I've been able to separate young child and adolescent, um, but for me the, that 8, that 8, 9, it, it, there's just something that feels a little off in the room, um. 

00:41:45
DEE RAY And it's felt fuzzier to you. 

00:41:45
EMILY Yeah. Kind of fuzzy. Where I feel much more confident with the, um, younger and the older set in the playroom what to do. 

00:41:55
DEE RAY Now, now, of course, you know, I would advocate that you do operate from one theory, uh, you know, if you (inaudible ) across the board, what, what are you leaning toward, then? 

00:42:10
EMILY I'm leaning towards integral theory, um, which would advocate for CCPT, um, with the younger kids, but it really takes into account the developmental, um, and, and meeting the client where they are right then. Um, so that's where the careful consideration of development and, um, and needs, also, would come into play. I hope that that would give me a framework to really look at and decide versus "wing it." 

00:42:40
DEE RAY And I do know that you've been interested in integral for a while, but really I've heard you talk about more with adults, that kind of thing. So, are you seeing that it would be a consistent way to look at people across the board from 4 years old to 90 years old? 

00:42:55
EMILY I do. 

00:42:55
DEE RAY Okay. 

00:43:00
EMILY Um, I think this is the fuzzy age. Um, and integral theory, and then I think also just maybe with how to best work with, um, that age group, yeah. 

00:43:15
DEE RAY Fits more who you are and how you look at people. Yeah. And so do you see yourself being able to do what looks more like CCPT with the younger children or does that change if you, coming from the integral? 

00:43:25
EMILY I don't see that changing. 

00:43:25
DEE RAY Okay. 

00:43:30
EMILY Um, because really, developmentally, I, I mean, I just feel so strongly that that is the intervention, um, and that is what's most effective. Um, I think, I, I wonder, I mean, I wonder about employing more, um, behavioral, cognitive type interventions, even like a learning type encouragement and integral setting type things with the older, a little bit older, but, um. 

00:44:00
DEE RAY Now, that all sounds like, uh, that's new to you. 

00:44:05
EMILY Yes. 

00:44:05
DEE RAY Kind of, that you're kind of thinking if I really do embrace this integral way of working, what parts would I bring in, what pieces. 

00:44:10
EMILY Right, yes. And it's scary to know what, I wanna make sure that I'm being theoretically consistent, but it's also new terrain. 

00:44:20
DEE RAY Yeah. Yeah, I agree. And you've still got that look on your face. 

00:44:20
EMILY Yeah, like, "I'm not quite sure!" 

00:44:25
DEE RAY Well how can I help you, then, in your process? What, what can I do to help? 

00:44:30
EMILY I guess what would be really helpful for me is, um, when I'm kind of brainstorming about, okay, this seems to fit developmentally, this seems to fit theoretically, just being able to run it by you since I'm trying new things. Like, I'm thinking about, um, really kind of directing some stuff about anger, um, how does that feel and I guess just having some backing on, you know, this, this seems to be developmentally appropriate. Yeah. 

00:45:00
DEE RAY That it would be okay for you to break out and do something a little different. 

00:45:05
EMILY Right, yeah. 

00:45:05
DEE RAY And I think, I hope that I can provide that for you. Um, the thing, the only thing that I would ask of you in turn is that, that you're intentional in what you're doing there. Uh, you know, that you don't go to session and say, "Oh, now would be a good time to (inaudible )," that, you know, that you really are thinking about where you're going with your clients and what that means for what you're doing in each session. 

00:45:30
EMILY Right. And, and that's so important to me as something that, um, I'm really trying to be intentional about is that, and I think, um, I think that's where I get stuck in, in, in not doing anything different because I'm, I wanna make sure that I'm doing the right thing. 

00:45:50
DEE RAY Yeah. Yeah. Which you're still not sure about. 

00:45:50
EMILY Yeah, exactly. 

00:45:50
DEE RAY All right, well, let's just use the next few weeks to kind of move through it and, and see where we go. 

00:45:55
EMILY I'll bring you some ideas, and, and we 

00:46:00
DEE RAY Now we're moving to stage three. In stage three, we start to see some differences happening with our supervisee. They become more, um, based in their belief system, operating from their belief system. 

00:46:10
Stage 3: Philosophical Decision-Making Transforms Into Practice Supervisee Dynamics in Supervision Comes to terms with belief system Rejects or embraces CCPT philosophy If embrace CCPT, exploration of process, patterns, and themes Openness to personal exploration of feelings in relationship to play therapy If reject CCPT, emerge with respect for CCPT 

00:46:10
DEE RAY And we come, they start to come to terms with what they believe and trying to integrate what they're doing in their play therapy. So typically this is the stage where either they make a decision about rejecting Child-Centered Play Therapy or embracing Child-Centered Play Therapy. Either one is fine, but just, that's, this is the stage we usually see that decision made in. If they embrace Child-Centered Play Therapy, then what happens in supervision is it becomes more of an exploration of process, patterns, and themes, really looking at the child from a child-centered perspective. Um, if they reject Child-Centered Play Therapy, if our, if the supervisor has done their job right, what we hope is that they will emerge with a respect for Child-Centered Play Therapy, just in acknowledgement that it doesn't fit their belief system. 

00:47:00
DEE RAY In this stage you, um, whether they reject or accept Child-Centered Play Therapy, what I usually find is an openness to personal exploration of feelings. Um, that this is where we really do start to get into conversation about what's going on with them, their levels of self-doubt, um, how they relate to children, the really deeper conversations that take part in supervision start to happen in stage three. 

00:47:20
DEE RAY And then what are they doing in play therapy? What's going on in play therapy is you start to see their greater comfort level in session. 

00:47:25
Stage 3: Philosophical Decision-Making Transforms Into Practice Supervisee Dynamics in Play Therapy Session Greater comfort level in session Able to reach new levels of congruence Able to experience the moment If not CCPT, practicing techniques with new philosophy with knowledge if supervisor 

00:47:25
DEE RAY More of them being who they are, not this separate person acting as a play therapist. They're able to reach these new levels of congruence, and they can start to, this is a little bit hard, but you can see in this stage, they start to experience the child in the moment. Play therapy becomes about being immediately present. If they're not Child-Centered Play Therapy, this is the stage where they start practicing the techniques from their new philosophy, but how it differs from stage two is now they're involving their supervisor in that process. They start to say, "I'd really like to do this from my belief system. What do you think about this?" And you engage in a conversation with them about their level of knowledge and experience and if it really does fit for this child in this situation. 

00:48:10
DEE RAY And for the supervisor we start to change our expression of the attitudinal qualities. 

00:48:15
Stage 3: Philosophical Decision-Making Transforms Into Practice Supervisor Attitudinal Qualities Equal levels of expression of congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathic understanding Congruence highly valued by supervisee 

00:48:15
DEE RAY We start to give equal levels of congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathic understanding. In stage three it becomes a fun supervisor experience where the supervisee actually wants feedback. In, in stage one they typically want praise, in stage two there's a lot of hiding going on and, um, and kind of this lack of congruence with them about what they want from the supervisor, but in stage three is when, is when you have a supervisee come in and they say to you, and this is often my experience, "I really wanna know what you think about what I did here." And they really mean it. They wanna know what I think about what they did there. And that becomes this more equal relationship. We're moving toward that where they can start to really accept feedback but filter it through their own internal processes. 

00:49:05
DEE RAY And so what does it look like when I'm trying to share these attitudinal qualities with the supervisee at stage three? Well, I'm helping them focus in on their personal belief system. 

00:49:15
Stage 3 Supervisor Actions Helping supervisee focus in on personal belief system Statements of unconditional positive regard for supervisee belief system Observation of sessions at equal balance with processing with supervisee Limited directive statements - limited sharing of statements regarding what supervisee should do Increase in taking in supervisee's observations of client and play process Sharing identification of themes and moments of progress related to child and supervisee Ensuring that supervisee is receiving adequate education on methods used in playroom 

00:49:15
DEE RAY I'm making lots of statements of unconditional positive regard for them and their belief systems. Um, sending out that message that they're okay and it's okay to question what their doing and to make different decisions about it. And let's process a little bit more. Let's spend some more time on how they're making those decisions. I'm observing sessions still, but now it's at equal balance with the processing. So it's, it's kind of less of the actual observation and monitoring of sessions, and an increase of our talking and processing together. One of the things I've had to work on is limiting my directive statements, um, at this stage, that often I will not, um, I'll be a little slow to catch up to where the supervisee is, and I'm still giving them statements of "I think maybe you should do this," "I think this will work," and instead this is the stage I really need to back off and I need to be just letting them work through some of their own beliefs about what should be happening in this, in the session. I can trust them to do this at this stage. I am also increasing and taking in their observations. Before, I was listening to the empathic, um, but maybe what they were saying wasn't that well fit to what was going on. Now what they're saying fits more, um, with what's going on with their clients, and I wanna take that in as part of my processing and supervision. 

00:50:35
DEE RAY Um, the other thing we're doing is we're working on looking at themes and moments of progress, trying to see can we evaluate what's going on with the child, is the child moving forward. And we're doing that fairly equally together as supervisor and supervisee. And the other thing is if they are moving into other methods other than CCPT, I'm making sure they're receiving adequate education in those methods, that I'm not just saying, "Oh, sure, go out and be CVT in the playroom." I am making sure that they are getting the education to do that in the playroom. 

00:51:10
DEE RAY For stage three, I wanted to present two roleplays that are really different from each other, but you'll see some similarities too because they are in the same stage. Sinem is a supervisee who has decided that she is not aligned with the Child-Centered Play Therapy belief system, and you can see how that's handled in stage three. Whereas Katie is more questioning. She appears up to this point to have been child-centered, and her questioning goes in a different direction in her roleplay. So I'd like for you to notice the differences between these two supervisees, yet they're both still in the same stage. 

00:51:40
DEE RAY Sinem is roleplaying a supervisee in stage three supervision. Sinem has identified that she is not a Child-Centered Play Therapist but feels more aligned with a Adlerian approach to counseling. Although she has integrated Adlerian beliefs with her adult counseling, she is now feeling confident to extend her Adlerian way of working to children. With Sinem, my supervisor role is to ensure that she is moving to Adlerian because of her integrated belief system, not because of self-doubt or other external reasons. You will notice that I use reflection and statements of congruence to facilitate this process. Additionally, I'm ethically bound to ensure that she is engaging in practices for which she is trained. And finally, I will continue to act as supervisor in monitoring this new way of doing play therapy while providing support and suggestions for additional training. 

00:52:30
DEE RAY Katie is also demonstrating characteristics of stage three supervisee, but unlike Sinem, she is more impacted by her intrapersonal processes interfering with her beliefs about people and therapy. This is a common dilemma for counselors. In this supervision session, we are demonstrating how unconditional positive self-regard becomes part of counseling and the counselor's struggle. As Katie's supervisor, my role is to facilitate her awareness of this intrapersonal process and not chalk it up to the need to change what she's doing in counseling. 

00:53:00
Session with Sinem 

00:53:05
DEE RAY Okay. 

00:53:05
SINEM So as you can see, it's been like, six sessions so far and we're still struggling, I'm still struggling with not getting information from him about what's going on in his life. And he lives with his grandma right now, um, for like, two years. And he sees his parents during the weekends and I don't get to communicate with the parents because they're not willing to come in. And I don't know what's going on, how their relationships are. And I'm really struggling with getting to know about the family atmosphere, how the child is trying to feel significant, what ways he is using, um, in terms of, you know, getting more about his lifestyle. So being nondirective has been, I, I feel like it's not working well for this specific client at least. 

00:54:00
DEE RAY So, yeah, so in what we were just watching he was pretty nonverbal, and so you don't feel like he's moving along like you'd like him to. 

00:54:10
SINEM Yeah, he's not really playing with things. He likes drawing, um, but he usually draws things in a way that I'm not able to see them. Uh, so I just keep reflecting on what he's doing or anything else because I don't get anything else from him. Um, so I, I just feel like I need to do something to be able to interact more with him in terms of building a relationship, plus getting to know what's going on in his life. 

00:54:45
DEE RAY And you've been conceptualizing Adlerian theory for a while now. Um, and that's been quite clear in our supervision. Um, what are you thinking might work as far as coming from an Adlerian perspective? 

00:55:00
SINEM Well, I was doing some research on what kind of activities or things I can use to help him to connect with me more. And as he likes drawing, uh, I was thinking about kinetic family drawing. And, uh, I was thinking if I can ask him to draw his family doing something and then, um, just ask questions about, you know, their relationships and how the child is similar to mom and dad and, um, what they like doing together, what they don't like doing together to, um, have better understanding of the family environment. 

00:55:40
DEE RAY So kind of bring it instead of waiting for him to express it, you try and, and bring it out. 

00:55:45
SINEM Yeah, 'cuz from what I've heard from the grandma, she has been talking about how withdrawn he is in his social environments in general. Even with the grandma, he doesn't talk, he doesn't communicate that much. And I was thinking if I try to bring it up a little bit more, and I'm not saying that he's gonna open up, uh, all of a sudden, but maybe he will feel safer to see that I'm understanding him by my reflections of what, what's going on, um, as he talks more about his family. 

00:56:15
DEE RAY See, and actually your goal is that you would create an understanding, that you would really be able to see how he sees his family. 

00:56:25
SINEM Yeah. 

00:56:25
DEE RAY Now, do you, because you've been operating, I mean, you've been conceptualizing Adlerian, but you've really been operating mostly child-centered. Do you have any concerns or, or reservations now, doing something like this? 

00:56:35
SINEM Um, yes. It seems right for me to think, even think about asking questions, um, because I really like being nondirective but sometimes I feel stuck, I feel like I need to do something more to be able to give more knowledge about lifestyle, especially, and to be able to reflect it back. Um, so right now I know that I really want to do it, but it's just like something's holding me back from it, like my anxiety level probably. 

00:57:05
DEE RAY What, what is that about, your anxiety? 

00:57:05
SINEM Um, as I've been doing, uh, nondirective and, uh, CCPT so far, it just feels like it's gonna be something, I don't know, like, wrong to do. 

00:57:20
DEE RAY So if you wanna do something different and it's not in the book, it would be wrong. 

00:57:25
SINEM Yeah. 

00:57:25
DEE RAY Like, do you think something bad would happen? Or it just? 

00:57:30
SINEM Yeah, I know that it's not gonna be bad, uh, because I've been doing activity therapy with teenagers, so it's gonna be similar to that, but I don't want to be too pushy. I want to, um, I want to make sure that I have better, I have good sense of what he needs at that moment because I really value, uh, being nondirective and letting him to express or, himself when he's ready, but at the same time I want to be able to let him know that I'm willing to learn more. So just balancing those two parts. 

00:58:00
DEE RAY Do you really, do you value that you, what you've learned about him so far through the nonverbal way and, but it just feels, uh, limiting to you in a way? So, but you just, so the first time balancing, that's gonna be tough. That's gonna be really tough. 

00:58:15
SINEM Yes. 

00:58:20
DEE RAY Yeah, moving into that more "hey, let's do something" gear. 

00:58:20
SINEM Yeah. Uh, and I, I told him in the beginning, you know, our first session, that sometimes I would bring, uh, something to do together. Sometimes he will do something that he wants. So he knows that it may come up like I, I may bring up something or ask him to do something. So I don't think it's gonna be inconsistent that way, but I haven't been doing anything like that so far, so I don't know what kind of reaction I'm gonna get and. 

00:58:50
DEE RAY Including like, you don't even know how anxious you're gonna come across and, and will that kind of take place in the session a little, that feeling being in the session too. 

00:59:00
SINEM Yeah. 

00:59:00
DEE RAY Yeah, so now you've been working through it for you, and then you're not sure if it would be for him. 

00:59:05
SINEM Yeah, that's why it's so important for me to process it in here to deal with my anxiety, um. 

00:59:15
DEE RAY But it does sound to me like you have a clear plan of why you wanna do this, that it fits in with, you know, you wanna conceptualize the family, you feel like you're limited in that knowledge, and you wanna try something that will kind of bring out his perceptions. 

00:59:30
SINEM Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And in addition to learning more, I will feel like, um, because he doesn't really initiate communication in his life in general, I think it will be more encouraging for him to see that I'm willing to communicate with him by, um, learning more from him maybe to encourage him to be verbal with me and maybe, you know, playing more in the playroom. Just the relationship part is also, um. 

01:00:00
DEE RAY You know, it seems like you've really spent some time thinking about this and you're being very intentional in, in your approach. I have to ask you one question just to make sure, have you been trained to do the kinetic family drawing? 

01:00:10
SINEM Uh, yeah, I have. I know how to do it, and I have been trained, so, um, but I'm gonna do it in this kind of context. 

01:00:25
DEE RAY You haven't done it in play therapy yet, but you've been trained, you've been practiced with some kids? 

01:00:25
SINEM Yeah. 

01:00:30
DEE RAY Yeah. Okay. So you're gonna be prepared then to do it. Well, what do you think about, um, maybe after your, after you do the session, about us sitting down and, and looking at it and seeing how it went, talking about how you felt about it? 

01:00:45
SINEM It will be really helpful, yeah. And it's gonna be a big step for me, even though I'm not planning to do, you know, activities throughout the whole session, it's gonna be a part of the session, uh, but still I think I'm gonna be anxious at some level and I, I will appreciate just talking about it afterwards. 

01:01:00
DEE RAY Yeah. So let's plan to do that, 'cuz you were gonna do that this week, is that? And so this time next week we'll, we'll sit down and look at it and see how it went? 

01:01:10
SINEM Yes, it will be good. 

01:01:10
Session with Katie 

01:01:15
KATIE Well, um, I have, you know, my little 7-year-old boy that I'm seeing. He's, well, still having all these problems at school acting out, um, like hitting other kids when they try to take a toy from him. And, um, he's been sent to the principle like, almost every day because he's just not using socially appropriate skills. And, um, and I mean, I've seen some of that in the playroom, but not really a lot. Like, he's usually pretty, just does kind of what he wants, a little bit of aggression, but usually not directed toward me or anger at me. Um, and then his parents, we had a parent consultation, and his dad is really frustrated with his lack of progress in play therapy and, um, was talking to me about some, um, different parenting resources and research that he read talking about, like teaching social skills. And I really think, I mean, I think he's working in the playroom, but I don't know. 

01:02:25
DEE RAY Like you're not sure? 

01:02:25
KATIE It seems like, I mean, maybe I, maybe I should be helping him 'cuz he's not working on that problem in the playroom. 

01:02:35
DEE RAY So you're thinking some of the things that the dad mentioned actually might be helpful to him? 

01:02:40
KATIE Yeah, like, I mean, if no one ever teaches him how to say "please" or "that's mine" or "I had that first" or tell the teacher. 

01:02:55
DEE RAY Then who's gonna do it? Right, yeah. 

01:02:55
KATIE And, I mean, I, I guess I do believe in the child, that they can bring themselves under control, but at the same time, I'm afraid the parents are just gonna pull him out. 

01:03:05
DEE RAY Yeah. And that's always a risk. The parents might decide this isn't working, we're gonna go. Um, I'm interested because, you know, we've been in supervision a long time together and you're actually one of the people I would say seems the most aligned with child-centered play therapy and, and, and if you're saying just hearing you say "I guess I believe" it, it, it's interesting hearing that tone in your voice. It's not something I've heard from you before. Not that it wouldn't be fine. You know, you have cohorts who're not child-centered, but it seems so different from our experiences in here together. 

01:03:45
KATIE Yeah, I guess, I guess I'm just feeling stuck because he's not, because his parents are feeling so frustrated with him, and like I don't know what to do. And I've tried explaining to them that it's a process and it takes a while, but still they don't really, they don't really seem to get it. And, and I do believe that if he stayed in play therapy long enough that he will able to work some of these things out and, for himself, and that that's what's most helpful for him, but at the same time, the parents are, if they pull him out, I can't help him. 

01:04:25
DEE RAY So you feel like things need to move quicker than they are. 

01:04:25
KATIE Yeah. 

01:04:25
DEE RAY Okay. And that's a lot of pressure for you. 

01:04:30
KATIE Yeah. 

01:04:30
DEE RAY Yeah. 

01:04:35
KATIE Yeah, I'm feeling pretty, I don't know, maybe I'm just doing something wrong or, I don't know. 

01:04:45
DEE RAY So now, you think maybe he's not moving quickly enough because you're doing something wrong in the playroom? 

01:04:50
KATIE Yeah, maybe. 

01:04:50
DEE RAY Okay. 

01:04:55
KATIE Maybe if I can be more something. I don't know, I guess it just, like, all the, all the parents' concerns or complaints kind of, but with this kid, with other kids I don't struggle with this, but with him it seems like maybe he's, it's not working. 

01:05:10
DEE RAY And I am wondering about this case because you certainly had tougher cases, um, and I'm also hearing you question kind of some of your beliefs, then I'm hearing this added piece of your questioning you like, I need to be more in the playroom, um, see if you can go any deeper, what, what is it about this case that really is getting to you? 

01:05:40
KATIE Um, I guess I feel like I've been successful in the other ones. But in this one I'm not. 

01:05:50
DEE RAY So if he's not better within whatever the time is for the parents, then it's time for you to start questioning yourself and your abilities? 

01:06:00
KATIE Yeah, I guess so. That doesn't. 

01:06:05
DEE RAY Yeah, 'cuz like, on your face! It, it doesn't make sense? 

01:06:10
KATIE I mean, it makes sense. That's how I'm feeling. It doesn't seem logical. 

01:06:10
DEE RAY Yeah. 

01:06:15
KATIE Like why would one kid cause me to question everything that I, if I believe it and I've seen it work with all these others. 

01:06:20
DEE RAY So that's your answer to that question. 

01:06:25
KATIE I mean, it sounds easy. Keep trusting the process, and, I mean, I guess I have to be okay if they choose not to keep him here. 

01:06:40
DEE RAY But even that doesn't sound like you really believe that. 

01:06:40
KATIE It still feels like I'm the one who failed. 

01:06:45
DEE RAY That you're the one who failed. 

01:06:45
KATIE Yeah. 

01:06:50
DEE RAY And I do wonder, you know, so much of what we do is about that unconditional positive regard, um, and feeling that you have, you don't have a lot of it for you. 

01:07:05
KATIE Yeah, that's true. 

01:07:10
DEE RAY You kind of leaned back when I said that. 

01:07:15
KATIE Yeah, I guess I feel like I, like, can I really be enough because that's what child-centered is about is the therapist is such a big part in the relationship so is that really enough for me to really provide? 

01:07:25
DEE RAY Yeah. 

01:07:25
KATIE Can, can I be enough, right. Other, I believe other people can do it, but am I enough? 

01:07:35
DEE RAY Well, let's ask this: is he enough? 

01:07:40
KATIE The child? Yeah. I, I believe that. 

01:07:45
DEE RAY So he's enough, but possibly you're not enough? I, I think I struggle when I'm in play when I go certain times of self-doubt and really giving all that I can give to the child. So like for this case, um, if I'm doubting myself, then it makes it harder for me to have, stick with that belief system that he is enough. So I'm thinking there's more that needs to be done here, more that has to happen, more that I should do, not, you know, more, more that I should be doing. And in a way. 

01:08:30
KATIE I guess that reflects on him, not really, or my belief that he's not enough to, that he doesn't have enough to, to (inaudible ). 

01:08:41
DEE RAY Which, and that's the question that we all have to figure out when we're working with kids is, and that's what kind of separates CCPT from other theories is, and it's okay to think that a child needs something different or something done more, um, but CCPT is more about that the child is enough. 

01:09:05
KATIE Yeah. And really trusting. I don't know how to get to a place where I do really trust him, though. Like, I guess I can say that I do, but maybe I'm really, I thought I was, but, you know, maybe I'm not, I'm feeling like I have to do this and I need to provide this kind of direction. 

01:09:35
DEE RAY I'm, I'm questioning the relationship between your trust for him and your trust for you. Are those related? 

01:09:50
KATIE Yeah, I think I, if I'm not trusting myself, it's harder to trust him. 

01:10:00
DEE RAY So now we've reached stage four and, like in all developmental models, the supervisee is moving to become an equal to the supervisor. This is the place where we are now engaging with supervision with a colleague and we will talk about what that looks like. 

01:10:15
Stage 4: Person of Play Therapist Emerges as a Professional Supervisee Dynamics in Supervision Supervision transitions into consultation Initiated by supervisee Led by supervisee-concerns typically related to person of play therapist or specific play therapy relationship Unconditioned positive self-regard becomes a focus If non-CCPT, supervisee seeking training or supervisor experiences aligned with new current philosophy; uses previous CCPT supervisor as consultant 

01:10:15
DEE RAY So the dynamics in supervision, first of all, the supervision transitions into consultation. It really should be viewed more as a consultation model. It's initiated by the supervisee, so usually supervision itself, they will arrange when it's going to be, they will initiate what they wanna talk about in supervision. It is led by them and their concerns, and what we usually I find is what their concerns are related to the person of the play therapist or the relationship in play therapy. So often our supervision sessions or consultation sessions are this processing of what's going on with the play therapist, with the counselor and how are they relating to their client, what does this mean for their relationship with the client. Often it, what becomes the focus is unconditional positive self-regard. Are they accepting themselves? Can they fully accept themselves so they can fully accept their clients? And this becomes a huge focus of supervision. If they are not child-centered play therapists, the supervisee is seeking training, usually initiated by themselves and they are, they'll find that they are aligned with this new current philosophy, but they're using the child-centered play therapist supervisor as a consultant, as somebody to come to and talk about these new ways of working and how it fits with who they are. So the child-centered play therapist supervisor still has a role at this stage. 

01:11:40
DEE RAY Now this is the really fun stage where you get to see the supervisee become their own person in play therapy. And what happens is they start reporting and you start seeing regular encounters of being in the moment in the play therapy session. 

01:11:55
Stage 4: Person of Play Therapist Emerges as a Professional Supervisee Dynamics in Play Therapy Session Regular encounters of being in the moment in session Empathic understanding and unconditional positive regard expressed in an uncensored way Conceptualization stems from accurate empathic understanding Confidence emerges from sense of authenticity 

01:11:55
DEE RAY These really connected moments between therapist and child that is apparent, um, in observation, but very much experienced by the counselor. The empathic understanding and unconditional positive regard are start, are being expressed in uncensored ways. They are no longer using just phrases that they were given, but they are using phrases that are coming from themselves that are fully integrated into who they are. And then their conceptualization of the client becomes stronger because it's coming from accurate empathic understanding of the client. They really get the client now. Their own processes are no longer getting in the way, and so they are able to really understand what's going on with the client. And then you start to see them become more confident and they emerge with this sense of authenticity that just continues to grow and makes supervision a lot of fun. 

01:12:45
DEE RAY It is in this stage four that the supervisor is fully experiencing themselves in the relationship with the supervisee. They are also experiencing intense levels congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathic understanding that is mutual between them. 

01:13:00
Stage 4: Person of Play Therapist Emerges as a Professional Supervisor Attitudinal Qualities Intense levels of mutual expression of congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathic understanding by both supervisor and supervisee Recognition of the effect of limited unconditional positive self-regard on offering unconditional positive regard clients 

01:13:00
DEE RAY That's a really fun relationship to be in. It's a connective relationship. It's a very present relationship. And so we're now operating as equals. And also the supervisor is recognizing their own limitations of unconditional positive self-regard and as their working with the supervisee on their limitations of unconditional positive self-regard. A lot of parallel process taking place here. 

01:13:25
DEE RAY So what does this look like for the supervisor in stage four? What are they doing in supervision? Well, first of all, they're sharing their genuine reactions to the child, to the play therapy session, and to the supervisee. 

01:13:35
Stage 4 Supervisor Actions Sharing of genuine reactions to child, session, and supervisee External processing of unprocessed thoughts with supervisee Supporting supervisee's movement to a personal approach of doing play therapy Letting go of any possible control needs 

01:13:35
DEE RAY It's all very congruent and just sharing what's coming up for them as the supervision session takes place. There's an external processing of unpre-, unprocessed thoughts with supervisee. What I mean by this, it sounds kind of confusing, but what I'm saying is that I'm now starting to bring things into supervision that maybe I experienced at the beginning levels, at stage one, stage two, maybe about their growth, how, my reaction to their growth, how I'm feeling now with them, that we're now really in this relationship equally. Um, I'm supporting the supervisee's movement to a personal approach of doing play therapy. We are not stuck in a theory, um, driven, it can be theory-guided, and I want it to be theory-guided, but not theory-driven and limited by theory. The, the supervisee has now integrated theory into who they are and I'm supporting that. And, for me, I don't know if anybody else has this issue, but I'm letting go of my control needs. I'm letting the supervi-, I can see the supervisee is ready, um, moving into being more independent, and I need to let go of, this is the way I would do it, um, that they are now able to make their own decisions about that. 

01:14:45
DEE RAY For stage four I'd like to introduce Kimberly. Kimberly is clearly in the stage four process, and you can see her leading our session and me following and really just being who I am in session, a very real moment between the two of us. In fact, I'll just share a personal thing here, when the video camera went off, we went further into the supervision session and, um, although we were talking about a fictional client, we did hit on some real things. And so I think that's pretty typical for stage four, and I think this is a good roleplay of that. 

01:15:20
Dee RayYou will notice that Kimberly enters supervision with a clear idea of what she needs and what she needs to process. She shows her video first and then initiates her own process. As supervisor, I'm now clearly in the consultant role, serving as a sounding board and an engaged equal in her process. 

01:15:35
KIMBERLY So yeah, so just watching her, even then I kind of realized something I seemed to be picking up in session is she seems to be doing a lot of nurturing, um, play, both towards the dolls and kind of her, and then towards me too, um. 

01:15:50
DEE RAY That, like when she went and got the doll and was feeding it. 

01:15:55
KIMBERLY Yeah, and putting Band-Aids on it, um. 

01:15:55
DEE RAY Okay. Yeah, I thought that looked like that too. 

01:16:00
KIMBERLY But it seems like it, 'cuz she like, at first she started to do it by herself and then she brought the doll to me and kind of wanted me to participate and hold the doll and, and wanted me to, first she told me I was the mother and that she was the doctor taking care of the baby who was sick, but then she kind of switched it and said, you know, I'm the mother, you're the doctor, um, and kind of did this back and forth thing. I wasn't really sure. 

01:16:20
DEE RAY Almost like she was confused on that? 

01:16:25
KIMBERLY Yeah, or like there was something within her that wanted to be kind of more of the mother but then didn't want to be it or, and it, it almost seemed like she wasn't sure which, like if she could almost trust me to take care of the baby enough, so she needed to do both roles and she needed to be the mother and the doctor, but still wanted me to, to kind of be part of it too. 

01:16:45
DEE RAY Yeah. 

01:16:45
KIMBERLY Um. 

01:16:45
DEE RAY And when you say that your eyes kind of, I don't know, they had something in them. 

01:16:50
KIMBERLY Yeah, it just, um, I think I'm feeling this kind of pulled towards her just 'cuz I know that her mother hasn't been in her life the way that she's needed, and so wanting to be really responsive to that, like what is she needing from me, um. 

01:17:05
DEE RAY Making sure that you're able to provide that to her and being sensitive to that. 

01:17:10
KIMBERLY Yeah, and her need for that kind of nurturing but also to kind of work out what that means for her and I'm going to not, like, assume too much, and I think sometimes I do that. Like sometimes I'm like, expecting her to be more angry towards me, um, or even, uh, yeah. And so sometimes I'm like, oh, what's gonna be coming from this, and then she doesn't really respond the way I expect. Or maybe expecting her to feel more sad than she does in the moment, um, especially around the nurturing play 'cuz it seems like I've been more aware of that. 

01:17:40
DEE RAY You've been more aware of your feelings or of what's going on with her? 

01:17:45
KIMBERLY I think I've just been more, like, the nurturing thing has just stood out for me because I know about her history. And so that's when I'm like, am I paying too much attention to this and not to other things that are happening in the session, but it does seem significant for her. 

01:18:00
DEE RAY So almost like you're like, overly sensitive to her. Yeah. And maybe projecting? Is that what you're talking about? 

01:18:05
KimberlyYeah, possibly. Like, I think I'm worried that I might be projecting or that I might have expectations for her, um, just because I know, you know, that her mother hasn't been there and that has been, it's been really hard for her. Um. 

01:18:20
DEE RAY And you wanna be that for her. 

01:18:25
KIMBERLY Yeah, I think I do. I think I want to be supportive. And I know I can't repair or be her mother, but I do have this kind of like, pull towards her of wanting to give that care and support that she needs. Um, yeah, so it's complicated for me, um, especially, I think it becomes more confusing when she's kind of confused about the roles. Like sometimes it would be easier if she did kind of separate me for a minute or if she didn't' fully include me, but it's the back and forth. And I've even noticed that like in how she uses the space in our sessions, like it seems like she'll come and be really close to me in her play, even not around the nurturing stuff but just in general, but then move away and try to be really sensitive about that dynamic and also within myself at times when I feel like I wanna come towards her or, um, or feeling like I'm kind of holding back a little bit. 

01:19:15
DEE RAY And almost when you're talking it sounds like you, your confusion reflects her confusion? 

01:19:20
KIMBERLY Yeah, I think so. (inaudible ), you know, that it is confusing. Um, and I don't know that I know what role I'm supposed to play, um, for her. I mean, I know I'm her therapist, but just what that means of rher in our sessions like what she needs from me. 

01:19:35
DEE RAY So where do you wanna go with that? I mean, it's pretty deep insight into like, what's going on there. 

01:19:45
KIMBERLY Um, I think I'm trying to be aware of kind of, um, my own need to nurture, like that's really strong for me, and so not wanting to rescue her and not wanting to jump in too quickly, wanting to communicate that I believe in her ability to work things out and, and trust her in that. And then also, I know, knowing the pain that she's experienced in her relationship with her mother kind of brings up some of my own experiences, you know, in my childhood and with my parents, and so trying to be aware of it but not letting it get in the way of trying to really be present for her or putting my stuff onto her, um, 'cuz her experience is really different from mine and I don't want that confusion to be happening for me in session. 

01:20:30
DEE RAY And I guess I'm reacting to the fine line of that of, of how much do you provide for her versus, you know, how much is it coming from you, I don't know, just from a child-centered way of looking at it, I guess, that seems confusing for me even to talk about it at all. What, can you find that line? Do you know where it is? 

01:20:50
KIMBERLY Yeah, I don't think you can. I think it, I'm just really aware of it and trying to be really sensitive to her process and knowing what that brings up for me, um, and using who I am 'cuz I don't think the nurturing is neg-, completely negative or coming from a bad place, to being able to be open to that part of myself and giving it to her, but also not in a way that is more about me, um, needing her to help, needing her help for me or needing me to, what, what am I trying to say? Needing to feel like I'm helping her. Like that it's not coming from that place as much as genuinely responding to her in the moment. 

01:21:30
DEE RAY What she really does need from you instead of what you need to give her. 

01:21:35
KIMBERLY Right, exactly. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. So it is kind of blurry, um. 

01:21:40
DEE RAY But it also sounds like you've spent a lot of time thinking about it and balancing it and trying to figure it out? 

01:21:45
KIMBERLY Yeah, I definitely spent a lot of time thinking about her and our time together and kind of trying to look at my sessions and see where that's happening for me or being aware of what feeling happens for me when she is in close proximity and trying to be sensitive to what she's feeling in that moment and kind of balancing those two things. So kind of aware of my processing and hers at the same time. 

01:22:10
DEE RAY And be in the moment. 

01:22:10
KIMBERLY Yeah. That's hard. 

01:22:15
DEE RAY It is. 

01:22:15
KIMBERLY And sometimes I have to let go of that. I mean, I, you can think about it later, just be here right now and give what you have to give, um. 

01:22:25
DEE RAY So how are you approaching that, then, in terms of what's going on with you in the room and what's going on outside the room? 

01:22:30
KIMBERLY Uh, I think in the room, like when I realize I'm like, too inside my head or too like, trying to analyze it too much or something, um, I just try to go and be aware that that's happening and go, wait a minute, let's put that off, let's be really attuned and try to, um, kind of bring myself back in the moment by noticing either something physical that's going on like, um, or, you know, reflecting some feeling that I'm seeing inside of her, just even reflecting her play, just so that I get back right quickly into it and I can make contact with her again. Um, and then outside the session, just, um, trying to give myself a little bit of a break 'cuz I know sometimes I'm being too critical about it like, um, and trying to trust myself a little more, like that I'm responding to her, um. 

01:23:20
DEE RAY And that that's happening naturally for you, that that, you know, and I just wanna say I know you, our relationship, that's something I really trust in you is that that's natural for you to, to go with this balance and, to me it'd be hard for me to imagine being in a situation where you're not, um, just in tune with the child and, because that is such a high priority for you. I imagine you bring in the stuff from your past and you work with all of that and it seems like you have a really good balance in trying to look at where that sits versus where your relationship with the child sits. 

01:24:00
KIMBERLY Yeah, it's hard for me to trust that, like, um, to believe that it will just kind of come naturally, that I have that, that I don't have to work so hard at it. Um. 

01:24:10
DEE RAY That's the part that, just having part of your self-acceptance. 

01:24:15
KIMBERLY Yeah. Yeah, 'cuz I feel like I have to, I'm so hyper-vigilant about it, almost to a fault that it sometimes actually gets in my way, um, and I just need to kind of trust myself and trust, um. You know, I trust her, I trust the child, but I think the part or, that's harder for me in our relationship is trusting myself to respond. 

01:24:35
DEE RAY Definitely, definitely true for me too. 

01:24:35
KIMBERLY Yeah. 

01:24:35
DEE RAY Well, in this process, what, um, you know, like I said, I just feel so comfortable with your approach and what you're doing in the room, is there anything, or what do you need from me, or what do you see as my role in helping you? 

01:24:50
KIMBERLY Well, just talking, you know, talk it out and not just be holding it within myself is really helpful, um, kind of give a voice to it outside of myself, kinda help me see it, and also kinda help me kind of relax about it a little bit, um, 'cuz I think it's been more weighing on me heavily, more heavily than I even realized. So just making me feel. 

01:25:10
DEE RAY So it's in your head you're, you know, you're seeing this phase when you start to say it out loud. 

01:25:15
KIMBERLY Yeah, and so, so that was real-, just even being able to see it that way. And I think, um, it's helpful to have your perspective like how you kind of see me and be able to take that in as well, uh, than just seeing it myself. But I think just being able to process it, about it, um, and kind of talk about when that is coming up with, with me, and then I think even watching the sessions and being able to see, like, this is the moment when I was really feeling pulled or confused, um, like, what is that looking like and kind of processing. 

01:25:45
DEE RAY And so that's something (inaudible ). 

01:25:50
KIMBERLY Yeah, like, do you see it, or what are you noticing that I'm not able to see, and so that's helpful, um, just to know that I can, that we can look at it together and go, this is a moment when I was feeling really, like I wanted to take care of her, and how is that translating in how I'm responding to her, and what's going on with her, kind of thing. 

01:26:10
DEE RAY So just continuing to process though. 

01:26:10
KIMBERLY Yeah. 

01:26:15
DEE RAY So in closing, I hope that these role plays and this explanation has been beneficial to you, and I hope what you really see is how we use our attitudinal qualities; I'm going to say them again: empathic understanding, congruence, and unconditional positive regard, in relationship to the developmental level of the supervisee and how the more we can share those and facilitate the experience of a supervisee, the more they take that on, grow, move in their development, and are able to provide the same things for their clients: the goal we want in play therapy supervision.
