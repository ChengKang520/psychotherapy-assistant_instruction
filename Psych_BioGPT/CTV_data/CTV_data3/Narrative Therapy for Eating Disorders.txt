Ali Borden, MFT 

00:00:55
ALI BORDEN There's a lot of ideas out there about what these problems are about like, we've all heard them. I, I can't tell you how many will walk up to me in my life and say, "But it's all about control isn't it?" Uhm, ah, and there's-- similarly I have plenty of clients that come in and go, "I know this is me and my need for control." 

00:01:10
Larry Zucker, LCSW 

00:01:10
ALI BORDEN There's also the ideas that, that-- feminist ideas about you know, trying to approximate the... 

00:01:15
LARRY ZUCKER An unattainable standard of beauty kind? 

00:01:15
ALI BORDEN Yeah, exactly. In idealized forms and that, that it's impossible and, uhm, self-esteem and there's a, there's a million ideas out there about what this already is. None of which are necessarily untrue, they're just too giant, number one. And number two, they ar-- if you arrive at them before clients then it feels like they're, they're, they're like hitting someone over the head with, ah, cajole that they want to defend against. I went-- if they said it's about control I don't go straight at I need to, ah, but I'm curious about it. I just think that's not a rich enough description for what's actually going on. It's a little bit like, have you ever gone into the store and e-- you and I both wore glasses when, ah, go into the store and bought those ones you can buy in Rite Aid. 

00:01:55
LARRY ZUCKER Yeah. 

00:01:55
ALI BORDEN There, they don't-- they're, they're better but they're not great. And I almost feel like I wanna be the optician who goes better here, better here until the end. It's so subtle when they turn it, that the difference is... 

00:02:05
LARRY ZUCKER That you can't tell the difference cuz, you know... 

00:02:05
ALI BORDEN Yeah, exactly because-- but then it's so your prescription that it's subtle and, and specific as opposed to something general that is not untrue but is also not a, a really nice fit. And that if you are slow enough in conversation what do you mean by control. What, you know, let's, ah, ask some more questions about that, what ideas are there about control in the world, what kinds of ideas they had in your family about control and suddenly there's gonna be a new word. Control isn't actually gonna be the only word in the conversation. They're gonna come up with something about. "I like to have authority" and now we're talking about something else. Or, "I like things to go the way I planned" or "I really care about certain things but don't care about other things" like-- and all of a sudden we're in a much richer conversation and control have been left back by the wayside. 

00:02:55
LARRY ZUCKER So it sounds like the problem that you have with therapists that are over committed to a pre-existing story. 

00:03:00
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:03:00
LARRY ZUCKER It's just that it's one story and that it's pre-existing. 

00:03:05
ALI BORDEN Yup. 

00:03:05
LARRY ZUCKER It like, there's, there's nothing wrong with that set of ideas 

00:03:05
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:03:05
LARRY ZUCKER It might very much fit the client's experience, it might not but if the therapist leads with it at the very least it's gonna be reductionistic. 

00:03:15
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:03:15
LARRY ZUCKER And it's also likely gonna lead to a struggle over it is, it isn't, it is, it isn't. 

00:03:20
ALI BORDEN Yeah, yeah. 

00:03:20
LARRY ZUCKER You're bringing a generalization that it might managed but they might not be. They might have gotten from a former therapist, they might have felt like they created themselves. 

00:03:25
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:03:25
LARRY ZUCKER But to you it's still Walgreens' classes - 

00:03:30
ALI BORDEN Yup, exactly. 

00:03:30
LARRY ZUCKER - until you've had the chance to have much more conversation with them about the details - 

00:03:35
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:03:35
LARRY ZUCKER - of their experience. 

00:03:35
ALI BORDEN I think the details are gonna lead us to the richness of, of what they want and their preferences and what was in line with them and what wasn't and the kind of things they dream about and it's-- that specificity is actually gonna give them the gas to be able to drive from here to the next thing. 

00:04:00
2 Diagnosis is NOT a useful concept around which to organize the conversation or develop the goals of therapy Anorexia is not a useful description Diagnosis is only a description of behaviors Leaves out what clients would prefer or dream of Diagnosis brings assumptions what needs to be done Eliminating behaviors is not a good enough motivator Search for "Here is what I want for my life" Hopes and dreams direct goals of therapy 

00:04:05
ALI BORDEN I believe that the diagnosis of anorexia is just a very general concept clinically. It's almost not that useful because it is so generic. It's, it's basically a description of behaviors and it's not a rich description of want people are actually experiencing. It says what they're doing but it's not saying what they feel or why. And it's not even coming close to saying what they actually are trying to move towards or what they would prefer or what they dream for their lives. So unfortunately the diagnosis brings with it a lot of assumptions about what clients are feeling and what they need to do and whatever-- and what clinicians should be doing. An urgency in fear from parents and loved one who are like, this is where people need to go and here's-- we all know what these goals are and how to get there. Weight gain, cessation of behaviors, all those kinds of things and, and certain mental health standards. But that doesn't actually-- that's not a good motivator for clients. Client need to be able to articulate, "Here's what's actually happening for me. Here's how come I'm caught up in these ideas and these behaviors." And a whole separate conversation about, "Here's what I want for my life, here's what I dream of, here's what it would look like" which is not necessarily the opposite of even the diagnosis. It may not be will I wanna have self-esteem, it's sort of like, "I wish that I had friends, had a job that I dream of." And then you can a conversation about, well how are these ideas that are associated with your eating or these behaviors getting a way of those goals. That's a different conversation than just the narrow thing that we get stuck in about you have a diagnosis, I know what that means so I know what we need to do is to get rid of that diagnosis. That's not, that's not an-- it's not rich enough for anybody to start a conversation with. 

00:05:50
Rivka 

00:05:50
RIVKA I had a trouble getting diagnosed initially because my doctor was like, "You're not the type to be anorexic. You're too smart to be anorexic." 

00:06:00
ALI BORDEN Mmm. 

00:06:00
RIVKA And so I think it wasn't super helpful for me cuz I was... 

00:06:00
ALI BORDEN No. 

00:06:05
RIVKA I was like, okay well, clearly I am dishonest. Even when I got diagnosed she didn't believe it. 

00:06:10
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:06:10
RIVKA Even when I was admitted into the hospital. She's like, "Well you're really underweight and stuff, that you're not anorexic but I'll help you to gain weight to be there". 

00:06:15
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:06:15
RIVKA And so that roughly was a confused-- I was really confused by that - 

00:06:20
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:06:20
RIVKA - especially cuz I was confused anyway - 

00:06:20
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:06:20
RIVKA - by my house to the hospital. When my doctor doesn't think I'm anorexic, I'm just skinny. 

00:06:25
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh, yeah. 

00:06:30
RIVKA Uhm, so I think that she had an idea what anorexia was. 

00:06:30
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:06:30
RIVKA A fear at which she didn't help me. And then the psychiatrist that I mentioned before, uhm, I saw him as a private client for years into my practice and that was not helpful at all and one of the reasons was, uhm, he could not remember a single thing about me that was not aligned with like, a case study of anorexia nervosa. 

00:06:55
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:06:55
RIVKA Uhm, if I, if I mentioned anything that was different - 

00:07:00
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:07:00
RIVKA - he just would not remember it. 

00:07:00
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:07:00
RIVKA And, and, and made me become more like that - 

00:07:05
ALI BORDEN Mmm. 

00:07:05
RIVKA - because I thought, "Oh, that's what I'm supposed to be." So I almost, uhm, molding myself into more of a case study. 

00:07:10
ALI BORDEN To fitting the diagnosis in some way. 

00:07:10
RIVKA Yes. It almost felt like a privilege to be there like I won something. But in a... 

00:07:15
ALI BORDEN Uh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Like you achieved this diagnosis in some kind of way. Mm-hmm. 

00:07:20
RIVKA Yeah, but in not a very helpful way to me. 

00:07:20
ALI BORDEN Yeah, you don't think that was useful in recov-- 

00:07:20
RIVKA No. 

00:07:25
ALI BORDEN You're like, get-- you're go-- moving on with your life. 

00:07:25
RIVKA Not at all. 

00:07:25
ALI BORDEN So, so it sounds like there were a bunch of different ideas about what anorexia was and whether you fit or whether you didn't fit. And that sounds like it influenced how you thought about yourself and whether you fit or didn't fit and it also sounds like maybe competition came into it like, uhm, - 

00:07:40
RIVKA Uh-hmm. 

00:07:40
ALI BORDEN -or comparison or like-- this, - 

00:07:40
RIVKA Yeah. 

00:07:40
ALI BORDEN - am I this, am I not that, that kind of thing. 

00:07:45
RIVKA And I would say that also happened from reading things on anorexia - 

00:07:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:07:45
RIVKA - because I read things and it'll be like, you she only-- this many calories or she wouldn't eat that and I'd be like, "Oh my God, I'm really not doing a good enough job because I have eaten that." 

00:07:55
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh, yeah. 

00:07:55
RIVKA You know, or I think that, uhm, when, when someone's in that like anorexic mindset it's, it's like you're looking for-- or I was looking for things to prove that I wasn't good enough - 

00:08:05
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:08:05
RIVKA - and we're looking for ways to do it better. 

00:08:10
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:08:10
RIVKA And so I-- the media or literature or doctors, therapists were all sources of that for me. 

00:08:15
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. About trying to do it better - 

00:08:15
RIVKA Yeah. 

00:08:20
ALI BORDEN - anorexia style like, ah, the... 

00:08:25
3 Making the distinction between diagnosis and medical jeopardy Many clients meet criteria for anorexia but are not in medical jeopardy As long as a client is medically stable we should be interested in the client's goals Attempts to eliminate behaviors are not strong motivators for change Gains more likely to be sustained if they are based of client's goals 

00:08:30
ALI BORDEN Once I think you have settled the question medical jeopardy then I think clinicians have a lot more options than they realize. If somebody is in medical jeopardy, acute medical jeopardy, they need to go to a hospital. But above that they may still be clearly diagnosable below the body weight percentage that leads them in the category of anorexia or having acute behaviors with anor-- with bulimia. Those are all clearly problematic but we as clinicians have an opportunity there to talk with clients about what they want. We have some time there to figure out what are we doing here, what are we heading towards that we often miss if we think, "I have to get this person better." It's obvious what they need to do. They need to gain weight or they need to stop bending and purging or whatever they need to do. So we just need to see how to get them to do that. Then we missed the space for curiosity about what are you after, what makes this worthwhile? That's a way more interesting conversation and way more likely to, to s-- to be, ah, for our client to be able to sustain than just the absence of behaviors. 

00:09:40
ALI BORDEN So how did you, how-- do you know how that was conveyed? What-- how did you feel like you had a voice in the process? Did you feel like they didn't have any investment or, or we didn't have any investment at all in where you were going? How, how did you... 

00:09:50
Tessa 

00:09:50
TESSA Yeah, I felt like you guys really cared about not ju-- I mean obviously not about me getting healthy and like, me, I'm gonna eat and like my vitals being saved and everything. But you guys asked questions about like, I mean people start to ask me about who I was and like looking at what I valued and what I felt was important and what I wanted you know, like outside of the eating disorder and you even helped start to build that life even though we were still-- I was still in treatment, still working on my eat disorder so really, I'm struggling with it. Uhm, you started doing them both, like I'll never forget-- I think it was you, the metaphor of like as the angels or that in life and like when the east end goes, ah, goes, goes down a little bit the light comes a little bit. It's like this shifting of the weights. 

00:10:30
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:10:30
TESSA And that's when it started while opposed to like, other places. I felt-- like the message that was conveyed to me was you have to get the-- in, you sort of fix before you can start to build the life. 

00:10:40
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. 

00:10:40
TESSA And that was really scary because some people have a life I guess they can jump back into it like their eating disorders recently pull them out of. I didn't feel like I really have that like I didn't know what I was jumping towards. 

00:10:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:10:50
TESSA So to let go of the one thing and jump towards the other thing. 

00:10:55
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:10:55
TESSA It was like there wasn't anything. I didn't have a group of friends to return to, I didn't have a school, I didn't have a job, I didn't have this community, this life that I had been taken out of, that I could really remember and missed. 

00:11:05
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:11:05
TESSA And so having a chance to be working on eating disorder while I was starting to put that, like, ground work down for my life - 

00:11:15
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:11:15
TESSA - really helped and I feel like you guys cared about that. 

00:11:15
ALI BORDEN About building that life. 

00:11:20
TESSA Building that life - 

00:11:20
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:11:20
TESSA - by giving me, giving me ideas of what it was I-- not ideas but helped me find out what it was I wanted. 

00:11:25
ALI BORDEN Was there confusion about whether you still wanted to go back to the old patterns of the eating disorder or would, uhm, you just... 

00:11:30
TESSA Was there confusion for me or for you? 

00:11:35
ALI BORDEN Yeah, for you. Like were you, were you torn at times. Did you know I wanna get better or were you torn. 

00:11:40
TESSA No, I knew I wanted to get better, I knew that. 

00:11:40
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. 

00:11:45
TESSA Uhm, where I got torn was like I was really scared - 

00:11:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:11:45
TESSA - like I knew I wanna. I always knew I wanted to even when I've like, reread journals. I can read in there that I always really wanted to, like I knew it wasn't like, bs'ing that part - 

00:11:55
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:11:55
TESSA - but sometimes other places made me think I want. I didn't really want to because I wasn't able to get past my fears or anything so I started to doubt myself but I really did want to. I just didn't feel like I knew how and I' was really-- I'm just really, really scared. 

00:12:10
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:12:10
TESSA And so, uhm, I, uhm, and I think one of the biggest things was that you guys asked questions. Once I knew, it just-- I didn't wanna do it as much as anymore because I cared of the other people - 

00:12:20
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:12:20
TESSA - like I had their experience in my head too. And I knew that the effects were-- I could always tell that it was getting me farther away from what I really wanted but I never really knew why. 

00:12:30
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:12:30
TESSA And now I could see why. 

00:12:35
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:12:35
TESSA And I knew it was someone who wanted friends really badly. 

00:12:35
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:12:35
TESSA I wanted relationships, wanna to be able to go, you know, have a group go to the movies and you know, having fun like girl's night and I couldn't see why it wasn't happening and what I was doing was taking me away from that. I could just feel it taking me away from that - 

00:12:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:12:50
TESSA - and then I was able to kind of see it and put it back, link the pieces together. 

00:12:55
ALI BORDEN Gotcha. 

00:13:00
4 Organizing therapy around a client's experience and what they want for their lives Look beyond diagnosis and behaviors Avoid assumptions about recovery Have faith in a client's good intentions Curiosity about what clients want for their lives Search for values and preferences 

00:13:05
ALI BORDEN So I believe it's our job as clinicians to resist getting distracted by diagnosis and descriptions of behaviors and assumptions about where people need to go. Instead, I think it is our job to have faith in our client's good intention and really be curious about what they want for their life and be dedicated in our search for client's own descriptions of their values and preferences in their life. 

00:13:30
LARRY ZUCKER Of your ability to solve slow down the conversation. 

00:13:35
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. 

00:13:35
LARRY ZUCKER Cuz that-- they don't sh-- shall say something you know, that, that some identity conclusion. 

00:13:40
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:13:40
LARRY ZUCKER Yeah, I guess cuz I have a low self-esteem and, and then, and you go, "You're already outweighed but..." 

00:13:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:13:45
LARRY ZUCKER It's like-- and you, and you sort of take, take it apart further. 

00:13:50
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:13:50
LARRY ZUCKER All right, and i-i-it sounds like you, you, you keep interrupting - 

00:13:55
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:13:55
LARRY ZUCKER - the conclusions they draw - 

00:13:55
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:13:55
LARRY ZUCKER - about themselves - 

00:14:00
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:14:00
LARRY ZUCKER - to get richer account of. 

00:14:00
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:14:00
LARRY ZUCKER Yeah, but - 

00:14:00
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:14:00
LARRY ZUCKER - what's that made of and, and what was so-- it gets again, it sounds like you're in pursuit of that good intention. 

00:14:10
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:14:10
LARRY ZUCKER That they have lost track of the account of that intention. 

00:14:10
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. Yeah, for sure. I-- and I, I, I, I definitely believe that it's there and I, I ho-- I, I'm not captured. In fact I'm, I'm-- when I hear generalizations or typical words they feel like they, they're not subtle enough for me so I'm not go-- a-any-- everything feels like it's a temporary placeholder that's probably too general. So, uhm, well I was always this kind of a person or I liked this kind of thing. I'm always thinking that is, that is probably-- not that it's actually incorrect but it's not the whole story. 

00:14:45
LARRY ZUCKER So the word always really triggers you. 

00:14:45
ALI BORDEN Totally triggers me - 

00:14:45
LARRY ZUCKER Yeah. 

00:14:45
ALI BORDEN - or, or anything that has psychological jargon with it about I have self-esteem or issues or, uhm, I, I don't know who I am or any of that, ah, that, that particularly the anorexia discourse is about I have no identity or I was trying to get attention or I did this as the product of my family. Ah, I was acting out things from my family or even I was traumatized it's not that I think there might not be something there. And so that's not a rich enough thing for me to understand what's actually going on so I wanna slow down and go, "Wait, what do you mean by any of that?" 

00:15:15
LARRY ZUCKER So that gives me another-- I keep harping on this idea that the meanings don't pre-exist the conversation. 

00:15:20
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:15:20
LARRY ZUCKER And you have conversations which the meaning is developed. 

00:15:25
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:15:25
LARRY ZUCKER Sounds like one of the things you're alert for there is when somebody imports - 

00:15:30
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:15:30
LARRY ZUCKER - a pre-existing meaning. 

00:15:30
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:15:30
LARRY ZUCKER It might actually have some truths test 

00:15:30
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:15:30
LARRY ZUCKER It might be near to experience but you're sort of suspicious like, "Wait a second this sounds awfully like something I've read in a book." 

00:15:40
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:15:40
LARRY ZUCKER Or awfully something like something that somebody might have drawn you in to a treatment center, - 

00:15:45
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:15:45
LARRY ZUCKER - right? Are, are we sure this way of tracking about it reflects your experience and again you slow down. 

00:15:50
RIVKA Yeah, I think well, I think one of the things when I can't really er-- like right early on I'm like I wanna lose weight and like, "Okay, let's look at that." 

00:15:55
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. 

00:15:55
RIVKA And like you're the first service I ever had. It was like, "No, that's crazy. You can't lose weight," you know. 

00:16:00
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. 

00:16:00
RIVKA I was like, "Hmm, this is interesting." 

00:16:05
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh, what was that like for you? 

00:16:05
RIVKA Uhm, I think I felt like wow! 

00:16:05
ALI BORDEN Okay, did you-- I'm, I'm always a little bit worried that someone thinks that I think they, they need to, that I'm, I'm condoning it. 

00:16:10
RIVKA No, I didn't feel like you were saying that. I... 

00:16:15
ALI BORDEN I guess I wasn't. 

00:16:15
RIVKA Yeah, I didn't feel like you were saying, "Yeah, you're a slut." 

00:16:15
ALI BORDEN Yeah, uh-huh. 

00:16:15
RIVKA I felt like you were just not, uhm, you were just willing to work it whatever it was for what it was - 

00:16:25
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:16:25
RIVKA - and not deciding. 

00:16:25
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:16:25
RIVKA And like, that was super helpful to me. And also just the way, uhm, I have a tendency because I've been to so much therapy, to have this narrative already and you slow it down. And you're like, okay, let's slow that down, let's break it apart and then oh, okay, it is more complicated then. 

00:16:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:16:45
RIVKA And you did that very early too. 

00:16:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. Do-- what do you mean? 

00:16:45
RIVKA Like you said something like-- I remember once you said, "That sounds kind of like a rogue answer." 

00:16:50
ALI BORDEN Ah, uh-huh. 

00:16:50
RIVKA You know, and I was like, "It's true. I have all these prepared answers." 

00:16:50
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. 

00:16:55
RIVKA And it's not that they're not true, - 

00:16:55
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:16:55
RIVKA - it's just that there's so much more there. And I think a lot of therapists would just accept that answer. 

00:17:00
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:17:00
RIVKA Ah, and, not, think, "Wait, there's some off - 

00:17:05
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:17:05
RIVKA - or missing or more." 

00:17:05
ALI BORDEN How do we make a richer description of that because that just feels like it's the, the parts that have been na-- named and labeled so far but there's, there's more to this story than just that first slice at things. 

00:17:20
RIVKA And I think I have a tendency to kinda skip ahead and you have a tendency to slow me down. 

00:17:25
ALI BORDEN To slow you down, uh-huh. 

00:17:25
ALI BORDEN It sounds like you and, and a-- and everybody looked at what you, what you wanted and where you wanted to go and develop that sense in the sense that you weren't really clear with. And so, less so about what you wanted to get rid of and more so about where you wanted to go. 

00:17:40
TESSA Yeah, and as we developed that what I was trying to get rid of just didn't fit in the picture as well. It's like you're trying to do a jigsaw puzzle - 

00:17:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:17:50
TESSA - and we're trying to do all the pieces of the life that I'm going towards. 

00:17:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:17:50
TESSA And you start finding out that like some of those eating disorder-- pieces I kinda leave behind like, ah, they're the puzzle, like they're not fitting in this one. 

00:18:00
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. 

00:18:00
TESSA And so like I keep trying to fit them in but it just-- you don't try to fit a puzzle piece in it. I just, it either won't go or it sticks so the thing doesn't work. 

00:18:05
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:18:05
TESSA That's kinda how it felt. 

00:18:05
ALI BORDEN Gotcha. 

00:18:05
TESSA When the pieces came to the other one the other pieces just had, like I had to choose. 

00:18:10
ALI BORDEN Fall away. 

00:18:10
TESSA Like fall away. 

00:18:10
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh, yeah. 

00:18:15
TESSA Each puzzle that I wanna keep working on. 

00:18:15
ALI BORDEN Yeah, that's a beautiful metaphor. It sounds like you went this, I'm not keeping these anymore cuz they don't make sense with things that I care about. 

00:18:20
TESSA Yeah. 

00:18:20
ALI BORDEN So I'm gonna-- they fell away as opposed to like fighting them or pushing them back or white-knuckling, resisting or anything like that. 

00:18:30
TESSA Yeah, I mean there were some I definitely had to like, work really hard at - 

00:18:30
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:18:30
TESSA - but it wasn't because someone was telling me you have to get rid of this one. 

00:18:35
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:18:40
TESSA I mean, not really. 

00:18:40
ALI BORDEN It was because... 

00:18:40
TESSA It was, it was because I was making the choice to get rid of them - 

00:18:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:18:45
TESSA - because, cuz what I, what I knew what I was staying to see what I wanted and it-- I couldn't-- I, I could see how it wasn't gonna work. 

00:18:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:18:55
TESSA So I could see the if I chose to not sit in a chair and walk around, like that's gonna be really hard for me to go to movies with friends. 

00:19:00
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. 

00:19:00
TESSA And so I had to figure out how I was gonna figure that piece out you know. 

00:19:05
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:19:05
TESSA If I, you know, didn't wanna come. I fondle on the little bits you know, because I won't be able to go and eat a hamburger with my friends or you know, it just it-- the two didn't work - 

00:19:15
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:19:15
TESSA - and I got to make a choice in that. 

00:19:15
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:19:15
TESSA And so I was the one who was like, this isn't working. Like I-- I have to white-knuckle it because of what I want, - 

00:19:20
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. 

00:19:20
TESSA - you know. 

00:19:25
ALI BORDEN Right. Ah, it's such a big difference I suppose because I'm broken and I need to get rid of this or because someone's telling me that I have to or... 

00:19:30
TESSA It is, like I remember at UCLA like, you know, I sat down, I felt like a turkey sandwich in front of me and like, you have to eat the turkey sandwich and you can't cut it. You have to eat the whole thing. 

00:19:35
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:19:35
TESSA And like, I hadn't even put like, anything besides, I think like the whole time, a piece of fruit in my mouth from, ah, six months. 

00:19:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:19:45
TESSA I was like, I do not understand like how am I supposed to go from there to there - 

00:19:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:19:45
TESSA - and if I couldn't it was just taken away and I was given like a supplement and it wasn't-- no one asked or talked about like why am I-- being wanna do this. Why did this feel important, this step. Why did it feel important to change this behavior - 

00:20:00
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:20:00
TESSA - and that felt better. 

00:20:00
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. It seems to make a difference. 

00:20:05
TESSA It, it seems like it made more sense and it didn't make it as much of a power struggle. When someone else tells you it's what you have to do because I say so - 

00:20:10
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:20:10
TESSA - I don't know. For me that doesn't really work. Uhm, we should like-- no. 

00:20:15
ALI BORDEN Yeah, just resistant. Uh-huh, yeah. 

00:20:15
TESSA Yeah, like well, why are we doing this for you or the other alternative would be, "Fine, I'll do it for you cuz I'm here. I have to do - 

00:20:20
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:20:20
TESSA - it cuz you're telling me to." And then, I mean as soon as I was like signing myself out at the end of that program I would snack by the garbage bin - 

00:20:25
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:20:25
TESSA - like I was exercising at the airport. They didn't last cuz I didn't know why we were making those changes - 

00:20:30
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:20:30
TESSA Except to get to the level I wanted in the program and to you know, do. It was just-- it wasn't, it wasn't for me at that point. 

00:20:40
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:20:45
5 Beyond binaries: putting into language small steps towards a variety of goals 

00:20:50
[sil.] 

00:20:55
LARRY ZUCKER That sound like you, you hear complexities in sentences where other people might hear a choice to be made between black and white. 

00:21:00
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:21:00
LARRY ZUCKER You, you hear, you hear the person frame it as black and white choice. 

00:21:05
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:21:05
LARRY ZUCKER But you-- it sounds like you, you automatically-- or you have trained yourself to h-- to listen for richer possibilities. 

00:21:10
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:21:10
LARRY ZUCKER What else is there besides black or white? 

00:21:15
ALI BORDEN So the-- 

00:21:15
LARRY ZUCKER And the you want-- you could just go there quickly and automatically. 

00:21:15
ALI BORDEN It's, it's, it's definitely a, a way of listening going. There must be some way to think about this in subtle forms. It's not safety or lack of safety. 

00:21:25
see writings by Johnella Bird 

00:21:25
ALI BORDEN There's degrees of safety or moments of safety or there's all kinds of ways to like, make things, uhm, ah, and, ah, possible because of the small steps that you can do in there and it's black and white. It's just-- it feels like it closes down possibilities and ignores the small steps that people take. It's... 

00:21:45
LARRY ZUCKER So Tessa referred to this in term of, in terms of continuum. 

00:21:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:21:50
LARRY ZUCKER You know, that, that, that she was really emphasizing how there was something about, ah, through conversation with you, through conversations with others who are in-- influenced by these ideas. Ah, these, ah, choices move from binaries to continue a-- where there's, ah, ah, many steps along a continuum. 

00:22:10
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:22:10
LARRY ZUCKER And you can be here, you can be here, you can be here. 

00:22:10
ALI BORDEN In that conversation what I said to her is there is-- and there's many different continuums on this big continuum - 

00:22:15
LARRY ZUCKER Yeah. 

00:22:15
ALI BORDEN - so there's no longer-- which was one of the ways that I go about saying, "Oh, but how do we even break that up smaller?" So there's lots of little things that you're trying to be successful on in this path to be happier on your life and it can't just be about food weight, it can't even just be about speaking enough for yourself, it can't even just be about, ah, how far you are at your career. It needs to be-- there's lots of steps towards all of those little goals which are all heading towards a big goal of being happier which is no longer a goal of, a goal of just reduction of behaviors. 

00:22:50
ALI BORDEN So what values do you think to relationships with one of lamba-- what are some of the values you said verily helps you to hold on to things that sometimes you couldn't - 

00:22:55
TESSA Mm-hmm. 

00:22:55
ALI BORDEN - hold on to. Like, what are some of those things that can, can you even name a couple of things that you're-- or projects that your values that you're holding on to. 

00:23:05
TESSA Well definitely like the relationship like accountability. Uhm, that I'm someone who's trying to hold, hold both like that I, I'm not black or white or perfectionistic or like-- cuz I'm still pulled into like, the binary and even in my own rec-- recovery or life, like I'm like, "No, I need to be here." And either great or it's like all terrible - 

00:23:30
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:23:30
TESSA - and it's like, "No." Like you know, you're struggling here, you're doing well here can both be true. 

00:23:35
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:23:35
TESSA And like, she helps me hold on to that and I felt like she was doing that all the way back then and you guys were too, like still talking about this is true and this is true and neither one means anything huge about you like, can't we just have both there. And for me still that's so hard. I mean, so... 

00:23:50
ALI BORDEN So can you give me an example either then or now, I don't care-- even ways but about what those two things might be like I wanna be able to hold on to the x but also y. 

00:24:05
TESSA Ah, well like, I mean I guess you do like recovery like right now, like I want to hold on. That I can still have areas I'm struggling with. 

00:24:15
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:24:15
TESSA And I can also have, have come a really far way and have all these things in my life that are going really well. 

00:24:20
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:24:20
TESSA And I'm still not a hundred percent better yet. 

00:24:20
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:24:20
TESSA But it doesn't mean anything. Like it's not like, it's been this many years since you've been out. Like if you're not there that means that's it, you're done or, or, uhm, or you know, I struggle more. One week than I have in a couple of months or something then all of a sudden it's all bad which when I'm by myself I can sometimes get caught thinking. I mean I'm a lot better and I can pull myself out of it. Usually within an hour but I do have that moment of like, you know, "Ah, I did too much exercise today. Oh my God, it's all bad." I'm not any better, it's pointless or everything. 

00:24:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:24:50
TESSA And then it's like, "No, it's not true." Like you're struggling more right now and you know school's really stressful and life's really stressful and you're moving and you have financial stress and all those stuff and so it makes sense. Then it's, it's okay like it-- don't make any big meaning about it and don't do any major course corrections. When you have cuz either end thinking all the way better, thinking I'm all the way not good. 

00:25:10
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:25:10
TESSA If I act, if I don't hold both and I respond to either one of those that when I real-- that's usually when I things get messier. 

00:25:15
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. Cuz you start veering really wildly, one direction or another. Mm-hmm. 

00:25:20
TESSA Yeah, yeah. Unlike right now like, one area of my life I'm trying to apply this like all good or all bad. It's like school, like and when-- and I have a 4.0 and I'm like, I'm-- this is a really hard semester. I'm taking like 24 units and like, I might not keep my 4.0 and I finally like to take two classes pass-fail which is so hard for me because I don't-- I've o-- I don't know how to get anything other than a. I can know what a work looks like. 

00:25:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:25:45
TESSA Ah, pass-fail all I have to do is get like a c or better - 

00:25:50
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. 

00:25:50
TESSA - so for me finding that gray in between - 

00:25:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:25:50
TESSA - and being okay with that. 

00:25:55
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:25:55
TESSA And even electing to do a pass fail you know. 

00:25:55
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. 

00:25:55
TESSA Uhm, cuz that's one area you know - 

00:25:55
ALI BORDEN That's all. 

00:25:55
TESSA - that I'm definitely working on. 

00:26:00
ALI BORDEN That's awesome. So it, it sounds like there was an-- also a black and white idea like you trying to get out the black and white idea. Sort of sick and recovered. Like that, there's this idea that, "Oh, I still might have some growing edges and I'm still doing things that I'm really proud of that I wouldn't have been able to do 10 years ago or whatever it is." 

00:26:15
TESSA Yeah. 

00:26:15
ALI BORDEN Like, like it's called both in some way. 

00:26:20
TESSA Yeah, it is. And that's still weird for me. I, I still-- there's part of my brain that still wants to go, "No." Like you're this or you're that. 

00:26:25
ALI BORDEN You're sick or you're well you know. 

00:26:25
TESSA You're sick or you're well but that it's like on like a spectrum or continuum, it that what it's called? 

00:26:30
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:26:30
TESSA And then it's like, okay like you're moving this barricade. Maybe you're back here, maybe you move this way a bit like now you're moving this way and like, it, it all changes and, and, and again as long as medal of stability is there, that it's still all okay. 

00:26:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:26:45
TESSA And what usually will move me more one direction is not like that there's judgment. It's more like I know, I get connected to the life I-- the level I want, the one I'm choosing and if I'm experiencing something that feels like it's not getting me there or it's keeping me from that level that will usually like push me forward. She cared more about like all areas of my life and celebrated triumphs whether it was a food triumph or a job triumph or a clothing triumph or you know, anything like that. They were all equally important. 

00:27:20
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. So triumphs weren't just narrowed down to weight goals but... 

00:27:25
TESSA Weight or food. 

00:27:25
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. 

00:27:25
TESSA It was, it was all areas you know. It was, it was if I was able to push back against a boss, if I was able to set a limit, if I was able to use my voice I was able to you know, fight the perfectionism, get through a fear. One of the fear was applying for a job, looking for an apartment, moving into a hard situation or it was you know, eating that's gone or something. 

00:27:45
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. 

00:27:45
TESSA You know they were all equally huge. The scene is-- all we're seeing is equally important. 

00:27:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:27:55
6 Developing individual goals based on client's dreams for their lives Exploring complexity of desires individual choices for living and goals Steps the head toward preferred future Positively formed goal vs absence of behaviors 

00:28:00
ALI BORDEN So by exploring the complexity of our clients' desires and where they wanna go with their lives and refusing to simplify or categorize them into simple diagnosis and trying to get them into just an absence of that diagnosis. I think we open up space for many choices of living and encourage them to be very specific about what they want and their goals and then work with them to look at what steps might they be taking that were heading towards their vision of a future which is a positively formed goal as opposed to a negatively formed goal which is just the absence of behaviors. 

00:28:35
LARRY ZUCKER So earlier in your career you were, ah, ah, anti-anorexia a-and now you're anti-reductionism. 

00:28:45
ALI BORDEN Yeah, yeah exactly. 

00:28:45
LARRY ZUCKER You're, you're, you're, you're, you're anti, ah, binary, anti, ah, unitary, ah, anti-simplicity. 

00:28:50
ALI BORDEN And anti pre-arriving at any idea - 

00:28:55
LARRY ZUCKER Yeah, you're anti pre-conception. 

00:28:55
ALI BORDEN - like it's so important to me that, that all options are on the table. 

00:29:00
LARRY ZUCKER Oh. 

00:29:00
ALI BORDEN I think personally, uhm, I want all of my options for living to be able to be preserved and any choices that I make in my life and I want to be-- have the authority to decide whether those are okay for me or not instead of having somebody say you're allowed to love this person or not this person or you're allowed to weigh this much and not this much or you're allowed to live here or not here. I want all of those for me and I therefore, am trying to preserve those for clients too - 

00:29:20
LARRY ZUCKER Mm-hmm. 

00:29:25
ALI BORDEN - and I can't just preserve the ones that I wanna preserve. 

00:29:25
LARRY ZUCKER Yeah. 

00:29:25
ALI BORDEN Like I-- that just feels like it's inherently contradictory. 

00:29:30
LARRY ZUCKER So, so you're preserving all options - 

00:29:30
ALI BORDEN Yup. 

00:29:30
LARRY ZUCKER - until your client has made choices. 

00:29:30
ALI BORDEN Yeah, they get to chose even if they're not the ones that I would chose. 

00:29:35
LARRY ZUCKER Right. 

00:29:35
ALI BORDEN Even if the, the psychological community decides that those are unhealthy ones. You know, they can be smokers or not smokers. They, they get to decide what kinds of lives that they wanna live - 

00:29:45
LARRY ZUCKER Right. 

00:29:45
ALI BORDEN - and that feels like-- and that the goal, uhm, through a line for me. 

00:29:50
LARRY ZUCKER Mm-hmm. 

00:29:50
RIVKA I-- and I never ever get the sense from you that when I say something you know, horrified or like you haven't heard it all before or you know. 

00:30:00
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. 

00:30:00
RIVKA And I just, I feel-- I guess I feel a lot of none judgments - 

00:30:05
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:30:05
RIVKA And I need, I need a lot of none judgment from the other person to be able to be less judgmental myself. 

00:30:10
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:30:10
RIVKA It's like-- and I feel like I could say anything to you and you wouldn't label it right away, you wouldn't decide what it meant. 

00:30:20
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:30:20
RIVKA Uhm, it would just be in the room - 

00:30:20
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:30:20
RIVKA - you know. 

00:30:20
ALI BORDEN So how do we, how do we figure out what something means. Do you have some sen-- like sense of... instead of going old that clearly sets with anorexia or it doesn't fit with anorexia it sounds like there's more of, ah, something else where you offer it up and... 

00:30:35
RIVKA It's a conversation - 

00:30:35
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:30:35
RIVKA - where it's like where we decide you know. So, and that makes it really safe because I don't have to beg what is she going to make of this before. I don't have to have-- it's like pre-conception of what you're gonna think. 

00:30:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. And strategically place it in - 

00:30:50
RIVKA Yeah. 

00:30:50
ALI BORDEN - some way. It's like I don't, I don't know what sense to make of this. I'm gonna offer it up and we'll do it together. 

00:31:00
RIVKA Yeah. 

00:31:00
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:31:00
RIVKA And I don't even have to know what it me-- like I used to think, I used to ha-- think I had to figure out what it meant and how to solve it and the whole before I can bring it up in therapy. 

00:31:05
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. 

00:31:10
RIVKA That... 

00:31:10
ALI BORDEN So it was just a whole part of you that was coming - 

00:31:10
RIVKA Yeah. 

00:31:10
ALI BORDEN - that everybody was interested in having that. So do you have some sense about how you came to know that, ah, that I wasn't-- not gonna be judgmental or that I wasn't gonna predetermine meaning or we were gonna be able to figure it out together. 

00:31:25
RIVKA I think part of it is the way you talk about things you know. And also that you give me little-- not in the, you know, like over-- this close but, but you give me little tidbits from your own experience - 

00:31:35
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:31:35
RIVKA - and that's very helpful to me because I can't really trust someone if they don't offer me something. 

00:31:40
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:31:40
RIVKA Do you know what I mean? Like, I feel like for me therapy is a shared experience - 

00:31:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:31:45
RIVKA - and I need something from the therapist to - 

00:31:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:31:50
RIVKA - like, I don't know. I need a sen-- I, I need a really good sense of the therapist and who-- I need a good sense of who you are as a person and I feel like even though there's so much I don't know about you that I do have a good sense of that. 

00:32:00
ALI BORDEN So it sounds like there was a lot of emphasis on building a lot about what you wanted and what you-- what, what kind of life you dreamed of and what your preferences were and what kind of friend you wanted to be and what kind of person you wanted to be and what your aspirations were as opposed to nickel-and-diming about food or, - 

00:32:20
TESSA Yeah. 

00:32:20
ALI BORDEN - uhm, spending a lot of time about obsessions or something like that. 

00:32:25
TESSA Yeah, yeah. 

00:32:25
ALI BORDEN Did you feel like it? Yes, mm-hmm. 

00:32:25
TESSA We didn't even-- I don't feel like there was even... I mean obviously we talked about the eating disorder so you're a lot but I don't feel like it was so much focus on like-- I think other places really wanted to go back to like when did it start and what exactly was happening and, and we still did that but it wasn't like the first thing you jumped in with. 

00:32:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:32:45
TESSA You know, I mean there was a brief history you had to get but it wasn't something that was talked about all the time. Like that will come up when it needs to and sometimes it will be more of the focus but other times it wasn't and it wasn't like you came in and everybody had to like, go back and trace where it started and why. 

00:33:00
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. What do you remember about that? The first couple of groups where you get introduced and where, you know, ah, compared to other places. 

00:33:10
TESSA Why, I remember like we had to this life map group and you'd let it and you would sit and ask questions but it wasn't about the eating disorder at all. It's about all other aspects of your life and then other clients would sit around and we'd listen to the conversation and we were encouraged to kinda make notes and ask questions and, uhm, until you got to see the person besides the eating disorder. 

00:33:30
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:33:30
TESSA and I think that was huge because at other places I go into I don't-- we wouldn't call life map but you usually had to give like your eating disorder history - 

00:33:40
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:33:40
TESSA - and it would start with you know, maybe it start with where you're born. But it pretty much quickly started whenever the eating disorder started and kind of like it became super depressing and also we were kinda competition then in places because well you've been this sick, well I've been this sick and I've been to this many places and you guys took that totally out of it. 

00:33:55
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:34:00
TESSA And so right then, it wasn't like your identity wasn't immediately made with you're anorexic, you're bulimic, you're this you're that. It was like, oh, you have a sister, you have brother, you won a major in this, you play that instrument, you're the answer. 

00:34:10
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:34:10
TESSA Like, how neat. Like you didn't do gymnastics and you got suspended from school or... 

00:34:15
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:34:15
TESSA So it was you s-- you shifted-- we didn't even shift, you didn't let a chance for that identity to be formed right away - 

00:34:20
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:34:20
TESSA As opposed to other place. I felt like you walked in and it was immediately-- you kinda got to like pick your label - 

00:34:25
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:34:25
TESSA - and tell your story and that was kind of what it was. 

00:34:30
ALI BORDEN So it sound like a different story you've managed to come through and what difference did that make that that was how people got introduced to each other? You know, and how you relate it to even each other or how you thought about yourself. 

00:34:40
TESSA I think it was neat cuz it, it-- for me it helped us out of the eating disorder like, I just remember it was-- I think it's one of the first things that lead people to be able to develop relationships. I think it was-- started building closeness to other people seeing that I had this in common with you. And that gave me something to talk about in like, the down time between groups or even in groups as opposed to talking about your eating disorder. Where other places it was like, you, you connected over the eating disorder more. 

00:35:10
ALI BORDEN you did to this behavior, so do I and before that - 

00:35:10
TESSA Yeah, yeah. 

00:35:10
ALI BORDEN I'm bruised, uh-huh. 

00:35:10
TESSA Like, okay let's exercise in our room together you know like, you know. Or I've done that or you did that and comparing like war stories. 

00:35:15
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:35:15
TESSA But you get this idea of closeness but it's not real. 

00:35:20
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:35:20
TESSA And at other times, I mean we talked about like games or telling jokes and then you could go and talk about or play those games and it, it allowed us to keep developing that identity outside of the eating disorder. 

00:35:40
7 Supporting a client's authority to make choices for their own lives 

00:35:45
LARRY ZUCKER So there's the segment of tape - 

00:35:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:35:45
LARRY ZUCKER - ah, where Rivka talks about therapists sort of making the mistake of taking up the healthy voice - 

00:35:50
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:35:50
LARRY ZUCKER - which would then, for her, be sort of an invitation to take up the voice of anorexia - 

00:35:55
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:35:55
LARRY ZUCKER - and it would become a debate between her and her therapist - 

00:36:00
ALI BORDEN Yeah, mm-hmm. 

00:36:00
LARRY ZUCKER - over health - 

00:36:00
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:36:00
LARRY ZUCKER Rather than you're talking about not talking up a position first and helping a client chose you know, is it better this way or this way or this way. It's like she's having a, a conversation with you which perhaps leads to a debate with herself - 

00:36:15
ALI BORDEN Yes. 

00:36:15
LARRY ZUCKER - where she has to make some choices - 

00:36:15
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:36:15
LARRY ZUCKER - but she's debating herself and not debating you. 

00:36:20
ALI BORDEN Exactly. I, I has sympathy actually for how therapists and, and this will follow my-- the way that I work - 

00:36:25
LARRY ZUCKER Yeah. 

00:36:25
ALI BORDEN - and that I feel like therapists would-- who do that are-- have good intentions. 

00:36:30
LARRY ZUCKER Yes, yeah. 

00:36:30
ALI BORDEN And I could sometimes find myself in that position I create... 

00:36:35
LARRY ZUCKER You slip at it you know. 

00:36:35
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:36:35
LARRY ZUCKER Try to convince somebody to, to you know... 

00:36:35
ALI BORDEN Totally, as though you just wanna convince them of the logic or point out downsides of what they're doing - 

00:36:40
LARRY ZUCKER Yeah. 

00:36:40
ALI BORDEN - or something like that. It's so easy to do and to me it's a position of not knowing what else to do. Like-- but I don't think it actually-- it's certainly not fun. I don't think it's fun for a client either and I don't think it's effective. 

00:36:55
LARRY ZUCKER I've, I've gotta get you to behave in this other way first. 

00:36:55
ALI BORDEN Yeah, absolutely. 

00:36:55
LARRY ZUCKER So I'm-- so this-- a lot, this philosophically this keeps circling back - 

00:37:00
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:37:00
LARRY ZUCKER - to how that's a position you hold. 

00:37:05
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:37:05
LARRY ZUCKER You know, that in, that unless you have to. 

00:37:05
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:37:05
LARRY ZUCKER For you therapy consist of conversations where people make richer sense of their struggle and more importantly richer sense of the life they have in mind for themselves. 

00:37:20
ALI BORDEN Absolutely. 

00:37:20
LARRY ZUCKER And you're gonna make sure the conversations are about that unless they have to be about something else. 

00:37:25
ALI BORDEN Something else, yeah. 

00:37:25
LARRY ZUCKER Uh-huh. 

00:37:25
ALI BORDEN Ah, it, it actually isn't-- it's, it's not a very complicated methodology or theory. 

00:37:30
LARRY ZUCKER Right, no. 

00:37:30
ALI BORDEN It's pretty simple about going-- I actually don't think that me making a decision is going to-- and, and coercing someone into that decision however subtly or overly - 

00:37:40
LARRY ZUCKER Yeah. 

00:37:40
ALI BORDEN - is going to be effective. 

00:37:40
LARRY ZUCKER All right. 

00:37:45
ALI BORDEN ah, I think that that's actual-- that, that insistence begets resistance and like, ah, so that I'm wanting to go as slow as possible to bring them side by side with me and go let's look at what's happening - 

00:37:55
LARRY ZUCKER Mm-hmm. 

00:37:55
ALI BORDEN - and, and try and hallucinate it as clear as possible and go, "Oh what are the effects of what is happening - 

00:38:00
LARRY ZUCKER Mm-hmm. 

00:38:00
ALI BORDEN - and what choices do you wanna make about that?" So I'm doing my best the entire time to do that. 

00:38:10
LARRY ZUCKER And, and the effect of that to me was very clear in the interview tapes. 

00:38:10
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:38:10
LARRY ZUCKER That, ah, all of the people that you interviewed, ah, spoke very clearly about what it meant to them to be treated as the person who has to make these choices. 

00:38:20
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:38:20
LARRY ZUCKER Right? 

00:38:20
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:38:20
LARRY ZUCKER And, and to-- e-e-and, and not o-- in the beginning it sound like e-- each of them had their own version of like, "Well this is weird" right? 

00:38:30
ALI BORDEN Yeah, yeah. 

00:38:30
LARRY ZUCKER But it sounds like they all ended up on an appreciative place. 

00:38:30
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:38:35
LARRY ZUCKER About being sort of given the freedom and the responsibility - 

00:38:35
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:38:35
LARRY ZUCKER - to make those choices - 

00:38:40
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:38:40
LARRY ZUCKER - for themselves about their own lives. 

00:38:40
ALI BORDEN And I think different people come to it differently like some clients feel excited by that. Oh, I get to chose, oh, I can have partial decisions, oh, I can experiment this, I can try one thing and I'll have to commit to it. Oh, there's no right and wrong, there's just what I want. I can change my mind like that, that feels liberating to some clients. 

00:39:00
LARRY ZUCKER Mm-hmm. 

00:39:00
ALI BORDEN And, I would-- I had to put and umbrella(ph). I think more especially after they've, if they've been through treatment things that have done all the deciding for them, that it's a relief to actually have some authority over their own life. 

00:39:10
LARRY ZUCKER Mm-hmm. 

00:39:10
ALI BORDEN To be reintegrated into the-- you're not treated as someone who doesn't know. You're treated as someone who does know and that that's - 

00:39:20
LARRY ZUCKER Right 

00:39:20
ALI BORDEN - really half, uhm, liberating for them. 

00:39:20
LARRY ZUCKER Yeah. 

00:39:25
ALI BORDEN Do you think you would be sensitive if I was suddenly trying to coerce you some way. 

00:39:25
RIVKA Very, very. 

00:39:30
ALI BORDEN And you think-- you, you think, you know that? 

00:39:30
RIVKA I think I would. I mean I'm, I'm really-- I think I'm pretty sensitive to other people's intentions or... 

00:39:35
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:39:40
RIVKA I know of its intentions but I think I would feel it if, uhm, if you were pushing me somewhere. 

00:39:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:39:45
RIVKA And I think would-- or might resist. 

00:39:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:39:45
RIVKA Just-- either principle 

00:39:50
 Uh-huh. You-- so like if you had said I'm thinking about losing weight and I went, you shouldn't do that or even if I was more subtle about it like, "Oh, I suppose" but you could tell. I don't even-- I can't even think of what coercing would be but you would be able to tell, ah, a sort of an agenda I have about that. 

00:40:05
RIVKA Yeah, and I think that I have had therapy before where, uhm, it almost felt like the therapist was kinda con-- trying to convince me to recover. 

00:40:10
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:40:10
RIVKA And the problem with that is that when they were being just the healthy voice or whatever it kinda made me respond with just my eating disorder voice. 

00:40:20
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. 

00:40:20
RIVKA So it kinda strengthened the eating disorder - 

00:40:20
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:40:25
RIVKA - counter-intuitively probably to them but it kinda made it a dialogue between their healthy self and my eating disorder. 

00:40:30
ALI BORDEN Yeah, it sounds like it brings up debate - 

00:40:30
RIVKA Yes. 

00:40:30
ALI BORDEN - cuz it's like, well I'm gonna make this point and you're gonna wanna make this point back and now we're gonna have this debate. And somehow I, I know theoretically I'm thinking how we're gonna be on the same side where we're both going. What do you think about that idea? 

00:40:40
RIVKA Mm-hmm. 

00:40:45
ALI BORDEN Does, does losing weight fit for what you're wanting for your life? How-- what consequences might there be? 

00:40:50
RIVKA Mm-hmm. 

00:40:50
ALI BORDEN Like somehow, how I'm, I'm constantly trying to think about how to we be on the same side. 

00:40:55
RIVKA Yeah. 

00:40:55
ALI BORDEN Uhm, that would-- so that you're like eh, eh, not feeling like I'm trying to overpower you in some way or already have some idea. 

00:41:00
RIVKA Yeah, and I think people with eating disorders have-- are very sensitive. They like control and power dynamics - 

00:41:05
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. 

00:41:05
RIVKA - you know. So it's something that I think-- and I think it happens a lot in treatment - 

00:41:10
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:41:15
RIVKA - and, and it, it does in a way because you're-- you give up so much power being in treatments. 

00:41:15
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:41:20
RIVKA And you're a ready-- and I think that are re-- ah, automatically brings up resistance. It di-- it di-- it did-- it does for me. 

00:41:25
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:41:25
RIVKA Like I would sometimes go into treatment and I'm gonna do this and I get there, I'm like, "Ii don't wanna" cuz they're making me. 

00:41:30
ALI BORDEN So they're... 

00:41:35
8 Complexity opens up space for many choices for living Resist singular descriptions of identity Recognize clients are complex Multiplicity of desires and dreams Out of complexity comes an individual's reasons for life choices Conversations about what steps move clients closer to dreams and preferred future 

00:41:40
ALI BORDEN It's important for us as clinicians to resist simplifying or categorizing people into singular descriptions of identity or seeing them as a specific kind of diagnosis. Instead, if, if my value is to, to, to see clients as being complex and having a multiplicity of desires and thing that are pulling them in different directions cross purposes, things are resisting, things that they're moving towards. and I wanna hear all the complexity in there and I think out of that complexity there's gonna-- it's g-- we're gonna get lots and lots of choices for how clients wanna be their own specific, individual reasons for, for what's important to them. And I think once we have a specific dreamed of goals and intentions and where they get caught and w-- and what they want for their lives then we can have conversations with our clients about what steps would bring them closer to their dreams and their own preferred version of the future. 

00:42:40
LARRY ZUCKER Can we talk about recovery a bit? 

00:42:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm, yeah. 

00:42:45
LARRY ZUCKER You know Tessa in a section of tape, talks about you know, whether or not she was committed to recovery, whether she not-- she was being perceived as committed to recovery. 

00:42:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:42:55
LARRY ZUCKER Like they, you know, do you even wanna get better or you don't wanna get better or you don't wanna get better - 

00:42:55
ALI BORDEN Yeah 

00:42:55
LARRY ZUCKER - you know. Uhm, there were thoughts about that. Ah... 

00:43:00
ALI BORDEN There's so many black and whites ins-- in that, even a small section of what you just said. 

00:43:05
LARRY ZUCKER Right. 

00:43:05
ALI BORDEN There's blacks and whites about do you want to get better or not get better and there's what better is and what better isn't - 

00:43:10
LARRY ZUCKER Uh-huh. 

00:43:10
ALI BORDEN - and I wanna slow all of that down and make millions of slices in there. I-- better feels like the-- what according to what no-- what standard of better. They, they were likely judging here because you haven't stopped doing xy and z or weight restore or something like - 

00:43:25
LARRY ZUCKER Mm-hmm. 

00:43:25
ALI BORDEN - you still manipulate your weight then you must not wanna get better because you haven't changed your behavior. But if you had if you had a small enough conversation with here there were probably a lot of things that she was doing that were improving ac-- according to a number of measures. 

00:43:40
LARRY ZUCKER Mm-hmm. 

00:43:40
ALI BORDEN Uhm, number one and number two there could have been a huge amount of desire to get better that wasn't actually playing out in behaviors yet. 

00:43:50
LARRY ZUCKER Right. 

00:43:50
ALI BORDEN Then people get confused about because they're nodding aloud, aloud. They're not allowing for people-- and our language doesn't generally allow for people to be simultaneously in more than one place at the same time. 

00:44:00
LARRY ZUCKER Yeah. 

00:44:00
ALI BORDEN And I'm, I believe that people are incredibly complex all the time and everything is temporary and shifting and moving so that even if you are something you might not be that in a few minutes and I also think that you are often too-- totally think compatible things at the same time. I wanna get better and I don't wanna get better. And then somebody on the opposite side, in an attempt to make those cohesive, tries to, to, to make you take a position. So does that mean you wanna get better or you don't or you must not wanna get better? 

00:44:30
LARRY ZUCKER Take a position within a binary. 

00:44:30
ALI BORDEN Yes. 

00:44:35
LARRY ZUCKER Take a position within a reductionistic - 

00:44:35
ALI BORDEN Exactly. 

00:44:35
LARRY ZUCKER - account. 

00:44:35
ALI BORDEN And all of a sudden you're so narrow, people have to pick a side as opposed to going, that's really interesting. I'm actually interested in many things so tell me about both sides. What is it that you love about doing rituals? I'm just-- I'm happy to talk to you about why you bother, keep doing them? Why would you wanna not do them anymore. Like, you know, like what parts do you love, what parts do you not love? That-- and even that there's 10 other things like the-- there's gonna be millions more splits down that conversation - 

00:45:05
LARRY ZUCKER Mm-hmm. 

00:45:05
ALI BORDEN - than a black and white of wanting to get better. You don't-- I actually think clients come in a single sentence that will, uhm, present them in... 

00:45:15
LARRY ZUCKER Be full of contradictions. 

00:45:15
ALI BORDEN Full of contradictions. 

00:45:15
LARRY ZUCKER Right. 

00:45:15
ALI BORDEN And if you, if you don't require them to, to, to, to pick a side that you actually have, there's tons of places to go. So that's super interesting. A minute ago you said this and now you're saying this. That's really interesting to me if you tell me about both sides instead of which one is it. 

00:45:35
LARRY ZUCKER Which is it. 

00:45:35
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:45:35
LARRY ZUCKER You know it, it, it occurs to me that the, the literature on eating disorders often characterizes people as being rigid thinking or black and white thinkers and when I listen to what you're saying now it's like our field has produced a series of black and white questions - 

00:45:50
ALI BORDEN Yes, and... 

00:45:50
LARRY ZUCKER - to ask rigid thinkers about which it is. 

00:45:50
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh. And, and you... 

00:45:50
LARRY ZUCKER All right. And it sounds like you do something very different when those black and white frameworks im-- emerge. 

00:46:00
ALI BORDEN Yes. Well when they speak from them well I must not wanted to get better, wanted to get better because otherwise I would be better. I wanna go-- hold on, one second I'm actually interested in, in taking that apart a little bit and going slower through that. And is-- had there been parts of you that wanted to get better even though you haven't improved on some measures of that. 

00:46:15
LARRY ZUCKER Right. 

00:46:20
ALI BORDEN So I immediately start trying to slow down and make subtle ba-- distinctions in there and when they're caught by the ears they're often confused cuz they're thinking, "Well, uhm, I must not be anorexic if I did this one thing cuz that doesn't-- 

00:46:30
LARRY ZUCKER Mm-hmm. 

00:46:30
ALI BORDEN - I gained weight this week and then I must not be anorexic." 

00:46:35
LARRY ZUCKER Mm-hmm. 

00:46:35
ALI BORDEN So they're constantly evaluating themselves against the black and white notion which I think they've been handed by a culture that tends to both linguistically because we call ourselves-- I am anorexic or I'm not. There's no-- 

00:46:45
LARRY ZUCKER Mm-hmm. 

00:46:45
ALI BORDEN - get it. There's-- it's really difficult to go on partially anorexic or there's, there's, there's - 

00:46:50
LARRY ZUCKER Yeah. 

00:46:50
ALI BORDEN - not a really dis-- It's all clumsy to talk impartialities. 

00:46:55
LARRY ZUCKER Yeah. 

00:46:55
ALI BORDEN So we have to actually, uhm, find ways for that to be in language but it, it-- you, you'd be surprised at how many things you can pull on. If you don't have it I often ask questions like, uhm, where's the rub? What are you torn by? What, what, ah, ah, eh, what do you think about that? There's lots of ways to put multiple things in a room. What, what are all the ideas that are out there about that, which ones do you prefer? Like there's a lot of questions that actually make for many slices of experience - 

00:47:25
LARRY ZUCKER Mm-hmm. 

00:47:25
ALI BORDEN - if it's not already apparent. But I actually think if you change the way you listened it will be in every sentence. 

00:47:35
LARRY ZUCKER Mm-hmm. 

00:47:35
ALI BORDEN Like in, in that, that actually it's not as hard as it sounds. It just means letting go of psychological ideas about an authentic self and that there's one true and one, one not. Rivka refers to this - 

00:47:45
LARRY ZUCKER Yeah. 

00:47:45
ALI BORDEN - where she's, she, she felt like there, there must be some true and whatever the true is, is the bad, uhm, - 

00:47:50
LARRY ZUCKER Right, right. 

00:47:50
ALI BORDEN - self. So it's like, if I have anger then that must be the true me - 

00:47:55
LARRY ZUCKER Right. 

00:47:55
ALI BORDEN And there's always some attempt to go. Well one of these must be real or authentic and one of these must not be. 

00:48:00
LARRY ZUCKER Mm-hmm. 

00:48:05
ALI BORDEN And I, I'm wanting to make space for all of them to be fair and real and true and some of them might be preferred and not preferred. Some of them you might follow through on and some of them you might not but the more space there is for a lot of different experiences then people don't feel totalized by that feeling. This isn't the all of me. Then there's lots more spaces for choices and there's lots of more space for a different sense of identity cuz it's like, oh I'm many different things. 

00:48:30
LARRY ZUCKER Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:48:30
ALI BORDEN I am someone who is restricted and who wants to get better. I'm someone who's still purging and wants to get better. 

00:48:40
LARRY ZUCKER And the journey that you're talking about is a journey away from reductionism towards complexity - 

00:48:45
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:48:45
LARRY ZUCKER - away from you know, having to be a secular being with a s-- with a, a, a clear you know, I this and I'm not this. 

00:48:50
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:48:50
LARRY ZUCKER Right, and more towards multiplicity. Well I'm this and I'm this. And it sounds like a lot of what you do is help people move towards that notion of being in conversation with you and towards that notion of being in conversation with life. 

00:49:05
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm, absolutely. There's a certain amount of acceptance in it without passivity at the same time. Do you wanna go oh? It's, ah, it's understandable and okay that I'm here. That doesn't mean that I have to do nothing about it. 

00:49:20
LARRY ZUCKER Right. 

00:49:20
ALI BORDEN That doesn't mean - 

00:49:20
LARRY ZUCKER Right 

00:49:20
ALI BORDEN - that I don't have desires. 

00:49:20
RIVKA It's really helping me. It's-- and we've talked about this a lot, is not, uhm, it that I can be many things at once. 

00:49:30
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:49:30
RIVKA Like-- and that has really helped me. That I don't have to cho-- this is not my authentic self and my inauthentic self and I'm you know, I can feel both love and hate or at the same time and they're both true. 

00:49:40
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:49:40
RIVKA And I don't have to chose between the two. 

00:49:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:49:45
RIVKA So that's been really helpful because it's a bit of a paradigm shift. From-- cuz I would always ask myself. The question would be like, what's my real self thinking and it's the bad one and then - 

00:49:55
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:49:55
RIVKA - my, my super ego, whatever is trying to put this other thing on it - 

00:49:55
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:50:00
RIVKA - and that's kind of the inner dialogue I had. And then to just allow myself to have both - 

00:50:00
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:50:05
RIVKA - has been tremendously helpful because-- and it seems right. Like, now I get it and it seems true, it feels true - 

00:50:10
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:50:10
RIVKA - but before I didn't even know that was an option - 

00:50:10
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:50:10
RIVKA - you know and that, that, just that has helped me so much. 

00:50:15
ALI BORDEN So how was that being conveyed to you? How do you like, how do you-- did like is it just that, ah, I've said things that you're allowed to have both - 

00:50:20
RIVKA Right. 

00:50:20
ALI BORDEN - you know, or is there other ways that, that you sort of come to that, that, uhm... 

00:50:30
RIVKA I think I've witnessed both in other people. 

00:50:30
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:50:30
RIVKA Ah, like in the kids I babysit, uhm, - 

00:50:35
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:50:35
RIVKA - in friends and, and when you, when you kinda raise the possibility first they just watch for it if that makes sense. Like I, I, I ask myself, "Oh, maybe it's possible that I'm experiencing both." Could that be possible - 

00:50:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:50:50
RIVKA - that they're both true? And then produce signals like yes, actually. That's what it feels like. 

00:51:00
9 Beyond behaviors: helping client's develop a complex sense of improvement and recovery in their lives Recovery: not a pre-determined destination DSM ideas imply recovery is absence of diagnosis Curious about clients' ideas about improvement Recovery is not static but based on small life decisions Small specific goals allow for small specific choices Recovery is... small steps on many different continuums 

00:51:05
ALI BORDEN Recovery is not a predetermined destination. It's-- the way that it's set up, ah, in, in the DSM is the absence or a diagnosis and IE would be a, be above, ah, 85% of your body weight. It would be not bending and purging but I like to resist attachment to that specific behavioral outcome and be more curious with clients about what would be an improvement to them. And then I wanna also resist I-- at the idea that that is something that's static and permanent. I wanna work with clients to know that they're moving, that they're decidings, making small decisions about what they want their life to look like, ah, and that there are all kinds of continuums. That they're moving closer or farther away from those goals that they have and those are all very specific like a specific pair of, of prescription glasses as opposed to clunky, pre-determined goal that, that just don't really fit people. 

00:52:05
ALI BORDEN How did-- what recovery was gonna look like for you or how did you start to develop a picture of where you were headed. Was there a-- did you feel like that was something you got a voice in or did that sound like something that ye-- was already pre-determined and how did that relate to food and weight versus the other things 

00:52:20
TESSA I don't feel like it was predetermined. I feel like the level of our recovery-- I feel like people started talking about levels of recovery. 

00:52:25
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:52:25
TESSA Uhm, one thing I should say, the first difference was I-- the other programs that I've been in they didn't believe that you could be recovered. It was just that you were going to be in recovery - 

00:52:35
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:52:35
TESSA - and struggling and you know some did like, the 12 steps and I didn't really know at the time but that was always kinda depressing to me. 

00:52:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:52:45
TESSA Uhm, and coming to EDTC and knowing that like, you guys believed you could be recovered and be done with it - 

00:52:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:52:50
TESSA - like, that was huge. I still didn't know if I could do it. 

00:52:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:52:50
TESSA Like, I'd be one of those but the fact it could done, that was, I think the first part that made me go, "Okay, I really want that." 

00:53:00
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:53:00
TESSA Uhm, and then the different levels, it was-- there was a baseline you had to get to like with food and weight so you could be healthy and you know, survive in the real world and like have a job and stuff. But what that-- what your relationship with food and exercise and even like you body size wasn't, that wasn't like you're 5'11" it has to be here and this is what your food has to look like. Uhm, it felt more like I get to chose. 

00:53:25
ALI BORDEN Mmm. 

00:53:25
TESSA Like how much do I want it in my life or not in my life and, and everyone got to pick their own levels. 

00:53:30
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:53:35
ALI BORDEN So what, what do you feel? Tell me, I can't help but want to pull a little bit of your life in. Like what do you feel like you're more connected to now. 

00:53:40
RIVKA Everything. Well I think one of the best things for me is, uhm, that I mentioned before but ha-- has been being in relationships. 

00:53:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:53:50
RIVKA And there-- it just feels incredibly nourishing - 

00:53:55
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:53:55
RIVKA - you know, which is a funny word to use. 

00:53:55
ALI BORDEN Yeah, yeah. 

00:53:55
RIVKA But it does, it feels like nourishing to my soul and I feel so engaged in these relationships, friendships and I started dating for like the first time in my life and it's really exciting for me to be entering into life - 

00:54:10
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:54:10
RIVKA - in all different areas. I feel-- and I feel valued and all of the things that I was. I thought maybe I could get from my anorexia and then couldn't - 

00:54:20
ALI BORDEN Mmm. 

00:54:20
RIVKA - and finding that I can get in life. 

00:54:20
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:54:20
RIVKA - and there's way more risk involved but it feels totally worth it you know. 

00:54:25
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. It's, it feels like there's also now that as you moved into life there's something at stake, like that you've had a taste of, - 

00:54:35
RIVKA Mm-hmm. 

00:54:35
ALI BORDEN - uhm, you know, these are the joke with anorexia. First taste is free and then it gets really hard. 

00:54:40
RIVKA Right. 

00:54:40
ALI BORDEN You know, you just rush at the beginning but it feels like with, with your-- it's harder to get that first taste of life - 

00:54:45
RIVKA Mm-hmm. 

00:54:45
ALI BORDEN - that your I-- ex-- I experienced you as out there living it and that you miss it if it was gone. 

00:54:50
RIVKA Yeah, oh terribly. 

00:54:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:54:55
RIVKA And it-- when I first like, you know, gained my weight and whenever I thought like I don't know if I could tolerate this body even if I have a great life. Like I'm not sure that this body is tolerable no matter-- even if someone paid me a million dollars. 

00:55:05
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. 

00:55:05
RIVKA You know, I don't know if I can do it. 

00:55:05
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:55:05
RIVKA And like, slowly I, I just kind of thought, "Okay, I'm gonna put the body on the back burner cuz what can I really about that?" And if I, if I'm focused on losing weight then that could really lead me back into - 

00:55:20
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:55:20
RIVKA - an eating disorder. So I'm gonna just try to build a life and then see what happens with the body thing. 

00:55:25
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:55:25
RIVKA And now I feel like my life is getting-- growing and growing and it feels more and more important and my body feels less and less important. 

00:55:35
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:55:35
RIVKA It's not like I like my body now and I'm like, "Oh, I'm just like so hot." 

00:55:35
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:55:35
RIVKA You know? But it's just like my life is getting more and more compelling and my body is getting less and less - 

00:55:45
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:55:45
RIVKA - important. 

00:55:45
ALI BORDEN So do you have any sense about how, again like, what-- as what kinds of conversations - 

00:55:50
RIVKA Mm-hmm. 

00:55:50
ALI BORDEN - helped you to start to wanna blow on ambers of your life and that naturally sort of shrunk. 

00:55:55
RIVKA Yeah, I think for me, not focusing the body was helpful versus talking about it too much cuz - 

00:56:00
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:56:00
RIVKA - talking about it just reinforce for me like it's, it, it's, it's horrible you know? 

00:56:05
ALI BORDEN Uh-huh. That's awful. 

00:56:05
RIVKA It's horrible. So yeah, so focusing on the things that I wanna and feeling connected to other people and opening up. 

00:56:15
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:56:15
RIVKA And, and also being engaged in those equal relationships where I felt like I was giving something to other person and they were giving something to me. 

00:56:25
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:56:25
RIVKA Uhm, And then I just got more connected to people - 

00:56:25
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:56:30
RIVKA - and more then more invested in that you know. 

00:56:30
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:56:30
RIVKA And it's hard to be invested before you have it. 

00:56:30
ALI BORDEN Yeah, it's hard to believe that there's-- it's possible. 

00:56:35
RIVKA Yeah. 

00:56:35
ALI BORDEN Like that feels such a, a, a leap right there because so many people feel like it's-- yeah, other people could even if they know other recovered people. 

00:56:40
RIVKA Mm-hmm. 

00:56:40
ALI BORDEN They go, "Yeah they can recover but somehow I can't - 

00:56:45
RIVKA Mm-hmm. 

00:56:45
ALI BORDEN I'm broken." But it feels like you started to, you started to move into life and experiment and with the dating going I never could have imagined myself being-- sitting here at this restaurant - 

00:56:55
RIVKA Right. 

00:56:55
ALI BORDEN - eating with this guy, you know? 

00:56:55
RIVKA Yeah. 

00:56:55
ALI BORDEN Like it was beyond possibility. 

00:57:00
RIVKA It was totally beyond what I would have thought for myself. 

00:57:00
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:57:00
RIVKA But it was a-- it was, ah, it was that thing about anorexia being so bad so I'm just gonna risk life. 

00:57:10
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:57:10
RIVKA So I'm gonna risk it in friendships, I'm gonna risk it in work, I'm gonna risk it in school or whatever. All these different areas because if I'm gonna do that, if I'm gonna try this recovery thing I'm gonna try it all the way. 

00:57:20
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:57:20
RIVKA And, uhm, and I'm not at really like a half measures person. 

00:57:25
ALI BORDEN Yeah. 

00:57:25
RIVKA So... 

00:57:25
ALI BORDEN What do you think would have been missed about you if people had written you off as broken or, uhm, chronic or hadn't really explored all those other things? Is that too hard of a question? 

00:57:40
TESSA No, you mean like what... 

00:57:40
ALI BORDEN Like who else are you. 

00:57:45
TESSA Who else am I? 

00:57:45
ALI BORDEN Like what, what, what, what did Beverly come to discover about you? You know, what did you feel like people knew you for about what you care about - 

00:57:50
TESSA Oh my God. 

00:57:50
ALI BORDEN - ah, if someone should - 

00:57:50
TESSA So... 

00:57:50
ALI BORDEN - never ask those questions, what would they have missed? 

00:57:55
TESSA Everything. I feel like, I mean I honestly feel like-- because I would have missed it too like I've been lo-- I didn't-- and I don't think I knew myself at all and I really feel like, it's like before EDTC and after EDTC. It's like two different people that I can look back on what I was, who I was then but it feels weird because it almost-- it feel like it just doesn't fit like trying to put on a dress that doesn't fit me anymore. Like I just can't even imagine it because I didn't know that I'm someone who like-- I now you're being relationist, ah, but relationships really are huge for me - 

00:58:25
ALI BORDEN Yeah, yeah. 

00:58:25
TESSA But I'm someone who cares at relationships, that I'm someone who-- I'm really tenacious, I'm, I'm accountable, I-- and I like myself you know, and I, I'm, I have really good friends, I, I'm a hard worker, I'm dedicated, I'm loyal, I'm-- I think I have perseverance like all these things like that that I think I didn't know. 

00:58:50
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:58:50
TESSA I don't think anyone else would have known because I mean if I didn't know it I don't know if anyone-- if we were exploring it. 

00:58:55
ALI BORDEN Yes. 

00:58:55
TESSA I don't think anyone could have found it - 

00:58:55
ALI BORDEN Mm-hmm. 

00:58:55
TESSA - but it just-- I think it would have missed who I am. I would have not had a chance to learn who I am an I feel like because of this and because of the world I started to do at EDTC and what I continue to do, I've gotten to really know and learn who I am and it helps me function in the world and it helps me keep moving forward.
