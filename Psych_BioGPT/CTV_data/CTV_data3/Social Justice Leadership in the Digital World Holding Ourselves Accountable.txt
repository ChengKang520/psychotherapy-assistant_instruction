MARIE Now I'd like to introduce this year's recipient of the Social Justice Action Award. Dr. Patricia Arredondo. I've known Patricia from my very first year in graduate study, in Counseling Psychology. Patricia is someone that everyone in the fields of counseling and psychology knows. Either, you've heard of her, you've met her, you've read her, you've listened to her. Indeed, Patricia was here 33 years ago on that snowy first Round Table. No one has reached as many people as Patricia and helped drive social change in our field. Patricia helped organize the very first set of multicultural guidelines and that took 20 years for the American Psychological Association to approve, just 20 years. I mean, that is an entire generations worth of scholars. She is now leading the efforts to update the guidelines and I certainly hope and I just know she will make that task happen and I think it's already been a few years in process. Patricia also helped re-found the National Latino Psychological Association, inviting each of, those of us personally to get involved and encouraging us to see ourselves as potential leaders of our communities. Patricia's emphasis always has been servant leadership. After the role model of no one less than the Reverend Martin Luther King. Simply put a servant leader is someone who is there for the people only. That is the peoples needs are an end in and of themselves rather than a means to an organizational purpose or that good old fashioned bottom line. Servant leadership is hallmark of the way Patricia impacts any organization with whom she interacts by emphasizing the sharing of power, the empowerment of all group members and the inclusion of communities in all aspects of organizational functioning. Patricia has provided a constant and caring guide to many of us in the field who have been called or inspired to serve the profession through social justice advocacy. In our APA division, 45 presidential talk, she referred to Latinos who are Santas and Marquesas, saints and royalty. As she writes, this seemingly contradictory term, the two terms together refers to contemporary Latinos who continuously attempt to balance saintliness and goodness with dignity and a sense of nobility. She also quoted the words of the famous poet Julia de Burgos which fit Patricia herself so well and that is, "I wanna be what men want me to be" an attempt at life obscuring my real being, but I was a woman of the here in and I could not retreat. I had to go forward humored by the ironies of the old roads and scripts in order to reach the new pathway. And now it's my pleasure to introduce Dr. Patricia Arredondo. Please join me in giving her rousing welcome.

PATRICIA ARREDONDO When I started this and I'm very humbled by your introduction, very high uh… it's very heartwarming. And, you know, standing here in front of all of you and I want to congratulate Dr. Heppner uh… for his word today too, we have been colleagues uh… co constructing at times. Umm… pathways for kind of liberation of, of sorts here, uh… in the profession. And being here at Teacher's College is uh… very special because it's an early part of my career development uh… as Marie said I was here in uh… 1983, for the first Teachers' College Conference which seems kind of mind blowing uh… when I consider that it was 33 years ago. Uh… but I knew then as a junior professor, how terribly important it was to be part of a movement. I didn't even know it was a movement. But, to be part of a collective of people who wanted to advance multiculturalism in counseling and in psychology. And back then, you know, I was in Boston, I was at Boston University and as we say umm… sometimes in, in Spanish, you know, uh, well uh… the expression is, you know, like you're sort of the only little mouse in the room or something like that. But coming to teachers college back then gave me a sense of connection with other people who had many of the same values, many of the same ideals uh… to put culture in the midst of our work. And my comments today are really… I guess a continuation of my uh… journey in this world of social justice leadership uh… and multiculturalism. A few years ago at uh… an American Counseling Association Conference I was asked to give a small talk about the difference between social justice and multicultural competency. And I tried not to umm… you know… I had to catch my breath and I said, well, okay, I'd be happy to talk about it umm… and of course what I, I ended up saying is that, you cannot talk about multiculturalism as a force in counseling and psychology without appreciating our roots in social justice leadership. And so there's a, a way that our field has evolved. Oh, good. Okay, good you get it, okay. Our, our field has evolved and why we have to always I… and you'll see in my comments, why we have to put our history in front of us? Uh… we cannot afford to be a historical, otherwise we leave behind umm… the, the people who really gave birth and gave breath to what we're doing here today at this new conference that focuses on the digital era. And I congratulate Marie for putting herself out there on, on having us talk about the digital world and I'm, I'm talking about it here about holding ourselves accountable in the digital world as social justice leaders. In my estimation, we all are capable of being social justice leaders and in fact we all are social justice leaders if we're here at this conference, this weekend. Uh… it is… my premises around that are, are as follows. You know, we're all mental health professionals and as mental health professionals uh… we are engaged in systems and systems that we have to in fact take responsibility to change, to break down the barriers that marginalize individuals, marking marginalized communities, marginalized groups. Well, our responsibility as mental health professionals is to do the work informed by the historical and current realities, informed by social justice leadership principles which I'll be talking about. Cultural competencies, leadership worldviews and of course examples of social action that have impact. So this is our responsibility. And I believe that our preparation as mental health professionals makes us the individuals who have both the privilege as well as the knowledge umm… the credentials umm… but also I believe we get into our field because we care. We care about people, we care and we're committed, but that caring has to again take on systems to promote equity, to promote equality, to promote access, to promote inclusion. I also recognize that the digital world is a small means of doing that. Uh… it can in fact be a means of information sharing, it can be a means of empowerment. But as we also know it can be a means of marginalizing. It can be a means of stereotyping and causing harm. And many of us have been at the receiving end of marginalization through the use of social media. We can see ourselves in some of the images that are part of the umm… uh… slander I guess, you would say that's going on in the presidential campaign right now of, of who gets demonized and how I see myself in some of those images of people who are demonized because of national heritage, because of religion, uh… because of sexual orientation. So as I, as we say, we're never uh… we're never escaping um… the experiences of others because it's all, we all part of the human condition and we have to recognize our responsibility as such. There are a number of headlines that I know, have captured all of us over the last few months, the last few weeks and, and I'll just mention some of those headlines because in many respects uh… we've shared in the reaction to them, and the response to them, umm… in, in, in a social action form. So, if I say the Hoffman Report. Okay, if I say Flint Michigan. Pretty gray! Building the wall higher than it is now. Okay, extending it in building the wall higher, denying entry to those who are suspected of being Muslim. You've heard that headline? And other vitriolic commentary that demonizes the disenfranchised already. Those are the headlines we are all assailed by every day. And for me these are compelling evidence as to why our social leadership so just… social justice leadership is even more important today. Our sensibilities are affected. How many of you have seen the video of Laquan McDonald's murder? You know it, it's one of those riveting of videos that just continues to uh… hurt my heart. And, you know, I didn't want to see it at first because everyone told me how awful it was, and it is awful. It is awful. But it's that inhumanity umm… that I see. And I'd like to think that we're, you know, we have more humanity among us, but yet it is that in humanity. We talked about this. Dr. Parham have commented umm… at the end of his talk just before this one of the, the… A 10 year old boy who was killed by the police in Cleveland. And umm… again the, the whole idea that he was told three times to, to stop and he didn't stop and then he was shot and killed uh… but there is some evidence that actually the window of the police car wasn't rolled down so the child could not have heard that he was told to stop or put down whatever the toy gun was that he had in his hand. So all of these affect our sensibilities, but they also affect the community in which this violence occurs. Last week, I was in Phoenix and there's a big story on the news umm… about a social media image that had gone viral. These young high school girls were dressed like cheerleaders and they had spelled out the N word across them. Did you hear about that? Okay.

00:13:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO And, you know, I, again, what is the responsibility of, of a school of uh… to educate our children in terms of respectful behavior uh… of language that hurts, of language that harms and then it comes back to us in terms of our accountability as professionals and a feel that knows what it's like to umm… have, have that kind of a sale man to your being occur. For me, our role as, as mental health professionals, as that we have to care about the mental health not only of our students. But, as educators, as researchers, practitioners, organizational leadership, organizational leaders, social justice leadership is integral to our professional identity. Social justice leadership is integral to our professional identity. And as a result we must dedicate ourselves to, to minister to the mental, the physical, and spiritual well being in order to address inequities and inequalities in groups and communities. We could look at digital- the use of digital technology in 2016. And of all its applications as a way to promote positive change through more rapid modes of communication. We've talked about that throughout this, this conference. And actually one we think, when I think back you know, what Dr. Martin Luther King did in order to mobilize the marches. There was no social media at the time, but he could mobilize people. Uh… when I think back about the migrant farm worker marches umm… there was no social media uh… it was all boots on the ground literally. Oh, today, we have advantages through technology to mobilize and to address the oppressive systems because as I'm always reminded by Dr., Dr. King's quote. "Injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere." And right now we are flooded with injustices. So injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere. So we are at this epidemic I think milestone with injustices. I also believe that as mental health professionals, we also have to how hold our profession accountable. We have to hold our professions of psychology, counseling, social work accountable. When we embarked on writing the multicultural competencies for the American, for the Association of Multicultural Counseling and Development, it took ACA the parent organization of AMCD 20 years to formally endorse them. That's embarrassing, that's embarrassing. The multicultural guidelines were endorsed at this the same year 2002, but it took 20 years from which those first 10 guidelines were written by Derald(ph) and company. We have to continue to hold our professions accountable for what we're doing in the area of systems change because, those organizations also have to change. So we know that social justice leadership is not something new, but at the same time I think it's important for us to kind of look at where we fit into this from our own, what I always think about in terms of our competency development in order to take action in ways that are informed uh… and in ways that are impactful. Many of you are familiar I hope with the multicultural counseling competencies by now and the paradigm of awareness knowledge and skills that goes back to 92 and then the 96 version. I adapted this little model to look at social justice leadership because similarly I think with social justice leadership we have to think about what it means, what it, how we define it and what it represents to us as mental health professionals. Cognitively what is our mindset about social justice leadership? Do we think about it as something that someone else does who has more power and authority? Do we see how we can align with others in the profession? Do we know of actual experiences we have had as social justice leaders and the effects of those actions? I mind, uh… I'm reminded of some things that I did early in my career that I guess you could now look at as social justice interventions. I just didn't know they were. Uh… my whole premise I think my career has been… If I see and it in equity taking place I try to figure out what to do about that. Kind off I, I step into a situation and problem solve it or find other people to help me. I usually find other people to help me, because I, I know that I can't effect change by myself. But, many years ago I was a high school counselor working with immigrant students and I, I began to see uh… some of the ways the school was handling these children and their families was, were in fact violating their civil rights. And there were agencies that we were working with and I just happened to be talking to the folks from the agencies and I said… I told them that I thought some things were just not proper that were going on. And umm… I left it up to them and, you know, in a month or so uh… the Office of Civil Rights was at the school uh… making inquiries about how the students were, were being entered into the system, how they were being treated in the system and so forth. Uh… now you could say, I took the coward's way out by talking to the agencies, but they were my collaborators, they were the parent, they were the agencies that brought the families to the school. I also knew that I could lose my job, right, if I could, if I went right to the office of Civil Rights. But, I think my point is that, seeing things and knowing that there are other people who care about the injustices… Is, is, it reminds me that it's always necessary to, to uh… work with those people who also would feel that those and justices are, are not ones that we should let uh… continue. So the self-awareness piece about what social justice leadership means to me. Do I believe I have the, the knowledge? Do I believe I have the authority? Do I have… Do I believe I, I'm a leader? You know, I said already I think we're all leaders, but I think you have to own that as well umm… that you're prepared to be a leader. I also think the second premise is umm… knowledge is competence. Umm… knowledge of systemic barriers, you could look around those of you who are students or faculty or anyone who were employed somewhere, but look at the systemic barriers in your institution. How are they benefiting certain people? How are they excluding certain people? You know, how do those barriers serve to create what we call chilly climates in organizations. Umm… And I think about universities in particular, because they're the ones that are supposed to be the equalizing agent for us because you, you know, education is power and education helps many of us advance, but we know that a lot of systemic barriers in educational institutions. What we also need to be aware of in terms of competence is, as I said earlier what, what the guidelines, what the multicultural guidelines and multicultural competencies tell us? The multicultural competencies were originally designed for practice to really help us understand how to better work in counseling situations with an individuals from ethnic and racial minority backgrounds. And, the new multicultural guidelines, the expanded ones are embedded with social justice principles. So if you haven't seen those, you can get them from the ACA website. So, it's multi… multicultural and social justice competencies, now published by ACA and those flew through thankfully, those were adopted this summer by the Governance Group. Let me tell you a little something about multi… the multicultural guidelines and it's only because I'm a bit of an agitator and, and, umm… why I think it's been important to just kind of share this information. A lot of the, of the guidelines are uh… areas of specialty within APA have always been practice areas. Umm… and I was approached in, I think 1999 or something like that to work on the new multiculture… multicultural guidelines for APA. And uh… I was pretty busy and I don't know I was in a kind of a state that I, I didn't want to do something that I, I didn't believe in and I asked about the nature of these guidelines and they said they were going to be practice guidelines, and I know, Puncky, you may have heard this already. And I said, well, I'm not gonna write practice guidelines. I said that's, that's a waste of time. I said, we have to have education and training. We have to talk about competency, cultural competency in doing research, in assessments, practice, yes, but also in the organization. You know what are organizations doing to create and reduce bare… to reduce barriers, not to create barriers, to reduce barriers. So, you know the multicultural guidelines are about education and training, research, practice and organizational change. And I don't want to take, you know, uh… more credit than I need to for that, but I insisted that I wouldn't write these unless we had a comprehensive view of what the field needed in order to promote cultural competency. Those are things that I have, have done to kind of stick my neck out because I believe in it and, you know, you, in order to do something that you're passionate about uh… and believe in you really also sometimes have to hold other people accountable and this was my way of holding other people accountable. Now there are other forms of knowledge we need in order to know where to intervene in terms of social action and, and so I want to talk about that for a minute. And share with you some depressing data. Umm… I had to do a paper last fall on, on some of the factors that stigmatized people in the United States and create umm… mental health distress. So if we talk about poverty, there's a lot of data on poverty uh… to share. But in the state of Arizona, 52% umm… of families are considered to be living in poverty. 52% of the families in Arizona are considered to be living in poverty and the majority of those families are of, of course going to… In Arizona anyway are going to be of Mexican or Latino heritage and American Indian. Oh, that's, that's the state of Arizona that is also, as we know one of the worst states when it comes to immigration umm… and their rhetoric umm… and actions about deportation. According to the 2016 Federal Poverty Guidelines, to be eligible for benefits, a family of four cannot have a household earning, cannot have household earnings of more than $24,250 annually. $24,250 annually is the poverty line for a family of four. Can't do much. Okay. The real average hourly earnings from 2015 to 2016 increased by 1.1%. So we're, were people in general are not making a greater income this year than they were last year. And we know that there's a lot of movement in certain states to increase the hourly rate to$15 an hour, I think the State of Washington has gone there. But, it's like were, were employers or, or even the state is acting as though it's umm… a great burden. Hate crimes and anti-government patriot groups. If you don't read the Southern Poverty Law Institute newsletter, yeah, you need to read the Southern Poverty Law Institute newsletter and become a supporter. Because they have some of the most powerful data about injustices, racism, and other forms of uh, of oppression in the country. But these are a couple of figures that recently were released. Hate groups increased by 14% in 2015. Hate groups increased by 20, by 14% in the year 2015. So we now have 892 hate groups, register hate groups in the US. And then we have anti-government patriot groups. And remember when the patriot umm… legislation was passed at 2002 after 9/11. So we now have patriot groups, they also grew by 14% and they are now 998 such groups in the United States. Patriot groups that are, these are all anti-government groups, okay? You understand that, they're, they, they are they're people who do not like the way the system operates because there are too many people like me, like some of you who are part of the system and they're opposed to that and let alone letting others and that look like us. Uh… wouldn't it be great if we had 998 registered social justice leadership organizations in this country? Okay, maybe that's what we ought to be advocating for and working towards because, you know, we've got to counterbalance these folks. I mean, we've got to find ways that we're not doing it just in ACA or APA or at our universities, but we have to think about this at the national level, social justice leadership organizations nationally. Let me just take, give you a couple other depressing uh… comments in terms of… I'm sorry, I mean… but these are facts so you know where to intervene, right, okay. Homelessness, US child homelessness is at an all time high. US child homelessness is at an all time high. One in every 30 or 2.5 million children was homeless in 2014. This is United States. Okay, homeless children and what we are blaming here is poverty, the lack of affordable housing uh… racial disparities, unattended effects of domestic violence among other causes. There are plenty of places where we can intervene. And then I want to mention also the LGBT situation. Uh… what we know is that LGBT populations, especially youth have the highest rates of tobacco, alcohol and other drug use. Youth are more likely to be homeless. And coming out for them, put, the youth puts them at risk and of course they are often the targets of bulling. In South Dakota, there was some legislation being passed at a… Some legislation being passed about the use of transgender bathrooms, to not allow transgender bathrooms, that's what it was in South Dakota, that's just this week, the last two days. Uh… you know, there, there are these inhuman uh… decisions that are made by state legislation. So what we have of course is that also that African-American women incarcerated, that to me is just an ugly figure because they're not only more incarcerated, their sentences are longer, they're separated from, from their children and then there's no way that there's a rehabilitation plan when, when the women are in prison. So I could go on and, and share with you more of these awful uh… data points uh… plus all of the anti-immigration legislation that's currently umm… proposed in the State of Wisconsin and the State of Arizona. They are working hand in hand, it seems right now. So we have a lot to do. And I think we, action can be found in different forms. So when I think about social justice leadership paradigms, I believe they have to be community centered, obviously collectivistic because that's what the multicultural and social justice orientations are about, the worldview is about collectivists, the good of the whole. Inclusive, participatory and empowering. Collectively we empower one another. I have found everything that I've done in my career that has been in the name of, of change umm… that is often social justice related is because I've done it with other people. And, and I don't ever see that is changing for me. Umm… social justice um… paradigms also involves creating new systems and organizational change. When I went to Arizona State University, we adopted the multicultural competencies in our department as a calling card for future students. We put it on our website. There are many, many things you can do to create change in your own local units. Umm… Yes, of course about liberation and acknowledging the experiences of the marginalized communities where we live, where we work. And again, it's about being a servant leader, having impact as a servant leader. So I think I went backwards. No, I guess supposed to go forward. Okay, Marie, I think I hit a wrong button here. Okay. Here we go. You're all familiar with the Bronfenbrenner Ecological Model. It's an important one to take into account when we're doing social justice leadership work. Because it tells us that while we have a micro level where we always will work with individuals and families it's the macro system we're trying to impact. The macro system can be society, the macro system can be your community. What happened in Chicago with the marches, the police chief ended up resigning or being told he had to go. I mean, those, that there's power in coming together collectively and that to affect the macro system. Very simple ideas here about social justice actions that can contribute to inclusiveness access and systems change. I've already talked about the institutional level and what can be done on campuses, at large or in departments to create change. Umm… probably all of you have participated in some uh… campus activity. My colleagues here from the University of Missouri have probably a very close and upfront understanding of what has gone on when uh… a leadership does not listen to its constituencies. We need to do that at departmental levels too, but we also can do this through our teaching and our supervision to instruct to lead our students to understand the principles of social justice that they can themselves embody and enact. Community interventions, aligning with external allies. Now a lot of people talk about lobbying uh… taking on legislation uh… in order to create change. But in order to do that we have to be prepared, we have to be able to understand what it means to lobby. You don't just say, I'm going to try and advocate for this bill, but there is a methodology to lobbying and if that's something you want to become involved with, there's, there's some lessons to be learned and there's some teaching that you can follow with, with that. So they are many things I could say about social uh… social justice action, but some of you are probably already engaged with it. Okay. So I want to talk just for the last slide here about celebrating social justice leadership in a digital world. You know, it's uh… Some of these are very heartwarming, because what it reminds me uh… when I read about some of these actions is how social media can in fact empower more of us. All of you have read about the horrible story in Flint Michigan and what continues to be a mess of lies umm… from the governor about what they knew was going on in terms of the water contamination and what they chose to do umm… to communities of color that were already disenfranchised particularly African-American communities. But last week a story came out about this little boy, I don't know, maybe you can remind me, it's North Carolina? Anyway he read about the situation in Flint and he told his mother, he wanted to buy bottled water to ship it. Well, it was too expensive to do that. So they figured out that the children still needed some other umm… umm… ways to maintain sanitation in the schools. So, so they… He got a campaign, he raised I think about $10,000 to buy hand sanitizers uh… for these schools in, uh, in Flint. And it's like… This, this is a good feel good story, but why… You know, we've got to replicate that and, and more people can be doing that. You can take a small idea and, and that can go viral. The Black Friday marches in Chicago were powerful. Uh… they had economic impact. Uh… they sent a message in the city, not only to the visitors of the city unfortunately you could say, but also more, more to the, to the government, to the city government and we're still, I think we're not done seeing changes there, I see my friends here from Chicago uh… who have been activists in that umm… in those marches umm… and, and know that there's more to come. The black lives matter movement should continue. Uh… I mean, clearly of the transgressions uh… are… around… towards African-American males are ones that are, are just we're not, we continue to see them. We continue to see them. Umm… what has also been positive is the uh… Asian American Pacific Asso… Pacific Islander Association statement on Michael Brown and Eric Garner, there are a lot of our ethnic minority associations made public statements, not only about the Hoffman Report, but about some of the injustices uh… that have seen this summer. The psychologies push for social justice and I went on the website to see how much social justice showed up on the APA website. And it didn't show up a lot. Okay, I have to say, didn't show up a lot. And the one big one, one big place it showed up was 2011 that was when Melba Vasquez was President of APA and her whole agenda was around immigration, that was were more social justice uh… identifiers were, where I found them. So I'm just pointing out that obviously there's a lot and a lot of work to do and I see some of my colleagues from council there, sitting back there whoa! You are on council. Umm… who are advocating for inclusion, that would be a great social justice act on the part of the governing council of representatives. No day without Latinos recently happened in Madison Wisconsin. Who's here from Madison? Where y'all there? Yes, okay. Now, this is powerful. This is really powerful, but, you know, it's another act that shows how community umm… University, uh… agencies come together to address uh… legislation that's anti-immigrant. And what's important that and this is what legislators don't get in terms of economic impact and that's probably the way you're going to get most attention is that, 40% of dairy industry… The industry in, in uh… Wisconsin, 40% is dairy. Okay. Who works in the dairies? Okay, it's all Latino immigrants. All right, so one day without those Latino immigrants or Latino people showing up to work in the dairy industry cost them a lot of money. So you have to look at this in terms of the impact it can have umm… to get people's attention, but economics is often the impact. Umm… and then there's the White House Task Force on new Americans. I, I just believe that so much of what President Obama has done to create inclusion and access gets so minimized, but this, this came out this summer his, his new plan on uh… new American umm… taskforce on new Americans that he wants to advocate for integrative uh… immigrant communities in the United States. And, you know, we can get on that as well. You can just visit the website and see what the possibilities are. And I just want to close by sharing with you and you don't have to read it all, but this summer when all of the Republican candidates rhetoric started going on about deporting everyone uh… who looks like me or building the wall higher uh… the national Latina, Latino Psychological Association decided to uh, put together a statement here. And essentially uh… what we're talking about is, is valuing the dignity of all Latinos and Latinos and that we would really uh… not tolerate derogatory statements about us. And we continue to denounce racist and otherwise derogatory messages and instead work to promote a social… social justice for all persons, particularly those who cannot readily speak for themselves. I'm very proud of us for, for making this statement and it's on our website. We also made a statement about the Hoffman Report and our position on, on our anti-tortured(ph) position. Uh… because we believe that's the way we take, we take responsibility is by making open statements by sharing those with, with our colleagues and, and making sure that we can in fact umm… leave some legacy behind to our students, to our communities. I want to thank all of you for indulging me at this hour. Uh… It's truly umm… a journey that I've been on in terms of social justice leadership action and advocacy that uh… I believe that I will continue to journey and I, I hope that I can continue to, to make a difference in small and big ways in the profession uh… in the community and society. Thank you very much.

00:42:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO It looks like… I loved it. Oh, my god. 

00:42:25
MARIE Well, I, I want to show you the plaque first. There's a plaque, fancy plaque. We also asked people in, in our award winners lives to share with us, comments, experiences, just their, their thoughts and feelings about the award winner. And so I'd like to read this for Patricia, it's a very special citation. As a highly respected scholar, educator, mentor, and leader in multicultural counseling, you have made enormous contributions to the field of psychology. You have broken down barriers and achieved success in both the business and academic worlds. Simply said, you have the qualities of a powerful and influential leader. You are focused, passionate, assertive, decisive, confident, self-aware and humble. Many people who are in positions of authority may call themselves leaders, but very few possess all of these attributes. I am proud to have known and worked with you over the years you are our hermana. (ph) You are a pioneer, a lot, a living legend according to a ACA, a fellow of APA, a multicultural elder, and the founder and madrina of the National Latino Psychological Association. You've served as President of several professional organizations including NLPA, the Association for Multicultural Counseling and Development and the American Counseling Association. Your impacts on the professions of psychology and counseling have been profound, through your courageous and visionary leadership, scholarship, teaching, training and academic administration. There is one word to sum up your work, Patricia, and it is the word you chose for your company, "Empowerment." You have shown us the way to, to help empower those who are marginalized and oppressed. Your work on the multicultural competencies and the multicultural guidelines have literally redefined what it means to help others. Patricia, you have spent your career empowering mentees to bring about change in their communities. You inspire us to dare to change and challenge the profession, but never for personal glory, but for the greater good. Patricia, you inspire people to leverage privilege and make the world a better place, in turn making others better people because of it. Society in the fields of psychology and counseling are better because of your influence and that's the essence of empowerment. You are generous, fertile, and inspiring Pachamama of Latino psychology in the US and beyond. You are the enduring, committed, supportive and caring madrina of every Latino psychologist counselor and ally at every state of their professional development. Be that student, early career, mid-career or senior professional, you have been the Pachamama and Patrira(ph) in the social justice causes of diversifying the mental health profession by recruiting, nurturing and promoting culturally competent and humble providers and leaders, and serving the needs of the Latino populations by affirming and disseminating their strengths. Our accomplishments have been possible by your indefatigable mentorship and inspirational role modeling. Many of us are professionals and better ones at that because of you. It is fitting that you should be recognized here at the Round Table, because you were here, you presented here at the first Round Table and have been one of the architects of the multicultural psychology movement. Indeed, you valued the Round Table as a place to deepen your connections with the people driving the multi cultural revolution and psychology. Your eyes reveal the battles, you have engaged in during your career as a psychologist and healer. And yet, your look always sharp, fresh, poised and proper. It says, I'm ready for more. To know you is to engage you as an instructor, corporate trainer, scholar, author, counselor, and administrator. And yet, to understand you at the depths of your soul is to know and understand that you are "Un Guerrero," a warrior. Your career has been one of distinction, not simply for the accolades you have received, but also for the positions you have taken and the advocacy you have gained, engaged and to fight for the under-represented, the undermine, the underclass, the underserved and the unheard. Your posture as a social justice advocate is also waged on multiple fronts for an addition to your Latino roots, from you springs a well of hard work and perseverance on behalf of all peoples of color. It is that manifest humanity that makes you such a beloved figure and one so deserving of the Social Justice Action Award, Patricia.

PATRICIA ARREDONDO Really it's amazing!

PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh… I'm just stunned. I'm just umm… beautifully written first of all, Marie. Umm… umm… very, very touching umm… And, you know, these are, these are moments where the, everyone in the room is my familia. And I, I feel close to everyone in the room for a lot of reasons, for different reasons, and it's very inspiring to be at a place where I… Again, I feel affirmed and, and that's terribly important. You may know, you may think, okay, she's done and all these things, but there are places it's important to be affirmed and, and this is one so…. umm… I love you all. "Gracias." That's why you're so big. 

00:48:20
MARIE Yeah. Thank you. Okay. 

00:48:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Okay. My god. 

00:48:25
MARIE Thank you, Patricia, humble as always. And now for the Janet E Helms Mentoring Award, which this year goes to Puncky Heppner. And as I've shared each year since being a Director of the Round Table, I was actually very privileged and honored to be at the very first Janet Helms Mentoring Award ceremony in 1991, just 26 years ago. And uh… the award was given to no other than Janet Holmes. And I was a graduate student at the University of Maryland program and I still remember driving up my little Honda with couple my friends umm… Oh, yeah, we managed to avoid the snow. It's always snow with Round Table. And anyways, it was just the most amazing, amazing uh… evening uh… and experience to see that. And, and frankly I think I was just too young really sometimes it to truly appreciate and grasp the impact of that. And it's actually, as the years have preceded that I've really come to understand what it means to be a mentor. And if you were able to listen to Dr. Heppner's presentation this afternoon at two, he really broke it down in terms of what it really means to be a mentor, how complex it is and how, you know, just to bring two individuals together to try and figure out how we're thinking, how we're feeling, how we can be on a plane together, so that each of us learn and grow. And so it's such a privilege to be here and to honor Dr. Heppner for all that he has done in psychology. He has so many qualities. He is both gentle, yet inquisitive, brilliant, yet kind and as his wife Mary knows who by the way is her own very incredible mentor, who was just recognized by 17 last year for being her own mentor. He's quite the toll package as they say. And so, it is with great joy that we here at the Round Table are able to find some meaningful way to honor this pioneering professional and give him the profess… the recognition he so much deserves. And so I also would like to read the citation for Dr. Heppner umm… and again, it was the same process where we invited people that Puncky has known and, and so I'd like to read that for, for you, Puncky. Whenever I think of you Puncky, I think of the words you have on your desk, "exclusion(ph) is easy, but inclusion is better." As it exemplifies how you have overcome many barriers and made many efforts to create an inclusive environment for everyone. Throughout my time working with you, I witnessed not only your commitment towards enhancing our scientific knowledge, but also your genuine care for people from different cultural backgrounds. You have taught me various ways to be an activist and actively promote multiculturalism in the community and in our lives. I've always appreciated our talks about the importance of an understanding psychology from multiple cultural perspectives in the moments when you shared your joy in working with people from various backgrounds. I've learned so much from you about having respect for differences and I can honestly say that your openness to people's intricacies, transcends language and culture. You've been an excellent mentor to many students and professionals and upon meeting you, I'm was impressed of what a genuine, humble and respectable mentor you are. Your gentle warm and supportive interpersonal style has made it so easy for people to talk to and connect with you. I remember that I felt so comfortable discussing my aspirations, thoughts and feelings with you when we first talked on the phone. And over the years in my interactions with others, so many people convey the same impression of you. Puncky, you were the most open-minded and caring mentors in our field. As a teacher, you not only care about students academic learning, but also students personal growth. I recall many discussions about how we could facilitate student development over our lunches and breaks. Students often shared how they felt comfortable talking to you about their own experiences in learning. Many of them expressed to me their confidence in your leadership, because you were and continue to be a great mentor. Your calming presence has made it easier for students to come to you, when they encounter challenges. A Chinese proverb about teachers says, "that a teacher is someone who teaches us the fundamental relationship between oneself and society." To help us develop the knowledge and skills to live as a good citizen in society and to guide us in our problem solving process which perfectly delineates your strategy as a teacher and mentor. I've learned much from you about conducting research on advocating for social justice. As a researcher, you model professionalism elegantly, as you always demonstrate excellent cultural sensitivity and competency in your scholarship. I have a great deal of respect for your work, ethic and vigorous research mind and I was very lucky to observe these qualities as your advisee. After one of our talks in Taiwan, audience, members and scholars told me that I had a wonderful teacher. I definitely agree with them and feel blessed to have such a great member, mentor. After I became a faculty member, I realized how much you've affected my teaching pedagogy and mentorship philosophy. I feel fortunate to have had the opportunities watching you teaching and interacting with students and other professionals. You've dedicated yourself to mentorship widely through teaching, research, consultation and service to the community and national organizations. And despite being so productive and involved, you amaze me with your level of responsiveness to all those around you. I recall that many times you helped me explore my own research and career paths in such a supportive, patient and caring way. You were also the first person who called me when a, when a catastrophic earthquake struck Taiwan to ask me how my family was. Bottom line, as an early career psychologist with many professional experiences to navigate ahead, I feel infinitely more confident in my ability to move forward in my professional development, in the ways that I would like in our congruent with my diversity and social justice values. Because I count you as one of my mentors, your guidance and support mean that much. Puncky, you demonstrate just how one can show competence and confidence in a humble way. Like the characteristics of bamboo in Chinese culture, firm in the root and stem, but flexible enough not to bend to hurt itself. And hollow between sections symbolizing space for more learning and different opinions. I am so happy you are receiving this honor, Puncky. It is well deserved, given your outstanding scholarship and contributions to mentoring numerous students around the world. Puncky.

PUNCKY HEPPNER Wow. Thank you. Oh, gosh. That was so powerful, so beautiful. Umm… I just have such deep gratitude for this award, it's, it's one of the most meaningful awards that I've received. Umm… because I think, as I was saying earlier in my talk, I think it's the most important thing that we do. But unfortunately uh… many times it doesn't count when it comes to races, you know, they look how many publications that you get, what's your TEQ's? Umm… so, I very much appreciate uh… the wisdom uh… of, of the Round Table and the people who started this. I, I think it um… reflects a great deal with them because we need to change the next generations. We need to prepare them, because we are going to have more and more problems as we go down this road and so I think it's critically important. Uh… so I thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart umm… this is uh… something that I will treasure for the rest of my life. Umm… and I, I just have such respect for the Round Table uh… Dr. Helen, Aval(ph) and I brought people here, students here for many years and it was always a place that would fill up our cups. Uh… a place where we could come and, and get reinforced for the way we were thinking about things, learn a great deal uh… and go home renewed and ready to continue on. And so I, the Round Table is just mean so much. Uh… I also know Janet Helms quite well. Uh… and it's a real honor to have an award in her name. She has been such an outstanding mentor to so many people uh… just blows me away. Umm… And I have… She has been a wonderful friend uh… and then very supportive of me over the years as well, and I have the utmost respect for her. And also it's very special to happen at, at Teachers College. Umm… I have such high respect for the faculty, the counseling psychology faculty and not only what they're doing, but their spirit uh… and the mission that they are on as a group. And so I'm very, very appreciative uh… for the reward here. So thank you very much. Thank you.
