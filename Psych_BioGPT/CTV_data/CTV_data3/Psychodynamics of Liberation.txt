JEFFREY MISHLOVE, Ph.D. 

00:00:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome. Our topic today is the psychodynamics of liberation. We're going to explore how it is that we get locked into a particular limited views of ourselves and how we can hope to ever transcend, to move beyond those, those small perspectives that we develop. With me today is Dr. Kathleen Speeth. Dr. Speeth is a member of the faculty of the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology in Menlo Park, California. She's a clinical psychologist in private practice and author of several books, many articles on human development and co-editor of a book called, 'The Essential Psychotherapies,' which she worked on with Dr. Daniel Goldman. Welcome, Kathy. 

00:01:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH I'm glad to be here. 

00:01:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's a pleasure to have you here again. We get stuck. We get limited. Every form of psychotherapy has its own diagnosis of, of what is, is the problem. How do we become neurotic? How do we become stuck. How, how is it that we see ourselves in our small, in our smallness and can't get beyond it? And then they all offer a, a way to get around it. 

00:01:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:01:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE What I'd like to begin to explore with you are some of the commonalities, some, some of the larger things that we can say about the whole issue of liberation and maybe a good way to lead into that is just to ask you what is your definition of liberation? 

00:01:50
KATHLEEN R.SPEETH, Ph.D. Transpersonal Psychologist 

00:01:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Well I don't know if we can hope to find complete liberation from whatever traps we're in, in this lifetime, but let's say we can move toward liberation. If we find ourselves freer rather than less free by whatever we understand about ourselves or whatever techniques we use from psychotherapy or from any other religious tradition or any other technological helps we can find in the culture, political even. 

00:02:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It, it seems as if in a sense that, you know, we're caught in, in so many veils of illusion that as soon as we break through one, say racism, then we run into another, sexism. 

00:02:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:02:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Or we run into another religious prejudice or we run into another, age prejudice. There, there's no end to, to the ways in, in which our perspectives are, are limited by particular situations. 

00:02:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:02:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And I suppose at some level maybe that's healthy. Maybe it would not be good for a human being to be fully liberated. How, how would one function? 

00:03:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Well, I suppose the most liberated person from your point of view, what you just described is a neonate, a tiny baby just born who, you know, experiences the world as a booming, buzzing confusion and doesn't have any con-, concepts to collect the world into observable things and repeatable experiences. 

00:03:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:03:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH But perhaps a free human being, a free and developed human being isn't like that. 

00:03:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:03:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Perhaps they, they can be free without giving up conceptualizations. 

00:03:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We, we certainly have ideal models of, of what this might be, especially from the Oriental traditions when they, they really do talk about spiritual liberations, spiritual enlightenment. 

00:03:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:03:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Completely unfettered by the bonds of karma or say sorrow... 

00:03:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:03:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Or illusions of various, various sorts and, and yet every time a so-called elightened, liberateed guru comes over to the West, you know, it's like the emperor wearing no clothes. It's easy to see their foibles. 

00:04:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. So you're disappointed? 

00:04:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:04:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. You feel betrayed. 

00:04:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I wonder personally if there is such a thing as enlightenment, really. 

00:04:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:04:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Or if it's, it's one of these, you know, like, hitch your wagon to the stars. 

00:04:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:04:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's a goal we ought to all strive for... 

00:04:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:04:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But which is, is not reallly, uh, attainable. 

00:04:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

00:04:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That there's something about the human condition itself which is, which is fundamental. 

00:04:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:04:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We, uh, existential reality, we're born alone, we- 

00:04:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:04:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We have to deal with death and alienation and no matter how much we practice yoga or meditation or build communities or begin to see through our, our foibles, we'll, we'll always be in these bodies, at least while we're alive. 

00:04:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. Well, that's undoubtedly true. Uh, there's a Sufi story about that. 

00:04:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:04:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Just basically the story is about Bahauddin Natuband (ph) who was the great Natubandi- 

00:04:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The founder of one of the major Sufi orders. 

00:05:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. And he materialized an apple, I don't know why, some demonstration of competence, and the apple had a worm in it and they said, 'Well, Bahauddin, you're so powerful that you can materialize an apple. How is it that you can't materialize a perfect apple?' He said that in this context, nothing can be perfect. All right? 

00:05:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:05:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH But it isn't just the Eastern meditative traditions that give us some help with liberation. I think that Western psychotherapeutic approaches are even more appropriate for us. 

00:05:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:05:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Even though I certainly have participated both rather a lot. 

00:05:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE My sense is that the Western approache is, is to sort of say, 'Well, look, you know, the world isn't perfect. We've got to live with it with it's problems,' and, and psychotherapy is often oriented towards adjusting, coping. 

00:05:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:05:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Dealing with, you know, how bad life really is. 

00:05:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Well, that's one form of psychotherapy but you practice psychotherapy... 

00:05:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Oh, yeah. 

00:05:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH As I do, too. 

00:05:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I do, too. And I, I have another view. 

00:06:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH You have another view. What's your other view? 

00:06:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well I, I tend to think that, uh, underlying, you know, the basic alienation, the separatness, the otherness, the fundamental ground of reality is, is one of connection. 

00:06:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:06:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That we're connected with everything and that for me liberation is, is really becoming more and more in touch with that dimension... 

00:06:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:06:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Of being part of everything, interconnected with everything. That way, as we move towards that we get, I suppose closer to what we might think of as our divine reality. 

00:06:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:06:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And ultimately the, you know, the highest model of liberation must, must be divinity itself. 

00:06:40
KATHLEEN R. SPEETH, Ph.D. Transpersonal Psychologist 

00:06:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH It must be. So the way you're talking now you sound like Freud talking about Aeros... 

00:06:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:06:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH As opposed to Thanatos, the idea of a life instinct, something that moves toward life- 

00:06:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:06:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And away from dying... 

00:06:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. 

00:06:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And away from entropy. 

00:06:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:06:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Something that makes form out of chaos. 

00:06:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:06:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And you feel that is development, and of course, so do I. 

00:07:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:07:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH So then what keeps us from that? What, what holds us back? What do we need to be liberated from so that we could make connections instead of break connections? And get hot rather than cool. 

00:07:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I, I would say it's our attachments. 

00:07:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. And what attachments? 

00:07:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It, it could be an attachment to a, a habit pattern that we have. 

00:07:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

00:07:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Or, or to a belief system. 

00:07:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:07:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE My sense is that the unattached mind just gravitates naturally to that state and, and when I'm with a group of people I, I can watch some of them go right there... 

00:07:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:07:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And you have the sense they're connected... 

00:07:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

00:07:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And they're with it and then somebody else, their mind just won't let him float to that level. 

00:07:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:07:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And they've gotta talk about, it could be anything, it could be their clothing, it could be artwork, it could...We have a million excuses- 

00:07:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:07:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That we use for, for not always resonating, I guess is a word I might use at that level of connectedness. 

00:07:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm, or living enthusiastically. 

00:07:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:07:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. And what do you think holds people back from that? You know, Wilhelm Reich would call it an anti-pleasure bias in the character. Where does that come from? 

00:08:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's a good question. 

00:08:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH I mean, we're talking about being liberated- 

00:08:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:08:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH From some kind of a net we throw around ourselves. 

00:08:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, Ph.D. 

00:08:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. Well, in many people it's clear to me it's trauma. They, they've been tramatized in one way or another and they're kind of stuck. They haven't worked through their trauma. 

00:08:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And how does a trauma stick people? Wh-, what really happens? I mean, let's talk about it as deeply as we can. What do we need to be liberated from? 

00:08:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Probably... I'm glad you're asking me all these questions. I't s a delight to be interviewed on my own show. 

00:08:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

00:08:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Probably Kathy, to me, I, I would say, you know the basic thing is self-hatred. 

00:08:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:08:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's, it's, places where we feel that we can't love ourselves. 

00:08:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:08:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE If we've been traumatized we, we incorporate that and we think, 'I deserved that.' 

00:08:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:08:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The universe is telling me I, I'm that kind of a person who should be punished. 

00:09:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. So what you're saying is that, you're saying two things, and in this way I believe we've got a lot of wisdom in the Western psychotherapeutic tradition. 

00:09:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:09:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH One thing you're saying, and I, I of course agree with you, is that it's something about going away from entropy and toward life. The second thing you're saying is that it has something to do with having been hurt. 

00:09:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:09:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right? We have to somehow work through some non-metabolized experiences, right? 

00:09:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:09:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH We need to liberate ourselves from something that has gripped us and grabbed us and is holding us back, something that happened very early and something that, the wish we have to dissolve to die hangs onto it. 

00:09:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And the irony is that something is us. 

00:09:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH That something is us. 

00:09:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's something we're doing to ourselves. 

00:09:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH It's something we're doing to ourselves. 

00:09:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:09:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH So one extraordinary thing about liberation it seems to me, is that the very things that hold us back are the things that hold us in our families, in the family structure. 

00:10:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Interesting. 

00:10:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:10:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:10:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH So for example, mother doesn't want you to sit and play on your own in your own way, she wants to have an interaction with you, so she can feel like a good mother. Ah, that's one example. I just worked with someone today for initial therapy session and for whom that was true. He didn't dare, when he was with his girlfriend be quiet and just look at the fire. He felt he had to keep entertaining his girlfriend. 

00:10:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:10:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And so he was ready to clear the decks of all girlfriends because he didn't allow himself to be himself while in the company of a person who reminded him of his mother. 

00:10:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:10:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH So he's not a free man. 

00:10:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. Right. 

00:10:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

00:10:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Because of some conditioning he had had with her. 

00:10:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yes. Right. 

00:10:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:10:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Or another example, somebody I worked with whose mother was a Holocaust survivor, who was a happy woman, this patient of mine, a happy woman and well-adjusted with four or five brothers and sisters who were'nt and a mother who was a widow and a Holocaust survivor. 

00:11:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:11:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And she couldn't give up her guilt, because it turned out her guilt was the only link she had with her mother. 

00:11:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. That's where they could communicate. 

00:11:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah, that's where they could, that's where they could... 

00:11:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Her mother felt guilty because she was a survivor... 

00:11:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. Mm-hmm. 

00:11:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And therefore in order to kind of enter into a resonance... 

00:11:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:11:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE ...with her mother- 

00:11:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:11:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE She had to be guilty, too. 

00:11:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH That's right. 

00:11:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And they could be guilty together and have a good time. 

00:11:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Exactly. 

00:11:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:11:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And they could be connected. 

00:11:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:11:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Even if they had a rotten time, they would be together. 

00:11:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The irony to me is, fr-, from my perspective, guilt is totally unnecessary. It serves no function whatsoever. 

00:11:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. Except the function of connecting one with a guilty subculture. 

00:11:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:11:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. So in order to be free, we have to be willing to be solitary, emotionally solitary. 

00:11:55
JAY HALEY Mm-hmm. Solitary. 

00:11:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

00:11:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE What does solitary mean? 

00:11:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH It means that we have to be, we have to dare to be objective and not to share in order to become a 'we' with other people, not to share their beliefs. 

00:12:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Oh, to be able to sort of remove ourselves from the herd instincts. 

00:12:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. Yeah. Perhaps to be really free, one can't be a healthy animal in a happy herd. 

00:12:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:12:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Or perhaps one can, but one has to take the chance to find out. 

00:12:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:12:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And that's a courageous step. 

00:12:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. You know, one of the things, uh, that you've delved into quite extensively and written about is "The Gurdjieff Work," and I recall a, a point that you made about Gurdjieff is, is that he claimed as, as opposed to Western psychotherapies, that all of the negative emotions, anger, hatred, and so on were unnecessary. 

00:12:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:12:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That it was possible to live a healthy, harmonious, happy life without any of those. 

00:12:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:12:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And yet our culture somehow, we have so much reinforcement that, that says, you know, you should be getting here. 

00:13:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:13:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You should be feeling guilty. You should be, uh, negative a certain amount of the day, otherwise you're not owning your emotions. 

00:13:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. And of course, that's what, what I think of is one of the mistakes that many therapists make. 

00:13:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:13:10
KATHLEEN R. SPEETH, Ph.D. Transpersonal Psychologist 

00:13:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH They render their patients unhappy. That is, they, people come out of therapy feeling entitled to a lot of negative emotions. 

00:13:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:13:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And the fact is that they have to come to consciousness to be worked through to be put aside. Because they're really not necessary. 

00:13:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's interesting. 

00:13:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:13:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And, and so for you part of the definition of liberation would be to be liberated from negative emotions. 

00:13:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH One could still have them but probably the perverse sustaining of them would be gone. 

00:13:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:13:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH I mean how could, given that as we sit here, um, there are probably bombers going overhead with nuclear warheads on them and so forth, we live in a very dangerous world, an explosive world, it would be difficult to simply accept that without amount of s-, what you might call negativity. 

00:14:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:14:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH But not to dwell on that. 

00:14:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. But when one looks at, at warfare in the world and, and certain people such as the Middle East, where' they're just at each other... 

00:14:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

00:14:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE At each other, at each other. 

00:14:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:14:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And they've been for thousands of years and one would think the only hope for peace in these situations is, is to somehow be able to communicate to these people to, to let go, to calm down and not to be so negative about it. 

00:14:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. And of course on a...psychotherapy deals with an individual person rather than a whole political scene and within an individual that same thing is true. There are many eyes, there are many sub-personalities. 

00:14:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We're often at war with ourselves. 

00:14:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. Right. And that war has to be, um, ended. 

00:14:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. Well, you know, the, uh, the Muslims have a term, the Holy War. 

00:14:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:15:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And it often does refer to an internal war between the personality and the spirit and various parts of ourselves. It's treated as something that we have to engage in. We can't avoid these things. And the psychologists say the same thing and you can't just ignore your, your anger. 

00:15:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH No, that's certainly not an invitation to repression or suppression at all to think that it might be possible to live in a very deeply content way without that. Right. 

00:15:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. What you're saying is that if one were to see the light at the end of the tunnel... 

00:15:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

00:15:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Work through the anger, then there would be a time in one's life when, when one should have achieved a state you could calll liberated... 

00:15:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:15:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Or enlightened where, where it would be possible to let go of that. 

00:15:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. Negative emotions are a little analogous to other substances that are misused like cocaine and marijuana and alcohol. It's, it's an addiction to feel negative and the holy war inside, one meaning of it might be to feel no need to have the rush that the negative emotion produces, the rush I'm entitled, the feeling of being vindicated, etc. So that would be one movement toward liberation. 

00:16:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE My sense is that part of the, the dynamics here occurs when we become polarized to such an extent that we think that, uh, good and evil at odds with themselves inside of us and that one must totally vanquish the other... 

00:16:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:16:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE There, there is no vanquishing of, of that kind. 

00:16:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:16:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE They really have to come together, and one discovers usually that evil isn't really evil. 

00:16:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. So there is that feeling of wanting to be a whole person, a dapple person, a 3D person, not a split person into, into black and white. That's part of moving toward liberation, to be free of the sense of being split inside into a part of me that I, I love and a part of me that I despise. 

00:17:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:17:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH So that's another aspect of what, what's necessary to do. 

00:17:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay. 

00:17:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And another thing you were saying seems to me very important, is that we need to be free of the necessity to take and defend one position. 

00:17:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:17:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right? So, why should I write see everything from a narcissistic point of view? Why couldn't I be objective and see myself as the same as other people? That would be a big liberation. 

00:17:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:17:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH If I didn't polarize myself and aggrandize this little one that I am. 

00:17:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well I, you know, I recall a modern writer who has a very popular book out right now the name of it I forget, 'The Dulling of the American Mind' I think or something to that effect. 

00:17:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:17:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And his point is that we-, it's too bad that we aren't teaching people more about good and evil. We're forgetting what he calls traditional basic values. 

00:17:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:17:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE People are becoming too relativistic. 

00:17:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:18:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We should be attacking evil more. And you seem to be saying, and I would agree, that no, it's just the opposite. We should be transcending this good and evil polarity. 

00:18:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. And of course that is goodness, so that it freedom. 

00:18:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:18:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And the idea, the Sufis have have a nice way of saying it. They say let go of your preconceptions and accept your destiny. Right? What is the reason to be liberated? What are we being liberated from? We're being liberated basically from conditioning that we received in early childhood and also from anti-life aspects of probably our biology. I suppose that's in the DNA. I don't know. 

00:18:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:18:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right, but for what reason? It seems to me, so than we can live out some kind of personal destiny. 

00:18:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:18:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And how will we ever know about that if we're going through the motions in order to continue some family tradition or some cultural tradition. 

00:18:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. You mentioned earlier that, that Freud had described these two forces. 

00:19:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:19:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Eros, the force of life and Thenatos, the force of death and we both agreed we're very sympathetic to the Eros force. 

00:19:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:19:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But what about Thanatos? What a, how does liberation, uh, become a factor in our lives as we face death? 

00:19:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH It must be a very important question for many people now, because at this time in history, the gay community is being terribly terribly ravaged by AIDS. 

00:19:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:19:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And I have a friend who is gay and who's a therapist and he said he knows 40 people, patients and friends who've died in the last year he's had to face with them death, and, uh, it's a very good teacher, right? So it certainly does help a person get their priorities straight, to... What could be more, uh, cleansing of stupidities than to face one's death? But as you and I sit here, how different are we from those people who have been given a diagnosis of AIDS? I mean, right now we are also finite. 

00:20:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right. We also have to die. 

00:20:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH We do. I mean, we are Ivan Illich. 

00:20:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. But I'm not looking forward to my death just yet. 

00:20:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. Well, why look forward to it at all? The question is to use it to give definition to your values right now. 

00:20:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:20:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH I mean, does it help you at all to think that you're mortal? 

00:20:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It does. 

00:20:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

00:20:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It does. In, in, in my own work I pay a lot of attention to issues of, of life and death. 

00:20:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

00:20:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Often in hypnosis I take people beyond the realm of death to explore, to get in touch with some sense of eternity. 

00:20:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

00:20:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Which I think is with us all the time. 

00:20:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:20:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And I, you know, it seems to me that it's possible that when peoople live from, from a place within them that echoes of eternity that death isn't so much of an issue, really. 

00:21:05
KATHLEEN R. SPEETH, Ph.D. Transpersonal Psychologist 

00:21:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH So a free man or woman would be impeccable, would be courageous, would be able to face his own finitude or his own eternity. 

00:21:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know, it reminds me of a Zen story of, of a time when there was much warfare in Japan and the monastery was ransacked. A general came in and he saw the, uh, Zen monk praying and he came up to him with his sword and he says, "Don't you know?" He said, "I'm a man who can run you through with this sword without blinking an eye. 

00:21:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:21:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The monk looked up at him and said, "Don't you know I'm a man who can be run through without blinking an eye." 

00:21:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. That's a free man. 

00:21:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The general put his sword down. Yeah. 

00:21:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. That is a free man. So when we talk about liberation we're talking about liberation from the perspective of ego, my own personal ego. 

00:22:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:22:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH So that I can see from all points of view and that is divinity. What is divinity? 

00:22:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So it's the ego that separates us from that. 

00:22:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH It's a kind of a paranoid clot of attention inside, a trembling paranoid clot inside, don't you feel? Trumpa Rinpoche called it the basic contraction of ego. 

00:22:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The basic contradiction of ego. 

00:22:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

00:22:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I like it. It, and I suppose that's also what's responsible for selfishness and greed... 

00:22:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

00:22:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE ...and clinging of every sort. 

00:22:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. Right. And of course one, one is, to the degree that one is getting free of that, then it's possible to have empathy with others. If I'm not in a fortress protecting myself maybe I can have a sense of how you're living and what your situation is. 

00:22:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. I should think there must be a difference though between this kind of egotistical or egoistical clinging in a sense of when a person is real mission, when they're following their destiny, when, when they're attached to something but it's something greater than themselves, a life purpose, creative work of some sort. 

00:23:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. Right. A heroic life. 

00:23:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:23:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH A life like Theseus, who was able to go to through the labyrinth and kill the minotaur, or life like, um, the life of Einstein, who was able to lock himself in a room for two weeks and come out with E=MC2 and soforth. 

00:23:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:23:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH That's a hero's life. 

00:23:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, Ph.D. 

00:23:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE How, now how does this relate to, uh, the dynamics of liberation? How, how do we free ourselves from the, the petty clinging... 

00:23:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:23:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And enter into the heroic life? 

00:23:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. How do we, how do we work through enough so that our actions come not from deficiency and not from fear and not from conditioning, but from, uh, what Longchenpa called lucid awareness consumate perspicacity. 

00:23:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's a mouthful. Consumate pers-, purpousfacacity. 

00:23:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. The, the sense of doing just the right thing at the right time. 

00:24:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:24:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right? How do, how do we get there? I think as Westerners we can on the psychotherapeutic path. 

00:24:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:24:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH You know, there is a person named Jack Engler who is a psychiatrist in Boston, and he did a study in Burma in which he, uh, I, I don't know if he did the study or who took the data but the results were that Westerners and Burmese sat with, um, with a teacher, a Theravadan... 

00:24:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Buddhist. 

00:24:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Buddhist teacher. 

00:24:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:24:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And after six weeks, the, the Burmese had the first level of enlightenment and the Westerners had developed a transference neurosh-, neurosis on the teacher. Right. So for us, we're different from the people for whom those meditative traditions were... 

00:24:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE A transference neurosis... 

00:24:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

00:24:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE ...is, is where they're projecting their own emotions about their parents probably... 

00:24:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

00:24:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE ...onto the teacher. 

00:24:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:24:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And they're working that out. 

00:25:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. And they're acting toward the teacher as if he were a loved, feared or whatever, parent. 

00:25:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:25:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. So for us, we could do the two-person meditation called psychoanalysis, in which the therapist sits with evenly hovering awareness and the patient sits or lies with, with the free association of thought. What could be more likely to produce self-awareness than that kind of working through? 

00:25:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I do-, you know, I don't know because I, I love to do therapeutic work with people myself, but I haven't necessarily heard of great geniuses, real heroes coming out that way. I mean, did Einstein need a therapist? 

00:25:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH No, and I have to say that he refused psychoanalysis. He was afraid that it would interfere with his gift. 

00:25:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. This is not to demean therapy. 

00:25:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH No, but I, I hear what you're saying and I can only say that in my experience, the people that I know also my own self, have profited by understanding their minds in the therapeutic manner and that just means to do, conduct your own analysis of your life with the companionship of a, of a therapist. 

00:26:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE My sense is that maybe therapy does get one through certain stages but there are certainly stages on the heroic journey that go beyond... 

00:26:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:26:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE What Western psychology has,, is equipped to deal with. 

00:26:30
KATHLEEN R. SPEETH, Ph.D. Transpersonal Psychologist 

00:26:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH When in fact a hero wants to face his destiny without a cane. So at some point he'll have to stand alone and make it and meet whatever's coming toward him. 

00:26:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. Well, and I guess ultimately that's everybody's destiny. 

00:26:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH I guess it is. 

00:26:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ultimately. Well, Kathleen Spleeth, it's been a pleasure sharing this half-hour with you. I think this is for me personally, I'd like to say, one of the exciting interviews I've, I've ever done. 

00:27:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH I'm very glad to be here. 

00:27:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And I hope to have you back again... 

00:27:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Okay. 

00:27:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE ...as well. Thank you so much for being with me. 

00:27:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Thank you, Jeff. 

00:27:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And thank you very much for being with us.

with Jeffrey Mishlove 

00:27:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome. I'm Jeffrey Mishlove. Our topic today is the enemy within. It reminds me of Pogo's famous statement, "We have met the enemy and he is us." With me in the studio is Dr. Kathleen Speeth, the co-editor with Dr. Daniel Goldman of "The Essential Psychotherapies" and author of "The Gurdjieff Work" and "Gurdjieff Seeker After Truth." Welcome, Kathy. 

00:28:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Thank you, Jeff. 

00:28:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's a pleasure to be with you again. 

00:28:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH I'm glad to be here. 

00:28:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know, the issue of the inner enemy, the enemy within really relates, I suppose, to the many ways in which we sabotage ourselves and I suppose really, when we look closely at the issue of self sabotage it, it may be virtually moment-by-moment, not just, you know, a few key incidents in my whole lifetime where I could've done better, but maybe on a daily or hourly or minute-by-minute basis we do things to prevent ourselves from really being present, really being aware and awake and alive to, to the possibilities of our own lives. 

00:28:55
KATHLEEN R. SPEETH, PHD TRANSPERSONAL PSYCHOLOGIST 

00:28:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. We're neither safe nor awake. It seems that when a person gets to the point where they're neurotic, which is quite a bit of development for a human being, then they have the problem of being divided against themselves. Right? Each person who is up to the point of neurosis, which I think is kind of a triumph, uh, begins to have the capacity for guilt and begins to feel like they're on trial, interior trial. 

00:29:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:29:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH So that one's sense of worthwhileness is always in question. Did I do that right? Did I do that right? And soforth. And I think that weakens us. Certainly it's one of the causes of accident-proneness. 

00:29:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. I mean, so long as we're divided then we're unable to really ever feel good about anything that we do. 

00:29:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Or if we are able to feel good about anything we call it a peak experience. 

00:29:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. It seems so rare. 

00:29:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

00:29:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And I guess a-, hand-in-hand with that is this common fear which is often described, the fear of success. 

00:29:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

00:29:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know, if I ever really did what I know I can do... 

00:29:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:29:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE How would I be able to handle that? How could I live with the guilt of being successful? 

00:30:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Exactly, and there's this thing called 'the imposter syndrome.' 

00:30:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:30:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. If somebody does happen to achieve success or a big promotion, then they feel, 'Oh my God, I' going to be found out.' There is an inner undermining and a sense of fraudulence about achievement. 

00:30:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. You know, I can say personally I felt that way for many years myself, when I first worked on the radio and interviewed leading figures in psychology and spirituality. I often felt that if it wasn't for the fact that I was on the radio I would have no business, uh, discussing these ideas or talking with these people that, uh, you know, there was some part of me that didn't really live up to the very work that I was doing. 

00:30:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

00:30:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It took me many, many years to, to change my attitude about that. 

00:30:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Is it changed now? 

00:30:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I think it is. Yeah. 

00:30:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:30:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. Uh-huh. 

00:30:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH You know, once I had a patient who was a physician and he told me of an experience that I recognized, and you probably will, too. He said walking down the, uh, corridor of the hospital he would hear them calling, 'Doctor so-and-so! Doctor so-and-so! Call for Doctor so-and-so!' Anhd he would think, "Do these people think I'm a doctor? Do they really think I am the person that they're calling? I'm wearing a white coat but I know I'm just a child." So there was a sense of the imposter nature of his being a physician. 

00:31:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You, you know, you sort of hinted earlier that something like this could be quite healthy. I mean we have, we work quite a bit to, to arrive at this sense of, of neurosis, this sense of feeling divided about ourselves. There seems to be something profound in all of that. After all, is he really 'Doctor' or is his identity something deeper, something other than that? 

00:31:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. Of course, it seems to me that if a person doesn't have the capacity for guilt, they're in big trouble and, uh, at the same time they may have more of a chance of being happy. It's kind of paradoxical. 

00:31:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:32:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh, have you ever known anyone who didn't have the capacity for guilt? 

00:32:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I, I have as a matter of fact and they were some of the most disastrous, uh, encounters in, in my life. 

00:32:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

00:32:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE These people are, tend to be criminal and, or sociopathic or psychopathic. 

00:32:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. There's a, a whole level of development that's more disturbed, I think then neurosis, and it's the narcissistic disorders and the borderline disorders. But borderlines have a better chance. People who are more disorganized than neurotics but less than psychotics, called borderlines, can develop. But one very, very difficult type of person to work with, and I think we can find this in ourselves also, some little corner of ourselves, is the narcissistic person. 

00:32:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:32:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH The person who is incapable of empathy. 

00:32:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In fact, one might say that, uh, the narcissistic, uh, personality trait is just a little corner of ourselves. I recall reading Erich Fromm, who suggested that this is at our very core. It, in fact, it's part of our, our survival mechanism that, that we can act, uh, in strictly self-interested ways. 

00:33:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. Of course, that's true and everyone has to bottomline preserve their own life, but somehow it makes me proud to be a human being, is that at some point altruism also exists. 

00:33:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:33:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH The capacity to put oneself into the other person's shoes, the capacity for empathy is a, is, uh, something that makes us different from an-, other animals, it seems to me. 

00:33:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. Well, we're getting now what I think might be a fine distinction that we ought to explore a little further, which is the difference self-sacrifice and altruism and self-sabotage. 

00:33:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. Exactly. And the inner sense is quite different, but the exterior sense, the exterior picture may look similar. For example, take the, the classic situation of a woman, a martyred woman, a housewife whose husband has a lot of status and whose children are doing well at Ivy League universities and she just stays at home baking brownies and saying, 'Leave me here. It's okay. I'll sit in the dark by myself.' 

00:34:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:34:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Is she being altruistic or is she being masochistic? 

00:34:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Or a martyr. Yeah. Uh-huh. 

00:34:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. Right. 

00:34:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, it sounds masochistic. 

00:34:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH It does. I, I biased it towards masochism. 

00:34:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah, but I'm sure, uh, such a woman, and I've had relatives like this, would have many people who would say, 'Oh, she is such a saint.' 

00:34:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. Would they? 

00:34:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Reminds me of an aunt of mine who was constantly devoting herself to other people and feeling miserable the whole time but people... I think it's, it's, you know, how alcoholics have relatives who act as "co's," people who cooperate with them. 

00:34:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. Right. 

00:34:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, masochists do this also. 

00:34:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:34:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Because people around them benefit, I suppose, in sadistic ways. So calling somebody else a saint because they sabotage themselves to the, to the benefit of other people may be a way of feeding into their own masochism. 

00:35:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:35:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It may be quite sadistic. 

00:35:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Of course, it may be. And so we have here this very important thing to discover which is how can we be a noble human being and not a masochist? 

00:35:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:35:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh, for example, I think most people have seen the movie on Mother Theresa. You saw it. 

00:35:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE No. 

00:35:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH You didn't see it? 

00:35:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE No, I didn't. 

00:35:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Well, here's this woman in India who was really devoting her life to washing the feet of lepers and picking little discarded infants out of garbage cans and giving them vitamins and, uh, she gives her whole life to humanity and she's not masochistic. It's very obvious that she's not masochistic. 

00:35:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:35:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh, something else is going on. She's a person who seems to have any intention and that intention is used for what we might consider good. She doesn't seem to be divided against herself as so many people are who are, uh, living an ordinary life. 

00:35:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:36:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH The only people who don't seem to be divided are the psychopaths, these narcissistic characters. 

00:36:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Psychopaths and saints. 

00:36:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. Psychopaths and saints. Right. 

00:36:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. Well, there's certainly a, a vast difference between the two. 

00:36:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Vast. 

00:36:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And how do you account for that? 

00:36:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Well, if, if... Well, let's think about it. 

00:36:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:36:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Um, it seems to me that a neurotic is closer to saint than a psychopath, and I'll tell you why I think so and then I'll take the other point view. It seems to me that, for example, I have a patient and the patient spent a lot of time in the Cal library looking over the microfiche copies of old newspapers from towns in the central valley because she had been on a, a freeway and she had felt a little bump on the side of her car, she began to feel that she had hit somebody and had driven away. So she, she developed a, a lifestyle in which you spend a lot of time the library just trying to find what she could have done and going to this paper and that paper and this paper. Now, that person has a conscience. 

00:37:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:37:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH But conscience has taken her over and stolen her life from her. 

00:37:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It sounds like an obsession. 

00:37:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH It sounds like an obsession and it is an obsession, and she has an obsessive character style. But imagine if a person drove down that freeway, felt the bump and never felt another thing about it. 

00:37:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:37:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH What would you think of that person? 

00:37:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I don't know. I mean, I feel bumps in my car all the time. 

00:37:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. Well, what if there was a, some possibility that, that... 

00:37:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You mean a thud. 

00:37:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. I mean a thud. Okay. 

00:37:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. Well it, it would, would seem morbid for a person to drive down the car and feel a thud... 

00:37:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

00:37:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And, and then just ignore it. 

00:37:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

00:37:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It would seem morbid. It would seem criminal. It would seem heinous. 

00:38:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. Right. So there we have the other... So we see that the person who is very neurotic, who is tearing her hair out obsessively over a kind of scrupulousness that doesn't make any sense, in some sense has good in them. 

00:38:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:38:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Where as a person who just doesn't care and drives away is somebody we would reject as a friend or we would, we would feel that was repugnant. 

00:38:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. In other words, even this obsessive neurosis is in some sense in the service of life. 

00:38:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

00:38:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Where as there is another type of, of character in which what they do is with callous disregard to life itself. 

00:38:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. Right. 

00:38:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And I suppose when we talk about the inner enemy it's that part of ourselves that, that must be the most dangerous. 

00:38:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. And those people don't have any ability to, to feel what it might be like to be another person that they interact with. So these are the conmen of society. But on the other hand, if we want to look at it, turn it all around maybe those people are closer to saints in another way, because they aren't divided. They are not inner-, inwardly divided and they are not undermined. 

00:39:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. There are some classic cases in, in the, in literature of sainthood of criminals who, who were suddenly converted from the life of, of murdery, of murder and thievery. 

00:39:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:39:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE To, uh, to, to sainthood. 

00:39:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. Milarepa was such a person. 

00:39:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:39:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Do you remember the story of Milarepa? He had killed somebody and he'd caused hailstones to, to fall and all kinds of weather disturbances with his sorcery and then he had a conversion experience and became a, an Orthodox Tibetan Buddhist and a saint. 

00:39:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:39:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH So I think of Milarepa. 

00:39:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:39:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH But what is it? There's this tremendous criminal intensity. You know, I'd been interested in attention for all my life, really. 

00:39:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:39:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And one time I happened to be driving through Reno, Nevada and saw those people who play blackjack and what I noticed is how extremely intelligently, acutely aware those people were, the croupiers, the dealers. 

00:40:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE They're very sharp. 

00:40:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Very sharp. 

00:40:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Within their sphere. 

00:40:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Very good. 

00:40:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:40:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH A nd we all know that, uh, when we're frightened or when we're very greedy we're one-pointed. 

00:40:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:40:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH So it seems like the way to be one-pointed, one of the ways to be, is to be, um, psychopathic. 

00:40:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:40:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Not to have the capacity for guilt. 

00:40:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:40:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And I think in that way we, kind of, ordinary, neurotic people are at a terrible disadvantage when we interact with criminals. 

00:40:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We're paralyzed. 

00:40:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH We're paralyzed. 

00:40:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:40:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And we're, uh, ingenuous. 

00:40:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. Uh, what do you mean ingenuous? 

00:40:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH I mean that we expect other people through projection to treat us the way we would treat them. 

00:40:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:40:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Like the little old lady in the story who's sold a burial plot underwater. That kind of thing. 

00:40:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:40:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Just couldn't imagine anyone would come to the door and do that to her. 

00:41:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. Well, this is an issue, in fact it's a large-scale social issue because we have people...the Hitlers, the Noriegas of, of the world. I mean, we could list them again and again and again, people who were clearly psychopathic, who rise to positions of enormous power because in their certainty... 

00:41:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:41:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE About things in their one-pointedness, in their focus, they can attract enormous followings. 

00:41:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:41:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And enormous admiration. 

00:41:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. Certainty is terribly attractive. All of us wants... All of us who, who are confused by the complexity of life and the nuances and subtleties of life are looking for certainty. 

00:41:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:41:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH We're looking for someone who will say, "I know," not, "I'm pretty sure it's this way," not to hedge but to say, "I know." 

00:41:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. I think it's one of the great traps of, of leadership and you could certainly see it I, I think in the Reagan period. Reagan is certainly far less maliciously than, than many other rulers but he always took that posture that he was certain. 

00:42:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:42:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Whether or not he was. I think i-, it's become in American politics almost catastrophic to ever admit uncertainty. 

00:42:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. You know, something about power and the inner enemy and the exterior enemy that seems to me to go together. 

00:42:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:42:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Um, a person who is interested, who is able to step into the shoes of another cannot take power over them. It's only a person without the capacity for empathy that can truly be tyrannical and control another person, don't you think? 

00:42:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I, I don't know. That's very interesting because isn't our fear just the opposite? Isn't our fear that if we let people too close to us, if we let them empathize or let them under our skin, then they will have that control. Then they will be able to manipulate. 

00:42:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. Well has that been true for you? 

00:42:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE No, I can't say that it has been but, you know, I can speak for myself and I, I think that is my fear at times. 

00:43:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. Well it, it occurs to me right now that this part of our mind that undermines us is psychopathic itself. 

00:43:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:43:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH That it has no way, no possibility of letting us go and it's never going to stop attacking us. So what I see is that in myself for example, if I don't do a good job something I have to really work to turn voice off in me, or to not listen it. And if I go close to it, the arguments that I have against it are not gonna win. That is, it's out for power and I'm out for truth. 

00:43:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. Well, Freud described the death instinct, Thanatos... 

00:43:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:43:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And he, he suggested, you know, that as we look at the very early evolution of life on this planet, at some point biological material, living tissues and cells emerged out, out of mineral forms and he seemed to feel that still from the mineral world calling to us was, was this entropy, this sense that we have to return back to total death and... 

00:44:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:44:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And that drives us and he felt, I think, towards the end of his life that this is one of the deepest and most powerful of instincts. 

00:44:15
KATHLEEN R. SPEETH, PhD Transpersonal Psychologist 

00:44:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right, and people after Floyd rejected that except for Melanie Klein. It was basically rejected and yet it seems to me to be so clear in the people I work with and in myself, that there's a tendency that's as strong as gravity and kind of an entropic tendency to go toward chaos and away from truth and light and that we have to watch out for that at every moment and be vigilant. 

00:44:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, you have to ask yourself why is it after 5000 years of civilization we're still making war. 

00:44:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

00:44:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE What is it that draws us to, to be rubberneckers on the freeway that...or why is it that our newspapers always focus on violence. 

00:45:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right, and why is it that our television, if you just turn the channel once around you'll say how much violence there is. That's what people want to see. What is this necrophilious aspect in us? 

00:45:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PhD 

00:45:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, football s another example. I mean, how many football players get maimed every year? 

00:45:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH I know, and ice hockey is even more of an example. 

00:45:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:45:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH People seem to want to watch death and destruction and decay. They're fasc-, there's something that's fascinated by that. 

00:45:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:45:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Interiorly, I think that's also true and I think that the part that attacks us and makes us feel weak and sabotages us is the part that likes to see accidents. 

00:45:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's as if there's something diabolical in there that will gloat when we feel pain, when we really suffer. 

00:45:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH As if... Mm-hmm. 

00:45:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE When we really undermine ourselves. 

00:45:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH As if there's something diabolical, as if there's something sadistic. 

00:45:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah, yeah. 

00:45:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Don't you see that in people you work with. 

00:45:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I see it in myself at times. 

00:45:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And I see it in myself, too. 

00:46:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:46:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right, I'm just trying to... 

00:46:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That is frightening. 

00:46:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. Well, what can we do? This seems to be a school for vigilance. 

00:46:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:46:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And apparently, at least according to some thinkers like Gurdjieff, this negative part or this destructive part is necessary. How...evolution seems to need predators. Remember the dodo? 

00:46:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:46:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH The dodo would sit on a branch and the, the explorers would come up with a musket and put it right in it's beak and, uh, the dodo would just drop dead because the dodo had never been acquainted with a predator, never been acquainted with say denying force or destruction. 

00:46:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So, you're suggesting that what we call a diabolic force, and perhaps even labeled evil in a religious sense... 

00:46:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

00:46:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE ...within us is, is really a natural part of our biology. 

00:46:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yes and that, and just because it's natural and part of our biology probably part of our instinctive inheritance, uh, doesn't mean that it's something that needs to be expressed. Uh, there was a tendency in psychology after, after Freud to think that the Marquis de Sade, for example, was just expressing what a human being should be able to express. 

00:47:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:47:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH But the need to torture someone and, and delight in their suffering is not a human need that needs to be expressed, it seems me. It needs to be worked through and that energy is to be used for something positive. 

00:47:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I think we have to aknowledge that this is, even if it's a minority of people who engage in this kind of behavior, it's part of us. It's part of our culture and, and there are... I mean, how many people are buying this, this 'Faces of Death' video and who are the people who are making these films? 

00:47:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. It's part of us and what does that mean? I mean what, what are we faced with then? I have this part in me. What do I do with it? How do I cope with it? How do I make sure it doesn't, uh, control my mouth or my hand so that I harm somebody? 

00:48:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:48:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Or myself? Or control my thoughts? 

00:48:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's a real issue. 

00:48:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. You know, Edmund Bergler said something very interesting about it, I think. He said that, um, that this part tends to happen when we wake up-, tends to catch us unawares when wake up in the morning. 

00:48:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:48:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH That for some reason it's right there in the darkest hours of the night and the first moments of the morning and I have found with many people I work with that they can learn to control this and keep away from it during the day, but in their dreams or the first moments of morning, uh, it's there still. 

00:48:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. It's interesting. In dreams, I, I certainly have had dreams in which I've murdered... 

00:48:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

00:48:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And felt guilty... 

00:48:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

00:48:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE ...about having done it, or known that I had done it even if I didn't do it in the dream. Uh, but that seems almost like a, you know, a, a healthy outlet for that part of ourselves. The greatest atrocities were often committed in the name of goodness. 

00:49:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Absolutely. 

00:49:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The inquisition, for example. It's, it's when we think that evil is only outside of ourselves that we're really in trouble. 

00:49:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. In fact, that's the most irresponsible thing we could possibly think. 

00:49:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:49:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH It seems the important thing is to understand that this torture is inside, that if we're not aware it will come after us and we need to know all kinds of ways to, to control it and triumph over it. 

00:49:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, it seems though, when you use terms like control.. 

00:49:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

00:49:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE ...and triumph over, you're almost setting yourself up. I mean, how can you really control or triumph over this and, and really be try-, isn't there a need to be accepting at some level? Isn't there a need to integrate? 

00:49:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Certainly, but let's just take an example so that we don't just talk about... 

00:49:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:50:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH ...in generalities. How about the woman in my practice who controls her boyfriend with screaming and crying and needing to know where he is all the time. He has to call her four times a day. Uh, he has to... She has to know where he is at all times and she does this in the name of what she calls honesty or genuineness. 

00:50:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:50:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Now it seems to me that that woman, and it seems to her, too, needs to learn to be absorbed with her own work. She has a lot of artistic talent, and she needs to center herself on herself and she needs to, I'll use the word, triumph over her need to track her boyfriend's movements and control him moment after moment, at a distance or clos up. 

00:50:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:50:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Do you think so? 

00:50:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I, I think I would want to couch it a little differently. 

00:50:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-uh. 

00:50:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I think when you ask a person to triumph over themselves there, there's something about that that makes it seem like one other part of you has to lose. 

00:50:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

00:51:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And it seems to me that her behavior needs to change. 

00:51:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

00:51:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But that maybe there are other ways that I would couch it. For example, to take that need and sublimate it, perhaps. 

00:51:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. Uh-huh. 

00:51:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE To, to acknowledge that that's a very real and genuine and important part of her and, and for her maybe to even learn how to feel tenderness toward that part of herself, mercy, acceptance of that part of herself and then direct that same energy just a little bit differently, like you would a young child. 

00:51:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. Well, I certainly think that you and I doing therapy with that woman would come out with the same result. 

00:51:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:51:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH She would end up not ruining the relationship she has because she would have her attention on something she's truly deeply interested in, and without effort she wouldn't have to follow her boyfriend's movements. 

00:51:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:51:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And be worried that he might sit at a lunch counter next to some other woman while he's eating his hotdog or whatever. I think we'd come out with the same result. But when it comes to, uh, the attitude we're taking toward the destructive element, perhaps we are a little different. 

00:52:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:52:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Because it seems to me that it isn't a beautiful part of her. It's, um, a very dangerous part of her that's likely to steal from the relationship with the man that she loves. 

00:52:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:52:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH In other words, it is her inner enemy. 

00:52:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:52:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Not a wonderful part of her that needs to be sublimated, but almost a beast that needs to be caged and somehow if I could, I don't know, this isn't the right metaphor but somehow we need to use the energy for something else, but to recognize it as a beast. 

00:52:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I think that there's something quite realistic about that. After all, we are animals. 

00:52:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:52:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We are mammals. We are, we have a beastial... 

00:52:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:52:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE ...nature. Uh, I just wonder though, if, we're unforgiving towards that part of ourselves, if, if... Well there's the phrase from the Bible... 

00:52:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:53:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Jesus said, "Resist not evil." It's in the resisting of the evil that we give it strength. 

00:53:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. But he also said, "Father forgive them." He himself wouldn't forgive them. 

00:53:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Oh, that's interesting. 

00:53:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH He wouldn't pardon. It's a very different attitude to decide not to pardon this part. 

00:53:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:53:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH That doesn't mean that, uh, one has to kill it. It can't be killed, but not to pardon it. It, it's quite a different and more pristine feeling to realize that this is true destruction. I'll give you another example of what I consider to be one of the most horrible things about the New Age thinking. 

00:53:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:53:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And that is a patient of mine came to me a few years ago and I had been away for a while and hadn't see her, and she came in and sat down and I said, "What is wrong with you?" She looked gray and the tears started to flow immediately me and she said, "I've had a breast removed and nobody knows it." My husband doesn't know it, believe it or not. 

00:54:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:54:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Her husband's an alcoholic. 

00:54:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That explains it then. 

00:54:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. Her friends didn't know it. And I said, "You mean you've had nobody?" She said, "I've gone through surgery and chemotherapy and not nobody, not my children, not my friends, not my lover and not my husband." 

00:54:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:54:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH No, actually the lover did know. Uh, in any case why was this? Because she felt so guilty for having had cancer and she knew that the people around her would say, "What have you done to yourself? What have you been thinking?" 

00:54:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE How did you create this cancer? 

00:54:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH How did you create this cancer? 

00:54:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:54:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH She said, "It was enough to have my breast removed, it was enough to throw up with chemotherapy without people telling me, 'what did you do to cause this?' 

00:54:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:54:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right? So, there's that inner enemy can even in in, in the form of New Age transcendent ideas. 

00:54:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, surely the, as they say, the greatest trick of the devil is, is to insinuate himself into every kind of circumstance and the convince us that he doesn't exist. 

00:55:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH That's right. The devil is a subtle theologian is the idea. 

00:55:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:55:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. So I would like to say that I think one does need to have a kind of holy war, not to accept it, not to forgive it, but to, to cage it, use it, treat it gingerly, know it, be vigilant with it and never to forgive it and never pardon it. 

00:55:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Definitely not a New Age viewpoint. 

00:55:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh, but a religious viewpoint. 

00:55:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. Well, there's a long-standing tradition of it and I guess what we're really getting into, and we should address the problem of evil itself. 

00:55:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

00:55:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I mean you're, you're treating this aspect of us as being genuinely evil and, and theologians have debated for thousands of years and will continue to debate whether there is such a thing as a force of evil or whether it's simply the absence of light... 

00:56:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:56:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The absence of knowledge. 

00:56:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. But I do think we have to go into it and I think exterior criminology and interior criminology are similar in this regard. 

00:56:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:56:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH There are two points of view, basically or we could polarize it maybe. There are many, many points of view. 

00:56:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I'm sure there are. 

00:56:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH But you're the criminologist. The two points I'm thinking of and you could, maybe you'd inform me, are the i-, the point of view which is we can rehabilitate these people. 

00:56:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:56:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH All of them. The is only because they had a bad childhood and soforth, and then the point of view that some people are not redeemable. 

00:56:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:56:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Well, you studied criminology. 

00:56:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well unfortunately, studying criminology is not going to provide us with, with many answers. 

00:56:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

00:56:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We, we know in our own penal system for example, that people often come out of prison worse than when they went in. 

00:56:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

00:57:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE People learn how, how to become criminals because of our penal system in some ways. So if, if one looks at the way in which society is structured, one, one almost has a sense that, that we are deliberately cultivating or structuring society to maintain a, a certain level crime. 

00:57:15
KATHLEEN R. SPEETH, PhD Transpersonal Psychologist 

00:57:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH I think that's a very important point because it seems to me that we the public or we the viewers are the ones that, uh, that collaborate with this. 

00:57:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:57:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH I mean, if in a society where people want to watch violence and murder and want to read about it in their newspapers, is it any wonder that people engage in it? 

00:57:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I suppose the classic example, which is coming to the forefront right now is how own American government on the one hand rails and rails and rails against illegal drug use and then on the other hand you can see how the government covertly, uh, is supporting misuse or at least ignoring it when it's politically convenient to do so. 

00:58:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right, and lying doing everything that they say that other people shouldn't do. 

00:58:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I mean, that seems to be a striking glimpse at human nature when, when we can look at that. 

00:58:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:58:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And I suppose there's nobody who can't at some level say that's a mirror of myself. 

00:58:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. You know we are, we interiorly have to be when the society is exteriorly. So what we see there is ourselves projected and of course many, many people who are convicted of felonies and terrible crimes are rehabilitatable. But there's that one element that may not be... 

00:58:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:58:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH ..that perhaps isn't. I saw an interesting thing on television you may have seen. It was a program on the Hillside strangler. 

00:58:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:58:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH In which one could see very clearly that this man was, um, making theater. He was pretending to be multiple personality. 

00:58:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:58:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And finally...Did you see that? 

00:58:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

00:58:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And finally a man came in from the University of Pennsylvania, Martin Orin (ph) and unmasked this whole thing. 

00:58:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

00:58:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And the man had no remorse. He had tortured, raped and murdered 14 women in cold blood with his cousin. 

00:59:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, there's something about the psychopathic personality that can be extremely charming. It's so easy to be taken in by these people. 

00:59:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH That's right. 

00:59:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's so easy to emphasize, uh, empathize with them. I mean, we, we neurotics normally are willing to open our hearts to a person with a good story. 

00:59:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

00:59:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And psychopaths have great stories. They're marvelous storytellers. 

00:59:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. And they aren't playing by the same rules. 

00:59:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:59:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. So it's a very dangerous thing to project,uh, rehabilitated, uh, the ability to be rehabilitated onto a psychopathy. 

00:59:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I, I think if we look at the profession of psychiatry and psychology it's, it's fairly well accepted at this point that, uh, psychopathic or sociopathic behavior is simply not amenable to psychotherapy. The best we can do is make a person aware that this is what they're like and perhaps they can correct for themselves if sthey choose to a little bit and not only that, we get into the narcissistic personality type and other types of character traits and they don't seem to be amenable... 

01:00:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

01:00:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE ...very much to psychotherapy. 

01:00:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH So these people don't have an inner enemy because they are not divided. They are in a sense, a manifestation of that energy. 

01:00:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:00:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH You know, and I didn't ever read this in a book, but in doing therapy myself what I found is that in childhood if a person was loved that's good, but if a person was able to love then they're not a narcissist when they grow up. That is if something attracted their love, someone, a grandmother, a mother... 

01:00:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:00:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Then, then they're okay when they grow up, that is the amount of love they receive isn't so important, it's the capacity to put it out that seems to be so important and psychopaths don't have that. 

01:00:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:00:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

01:01:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's ironic that psychopaths are able to continue as they do without destroying themselves much earlier on in the game. 

01:01:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. But it's very intelligent. 

01:01:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:01:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH This enemy. 

01:01:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:01:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Intelligent, uh, attentive, uh, purposive and without ambivalence. The rest of us are left with the attempt to be honest which means that we have to deal with all these, uh, complexities. 

01:01:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:01:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH So we're no, we're not, uh, we're not evenly matched. And interiorly this is true, too. So that almost everybody is watching this program I'm sure, uh, is in the position of having to deal with problems of self-acceptance 

01:01:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:01:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. This torturer that we have inside, this implacable torturer of ourselves is going to continue and continue unless we do something. And we are not equal to that torturer, because we ourselves are not psychopathic. So what do we do? 

01:02:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE What do we do? 

01:02:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah, well that's, uh, a lot of psychotherapy is about supporting a person's esteem and giving them the tools to cope with that torture. Many things to do. Right? But one of them is not to argue with that part of the mind. It's much smarter than the life-loving part. 

01:02:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I'm thinking now of Rudolph Steiner, the Austrian mystic who developed his, his own... He was considered a satanist... 

01:02:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

01:02:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Particularly by the Nazis at one time because he had developed a, uh, a trinity which included Christ and Lucifer and Ahriman, the Persian, uh, devil and he would descibe Lucifer as being a being of pure light, a fallen angel, a being of passion. Lucifer represented intellect. He represented art. He represented so much of our own creative force. He simply lacked love. There was no love whatsoever in... And Steiner felt that, you know, this force of Lucifer as he characterized it was very important within us for us to recognize and to see that in spite of this great failing, it made a great contribution to our life, as well. 

01:03:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. Right. Lucifer, the light carrier. 

01:03:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:03:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH If only we could, as people who wish to be, uh, to evolve as human beings, to be the best that the race can offer, right? If only we could have the resources that Lucifer has with, also with love. 

01:03:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:03:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Because love is the thing that redeems people. Love is what, when a child gives it out makes the child grow up to be a real person, right? And love is the thing that makes it impossible to harm another. 

01:03:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:03:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh, so Lucifer has everything but love, and he has many of the qualities of a psychopath, but he's using them for light. 

01:03:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. It would be a very dull world if we didn't have all of the art, the passion, the intellect that is represented by that force. 

01:04:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And in fact, what is in art, um, is, uh, it's a repository for wisdom. 

01:04:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:04:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh, Lucifer's brought us all kinds of wisdom and all kinds of light. Just add the love. For example, if you look at, uh, one of the things I'm interested is to put together art, music and literature with psychology. So for example, if you look at the paintings of Memling and you see those people, the faces, or the faces on the statues and bas reliefs in Chartres... 

01:04:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:04:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH You see people who have evolved. 

01:04:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:04:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. And we have to owe that to Lucifer. 

01:04:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:04:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

01:04:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The other demon that Steiner describes, Ahriman represents sort of the heavy, the slothful, the lazy... 

01:04:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

01:04:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE ...forces and, and I would tend to think that that is, is much more insidious, that it's not so much out of malice that we cause great, uh, great difficulty for ourselves, but out of carelessness, out of slothfulness. 

01:05:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. Heedlessness. 

01:05:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:05:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. In fact, the destructive element seems to me to be there at all times, very intelligent just waiting for a moment, as if there were microorganisms everywhere and if our immune system goes down we get sick. 

01:05:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:05:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH But it's always there. 

01:05:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. That's why you mentioned the term vigilance earlier. 

01:05:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH That's right. The opp-, yeah. So, so I think you're right and that is the, the element in us of heedlessness, is the thing that gets us into real trouble. We don't look and we're in big trouble. 

01:05:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Do you think it's possible to be always vigilant? 

01:05:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Well, do you? 

01:05:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE No, I don't. I'd like to think that it was. But I mean, it, it's a sad fact I suppose about human life that if, if you lose your awareness it takes only a split second to prove irreparable damage. 

01:05:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Irreparable. We all drive on, we all drive cars, for example. 

01:05:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:06:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Just last night I was driving somewhere and right in front of me a car went through a red light another car hit him on the side. Both cars were demolished. 

01:06:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:06:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And I watched the thing happen. So one moment and we can be finished. We're all very vulnerable, but perhaps we can't get all the way to perfection. 

01:06:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:06:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH But can we approach it? And in the approaching of it, isn't that our perfecting of ourselves? 

01:06:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ultimately, I think we all have to die. We all have to come to terms with death, with, with our disolution, with our decay. And I suppose the issue is, is, is what of ourselves do we bring to that moment? 

01:06:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH So what you're saying is that you, too feel that you'd like to move toward being aware moment after moment. 

01:06:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:06:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And loving moment after moment. 

01:06:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:06:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And interiorly that's gonna involve your feeling loving toward yourself. 

01:06:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:06:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. Well, that goes on for a certain length of time and then what happens? 

01:07:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I don't know. 

01:07:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Well, it seems to me what happens is that we, we feel wonderful and we're winging it and then something or another happens to what people call 'press our buttons.' 

01:07:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Oh, yes. The melodrama of life continues. Right. 

01:07:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Somebody was... 

01:07:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE One does not maintain a pure loving state normally. 

01:07:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Exactly. So then if you look at the psychotherapeutic path as being the spiritual practice for us contemporary American people... 

01:07:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

01:07:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Then it would be that our, our way working might be that we attempt to become less and less heedless by taking care of the neurotic things that, that take our attention. For example, let's say that I'm phobic about people wear green hats because somebody was at a funeral with a green hat. Well, I can deal with that, work it through and then when I see a green hat I don't lose my attention and the destructive part doesn't come in and grab me. 

01:07:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:07:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH It seems to me that that's a whole spiritual practice that can go on a whole a lifetime. 

01:07:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Let's go back to the patient of yours you mentioned earlier who had the breast removed. 

01:08:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

01:08:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Was having a hard time communicating this to anybody. 

01:08:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Who actually didn't communicate it to anyone. 

01:08:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Would, would you say that people should develop, uh, an accepting, a loving attitude to this or should they re-, have an implacable attitude towards a disease, like, or should they fight? 

01:08:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Well, I know about people. I'll tell you about that woman. Uh, that woman needed to fight for her life and she's still alive, I'm happy to say. It's been more than five years. 

01:08:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:08:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH She fought and fought and she stayed in, in good relation to herself and she esteemed herself and she wished to live and it sobered her up and she got to do things she wanted to do that she postponed, and what would have happened if she had included her friends which are very New Age people, is that she would've been rejecting of herself. 

01:09:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:09:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And she couldn't have fought her disease so well. So for her, she had to do it alone. 

01:09:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So there is a sense in which what sometimes goes under the guise of self-acceptance may really be a kind of caving in to this destructive force. 

01:09:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

01:09:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And this is what we need to be vigilant for. 

01:09:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. That's what I meant when I said don't pardon it and don't accept it. Right. I don't think that is, needs to be accepted. What has to be accepted is all the things about us that are, that make us proud to be human beings. 

01:09:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:09:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Our capacity to become to be kind. 

01:09:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:09:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH To be intelligent, to add to the creation. 

01:09:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words, we can learn to accept our unwillingness to forgive evil within us. 

01:09:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yes. 

01:09:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Isn't that interesting? 

01:09:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Well that's the whole...That of course, gets rid of the insanity defense. 

01:09:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

01:09:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And I mean the daily insanity defense, like I dumped on you. I just couldn't help it. I had PMS. Right? No excuse. You had PMS but you did it anyway. And it's, it's a, it's an easier position to, um, to form a foundation for a real ethical human life without being uptight but I mean being life affirming. 

01:10:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. Yeah. Kathy, you've been involved in teaching and working with the Gurdjieff tradition for a long time and in that tradition as I understand it, the human being is, is viewed as containing many puppets, many little autonomous voices and, and entities. As we talk about, you know, the various types of, of demons th-, that can exist within us, I suppose these, these are the puppets. 

01:10:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

01:10:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In a way. 

01:10:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. And some of these people should not be allowed to be in power. 

01:10:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:10:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH I mean, they're riff-raff, internal riff-raff. 

01:10:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE They're all vying for control. 

01:10:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH That's right. 

01:10:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's as if we have the whole society within us. 

01:10:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

01:10:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Criminal elements and other elements in... 

01:10:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. And the criminal elements we can't, we have to separate them and contain them. 

01:11:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:11:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Not to torture them back. Then we'd be part of the criminal element. 

01:11:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:11:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right, but not to pardon. It's a, it's an important point, I think. 

01:11:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:11:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Otherwise, we collaborate. 

01:11:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So, there's a sense in which when one treats oneself with a, a balance, a judiciousness, a, a weighing and careful winnowing of these things th-, that one can really free oneself from, from this tendency to self-sabotage. 

01:11:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Of course. Uh, if we understand that that is our enemy and that's sabotaging, that's really what it's doing. It's really draining our energy. It's as if it embezzles and it constantly embezzles our energy. 

01:11:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:11:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Then we, we simply won't let it be in the company any longer. 

01:11:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:11:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Not to, not to kill it but not to let it touch the books. Right? Uh, I think that if I see anything my clinical practice it's this thing, every day of the week. How to stop undermining ourselves. 

01:12:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. Well, it's such important work. I wonder if you have some thoughts, Kathy about translating the work you do with individuals to the larger social problems that we face? I mean, these things are so insidious, the tendency to rubberneck... 

01:12:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

01:12:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The tendency of newspapers and television to focus in on death and destruction, to, kind of, cultivate that part of ourselves. Where do we begin at a social level to combat that? 

01:12:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH I wish I knew. I remember something that Krishnamurti said, you probably remember, also. He said if there were 200 people in the world that wanted light, the whole world would be different. But there aren't. Uh, the society is what it is. They all... The reason I became a therapist and I suppose this, I'll ask you if it's, has anything to do with why you did, is because I didn't see any sociological way. 

01:12:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:13:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH I thought the only way to do it is to change myself and maybe if, maybe foster a few other people, push them a little in that direction. I don't know what to do about sociologically. I suppose one thing would be to eliminate all insanity defenses. 

01:13:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words, to encourage people to take greater responsibility for, for it all of the time. 

01:13:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH All the time. 

01:13:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:13:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH But that, the trouble with saying that is it goes along with people whose, often whose personalities are authoritarian and I'm not. 

01:13:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:13:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH So, I hate to join that camp. 

01:13:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:13:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH But, what do you think? You also have chosen not to work in the political level. You're also not a theologian, so you haven't worked on that level. You've decided to work interiorly with people one by one. 

01:13:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE As, as a therapist... 

01:13:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

01:13:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But also as we're doing now, I feel like we have to keep the conversation going. 

01:13:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

01:13:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We have to talk about these things. 

01:13:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

01:13:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We have to address these issues. 

01:14:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

01:14:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And if through working in video and the media that we can call people's attention to these areas of life which are not often thought about or discussed, I don't think that in normal social discourse people are, are quite willing to, to see the devil within themselves. 

01:14:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. You know, uh, so we're doing something sociological right now, huh? 

01:14:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In a sense. 

01:14:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And politically. 

01:14:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah, in a small, small way. 

01:14:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH A small way. 

01:14:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:14:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH It's really important that people know that if they're happy, they're doing an enormous service to humanity. 

01:14:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:14:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH That is, someplace in Uspenskii's "In Search of the Miraculous," uh, Gurdjieff is attributed to it, it said that Gurdjieff said that work is about being happy and sustaining that happiness. 

01:14:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:14:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH If you could think what it is to be, to actually live in a happy way you wouldn't be rubbernecking. You wouldn't be looking at the television, looking at all kinds of guts spilling out all over tube. You'd be, uh, you'd be repleat. You'd be abundant. You'd be harmless. You'd be concerned. You'd be humane. Right? So if, if a person can learn not to undermine themselves and if they can learn to be happy, wouldn't that be a contribution. 

01:15:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I would think, you know, the real issue about self-sabotage, about these diabolic parts of ourselves is that they rob us of our potential for fulfillment, for real joy. 

01:15:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. Not only that, but they make us, um, constricted and, uh, possibly malevolent towards others. 

01:15:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. And I, I suppose the, the great tragedy in our culture is that so many people seem in a way to be resigned to accept that is, is part of their life, but once a person commits themself to finding genuine, deep happiness, deep joy in their life that out of the commitment there comes the, the resources, the will to, to begin to address the-, these issues that so much of our society tends to skirt over. 

01:16:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. And of course, they will see those issues from the point of view of peace. That is they will see it from a balanced point of view, an objective point of view, because they'll be balanced. 

01:16:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:16:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH It's as if happiness is the, in my camera anyway there are two halves of a circle and when I line them up, then the camera is in perfect focus and it takes a picture. Happiness is like that. If you could perfect your happiness, you can make love not war, you know? You wouldn't, you wouldn't be contributing aggression to society. But to be happy you have to take care of the inner enemy. 

01:16:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:16:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

01:16:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And it's interesting because we can look you, you mentioned, uh, Mother Theresa... 

01:16:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

01:16:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Here is a woman who seems to be expressing great happiness. 

01:16:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

01:16:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And seems to really be working in her own way for the benefit of suffering... 

01:16:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Mm-hmm. 

01:16:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE ...people. I may not disagreed with her stand on abortion or with other issues but if as we look at her soul, you can see this is a woman who is, as you say, united within herself. 

01:17:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

01:17:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE If we could find that within ourselves, an there isn't too much room for it. 

01:17:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH No, there isn't. And you know, it seems to me that, um, it's very important us her as an example of happiness because some people think happiness is climbing into a hot tub with a peacock feather or something. 

01:17:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Or my next raise. 

01:17:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Exactly. 

01:17:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Or a better job, or a bigger house. 

01:17:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. Or a 27-inch television in, in the family room, but happiness is something that's very individual. Often it has to do with creativity. 

01:17:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:17:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh, it's, it's the opposite of boredom and malevolence, and I think one terrible problem people have is a kind bored passivity. 

01:17:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:17:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH So that, to actually focus on what makes you happy and to do what you like moment after moment is a big practice. 

01:17:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. It seems that as people get caught up in boredom, that's when they're drawn to the face of death. 

01:18:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

01:18:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE For example, people I, I think, I will never go to horror movies, I have to tell you that. 

01:18:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. 

01:18:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I'm not interested in them, but I know they very well and I wonder if the people who, who flock to these horror films just need to be shaken out of their boredom by terror. 

01:18:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. And I think that when a person has identified with that inner enemy, they think they are that eye, one of the many eyes, the subpersonalities that comprise their psyche, then they want to see that, that part just loves murder and violence. 

01:18:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:18:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH But when a person takes their attention and identifies with what in them is constructive, they no longer want to see horror movies. 

01:18:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. Well, you know, we, we talked a little earlier about the New Age movement and one of the difficulties with that movement being perhaps a little all-too forgiving, a little too unwilling to see the dark side of things, but in a sense what you seem to be saying if I can extrapolate is, is that if we're to really address the question of this self-sabotage, of this evil within ourselves and within society, what is required ultimately is, is some kind of a large-scale social movement where people are really committed to work on themselves. 

01:19:20
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Yeah. And each person individually committed would make all the difference. 

01:19:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:19:25
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And I think the second thing, uh, that if the New Age people could remember that empathy is the key, then they would put themselves in position of my patient, stepped into her shoes and realized what it feels like to have a breast amputated and realize it doesn't help if somebody says, "What did you do to cause that?" All it was was a lack of empathy on the part of her friends. 

01:19:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:19:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH So that without any theological position or any, any decision on politics if people would only put themselves in other people shoes... 

01:20:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:20:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

01:20:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Because it seems to me that from a position of empathy the same question could have been asked in a very loving and helpful way. 

01:20:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Of course, but you know it wouldn't be. 

01:20:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:20:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And in the same way if we had empathy for ourselves we wouldn't allow this enemy to torture us or judge us as it does so frequently. It's as if there is a tickertape going in our minds. Is our stock up? Is it down? Is it up? Is it down? You know,I do group therapy, uh, and after groups I see people individually and often they say, "Did I say the right thing? Oh my god, I said the wrong thing." 

01:20:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Are you sure? Yeah. 

01:20:40
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Um, the French call that the logic of the staircase. What we think we should've said as we're walking down the stairs after a party. There is a way that we kick ourselves and, and, uh, judge ourselves and we, and its relentless. 

01:20:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. And that's the very time when we often think, 'Yes, I'm working toward self-improvement... 

01:21:00
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

01:21:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That we're really sabotaging ourselves. 

01:21:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH That's right. There's a way to give information of a negative nature that isn't attacking. 

01:21:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. 

01:21:10
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Everybody who ever learned a skill has to receive a lot of negative information. 

01:21:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:21:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH You can't learn to play the piano without making, or ski without making lots of mistakes but it doesn't have to be an attack. 

01:21:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE This is very subtle. It's very tricky because, as you said earlier, we need to be unforgiving towards this evil within ourselves but the key is to recognize what part of ourselves is that part. 

01:21:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Exactly, because what really happens most of the time, standard operating procedure for neurotics is they're unforgiving toward what's real in themselves. Right? That part is the one that's always on the docket trying very hard to plea bargain do other things to defend itself. 

01:21:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:21:45
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And we don't have the right part, uh, on trial. 

01:21:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Mm-hmm. It's really the judge itself that should be on trial. 

01:21:55
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH The whole inner system is what's corrupt. The judge itself in the inner establishment, the whole super ego and the primitive witchy sorcerer underneath the super ego and what should be judged. 

01:22:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. 

01:22:05
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right. 

01:22:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know, it's interesting because when I was at the school of criminology at Berkeley, that's the tact that we were taking back then in the early 70s, looking at the criminal justice system... 

01:22:15
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Uh-huh. 

01:22:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE ...to see how it caused crime and, uh, of course, that point of view didn't fly too well. There was soon a lot of financial and political pressure and now there no longer is a school of criminology at Berkeley. 

01:22:30
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH When you think of the degree of collaboration it's, it's almost unbearable. 

01:22:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

01:22:35
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH Right? The whole system is set up to, uh, to support the criminal element and to go against that is to be almost alone. 

01:22:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. But that truly is the great adventure of life. 

01:22:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH I can't imagine anything I'd rather do. 

01:22:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Uh-huh. Kathleen Speeth, what a pleasure to have you with me today. 

01:22:50
DR. KATHLEEN SPEETH And I'm glad to be here. 

01:22:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Thanks so much. I'm glad to have come. 

01:22:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And thank you very much for being with us.
