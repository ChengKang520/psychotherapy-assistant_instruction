PETER I was at paranoia, I thought people were following me or the people were out to get me, delusions I’ve been convinced that the mafia are after me or that ICO(ph) had bagged my phone. I’ve had IDs of reference where thought the TV or the radio had special messages for me. I’ve had visual hallucinations, I see flashes of light and I’ve heard voices as well when I’m sick I can’t distinguish between my voice, my own thoughts and the voices.

SHAUNA I got diagnosed when I was 21 that was when I had my first psychotic episode and I was taken to hospital. I’d been taking drugs not just prior to the episode but you I had been experimenting with drugs and stuff that was the first time I was given a diagnosis and you know told I had a mental illness and put on medication. 

00:01:35
ABIGAIL Some people have diabetes or some people have dizziness and my illness is a mental illness. I think some people have this idea that you the brain needs to be perfect because it’s where I’m. You know it is where I live and if that gets distributed then, then I’ve been you know obliterated or I’ve been um damaged me, me, the essence of me. And this is not true. 

00:02:05
SIMON I got sick first of all when I was 17 which is a long time ago and now four week ago I was sick again with another episode that lasted about a month. So it is a life-long learning for me. I’ve never been well longer than 10 months. For me life has always been about trying to learn how to live with the illness. 

00:02:30
Living with Schizophrenia 

00:02:30
DR ANDY CAMPBELL Consultant Psychiatrist Schizophrenia the popular concept at the moment is someone who experiences things that aren’t there like hears voices that aren’t outside but they hear them in the head anyway or sees things that aren’t actually there. So the mind creates a false image of the external world. Because we are so used to the mind giving as a real image it is very hard to recognize with most things are not real. But the more fundamental thing that we’re now becoming aware of is, it’s a disorganization of thinking. People can experience difficulties in focusing their thoughts, in remembering what’s happening, in planning, in dealing with complexity if things get too complex I started to feel overwhelmed by that complexity but can function okay when things happening in an ordered way. Those are often problems that start up before people actually start to experience the other problems with voices that there is… we often see what we call the prodrome where people find more difficulty relating to the family they work, the environment, withdrawing and then that goes on and having increasing difficulty in getting voice… 

00:03:50
SHAUNA WINRAM I was really extroverted and very loud at school and did all the public speaking competitions and things and then I became quite detached from lot of the school friends and and became a bit introverted and quiet and um yeah I felt really isolated and I couldn’t talk to anyone about it. 

00:04:10
DR ANDY CAMPBELL What did happens is that people can experience the first of the psychosis which is the experiencing voices talking all pattern, feeling people threatening, hearten… sensitivity heartened, sense of threat and that’s very, that’s a scary part and that’s when it usually declares itself within people that’s obviously there is a problem. 

00:04:35
SIMON CHAMP I think one of the biggest struggles for lot of people is one accepting that they’ve got the illness, then accepting that they may need some medication and most people do and then the long process which is a long process for most people of actually figuring out how the medications are going to work? Which one is best for them and I guess the need to to experiment with your doctor’s support to find the best medication for you. 

00:05:05
Medication 

00:05:05
SIMON CHAMP I think ideally you’ve some sledge for you, almost you’re gonna need a good psychiatrist or good doctor who can give you some advice on medication and how… how to fix you and um in the early stages it’s really important to get the right kind of medication because there is now a range of medications and what may not work for some people might work for you. Get good advice about the dosage that you need because it can vary so much from individual to individual. It’s very important to know what side effects are happening and to get help with any side effect and if it’s becoming too uncomfortable you can’t live with it, you change medications. I think a lot of people go off their medication because they’re getting side effects but they don’t talk about it and then they get their symptoms back because even if you come off your medication you should do it in stages, if you go too quickly it can really play havoc. 

00:06:05
SHAUNA WINRAM As on in a couple of dreadful things at first that gave me side effects that I didn’t realize of side effects and I think that is one thing I could get angry about is that no one sat me at the time and spoke to me and said you could be getting these side effects. 

00:06:25
ABIGAIL MASSON-COX When I first started on medication I started on the medication which eventually started giving me sort of jerky movements you know like my arm would just go like that sort of thing. I, I told my psychiatrist about the jerky movements and he put me on to another medication which unfortunately didn’t controlled the illness as much as the first medication had. Then we tried a different medication and I’ve been on that medication ever since then and that’s one of the latest medicines and things… But you know it is really important to talk to your doctor when, when you know that the medicine isn’t working or when it’s giving you side effects that are the dangerous, because there are some side effect which can be dangerous. So it’s really important when you’re having symptoms that you can’t manage that you talk to your psychiatrist about it and I talked to my psychiatrist about it you know and I think enough for that reason among millions of other reasons I think that you… I tend to need a psychiatrist I can trust and I can trust my psychiatrist. And I trust him absolutely you know and I mean he doesn’t, I mean he doesn’t do anything in my treatment without asking me first without consulting me first and and so I feel I’m involved in my, in my recovery, in my, in my treatment. 

00:07:55
SIMON CHAMP The medication that I’m on now generally I see it as a kind of design in drug really that enhances my performance um where as some of the older ones that I was on um really did flatten up my emotions and I think they can play havoc with your libido and stuff like that sometimes and, and they can, some of them put on weight which is one of the worst things for me. Um but it’s a kind of a try it off you know because you want to have this clear mind. 

00:08:30
DR ANDY CAMPBELL All antipsychotic drugs did control the major positive symptoms of schizophrenia, however, because of the inevitable side effects it go with most drugs um, people have a lot of difficulty attacking them with strong resistance. I believe what’s important as a clinician to work out what is the optimal dose which is the minimum dose that will control symptoms, positive symptoms adequately without causing a necessary side effects. The next question is for how long do I have to take it? And we haven’t got any clear guidelines so that yet have, it does saying that there are risks with stopping medication even after 12 months of being functioning well and symptoms-free perhaps back at work, the relapse rate is still unacceptably high. 

00:09:20
• There is a high relapse rate after stopping medication •Relapse may cause more emotional and psychological damage •There is some evidence that people may not respond as well to the medication the second time 

00:09:20
DR ANDY CAMPBELL There is also a risk of relapse will cause further psychological and emotional damage and there is some evidence now I’m noticing that people don’t respond as well to medication the second time around, if people are doing well on medications we found an optimal dose that’s a good idea to stay on it for longer period of time. There will be some people who’ll need to take medication for long from there is something that people have to prepare themselves so that there is a possibility. 

00:09:50
SHAUNA WINRAM Last year I tried to go off one of my medications twice I tried to go off it and within five days I was sort of getting anxiety and going rude. I don’t think medication is the only answer. I think it is one aspect. Going back to that question taking medication it was like when I was younger to accept right okay I have a mental illness so I stay on my medication um and I accepted that but that didn’t make life perfect you know it didn’t you know those are… these other aspects um or they saw the things I had to do. 

00:10:35
Psychological Management 

00:10:40
SIMON CHAMP Often people talk about stages they go through and accepting they’ve got an illness like schizophrenia um you know there is denial, there is anger there is a gradual acceptance this, this a way through that journey to, to accept that you have an illness like schizophrenia. People really need help with the price I think. Ideally a lot very rare the people do get it they, they need ah, ah they may benefit from the the advice of a good psychologist or good counselor um because I think part of my wellness is, is in working through the emotions that I have with associated with the illness and trying to understand my life better so that it doesn’t… I don’t have as many hassles with life that can trigger stress. I think particularly at certain stages of recovery um that the stuff I was talking about with the grief that you know I’ve got this illness in my life so I have got the stuff to work those through is really important and it’s extreme phase I mean like in reality nearly everybody that I know that had schizophrenia at some stages thought about suicide and a lot of them never had the chance to talk about that and probably a lot of ones that I know that have killed themselves. I’ve, I’ve never had the chance to work that through. And the reality is that some 15% of people with schizophrenia will commit suicide within that first five years of their diagnosis. My feeling is that a lot of their deaths were avoidable because it’s often internalization of stigma and stuff rather than people acting out some delusional thought. People need to talk about that, you know they need to talk about their feelings of worthlessness or their feelings of despair about having the illness in the early stages and work it through in some positive way. When I was younger, I would just go into psychosis, it’ll be a gradual process, but I wouldn’t really recognize what was happening and eventually I’d be psychotic and, and I’d be so inappropriate, other people would respond to me and say, you better take medication. Whereas as I have gotten older, I actually feel the changes myself and usually I pick the fact that my thinking is becoming strange and, and try and do something about it. Some people talk about a signature pattern, which is actually like recognizing certain signs in your thinking or certain behaviors ah that you do when you’re starting to get unwell, and if you see them coming on, well then you start to do something to prevent it. A lot of people with schizophrenia that I know actually ask their friends to help them monitor their condition. You know very often the people close to you would, will pick up signs that you’re becoming unwell, perhaps even before you do. 

00:13:35
PETER SCHAECKEN Good morning, Peter Schaecken speaking. Hi… I was on the verge of becoming unwell um, in the early stages I might recognize it, but ones I started getting symptoms I might not recognize that and I might need to help of a friend to get…get help from the mental health service. I’ve developed my own early intervention plan, net details, what are the early indicators of stress? What are my early warning signs? What action I should take, for example if I was becoming unwell, I might for example try and take some time off work, I would ring up the crisis team and ask to speak to someone there and get to see a doctor and ask put my medication up and things like that. I want to change my environment. I could take, could go away for few days, and cancel appointments. I’ve given a copy of my early intervention plan to my best friend. Basically, I rely on her to tell me that if I’ve got any of the symptoms, if I’m not able to do it myself. And she will know if I sound different over the telephone or when we made out or… I’m scared about anything or paranoid about anything, she’ll pick that up and she’ll, she’ll know what to do because she has got permission to take action based on that early intervention plan. 

00:15:05
Got permission from you? 

00:15:05
PETER SCHAECKEN Yeah. The early get help the better. 

00:15:10
DR. ANDY CAMPBELL One of the unrecognized and difficult things to grasp about experiencing schizophrenia is that there is often a cognitive dimension to the whole problem. People have difficulty with organizing their thoughts, their memories and they have difficulty with concentration they have difficulty focusing on events. 

00:15:35
PETER SCHAECKEN The thing with cognitive symptoms is often the professionals don't talk to consumers about those issues. And here, you are wondering why you’re struggling at work or study and it often is not because of the psychotic symptoms, it’s because of the cognitive impairment which people sometimes experience. And yet it's not talked about and the professional don’t seem to understand it very much, but I know from myself um I’ve problems with my memory. They’re not major problems, but they're major enough so that I may need things repeated to me differently and some things I have no recollection of, it’s for example and some problems that affects me in the workplace when I’m learning a new job, that’s happened to me in the past. It has taken me a bit longer to learn job than someone else because of those problems with memory and concentration. 

00:16:40
DR. ANDY CAMPBELL Not everyone has natural(ph) discernible cognitive impairment. However, it’s escalation is very important for me to understand. It’s also very important for the person whose I mean to live with the illness found out where their strengths and weakness are and that can be done in a practical way or can be done with psychological testing. Then you plan how to deal with issues like how to deal with memory? How to deal with poor concentration? How to deal with focusing problems? And there are simple stages at work once that problems are recognized. 

00:17:20
PETER SCHAECKEN What has been helpful for me was concentration is work environments where there isn’t too much noise happening at moment on work in a building with one of the person and that’s good for, that’s good for me. I can handle that situation. I’m a big believer in being organized and planning and I use a diary religiously and I would write things down in my diary, even things I have to do on the weekends. I would write them in my diary and that’s how I remember things. So, I’m not relying on memory. Now, all I’ve got to do is look in my diary and that tells me what I have to do, if I can ring someone up or whatever, I use that everyday. 

00:18:05
SHAUNA WINRAM When I was 22, it was finally like I can’t keep doing this, I have to really make changes in my life because I’m not going to survive unless I’m work out a way of getting better. 

00:18:25
Lifestyle 

00:18:30
SHAUNA WINRAM There are fundamental things in staying well, just the basic things like getting enough sleep because sleep deprivation is like the worst thing for me, I think you know couple of nights without sleep would be in hospital I’m just telling how. So sleep, getting enough sleep um you know trying to eat right, trying to do a bit of exercise, not taking drugs. I mean I’ll have a drink occasionally and I smoke tobacco thereon, I wouldn’t touch any other sort of drugs. I did when I was younger, but I wouldn’t now at all. Things like that are just basic can keep your life together sort of things. I can’t do as much as maybe the majority of people who get up at six every morning and get home at seven. I’m gradually taking on more and more but I’m in a position where if I can’t do something I don’t do it. I sort of put my mental health before most of the things and if I’m getting stressed then I won’t to be able to say well, no I can’t do that, I need to stay at home, I need to rest. In other times, when I was like, no I should do that because I need to get out because I’m going to get lost in my own, you know apathy or whatever and just knowing how much you can take on board not taking on too much, but also having enough of a structure to keep you motivated and keep you positive. I started tai chi about two years ago and I think more than anything it’s a structure in my life because I go to three classes a week and I have a good teacher and the people I do with good people and I just become so immersed in it that it’s, it’s just a break from everything else, I mean it’s sort of trying to focus my mind and relax rather than waking up and sort of like Oh! And certainly well okay I can go to the graveyard and practice for now or you know it’s sort of gives me a structure to bounce off and I think that’s important. I mean exercise is just good friend often(ph) I’ll go for swim you know 20 laps, you feel great afterwards. 

00:21:05
SIMON CHAMP They say that schizophrenia or madness is irrational and out of control, but in actual fact there is… are things that you can do that give you control over those symptoms. You can live a healthier lifestyle to try and avert the symptoms coming on. Um you know some of the you know good sleeping patterns and good eating habits and good exercise will to some extent moderate the symptoms. They might not go away completely, but it will help um is the likelihood that you’re going to get sick. I think a lot of the trauma that people go through, particularly when they’re first diagnosed is often they think of their life as they expected it is over. That may not be the case, but it may be the case that they’ll have to rethink how they live life for a while. And it can take some times some while or some years before somebody really gets to manage their illness well and is able to do what they want to do with their lives. Often you’re forced to reevaluate your life in many ways. While one of the ways that from me has been a challenge, I guess is that there were many times where I couldn’t work and schizophrenia really interfered with my, my lifestyle and so I sort of searched for a meaning in my life outside of work to some extent, you know I work when I can, but there’s been another periods where I haven’t worked. There’s always options of voluntary work or studying or something like that to, to fill up your life, but I think automatically it’s valuing you, you are as a person was the important thing. And when you got schizophrenia, there is a lot of messages out there in society that you’re no good or you’re a less a person and turning that around can be quite hard for somebody when they’re first diagnosed. And I think the reality is that you’re somebody with a very disabling illness at times and you know a lot of people live their lives very courageously trying to overcome that and that’s all of them seen by society. And so, I mean like realistically assessing the fact that you’re living a with disability and it takes energy and effort to overcome that and giving yourself credit for that is… is part of how you restore your self-esteem I guess. Often people with schizophrenia do get back into the workforce to get into relationships to get back into study, but often it’s a lengthy process to get back into societies they want to. And so, in a way you have to live life around your disabilities some times and people assume that that’s going to be a negative thing, and then sometimes there are riches in… in… in accepting your illness and living with it that are unexpected. But I think a lot of people with schizophrenia also choose a lifestyle that accommodates the illness. And that maybe quite important for some people who find it hard to get back into full time work or I mean like it’s like me I, I’m an artist and I work part time when I can, but I have a very unconventional life in many ways, but it’s actually a good life for my schizophrenia. It keeps me well. Um you know my hours are very flexible, so if I do need time out I can take time away and it doesn’t disrupt my lifestyle too much. Um so, I guess I’ve adjusted to having schizophrenia. 

00:24:45
Marijuana and Other Drugs 

00:24:50
DR. ANDY CAMPBELL Leading on from (inaudible ) keep there is something that makes me paranoid. Most people I know who use marijuana because they like it because they feel relaxed. Um usually when people start getting the paranoid thing they will say this is no good I’m not going to touch that again, but if you’re into the relax feeling, your risk it being… 

00:25:10
SHAUNA WINRAM I started smoking pipe when I was about 15. Started to experimenting with it and was smoking at I guess you know kind of regularly when I was 16 that’s when I was sick you know I didn’t make that connection that’s not why I’m here which year later before who made that connection. 

00:25:30
DR. ANDY CAMPBELL The majority of young people I see who develop a psychosis are with smoking marijuana heavily at the onset. Although we know many people use dope, use marijuana without necessarily developing psychosis. Once people do start to develop psychotic symptoms I usually found they have to stop and any even a small amount of marijuana would rapidly bring back, bring on psychotic symptoms. Stimulants such as amphetamine and cocaine do induce psychotic symptoms. 

00:26:05
SHAUNA WINRAM These drugs say play with the chemicals and our brains and um… it’s like as you know they do affect different people differently, but if you haven’t been to illness you know or I just know how to fix me and I know that I don’t want my reality to shift. I want to be able to, it shifted when I was younger a lot and now I want to know when I have a fairly good idea of what’s going on and if I smoked a pipe, I wouldn’t know. You know it become confusing and it take me a while to work it out again and I don’t want that. 

00:26:45
DR. ANDY CAMPBELL One of the crucial things I think is what you can do is, let the people who’re trying to help you know what you’re doing, because if it’s stay as a secret, people think it’s something else, so don’t. If you’re saying, no, I’m not smoking then nobody, they’ll try and do something else. So it’s important to be open and let people know about that. 

00:27:05
Families 

00:27:10
There is times when you’re not when you haven’t been well and I know you get instead of the (inaudible ) that there is networks of care that you’ve got so it’s like what do I, what do I do to add to that? 

00:27:20
SIMON CHAMP The mental health system doesn’t really work much with families, and so a lot of families have a lot of complaints that they’re not involved in the… you know the treatment plans and stuff and I mean like it’s… I guess it even happens with me when I’ve come out of hospital, you know sometimes there’s not a real lot of thinking goes into who is going to actually care for me and make sure that I’m fed or you have been like eventually that I’ve got food in the house and stuff like that because sometimes I can’t do that kind of stuff by myself when I’m really sick. 

00:27:50
And that’s when the emergency package of tin jams(ph)and… 

00:27:55
SIMON CHAMP There are times when some times the dynamics of a family become difficult for somebody with schizophrenia and the person might want to withdraw or they might find it difficult to interact in ways that they used to and to recognize that and maybe moderate the lifestyle a bit to, to comment at the person, but the person still needs to have guidelines of how to live and…and you know I need it to be told that things were inacceptable when I was sick. 

00:28:20
I’m not going to just tip-toe around you because (inaudible ) I might set you off so that… it just… I think it’s really important that if I disagree with you, I’m going to tell you I disagree with you about things. 

00:28:35
SIMON CHAMP Yeah. 

00:28:35
You’re still… you just spot the (inaudible ). I’m not going to say you got an excuse for everything because you’ve got schizophrenia. That doesn’t work that’s something that’s rubbish is still with you. 

00:28:45
SIMON CHAMP It’s not a matter of pulling yourself together, you can’t be told to pull yourself together like a lot of families might tray and say to the person with schizophrenia. You’re not able to just snap out of it. Um it takes time and it takes a lot of work to be able to learn to manage this symptoms and to control what’s happening to you and so families have to understand that and it’s not easy. I think that’s part of the problem that the energy gets focused on the person that’s sick and the family members forget to look after themselves and sometimes where there is a long-term chronic mental illness you see family members getting sick or mentally fragile as well out of the stress that has caused, and so they need to find support for themselves, not about what to do about the person, but what to do with their own feelings that maybe they can’t do anything at that point in time to help the person. So then they had to deal with the feeling of helplessness themselves. 

00:29:45
If you’re really into, you’re out of your poetry or particular ideas and those times when I think this should not be concerned or should I, is this… I find that they’re not everything is a signpost, but, but I’m always thinking is that a sign post or…. 

00:29:55
SIMON CHAMP Yeah, but you're not the only one, I mean there is a problem with if you are living with schizophrenia… 

00:30:00
Yeah. 

00:30:00
SIMON CHAMP …you kind of monitor yourself in the same way. So if you get really excited about life and it's just natural excitement and you start to think I should… may be I’m getting sick again… 

00:30:10
Yeah. 

00:30:10
SIMON CHAMP …when I talk to you it's like checking my own reality. 

00:30:10
Yeah. 

00:30:10
SIMON CHAMP And… and sometimes you know I will sort of ask you ever gone too far or… I can easily tell when you are really worried because you said that you’ll check that out with your psychiatrist. 

00:30:20
Do I? He was pretty old friend. When you are getting unwell, you get very unwell to getting unwell ah… about thing oh you can there's… there's… there's a suffice we get… 

00:30:30
SIMON CHAMP Denial 

00:30:30
Because a definite denial for us and… 

00:30:35
SIMON CHAMP It's better now, but it was 20 years ago if you’d been trying to talk to me out of it 20 years ago you wouldn’t have had a hope. 

00:30:40
Yeah. 

00:30:40
SIMON CHAMP Yeah, whereas now, inner part of me is still listening… 

00:30:45
Yeah. 

00:30:45
SIMON CHAMP on some level. Watch for small steps of improvement you know, because it's a very gradual improvement in the earlier stages of Schizophrenia for a lot of people and to acknowledge and celebrate any progress that a person makes whether it is acceptance that they've got the illness because some people are in denial for a long time or whether it's somebody's ability to recognize their symptoms and act accordingly to avoid them or um… whether it's you know some people become very disheveled and… and dismissive of their self care and maybe they might need encouragement or… or… or recognition that they're starting to look after themselves better. Um… and I think also to, I mean like it's hard but to keep encouraging the person when the person loses hope to not lose hope with them to… to retain a picture of who they were and a vision for who they might become still um… but realistic ones in terms of acknowledging that the illness is a hard illness to live with and it's gonna be a struggle to get there. 

00:31:50
Whatever you're going through is generally a something you’re going through when there is another side. 

00:31:55
SIMON CHAMP Hmm… hmm… 

00:31:55
Like you… you do get well again. 

00:31:55
SIMON CHAMP Yeah, well it use to take a long time. 

00:32:00
It use to take… it use to take a long time but even then I think we'd still do stuff and would still be brothers and hang out and whether it's a beer or whether it's… 

00:32:10
SIMON CHAMP I’d just be dressed in really funny ways. 

00:32:10
Ah… you just have… you just had every style, but that's… that's actually nothing to do with your illness. You can't play that… that was… 

00:32:20
SIMON CHAMP Very often the illness comes on when a person is 18 or 19 or younger and at that stage a person is trying to individuate from the family and separate from the family and get… get a life of their own and often that process becomes really scrambled by the illness and the rebellion kind of becomes part of the illness and stuff and… and you know very often I see people that are older still trying to separate from their families, because they have had schizophrenia and they’ve never really been allowed the process of separation. I went… lived in a therapeutic community rather than home. I think I was one of the best choices I've made not because my family was a bad family, but because sooner or later you have to be independent and… and a lot of families prolong the process of becoming independent and I think that's again a message for families to encourage independence at every stage. 

00:33:15
Peer Support 

00:33:20
ABIGAIL MASSON-COX I think that the housing thing you know, the ah… the some group houses and the interim housing projects were, because I was in an interim housing project with other people who have psychiatric illness they… they can impart to you things that they know about the system in there and… and what's… what's available some of the things that are available and that was really important to me very important to me, because you know I wasn’t ah… getting ah… that information from… from my psychiatrist at that time and I didn’t know how to ask or what to ask for you know things like that. So… so having… having those people they use to share their experience to share their… to tell me… to tell me what was available was really important. I had some stability of housing of accommodation in which I hadn't had before, because I was always getting kicked out of places, you know kicked… kicked out of everywhere and I got kicked out of the last place and ended up on the street. So I didn’t have any money nothing, you know I was… I was unemployed, I was on benefits and all this and anyway ended upon the street I was there for a while and then I ended up in the supported housing. (inaudible ) women's interim ah… housing for women with psychiatric illnesses was a great place for me to be. Ah… because for the first time in a long I had stability of accommodation and also I was meeting people who're really good people and I was getting information, you know about the mental health system from… from other people who experienced the mental health system with the good things and the things to avoid and the things to you know, and I… and I was forming friendship with these people. I formed friendships with these people. Eventually, it didn’t added to me that I had been ill, because I had seen so many other people who were real and were just fantastic people, just fantastic people.

SHAUNA WINRAM I like my life, I like who I am on a good day. I think if you sort of learn to accept your illness not fight it, but to fight to… to fight to be well but to accept your illness is a part of you that can make you better you know, as a person may be. It's one way of looking at it.

ABIGAIL MASSON-COX On the medication, I feel… I do feel I can be me and I… and I’m me and I quite like who I am. I'm not striving for perfection any more. I know, I still get some symptoms, but I'm not worried about them and I… and the tear has been taken out hmm… but the, the symptoms and I'm pretty free to be me.

PETER SCHAECKEN I don’t see it is the end of the world. Whilst when I have had an episode those experiences have been very scary and stressful and disruptive to my life when I'm well, there is a lot of things I can do when I… I try and focus on the possibilities. I think your, your own attitude towards your… your illness plays an important part in staying well like any other illness that needs to be managed you can be vivid. I may okay about it, I would have preferred I didn’t have it but I've got it, I have to accept that I'm not the only one in the world with this illness. If you don’t manage your illness you can have relapses and end up in a hospital well I try and manage it, I try to stay on top. You know, I… I believe for most times I'm successful at doing that.

SIMON CHAMP The hardest thing that I ever do I think is talking to an 18 year old about who has just been diagnosed with schizophrenia, because I go back and I remember how terrifying it was for me and how frightening and how confusing and how long it took me to understand what was happening to me. Um… I think the… the thing that I was looking for initially was some hope that things would get better and for most people with schizophrenia things do get better with time and the symptoms moderate and people get more control over living with the illness. One of the things that people assume is that because they've got schizophrenia, life is gonna be awful and so the symptoms are awful and it's hard to live with. But you may still have a very rich life in spite of having a disability. Not that I'm the (inaudible) happy enlightened beam but you know I think ah… certainly I'll look at other people who don’t have Schizophrenia and you know there is a lot more people that are unhappy than I am.
