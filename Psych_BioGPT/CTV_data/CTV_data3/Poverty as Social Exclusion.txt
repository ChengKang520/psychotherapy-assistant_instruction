JILL HILL My name is Jill Hill and I’m an Assistant Professor in the Counseling Psychology program here. And it's my distinct pleasure to introduce my colleague Professor Laura Smith. And I just wanna provide a brief background for Professor Smith. She received her Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from Virginia Commonwealth University. She’s now an Assistant Professor in the Department of Counseling and Clinical Psychology here at Teachers College, Columbia University. Dr. Smith previously worked in a, in a variety of applied settings in New York City. She was formerly Director of Training of the APA accredited Pre-Doctoral Internship Program at Pace University. And she was also the Founding Director of the Rosemary Furman Counseling Center at Barnard College and the Director of Psychological Services at the West Farm Centre where she provided services, training and programming within a multifaceted community based organization in the Bronx. Dr Smith’s research interests includes social class and poverty, the influence of classism on psychological theory and practice, the development of socially just practice models for psychologists at the community level and Participatory Action Research or PAR in schools and communities. Current projects undertaken by Professor Smith and her research team include an ongoing PAR project in collaboration with the community based organization in the South Bronx and three other PAR projects in New York City public high schools and middle schools. Also Professor Smith has a book coming out this fall published by the TC Press entitled Putting our Practice to Work, psychology poverty and the end of social exclusion. And I just on a personal note, I just wanna add that Professor Smith is an amazing colleague and I feel so privileged and fortunate that she is my colleague in our program. So, I think you’re all in for a wonderful treat this morning. Thank you.

PROFESSOR LAURA S. SMITH Hi everyone. Thanks for being here with me today.

Poverty and Social Exclusion: Relational Dimensions of Social Class Stratification Laura Smith, Ph.D. Teachers College, Columbia University 

00:02:45
PROFESSOR LAURA S. SMITH What I hope this presentation will be is an invitation to you to add to the way that you maybe currently thinking about social class and poverty. 

00:02:55
an invitation • to you to stand in a different place as you consider your work in relation to poverty • to see yourself and your profession as interrelated parts of a larger system of social stratification • to bring your social justice orientation to bear on your understanding of that structure • to move beyond charity and sympathy… 

00:03:00
PROFESSOR LAURA S. SMITH To stand in a different place as you view the social location that, that we know as poverty. And some of that aspects of that different vantage point I hope for you will be to see yourself and your profession as interrelated parts of a system that also includes poverty and working class locations and that produces outcomes for other people in the social class structure that are related to the kinds of outcomes that you are experiencing yourself. And also to bring your social justice orientation to bear on that, to take the same kind of social justice and multicultural considerations that we apply to our understanding of other kinds of social positions and socially constructed identities to bring those to bear on social class. All of this I hope will invite you to move beyond charity and sympathy in the way that you think about poverty and social class. Sympathy and charity are understandable and will always be part, I think and important parts of the way that we relate to people who are, are living with economic disadvantage. But... But what I hope that we’ll do today is to identify some kinds of conceptual frameworks that will allow us to move beyond those. 

00:04:25
agenda •What is social class? •it’s not the differences in purchasing power •classicism as part of the social justice spectrum •adding a relational perspective: poverty as social exclusion •poor people are relegated to positions outside the life of the community and outside full democratic participation in society •re-thinking “help” for the poor •...and how psychological practice can be aligned with it 

00:04:25
PROFESSOR LAURA S. SMITH So, here is kinda structure for today for the conversation. First I’m going to talk a little bit about what social class is, kind of, it's, it's something that we don’t really talk about very much certainly in applied psychology although social psychologists and sociologists speak a lot more about it than we do. I’m going to talk about the operant form of oppression that works in social class that, that, that perpetuates social class advantage and disadvantage as classism. I would like to propose a new perspective on poverty that involves a relational perspective, specifically poverty as social exclusion, which will give us a way of thinking about how living in poverty is more than not just having as much money as other people and thereby not being able to buy the things that other people can buy. It's also a life that is sort of relegated by the rest of us to the margins. The fact that people who live in poverty are outside the life of the community in many ways and outside full democratic participation as citizens in, in this country. And we’re also going to talk about rethinking help for the poor. And how that sort of brings all of these kinds of considerations right home to us as helping professionals as and as practitioners. So what is social class? 

00:05:50
What is social class? The closest most folks can come to talking about class in this nation is to talk about money. bell hooks (2000) •beginning with power: seeing social class as part of the social justice spectrum •the problems with SES as a proxy (Krieger, Williams, & Moss, 1997; Zweig, 2000) •beyond income brackets: social class as “a... 

00:05:55
PROFESSOR LAURA SMITH I start with this quote from Bell Hooks. Her book is called Where We Stand: Class Matters, and the point being made there is most of the time what we talk about when we talk about social class is money as I sort of referred to before as, as differences in purchasing power, as who has enough money to buy all the things that they want in need and, and which other people don’t have that same ability to support themselves and their families. And in certainly again that’s a critical part of understanding social class. But... But let’s, let’s sort of take that step of applying social justice considerations to this more broadly. When we as practitioners, as educators, as psychologists, as counselors, think about our psychotherapeutic practice or other aspects of our professional function within a multicultural social justice framework, we’re, we’re sort of accepting their work takes place in a context that is characterized by broad forms of inequity with regard to access to resources and power. We are also accepting that our professional practice as a, as a field and as a sort of set of, of, of techniques that we carryout is embedded in that inequitable status quo. It was... It was sort of born from that status quo and it also is carried out within it so that the way that we think about ourselves as professionals and the way that we hear our clients' stories often can’t really be separated from sort of the impact of, of social forces and oppression in their lives. We... We know certainly as counselors and educators that the fact that we need to think about the impact of oppression in our clients' lives doesn’t mean that they don’t also have the ability to sort of act purposefully to improve that on circumstances certainly they do there would be no point in having educators or counselors if not, but we also know that oppression acts in such a way as to really shape differentially the kinds of starting points people have in life, the kind of opportunities they have, the kind of open or closed doors that we face. So, that two separate forms of oppression from the stories of distress or otherwise that our clients tell us is, is, is, it doesn’t make a lot of sense. Again I want us to try to start to apply that same thinking to social class, such that people who occupy higher social class positions, more privileged social class positions certainly tend to earn more money and property than people lower down. But they also have access to cultural power, to political power, to economic power, to social power in a, in a very different to a very different extent that people, than people do at other social locations. That is occupying a social class position kind of comes with a basket of stuff, right of assets and disadvantages. That’s very different from the baskets that other people have. One of the problems we're talking about those locations and the baskets of stuff that people get and each of them is that we’re pretty much without a shared handy way of speaking about social class classifications. This is one of the reasons not the only reason, but one of the reasons that I think we so often in psychology tend to use proxies for social class when we speak about the kinds of issues that we're raising. One of the most common being SES. Income brackets is another way that you see people kind of split up sometimes when social class, what’s called social class is, is incorporated into a particular study or piece of research. And... And what would be wrong with that after all? I mean, social class and social class labels are kind of like murky and wide ranging. You know there is upper class, lower class, middle class, wealthy, poor, disadvantaged, colors of collars, right, blue color, white color, pink color. How are we supposed to understand exactly what those groups are that constitutes social classes? And... And why not just use income brackets which seem kind of neat and clean or calculations like SES which are usually formulas that assign SES course to people based on things like income, educational level etc. Nancy Krieger is an Epidemiologist at Harvard who has written compelling about some of the, some of the problems with using SES based on its unreliability as an (inaudible ). She cites such problems as the fact that when you look at income or SES which incorporates income and its relationship to well being, it turns out that income isn’t just income that earned income or salaries and wages function in those formulas in a very different way than asset or dividend income. People who have earned income that they can live on sometimes without actually having to hold to job or work for wages and that when you look at how those two things work out, it makes it clear that to sort of lump them all together in the way that calculations like SES do, it doesn’t make sense. The SES taskforce on socio-economic status which issued a final report a few years ago came to similar conclusions about the unreliability of SES calculations. But for my purposes today those are not the only or, and perhaps not even the most important reasons for moving beyond SES to trying to talk about social class, within a social justice framework. When we were approach to any topic from a social justice perspective we need a language, we need a taxonomy that allows us to identify and speak about power explicitly. In considerations of power are exactly what is sidestepped by criteria like SES and income brackets, because, because for example looking at income as a way of, of, of, of indicating sort of economic viability implies that people fall along a continuum, same with SES. That it's sort of a smooth continuum of people who make a little more and a little less and the more you make sort of the better off you are and the less you make the less well off you are. Income brackets would imply for example that socio-cultural forces are operating in roughly equal ways to enhance or diminish the life chances of say a high school music teacher, a small business owner, a city sanitation worker and a factory assembly line worker who each make $52,000 a year. According to their incomes, they would all, if you’re classifying people by income brackets, be considered perhaps middle class and that that income level puts them just above the 2007 US Median Income of $50,000 of, of $50,023. Yeah, without even speculating as to the different cultural stereotypes right that come the way of people to occupy those, those different jobs, it's clear that power relationships in the world of work operate really differently among this group. As busy as they are, teachers exercise a lot of more freedom over the content and the pace of their workday. Then... Then say do the factory workers, who are much more likely to face very strict limits on the content and pace of their workday in the form of limits on the number of bathroom breaks they can take, being permitted or not being permitted to make phone calls, finding that they have to work forced overtime and dealing with the layoff of their entire workforce when a company decides to relocate overseas. The small business owner might work more hours than any of the rest of them in the group. But at the end of the day maintains a very different kind of socio-economic power. In that the small business owner actually has means to, actually has access to a means of production, right. If I own a small business, I have access to produce something by which I can earn a living. I’m not forced to sell my labor in a marketplace where wages often lag behind inflation. The... The... The... These kinds of differences continue when we consider the fact that these four individuals lives are affected differently by structural advantages such as the opportunity to benefit from tax write-offs, disadvantages such as limits on the freedom to organize in the workplace. These are structures built-in obviously by a federal legislature that doesn’t currently include wide representation among its members by poor and working class people, to say the least. So, you see when I talk about those four people, the high school music teacher, the small business owner, the factory assembly line worker, and the city sanitation worker, who each make the same amount of money. You begin to understand what I mean by these different baskets of structural assets and disadvantages that come to them based on their distance from or their nearness to sources of socio-economic power. These are the kinds of considerations that led (inaudible ) men like who, who are sociologists to talk about social class structure as not a smooth continuum of people who might be a little higher and might be a little lower than, than each other on that continuum, but instead as a deeply lumpy entity, that assets and advantages tend to clump together in characteristic ways based on the social class position that you occupy. 

00:16:50
foundations of class stratification theory class stratification theories represent the answers to three questions... • 1. How do class distinctions arise from economic distinctions? • 2. How are economic class distinctions reflected in social distinctions and social behavior? • 3. How do economically dominant classes interact politically with the other classes in a society? ...that correspond to the operation of 10 variables (Dennis Gilbert, 2008) Economic variables: occupation, wealth, income, and poverty Social variables: prestige, association, socialization, and social mobility Political variables: power and class consciousness 

00:16:55
PROFESSOR LAURA S. SMITH And those are the kinds of considerations that social class theories are meant to accommodate. So, social class theorists beginning with Karl Marx and Weber and Borgia(ph) and everybody on up to the present, have attempted to answer particular kinds of questions that correspond to the distributions of those assets and disadvantages, which also arise from the operation of 10 variables. This is a formulation that Dennis Gilbert, a sociologist has offered in terms of understanding social class theory broadly. Because if you read different theorists, if you read Borgia(ph), if you read Weber, if you read Marx, they have a lot of the same language and a lot of really different language that can make people like us who don’t sort of typically study those kinds of things in school wonder what it is they all have common. But what Dennis Gilbert explains, is that all social class theorists are trying to talk about the ways that these economic variables, these social variables and these political variables, which include power and class consciousness are all sort of operating in confluence in such a way that these lumpy kind of baskets of assets and disadvantages tend to result and class theorists in their model named those lumps, you know working class, bourgeoisie, the, the proletariat differently, they call them by different names based on sort of what they’re own preferred nomenclature is. 

00:18:35
a framework for social class Poverty: Predominantly working class people who, because of unemployment low-wage jobs, health problems, or other crises are without enough income to support their families basic needs. Working class: Have little power or authority in the workplace, little control over the availability or content of jobs, and little say in the decisions that affect their access to healthcare, education, and housing. Tend to have lower levels of income, net worth, and formal education. Middle class: Professionals, managers, small business owners often college-educated and salaried. Middle-class people have more autonomy and control in the workplace and more economic security, but rely upon earnings from work to support themselves. Owning class: People who own enough wealth an property that they do not need to work to support themselves (although they may choose to), people who own and control the resources by which other people earn a living. As a result of their economic power, they also have significant social, cultural, and political power relative to other classes. 

00:18:40
PROFESSOR LAURA S. SMITH In my work, I have sort of decided to use the framework of social class that you see before you. I've adapted my language for social class groups from the work of two theorists. Their work is really similar to each other. And this classification here sort of combines a lot of their ideas. The first one Betsy Leondar-Wright is a class activist, who has written a book called Class Matters and the second one Michael Zweig is an economist at SUNY Stony Brook. And the way that they understand groupings to result from the operations of all those variables in the lives of people is as follows. Poverty refers to primarily working class people who are without enough income to support basic needs. Working class people have little power authority in the workplace, little control over the availability of content and jobs and little say in the decisions that sort of affect their socio-economic lives. Middle class people are professionals, managers, owners etc. who have a lot more say in the way that sort of their socio-economic life unfolds, lot more say in the content and the pace of their work lives, that’s like me. Nobody tells me how many times I can go to the bathroom during the day. I can use the phone whenever I want to. Certainly I have responsibilities that I need to fulfill, but I have lots and lots of autonomy regarding the way that I go about fulfilling them. Usually people on the middle class make more money also than people on the working class but not always. We know that some union positions, for example people who’ve been in the union for a long time and have gotten promoted will sometimes make more money than people in the middle class for example a new professor a non-tenure-track professor at a really prestigious institution may make less than that person, but yet have more, right, power and authority in the workplace, in, in a socio-economic world. Finally, there is the owning class. These are people who own enough wealth and property that they don’t need to work. They can live form the earnings that they derived from the property and wealth that they own. They may chose to work sometimes they do, but, but they don’t need to. Moreover, they own the resources by which everybody else makes a living. So, they own the factories, they own the stores, they own the mines, they own the farms and all the other resources and spaces by which the rest of us make a living. Middle class people even when they make a lot of money and are highly skilled and, and carry a lot of prestige such as doctors and lawyers nevertheless, do need to work for a living but those are the people that we sometimes call upper middle class. I use that language sometimes too. 

00:21:35
classism • The oppression of the poor through a network of everyday practices, attitudes, assumptions, behaviors, and institutional rules” (Bullock, 1995, p.119) • A unidirectional function on the order of racism, sexism, heterosexism, and ableism, to be distinguished from prejudice • Encompasses institutional classism, through which social institutions function to perpetuate the deprivation and low status of poor people, and interpersonal classism, which is characterized by prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination (Lott & Bullock, 2006) • Examples include negative attitudes and beliefs regarding poor and working-class people, reduced access to basic services, environmental injustice, union-busting, and our lack of a living wage (Smith, 2008). 

00:21:40
PROFESSOR LAURA S. SMITH Classism, as I mentioned before is the, the word that I use to describe the form of oppression at work in the socio-economic structure within it that, that I just mentioned. And I follow Heather Bullock and Bernice Lott in the way that they have sketched out the definition of, of this term. You’ll see that Heather Bullock who, who is the Chair of the APA taskforce and SES has defined classicism as the oppression of the poor through a network of everyday practices, attitudes, assumptions, behaviors and institutional rules. In her writing with Bernice Lott later on, they broke out institutional classism from interpersonal classism. One of the implications of their formulation of classicism is that its a top down function. In that, certainly anybody can be prejudice against anybody else, right. Prejudice being a prejudgment. Certainly poor people can be prejudice against rich people, but when prejudice is added to power that is when prejudice is tied to all kinds of social and cultural polices, practices and procedures that can enforce it, that’s when we call it oppression and so that’s when we call it classicism. So, in my usage of the term, like these authors classicism is top down its not, its not sort of a correct therefore in my use of the term to think of it as being all relative. And some examples of, of classicism, I have listed for you here some are, are easy to see and some are hard to see. They include negative attitudes and beliefs regarding poor and working class people. They include the relative, the reduced access that poor people have to basic services like education, like legal assistance, like health care. I believe it also includes the deprecation of unions, union busting, the fact that, listen nobody wants to be inconvenienced by a strike right. I don’t either. I want all those people on whose labor I depend to go to work so that my trash is going to get picked up and, you know somebody is going to be driving the buses and the subways trains etc. But when working class people go on strike, they are bargaining with the one and only thing that they have, the only card they have to play in workplace negotiations, which is the value of their body showing up to do the job or not showing up to do that job. So, for me efforts to take away that one card, that working class people can play in work class, in workplace negotiations is, is antidemocratic and, and is classist. And I see a lack of a living wage in this country the same way. We depend on the work of low wage earners all around us. Our lives would come to a standstill, if they did not show up for the job, yet people in this country can work full time and still not be able to lift their families out of poverty. There is something about that that, I believe is, is classist to say the least and, and also has a, a moral underpinning and that people who work full time in necessary jobs shouldn't be living in poverty. 

00:25:10
system, and the system is part of us • "Poor Women are Still Shut out of Mainstream Psychology" (Saris & Johnston-Robledo, 2000) • "The near invisibility of the poor in psychology" (Lott, 2002) • "Fear of the poor" among therapist (Javier & Herron, 2002) • "Despite the important influence of socioeconomic status on an individual's life, this variable has been widely ignored" (Sue & Lam, 2002) • "The most important topics in poverty research have been almost totally neglected by psychologists" 

00:25:15
PROFESSOR LAURA S. SMITH So, how does that operate within our profession. It's certainly not true to say that psychologist counselors etc. aren't concerned about the poor, they are, examples of altruism in our field are easy to, to identify. The issue is more that we just cannot to think about poverty and, and working class issues in terms of our theorizing or in terms of the way we formulate our practice and so often our theory and practice tends not to be so relevant to their lives. It's more that we just leave them out as all of the quotes that you see here attest. It's... It's mostly that we just don't think about them when, when we do what we do. 

00:26:00
the mental health correlates of being poor • people living in poverty experience depression at higher rates than the rest of us (e.g., Blazer, Kessler, McGonagle, & Swartz, 1994; Brown & Moran, 1997; Bruce, Takeuchi, & Leaf, 1991; Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, Hulsizer, & Cameron, 1995; Siefert, Bowman, Heflin, Danziger, and Williams, 2000; Williams, Takeuchi, & Adair, 1992) • among the poor, some have even higher rates of depression than the rest: those who are homeless (Banyard & Grahm-Bermann, 1998) and those without enough to eat evidence the most distress (Heflin, Siefert, & Williams, 2005). 

00:26:05
PROFESSOR LAURA S. SMITH What you can find if you do a psycinfo search on poverty and mental health or poverty in psychology, what will be returned to you is study after study of, of things like this, documentation of sort of the terrible and myriad and wide ranging mental health and other kinds of poor outcomes that happen if you live in poverty. It turns out that poverty is... is bad for people in just about every way that you can think of with regard to your mental and physical health. I have just a few studies here listed for you with regard to depression. And... And researchers have also determined that among the poor, who tend to be more depressed, the rest of us, some are even more depressed those who are homeless and those who having, are without enough food for themselves or their families. 

00:27:00
status quo approaches to poverty • counting up the ways that poverty hurts • proposing and studying remediative services for families and children withstanding these effects • charity is something missing from this picture? 

00:27:05
PROFESSOR LAURA S. SMITH So, status quo approaches to poverty then tend to include the kind of literature that I just mentioned which sort of counsel up the way that poverty hurts people. There is also a certain amount of literature that sort of proposes different kinds of remediative services for people that live in poverty given that they are faced with so many obstacles, for example remedial services for school children in poor communities who we know don't have the same kinds of resources and teaching staff as other children, parenting skills, workshops for poor parents. And then another status quo approach to poverty is charity, different kinds of charitable outreach. You know, we can only be grateful when researchers turn their attention to poverty, if you care about poverty as an issue, you are happy for attention to be brought there. Also charity is vital for the survival in the short term, of families living in poverty. If people are without coats literally and it's winter then a coat drive is a vitally sort of important event in their lives. When people are without food, a soup kitchen is absolutely necessary to, to their survival. But... But there is something missing from that status quo approach. 

00:28:30
Blaming the Victim (Ryan, 1972) Status quo approaches allow the researcher to "concentrate his charitable interest on the defects of the victim, condemn the vague social and environmental stresses that produced the defect (some time ago) and ignore the continuing effect of victimizing social forces (right now). It is a brilliant ideology for justifying a perverse form of social action designed to change not society, as one might expect, but rather, society's victim" (p. 8). 

00:28:30
LAURA S. SMITH I am sort of parkening(ph) back now to a book that lots of people in here will be familiar with called "Blaming the Victim", from 1972 by William Ryan and here is this quote which I think begins to get it a little bit of why there is something unsatisfying about that status quo consideration of poverty. He talks about the fact that status quo approaches allow researchers to concentrate charitable interest on the defects of the victim to sort of condemn the social kinds of currents and forces that are resulting in those poor outcomes, but to do it in a way that allows him says Ryan back then, we would now say something that's gender biased I think that allows us to concentrate on those defects without talking about the bigger picture that produced them. So, Ryan isn't saying that status quo approaches don't recognize, for example that poor people are affected by social forces. That... That the fault of their suffering does not lie entirely within themselves. On the other hand, this is a way of talking about those problems and their remediation without talking about the social forces at all. 

00:29:55
"The causes of the causes" (Marmot, 2006) • ... or the social forces that create the life circumstances that create the symptoms. What are the policies, procedures, attitudes, and other mechanisms that keep poor people at such a disadvantage? And, from a structural perspective, how do we - as middle-class or owning-class people, as professionals, as researchers, as mental health practitioners, as caring observers, as well-intentioned helpers - play our parts in maintaining that system? • thinking about poverty from a different vantage point - a system-wide relational perspective 

00:30:00
LAURA S. SMITH Without talking about what Michael Marmot cause "The causes of the causes". The bigger picture. The... The system that is working through the function of those 10 variables that I talked about to produce certain kinds of outcomes for certain people, most of us in this room and certain kinds of other outcomes for other people, people living in poverty. And... And what's needed, says Marmot is a system-wide way. A different place to stand when we think about those issues, where we all see all of our lives as interrelated and not seeing the poor as a split off separate group that's in need of charity certainly, but beyond that is not really related to me in my life and, and, and the way that my profession functions. That's a relational perspective right, because I am now trying to think about poverty in terms of how its existence it relates to my own life. 

00:31:00
social exclusion • poor people are largely excluded from full participation in many mainstream social experiences: a consequences of poverty - or one of the defining features of poverty? • Bernice Lott (2002) and "distancing from the poor" • can we even imagine a class-inclusive society? • social exclusion in the laboratory: Jean Twenge, Roy Baumeister, and their colleagues 

00:31:05
LAURA S. SMITH One of the relational perspectives on poverty that isn't so common in American discourse but is discussed a lot in Europe and in other countries is the idea of social exclusion. The idea that as I mentioned before, four people are excluded from many main stream social experiences, even from public spaces in may ways, Heather Bullock is going to be doing a, a presentation today (inaudible ) in Santiago if you get a chance to go, on sort of how pushing the homeless out of parks and shopping malls and other places where everybody else to whom it ostensibly belongs, how that pushing out is, is a form of classism. Social exclusion relates to Bernice Lott's work in 2002, where she actually defined classism or, or one of its primary attributes as distancing from the poor as social and cognitive distancing from the poor. In a world where we didn't distance from the poor is something that probably many of us can't even imagine. Many of us in this room will take for granted that we don't live next-door to anybody who is poor. That we don't have as a close friend, a close friend somebody who is poor. The fact that poor people are kept on the outside looking in, in this way has been studied in the lot in the laboratory by Jean Twenge, Roy Baumeister and their colleagues. These are social psychologists. And they have a paradigm by which they give subjects sort of a, that going into too much detail. Some, some results or some feedback that they will be, that they can expect to be alone later in life, which, which sounds bad right. And they give other people different kinds of bad things to expect. For example, that they might be injured in some serious way. Some of their other participants in their study are not given any reason to believe that life holds something unpleasant for them. 

00:33:10
social exclusion is a unique source of harm social exclusion has been associated with: • aggressive behavior (Twenge, Baumeister, Tice, & Stucke, 2001) • high-risk, self-defeating decisions, procrastinating (Twenge, Catanese, & Baumeister, 2002) • giving up on frustrating tasks, increased consumption of unhealthy foods (Baumeister, DeWall, Ciarocco, & Twenge, 2005) • decrements in logic and reasoning (Baumeister, Twenge, & Nuss, 2002) • a distorted sense of time, avoidance of emotional language, and facing away from mirrors (Twenge, Catanese, & Baumeister (2003) 

00:33:10
LAURA S. SMITH And what they found is that when you lead people to believe that they are gonna be alone, they are gonna be excluded in life, it's associated with a whole bunch of like bad ways of performing on little laboratory tasks such as they found that they, that the people who were led to believe that they were gonna be alone later in life, gave up earlier on cognitive tasks and other laboratory tasks that were frustrating. They showed more aggressive behavior. They showed decrements in logic and reasoning. They seemed to have a distorted sense of time. They almost seemed to evidence said Jean Twenge, some kind of like inner numbness in a certain way, throughout the rest of the, the findings. Now certainly, this is an artificial scenario right, that you can't generalize sort of wholesale from laboratory findings to what it means to live a life on the outside. But poor people talk about suffering from their exclusion from the broader circles of human citizenship in ways they're really lined up with those laboratory findings.

"The inescapable impact of being born in a condition of poverty that this society finds shameful, contemptible, and somehow deserved, has had dominion over me to such an extent that I have spent my life trying to overcome or deny it... We were not noble, not grateful, or even hopeful. We knew ourselves despised." Dorothy Allison (1994) 

00:34:20
LAURA S. SMITH Can you see a quote by the Southern author Dorothy Allison, "We knew ourselves despised", she said and she has written evocatively of sort of how she has wrestled with, with the sort of the legacy of of growing up in extreme poverty. All the rest of her life, throughout all of her literary successes. 

00:34:35
practice begins with unpacking the meaning of help... True generosity consists in fighting to destroy the causes which nourish false charity. False charity constrains the fearful and subdued, the "rejects" of life to extend their trembling hands. True generosity lies in striving so that these hands - whether of individuals or entire peoples - need be extended less and less in supplication, so that more and more they become hands which work, and, working, transform the world. Paulo Freire, The Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1970, p. 29) 

00:34:40
LAURA S. SMITH Beginning to address social exclusion within our own practice means to start unpacking the meaning of what help means, not just help for the poor, but help for anybody. And I show a quote from Paulo Freire here. When he talks about the fact that helping somebody who lives in oppression, when you are a person with relative privilege is not an uncomplicated manner, it means that one needs to not only deliver the helpful thing, even though it may really be helpful and the person receiving it may really be grateful. It's... It... It... It means align yourself with the liberation, align yourself with justice for the people who are currently in need of your help, at the same time or instead of that. In, you know there is a very similar quote from Martin Luther King, who says almost exactly the same thing. Lots of you might know that, at the time that he was assassinated he was in the process of organizing his poor peoples campaign, and his thinking about what's help for the poor and really what's not helpful at all was very similar. 

00:35:50
...and moving beyond charity and sympathy • practitioners' inclination to deliver help via an attitude adjustment or skills training is understandable, given the thrust of the psychological research on poverty • what is the larger meaning and impact of interventions that constitute handouts - whether or coats, soup, or parenting skills? • what goes unaddressed in these transactions: an entire subtext regarding the hierarchical differences in our positions within the larger social system and has this transaction preserves them... 

00:35:55
LAURA S. SMITH You know, our inclination to see help for the poor as giving them some kind of new parenting skills workshop or some remedial training or some kind of supportive, you know intervention, is certainly understandable given the thrust of the research, which as I said typically portrays poverty in terms of the deficits and functioning that... that poor people can show. But what's the larger meaning of those handouts. Now, it's interesting or or at least let, let me know, that I'm not asking that question in the way it's usually asked. Usually you'll hear people say, what's the meaning of a handout and then, shortly thereafter you hear the quote about teaching a man to fish instead of giving him the fish. I don't mean what's the meaning in the lives of people receiving the fish. I mean what's the meaning for us. What is meaning of our preference to give something to people rather than to be allied with their liberation? Why would I rather work in a soup kitchen on Thanksgiving and then go home and feel good about myself than to ask myself why do so many people need soup in the richest country in the world? Because when a handout is given and this is all straight from various thinking, lots of you will recognize that I am sure. What goes unaddressed in those, those transactions is the subtext that describes my position (inaudible ) when I give it out. That is, I'm giving something that may be needed. The person in need of help is receiving something that may legitimately be needed. But what we're not talking about is why I am here and why you are here and why we are both gonna leave this room to face another day tomorrow where I am still here and you are still here and we're not talking about that. And why would I rather help you out in this way with a quote, than to talk about the larger system, you know those are much harder questions to answer. 

00:37:55
The limitations of charity • Charity leads me to avert my gaze from the structural elements and focus on the individual, the specific, and the concrete. • Charity gives me a way to separate myself from systems of oppression • Charity can be vitally helpful in the short term -- but it's the easy part of the work... 

00:38:00
PROFESSOR LAURA S. SMITH So charity the vital to people survival in the short, in the short term. In the long term, it can be part of a problem and that it leads me to avert my gaze from those big structural elements and, and leads me to focus my gaze on the thing that somebody needs in the moment. Oh, you need a coat, coat drive. Oh, there is not enough money for kids in the school in the Bronx to each have a computer. Oh it's about computers, computers are something that I can address. It's much easier to address than asking bigger questions. Um... charity also gives me a way to separate myself from those larger systems if I ever accidentally see them. If I ever notice out of the corner of my eye, that somebody, that, that, that sort of an unfairness of things. If I’m one of the people working in the soup kitchen on Thanksgiving, then I can sort of consider myself to be somewhat separate from them as unfortunate as they are. So, as important as it is, I think that charity is the easy part of the work. What's the hard part, "When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. 

00:39:15
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why people are poor, they call me a Communist. Dom Hélder Pessoa Câmara, Catholic archbishop of Recife, Brazil •Being part of change rather than charity requires us to go beyond the gratifying posture of the compassionate altruist •Why do so many people need coats? Why are we content to allow American school children in poor communities - out children - to go without the same teachers and computers and gym classes that other children have? Why does it take black-tie galas hosted by movie stars to bring the basics to our communities? 

00:39:15
PROFESSOR LAURA S. SMITH When I ask why the people are poor, they call me a communist." This quote coming from a Catholic archbishop from Brazil. Being part of change advocacy for socioeconomic justice. In addition to charity requires us to go beyond sort of the gratifying posture of the compassionate altruist. Um..., it requires us to ask those hard questions, why do so many people need coats? Why are we content to allow American school children in poor communities who are our children to go without the same kinds of computers and teachers and other kinds of resources that other kids have. Why do we have to have a big gala, a big black-tie affair where people go and have their picture taken to be published in the society pages of the newspapers before we can print those basic things to American communities. Even the poorest communities and the poorest big cities in this country like Detroit like New York, the high school graduation rates are 25% and 45% respectively. Why aren't their talent hose with people raising a ruckus about that. We are the rest of those kids. Um... we have not place for those kids in our legal economy of course. So we are making beds for them in our prisons. Why don't people have said about that. These are the kinds of questions that we have to, that there were sort of lead to when we kind of say okay, you know, beyond charity now. Let me, let me ask the questions about the system, which... which... requires to ask what kind of country we want to live in. Yes, all that does apply to our practice. Um... when we work within a traditional Paradigms, that is you are my client, I am your therapist, we are going to meet in a room for probably about 50 minutes. I am not gonna say very much. You are gonna say everything, I am gonna seem to have a lot more on the (inaudible ) than you because of that, because I am hardly saying anything and I seemed to have lots of smart interpretations, we're gonna do this, this week. I am gonna tell you time is up, I am going to see you again next week, of course that's a vast over simplification, but you see how a transaction takes place between us right. I kind of have more of an authoritative role in the room than you. I am the helper, you are the help seeker and we leave we depart that interaction without having any acknowledgement of that subtext. Um... that constitutes sort of an analog to phrase(ph) way of understanding um... the delivery of help, the... the... the... giving of help by privileged people to the oppressed. The application of it to psychological practice, I need to say is from someone who mentored me Jack Corazinni, Virginia Commonwealth University, ah, happy to be able to be pass along the smart ideas of my good teachers. Ah, and I think that you know already in counseling in psychology, there are lots of amazing practitioners who are looking for ways to subvert that power dynamic, that exist in conventional dyads. 

00:42:40
applications to psychological practice •In conventional dyads, existing structural dynamics remain unchallenged, resulting in "helpful" interactions that re-enact power-over dynamics between a relatively class-privileged therapist and a poor client •1) transformed psychotherapeutic practice, 2) co-created interventions, and 3)community praxis, to varying degrees, can challenge these dynamics by explicitly locating the work within a social, cultural, historical, and political context.... 

00:42:40
PROFESSOR LAURA S. SMITH Ah and I gonna think of them as falling on a continuum that... that... has those three points. It begins with transformed therapy... psychotherapeutic practice. 

00:42:50
• transformed psychotherapeutic practice: conforms closely to conventional models of psychotherapy, but important parameters of theory and technique have been modified in accord with feminist, multicultural, and/or social justice commitments •co-created therapeutic practices: developed collaboratively between professionals and community members; therapeutic interventions, but not psychotherapy •community praxis: partnership between community members and practitioners within a process of reflection and learning; all grow and all participate in 

00:42:50
PROFESSOR LAURA S. SMITH These are practices that look a lot like psychotherapy and then two people meet in a room but yet really different things are happening in a way that people relate to each other and the way that theory explains what's happening in the room. For example relational cultural therapy, which comes out of the Stone center in the work of Jean Baker Miller um... at Wellesley College. Then next on the continuum, in... in... in... in... order of increasing dissimilarity to, to traditional psychotherapy is co-created therapeutic practices. These are practices that emerge when we partner with community members to come up with a useful way for me to deploy my skills as a, as a psychologist that yet may be doesn't look like psychotherapy. But I created it together with a community member based on what they know about the needs of their community and what's appropriate and what works there. For example I have a colleague Debbie Chambers(ph) who worked with me in the CBO who came up with a group modality based on poetry and spoken word for a group of adolescence in East Harlem, with therapy happening, therapy small “t” in quotation marks, yes to me wasn't psychotherapy, wasn't group therapy, absolutely not very different. Yet it was a way of using our skills helpfully interculturally sort of you know appropriate way guided by the wisdom of community members. 

00:44:20
PROFESSOR LAURA S. SMITH Most similar to psychotherapy is what I am calling community praxis taking the word praxis from (inaudible ) These are ah, ah programmatic kinds of interventions that comprise the entire community in their operation. Um... you can find a great example of one of these um... in the excellent book by Aldarondo... Etiony Aldarondo who is speaking at this conference um... is called the road project and it was conducted by Lisa Goodwin and her colleagues in Boston. I also think the participatory action research constitutes a form of psycho valid, psycho... psycho politically valid practice at the community level. I'll be seeing more about, ah, this aspect of my presentation actually in an another even tomorrow where we are talking about reimagining psychological practice. 

00:45:15
Can you imagine it? Can mental health professionals re-envision their practice to include advocacy for economic justice and professional practice/actions such as these? Is this within the purview of psychologists, therapists, and counselors? (It's easy to assume that poverty, as regretful and sympathetic as we may feel about it, is a problem for someone else to solve...) 

00:45:20
PROFESSOR LAURA S. SMITH Can you even imagine those things though. Can you imagine going so far outside your office and outside traditional paradigms of what psychological practice is. Um... in order to work in this psycho politically valid way that being Isaac Prilleltensky's terminology and is it even our job, um... I think that it's too easy to assume that poverty is a job for politicians, for sociologists, for social workers, for people in other professions to address. Um... but I think we have a role that compliments theirs and I think our practice can be brought in alignment with our commitment to join with them in that work. 

00:46:00
beyond charity to change Aligning our work with the evolution of a more just society where all families have enough, toward a more democratic society where every person has a voice, and toward a more humane society where no one is kept on the outside looking in, is promoting mental health. (Smith, in press) 

00:46:05
PROFESSOR LAURA S. SMITH Um... and I think that advocating for economic justice and changing our practice to align with that work is mental health prevention. Um... it is about mental health, I don't see it as in other words adjunctive to or as a corollary to mental health work. I think that's part and parcel um... of mental health work. Of, of aligning our own practice in such a way that society is more adjust and everybody has enough, even if there is always have's and have not. I want to be able to look everybody in the eye and know that they have enough. That their kids have a decent school, that their community is safe, that they have health care. Um... moving towards a more democratic society where everybody has a voice even if it's inconvenient for me to listen to um... and moving towards a more humane society where we don't keep people on that outside looking in, which we know from the voices of the poor themselves, constitutes a unique source of suffering to them. Um... I would be happy to speak with any of you more about this, some around at the conference, ah... both days and I thank you so much for your attention today.
