DIAGNOSING MENTAL DISORDERS 

00:00:05
DSM-5® AND ICD-10 

00:00:10
NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS 

00:00:15
SEAN HARRIGAN The periods of our development from our conception through our adolescence are the most crucial of our lives. Well, these formative periods won't necessarily define the adults we will become, they will partially set the stage for a sense of identity or abilities and perhaps our limitations. For some however a number of complications during this time can interfere with the development of the nervous system, to the extent that it can impair the individual throughout their maturation and into adulthood. If this is the case, the individual may be experiencing a neurodevelopment disorder. A grouping of disorders codified and defined in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM-5®. These individuals could face significant difficulties with everything from educational development to motor skills. Difficulties they may face for their entire lives. 

00:01:15
DSM-5® AND ICD-10 CODING 

00:01:20
DSM-5® 

00:01:20
SEAN HARRIGAN The neurodevelopmental disorders groping in DSM-5® contains a number of distinct disorders, each given its own diagnostic code. The diagnostic codes correspond to those use by the World Health Organization in the International Classification of Diseases or ICD. In DSM-5® each disorder is first linked to the coding system from ICD-9 with the codes for (ICD 10) listed in parenthesis. Hence all of the DSM codes crosswalk to the ICD codes including the newest iteration ICD-10®. For example, Intellectual Disability, Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Mild is assigned the code 317 in ICD-9 and (F70.0) in ICD-10 listed in parenthesis. This is because the ICD-9 system was still in use when DSM-5® was first released. ICD-10® was released in the fall of 2015 in the United States. Although, it was adopted previously in other countries. However, because ICD-10® is now the standard in the United States this program will be listing the newer code from ICD-10 first, followed by the (ICD-9 codes) in parenthesis. Sometimes when relevant we will also delineate the ICD-9 and 10 codes, when we mention a disorder from another grouping of disorders. For example, Selective Mutism, a condition mentioned later in this program is coded as F94.0 (312.23) part of the grouping of anxiety disorders. Organizationally, there are few differences between the layouts of DSM-5® and ICD-10®. ICD-10® divides there equivalent neurodevelopmental disorders into three separate sections, F70-F79 Mental Retardation, F80-F89 Disorders of Psychological Development, and F90-F98 Behavioral and Emotional Disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence. Well, ICD-10® grouping a large number of disorders into smaller sections may seem like a minor organizational difference. It does help to illustrate the underlying characteristics among neurodevelopmental disorders. Some of which are also delineated by DSM-5's sub groupings. ICD-10's, F80-F89 section on disorders of Psychological development includes DSM-5's sections on Communication disorders, Autism Spectrum disorder, Specific Learning disorder and Motor disorders with the exception of Tic disorders, as well as the Intellectual Disability global developmental delay. This points to a few of the elements shared by all of these sub groupings of disorders. They began early in the developmental portion of the individual's life with onset before a child enters grade school. During this developmental period, there is some sort of impairment or delay in the maturation of the central nervous system. In this impairment or delay it leads to a steady course that does not involve the remissions and relapses that tend to be characteristic of many mental disorders. We look more at these features, as well as the more specific symptoms, of each subcategory and disorder throughout this program. ICD-10's, F90-F98 section on behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence includes the DSM-5® Neurodevelopmental disorders, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity disorder and Tic disorders. However, this section also includes disorders from numerous other sections of DSM-5®. All sharing the common trait of beginning in early childhood. These include disorders from Disruptive, Impulse Control and Conduct disorders, Anxiety disorders, Trauma-and Stressor-Related disorders, Feeding and Eating disorders, and Elimination disorders. 

00:05:35
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY 

00:05:35
(INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER) 

00:05:40
SEAN HARRIGAN Intellectual disability was known as Mental Retardation in DSM-4. A designation shared by ICD-10® though it is slated to be deemed Intellectual developmental disorder in ICD-11. This disability entails a diminish capacity in two primary interrelated areas, Intellect and what is known as Adaptive Functioning. The deficits in intellect can entail problems with learning, reasoning, abstract thinking, etc. A standardize individual test may be used to determine the individual's intelligence level. However, because of possible discrepancies in test results and their relative inability to determine adaptive functioning, clinical judgment should be used to determine the utility of these diagnostic results. Adaptive functioning entails an individual's ability to handle the demands of interacting within society, manifested in a number of domains. These domains are the conceptual, which includes academic skills, and understanding time, and money. Social which entails judgment in social situations, communication skills, the ability to form relationships, and the risk of being manipulated, and practical which includes self care, and house hold, and recreational skills, such as grocery shopping and meal preparation. The clinician can specify the current level of severity, be it mild, moderate, severe and profound. This will effect the ICD coding of the disorder, as each degree of severity is given its own designation and code. As oppose to an IQ test, the severity is determined by the patient's level of functioning in each of the domains of adaptive functioning. Mild intellectual disability may not become evident until the child is of school age when the individual begins lag behind the progress of their peers. These individuals may still be able to work independently in jobs that require lower intellectual skills. They tend to have difficulty with abstract thinking and needs some help in practical areas, such as shopping or managing money, though they can often achieve full capability of personal care. There may also be emotional and social immaturity. Individuals with moderate intellectual disability will experience a slower development in academic ability, communication, motor skills, and self-care. Even as adults, these individuals will lag behind their peers. Communication for example, is usually limited to less complex spoken language. These individuals may still have friendships and even romantic relationships though their limitations in social situations may make these more challenging. Employment may be possible if it involves less complex tasks and is done under supervision. Severe intellectual disability entails limited communication skills, perhaps, relegated to only single words or phrases. These individuals will need assistance in all facets of their life, from problem solving to self-care. They still may have close relationships with family and others. Individuals with profound intellectual disability will be extremely limited in their language ability, relegated mainly to non-verbal gestures. Their social interactions will typically be limited to family members, caretakers, and close others. With the exception of minor tasks, such as some basic chores, the individuals would be completely dependent on help from others. They can enjoy certain recreational activities like listening to music or going on walks. Profound intellectual disability can result for a neurological disorder which can lead to some sensory and motor impairment that may further limit the individual's conceptual, social, and practical functioning. For some less severe cases, intellectual disability may not be apparent until the child reaches school age. For most, it begins in early infancy or before birth. Causes before birth can include genetic factors, maternal disease and environmental factors, such as use of alcohol or other substances. Intellectual disability could also be caused by complications during labor or delivery, leading to abnormal neurological functioning or neonatal encephalopathy. Intellectual disability in infancy, childhood and adolescence can arise from infections, trauma, seizure disorders, cultural deprivation and poisonings or intoxication from substances such as lead among other causes. It can even arise from early-onset schizophrenia. Intellectual disability can be seen in conjunction with physical manifestations for individuals with genetic syndromes, such as with down syndrome. Males are more likely than females to experience intellectual disability. 

00:10:50
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY 

00:10:50
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS 

00:10:55
SEAN HARRIGAN Neurocognitive disorders are distinct from neurodevelopmental disorders and if they effect the ability to function on a cognitive level, involving deficits in memory, attention, language, perception, motor abilities and social cognition. The clinician should also consider Communication disorders, Specific Learning disorder and Autism Spectrum disorder in the differential diagnosis. We'll explore the diagnostic features of these disorders and how they differ from intellectual disorder later in the program. Furthermore, all of these disorders can coexist with intellectual disability. Individuals with intellectual disabilities are three to four times more likely than the general population to have certain comorbid conditions, such as other mental disorders or epilepsy. If a child under the age of five cannot be adequately assessed to determine the extinct of developmental deficits, Global Developmental Delay can be diagnosed. The way it will later need to reassessed. If an individual is over the age of five and cannot be accurately assessed because of additional disabilities, the clinician can diagnose Unspecified Intellectual Disability, Intellectual Developmental Disorder. 

00:12:10
COMMUNICATION DISORDERS 

00:12:15
SEAN HARRIGAN Though significant difficulties in communication may be a feature of certain disorders, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Disability. Some individuals may have disorders that only involve language, speech and communication. When these difficulties entail deficits in language, a diagnosis of language disorder may be appropriate. Language is defined as "The system of words or signs that people use to express thoughts and feelings to each other." This is contrasted against Speech, which is "The communication or expression of thoughts in spoken words." Other disorders in this section will entail deficits in speech. An individual with Language Disorder will have deficits in both vocabulary and grammar, starting early in the developmental period and causing them to lag behind their peers. This can occur across all iterations of language, be it spoken, written or even sign language. It affects the individual's ability to converse and communicate effectively, impairing them in multiple facets of their lives. Other conditions such as sensory impairment should first be ruled out in the differential diagnosis. Speech sound disorder can lead to similar social, academic and occupational impairments as language disorder. However, individuals with Speech Sound Disorder will have difficulty articulating the sounds required for speech. Individuals with this disorder may leave out or mix up sounds. Perhaps because they lack the knowledge of the sounds or have physical difficulties with the motor movements. Children with Speech Sound Disorder tend to respond well to treatment. And their abilities often improve as the children get older. However treatment becomes more challenging when Speech Sound Disorder is comorbid with language disorder. Child-Onset Fluency Disorder also known by the more familiar name of stuttering doesn't just refer to the repetition of words and sounds but also their elongation, the pauses in between or in the middle of them, and the substitution of difficult words for easier ones. This can lead to physical attention and anxiety for the child. As they may experience panic every time they need to speak, particularly in a more public forum. 80-90% of individuals with Child-Onset Fluency Disorder will begin experiencing symptoms before the age of six. If these symptoms arise later in life, it is diagnosed as Adult-Onset Fluency Disorder. Communication is defined as "The act or process of using words, sounds, signs or behaviors to express or exchange information or to express your ideas, thoughts, feelings, etc., to someone else." Individuals with Social Pragmatic Communication Disorder don't necessarily have difficulties with the structural use or vocabulary of language nor with the mechanisms of speech. But instead with using language and speech for the practical purposes of social communication. They will have difficulty adapting their use of language for particular situations based on the context or their audience. They also may not understand the conventions of conversation in a social context such as communicating verbal and nonverbal cues, or taking turns in speaking. And they may lack an understanding of subtext, metaphor, or even humor. There is a similar lack in communication with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Though Social Pragmatic Communication Disorder doesn't entail the Restrictive and Repetitive Behaviors of Autism. Therefore, if these restrictive and repetitive behaviors are present to a clinically significant extent, Autism Spectrum Disorder would be diagnosed instead of Social Communication Disorder. The clinician can also diagnose Unspecified Communication Disorder, when the individual doesn't meant the full requirements for one of the other communication disorders. 

00:16:25
AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER 

00:16:30
SEAN HARRIGAN Previous variations of Autism and related disorders such as Autism disorder, Asperger's disorder and childhood disintegrative disorder have now been brought together under the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in DSM-5®. Though they are still separated into several distinct disorders in ICD-10®. There are two primary categories of deficits to consider when diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder, Social Communication and Restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns. Unlike with many other disorders, when assessing the patient severity, the clinician will record a separate severity level for each of these two categories. Rather than the mild, moderate and severe specifiers assigned in many other disorders, the severity indicator of Autism Spectrum Disorder is classified as Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. At their simplest, these levels can partially be determined by the degree of support the individual needs. With Level 1 being the lowest, and Level 3 the highest, meaning a substantial amount of support. Level 1 for the social communication element of Autism Spectrum Disorder indicates the individual will find it challenging to begin social interactions and may have less interest to do so. However, unlike individuals with more severe Autism Spectrum Disorder, their language and speech is clear. And they will interact socially. It's only that these individuals may not interact in ways that are socially conventional. This can manifest in an inability with nonverbal communication such as with making eye contact or difficulty with reciprocal conversation. This may result in the individual finding it more challenging to build friendships or other non-familial relationships. An example of an individual with Level 1 for the social communication domain of Autism Spectrum Disorder is someone who speaks clearly and intelligently but may not intuitively pickup on the emotional undertones of others and may sometimes say socially inappropriate things. It is also worth noting that studies have shown that individuals with high functioning autism may have above average nonverbal intelligence. These deficits are more substantial in severity Level 2 of social communication with individuals less likely to begin social interactions and markedly less aware of social cues. These individuals may find it challenging to discuss topics outside of their immediate interest. Language use is also more limited and they will tend to speak in simpler sentences. Their nonverbal communication may be more odd or unusual, as they have difficulty in communicating via eye contact or body language and in understanding the nonverbal communication of others. Even with a support system in place these deficits will be pronounced. An example of a child with Level 2 severity for the social communication domain of Autism Spectrum Disorder is one who doesn't undertake imaginative play, has little understanding of the basis of humor and shows less interest in the needs of others but will still respond to some social interactions. Level 3 is the most severe form of Autism Spectrum Disorder. For the domain of social communication, the individual will rarely approach others and usually only then to fulfill their direct needs. When approached, their reciprocal response will be minimal or absent. Their language will be limited to only a few words. Nonverbal communication will be nearly nonexistent. An individual with Level 3 for the social communication domain of Autism Spectrum Disorder might never initiate conversations, will have a flat emotional affect and have few if any friends. The severity levels for the individuals restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns are based around a number of factors including the patients ability to function in various situations, their degree of inflexibility with these patterns and their amount of distress when facing change. Level 1 means there is impairment in one or more situations. This impairment happens in more situations with Level 2 and occurs across all context in Level 3 causing a highly significant amount of distress. These restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns entail various behaviors, interests and activities. This repetition could be evident in the individual's motor movements which can involve things like hand flapping or body rocking. It could also be apparent in their speech or interactions with objects. They can become strongly attached to certain objects or fixated on their own interests. They may also have a rigid approach to their routines and habits. These patterns could also involve the senses with either a fascination toward a particular stimulus or a strong dislike. In addition to severity, the clinician can indicate if the individual's Autism Spectrum Disorder is with or without accompanying intellectual impairment, with or without accompanying language impairment. Associated with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental factor with a particular condition indicated. Associated with another neurodevelopmental, mental or behavioral disorder with the disorder listed and with catatonia. These specifiers may require additional coding. Autism Spectrum Disorder is now diagnosed in around 1% of the worldwide population. Though it isn't known if this points to an increase in the incidents of Autism Spectrum Disorder or raised awareness of the disorder or from the expansion of diagnostic guidelines for the disorder. Symptoms are usually recognized during the second year of life, 12 to 24 months. But may possibly be seen before 12 months if developmental delays are severe. The majority of individuals with autism spectrum disorder will have a comorbid mental disorder with anxiety and depression being especially prevalent. Some patients report a decrease need or ability to sleep. Selective mutism and Stereotypic movement disorder should be considered in the differential diagnosis as should the previously mentioned communication disorders and intellectual disabilities. 

00:23:10
ATTENTION DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER 

00:23:15
SEAN HARRIGAN Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD is diagnosed when the patient fulfills the diagnostic characteristics for one or both of two categories of symptoms, those involving impairments in attention and those involving impairments in activity. Hence they name Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. In fact, the coding of the disorder is determined by which presentation of symptoms the individual displays. Combined presentation, Predominantly inattentive presentation and Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation. This will be determined by the incidence of symptoms within the previous 6-month period. Impaired attention occurs not only during times of work for the individual but also during times of play. This can effect their ability to listen, their attention to detail, their organizational skills and their propensity to complete tasks. This can lead the individual to make more mistakes in their work as they may have difficulty following instructions. They may also become easily distracted and not able to focus on tasks for long periods of time, causing notable impact to their functioning. Fidgeting, roaming, restlessness, and inappropriate running or climbing are all potential features of the Hyperactivity and impulsivity category of ADHD. The hyperactivity component of this category refers to the motor like quality of these individuals who may seem always on the move. Impulsivity is apparent in the individual's possible tendency toward instant gratification, and in their potential lack of precaution or discretion. Even in situations that ask for calm and stillness, these individuals will find it difficult to be inactive or quite. This may means that they are unable to take turns either in conversations or with activities. Regardless of what category of symptoms the individual displays, the symptom should be present in multiple situations or settings, impairing the individuals ability to function. It is estimated that 5% of children meet the diagnosis of ADHD with twice as many males as females. It can be difficult to assess ADHD in young children since the child symptoms can fall within the variance of normative behavior for the child's age. The disorder then becomes more evident with the structured environment of elementary school. There should be evidence of the disorder before the age of 12. ADHD can continue into adulthood with 2.5% of adults experiencing the disorder, or the individual may be able to still(ph) the external signs of hyperactivity, they still experience an inner restlessness and the impulsivity of ADHD can remain problematic. (inaudible ) mood and higher suicide risk are potential features associated with ADHD. There is a higher prevalence of anxiety and major depressive disorder for individuals with ADHD as compared to the general population. There is also greater likelihood of substance use and Intermittent Explosive Disorder among adults with ADHD. However, these conditions are not present for the majority of individuals with ADHD. About half of children with ADHD will also have Oppositional Defiant Disorder, one of DSM-5's Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders. Conduct Disorder is also comorbid with ADHD. There are many other disorders to consider in the differential diagnosis for ADHD. This includes Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Intermittent Explosive Disorder, other Neurodevelopmental Disorders, Anxiety Disorders, Depressive Disorders and Bipolar Disorders among several others. The clinician can specify the severity of the disorder by Mild, Moderate and Severe. They can also specify In partial remission, if the characteristics are no longer met for diagnosis but a degree of impairment still exists. If the patient doesn't meet the full diagnosis for ADHD, the clinician can diagnose other Specified Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or Unspecified Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Other when the clinician chooses to indicate why the patient didn't meet the full diagnosis and unspecified when they do not or when there is insufficient information to specify. 

00:27:55
SPECIFIC LEARNING DISORDER 

00:28:00
SEAN HARRIGAN Specific Learning Disorder can be found in 5-15% of children in their school years, and around 4% of adults. It entails biologically driven impairment, affecting the individual's ability to process information. These individuals will significantly lag behind their peers, revealed by low achievement and standardize testing or other similar individual administered measurements. Though the symptoms of the disorder typically become evident in elementary school, Specific Learning Disorder is lifelong, causing some individuals diminished academic achievement into adulthood. This can lead to an increased incidents of high school dropout among individuals with Specific Learning Disorder. Still the effects of Specific Learning Disorder into adulthood can vary based on such factors as the individuals environment, the severity of their disorder and their support systems to list a few. The exact nature of difficulties can also change with age. The individual's learning and academic difficulties can manifest in three distinct areas, Reading, Writing and Mathematics. Specific Learning Disorder with impairment in reading is more commonly known as Dyslexia and can involve difficulties with reading speed, comprehension or accuracy as well as spelling. This means, these individuals may read slower than their peers. Misinterpret the words that they read, have difficulty with comprehending the deeper context behind words, and have trouble spelling. Within each of the three academic categories for impairment, the clinician should specify the subtypes of impairment that the individual is experiencing. For reading, these are Word reading accuracy, Reading rate or fluency and Reading comprehension. Specific Learning Disorder with impairment in writing can manifest in the individual's grammar use, use of punctuation and spelling, as well as the organization and clarity of their writing. The Subtypes the clinician should specify for impairment in writing are spelling accuracy, grammar and punctuation accuracy, and clarity or organization of written expression. Specific Learning Disorder with impairment in mathematics can involve not only the individual's grasp of numbers and calculation but also their ability to apply mathematical concepts. The subtypes the clinician should specify for impairment in mathematics are number sense, memorization of arithmetic facts, accurate or fluent calculation and accurate math reasoning. Along with the other disorders and conditions that the clinician should consider in their differential diagnosis including intellectual disability, Neurocognitive disorders and ADHD, the clinician should also take into account the possibility that the individual's difficulties are due to normative academic challenges. These will be caused by external factors as oppose to innate factors in which the difficulties may instead be due to insufficient understanding of the language being used or inadequate education. 

00:31:25
MOTOR DISORDERS 

00:31:30
SEAN HARRIGAN Beginning in the early developmental period, an effecting as many as 6% of children from ages 5-11, Developmental Coordination Disorder entails the individual's motor skills lagging behind their developmental level to the extent that it causes impairment in multiple facets of their lives. These individuals may appear clumsy, their physical action slow or in precise(ph). In young children, this can mean that a late achievement of certain milestones, such as crawling, walking or speaking. Later in childhood and into adulthood, these deficits in motor skills can manifest in everything from performance in athletics to fine motor skills such as writing or drawing. Stereotypies are repetitive movements, done without any sort of social function. Stereotypic Movement Disorder entails individuals who seem driven to perform these behaviors. These behaviors which can include rocking, hand flapping, head banging and hitting or biting oneself can be normal in infancy and even early childhood. But when they continue later into childhood, they can cause significant difficulties in daily life. These behaviors can cause injury to the individual, in which case the clinician can specify with self-injurious behavior. They can also specify without self-injurious behavior. The clinician should also specify if Stereotypic Movement Disorder is associated with a known medical or genetic condition, neurodevelopmental disorder or environmental factor. Listing the associated condition disorder or factor and they should also specify the severity with mild, moderate or severe. 

00:33:20
TIC DISORDERS 

00:33:25
SEAN HARRIGAN A Tic is defined as a "Local and habitual spasmodic motion of particular muscles." In the case of Tic disorders, this can involve both movements and vocalizations. These Tic's can be characterized as Simple, meaning brief twitches, extensions or vocalizations or Complex, meaning longer movements or vocalizations. These complex tics could include sequential simple tics. Examples of simple motor tics might be grimacing the face, clenching the abdominal area or shrugging up the shoulders. Simple vocal tics could be coughing, inhalations or simple vocal syllables. There are numerous categories of complex tics. These include Copropraxia, which is inappropriate motion or gesture and Coprolalia, offensive language or utterances. There are similarity shared across all of the Tic disorders. They all involve the individual experiencing tics of at least one type, beginning before the age of 18. However, there are two factors that separate them from one another, the duration of the symptoms and the variety of tics. Tourette's Disorder entails both vocal and motor tics with multiple motor tics being necessary to assign the diagnosis. While, there are times when the symptoms will be more prevalent than others. They should've been present for over a year. The same year long durational component is shared by Persistent (Chronic), Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder. However, this disorder entails either vocal or motor tics but not both. The clinician should specify which. Provisional Tic Disorder can be solely motor tics, solely vocal tics or both in any amount. However, Provisional Tic Disorder is diagnosed when the individual has experienced the symptoms for less than a year. This diagnosis will be later changed if the symptoms continue beyond a year. The clinician can also diagnose other Specified Tic Disorder and Unspecified Tic Disorder with the same parameters that we've mentioned with the rest of the other and unspecified variations of disorders. And for neurodevelopmental disorders as a whole, the clinician can also diagnose other specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder and Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder. Even though many of these disorders maybe a lifelong conditions. For some, early diagnosis can improve outcome. For others diagnosis may offer the chance for the individual to be referred to the appropriate provider who can then find the right mode of treatment. Ultimately, correctly diagnosing these disorders is often the first step in the treatment process. One that can help the patient effectively manage their disorder and improve their quality of life.
