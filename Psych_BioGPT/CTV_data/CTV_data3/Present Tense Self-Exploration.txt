Introducing a Client to Present Tense, Self-Exploration James F.T. Bugental, Ph.D. 

00:01:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL The privacy of the clinical situation is purely hypothetical. Here, the clinical situation for clinical demonstration, what do we have? Five hundred people? And that seems almost ludicrous when we name it a clinical situation. But you go back to your office that you, you're the only who uses, and then I think, you think I think, now we really have privacy. And yet in a way even then, we can't have full privacy. I walk out and my two associates, one of whom has disappeared already uh, Myrtle and Molly, uh,- 

00:01:55
UNKNOWN I'm here. 

00:01:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Oh, there she is. Have uh, we talk about how'd it go, so the privacy has been broken open a bit. But even if I go directly from my private office to my private home, and Elizabeth says, "how'd it go?" Well, I don't tell her, oh boy you should have heard what Beverly told me. But, she looks at my face. She looks at the way my body is carried and so on, and she says, rough day, huh? What I'm trying to say by exaggeration is that privacy, essential as it is, is always in some measure a myth. We, we break that, break out of the prison cell of total privacy and are, in order to do our work. So, to demonstrate something of that process here, we have all of us together to share the privacy of this clinical situation. Why all the emphasis on privacy? Why all the emphasis on seclusion? Well, it's one end of a dimension, I think, which runs from total openness, to only within myself, the individual's experience. And it's part of what I think of as the present-tense emphasis I think is so important. Some of you are with me the other day when we talked about that. Life is always present-tense. What I had, what I did yesterday is past, is not alive. what I talked with my friends about at breakfast is not alive. Only in this instant of my speaking to you is it alive. That may seem like we're pressing uhm, a manifest, an obvious point, to kind of an extreme, and yet I want to assure you as psychotherapists, we need to remind ourselves again and again that life is always now and life is only now. What we said last week, yesterday, this morning at breakfast, as we got settled in our chairs here, is all past. It's object. The only true subjective experience is now. And now. And now. Once we get a hold of that notion, or let it get a hold of us, once that happens, we begin to see how important as we listen to a client is the now. And I try to say it like it was all in capital letters with an exclamation point after it, NOW! What the client tells me about himself, herself whether it's about when they were children, either when a child. Or when it's about last week, or whether it's about this morning at breakfast, or whether it was about when you came into the office five minutes ago, it's all objective. It's all impersonal, no longer alive. I believe very strongly that psychotherapy, to be most effective, needs to be living, alive, in the moment. So as we work together, wait a minute, I've got something alive right now. 

00:06:35
[sil.] 

00:06:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL That as we work together, my client and I, we are continually moving in and out of the true subjective of the alive and the past, the historic, if you will. What happened as I sat over here at the table, is history. I can't do a thing about it. If I, if I said the wrong thing; if I got mixed up, that's history. It's fact. It's objectified. Only can then I do something about right now as I speak to you. I can plan as I pause from the end of this sentence I'll talk about so and so, but I may or I may not. I'm emphasizing what seems a, such an obvious point. And yet, so much of our work is conducted as though we had somehow access to the past or the future, that we could talk about that with the same sense of factualness that we talk about now. And that's not so. We subtitled today's session Introducing a Client to Present Tense Self-Exploration. Present tense self exploration. In a few minutes, I want to work with someone to try to illustrate the importance and the methods of working in the present tense. Have you-found someone? 

00:08:35
UNKNOWN No, you need to announce it. 

00:08:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Okay. If, if you would be willing to be worked with. That's an odd expression, isn't it? Okay, if you'd be willing to be worked with, Dr. Molly Sterling and Dr. Myrtle Heery will talk to you over here as I go on in a new now here. And help us find, of course we want the ones who'll be most dramatic and interesting. But, uhm, but they will try to find ones that will be helpful to our purpose, since we have a very short time. Once reason that it's good to have a longer time as we start a relation with a client is to get some in-depth notion of their nows. So if you would come and talk uh, it's happening. Now, it's happening. 

00:09:40
[sil.] 

00:09:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL The true subjective, that which is truly subjective, is the site of the most effective psychotherapy. It helps sometimes to get access to the true subjective to find out about what was true. We take a history. We encourage the client to voice his/her complaint. But we're not doing therapy as I like to think of it, when we're doing those things. We're getting ready for,- it's, it's the equivalent of what's happening over here right now. It's not psychotherapy yet when we're getting information about, that word about is such a, it gives the whole thing away. When we get the immediate experience expressed as best it can be, then we have access to the therapeutic. The true subjective is always present tense. The objective is sort of like the clothes we wear. We're all clothed here, even I understand in the hot tub on the second floor, or on the fifth floor, you wear clothes. Okay,- 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN I'm going to take them over. 

00:11:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Good. Why do we wear clothes? You know, think about it for a minute. It can be a hundred degrees outside this building, and yet, we don't go out naked, mores a pity. But, but the clothing covers more than the physical body, doesn't it? It, it's a way of controlling how much I expose. And we do this same thing with objectivity of speech. We control the psychological body, if you will, and everything we remove from that, from that coverage, the more naked our speech, what we're talking about, the closer we are to doing psychotherapy where the psyche dwells. 

00:12:25
[sil.] 

00:12:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL In so many ways, we learn to try to control what we show to the world and one of the ways is to objectify. And we objectify by talking about than out of. As I talk to this young lady who's consented to work with us, what she will tell us will be interesting and useful, but more important is how she will tell it. Myrtle? Will you, will you introduce me to, this-, 

00:13:25
[sil.] 

00:14:05
UNKNOWN They're all plugged up. This is the milennium folks. 

00:14:15
[sil.] 

00:14:40
UNKNOWN It's still in front of his- 

00:14:45
[sil.] 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN They're taking off. 

00:14:50
[sil.] 

00:15:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL You know, it would be less instrusive if I just held it. 

00:15:25
[sil.] 

00:15:35
UNKNOWN Kathy, you come do it. 

00:15:40
UNKNOWN Is that it? 

00:15:40
UNKNOWN You've got it around the- 

00:15:40
GILDA Oh, oh, I didn't know it was on. 

00:15:45
UNKNOWN Is that it? 

00:15:45
UNKNOWN Talk. 

00:15:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Talk. I'm talking. 

00:15:50
[sil.] 

00:15:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Okay, we in? This... something's... Hi Gilda. 

00:16:05
GILDA Hi. 

00:16:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Let's take a minute and just go in, each of us and then, as you come up and out, look out and these are pretty friendly people, I think, as far as I can tell. And uh, and then we can talk to the other (inaudible )okay? 

00:16:28
GILDA Okay. 

00:16:30
[sil.] 

00:16:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Okay? 

00:16:50
GILDA All right. 

00:16:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I know. 

00:16:55
GILDA Well, I just graduated on Sunday with my masters and I'm going through a lot of things right now. I'm going through a divorce and I'm moving to a new location. I'm moving from Chicago to Kansas City. And, just probably having uhm, a lot of guilt about the divorce, I think. 

00:17:20
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I think divorces are notorious for sowing guilt. 

00:17:30
GILDA Yeah, I think you're right. 

00:17:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL How are you handling it? 

00:17:35
[sil.] 

00:17:40
GILDA I think okay. I just, it's the guilt, I think, of hurting someone. 

00:17:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I noticed you think first of guilt, uh, and whether it's okay or not. And I wonder how you're handling inside. That, that's the hard part about guilt of that kind. 

00:18:05
GILDA Yeah, I think you're right. 

00:18:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Take your time. Just- 

00:18:10
GILDA How am I handling it? 

00:18:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah, what are you doing for Gilda inside about this trauma of the divorce and move, and all that's going on? 

00:18:20
GILDA I'm probably avoiding it. Probably avoiding thinking about it. 

00:18:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Twice you called it probably, and I wonder why, what that means? 

00:18:35
[sil.] 

00:18:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Take your time. 

00:18:45
GILDA I am avoiding it. 

00:18:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL How do you do that? 

00:18:55
GILDA How do I do that? Stay busy. 

00:19:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Stay busy. Uh huh. Yeah. I notice when you started to answer you took a big breath. I know how that feels in here. 

00:19:20
[sil.] 

00:19:25
GILDA Pain. It's pain. 

00:19:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL It's pain, yeah. Have you gotten acquainted with your pain? 

00:19:40
GILDA I'm not sure what you mean. Do I understand it? 

00:19:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Well, so, pardon me? 

00:19:45
GILDA Do I understand it? 

00:19:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I don't know. That might be a way. Mostly we try to push away or shut off or turn away from pain. And yet, often, if we can listen to it, it opens things up. 

00:20:05
GILDA Admitting it hurts. 

00:20:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL That's certainly part of it, yeah. 

00:20:15
[sil.] 

00:20:15
GILDA And it,- 

00:20:20
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I'm sorry? 

00:20:20
GILDA I guess admitting that it hurts and that I know in my heart that it's uh, that I'll work through it, and then it will feel better. 

00:20:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Your jaw's very tight there. 

00:20:35
GILDA Pardon? 

00:20:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Your jaw got very tight. It amuses you a little bit. it's all right, yeah. 

00:20:50
GILDA Yes, you're right. Uhm, I think I feel, not I think, I know, that I feel real tense all over. 

00:21:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL What do you do with that tension? How do you deal with it? 

00:21:10
GILDA Do things. 

00:21:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL What, I'm sorry? 

00:21:10
GILDA Do things to keep busy. 

00:21:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Do things. Keep busy, yeah. That really helps sometimes. And when the things to do are done, there it is waiting for us, that pain, or whatever goes with it. 

00:21:30
GILDA I think by that time, I've done so much, that then I just go to sleep. I keep very late hours. 

00:21:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL So sleep is a refuge in a way. 

00:21:40
GILDA Right. 

00:21:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah. Yeah, a good one. 

00:21:45
GILDA That's good? 

00:21:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Mmh hmm, because it helps to renew us. 

00:21:50
GILDA Okay. 

00:21:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL It's interesting that that surprised you to think of it as a good one, and yet I don't think you'd hestitate to say exhaustion is not a good one. 

00:22:05
GILDA Um. You're right, I didn't, you're right, I didn't think about that. I didn't think of it as a refuge. I thought of it as a necessity. 

00:22:20
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I'm sorry? 

00:22:20
GILDA I thought of it as a necessity. I didn't think of it as a refuge. 

00:22:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Mmh hmm. Does it elicit anything inside of you when you think of it as a refuge? 

00:22:35
[sil.] 

00:22:35
GILDA Yeah, yes it does. I think about a refuge as being a safe place uhm, like on an island or relaxing, that type of thing. 

00:22:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Boy your face lights up now. That's-, yeah, I see another part of Gilda. Yeah. Slowly. Something's happening. Go slow. Just tell me whatever's there. 

00:23:05
[sil.] 

00:23:05
GILDA I think the hard part of divorce is blaming yourself that you could have done something or changed things or something. 

00:23:20
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Are you a blamer of yourself? 

00:23:20
GILDA Yes. 

00:23:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Mmh hmm. That does make it harder. 

00:23:25
GILDA I do blame, you know, I, I try to look at my role, what my role was in the relationship, and did I play the, do the part that I should have or maybe I could have done things differently. 

00:23:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Maybe, you say. 

00:23:50
[sil.] 

00:23:55
GILDA I'm not sure. 

00:24:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL No. 

00:24:00
GILDA At the time I thought I was doing the best that I could. 

00:24:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL So is this Gilda today, it's more judgmental than earlier I hear. 

00:24:15
GILDA Yes. 

00:24:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Oh boy, there was guts in that yes. 

00:24:20
GILDA I could see the truth in that. You're right. 

00:24:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I'm going to bring us to a pause here. I don't want to push you into further things, but is there anything you'd like to say before we pause? Anything at all? 

00:24:40
GILDA I don't think, no. I'm okay. 

00:24:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I'm sorry? 

00:24:45
GILDA No, I'm fine. 

00:24:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Oh, I don't doubt that. Yeah. Okay, thank you for coming up and going through this with me. And Molly or Myrtle will probably talk to you a little bit now. 

00:25:05
GILDA Thank you. 

00:25:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Good. Thank you. 

00:25:05
GILDA Thank you. 

00:25:10
[sil.] 

00:25:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Before we move on, uh, I will do another demonstration in a little bit because each person is so different. But I'd, I'd like if you have any pressing questions that you'd like to ask about what we've just done, now's the time to press them forward. 

00:25:45
UNKNOWN She's coming Jim. 

00:25:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Pardon? Yeah in a minute. Just have a chair right there. I don't, will you look? I can't see if people are indicating that... 

00:26:00
UNKNOWN If they're indicating that they want to ask a question? 

00:26:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah. 

00:26:05
UNKNOWN If you want to ask a question, there should be a mike in the middle. There's someone standing, go ahead. 

00:26:15
UNKNOWN I, I noticed uhm, a pattern of when the client brought forth some new emotional material, that the very first acknowledgement or paraphrasing was much dryer, that was then followed up with several follow up questions, that were much more warm and eliciting, and I was wondering if that was something you did consciously or on purpose? 

00:26:40
[sil.] 

00:26:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL As far as I know, I remained conscious. 

00:26:50
[sil.] 

00:26:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL But I understand the meaning of your question. I can't see you, uhm, but when you think of that and say consciously, you're, you're implying by some strategic basis, that I have some strategy in mind? 

00:27:10
UNKNOWN Right, yeah, I was curious if the contrast was part of how you work? I've not had the opportunity to see you before. The contrast between a quick acknowledgement that was less emotional but then a pause and a few seconds later going with something that was much more eliciting. 

00:27:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL It's, I don't think it's a conscious strategy, but when you describe it that sounds pretty close to my general intent, to start open and find some place in there where I feel we can go in to more concrete or specific things. Uhm, is that the essence of your....? 

00:27:50
UNKNOWN Yes, thank you. 

00:27:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Thank you. I think that- 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN Is there anyone who'd like to speak, ask a question? You can go to the microphone if you'd like to. Otherwise, we'll move on to the next interview. 

00:28:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah, let's-, I don't think there's anyone there. 

00:28:05
UNKNOWN There's no one there. 

00:28:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Okay. 

00:28:10
[sil.] 

00:28:20
UNKNOWN Are you having trouble hearing? Okay. The microphone man, we're having trouble hearing, can you turn the mike up? 

00:28:25
[sil.] 

00:28:25
UNKNOWN Steven, this is Dr. Bugental. 

00:28:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL And you are? 

00:28:30
STEVEN Steven. 

00:28:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Steven? 

00:28:30
UNKNOWN Is the microphone man around to help with the sound? 

00:28:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Oh, now we play the microphone game. 

00:28:35
UNKNOWN We've got the microphone game. 

00:28:40
[sil.] 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:28:47
UNKNOWN Okay. This one? 

00:28:55
[sil.] 

00:28:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I think in the future we should be fitted with microphones at birth, you know? It'd save a lot of time and trouble. 

00:29:10
UNKNOWN Could you test it? 

00:29:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Say hello. 

00:29:10
STEVEN Hi. 

00:29:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Hi. 

00:29:15
UNKNOWN Can you hear? 

00:29:15
STEVEN Can I hear? 

00:29:20
UNKNOWN Can you hear? 

00:29:20
UNKNOWN There's no amplification. 

00:29:20
UNKNOWN Myrtle, she's not on. 

00:29:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, I think he's going to turn it on. Say something. 

00:29:25
STEVEN Hello? 

00:29:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Now we've put you on. 

00:29:35
STEVEN Okay. 

00:29:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Tell me a little bit about, who are you? 

00:29:35
STEVEN Uh, my name is Steven. And uhm, I'm a mother and a wife, and hopefully soon to be a licensed marriage and family therapist. And I used to be an engineer. 

00:29:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I'm sorry? 

00:29:55
STEVEN In the past I was an engineer, so this a career change for me. 

00:29:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL In the past you were ... 

00:29:55
STEVEN An engineer. 

00:30:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL An engineer. On a railroad, or on a...? 

00:30:05
[sil.] 

00:30:10
STEVEN That would have been a lot more fun. 

00:30:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL You ever wish when you were a kid that you could be? 

00:30:15
STEVEN Uh, on a railroad? As that kind of enginner? Oh yes! Pulling that toot toot! That would have worked. 

00:30:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Right. What caused the big change? 

00:30:30
STEVEN Uhm, corporate America. It was too hard being uh, a woman in engineering as I progressed to middle management. And it was even harder being a black woman as I advanced up the ladder of corporate America. And the cost was not worth the payoff. It just wasn't, so I left it. 

00:30:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL What, what was your inner process of making such a big decision and then choosing a new path? 

00:31:00
STEVEN Oh, my inner process? Uhm, there was anger. Resentment. Uhm, sadness, deep sadness that something I wanted so much and had worked for so much didn't become or feel like I expected it to feel. Disappointment. 

00:31:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Of course. 

00:31:25
STEVEN Very much disappointment. Pain. 

00:31:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Pardon? 

00:31:30
STEVEN Pain. 

00:31:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Pain. Right. And a little bit shows in your face right now. 

00:31:40
STEVEN Yeah, it's, it's, pain. 

00:31:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Steven, you, you kind of laugh at that, and I think the situation makes for a certain self-consciousness. I understand that. But I'm wondering if there's something more. Could you tell me? 

00:32:00
STEVEN Uhm, it's a defense against sadness. Uhm, bringing it from feeling painful to laughing it off. 

00:32:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Does it work? 

00:32:10
STEVEN It is now. 

00:32:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL All right. Well. Yeah, don't knock it. 

00:32:25
STEVEN Yeah. 

00:32:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Right. 

00:32:25
STEVEN It didn't work then. 

00:32:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL And now, what does it leave? Where the laughter was, what's there now 

00:32:35
STEVEN Uh, what's, what's, what's there now is uh, pride. 

00:32:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Pride? 

00:32:40
STEVEN Pride. Pride that I had the courage to give it up. Give up something that meant a lot and still feel whole. 

00:32:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL As you talk, your whole body moves. It's, it's not just an up here thing. It seems like you move and wiggle. 

00:33:05
STEVEN Okay. 

00:33:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I don't mean to make you self-conscious, but I think that expresses something going on inside of you. 

00:33:10
STEVEN Okay. 

00:33:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Can you get a sense of what that might be? 

00:33:20
STEVEN Uh, excitement? 

00:33:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Excitement? Uh huh. 

00:33:25
STEVEN Enthusiasm. 

00:33:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Enthusiasm. 

00:33:30
STEVEN I really feel good. Uh, because it was scary, and I did it. 

00:33:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL And you did it, yeah. All right. 

00:33:40
STEVEN Yeah, so I guess my body shows well. 

00:33:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah, it does. 

00:33:45
STEVEN I did it. 

00:33:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Isn't that neat? 

00:33:45
STEVEN Yeah. Oh God. 

00:33:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Huh? 

00:33:50
STEVEN It's just amazing. It's interesting. 

00:33:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL It amazes you? 

00:33:55
STEVEN Right, that you see it, that that's what my body is telling you. And that's what's connected to it. 

00:34:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Can you follow in on that? That amazement and those feelings that you just now discovered? Do they take you any place now? 

00:34:15
STEVEN Humility. 

00:34:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Humility? 

00:34:15
STEVEN Yeah. 

00:34:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL That's interesting. 

00:34:20
STEVEN Yeah. 

00:34:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL And you nod and sort of with a downcast eye. 

00:34:30
STEVEN Yeah. 

00:34:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Don't go anyplace you don't want to, but can you tell me anything about what came with that nod? 

00:34:40
STEVEN Uhm, just how surprising it is that something that I feel so proud of, that you would see just in the way I answered that when I own it in front of people uhm, I want to humble myself instead and not show it. It feels almost like I'm being boastful or- 

00:35:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Uh huh. 

00:35:10
STEVEN And I don't want to be that. 

00:35:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL And you don't want to be boastful. 

00:35:10
STEVEN No. 

00:35:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL No. But, something inside of you is kind of glad you are that way. Isn't that so? 

00:35:25
STEVEN It's true. 

00:35:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL It's true. Yeah. 

00:35:30
STEVEN It's true. 

00:35:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Now take just a minute to find-, we've been stirring things up in there. 

00:35:35
STEVEN Yeah. 

00:35:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Can you just take a minute and kind of see what's bubbling to the surface? 

00:35:45
[sil.] 

00:36:05
STEVEN Just to wonder why I'd hold back something that feels that good and mask it with you must be humble. 

00:36:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL What? 

00:36:15
STEVEN You must be humble. And not really just go ahead and let it- 

00:36:20
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Let it go. 

00:36:25
STEVEN Just let it be there. 

00:36:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Right. You've worked for it. 

00:36:30
STEVEN Right. So it's, confusing. 

00:36:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Hmm? 

00:36:35
STEVEN It's confusing that I would do that. 

00:36:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah, but that's the way we're taught isn't it? 

00:36:40
STEVEN Yes. Very much so. 

00:36:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Very much so. 

00:36:45
STEVEN That is how I was reared. 

00:36:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL We're working on a terrible time schedule, so I want you to have a chance to give me any feedback you'd like to before we stop. 

00:37:00
STEVEN You're good. 

00:37:05
[sil.] 

00:37:05
STEVEN You're good. Thank you. 

00:37:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Thank you. 

00:37:15
[sil.] 

00:37:20
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I'm going to move over there and get rid of that contraption. 

00:37:30
[sil.] 

00:37:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL What did I do with my cane? 

00:37:35
UNKNOWN I'm your cane. Come on. 

00:37:40
[sil.] 

00:37:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah, thank you. 

00:37:45
[sil.] 

00:37:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Well, I think we've got time for two or three questions. I want to make just a few summarizing-, am I coming through? 

00:37:55
UNKNOWN No. 

00:37:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL No. Okay. Yeah, that's all right. I'll just stand here. I want to make a few summarizing points and then I'll be glad to respond to questions. First of all, I tried to illustrate the power of staying in the present tense. Not going into history, how come, uh, why did you change professions? Uh, what did you think about engineering, you know. A lot of interesting points, and I suspect if we went into therapy, many of which would come to the surface at some point. But they'd come to the surface of their own the word that comes to mind is yeast, of what was in them, not because I would pull them out. Is that distinction clear? 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:38:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah. I think it's radically different when the client expresses feelings, ideas even, uh, whatever, out of immediate experiencing, or if they come in response to my questions, or a formal case history or something like that. I think the work moves more readily to important fo-, foci. Foci? F-O-C-I?, No, focuses. To important focuses of, of inquiry and exploration. And to be sure, I'm not interested particularly in working out issues, but in empowering the client to confront his/her own issues with a feeling of support, with a feeling of uhm, personal involvement. This is my issue, not something about me, but this, I'm fighting with this issue. I'm working with this issue right at this moment. Sometimes the products of that are very similar to when we took formal histories and and found focuses, I'm determined with that word, uh, found a place to focus our energies. And sometimes it's radically different. Part of this point of what I'm trying to say is that I believe history is more a curiousity than a therapeutic agency when it's dealt with just for itself, as history. When history is evoked by confrontation with one's own inner experiencing, then it can be part of the therapeutic program. The subjective is always unknown. You're subjective right now as you listen to mine as I speak is unknown in some measure. Not totally, but I don't know for sure what the next sentence is going to be. And I certainly don't know what are the feelings and thoughts that will be evoked as I reflect on our time together this morning. We're always living in a measure of mystery. Isn't that great? No, it really is. It's great. It means possibility surrounds us always. Part of the job of the therapist, my job as a therapist sometimes, is to help people discover their mystery and to feel empowered to go into it and explore it and see where it takes them. We speak, well, you've certainly had this experience of speaking or writing and suddenly finding yourself with thoughts or ideas or images that, where did they come from? There is a deep reservoir within each of us of latent or potential ideas, images, thoughts, relationships. Not just one. Not just the one that my mother and my father evoked in me. But all their various progeny, if you will, as fertilized by 80 years of various kinds of experiences. I know that when Freud taught us how much our early years influence the way we are today, that was a great breakthrough, an important one. It made causality available instead of being speculative. But now it's time to go further, to come to the living moment. To deal with the inner struggle, to express it, to empower it. In order to do that, I feel that the therapist's job is to teach the client the difference between verbalization and experiencing. We come too often, I find in my own work even, even though I teach this. Too often I find I'm following up the verbal, logical, explicit rather than listening for and finding what's more implicit and sometimes logical, but by it's own logic, not by the public logic, so to speak. Well, there's so much more I might say, but I think I'm going to pause here in order to have time for some questions. 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN There are people lined up at the microphone for the questions. 

00:44:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Oh! Oh, I was looking over here. 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN They're right there. 

00:44:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Okay, first question please. 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN Well, it seems to me that there's a lot of choices for the therapist after the client has gone on speaking for a while and you sort of choose where to focus to pick up your word. And I was wondering if you have uhm, something to tell us about, a guideline for where you choose to focus? For example, is it just based on is it always inconsistency between what they're saying and what their body is doing? 

00:44:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Always based on what? 

00:44:55
UNKNOWN Well,- 

00:44:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I didn't get the word you said. 

00:44:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, the choices that I could understand are like inconsistencies between what their body is doing and what they're saying or do you have a hierarchy of feelings in your mind that some, you know, you always go for the deeper ones? Some are more important than others? Do you, do you base it on your hunch about what's going on and kind of lead them in that direction, or how do you choose which way to go? 

00:45:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Uh, hunch. 

00:45:20
UNKNOWN Well, how-, hunch based on-, hunch based on your guess of what's really going on with them in other words? 

00:45:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah, uh, and I'm picking up a lot of nonverbal cues usually, changes in voice, position, face, uhm, change of subject. Anything that tells me, signals something's going on. 

00:45:45
UNKNOWN Oh, okay. 

00:45:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL In however I, I, note that then that's a good place to follow in. 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:45:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Surely. Thanks for your question. Yes, please. 

00:46:00
UNKNOWN Referring to the first demonstration, uhm, somehow I was aware that when uh, you were reflecting on the words, such as probably, I guess-, 

00:46:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL A little bit louder. I didn't get all that. 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN When the, she was uh, preceding her emotional state description by I guess or probably. Uh, I wonder these are key words or it's just keeping consistent with wanting to hear what they are feeling? 

00:46:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah, well, when one uses those it's sort of like crossing your fingers, you know? This isn't quite the real thing, but it's pretty close. And so I always want, I'm curious how come it's not the real thing. Why is it probably or maybe or something like that? My clients have gotten very annoyed with me at times. I can't say anything? You know? You're always finding fault with the way I talk. No, well, that gives us something more to work with. Yes, next question. 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN With the first client, you talked about past, present and future-, 

00:47:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Say that again, I'm sorry. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN You talked about being in the present with the first client? And then, at the very end, you made the observation that the guilt was a judgement about something that happened in the past? And uhm, I think I know what you were saying, but I'm not real clear, I mean, was that trying to help her see that she's no longer in the present? I'd just like for you to say just a little bit more about that observation. 

00:47:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Wow, I'm sorry, I just don't recall enough to-, I'm also kind of present tense in my ears, and uh, and I simply don't remember that. 

00:47:55
MOLLY I do. Can I, can I make a comment Jim? 

00:48:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL All right. 

00:48:00
MOLLY This is Molly, over here. 

00:48:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Where are you? 

00:48:00
MOLLY Behind you. 

00:48:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Oh, there! You have a (inaudible ) 

00:48:11
MOLLY I have a comment on that moment. 

00:48:11
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Here's a comment. 

00:48:15
MOLLY I, I think what was happening is that he recognized and tried to help her recognize that her actual experience of the past had been changed into the present, in the present, into guilt. It hadn't been guilt in the-, it hadn't been a sense of doing wrong in the past. She'd done the best she could. 

00:48:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Thanks, Molly. Yeah, that's right. And what, what often happens is after uh, a session or series of sessions with someone, I've forgotten a lot of the detail like that. And my clients are sometimes quite annoyed with me. I have to keep telling you the same thing. Don't you pay attention? And then I try to say, no I don't pay a lot of attention to the what. I'm listening to the how. And uh, that annoys them sometimes, and sometimes they're intrigued, and then we work with that. That's the, that's the uh, key. Whatever happens is the work. There's no way they can't do the work, and that's a surprise to some clients. But there's no way they can avoid doing the work. They can cuss me out and throw the chair around the room or sit down and cry, but that's the work. And that's keeping it alive. And once the client begins to realize that they are empowered to do a lot of work on their own, because they're always there, even though often they put themselves away. What? 

00:50:10
UNKNOWN Five minutes. 

00:50:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I got five minutes. Okay. 

00:50:10
UNKNOWN And you've got five people up at the microphone. 

00:50:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL One minute each. Go ahead. 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN With the last client, you made the observation that she was wiggling, and- 

00:50:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL That she was what? 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN She was wiggling, moving her body. 

00:50:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Wiggling, oh yeah. Okay. 

00:50:30
UNKNOWN And uhm, you made it in such a way that she was very open to uh, responding. You, you notice lots of things. But it seems to me you comment on them in a way that is so non-judgemental uh, that the person is able to respond. And then furthermore, I wonder, you know, having seen thousands of people, you must have ideas about what it means. But somehow, uh, it almost seemed to me as if you were simply curious and in wonder about what it was and that you didn't have in your mind a pre-determined idea that you thought you were trying to pull out. And that in fact, you were just really wondering what it was. At least it, it's in very much-, 

00:51:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL You got it. 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN All right. Yeah, so what, what's the attitude toward the person and toward life that, that uh, has you be that way? 

00:51:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Well, let me see if I can answer somewhat tangentially, I think, to what you have in mind, but see how it goes. I'm trying to keep in touch with what's alive in my client right now. And a wiggle is something is going on, and I need some words to really appreciate what that something is. It isn't the what of the answer but the how of the answer that most interests me. So, a wiggle is as good as a word. There's a slogan for you. It, it tells me to inquire further here. Thanks for the question. Next? 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN Uhm, hello? 

00:52:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Hello. 

00:52:35
UNKNOWN Can you hear me? Closer. How about now? 

00:52:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yes. 

00:52:35
UNKNOWN Now? Okay. Uh, right at this moment I'm a little anxious, as you can see. Uhm, but I would like very much first to express appreciation for your style, uhm, which I found very, very powerful and yet very, very respectful and sensitive and for how you went back and forth, I thought, between the objective and the subjective. 

00:53:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I lost the very last of what you said. 

00:53:05
UNKNOWN How you went back and forth between the objective and the subjective, first starting asking about some history to sort of build support and build ground for going on together and then you went back and forth between present experience and then talking about more objective material. So I very much appreciate your style. Uhm, and also I need to say that uh, I'm a Gestalt therapist- 

00:53:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Now, I didn't get that. 

00:53:35
UNKNOWN I very much agree with a lot of what you were doing and so I'm curious to know, since you talk especially about the how and the now and not knowing and a sense of mystery about experiencing which is so much at the heart of Gestalt therapy, whether you've been influenced by that and if so, in what ways? 

00:53:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Oh my. 

00:54:00
UNKNOWN Maybe too big of a question. 

00:54:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yes, Gestalt certainly has influenced me. 

00:54:05
UNKNOWN You can only take one more question. 

00:54:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I have to stop. I am allowed only one more question. 

00:54:10
UNKNOWN Thank you. I'm wondering if you'll recall this based on what you just said. Uhm, the last client, uh, practice thing that you did up there, the gal came to a point where it seemed she, you facilitated her to realize something about herself and it seemed like she had almost an ah ha moment. At least I had one vicariously for her. And I was wondering at that moment would you offer or invite the person whether or not they would want to change that about themself, like it seemed to me you had a definite direction there and, and my gut would have been like, is that where you want to stay? Or is that okay with you? You know, I was wondering, would you be inviting the client to consider change or would you just stay with what was going on? 

00:55:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I don't know. I, I'd really have to, it'd depend on other cues. If, if I had a sense, this is a person struggling to change uh, I might then say, is that something you want to change? Uhm, but if, if it seemed to be just a narrative, then I wouldn't butt in with it. Thanks for your question. Thank all of you.
