CHARLIE SMITH Often schools look at their data and it's not what they're looking for. And it's like new curriculum instructor, new curriculum, new promethean board, new this, new that. But in reality, if we don't work with the human that's sitting in the chair, if we don't get that part right, then nothing's gonna grow. So Advisory is a place to, to, to take, um, social emotional skills and teach students how to work together, now to minimize drama, and how to, um, just really be present in the classroom. 

00:01:10
LINELLE When you're in Advisory you're in, in a, it's not just school. You're in a class with different people, different personalities, so you're gonna have to deal with those personalities which is good for when you get out of school. There's personalities all over the world. 

00:01:25
SIR So in Advisory you get to with people you don't know and kinda set yourself up for communication like, well I don't know him but I gotta, I gotta get to know him cuz we gotta get this goal accomplished. 

00:01:35
Are You Adding or Subtracting from the Group?

00:01:40
VIRGINIA JOSE How you doin? How are you? How you doin', Renee? What's up? You holdin up okay? How are ya? Chelsea, you left me hangin'. Jaysha (sp) come on down, you gotta hurry on up. How you doin' today? How you holdin'? You look good. Did you eat? You sure? What I'd like to talk to you guys about today. We're gonna learn about how working within a group situation, you can either add and support or take away and subtract from that group. Okay? So for our opener here I'd like for you to form pairs, very clear pairs. And I'm gonna give you each an envelope with several cards. And I want you to, when you open up these cards, to sort them into two different groups. One group is going to have behaviors that are adding to the group in a positive way, right? That you feel are good things that will help out in any group environment. And then the other column will be subtracting, okay? That behavior is subtracting from that group and maybe whatever they need to get done. I'm going to ask you to share out, for each pair share out what some of your responses are. And then as a group we're gonna discuss it. Cool? All right. So let's do it. Break into pairs and I'll give each of you a set. So remember we are trying to divide those cards into two separate categories, supportive behaviors okay? And the ones that are what I call off-track. They're not supportive. They're not helping the overarching goal with a group situation, okay? Do your best, I'll give you a few. 

00:03:15
Charlie Smith, Social Studies Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 

00:03:20
CHARLIE SMITH The benefits for building social emotional activities into Advisory and having students learn those skills are, from my perspective, invaluable. Um, into today's schools we're pushing more rigor, We're pushing more, uh, tougher curriculums. We're pushing more structured activities. And we're really demanding a lot of our students on a social and emotional level. 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN And this will go over here as well. 

00:03:50
VIRGINIA JOSE So here's the next step. I want you to put the most supportive at the top to the least supportive at the bottom. And then do the same for the off-track column, most off track behavior, most uh, and least off-track behavior as well. The one thing I do want you to keep in mind when you're sorting these out from most to least is that some of you might disagree with each other. And that's okay, right? Some of you might have one particular order that works, and makes sense, and it's true to you. And another might have a different. Just do your best to talk those differences out. You know, you might come to some agreement sometimes and then decide with a whole new list. All right, let's try it. 

00:04:30
[sil.] 

00:04:40
VIRGINIA JOSE So how we doing over here, guys? It looks like you have a plan. You guys have it all figured out? 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, we got it all figured out. 

00:04:45
VIRGINIA JOSE Okay. So the question is, I'm gonna start backwards. I started with the positive there, supportive. What off-track behaviors were the most? What's at the top of the list there? 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN We said distracting because it's, it's really crucial to be on task all the time. 

00:05:00
UNKNOWN Thinking my ideas are better than others, hogging the spotlight and the credit. Um, I think this is the most negative because, um, this is not, it's not about telling people, like, you're better than them. Yeah. It's supposed to... 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN It's the ideas... 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN ...that are better, that's why. You ain't giving them, other people who has an idea a chance. 

00:05:30
VIRGINIA JOSE Anybody want to start, just to share out? I'd like to hear from the pairs. 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN For the positive side, um, we picked organizing and coordinating to be the most important. And I think it's the most important because, um, like it's telling you that you, you're, what you're supposed to do and the order that you need to do them in. And like if you don't have that when you're doing group work, then like you won't know what to do and you'll be off task. And you're just gonna sit there lost and you won't finish anything. 

00:06:00
VIRGINIA JOSE You guys have encouraging as the most supportive behavior. What do we mean by encouraging? And feel free anyone who wants to jump in. 

00:06:10
UNKNOWN You have to, um, be positive. 

00:06:10
VIRGINIA JOSE Yeah. Yeah. I'm lovin it. Great. Complimenting, boosting their confidence, their morale. Good, good. Helping them out. Yeah. Yeah. Or like my mom says, (non-English narration ), right? That's what she says. I'd like to ask three of you, okay, regarding what your top ranking off-track behavior was. I actually want to start with Jayshel's (sp) group. What did you guys pick? 

00:06:40
UNKNOWN Dominating. 

00:06:40
VIRGINIA JOSE Why did you choose dominating as your high ranking one? 

00:06:45
UNKNOWN Because over it says, telling others what to do, insisting my ideas are better than others, hogging to spotlight and the credit. Um, personally I feel like people shouldn't tell other people what to do especially if you're like, going around saying, uh, my ideas are better than yours. You know, it's basically like de-ranking them. It's making them feel like they don't belong when everybody has a voice and everybody belongs. It doesn't matter who you are, where you come from, or race you are. 

00:07:15
VIRGINIA JOSE We're gonna be working on a reflection. So we're gonna think a little deeper and I'm gonna ask for the input of all of you. I also have a little poster that talks about all of these behaviors that we've been talking about. But this piece I'm going to have in our room so that anytime we're in our sessions I'm gonna notice and I hope you can, too, some of these behaviors. And I'm gonna encourage you guys to really point out the things that are adding to our group and the things that are taking away. So I'm gonna keep this up right over there and as we go into our reflection for our activity, keep these things in mind. Okay? I want you to tell me, in your opinion, what positive supporting behavior we would like to see more of. From all of these choices that you guys had a chance to kinda sort through? 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN Encouraging because like, some people have their moments and their days. Like they don't like being in the group. 

00:08:15
VIRGINIA JOSE Yeah, and when you say moments and those days and not wanting to be in the group, what do you mean by that? 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN Some of these (ph) problems, probably. 

00:08:20
VIRGINIA JOSE With the group or just like... 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN No, like family (ph) problems. 

00:08:25
VIRGINIA JOSE Got it. 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN Um, I think organizing and coordinating. 

00:08:30
VIRGINIA JOSE And why? 

00:08:30
UNKNOWN Because um, sometimes we do get off-track and, um, sometimes we do like get back on track but other times we, we just stay off-track and you know, um, sometimes we actually have to do some things that we have to get to. 

00:08:45
VIRGINIA JOSE Yeah, so great, great two suggestions there. Let's just leave it at two for now. I'm sure that there'll be more suggestions. And feel free at any time to say, you know what? Remember that little poster? I'm just gonna walk over there to remind you guys, today was about how to bring more order and harmony to a group situation. So instead of taking away, making things stressful or off-track, you want to be more productive with your time. I'm gonna leave this in the room. We might find a better location for it. And as we move along through the next two years, I want you to monitor, where are you? Where are we, really? 

00:09:25
CAROLYNN Advisory really focuses on collaboration. It doesn't really allow you to be isolated basically. Like when you go into Advisory, you have to kinda talk and engage with other peers, and engage with your teachers, and engage with instructors. And learn authority and learn, you know, getting along with other people so that when you go out to the world you have those kind of skills. You have team-building skills, you have communication skills, you have all the stuff that you need to be prepared in life.

ELLEN FLANAGAN Schools often concentrate on just the academic side of a student. And in doing so you're really missing what learning is about for an individual child.

Carlos 

00:11:00
CARLOS Yesterday in Ms. Pishny's Advisory we completed an assignment that, it was like a exercise that talked about our brain and our characteristics as people. From that assignment I learned a lot of things that had an effect on me. Cuz like a lot of the stuff that we learned was stuff that I had gone through.

Mary Pishny 

00:11:10
Math Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 9th Grade Advisory 

00:11:15
MARY PISHNY All right, welcome guys. Good to see you, Carlos. Ibsa (sp), how's it goin? How are you? Jeffrey (sp). Hey Christian. We're gonna jump right in with our gathering. Um, and we're gonna be talking all today about this idea of whether you can grow your intelligence. Can you become smarter? Can you become more intelligent? Um, so before we jump in let's start with our gathering. You guys are all gonna get a sheet of paper that says, Intelligence Statements, at the top. And if you'll see, for each statement there's a before and an after. Right now all I want you guys to do is decide how you feel about it for the before, okay? So you're gonna say, I strongly agree, I agree, I disagree, or I strongly disagree for each statement. Um, after we're done we're gonna discuss one of them a little bit closer, um, and go through your responses. Questions on what we're gonna do here? Again we're just answering that before column so leave the after row blank right now. 

00:12:20
[sil.] 

00:12:30
MARY PISHNY So I really wanna dive into, um, the first statement. You're born with your intelligence, smart, not smart, or someplace in-between. And I want us to have a discussion around this. We're gonna do a popcorn. We'll start with Carlos. I want to be a part of this so I'm gonna jump into the circle, as well. Carlos, start us off. What do you think? 

00:12:45
CARLOS I strongly disagree with the statement because I don't think you're born with any kind of smarts or intelligence. 

00:12:55
UNKNOWN Um, I said I agree that you are born with intelligence. And I just think so cuz I just think when you're born, you're just dumb or smart. So, yeah. 

00:13:05
UNKNOWN Um, I disagree with this because I think that intelligence is just like culture. You're not, um, you're not born with it. You're taught it. 

00:13:15
MARY PISHNY Interesting. That was a really strong statement to end on. Um, we're gonna break into a reading from here. I want you guys to select a partner that you feel you can really dive into a reading with and have some open conversations with. Um, in just a second when I say, break, I want you guys to find a spot in the back of the classroom where you can, um, have that, um, conversation with your partner. And I'll bring around the reading. Um, I'm quickly gonna show you guys how we wanna mark up the text. Um, as you guys read through it you'll come to breaks in the page. And as you get to that break I want you to stop, summarize what you read, underline anything that jumps out to you um, make notes. If you have a question, write that question down. So I wanna see these readings really marked up with your questions, your thinking um, your wonderings. Yes, Jeffrey? 

00:14:00
JEFFREY So what about this reflection part right here? 

00:14:00
MARY PISHNY Um, we're gonna come back to that in the end. We're also gonna come back to the after statement. So we're gonna see after this reading, if it changes how we think about intelligence. Um, but let's jump into that reading first and then we'll reflect on it after. Um, break. Go ahead and find a new partner around the circle. And we do need one group of three, folks. You guys know the drill. Mark it up. Show me what you're thinking as you're going. What questions you have. What don't you understand. What, what really, uh, surprised you, okay? All right, here we go. 

00:14:35
UNKNOWN Many people think of the brain as a mystery. They don't know much about intelligence and how it works. When they do think about what intelligence is, many people believe that a person is born either smart, average, or dumb and stays that way for life. 

00:14:50
UNKNOWN But new research shows that the brain is more like a muscle. It changes and gets stronger when you use it. And scientists have been able to show just how the brain grows and gets stronger when you learn. So um, I think what this is talking about is like you need that, you need that experience. The brain grows, it feeds off the information that you get as you go on in life. So just like how we were talking in the group, like how people were saying like you're, you're dumb. Bam! Like I'm saying, it's not true. You're not, you're not just dumb. 

00:15:25
MARY PISHNY All right, guys. Um, from what I can see everyone's finished their reading. We're gonna come back together as a group and kind of debrief, um, what we learned from the reading. First, I'd like you guys to take, let's take about a minute is I think how it'll take us to now take a look at the after statement. I want you guys to respond to each statement now that we've read the reading, okay? And then we're gonna go over, have our responses changed, have they stayed the same? So let's take about a minute.

9th Grade Advisory 

00:16:00
JANAE GAYLE All right. So we're gonna be looking specifically at the brain and what our brains can do for us, all right? So the way that it, if you look through this article you'll see all of these different points where it says, pause and reflect. I'm going to read a section and at that section where it says or, right where it says, pause and reflect, I'm going to ask you guys to turn and talk, all right? So you're gonna pick someone that you're next to, one of your elbow partners, and you're going to spend 30 seconds talking about what you, what I just read, and what you heard, and how you interpret it. Does that make sense? We understand what's goin on? Excellent! All right. You can grow your intelligence. New research shows the brain can be developed like a muscle. By Dr. Carol D. Dweck, 2008. Many people think of the brain as a mystery. They don't know much about intelligence and how it works. When they do think about what intelligence is, many people believe that a person is born either smart, average, or dumb and stays that way for life.(sp 

00:17:00
EMANUEL I really do disagree with what they say now about, um, that many people believe that you're born smart, not smart or whatever, and that it stays that way. Nah. Cuz in here it says if you try there is a way of getting smarter if you're not that smart or something, so. 

00:17:20
UNKNOWN Um, it's saying that the smartest person, everybody could be like that but all they have to do is practice. 

00:17:25
JANAE GAYLE And can I have everybody's attention back into the circle. 

00:17:25
UNKNOWN But when I was in the eighth grade like I used to have 65 in my math class but now I'm up to hundreds because I practice. 

00:17:35
JANAE GAYLE And can I have everybody back into the circle, please? All right now, this is the last section. What can you do to get smarter? Just like a weight lifter or a basketball player, to be a brain athlete you have to exercise and practice. Being exposed to that kind of article is not something that would happen in like a regular, core class. Um, but Advisory gave us the time in order to explore something like effort. 

00:18:05
EMANUEL Because when I started this worksheet, like I was just saying things, um, with what I just thought from my life without that much knowledge of the brain and how it works. But now since I read the article, for the after section now I'm like, I might disagree whatever I wrote before. 

00:18:20
JANAE GAYLE Ah! That is the perfect segue into what I want you guys to do. So now we have that after section, all right? Take a marker. Take a marker and I want you guys to fill out that after section. So after having read the, the uh, I have to give you one (inaudible ). After having read the article and seen what the article says about brain research, you can use mine, I want you to take a look at those five statements again. Do you agree with them? Do you disagree with them? Has anything changed between the beginning of this session and now? 

00:19:05
[sil.] 

00:19:15
JANAE GAYLE So we just read this article about your intelligence and the way in which the new brain research and what people have thought about intelligence. Interpret that for yourself. And on this sheet of paper where it says reflection, I want you to reflect on that, all right? And so those two bullet points are guiding questions to help you reflect on the article and yourself. 

00:19:45
[sil.] 

00:20:05
JANAE GAYLE All right, you guys have done an amazing job today. Hopefully after today's session, um, the two things that you guys have picked up is that one, um, effort pays off and two, that intelligence is not fixed. Okay? So if you work really, really hard. and you practice, practice, practice, practice, not only will you get smarter, but you'll also do better in school. All right? And of course that's, that's our goal here, all right? Um, really, really good job. Anybody else have any closing comments, any last words they want to say about the article? Go ahead. 

00:20:45
UNKNOWN This article's shown me that no one is dumb. People take time to understand the concept and other people learn faster than others. But it still doesn't mean you or any person is dumb. 

00:20:50

9th Grade Advisory 

00:20:55
JANAE GAYLE I like that. I really like that. Really, really good. All right, very nice. To have students see that it's not, it's not all about you know, she's just smart. She's just a smart kid. And to not only have the research there and to discuss that, I know that, uh, a couple of them came up to me after the session and was just like, really this is really, really cool. 

00:21:20
Emanuel 

00:21:20
EMANUEL That brain activity and Advisory yesterday help me to, to, it helped me want to study more cuz when I learned in there that the more master you have on a subject or on something you're trying to learn about, the easier it is to learn. So since usually in school I don't really check my notes really - I don't know why, I should - but now I decided that I should. Cuz I do have difficulty with tests but I guess it's just cuz lack of notes. You know, reading it through. 

00:21:50
Carlos 

00:21:55
CARLOS What we learned from our article yesterday, I think that when we struggle we, we're not taking the time to think about what we're doing. Like we're just not focused or anything so if we put more effort onto what we're doing and more focus, I think we can like get through those, get through struggling and pass that. 

00:22:10
EMANUEL So now knowing all those things I feel more confident about high school. And that skill that we get from Advisory is always gonna stay with us for that and beyond.

ELLEN FLANAGAN If you only address education from an academic lens, you're not going to get the full, um, learning of a student. Learning takes place in a social aspect, learning takes place in an academic aspect, and in an emotional aspect. 

00:24:00
Charlie Smith, Social Studies Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 

00:24:00
CHARLIE SMITH Well I think the social emotional pieces can be included in Advisory are something that the whole school could buy into. Like how do you have professional conversations? How do you have healthy relationships? And I think that's something that everybody can benefit from. 

00:24:15
Marne Gulley, English Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 

00:24:15
MARNE GULLEY As an academic teacher too, man, I can't even start to get students to focus on academic work if there's huge emotional things going on. Um, and I know we've shared this with students and we know that brain research shows if you're going through trauma or stress, like your brain isn't physically capable of handling the academic side of things.

Virginia Jose 

00:24:35
Visual Arts Teacher, South Bronx Preparatory: A College Board School, NYC 

00:24:40
VIRGINIA JOSE Today we're gonna be working on a little bit around conflict, how you understand conflict. So some of our activities are gonna ask that you guys kind of step out of yourselves a little bit and really just look at situations okay? In order to better understand what conflict is, how does it affect us, what kind of things come out of there, positive and negative. Okay? So the first thing as a gathering, I want you guys to over on the space to our left we're going to split into two groups. One line on one side of that blue line, and on the other side another set. Now that could be six and seven and you're gonna face each other. But that imaginary line is going to be in the middle. Got it? Let's try it out. 

00:25:25
[sil.] 

00:25:30
VIRGINIA JOSE Okay. Not bad, not bad. Let's try to make it as even as we can. Good. That's not bad. So I'm going to make a few statements. And whenever you hear a statement that you agree with, I want you to actually step onto the imaginary line sort of like this. But the key is not to say a word. I know you're tempted. I know you wanna say stuff but you don't want to say anything. I just want you to notice, notice who's on the line, what you might have in common there. And then you're going to take a step back. I'm gonna say another statement and you're gonna do it again, only if you agree with it. This is based on your own feelings about what I'm saying, okay? All right so, first one. I have conflicts in my life. Okay. 

00:26:25
[sil.] 

00:26:30
VIRGINIA JOSE Sometimes I've had conflicts with my closest friends. 

00:26:35
[sil.] 

00:26:40
VIRGINIA JOSE Okay. It takes a lot to get me angry. 

00:26:50
[sil.] 

00:26:55
VIRGINIA JOSE Okay. I avoid conflicts. Okay. Good things can come out of conflicts. 

00:27:20
[sil.] 

00:27:25
VIRGINIA JOSE Usually I can work through my conflicts. 

00:27:30
[sil.] 

00:27:35
VIRGINIA JOSE I have conflicts with family members. Okay. When I have a conflict with someone I have a hard time resolving it. So I'm gonna ask that we go back to our table just as a roundtable and we're gonna kinda reflect on what just happened very briefly, okay? Let's try that.

JOSEPH KANKE All right, guys. Today we're going to have a lesson on conflict. How many of you by show of hands have conflict in your lives? That's what I assumed. All of us, right. Well, we're going to take a deeper look at that. 

00:28:30
[sil.] 

00:28:35
JOSEPH KANKE So when you see the word conflict, what are some words that are similar that? Or what are other words we can use in place of conflict.

00:29:15
JOSEPH KANKE So could I say like broken relationships? 

00:29:20
UNKNOWN Sad. 

00:29:25
JOSEPH KANKE Sad or depressed, right. 

00:29:25
UNKNOWN Uh, probably like loneliness, too. Cuz like, like you said like in the broken relationships, you probably like off alone or something. You feel lonely. 

00:29:30
JOSEPH KANKE Does anyone else have any other feelings? 

00:29:35
UNKNOWN You be angry. 

00:29:35
JOSEPH KANKE Angry for sure. So what do we notice about these things? These words, sorry. 

00:29:45
UNKNOWN They're all negative. 

00:29:45
JOSEPH KANKE Yes. They're all negative words, right? A conflict is a natural part of life. In fact, I'd say it comes up every day in different ways. Does anyone have an idea of one place you might find conflict in your life? 

00:29:55
UNKNOWN School. 

00:29:55
JOSEPH KANKE School. 

00:30:00
UNKNOWN Home. 

00:30:00
JOSEPH KANKE (inaudible ) 

00:30:01
UNKNOWN Home. 

00:30:01
JOSEPH KANKE Home, yes. Anyone else? Ruby (sp), do you have any conflict in your life? 

00:30:05
RUBY Yeah, at home. 

00:30:05
JOSEPH KANKE So all of you just responded that you have conflicts in your life. So I want you to take a minute and think of a time that you had a conflict in your life, and after you got through it something positive happened from that. Now it might take a while to go through your memories so what I'm going to have you do is pause and have you do a turn and talk. A turn and talk is where you're gonna just talk to your neighbor, and you're just gonna kind of talk through that. And a turn and talk just gives you some time to kind of like think about what you're gonna say. Because it is Monday and we need time to think, okay? Mm-hmm. So if you guys would just be a pair here. And you two, and you two, and you two. And I'm just gonna give you a minute to talk to each other about what kind of positive things you guys have gotten off conflict. Okay? 

00:30:50
UNKNOWN Well like one positive thing that I thought was like the relationship between me and my mom. Like at first it was bad because we would always be arguing and stuff but like after awhile we noticed that we fight a lot and we found a way to make it better so now our relationship be like stronger and stuff. 

00:31:05
RUBY That happened with me and my dad, too. We always argue about the dumbest things but we're getting along. 

00:31:15
JOSEPH KANKE All right. Now that we've had a chance to talk to our neighbors, have we thought of some situations where good things have come from conflict? 

00:31:20
JOSE Me and my brother always used to like fight around the room. Like we used to horseplay and stuff, and we used to fight. And, um, my, my parents they would tell like, you know, be quiet, sit down. 

00:31:30
JOSEPH KANKE Using the conflict web we had some students that were willing to share some examples, especially with parents, where they were in situations of conflict and they were able to, um, turn those conflicts into something positive. And if you don't mind I heard one other thing, too. Would you say that you made stronger relationships? Cuz we have down here 'broken relationships,' but it sounds like you got to play with your brother and your cousin, right? 

00:31:55
JOSE Yeah. 

00:31:55
JOSEPH KANKE So even though there were some conflicts in there, you can build stronger relationships. Is that fair to say? 

00:32:00
UNKNOWN Uh, pretty much leads to what you're talking about with the stronger relationships. 

00:32:05
JOSEPH KANKE Do you mind giving an example? 

00:32:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, it was just like with my mom. Like before we always used to argue a lot, a lot, a lot, like almost every day. And then like, like now that we're getting older and stuff we just realized that fighting is dumb. So like instead of fighting we just our like, our relationship as my mother it got stronger, you know? And we just get along better now. We, we play around and stuff, we hardly ever argue. 

00:32:30
JOSEPH KANKE So what I hear is that when you can tell your mom is getting angry you can kind of read those emotions before it gets out of control. And you can, by reading those emotions you can turn it around. So as you can see from conflict that happens all around us, so we have conflict with our parents, our teachers and our guardians. Um, I think the main thing we can learn is that conflict can paralyze us. So what's another word for paralyze? 

00:33:00
UNKNOWN Cripple. 

00:33:00
JOSEPH KANKE Cripple, yeah. So you can like freeze up and it won't help you as a person. Or you can use conflict to become a better person. You can learn from it. You can grow from it.

00:33:10
LIZZY KRUEGER So today we are going to do a ball toss. And we're gonna be talking about things that make us angry, our anger triggers. Okay? So I want everyone to start thinking about something in your mind that really makes you angry, upset, frustrated. What we're gonna do is I'm gonna toss the ball first. I'm gonna say, I get angry when. And I'll say my example and I'm gonna toss the ball. Okay? Whoever catches it repeats what makes me angry and then also says something that makes them angry, or upset, or frustrated. Okay? So think silently for a second about things that make you angry and be prepared to catch. Okay. One thing that really makes me angry is seeing bullying happen with kids in the school. Eli. 

00:33:55
ELI Um, one thing that makes you angry is students bullying each other inside the school. One thing that makes me angry is when people are talking about me. 

00:34:05
NORA Um, one thing that makes Eli angry is when people are talking things about him. What makes me angry is when they call me names. 

00:34:20
JOSE Nora, Nora said that one thing that makes her angry is, um, when they call, people call her names. And one thing that makes me angry is when people doesn't respect you. 

00:34:35
UNKNOWN Jose said that what gets him angry is when people don't respect each other. And what gets me angry is racism. 

00:34:40
Lizzy Krueger 

00:34:40
Science Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 

00:34:40
LIZZY KRUEGER I think with adolescents, they are going through so many social and emotional times that it's important to build time into the school day in order to talk about that. Um, the social and emotional lessons that we do really enhance their awareness of each other and of themselves. 

00:35:00
JASMINE What makes Elena (sp) is when people argue with no reasons. And what makes me mad is when I get misunderstood. 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN What makes, um, Jasmine made is when she's misunderstood. What makes me mad is gossip and rumors. 

00:35:25
LIZZY KRUEGER All right. So everyone has conflict. It's a totally natural part of life. But it is our job to manage it. Thank you. So what I wanna do now is everyone's gonna grab a chair and we're gonna circle up. Okay? Go ahead. 

00:35:40
[sil.] 

00:35:45
LIZZY KRUEGER Here you go. So we talked a little bit about our anger triggers. I'd like you to talk with a partner now about some things that are anger reducers for you, that take away your anger, that help your anger, that make it kind of start to go away.

00:36:00
VIRGINIA JOSE There are times in our lives when our conflicts and what makes us feel angry changes us. Right? We don't always act at our best during those situations. But there are things we can do about them. Conflict is normal, right? We already know that. But there are things that we can do to handle them so that we don't come out on the negative every single time. Okay? We're gonna look at some reducers, some things that could help you reduce the amount of I'm gonna say, flipping out. Okay? The, the normal conflict that comes in. How well can we handle them? We're gonna head back to our groups and we're gonna do the next segment. Okay? Let's go. Think about some ways that you can actually calm down when you're very frustrated, or angry, or just generally upset. And I'm gonna give everybody a post-it note and feel free to grab a pen or a marker and jot down what those things, those strategies, right? We're trying to figure out what can help. 

00:37:05
UNKNOWN How many ideas do you want us to write down on the post-it notes? 

00:37:05
VIRGINIA JOSE That's a really good question. What I would like you to do is on each post-it note write down one idea that helps you calm down. 

00:37:15
[sil.] 

00:37:50
VIRGINIA JOSE All right. Wow, you guys have the most amazing responses. Look at this table. Look around. Look how many responses you guys came up with. So what I'd like to do next is I'm gonna gather some of your responses, the best ones. And we're gonna call these anger reducers. We were talking about the triggers, right? The things that get us going, that work our nerves in the last activity. this time let's make our list of what will help us manage it better and calm us down. So again it's 'anger reducers.' Who'd like to go first? Okay. 

00:38:30
UNKNOWN When I get angry or, I just go outside and I go skateboarding. 

00:38:35
UNKNOWN To calm me down more I try to listen to smooth music like jazz and stuff. 

00:38:40
VIRGINIA JOSE All right, guys. That was very good. The bell's about to ring. We definitely have to keep talking about this tomorrow cuz this is actually a good way to help each other in a place that's safe. And we can offer suggestions but also take with us an understanding of who we are.

LAURIE HAHN JANSER The conflict resolution and, um, anger management that has kind of evolved out of those conversations has been, um, has resulted in a student that is passing all of her classes, that is set to graduate on time, that is no longer dealing with discipline issues, and she's able to meet her potential in the classroom because she has been able to develop those emotional and um, social skills. 

00:39:35
Dominique 

00:39:35
DOMINIQUE I learned that, how to control like instead of lashing out like I used to, just you know, to be more calm about it. 

00:39:45
Antoinette 

00:39:45
ANTOINETTE In my Advisory, my advisor has tell me that when I have a personal conflict or any kind of conflict, that I take a breather and I just relax and think about my actions before I do them so that I won't get into trouble. 

00:40:00
Tanisha 

00:40:00
TANISHA I've just learned to be really honest, just in general. Like instead of hiding what I really feel towards anything, I've just learned that I need to be honest. My advisor's a real honest person and if she has an issue with anything she'll let you know. So I've kinda picked that up, you know, along the way. And I, I learned that you know, growing up and maturing I need to learn to be honest with anything and everything that you know, I'm dealing with. And she really helped me realize that.
