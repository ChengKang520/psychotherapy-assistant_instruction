DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in your trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma recovery today. Let's start with the most basic meaning of the term Neuroplasticity. It stands for neuro: the nerve cells in our brains and our nervous system which drives much of what it hurts in our minds than bodies. And plasticity which stands for plastic or the ability essentially to change, stretch and shape. The plastic parts suggest that after trauma the brain can change, become more anxious and fearful for example, so that's the negative part of it. And same like, the brain can change aim to work through the trauma experience and find ways to adapt and cope and managing history of trauma and loss, essentially to move toward post-traumatic growth and recovery. It's pretty profound that the brain has the capacity to change even when we have been exposed to terrible loss and trauma. Norman Deutche is at the forefront of the work on Neuroplasticity. In Deutche's work he's recognized that working through a trauma history allowing the memory to resurface and then addressing story in the therapeutic setting manner can lead to growth beyond trauma and that these memories are modifiable. That the fear response associated with the trauma memory and the anxiety that goes along with a posttraumatic moment can be retrained. Deutche says that this ability exists from the time that you're born to the time you die. So, it's never too late to grow towards a posttraumatic growth. So, since for most of us, there is an emotional core or a triggering event that leads us down the path of worry and fear. We need to find that core and to work through it to get us to a better place. This piece of work is something I encourage everyone to do. Deutche explains that if we make a mistake or we experience the trauma, we get a feeling related with it, something like, "Oh! It's a mistake", and a nagging sense of something is wrong. Then we feel a sensation, a fear or worry like "Oh, my goodness", moment, "What did I just do?" or "What just happened?" And a thought and an urgent need to fix or correct the error. Finally, if we correct there, we move on. However, if we are unable to fix the mistake, error or trauma, we hold onto the error of feeling, like you say to yourself, "I left home during rush hour and I had an accident" or maybe "I… I married the wrong person" or "I failed to umm… pass an important test." Whatever it is, the problem sticks with us and we are left with and "I can't get over it" or "I feel stuck" feel. So the big job of feeling stuck is to fully and deeply understand that we are not just going to get over the feeling of mistake. But that we need to not review and replay it. Because that's just reinforces the sensation of the big error is that we need to practice acceptance, accepting the feeling by noticing, without allowing ourselves to sink into anger, hurt, frustration, annoyance, fear. We have to practice noticing without losing our worth(ph). We have to practice noticing without getting into fear. We have to practice noticing without simply getting angry with ourselves or those around us. This means noticing helps us. This noticing means the mistake associated with trauma itself is what's going to get us to a less sticky rather than a more sticky place. Overtime, because we are not viewing the mistake this sticky feeling, or strong emotion driven by related behavior. Today's practice is Neuroplasticity- The brain can change. Let's practice together. The next thing to do when you get the… "I feel stuck" feeling and all the associated fears, worries that go along with it, is to acknowledge and replace it with a pre-selected pleasure exercise. Listening to music, watch an inspirational video, going for a walk. Over time, you weaken the link between the memory of the mistake and the bad feelings and urges that go along with it. Practice this again throughout the day whenever you need to recapture feelings of comfort or calm. Take the time right now to form a healthy practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
