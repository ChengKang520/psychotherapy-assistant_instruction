On a Secret Mission: 

00:00:30
An Undercover Anti-bullying Team 

00:00:30
at Work in School 

00:00:30
with 

00:00:30
John Winslade. Ph.D. 

00:00:30
JOHN WINSLADE Hello, my name is John Winslade and I'm a professor at California State University... 

00:00:35
John Winslade, Ph.D. 

00:00:35
JOHN WINSLADE ...San Bernardino. And this is a video and a series of videos on School counseling. And this particular video is going to give you an example of a... 

00:00:45
Undercover 

00:00:45
Anti-Bullying 

00:00:45
Team 

00:00:45
JOHN WINSLADE ...special process, an exciting new process called an Undercover Anti-Bullying Team. Now as the name suggests, it's the process that's designed to address situations where bullying has been taken place. And what I mean by bullying includes a variety of things, it includes persistent teasing, it includes physical bullying and includes relational aggression or what has been called relational aggression and also includes things that we now-a-days called cyber-bullying. The approaches based on different than normal approach and that it avoids punishment and therefore avoids the possibility of the victim... 

00:01:25
Avoids Punishment 

00:01:25
Avoids Retaliation 

00:01:25
JOHN WINSLADE ...receiving retaliation for speaking to an adult about what has happened when they have been bullied. Rather than that and rather than using a punishing approach, it enlists students... 

00:01:35
Enlists students 

00:01:35
to change and transform 

00:01:35
the bullying relation 

00:01:35
JOHN WINSLADE ...into changing and transforming, in fact, the bullying relation. It includes both bullies and the bystanders in the process of transformation and actually doesn't even require the victim to confront the bully but the victim does, on the other hand, have the power of veto to decide when the process has been successful and when it will be brought to a close. 

00:01:55
Crying for Help 

00:01:55
the No Blame Approach 

00:01:55
to Bullying 

00:01:55
by 

00:01:55
George Robinson 

00:01:55
Barbara Maines 

00:01:55
JOHN WINSLADE The origins of this approach lie in the Maines' and Robinson's No Blame Approach to Bullying, but it was developed a little bit by Bill Howard and then by Mike Williams and it was written about, in their book, the book of Mike Williams and I wrote about write called Safe and Peaceful Schools. This is one place where you can find an explanation of how the undercover team process works. The principles of this process are based on the narrative idea that the person is... 

00:02:25
The Person is not the Problem 

00:02:25
The Problem is the Problem 

00:02:25
- Michael White 

00:02:25
JOHN WINSLADE ...not the problem, the problem is the problem. In this case what that means is, the bully is not the problem, the bullying is the problem. Bullying, as we think of it, is a relational exchange that takes places along a familiar and well-known... 

00:02:40
A Familiar and 

00:02:40
well-known plot 

00:02:40
trajectory 

00:02:40
JOHN WINSLADE ...plot trajectory. In other words, the people that are doing it did not invented, they didn't start it up, they're just carrying out a plot that is already known, well-known. 

00:02:50
A narrative performance 

00:02:50
which needs to be 

00:02:50
replaced by a 

00:02:50
performance of some 

00:02:50
kind of other relationship 

00:02:50
JOHN WINSLADE In these terms, we think of bullying as a narrative performance that needs to be replaced with the performance of some other kind of relationship. It's not the result of the bullies as persons being bad people or sick people, because I don't believe that anyone is a bully by nature. Often those people who are doing the bullying are not even fully aware of the effects of their actions on others. But they're also participating in this bullying relationship with a person who is in the designated position of being a victim and with other students who had designated as bystanders. These are names as I think... 

00:03:30
Positions in a relation 

00:03:30
rather than Persons 

00:03:30
JOHN WINSLADE ...of them as of positions in relation rather than of persons. Actually bullies are often of high surface team and tend often to be leaders in other ways in the school. 

00:03:40
Targeting Difference 

00:03:40
JOHN WINSLADE Sometimes they are acting upon general, social norms about anybody who is different and targeting difference for being the victims of bullying. So it's not surprising therefore, the most common people who become victims of bullying are students with disabilities, men with a racial minorities, LGBTQ students or anyone who is different in any other way you can imagine. So let's talk about the undercover team. An undercover team involve six students and not that -- it doesn't include the victim but it does include, surprisingly, the two worst bullies; they are included in the undercover team. But they are outnumbered by four other members of the team who are students who have not been bullied or have been not being doing any bullying. They are nominated by the victim and sometimes with some help from a teacher to become members of the team. They are invited then to participate in an undercover project. The undercover project creates some intrigue which students often really enjoy, but it also encourages them to be careful not to give the game away of what they're doing and to think about it a little more in terms of how they will actually make the person who has been the victim feel better and their relationships with others in the school. 

00:05:05
Not to engage in 

00:05:05
confrontation with the bully 

00:05:05
but rather to change the 

00:05:05
experience of the victim 

00:05:05
JOHN WINSLADE The goal is not to -- not so much to get and engaged in any kind of confrontation with the bully, although that sometimes can happen, so much is to change the experience of the victims, so that they are not being continuing to suffer the effects of the bullying itself. The bullies are given a choice whether or not to join in with the change or at least not to interfere with what others are doing. And they're not required to out themselves or to be blamed or to be even identified unless they choose to do so for themselves. 

00:05:40
Initial Meeting 

00:05:40
The Counselor and 

00:05:40
The Victim 

00:05:40
JOHN WINSLADE So how does the process work? The undercover team begins with the counselor in the school, talking with the victim, and interviewing them about what has happened and what effect he just had. Then the victim is invited to name the six students who will be the part of the undercover team. Later, the team itself is gathered together, the victim is not present and the team is invited to be part of the change. They're told the story of what's happened before they get to know who the person, who is the victim has been. And they never told the names of the bullies and but the two bullies, two worst bullies are sitting there and they have the choice of outing themselves or else staying quite and resisting any kind of invitation or impulse to take up responsibility or blame themselves. But in order not to do that they actually have to take part in or at least support or least implicitly support the change or transformation that's about to take place. From there, the counselor meets alternatively with the team and with the victim, the undercover team and with the victim, every few days to check on and monitor progress. It usually takes about two weeks and sometimes longer and as the victims job to tell the counselor when the team has been successful and when their job is usually is completed. At this point, they're usually given a certificate from the school principal and a small food voucher to thank them for their role and invited to talk about how they find out. Most students find the process fun to be part of and they enjoy the chance to do some that makes the difference for somebody else. All the way through, the process is monitored carefully by the counselor writing down exactly what the students say and the exact words that they use. So we're going to show you this process now. It's going to be a role play rather than an actual situation, because that will be too hard to, first, to film. As designated or designed, if you like, to illustrate the process and it's not obviously going to show all the problems that can come up and there are many of them, there are many challenges that can arise, anything you can imagine has happened. But even so, despite the fact that anything you can imagine has happened many, many, many times this process has proved very, very successful and it has changed the experience of people who have been victims of bullying. It's also I think affected the culture of bullying within a classroom and within a school. So my invitation to you is to watch it and think about how you might be able to use it and implement this in your school rather than sitting and watching it and thinking of when it might go wrong and what might not work. So let's have a look now at the role play of an undercover anti-bullying team. 

00:08:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Well, Howard, thanks for coming. And I know, I called you down here because I heard from Mr. Lopez, he's your teacher, right? 

00:08:45
 Yeah. 

00:08:45
JOHN WINSLADE Right. And he told me that this morning you looking like you are upset and he was concerned about you, okay? So I'm wondering what's been happening that's been leaving you -- you are feeling upset, because I'm concerned about that? 

00:09:00
 No, people who has been, like, bullying me like, calling me names. 

00:09:05
JOHN WINSLADE Really. 

00:09:05
 And stuff. 

00:09:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Okay. That's obviously concerning you. So I'd like to find out a little about what's been going on? Can you tell me a little bit about when you say people being bullying you, what does that mean? What is that? What's been happening? 

00:09:20
 No, they're telling me, I'm frozen stuff and fatten stuff, like that. 

00:09:30
JOHN WINSLADE All right. Like when you say people, you mean, it's been a lot of people or it's just one person or what? 

00:09:40
 Like two people about. 

00:09:40
JOHN WINSLADE Two people, on particular? 

00:09:45
 Yeah. 

00:09:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:09:45
 They have been doing a lot of thing. 

00:09:45
JOHN WINSLADE  All right. But when you just recently come to the school, just a few weeks ago, right? 

00:09:55
 Hmm. 

00:09:55
JOHN WINSLADE As has this been happening, they recently got you or just more recently than that or what? 

00:10:00
 It's been happening like after the first day there are some. 

00:10:05
JOHN WINSLADE After the first time, right? So this is like about four weeks now, right? So I think, its better, right? Yeah, okay. So I mention that's been pretty awful for you. 

00:10:20
 Yeah. 

00:10:20
JOHN WINSLADE It is, okay. And you've mentioned that they have been calling your names, anything else that has been going on? 

00:10:30
 No, not really, but... 

00:10:35
JOHN WINSLADE Right, no one has actually touched you or done anything that hurt you physically? 

00:10:40
 Oh, they haven't, but -- I don't know, they sound like it's scaring to that. 

00:10:45
JOHN WINSLADE Now you are concerned about that or afraid of that will happen? 

00:10:50
 Yeah. 

00:10:50
JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. Okay. So what, when something like this happens, I got an idea of thing that we sometimes do, that in my experience always seems to work to fix a situation on that, so that it feels better on that you are not being bullied in anyway. And I'm wondering if you would be willing to try this and see if we can actually make that happens, so that the bullying goes away. What do you think about that? 

00:11:30
 Sure. 

00:11:30
JOHN WINSLADE You kind of willing to give this a try? 

00:11:35
 Yes. 

00:11:35
JOHN WINSLADE A little bit, a little bit unsure but you're willing to try, from what I've seen in your face, is that right? 

00:11:45
 Yes. 

00:11:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. What we call is what is an undercover anti-bullying team and it involves actually getting together a group of people who can help you to not feel like you have been bullied and to feel like you're actually being made welcome in this school, because that's what we will really like to see happen for you. How is that sound? 

00:12:10
 Sounds good. 

00:12:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So in order to do that, I've got a little sheet of paper here that I want you to just carefully note down from you, if that's okay. Is that okay if I write down some things that you tell me? 

00:12:20
 Okay. 

00:12:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. And I want to write down really what's been happening, so that I can actually -- what we're going to do is actually write these things down and you're not going to actually have to meet with this team and who are going to support you at all. I'm just going to talk to you and then I'm going to talk to them on their. Okay? 

00:12:40
 Okay. 

00:12:40
JOHN WINSLADE And I'm gonna write down what's been going on and that I'm gonna tell them what's been going on and ask them what they think about it and see if they can come up with some ideas to make things, these things change that make you feel better? 

00:12:55
 Okay. 

00:12:55
JOHN WINSLADE Is it okay? 

00:12:55
 Sure. 

00:12:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. There is one other thing and this is going to be bit of a surprise. I'm going to ask the people who've been doing the bullying to be part of this team and they're going to try to help to make things different for you. And that's a bit of surprise, I guess, right. Yeah. In my experience that's actually one of the most important things, because it helps them to realize what's going on and to stop this and to change it for them as well. But I'm not going to get anybody into trouble, right. I'm not going to be blaming anyone, I'm not going to be asking anyone to be punished, no one's going to be punished, we're actually going to be -- the aim is not find out who did something wrong and punish him, the aim is to help you feel better at school. Is that okay? 

00:13:40
 Yes. 

00:13:40
JOHN WINSLADE Any questions about that, so far? 

00:13:45
 So the bullies are going to do it? 

00:13:50
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, well, they're going do it or at least going to help the others to do it? 

00:13:50
 Do you know who they are? 

00:13:55
JOHN WINSLADE I don't know the bullies, I'm going to ask you they, you're going to have to tell me? Is that okay. 

00:14:00
 Yeah. 

00:14:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Any other questions? 

00:14:05
 No. 

00:14:05
JOHN WINSLADE I know it sounds surprising, they're going to help to do it, but I'm going to do this in a way that every time we've done this, every single time we've done it, the bullies have actually, in the end, come around to helping to make the change. And as they can help to make the change, they can often do better than anybody, so it makes sense? I know you're not sure how that's going to happen here but we'll figure it out, okay? And so, it's Ywyatt. 

00:14:35
 Yeah. 

00:14:35
JOHN WINSLADE That's right. 

00:14:35
 Yes. 

00:14:35
JOHN WINSLADE And tell me, you said that this bullying started like one day after the start of school, right? 

00:14:45
 Hmm. 

00:14:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so I will just write that down here. And what year are you in Ywyatt? 

00:14:55
 What? 

00:14:55
JOHN WINSLADE What year are you in, what grade? 

00:14:55
 I'm in six. I'm going into sixth. 

00:15:00
JOHN WINSLADE Sixth grade, okay. Yeah, so you have started the new school, as you're going to sixth grade, right? 

00:15:05
 Yes, I'm in sixth grade. 

00:15:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, okay. So let I talk you now to tell me what happened? What has been happening? And you got to need to tell me who are people that did it in a minute? But we'll just come to the story of what's been happening and as much detailed as you can, okay? So going back to that first day after you came here, was like the second day, I think you said. What happened that day? What happened? 

00:15:35
 People started calling my names and stuff. 

00:15:35
JOHN WINSLADE Calling my names, like what? 

00:15:40
JOHN WINSLADE Retarded. 

00:15:45
JOHN WINSLADE Like retarded. What else? I know it's not fun to repeat these things, but I need to know what exactly what the names where they were calling, what have they been call you? 

00:15:55
 Like gay and stuff. 

00:16:00
JOHN WINSLADE Gay. Anything else? Right, then I heard they have been saying this to you in class or out of class or what? 

00:16:15
 Well, when we're like changing classes. 

00:16:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. While changing classes. So, had they being doing this like every day since that day or just some days or what? 

00:16:35
 Yeah, everyday. 

00:16:40
JOHN WINSLADE Everyday. Okay. And they said the same thing every time, retarded and gay or they're saying any other thing sometimes or? 

00:16:45
 Like whom you like fat and stuff. 

00:16:50
JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. And when you say and stuff, what else is that? 

00:17:00
 Like... 

00:17:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Could you just -- this is -- you are new here, right, and that's kind of picked on you for being new here, is that being like that at all or what? 

00:17:15
 Yeah, I think it's because I'm new. 

00:17:20
JOHN WINSLADE You think, because you are new. Okay. 

00:17:25
 Yeah. 

00:17:30
[sil.] 

00:17:30
JOHN WINSLADE Because I'm new and you came here from? 

00:17:35

00:17:35
JOHN WINSLADE From Wyoming? Right? Hence you've been like another school in Wyoming, is this ever come to you before? 

00:17:50
 No. 

00:17:50
JOHN WINSLADE Sorry, what you mean? 

00:17:50

00:17:50
JOHN WINSLADE You were at home school, right? 

00:17:50
  Yeah. 

00:17:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. And let's not really what the bullying has been about those, is it or not? Or has it? 

00:18:00
 I don't know, they might do it because I'm go to home school. 

00:18:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. You are not sure. 

00:18:10
 No, I'm not sure. 

00:18:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. They might do it because I have been home schooled. Okay. Anything else that's happened? 

00:18:25
 No, not really. 

00:18:30
JOHN WINSLADE Like you haven't been -- no one has been threatening you, because you said before that you're afraid that it could get physical, you could get hurt. 

00:18:40
 Yeah, because they've been seeing it, like, what really meaning to mean stuff, you know. 

00:18:45
JOHN WINSLADE They've been saying unmeanly, right? 

00:18:45
  Yeah. 

00:18:50
JOHN WINSLADE And when they say, what do other people do? 

00:18:55
 They're like laugh at me. 

00:19:00
JOHN WINSLADE Other people laugh? 

00:19:05
 Yeah. 

00:19:05
JOHN WINSLADE Does anybody sort of like stood at and stuck up for you? 

00:19:10
 No, not really. 

00:19:10
JOHN WINSLADE Not really, okay. So if I write down no one is stuck up for me, is that right? 

00:19:20
 Yeah. 

00:19:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. No one has stuck up from me. Anything else that I need to know about what's happened? Okay. So we got a few questions to ask, like how have you been made to feel different? Have you been -- have they made you feel different from other people? 

00:19:45
 Yeah. 

00:19:45
JOHN WINSLADE How? Like, how that be, what? 

00:19:45
 Like no one likes me. 

00:19:50
JOHN WINSLADE That's it, then? What do you mean? That makes you feel like no one likes you? 

00:19:55
 Yeah. Because they don't stick up for me. 

00:20:00
JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. And no one likes you, like, they make you feel, right, no one likes you because any particular reason? 

00:20:15
 Because, like, no ones like stuck up for me on anything. 

00:20:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Because no one has stuck for me. Okay. And so what is this made you think about or feel like or what's been the effect of it for you? It's like Mr. Lopez4 assessed you are upset this morning, right? 

00:20:50
 Yeah. 

00:20:50

00:21:05
JOHN WINSLADE It makes you unfocused, right. Okay. It makes me unfocused. Now I use the word, in sounds like you've been more than unfocused. In your face right now, you look kind of focused but not really happy is, it that fair enough? 

00:21:25

00:23:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Makes me don't want to go to school. Have you did school at all or do you not? Like that's a thought that makes you, but you haven't actually done? 

00:24:10
 No. 

00:24:10
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Yeah, okay. That's great. And anything else that you guess you to think about doing or what? 

00:24:20
 No, not really. 

00:24:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Like -- I mean like sometimes you guess people to fight back or say things back to them or whatever might be and then, you hadn't thought about doing anything like that or you have done anything like that? 

00:24:40
 No. 

00:24:40
JOHN WINSLADE No, you just sort of suffered on the inside, what has been going on. 

00:24:40
 Yeah. 

00:24:40
JOHN WINSLADE Right, okay. Does anybody else know that you've been going through this? 

00:24:45
 I don't think. 

00:24:50
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Like have you talked to your family about this at all? 

00:24:55
 No. 

00:24:55
JOHN WINSLADE You haven't? 

00:24:55
 Hmm. 

00:24:55
JOHN WINSLADE Right. I understood what there might be, I must saying, you should have understood to know. Why do you think you might not done it? 

00:25:05
 They can't really willing about it. 

00:25:05
JOHN WINSLADE They can't do willing to help you. Okay. So it's like you have thought to yourself this is something I just have to do alone, right? 

00:25:15
  Yeah. 

00:25:20
JOHN WINSLADE And here that's been someone is being making you upset and suffering on your own, right and feeling lonely? 

00:25:25
 Yeah. 

00:25:25
JOHN WINSLADE  Yeah. Okay. But I'm really sorry that's been doing that for you and it's not -- but I would like, when a new person comes to our school, well, I wanted them to feel welcome and someone is upset this is happening and I wanted to do something to try and help with the stuff. How that sound to you? 

00:25:50
 Okay. 

00:25:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Tell me, one more thing I'm going to ask you and then I'm going to get on to thinking about who is going to help you? If you could get things to change, I know this is a lot to ask if you're on your own, so that's why I'm going to get some other people to help, right? What would you ideally like things to be like or do you -- if you could make things how you would like them, what would be happening? 

00:26:20
 Like, make some friends, I guess. 

00:26:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Make some friends, anything else? 

00:26:30
 Make me more focused. 

00:26:30
JOHN WINSLADE Like make me more focused, right, what else? 

00:26:50
[sil.] 

00:27:00
 Nothing else really, but... 

00:27:00
JOHN WINSLADE Will you like the bullying to stop? 

00:27:05
 Yeah. 

00:27:05
JOHN WINSLADE Right. What would you say? How will you put that? 

00:27:10
 Yeah, I want the bullying to stop. 

00:27:10
JOHN WINSLADE I want the bullying to stop. Okay. And if it's stopped, what would be happening? Like what would be happening, let us know, if that had stopped? 

00:27:30
 Well, it would be like, less -- like less focus. 

00:27:35
JOHN WINSLADE Less focused. I would feel a lot less upset. 

00:27:40
 Yeah. 

00:27:40
JOHN WINSLADE  Right. Less upset. And you will have some friends and you would be more focused, anything else that would be different? 

00:27:55
 It would make me I want to go to school. 

00:28:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Like, I would want to go to school, right? 

00:28:05
 Yeah. 

00:28:05
JOHN WINSLADE At the moment, it sounds like a lot of the time you sort of don't really want to go to school. 

00:28:15
 Yeah. 

00:28:15
JOHN WINSLADE Don't you tell your mom and dad of that or what? 

00:28:20
 No, they are like always busy. 

00:28:25
JOHN WINSLADE Right, okay. So you just have been depending this on your own? 

00:28:30
 Yeah. 

00:28:30
JOHN WINSLADE Right, okay. So, now I'm going to ask you this, what if like a team of six people who're going to help you and I need to know the names of the two people who've been doing the bullying? Because I want to invite them to be on the team, but they're going to be outnumbered by four other people. 

00:28:50
 Okay. 

00:28:50
JOHN WINSLADE So could you tell me who are the two people who've been worst at the bullying? 

00:29:00
 Dawson and Cory. 

00:29:00
JOHN WINSLADE Dawson, okay; Cory, okay. Now can you think of some names or some other people in your class who are not people who have being doing the bullying, who might be able to help out -- and as far as you know haven't been bullied themselves. And I know you haven't been here very long, but you may have some ideas at the moment of some others you might be able to help? 

00:29:30
 Katelyn. 

00:29:30
JOHN WINSLADE Katelyn, okay. Right, anybody else? 

00:29:40
 Xian. 

00:29:40
JOHN WINSLADE Xian, okay. Right. I know Xian. Yeah. Okay. Anybody else? 

00:29:50
  No. 

00:29:55
JOHN WINSLADE No, right now? 

00:29:55
 No. 

00:29:55
JOHN WINSLADE So, maybe would it be okay if I ask one -- like if I ask Mr. Lopez, if he can think of two other people who might be able to help? 

00:30:05
 Sure. 

00:30:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Well, what we're going to do is, at lunch time, I'm going to ask these four people plus the two others that Mr. Lopez suggest to come and meet with me and then I'm going to ask them to become a team that's going to help you to feel like you have more friends, that they can help you to be more focused, that they can stops the bullying and give you a chance to feel less upset and make things like that you want to go to school. Okay. 

00:30:40
 Okay. 

00:30:40
JOHN WINSLADE And then I'm going to give them a few days to try and make those things happen. But what I'm going to tell them is this, they have to do this without everybody knows, so it's like an undercover team. Understand what I mean? 

00:30:55
 Yeah. 

00:30:55
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. So they're going to -- they are not going to make it so obvious that everybody in the class can see, right? They're going to be a little bit more careful and a bit subtle. And then I'm going to ask you maybe next Monday, I'm going to ask you to come back and then I'll ask you like how have things being going, whether anything is getting better, okay? 

00:31:20
 Okay. 

00:31:20
JOHN WINSLADE All right. And if that is being going better, then that's great. But it might be until you decide that things have changed, that they get their reward and the rewards going to be a food voucher and a certificate from the principal, okay? 

00:31:40
 Okay. 

00:31:40
JOHN WINSLADE For helping you, for helping out our undercover team. But you are going to be the one who decide when they have done their job. 

00:31:50
 Okay. 

00:31:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So I'm going to keep checking with you, next Monday, and if again maybe the following Monday and again the following Monday, if need to be, and as many times as we need until we are sure that the bullying has stopped and you are feeling these things like you have some friends, that you are more focus, that you are not upset anymore and then you feel like much happier about you wanting to go to school. That's kind of what you would like, right? 

00:32:10
 Yeah. 

00:32:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Okay. Well, we will kind of keep working at this and I will work with them and get them to make this to happen. And I will keep checking with you and you don't have to confront them at all, right. The people who are doing the bullying, you just need to get on with your school work and keep staying focused on that and we'll try and change, so that you're feeling much better. I want you to feel happy and welcome to our school. Have I clear with you? 

00:32:40
 Yes. 

00:32:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Right. Thanks, Ywyatt. And I let you get back to you -- is it your math class now? 

00:32:45
 I think it's science. 

00:32:45
JOHN WINSLADE You think it's science. Math is already finished, right? 

00:32:45
 Yeah, probably. 

00:32:50
JOHN WINSLADE Probably, okay. Well, I let you go back to your science class then, okay. 

00:32:50
 Okay. 

00:32:50
JOHN WINSLADE Will catch up with you next Monday. See you then. 

00:33:00
[sil.] 

00:33:00
 So why are we here? Are we in trouble or something? 

00:33:00
JOHN WINSLADE No, no reason for trouble. I have actually asked you here to help me with something. So I just -- before I get in, I'm going to explain what that's about. But before I do, I just wanted to check who is who? Because I didn't know all of you, right. You are? 

00:33:15
 I'm Mattiya. 

00:33:15
JOHN WINSLADE Mattiya. And? 

00:33:15
 Sam. 

00:33:15
JOHN WINSLADE  Sam. And? 

00:33:20
 I'm Dawson. 

00:33:20
JOHN WINSLADE You Dawson. 

00:33:20
 Cory. 

00:33:20
JOHN WINSLADE And? 

00:33:20
  Xion. 

00:33:25
JOHN WINSLADE Xion. 

00:33:25
 Katelyn. 

00:33:25
JOHN WINSLADE And Katelyn, right. That's the names of the people I have in my here. And the reason I'm asked you here is, because I want to ask your help for something. And I've had a conversation with one of the students, I think you all know, is in your class and then some stuff is being happening, this made this person upset and unhappy. And I think, it's necessary, that's useful if we get it -- some people together to help make this person's life a bit happier. Now I'll tell you a little bit about why, is this something -- are you willing to help to make things better for somebody. 

00:34:05
 Okay. 

00:34:05
 Yeah. 

00:34:05
JOHN WINSLADE Sure. Good then. 

00:34:05
 Why not. 

00:34:05
JOHN WINSLADE Why not. Okay. You're okay with it Cory? 

00:34:10
 Okay. 

00:34:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So basically what's been happening is that there is being a little bit of some stuff has been happening, this is kind of like not about serious kind of stuff that's being kind of bullying. That's kind of being someone's being picked on and that's being going on for a while, right. Right, for about three or four weeks. And what I'd like to do is that, I'd like to tell you the story of what's been happening and then we'll think about how you might be able to help this person to feel better. And I want to be clear that what we're not doing here is finding anyone to blame, right. This isn't about finding who did it or I don't care if he did it, I just want him to stop. Okay. I don't want to -- I'm not worried about trying to blame anybody or getting you on trouble or getting anybody punished, I just want to actually help the person who is being bullied. Is that okay. Does that makes sense? Okay. So before I tell you this, I don't tell you the person's name, but I want to read out to you what's being going on first. Is that makes sense? And this person says, he's a boy who came to the school, at the start of the school year and he was new. And since he has been here, since about the second day he's been here, he says people have been calling him names or some people been calling him names like retarded or gay, especially while between classes, while classes have been changing. And this has been happening every day, sometimes they call them fat or so-looser. And he thinks that's because he is being new here. And he thinks that they might do it, because he is been home school in the past and he says they have been saying these things very meanly and he says other people have been laughing when these people have been saying these things. And what has been bothering him is that no one has struck up for him. Those are things that he's told me, right. Can you imagine what this would be like if this was happening to you? 

00:36:20
 Really bad. 

00:36:20
JOHN WINSLADE Really bad. 

00:36:25
 Yeah. 

00:36:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, okay. You wouldn't laugh it, would you? No. Well, this is what he says it's been like. He says, he's been made to feel different like nobody likes him, because nobody has stuck up for him. And he said that he feels like, in terms of school work, he starts to feel unfocused and it makes him feel lonely and like he must be adjourned. And he just wants them to stop. And when you imagine again what this would be like? If this was happening to you, Mattiya, what would you think it would be like? 

00:36:55
 Well, it'd be sick. Constantly, it'd be hard. 

00:37:05
JOHN WINSLADE It'd be hard. 

00:37:05
 Yeah. 

00:37:05
JOHN WINSLADE Right. So if you are in that situation you know what would be done, right? 

00:37:10
 Yeah. 

00:37:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Well this is what he said, he says, it's making him unfocused on the school work and he can't stop thinking about it, about what these people have been doing and so he can't think about the school work, right. And that's what we hear for, actually learn and get on with your school work. And he says sometimes it makes him -- often it makes him feel like he doesn't want to go to school. You can imagine if you were in that situation what it would be like that you not want to go to school too, you can imagine that? And when I asked him what he would really like to happen? He said these things, he would like to make some friends, because he is new here, right. And he'd like to be more focused on his school work and he'd like this bullying to stop which would help him to feel more focused. And he would like to feel less upset and he would like to feel like he wants to come to school rather than feeling like he doesn't want to come to school. Does that sound like reasonable things for anybody to want? 

00:38:15
 Yeah. 

00:38:15
JOHN WINSLADE You would agree with that too, Sam. What do you think, Dawson? 

00:38:25
 Sometimes. 

00:38:25
JOHN WINSLADE Sometimes. 

00:38:25
 You put out what stuff as they comment. 

00:38:30
JOHN WINSLADE All right. Okay. Yeah, and this stuff does happen and when it happens my hope is that we can actually work together and that's why I called you guys here to do, because your friends are here by the way because this person told me your names and suggested you has been people who might be able to help. And also I checked with Mr. Lopez and he gave me one or two extra names and so that's how come we've got you folks here. And what do you think about this, Cory, any thoughts you have about what would be like if you were in this situation? 

00:39:00
 I mean, that's sad, like, I guess. 

00:39:05
JOHN WINSLADE It's a bit sad. So you have a bit of sense of sympathy for what someone would really feeling. 

00:39:10
 I guess. 

00:39:15
JOHN WINSLADE I guess, okay. So what seems to, in my experience make a difference, is that if we can actually -- is it okay if I you tell you the name of this person? 

00:39:25
 Yeah. 

00:39:30
JOHN WINSLADE I'm going have to tell you in order if you would be able to do something, right, you need to actually -- And I'm not wanting to, as I said before, I'm not wanting to blame anybody. I don't want to get anyone in trouble, I just want to help this person feel better and it sounds like if I'm right that you're willing to do that, you are willing to kind of help me to get that happen, is that a fair assumption. 

00:39:55
 Yeah. 

00:39:55
JOHN WINSLADE You're okay with it. 

00:39:55
 Yeah. 

00:39:55
JOHN WINSLADE You two. 

00:39:55
 Yep. 

00:40:00
JOHN WINSLADE What about you, Cory? 

00:40:00
 Sure. 

00:40:00
JOHN WINSLADE And you, Xion. 

00:40:00
 Yeah. Perfect. 

00:40:00
 Good. 

00:40:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. It sounds good, right? 

00:40:00
 Yes. 

00:40:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Well, the person's name is Ywyatt. You know Ywyatt? 

00:40:05
 Oh, yeah, Ywyatt. 

00:40:10
 Oh, yeah. 

00:40:10
JOHN WINSLADE So you do know Ywyatt, right? 

00:40:10
 Everybody does. 

00:40:10
JOHN WINSLADE  Does that everybody does, right. So as you know, he is new to the school and he is being here from, I think, Wyoming that he is come from. 

00:40:20
 Yeah. 

00:40:25
JOHN WINSLADE So what I'm wanted you to do is to ask you to do this. And by the way if you are successful I want to offer you a little bit of reward, okay. I'm going to give each like a $3 food voucher and just a little thing as a token; and each of you would be able to go and buy something for yourselves as a reward for helping another person. And you're also going to get a certificate from the principal that -- there is one thing I wanted you think about this, this is going to be undercover. We call this as an undercover team. 

00:41:05
 Okay. 

00:41:05
JOHN WINSLADE And you know what undercover means, Katelyn? What is it mean to you, what do you think? 

00:41:10
 Like, if you're -- let's say if you're a spy or something, you're undercover and people don't know like what you're doing there, you're just like a person there. 

00:41:25
JOHN WINSLADE You just like one another people in the background, nobody quite know, the leader of the spy, right. 

00:41:30
 Yeah. 

00:41:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. So likely think about like that, right. And otherwise you're going to be an undercover team and the people who are not going to know, the other people in your class, the other kids. Mr. Lopez knows that we've got a team. He doesn't even know who are the people out here and he doesn't know who the person has been bullying. But he knows that this undercover team is going to be working in the class and I have asked him to keep it to the himself and not to tell to other kids, right. So you're getting the picture. 

00:41:55
 Yeah. 

00:41:55
JOHN WINSLADE  I wanted you do this a little bit carefully and a little bit secretly, but I want you to make things better for Ywyatt and see you can do that, right. And I'm going to ask you to come up with five ideas for things that we can do, that we're gonna make him feel like he has some friends, he can be more focused at school, he can feel like the bullying stopped, he can feel less upset and he can feel like, these are things he said, and he wants to go to school again, all right. So I, I'm guessing, you've probably got some really good ideas if you can actually think about them. So can anybody come with like their first suggestion of what would be one thing that you folk could do. In general, you don't have to do the same thing, you can do different things right. Because its boys and girls, sometimes the things of boys and girls do it different, right. So and anybody got a suggestion for one thing that we could do that, Ywyatt to feel like things are different. 

00:43:00
 No, maybe we could like sit with him in lunch and stuff and launch with him may be. 

00:43:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So is that okay. We've got it done. 

00:43:05
 Yeah. 

00:43:10
JOHN WINSLADE Right. So sit with him at lunch, okay. Let's think of another idea. What's another idea? 

00:43:20
 Maybe play with him, like play with him after-school. 

00:43:25
JOHN WINSLADE Play with him after-school, right. Like play -- what are you thinking about? 

00:43:30
 Maybe like soccer, basketball, I don't know. 

00:43:35
JOHN WINSLADE Like some kind of game. Play with him after-school. Okay that's two ideas. We've got the third one, you both come up with another idea. You got an idea, Mattiya? 

00:44:00
 No, I don't know. 

00:44:05
JOHN WINSLADE We'll get back to you. 

00:44:05
 Yeah. That's right. Yeah. 

00:44:05
JOHN WINSLADE And you keep thinking, we will come back to you, right. 

00:44:10
 Yeah. 

00:44:10
JOHN WINSLADE Anybody else? Dawson, you got any ideas? 

00:44:10
 No, at the moment. 

00:44:15
JOHN WINSLADE No, at the moment. Okay. What are you saying? 

00:44:20
 No, at the moment. 

00:44:20
JOHN WINSLADE No, at the moment. Cory? 

00:44:20
 Actually we could like complement him when he does something good and like. 

00:44:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Like complement him. 

00:44:25
 We can take a good grade and spin on him. 

00:44:30
JOHN WINSLADE When he gets a good grade. Okay. That's three ideas, we are doing well. We need two more. Maybe, I can get now to Mattiya. 

00:44:40
  Yeah. Just like encourage and like be more confident and just like. 

00:44:55
JOHN WINSLADE How would you do that. 

00:44:55
 Oh! 

00:45:00
JOHN WINSLADE Like the people are encouraging you. What do they do? 

00:45:00
 Oh, they say just -- they will make you feel that like you can do something easier just like, just that makes you feel better about something. 

00:45:15
JOHN WINSLADE Right, first of all sounds like they're going to have to talk to you first. 

00:45:20
 Yeah. 

00:45:20
JOHN WINSLADE Right? And say some things that are going to be encouraging, is it? 

00:45:25
 Yeah. Yeah. 

00:45:25
JOHN WINSLADE If I got that right? 

00:45:30
 I think so. 

00:45:30
JOHN WINSLADE So let me write it down as talk to him and say encouraging things. Thanks, Mattiya it's great. One more? Anybody else got another idea? 

00:45:45
 Well, I guess you could, if you have an idea, I guess you could like go home and help him with his homework or something if he needs help with his homework or something. 

00:46:00
JOHN WINSLADE Like, you check with them whether he need some help or ask him if he needed help. 

00:46:05
 Yeah. 

00:46:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So ask if he needs help and then help him with homework. Is that -- have I got that right? 

00:46:15
 Yeah. 

00:46:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. This is great. So we have five ideas. Now let's go through each one of them and see whose got to do each one of these things. Okay. And remember we are going to keep this undercover, so that nobody else know right. So sit with him at launch. Who might be able to do that? 

00:46:40
 I could. 

00:46:40
JOHN WINSLADE Mattiya, okay. Anyone else? 

00:46:45
 I guess, it we like too. 

00:46:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Xian and Katelyn, all on the same day or on different days? 

00:46:50
 We could all just, if that work. 

00:46:50
JOHN WINSLADE Whatever, okay. You can figure that out? 

00:46:55
 Yeah. We'll figure out. 

00:46:55
JOHN WINSLADE I don't want tell you guys how to do, you can bring -- undercover teams have to figure these things out, right. 

00:47:00
 Yeah. 

00:47:00
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Okay. Play with him after-school. That was one of your ideas, right? 

00:47:05
 Yeah. 

00:47:05
JOHN WINSLADE Anyone like to think about who could do something like that? Who would like to do that? 

00:47:10
 I can, if nobody will. 

00:47:15
 Yeah. 

00:47:15
 I can. I will. 

00:47:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. We've got Katelyn and Xian, again. 

00:47:20
 Sure. 

00:47:20
JOHN WINSLADE Anybody else? Not for you? You can't manage? Like you have to home, out of school or something. 

00:47:25
 Yeah. 

00:47:25
 Yeah. Okay. No, I get something to do after-school. 

00:47:30
JOHN WINSLADE You have something to do after-school. Okay. The next one was we've got two people for that anyway; compromise him when he gets a good grade, that was your idea, right. 

00:47:40
 I can do that. 

00:47:40
JOHN WINSLADE You can do that? You said, next term. 

00:47:45
 Yep. 

00:47:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, right. Anybody else able to do that? 

00:47:50
 I could. 

00:47:50
JOHN WINSLADE Mattiya. Somebody else, who was that? 

00:47:55
 I could. 

00:47:55
JOHN WINSLADE You could do that too, Katelyn. 

00:47:55
 Yeah, I kind -- I sit far away from him. 

00:48:00
JOHN WINSLADE And Xian as well, that's four of you. So he going to get four compliments. 

00:48:00
 I sit near. 

00:48:05
 Yeah. I sit kind of more towards front. He sits more towards the back. 

00:48:10
 I sit in like the middle, so. 

00:48:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. So let me ask you also to think about this, because I mean when you do this, you could be like over the top you of your say. Yeah, Ywyatt, great job. And that will -- you can be a little too obvious, right, everyone will get you're somehow into this thing. What? This is sort of weird, right. 

00:48:35
 Yeah. 

00:48:35
JOHN WINSLADE So you don't think about how you do this in a way that it isn't so weird and it isn't so obvious, but how would you do it. Any ideas? 

00:48:45
 Like when we walk out of class, like going into the next class we could just feel like, oh good job Ywyatt. Like good job Wyatt, as it is and thing. 

00:48:55
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, so just a little color of sneaky quiet. Can you do that, isn't? Let's we're going to try this? Yeah. Okay the next one was talk to him and say encouraging things, like that was kind of one of your ideas there. 

00:49:10
 Yeah. 

00:49:10
JOHN WINSLADE Like, are you willing to answer to that, doesn't it? 

00:49:15
 Yeah. 

00:49:15
 I could too. 

00:49:15
JOHN WINSLADE You could too, Sam. Okay. And once again, there is one law, you got to be kind of be careful not to do it too over the top, you got to do it carefully, nobody else really kind of gets that you're doing this. 

00:49:30
 Yep. 

00:49:30
JOHN WINSLADE Does that make sense. Anybody else? Where you doing all of these things to, Dawson. 

00:49:40
 Enough of much I could do, everybody else got this covered. 

00:49:40
JOHN WINSLADE Oh well then maybe something you can add to it. 

00:49:45
 You got anything remaining. 

00:49:50
JOHN WINSLADE Well, I'm asking whether you got anything in mind or. Okay. You think about it. You think about it. And one more thing you got on the list, and that is, ask him if he needs help and help him with his homework; anybody willing to try doing that? 

00:50:05
 Yeah, we could. 

00:50:05
 I could. 

00:50:10
JOHN WINSLADE You two can? Thank you. 

00:50:10
 Yeah. 

00:50:10
JOHN WINSLADE Thank you for being helpful. 

00:50:10
 So we're closer. 

00:50:10
 Luckily, we're near to his house. 

00:50:10
 So we could just close that stuff. 

00:50:10
JOHN WINSLADE So you know where he lives closest -- somewhat closer to you? 

00:50:15
 We are realistic closest. 

00:50:20
JOHN WINSLADE That's great. Okay. So you could ask him about that, right. 

00:50:20
 Yeah. 

00:50:20
JOHN WINSLADE Anyone else able to do anything to help with him? 

00:50:25
 No, I think -- I kind of live far away from him. 

00:50:30
JOHN WINSLADE A bit faraway. 

00:50:30
 No. 

00:50:30
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Okay. Thank you. And I really appreciate you being able to come here for just a little bit and talk about these things. Now, what's going to happen is this? I'm going to send you on your mission, right, you got a mission here, right, a secret mission. And I'm going to check with, first of all with Ywyatt, how it's going, after like a few days. I sit him, I talk to him on Monday, right. And then I'm going to also talk to you, maybe probably about Wednesday next week, and check how it's going from your point of view, right. And tell me if there is any things that you're seeing that are useful or successful or working or let's just compare notes and we can come back and if there is any, maybe, next week when we have -- you've got some other ideas, new ideas, that's fine and does that sound right? 

00:51:30
 Yeah. 

00:51:30
 Yeah. 

00:51:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Well, as I said, keep this seats out and I'll check back and then we see how it's going and if we're successful, remember I will try to give you some kind of reward all, for all of you, if the team is successful. Okay. 

00:51:45
 Yeah. 

00:51:50
JOHN WINSLADE Great. 

00:51:50
 Yeah. 

00:51:50
JOHN WINSLADE Thanks, everybody. We'll see you again, next week. Okay. Hi, Ywyatt, how are you doing? 

00:51:55
 Good. 

00:52:00
JOHN WINSLADE Good to see you again. And I said a week ago, last time we talk to you obviously and some having some problems, with the bullying that is going on. So I check with you again, so I want you to get back and see, because we -- how things are going and we did set up an undercover team. And they had a bunch of ideas about what they're going to see if they could help and make things better for you. And I want to just check with you what's it's been like for you since then, right. So tell me, what's being happening? 

00:52:30
 I feel like more social. 

00:52:30
JOHN WINSLADE Have they? 

00:52:35
 Yeah. 

00:52:35
JOHN WINSLADE Now, what do you mean? What are they doing? 

00:52:35
 They've been doing like; the girl, the two girls. 

00:52:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:52:40
 They like help me with sort of conference of a circle or like homework as I forgot how to like do the homework, so yeah. 

00:52:50
JOHN WINSLADE So, they help doing the homework thing. 

00:52:55
 Yeah. And then, a day later, well, actually they said we should walk to school and I planned out it's like me on a bench and walk to school. 

00:53:05
JOHN WINSLADE Really. 

00:53:05
 Yeah. And I walk to school. 

00:53:05
JOHN WINSLADE So that was an even more, because they got a list of things that they have planned to do, they listed that as well, right, some other idea. Okay. And what's that like for you? 

00:53:15
 It was good. I thought like this week I felt a less lonely. 

00:53:25
JOHN WINSLADE Less lonely, okay. 

00:53:25
 Yeah. 

00:53:25
JOHN WINSLADE That was one things that we're hoping when -- you feel less lonely right. So what about the bullying, does that happen or not. 

00:53:30
 No. Not at all. 

00:53:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Because the things that we're going on with that -- they were pulling you names, right, they were calling you -- all these we tend to write down here. And I don't want you to repeat, because those are nasty, right. 

00:53:40
 Yeah. 

00:53:40
JOHN WINSLADE But has that -- have any of those things happened? No. 

00:53:45
 But I'm like nervous, I think it might happen again. 

00:53:50
JOHN WINSLADE They might. Okay. So you're not quite sure, they're not going to bull you. 

00:53:50
 Yeah. 

00:53:55
JOHN WINSLADE But you're hoping that it ends, right. 

00:53:55
 Yeah. 

00:53:55
JOHN WINSLADE And they haven't -- in the last week it hasn't even happened, right. 

00:54:00
 Yeah. 

00:54:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Has anything else happened that might be worried? Does making you nervous or not? 

00:54:10
 No. Not really. 

00:54:10
 Nothing really has happened. You just not sure that's not the way -- there is only a week, right? 

00:54:15
 Yeah. 

00:54:15
JOHN WINSLADE  And so tell me what else? What else has happened that's not that bullying? 

00:54:25
 What is new? Like, everyone has a name but if it has... 

00:54:35
JOHN WINSLADE Mattiya, Sammy. 

00:54:35
 Mattiya. 

00:54:35
JOHN WINSLADE Sam, or Dawson or Cory, these are the four guys. Who was it? 

00:54:45
 I think it was Mat. 

00:54:50
JOHN WINSLADE Mattiya? 

00:54:50
 ...or Sammy. 

00:54:55
JOHN WINSLADE Sammy? Okay. 

00:54:55
 Sammy, yeah. He had a conversation along, like, Wyomies. 

00:55:00
JOHN WINSLADE Right? 

00:55:00
 Yeah. Like where it was lightens of, so. 

00:55:00
JOHN WINSLADE  So he you talk to you about that. 

00:55:05
 Hmmm. 

00:55:05
JOHN WINSLADE And what was that like? 

00:55:10
 It was what -- I felt like I got some like no people here or and they got to like no means. 

00:55:20
JOHN WINSLADE You're right. That's part of hesitant, because of the bullying thing, you're not getting that happen, right? 

00:55:25
 Yeah. 

00:55:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Okay. So you got to know people, they got to know you a little bit, does that make a difference, do you think you able to feel a little bit of things? 

00:55:35
 Yeah. 

00:55:35
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Probably... 

00:55:40
 Like I don't feel so lonely or... 

00:55:45
JOHN WINSLADE Right, okay. 

00:55:45
 Upsetting or, because no one's like been calling my names and the stuff. 

00:55:50
JOHN WINSLADE Right, okay. And that was those little things that were making you upset and feeling you lonely, right. 

00:55:55
 Yeah. 

00:55:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. I'm really pleased to hear that word. Does that feel much better for you? 

00:56:05
 Hmmm. 

00:56:05
JOHN WINSLADE That's really great. Really. Right. And you still a lot of nervous, that it might not be completely over but still you are feeling a lot better, right? 

00:56:15
 Yeah. 

00:56:20
JOHN WINSLADE One of the things you have said before was that you felt like you didn't want to go to school, right? 

00:56:25
 Yes. 

00:56:25
JOHN WINSLADE Has that been the same or better or worse? 

00:56:30
 Definitely changed. 

00:56:30
JOHN WINSLADE Definitely changed? 

00:56:30
 Yeah. 

00:56:30
JOHN WINSLADE Really! You are feeling much better back coming to school. That's fantastic. That's fantastic. I'm thrilled. 

00:56:40
 I'm not focused on like homework and stuff. 

00:56:45
JOHN WINSLADE Right, okay. And you have conference in the circle? 

00:56:45
 Yeah. 

00:56:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. That's cool. So is that affecting your school work, that's kind of things get better for you? 

00:56:55
 Yeah. 

00:56:55
JOHN WINSLADE Is it right in understanding that? 

00:57:00
 In speaking of which... 

00:57:05
JOHN WINSLADE Mattiya? 

00:57:05
 Mattiya. Like -- and Cory have -- they said, nice to me, they told me that I have good grades. 

00:57:10
JOHN WINSLADE Do they? 

00:57:15
 Yeah. They complement with me and my grades. 

00:57:15
JOHN WINSLADE Wow. Will that happened before? 

00:57:20
 Probably not. 

00:57:20
JOHN WINSLADE Probably not. Okay so that. Did they do that like sort of little embarrass you or they do it kind of appreciative or what? 

00:57:25
 I appreciate it. 

00:57:30
JOHN WINSLADE You did, right. Sometimes you could relate it, so you feel yap. But this wasn't like that. And okay, that's great. So what I'm telling is, it sounds right, and what I'm getting is that things are lot better that we soon need to just go for another week and so and to see -- faith better. 

00:57:55
 Yeah. 

00:57:55
JOHN WINSLADE Is that feel as a summary what you're saying? 

00:58:00
 Yeah. 

00:58:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, yeah. So I will talk to them and see that they kind of can say the same kind of thing, but unless they do and that's really great, this feels like that the undercover team is being helping, does that sound like -- that's true for you? 

00:58:15
 Yeah. 

00:58:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So I don't want to give them their reward just yet, because we need make sure that it's not just a fluke and that has really long, right. 

00:58:25
 Yeah. Because they like just do it again after. 

00:58:30
JOHN WINSLADE That's right. So you want to make sure that the change is really here to stay, right. So let's get another week and then I'll check with you again. And if it's true, if you're still feeling nervous and we might come back. Okay. 

00:58:40
 Hmmm. 

00:58:40
JOHN WINSLADE So thanks, Ywyatt. And one last question I just want to ask you, anything that you would suggest that you've learned from doing this? Any thoughts that you have about that or just curious about that? 

00:58:55
  Not really, but, well, it's torn as a little conference of a circle. 

00:59:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. I like that. You've really got learned that, right. You probably don't forget that right. 

00:59:10
 But -- yeah, it's taught me how to feel a little more social. 

00:59:20
JOHN WINSLADE Is it? 

00:59:20
 Yeah. 

00:59:20
JOHN WINSLADE Would you be a little more social now than you've been in the past. 

00:59:25
 Yeah. 

00:59:25
JOHN WINSLADE Really? 

00:59:25
 Definitely. 

00:59:25
JOHN WINSLADE Cool, right. 

00:59:30
 It's worked out by conversations, those things. 

00:59:30
JOHN WINSLADE Has it? Yeah. So it's not like they're just being more social with you, you've been more social with them too. It felt for me. 

00:59:35
 Yeah. 

00:59:35
JOHN WINSLADE Right, okay. Like they've been doing these things is kind of helped you to make reach out for them, somebody. 

00:59:45
 Yeah. 

00:59:45
JOHN WINSLADE I like it. Is it good for you? 

00:59:50
 Hmmm. 

00:59:50
JOHN WINSLADE Good, okay. I'm pleased about that. If it comes back, if the bullying come back would you come and tell me, because I'd like to know if it came back again. 

01:00:05
 Okay. 

01:00:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. What class is now? 

01:00:05
  I think, I'm in -- forgotten -- time is? 

01:00:15
JOHN WINSLADE Is it science again? 

01:00:15
 No, it's not science. 

01:00:20
JOHN WINSLADE You better know which class you're in actually, because you want long run, isn't it? 

01:00:25
 Now, I think it's Math. 

01:00:30
JOHN WINSLADE It's Math. 

01:00:30
 Now. 

01:00:30
JOHN WINSLADE And you're doing so many examples. 

01:00:35
 No, I don't think. I think we'll like moved on to different units. 

01:00:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Okay, right. Well, I'll let you back to whatever unit is, because you need to catch up that too, otherwise we have ask us to -- they help with your homework, again, right? 

01:00:45
 Yeah. 

01:00:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, okay. Well, go well, Wyatt. And as I said, I check out with you next week and hope these things are going well then. Okay. 

01:00:55
 Okay. 

01:00:55
JOHN WINSLADE See you then. Bye-bye. 

01:00:55
 Bye. 

01:01:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Well, thanks for coming back first, nice to see you all again and what I want to do is just tell what I got from talking to Ywyatt the other day, a couple of days ago and I want to check with you about how things are going, and I won't keep you too long, I bet. And so this is what Ywyatt told me, he was actually telling me that things were feeling a lot better for him. He said, people were being much more social and he knows that. He appreciate the fact that you two helped him with his conference problem. 

01:01:35
 Yeah. He called this up and he was like, I forget the, say, conference circle. 

01:01:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

01:01:40
  So he came to my house. 

01:01:45
JOHN WINSLADE So you actually worked on your homework and feel better. 

01:01:45
 Yeah. That's a lot better. 

01:01:45
JOHN WINSLADE Thank you for doing. That's great. And one of the other things that he said was, he appreciated the fact that several people given him compliments about getting a good grade, who is that? 

01:02:00
 Me. 

01:02:00
JOHN WINSLADE You did that, Mattiya? 

01:02:05
 I too. 

01:02:05
JOHN WINSLADE You did, Sam. 

01:02:05
 I was too far away. I couldn't see his papers, so -- I wanted to give him compliments, but... 

01:02:10
JOHN WINSLADE How do that happen, Mattiya? 

01:02:10
 Well, I said like, maybe two desks away from him and he got like a B or something on this test and I said, oh, nice job. 

01:02:20
JOHN WINSLADE Nobody else noticed. You just kind of suddenly gave it to him. 

01:02:25
 I think so. 

01:02:25
 I gave it to him first, because he got his paper first -- it was a B+ which was better than mine so. 

01:02:35
JOHN WINSLADE What did you say? 

01:02:35
 Good job. 

01:02:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. And what did he say? 

01:02:40
 He said, thanks. 

01:02:40
JOHN WINSLADE Good, thank you two, that's fair. And the other thing he mentioned that Sam you talked to him about, you had the conversation about being in Wyoming, like we were talking about that the other day. 

01:02:55
 Yeah. 

01:02:55
JOHN WINSLADE Well, how that gone? 

01:02:55
 Well, pretty well. 

01:03:00
JOHN WINSLADE What happened? What did you do for him? 

01:03:00
 I was just asking whether it was like how he likes this city compared to home. 

01:03:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Well, he appreciated that. Got it, Sam. Thank you for doing that? And so I asked him, what difference this is making? And he said, so far the bullying has not been happening; he is a still little nervous that it might comeback, but it hasn't been happening since we met last week and I really appreciate the fact that you've done a good job in that regard. And as I asked, what difference that make? And he said, I actually feel less lonely. What do you think of that? 

01:03:40
 That's better. 

01:03:45
 That's better. 

01:03:45
 Yeah. 

01:03:45
 Of course. He like isn't like always alone and... 

01:03:50
 Yeah. 

01:03:50
JOHN WINSLADE You're right. 

01:03:50
 We've been like passing him and saying hi and stuff. 

01:03:55
 And we've played after-school at my house. 

01:03:55
 Yeah, that's fun. 

01:03:55
JOHN WINSLADE Is it? Okay. So you've done even more than we talked about, you've been doing something like that in the home. 

01:04:00
 Yeah. I've been like, hey, what's up. 

01:04:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Anything else that's happened that you can tell me about? Well, anyway, the main thing is that, Ywyatt has said that he doesn't feel so lonely and he that doesn't feel like he doesn't want to come to school. And really appreciate the work that you've been doing. 

01:04:25
 And we walked to school? 

01:04:30
JOHN WINSLADE Did you, really? 

01:04:30
 Yeah we, we. 

01:04:30
 We all met up. 

01:04:30
JOHN WINSLADE You met up where? 

01:04:35
 Like the apartment. 

01:04:35
 Yeah. 

01:04:40
JOHN WINSLADE Right and then you walked all the way, because you lived not far away? 

01:04:40
 Yeah. 

01:04:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Okay. 

01:04:45
 That really like; my house, like house is like right next to each other. 

01:04:50
 Yeah. 

01:04:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Let me ask you this? Do you have any suggestions that you would like me to convey to Ywyatt. Anything that he could do could help him feel less lonely. Because sometimes you guys can come up with some suggestions like you think there is something there, Cory? 

01:05:10
 Oh, no, I want just like, something like, not be afraid to say something else. 

01:05:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. To not be afraid. 

01:05:25
 To speak out. 

01:05:25
JOHN WINSLADE To speak out, right. Okay. 

01:05:30
 Let's say guide the people. 

01:05:30
JOHN WINSLADE He could be a bit more of a guidance like other people. 

01:05:35
 Yeah. 

01:05:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:05:35
 And try to make more friends, because not everybody is going not like him at the school. Like, there could be more people who would want to be his friend if he try too, if he, like us. 

01:05:50
JOHN WINSLADE You would like to see him and try, right. 

01:05:50
 Yeah. 

01:05:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Try to make friends, okay. Now I'm going to talk him about, I'll pass those messages on, right. But what I'd like to do is, to just to check with him one more time like this time next week to see how this is going, right. So, okay? 

01:06:15
 Sure. 

01:06:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Okay, you are okay with that, Dawson. Great. And if this are going okay next week then what I will do is it, I'd just call you and give you your certificates. That sounds like you're really on target, this team is like another success story in the analysis of the undercover team. We've got one more success story and I'd really appreciate your help with this. And if I had somebody else in this situation, would any of you folks would be willing to do this again. Like? 

01:06:45
 Yeah. 

01:06:50
 We had a lot of fun. 

01:06:50
JOHN WINSLADE You had a lot of fun, right. 

01:06:50
 I would. 

01:06:50
JOHN WINSLADE You would do it again. And you're not answering, if we need -- I don't has to do this sort of thing. 

01:06:55
 I'd probably do.

JOHN WINSLADE You have to think about it, right. Okay. And one last question I want to ask, just sort of curiosity. I just understood what you've -- whether you've learned anything from doing this? Anything interesting for a while that you've learned from... 

01:07:20
 If somebody is like in trouble and you noticed you should probably like help them and like maybe talk to the person. It's like strategies that you found out didn't work, talk to the person... 

01:07:35
JOHN WINSLADE So, if someone is in trouble... 

01:07:35
 Yeah. And the person who is like being me or not like being cooperative with them, you can may be talk to that person. 

01:07:50
JOHN WINSLADE You can talk to that person, right. And here are the thoughts. Thank you, Katelyn. I appreciate that. Any other thoughts that you've learned from this. 

01:07:55

01:08:10

I'm just interested in keeping a note about this, because I need to be able to tell the principal, so these things you've been working, right, and this is useful to know that people are not only doing stuffs to make people happy but there is learning's from these experience, right. Anything you want to add Sam, you two. Anything you've learnt from this.
