Dr. JOHN ALLAN 

00:00:10
NARRATOR In these clinical series, we're allowed the privilege of seeing an initial play therapy session and experiencing the interaction between therapist and child. We recognize and applaud the courage of these play therapists in allowing us to videotape their spontaneous interactions with the child. In addition, viewers are afforded the opportunity to hear from each of the therapists as they share their impressions. These are not planned experiences. There is no script. They are spontaneous interactions that allow us a unique view into each therapist's typical approach to a child in play therapy. These play therapists were eager to share their experiences in hopes that you will learn about play therapy, children, and yourself. In this video you will see Doctor John Allan, a pioneer in Jungian analytical play therapy. Doctor Allan has long been recognized as one of the leaders in the conceptualization and development of the field of play therapy. He is professor emeritus of counseling psychology at the University of British Columbia, Canada, a senior training analyst with the Pacific Northwest Society of Jungian analysts and past board member of the Association for Play Therapy. Doctor Allan is a prolific writer and includes in his impressive bibliography of over 60 articles and 16 books such notable works as, "Inscapes of a Child's World," "Jungian Counseling in Schools and Clinics," and "Written Past to Healing," "Education and Jungian Child Counseling," with co-author Judy Bitraya. According to Doctor Allan, the goal of Jungian analytical play therapy is to activate the child's individualization process and to help the child develop his or her unique identity. Through this process, children can overcome or come to terms with loss and stressful events while accepting and adapting to the demands of life. Doctor Allan further explains how he works from an attachment model, involving the purposeful use of proximity to the child. 

00:02:30
UNKNOWN You wanna play? 

00:02:35
DR. JOHN ALLAN Sure. 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN  You know, I knew you had a different one of these that you know. 

00:02:45
DR. JOHN ALLAN Ah yes. 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN You wanna try it? 

00:02:50
DR. JOHN ALLAN Sure. 

00:02:50
UNKNOWN Okay bring this here for you. Okay, just watch me and what we do. I don't think I need the sound to play. 

00:03:05
DR. JOHN ALLAN I think we have to keep that on. 

00:03:05
UNKNOWN It's wide enough on me. 

00:03:05
DR. JOHN ALLAN It's slipping off you isn't it? Yeah, maybe if I can tighten it a little bit. Um, you think I can tighten it a little bit? Or what? Okay. There. See if that helps. 

00:03:25
UNKNOWN That helps. 

00:03:25
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. 

00:03:25
UNKNOWN Just watch me. I push it around like this. 

00:03:30
DR. JOHN ALLAN Ah. That's a big hit, isn't that? 

00:03:35
UNKNOWN Try that. 

00:03:35
DR. JOHN ALLAN You want me to hit that? 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN Just like this. But not that way. 

00:03:45
DR. JOHN ALLAN Not that way. 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN Like that. 

00:03:50
DR. JOHN ALLAN Like that. Okay. So you know how to hit it. 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN And now you know how to do it. 

00:03:55
DR. JOHN ALLAN That's right. You've shown me how to hit it. 

00:04:00
UNKNOWN Now you know how to do it. 

00:04:00
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right. 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN Are you gonna hit that thing? 

00:04:10
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. You really want me to hit that thing? Okay. Boom. 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Wow. 

00:04:15
DR. JOHN ALLAN Wow. Yeah. That was a big hit. Wasn't it? 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN How come it's made for water, not sand? 

00:04:20
DR. JOHN ALLAN Cause it just is. It's a teapot. 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN No it's not. It's a watering can. 

00:04:25
DR. JOHN ALLAN Ah. So yeah I guess it's made for water, not for sand. 

00:04:35
UNKNOWN  I'm pouring the sand out. It's getting heavy. 

00:04:50
[sil.] 

00:05:05
UNKNOWN So you need another hand, cause it's heavy. 

00:05:10
DR. JOHN ALLAN Now that's a lot of water. 

00:05:15
[sil.] 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN Now that's really a lot of water. 

00:05:25
DR. JOHN ALLAN That really is. Yeah. 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN How come it gets pushed when it's almost out of water? 

00:05:40
DR. JOHN ALLAN Yeah it doesn't pour so fast when it's almost out of water. That's it. 

00:05:45
UNKNOWN Why? 

00:05:45
DR. JOHN ALLAN Because I guess because there's less water in it. There you are. See at the start there's lots of water in there and it all pours out very quickly. And then when it gets nearly empty it just trickles out and there's no more water left. 

00:06:00
UNKNOWN Now when it's full, it goes out real... 

00:06:05
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right. So you're seeing a difference from when it's full and when it's empty. It pours differently, doesn't it? 

00:06:10
UNKNOWN Now this time it's gonna go in here. 

00:06:20
[sil.] 

00:06:30
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. We're all done. 

00:06:30
UNKNOWN All done. 

00:06:30
DR. JOHN ALLAN Yeah. 

00:06:35
[sil.] 

00:06:45
UNKNOWN Can you turn it off for me? 

00:06:45
DR. JOHN ALLAN Sure. 

00:06:50
[sil.] 

00:06:55
UNKNOWN Okay. Now where's the trash can? 

00:07:00
DR. JOHN ALLAN That's a good question, isn't it? Where do you think the trash can might be? 

00:07:05
UNKNOWN I don't know. 

00:07:10
DR. JOHN ALLAN Any idea? 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN  No. 

00:07:15
DR. JOHN ALLAN I don't know either. Cause this is the first time I've been in this playroom. 

00:07:20
UNKNOWN I know. I could just leave it right here. 

00:07:20
DR. JOHN ALLAN Yeah you could, yeah. 

00:07:25
UNKNOWN Okay, let's go back in the sand. We can bury some soldiers. 

00:07:30
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right. 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN Oh and here's a soldier truck which is missing some wheels. 

00:07:35
DR. JOHN ALLAN It is missing some wheels. 

00:07:40
UNKNOWN I guess it didn't have wheels before. I don't think it fits. How come soldiers just kill bad people and they don't kill good people? 

00:07:50
DR. JOHN ALLAN Yeah how come soldiers kill bad people and they don't kill good people? Right. 

00:08:00
UNKNOWN That's an apple. 

00:08:00
DR. JOHN ALLAN It's an apple? 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) soldiers. 

00:08:07
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN And I'll get a little one since I'm little. 

00:08:10
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right. 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN You have the big one and I have the little one cause we're... 

00:08:15
DR. JOHN ALLAN Cause I'm big, I have a big soldier. And because you're small you have a little soldier. 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN Okay let's get to work. Let's go. 

00:08:30
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. Wherever there's ex, wherever there is an ex, the soldier is there. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN Okay. Wherever there is a? 

00:08:45
DR. JOHN ALLAN Ex, the soldier is there. 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN The soldier's there. Okay. So that's how we know where the soldier is buried. 

00:08:55
[sil.] 

00:09:00
DR. JOHN ALLAN Wherever there is an ex, there is a soldier there. So you made an ex. 

00:09:05
UNKNOWN Now it's your turn. 

00:09:05
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. You'd like me to bury the soldier? 

00:09:15
UNKNOWN Do you need more sand? 

00:09:20
DR. JOHN ALLAN What do you think? 

00:09:20
UNKNOWN I think you need more sand. 

00:09:20
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. So I'll put more sand. 

00:09:25
UNKNOWN So the soldier won't show. 

00:09:25
DR. JOHN ALLAN  Right. Because if the big soldier's buried under a lot of sand, then he won't show. 

00:09:35
UNKNOWN And the little soldier is buried in a little sand. 

00:09:40
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. 

00:09:45
UNKNOWN Okay. Let's go. Okay. You buried, buried my soldier. Then I buried, you're supposed to put an ex. 

00:09:55
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay I've got to put an ex. So then we know where these soldiers are buried. Yours is buried there under an ex and mine is buried under an ex. 

00:10:05
UNKNOWN Okay. Who wants to start first? 

00:10:10
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay, you're wondering who's gonna start first. 

00:10:15
UNKNOWN Who wants to start first? Um, do you want to start first? 

00:10:20
DR. JOHN ALLAN Well actually, no, I'd like you to start first. 

00:10:20
UNKNOWN Okay. So you did then I did yours. 

00:10:25
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN Cause that's the deal. 

00:10:30
DR. JOHN ALLAN That's the deal. Right. 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN I put under my soldier. I need to unbury my soldier. 

00:10:45
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. It's your game. So how would you like to play it? 

00:10:50
UNKNOWN I want somebody to bury- this is how it goes. Somebody unburies somebody else's soldier. 

00:11:00
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay so once the soldiers are buried, then you unbury my soldier and I unbury your soldier. Is that how the game's played? 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN Uh huh. 

00:11:10
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. And you're wondering who's gonna go first. Who's gonna unbury the soldier first. You or me? 

00:11:20
UNKNOWN You. 

00:11:20
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay, you would like me to. Okay so. 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN Do you see an ex anywhere? 

00:11:25
DR. JOHN ALLAN  You know I think there's a soldier buried here somewhere and I just don't know. But I think I was told the code is underneath the ex a soldier is buried. Well, let me have a look. Can I see any mounds here? No. No, oh wait a minute. Hayla's saying there's a mound there. Let me climb up this mound. My goodness there's an ex here. So under the ex is a soldier buried there. Ah yes. Hi buddy, how are you doing? 

00:12:05
UNKNOWN Good. 

00:12:05
DR. JOHN ALLAN Oh yeah. 

00:12:05
UNKNOWN Now would you help me find my buddy? 

00:12:10
DR. JOHN ALLAN Sure. Would you help me find my buddy? 

00:12:10
UNKNOWN Yeah sure sure. 

00:12:15
DR. JOHN ALLAN Ah yes. So there's the ex. And there's the big soldier. 

00:12:20
UNKNOWN Let's do this game again. 

00:12:20
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. You like this game. But actually, wait a minute, Hayler, I want some help cause my soldier's not out yet. He's still buried. Look. So let's get him way out in the open. Hi buddy, how long have you been down there? 

00:12:40
UNKNOWN What? 

00:12:40
DR. JOHN ALLAN How long have you been buried, soldier? 

00:12:45
UNKNOWN For a long time. 

00:12:45
DR. JOHN ALLAN For a long time. Well it sure is good to have you out in the open. 

00:12:50
UNKNOWN  Okay let's play this game again. 

00:12:55
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. 

00:12:55
UNKNOWN Okay you bury yours and I'll bury mine. 

00:13:00
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right. 

00:13:05
[sil.] 

00:13:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) the soldier and say what you said. Do you remember what you said? 

00:13:35
DR. JOHN ALLAN Can I remember what I said? 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:13:35
DR. JOHN ALLAN I can and I think I can remember what you said is that in this game when the soldier is buried we have to put an ex on the mound. Okay. Because then when we're walking around and we see an ex on a mound, we know a soldier is buried there. 

00:14:00
UNKNOWN Um hmm. 

00:14:05
DR. JOHN ALLAN Thank you. 

00:14:05
UNKNOWN Now what are you supposed to say? Do you remember? Do you remember? 

00:14:15
DR. JOHN ALLAN Do I remember what I'm supposed to say? I think I'm supposed to say, I've gotta look for Hayla's soldier and if I come across a mound with an ex then there's a soldier buried under there. 

00:14:30
UNKNOWN Kay. Try my soldier. 

00:14:30
DR. JOHN ALLAN  Okay. So I should try yours okay. Let's see now then, I'm looking for Hayla's soldier and I think there is a mound somewhere, maybe under this bucket. No. No mound. Maybe, oh is that a mound? Yes it is but it doesn't have an ex so it's the wrong mound. Okay. My goodness, look at this big mound. It has a very big ex on it. Okay so now Hayla said I must start to dig when I see an ex. Okay. Dig together. Huh. There. There's a soldier. Hi soldier. 

00:15:10
UNKNOWN Hi. 

00:15:10
DR. JOHN ALLAN How are you? 

00:15:10
UNKNOWN Good. 

00:15:15
DR. JOHN ALLAN Where ya been? 

00:15:15
UNKNOWN Okay now let's go to the ex. 

00:15:15
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. Gonna go and look for another ex. 

00:15:20
UNKNOWN Okay. Let's shoot this man. 

00:15:30
DR. JOHN ALLAN Shoot the dirt away and there's the soldier. Hi soldier, how are you? 

00:15:35
UNKNOWN Okay. Let's bury these again. 

00:15:40
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. 

00:15:40
UNKNOWN Now let's, okay. 

00:15:45
DR. JOHN ALLAN So I bury the big soldier and you bury the little soldier. 

00:15:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. Cause I'm little and you're big. 

00:15:55
DR. JOHN ALLAN That's right. You're little and I'm big. So I have a big soldier. And because you're little, you have a little soldier. 

00:16:00
UNKNOWN Cause we're the same size. Cause we're the same size as the soldiers. 

00:16:05
DR. JOHN ALLAN  If we're the same size there's no... 

00:16:15
[sil.] 

00:16:20
UNKNOWN No what? 

00:16:20
DR. JOHN ALLAN I don't know. I'm just trying to understand what you said. So here I draw the ex on mine. Okay. 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN  Okay. Remember what you said? 

00:16:30
DR. JOHN ALLAN Um, so you're wondering if I remember the rules of the game and how it goes. 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN Uh huh. 

00:16:40
DR. JOHN ALLAN Yeah I think I do. I think I'm meant to go and look for Hayla's soldier. 

00:16:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:16:45
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. Um, okay so I've gotta go and look for Hayla's soldier. Where is Hayla's soldier? Oh, I think underneath here. No, that's not a mound. John, that's not a mound. Where, is that a mound? No. That's not a real mound. And let's see if I can remember. Yeah. Hayla said her soldier would be buried under a mound with an ex. Now I better climb up this little hill to see. Now where is an ex? There's a mound. There's an ex. Okay. I think that's it. Let's look. Let's dig. Okay. Let's dig. Well there's no soldier here. Right at the bottom of the mound is a soldier. Hi buddy, how are you doing? Nice to have you out in the open. 

00:17:35
UNKNOWN I'm gonna make a deep one now. (inaudible )There okay. Let's shoot this other mound. 

00:17:50
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay now it's Hayla's turn. Okay and I wonder how Hayla's gonna open up this mound. If she can find the mound. Can she find the mound? She's shooting it open. There. Got all the dirt off the mound. And who do we see underneath? 

00:18:10
UNKNOWN Soldier. 

00:18:10
DR. JOHN ALLAN The soldier. 

00:18:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. We love this game. Don't we?

00:18:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. Okay. Let's start. 

00:18:40
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay so you want me to start? 

00:18:50
UNKNOWN Sure. 

00:18:50

00:18:55
UNKNOWN I already buried mine. 

00:18:55
DR. JOHN ALLAN You've already buried yours. Yes. Or okay and now you want me to bury mine. And if I remember, if I bury a soldier I have to make an ex on the mound. And I remember another time you told me to make a bigger mound. Okay. 

00:19:15
UNKNOWN Yeah but how do I talk to the people that this fix this? 

00:19:25
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right. How can you talk to them? Yeah you're wondering. 

00:19:30
UNKNOWN I don't know. 

00:19:35
DR. JOHN ALLAN And if you could talk to them, Hayla, what would you say to them? 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN  Um, thank you for fixing this. 

00:19:40
DR. JOHN ALLAN Ah, you'd say thank you for fixing this. Okay. So because it feels a bit better for you. Right, so maybe when we end later on and you meet them again, you can say thank you for fixing this. 

00:19:55

UNKNOWN Do you remember? 

00:20:20
DR. JOHN ALLAN Yes, I remember. I remember. I have to make a big mound and then I have to put an ex on it. 

00:20:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. And remember what you said was this a soldier. 

00:20:30
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right. Then I remember I have to kind of walk around and look for the mound. Okay, a mound with an ex. Well there's a big mound. I wonder if it has an ex on it. Well I think I better climb this mountain and just see. And then I can look down. It's so big. Oh yes, it does have an ex on it. Okay. So that... 

00:21:00
UNKNOWN Kay, I want that soldier. 

00:21:00

00:22:40
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right okay. Start the game over. There was no soldier there after all. 

00:22:45
UNKNOWN Yeah it's so hard to find soldiers cause they're so fast. 

00:22:50
DR. JOHN ALLAN They move so fast. It's so hard to find them. 

00:22:50
UNKNOWN  Yeah. 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:05
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay, so the mound is being made and the ex has been put on. So the question is now, is there a soldier buried under there?

00:23:20
DR. JOHN ALLAN Well I don't know. Hayla what do you think? There is a mound over here. I mean I'm not burying a soldier now but there is a mound here and the mound does have an ex on it. So what do you think?

00:27:40
UNKNOWN Somebody's gonna have to help me though. 

00:27:45
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right. Yeah it's important for you to have someone help you with that. 

00:27:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, cause friends help each other. 

00:27:55
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right. Friends help each other. And you're feeling that I'm your friend right now. And we're going to help each other and we're gonna find the buried soldier. 

00:28:05
UNKNOWN Soldiers. 

00:28:10
[sil.] 

00:28:20
UNKNOWN Mound is really steep. 

00:28:20
DR. JOHN ALLAN Yours, your mound is really steep. Yeah, you want it to be steep. You want it to climb up the side, be a big steep mound. 

00:28:35
[sil.] 

00:28:40
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN And this is (inaudible ). You want to climb up and down. 

00:28:45
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. Climb up. Right. Do you remember the game? Yes, I remember the game. We have to look for a mound with an ex. And I have to climb up and look. Where is that mound? There, Hayla, there's a mound with an ex. Okay. 

00:29:10
[sil.] 

00:29:15
DR. JOHN ALLAN Get all the dirt off that mound, making the mound smaller and smaller and smaller. 

00:29:20
UNKNOWN Oh, I felt something. 

00:29:20
DR. JOHN ALLAN You felt something? 

00:29:25
UNKNOWN Let's dig, let's dig. But I see some green. 

00:29:25
DR. JOHN ALLAN Some green. It must be, it is. It's the soldier. 

00:29:35
UNKNOWN Let's watch what he can do. 

00:29:35
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right. Watch what he can do. 

00:29:40
[sil.] 

00:29:45
UNKNOWN Look what he did. 

00:29:45
DR. JOHN ALLAN Look what he did. 

00:29:50
UNKNOWN But I don't know what these wires are. 

00:29:50
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right, what is this wire coming out of the soldier? 

00:29:55
UNKNOWN What's in the soldier? Is this a wire that the soldier needs? 

00:30:00
DR. JOHN ALLAN  Right. You're wondering whether that's, that this wire that the soldier needs? 

00:30:10
UNKNOWN Um hmm. Why does he need this? 

00:30:10
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right. Why would a soldier need the wire? You're taking it off the soldier. 

00:30:15
UNKNOWN Nah, cause it's coming out. 

00:30:20
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right. It's coming out of the soldier, isn't it? 

00:30:25
[sil.] 

00:30:30
UNKNOWN Now this is gonna be a really deep one. 

00:30:30
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right. And do you know what, Hayla? I'm aware that our playtime is nearly over. And in a few minutes we have to go. 

00:30:40
UNKNOWN Now this is gonna be a really deep one. 

00:30:45
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. So this then will be probably the last burial mound that we'll do and you're gonna make it a really deep one because after that we have to leave the playroom. Our playtime is nearly over. Okay. You're burying the soldier? 

00:31:00
UNKNOWN Um hmm. Now who will help me bury it? 

00:31:05
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. You're wondering whether I'll help you bury it? You're finding all kinds of things in there, aren't you? Wire and a piece of cloth. 

00:31:15
UNKNOWN We don't need this. 

00:31:15
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right. We don't need it, do we? Okay, so you just wanna throw it away. Cause it's not part of our game. 

00:31:20
UNKNOWN  No. But this is gonna be a really steep one. 

00:31:25
DR. JOHN ALLAN That's right. It's important to build a really steep mound. 

00:31:30
UNKNOWN Why? 

00:31:30
DR. JOHN ALLAN  I don't know. You're wondering why. I guess you kinda like it. Don't you? You like the feel of it. You like the height of it. You like being able to build a steep mound. 

00:31:50
[sil.] 

00:32:15
UNKNOWN Okay. I'm almost done. 

00:32:15
DR. JOHN ALLAN Almost done. Okay. 

00:32:20
UNKNOWN Good. Just have two more sands. 

00:32:25
DR. JOHN ALLAN A few more bits of sand. You wanna make it as steep as you can. 

00:32:30
[sil.] 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN I can't get it to stay. 

00:32:55
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right. Yeah it's a bit frustrating. It won't stay up there, will it? You know what you want and it's... 

00:33:05
UNKNOWN Oh. 

00:33:05
DR. JOHN ALLAN Falling down. 

00:33:10
UNKNOWN I guess that's high enough. 

00:33:10
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right. 

00:33:10
UNKNOWN Just a little more sand. 

00:33:10
DR. JOHN ALLAN  Okay. One more, I think that's high enough. 

00:33:20
[sil.] 

00:33:25
UNKNOWN We can put it in a circle so we know where it is. 

00:33:30
DR. JOHN ALLAN That's right. So we're changing the sign from an ex to a circle so we know where it is. Okay. Hey, you know, Hayla's asked me to look for a soldier. And Hayla told me the sign and there's a mound and then a sign was an ex and then the sign was a circle. So I need to look either for an ex or a circle. Okay. And she did really want it to be in a steep area. So I'm gonna climb up and look down. There it is. There's an ex. That's where the soldier must be. Hey. Heyla. I think I found the mound. You wanna come and look with me? 

00:34:15
UNKNOWN Um hmm. 

00:34:15
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. We shoot the mound up. I don't see it. Do you see any little bit of green? Ah hah. I think you found him Hayla. There he is. Hi soldier. It's good to see you again. 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN  Okay then, um, then we maybe then put the first soldier to bed and then we'll bury the other soldier. Then he was right on the bottom. Then we're gonna bury them. Kay? Then he'll sleep again. Goodnight. 

00:35:15
DR. JOHN ALLAN Oh finish? Okay, so what, the soldier goes to bed then goes to sleep. And then it's time for us to go. And our playtime is over. 

00:35:25
UNKNOWN No. Then bury the other one. Then, 

00:35:25
DR. JOHN ALLAN Bury this one? 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN Then he had to eat lunch. Then woke up. Then we'll come back and play again. 

00:35:35
DR. JOHN ALLAN That's right. Yeah, you really like to come back and play again. It's kind of hard to leave when we're in the middle of a game. Isn't it? So Hayla why don't you help me find my soldier? 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN Okay. You put him. 

00:35:50
DR. JOHN ALLAN No I've already, Hayla look, you see I've already got one over here. I don't wanna leave this soldier buried, if you know what I mean. 

00:35:55
UNKNOWN Yeah I know. But first we have to put this soldier buried, then we have to take that one to lunch. 

00:36:05
DR. JOHN ALLAN Take that one to lunch? 

00:36:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:36:05
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. 

00:36:05
UNKNOWN Well not this one, that one. 

00:36:10
DR. JOHN ALLAN That other one for lunch. Right. Not those. Okay. Let's do it. Come and help me find my soldier. You know what, I think he's hungry and I think we need to take him for lunch because our playtime is over. 

00:36:20
UNKNOWN First we need to put this one to bed. 

00:36:25
DR. JOHN ALLAN Put this one to bed first? Okay. Where should we put him to bed? 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN I made a smooth spot. 

00:36:30
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. So let's make a little bed for him. 

00:36:35
UNKNOWN And this is the pillow. 

00:36:35
DR. JOHN ALLAN That's the pillow. Right. 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN And I'll make a blanket. 

00:36:45
[sil.] 

00:36:50
DR. JOHN ALLAN So we get him safely tucked into bed. Right? He's got his pillow. And are those his blankets? 

00:37:00
[sil.] 

00:37:05
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. Now, Hayla, that he's safely tucked into bed, will you help me find mine? Because I think I wanna take him for lunch. 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN The other one. It's bedtime. 

00:37:15
DR. JOHN ALLAN  Not that one. Cause that one is bedtime for that one. But for this guy, and our time is nearly up, very nearly up, so if you help me find my soldier and then we'll end the play and take him for lunch. 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:37:35
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. It's, 

00:37:40
UNKNOWN Okay. Where is the we want? Let's walk. 

00:37:50
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay let's walk. 

00:37:55
[sil.] 

00:38:05
UNKNOWN It has a bottom. 

00:38:05
DR. JOHN ALLAN Does he have a bottom? Is there really a soldier here? 

00:38:10
[sil.] 

00:38:15
DR. JOHN ALLAN Green. What do you think that is Hayla? 

00:38:20
UNKNOWN I think it's a soldier. 

00:38:20
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay. Okay so soldier, we're gonna have to put you back and we'll take you for lunch and then it's time for us to end our playtime. 

00:38:35
UNKNOWN But then after lunch we'll put him to bed. 

00:38:35
DR. JOHN ALLAN After lunch. Well you'd have to do that in your mind maybe with your mom. Because, what, you'd like to come back and play with me again? 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:38:45
DR. JOHN ALLAN Yeah. And I would like that too. 

00:38:50
UNKNOWN Kay. Then we'll take that one to lunch. After lunch we'll put him to bed. 

00:38:55
DR. JOHN ALLAN Put him to bed after lunch. Yeah. It would be really nice, wouldn't it? But we have to stop our playtime now. 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN How about this? I'll just put him to bed now. 

00:39:05
DR. JOHN ALLAN Okay, just put him to bed now and then after that we have to go Hayla. And it's kind of hard to leave, isn't it? And maybe you could play this game with your mom. 

00:39:15
UNKNOWN You mean today? 

00:39:15
DR. JOHN ALLAN Yeah. 

00:39:20
[sil.] 

00:39:25
UNKNOWN Can I just put him? 

00:39:25
DR. JOHN ALLAN Yeah. Just put him. 

00:39:35
[sil.] 

00:39:40
DR. JOHN ALLAN Right. So you're making a really nice bed. Getting the soldier really nice and cozy. So he's not actually, he's not buried now because his head is out. So his body is warm but his head is out. And he's gone to bed. Okay. I guess now it's time for us to go. 

00:40:05
[sil.] 

00:40:10
DR. JOHN ALLAN Make sure he's really cozy. 

00:40:10
NARRATOR The following are excerpts from an informal interview following the play session. Doctor Allan shares his impressions with Doctor Sue Bret, director for the center of play therapy at the University of North Texas. 

00:40:25
DR. JOHN ALLAN To me it was pretty normal kind of little girl play. I mean the question is when you introduce a stranger into her life in the playroom and at the same time she's being miked, how do you reduce the anxiety? How do you build a connection. From my perspective, I'm just trying to pull as much out of her as possible and trying to give her enough room. So if I interact with her, I'll interact a bit and then pull back, really just try to facilitate as much activity as she can share or do. It's slipping off you, isn't it? Yeah, maybe if I can tighten it a little bit. And then I had to kind of work with the fact that the mike wasn't fitting and she was a bit irritated. And so she was like involved in the play and then having to pay attention to the irritation. That's what I was trying to do, give her enough space in a way to kind of slowly slowly open up. So there's some kind of exploration of the room where she moves from one thing to another thing, which is really pretty normal. And part of this time she's trying to get used to this strange man in here. And I found her, you know, pretty healthy in terms of her secure attachment, in terms of her ability to relate. So she does some of the sand, and you know, she gets a bit irritated that it won't pour out. So she's wondering why doesn't it pour out and then she takes it out of the center part so she finds a way of like overcoming her frustrations. So really I found her pretty good in terms of getting frustrated and then mastering the frustration herself, being curious and then answering her own questions. 

00:42:15
UNKNOWN  How come it's made for water, not sand? 

00:42:20
DR. JOHN ALLAN So she then took the kind of tea part over to the sink and ran the water in and commented on things like oh it's heavy. So she's kind of exploring the relationship to the objects and finding out about okay then when it's full, it's heavy. Oh it pours differently when it's empty. So then she's really learning about the world and then she wanted to come over and do the main body of work, which is really the burying of the soldiers and the lifting of the soldiers out. And she's kind of trying to bring me into the play. And part of me is sometimes hesitant about playing because really I'm trying to create the space where their play comes. But I found okay, maybe if I work a little bit with her and back out, then she'll feel a bit safer or she'll feel she has a relationship so she's kind of wanting a relationship with me. A friend. So I'm saying, "Yes I'm your friend. And friends play with each other." And then she goes through some of the, kind of the just the learning situations. Ex marks the spot. And so you build a mound, you gotta build a mound, you gotta build it bigger, and then ex marks the spot and then her activity level increased a bit as she dug with a soldier. Then she started to shoot. So that's something that's to me is a positive sign in terms of building up her activity level within the play. And then there's the whole construct of what is the burial and the resurrection about? And in certain ways that's kind of normal emotional constancy kind of work which is their task, a child's task to feel secure inside. And you have to know that things disappear from view but you know where they are and you know how to find them. And then you can lose sight of them. So you lose kind of visual proximity but you have internal proximity. Yeah I know where to find it, ex marks the spot, I dig it up. So a lot of kind of what I would see is pretty normal kind of repetition really in a way. Yeah the question in my mind is at this age should she still be playing that object constancy kind of game. But I spoke with the mum outside of the session and the mum had told me that the relationship with the father, the marriage and the relationship kind of ended, I think at about a year and a half. And then he was a good player with her that he was involved with her and then he slowly moved to another town and then hasn't really been involved with Hayla since December the 13th. So I'm thinking about as I'm doing the work, what does this mean to her. And usually this stuff gets buried deep in the unconscious of the child and then they relate and move into another world. And there is this kind of question inside about unconsciously where is he, what happened. And this stuff may not show consciously. So I'm thinking is some of this maintenance of the image of the father still present in her mind and how does even the unconscious image of the father stay present or how does she have access to it. So in a way she's kind of working that piece in the play of something being buried and being found. And what was really fascinating was Sue at the end, you know she didn't want the play to end. It was like she could've gone on forever. Which is a positive attachment sign. You know like I enjoy playing with you, don't leave me, let's keep on playing. So the desire for a relationship with the male is still very much present in her. And I watched her with the mum and she's very healthy, affectional, playful with her own mind and saying what's going on in her. And at the end the soldiers weren't buried. Their heads were on a pillow and their bodies were covered like with a blanket so that what was kind of invisible actually can also be visible. So in a way that's a slight kind of developmental shift. I think it's very important because actually it's a very positive sign of attachment. It's a very positive sign of relationship. It's like saying John I want a relationship with you. Be my friend. Friends play together. I think she said that somewhere along. And friends share back and forth. And this is an important developmental task that this is not parallel play that she's involved in. It's reciprocal play. And so she wants me to be part of it. As a child sent to therapists with the union orientation and I'll sometimes pull back a little bit because I want more of this externalization from the child. But really the starting point is to play along with them and be engaged with them. But not dominate or lead too much. So I could do a little bit of leading. But when I led I tried to bring her into the play. And I tried to amplify the play a little bit. Okay well let's look for him. Where would he be? Oh there's a mound. I have to climb up here. So I'm trying to kind of amplify the play a bit, extend it, extend it a little bit. And would be responsive to her needs. So she's saying play with me, yeah okay I will play with you. And really working out an attachment model that involves proximity. And because this is the first session, then I'm going to stay close if I'm feeling that that's what the child is wanting. And it seemed, yeah, she wanted kind of proximity to me. So I would move around and be close so that if she wants to engage me and wants me in the play, then I'm there to kind of engage. It's kind of the thin line between am I as a therapist being too intrusive or am I being too distant? And I'm trying to find what is the right space, both physically and emotionally and in the play too. 

00:49:00
SUE BRATTON John, I was curious about her shift from digging to shooting the mounds to unbury the soldiers. 

00:49:05
DR. JOHN ALLAN  Yeah, I thought about that internally. Is this anger shooting? Or is this just more of an assertive way to open up the mound to release the soldier? And part of my thinking was okay encourage the shooting by imitating her, rather than switching it up into a cognitive level and asking a question or even reflecting about the shooting. What I was interested in was kind of getting more activity out of her. Or more kind of expressiveness out of her. So that was my thinking about the shooting. Unconsciously is she mad at the father? Does she want to shoot the father for not being in her life? 

00:50:00
UNKNOWN You wanna play? 

00:50:05
DR. JOHN ALLAN Sure. 

00:50:05
SUE BRATTON John, is there anything you'd change about today's session? Or anything else you'd like to comment on? 

00:50:10
DR. JOHN ALLAN I felt okay about it in the sense that I talked in my theoretical model about the entrance phase of play therapy. And in the entrance phase there's a lot of flitting around from thing to thing. 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN Like that. 

00:50:25
DR. JOHN ALLAN Like that. Okay. And in the entrance phase she bopped the bobo and she wanted me to bop it and I didn't bop it right away cause what I was really hoping is that she would bop it more. And she did. But then she came back to me, okay now you hit it. So I whopped it and actually whopped it quite hard. And I think she was a bit surprised. Wow, you really hit it. Okay. Boom. 

00:50:50
UNKNOWN Wow. 

00:50:50
DR. JOHN ALLAN This would be a question for me in her work, is really how does the aggression over the abandonment by the father come out? Does it need to come out? Yeah, yeah. At some point it would need to hers and the anger probably would need to come out. But the timing of it has to really follow her timing and she's moving developmentally very appropriately. So I had a bit of time with her and the mum in another playroom outside. And appropriately affectionately, she's kind of moving ahead. And then I was really glad that she actually moved into the soldier kind of burial play. It's a girl growing up in a family of women, mother, grandmother, some grandfather involvement, not as much. And so she's attracted to the soldiers, to the males. And this is of course the missing element in the family, is the father. So loss and recovery, you see. So I think symbolically she's working with say the loss of father and the recovery. And it's also a normal developmental task about missing things and then having them come back to life or to be present. And so she's found a way to find what is lost, to keep it alive and that last little bit of them sleeping in the bed with the head not buried is really a good sign of this slow developmental progress on the way to keep herself healthy. And she is healthy.
