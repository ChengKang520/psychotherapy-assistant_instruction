00:00:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hi, welcome. 

00:00:40
BRENDA Hello. 

00:00:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Brenda, I'm right? 

00:00:40
BRENDA Yes. 

00:00:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And Gina? 

00:00:45
GINA Yes. 

00:00:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Right. Ah… Thank you for coming along. Have you ever been to anything like this before, any kind of mediation situation? 

00:00:50
BRENDA No. Not professionally. 

00:00:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Not professionally? 

00:00:55
BRENDA No. 

00:00:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay and how about you? 

00:00:55
GINA Same. 

00:00:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Ah… So this is a, a new experience for you? 

00:01:00
GINA Yes. 

00:01:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… and I'm interested I guess in what brought you to decide to come to this new experience. 

00:01:05
Explaining mediation and the mediator's role 

00:01:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE But just before we get into that, hmm, I just want to be clear about what we, what we're here to do and ah, my, you know what I can offer by way of ah, assistance, because I see my role is basically assisting you work your way through whatever is important to you both… 

00:01:25
GINA Hmm… 

00:01:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE …so that you can move forward in which, whatever is important to you. I mean, I only know a little bit at the moment about what the issues are between you and I need you to tell me about those in a minute. But as I said, my role is not to be a judge. I'm not here to decide or to make decisions, you want that, that someone to that, that's what the court is for. 

00:01:45
GINA Yeah. 

00:01:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE But I'm guessing that you came here because you wanted something different from that and I guess what I would like to offer is the chance for you to work out, where you're gonna go with this yourselves and make your own decision so, you can hmm, work with or come to your own understandings, not, not always decisions or come out of these meetings, sometimes you just people learn to understand each other's hmm, positions a little more and their concerns, and so on… understand. How does that sound? 

00:02:20
GINA It's sounds great. 

00:02:20
BRENDA Ah, yes exactly that's what we need. 

00:02:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is it? 

00:02:25
BRENDA Yes, Hmm. 

00:02:25
Discussing confidentiality 

00:02:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… so, Hmm… I am not going to, hmm, speak about anything that we talk about here to anybody else, right. I, I mean, it's all confidential except in the rare circumstance where someone is likely to be harmed or something like that. Hmm… but I just want to check with you as anyone else involved in the sort of ring within which you want to keep things in confidence? 

00:03:00
GINA I'm just had a (inaudible ) with my family like my ah, my son and my husband. 

00:03:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… well that's up to you two to decide. I mean you, you would like, you would like that? 

00:03:10
GINA Umm… actually I think it would just be better if it is, it's between you and I. 

00:03:20
BRENDA In a way, in a way it does involve the rest of the family. 

00:03:20
GINA Okay. 

00:03:20
BRENDA So, I'm… 

00:03:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Meaning who? 

00:03:25
BRENDA For her family, I mean it just, it's a family matter it sometime involves a family. 

00:03:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE You don't, you don't have any problem with Gina sharing what we talk about with… 

00:03:35
BRENDA No. 

00:03:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE What's your husband's name? 

00:03:35
GINA Josh. 

00:03:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Josh okay, with Josh. 

00:03:35
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:03:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And is there anyone else do you have any partners or? 

00:03:40
GINA No. 

00:03:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Any other people you live with are important to you? 

00:03:40
BRENDA No. 

00:03:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE No. So, is that, is that what, what we're saying is that, this will be confidential between us you two and I and Josh. 

00:03:50
GINA Yes. 

00:03:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Unless there is some reason for, for her to go further than that, which would only be in those exceptional circumstances. 

00:04:00
GINA Okay. 

00:04:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:04:00
BRENDA Umm… 

00:04:00
Groundrules are negotiated rather than imposed 

00:04:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Umm… any other sort of safety issues or, or guidelines that you would like to put in place that would help us to go as the way you wanted to go. 

00:04:15
GINA Safety issues. 

00:04:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, like sometimes people are concerned with, you know, hmm… ruling out some ways of speaking is being off limits or, you know. 

00:04:30
GINA I see. 

00:04:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE You know, sheltering or no… 

00:04:35
BRENDA Name calling. 

00:04:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Name calling, that kinda of stuff right. 

00:04:35
GINA Hmm… hmm… 

00:04:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE What do you, what do you thinking, what would you, what would make it okay for you to have a good conversation? 

00:04:40
BRENDA I think, yeah just keeping the voices down. 

00:04:45
GINA Hmm… hmm… 

00:04:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, voices down and you agreed on that. Anything else? 

00:04:55
GINA Ah… basically that I think we've had a problem with that in the past. 

00:05:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Really, yes. 

00:05:00
GINA Where we would yell over each other and we didn't accomplish anything, so we're just in a single tone. 

00:05:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So you'd like something different than that. 

00:05:05
GINA Yeah, so we can listen to each other. 

00:05:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, one of the guidelines for our conversation was be that it would involve listening and keeping voices down. 

00:05:15
GINA Yes. 

00:05:15
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:05:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is that right for you? 

00:05:15
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:05:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Anything else? 

00:05:20
BRENDA I think also talking. 

00:05:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Talking? 

00:05:25
BRENDA Because I think anywhere, we're not, we're ignoring the problem of not talking. 

00:05:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, it's important to address and talk about the problems that. 

00:05:30
BRENDA Yes. 

00:05:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Ah, here. 

00:05:35
BRENDA Yes. 

00:05:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Okay. Anything else? 

00:05:40
GINA Hmm… maybe ah, can we validate each other's feelings. Would it ever get to that point, let's hope so, but, umm, I think there will be… 

00:05:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So there, there're strong feelings that you are feeling need to be validated between you? 

00:05:55
GINA Yes. 

00:05:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE How does that sound to you? 

00:05:55
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:05:55
Hopes for the conversation are first elements of a counter story 

00:05:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Hmm, the question I was gonna just ask is about you know, what you're hoping for out of this conversation and I guess you’re starting to speak about that. There will be a kind of conversation where people would listen to each other. They would talk about the important issues and they'd validate each other's feelings. Anything else that you'd be hoping for? 

00:06:25
GINA We would learn how to communicate, coz I don't think we've ever learnt how to communicate. 

00:06:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Really? 

00:06:30
GINA Hmm. 

00:06:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE You're gonna say something? 

00:06:35
BRENDA I would say, pertaining to this particular issue that we can kinda come to resolution here and not have to take it to where as to court that we can resolve it amongst ourselves, as you know these kind of family issue and I think that we, it's important that we resolve it between ourselves. 

00:06:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so there is a need for the kind of communication that we've described and there is also a need to resolve some things? 

00:07:00
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:07:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is that fair enough? 

00:07:00
GINA Yes. 

00:07:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is that what you're saying? Do you agree with that? 

00:07:05
GINA Yes. 

00:07:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Great. Anything else? 

00:07:10
GINA That's what I could think of right now, I think it would be a great starting point for us. 

00:07:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, okay. And you may think of some other things along the way. 

00:07:20
GINA Umm. 

00:07:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Umm… I don't… if there is no other questions that you have, are you ready to a sort of get into the issues and talk about what's been happening and what's brought you to be here today. 

00:07:30
The issues have brought them here - externalizing 

00:07:30
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:07:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE You're ready to do that? 

00:07:35
GINA I think so. 

00:07:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, I don't know, who would like to go first rather we like to start and coz I mean this clearly as I understand it's something to do with the death of your mother and the will that she left, that's kinda of somehow left some differences between you. But am I right, is that, is that, those are the issues that we're here to talk about today. 

00:07:55
GINA Hmm… hmm… Yeah. 

00:08:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yes? 

00:08:00
BRENDA Yes. 

00:08:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:08:00
GINA Yes, a will my mother had passed ah, a month ago and it just everything started sort of the thing as far as our relationship, our relationship started I guess dying at that point like it. 

00:08:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:08:15
GINA It's so (inaudible ) anyway. Umm… what happened was is that after the funeral, we sat down with our, our attorney and we… the attorney discussed the will and that's when we started fighting and I kinda got really upset during that meeting, what happened is that our mother had left the house and instead of splitting it 50-50, it was split 60-40 and other… 

00:08:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:08:50
GINA …ah, assets weren't split in my point of view fairly. 

00:08:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm. 

00:08:55
GINA And so ah, that's what happened, that's why we're here today so this… 

00:09:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And do you've any other siblings or other I mean between? 

00:09:00
GINA No. 

00:09:00
BRENDA No. Just two sisters. 

00:09:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Just two of you okay, all right. So that was the start of things, but you also said that you haven't communicated well in the past. You haven't learned how to communicate. Is that right? 

00:09:15
GINA Umm… that is true. 

00:09:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, is this, this the issues that have arisen here go back, I mean do they go back further or not? 

00:09:20
GINA I would say so. I believe… 

00:09:20
BRENDA I was in different lifestyles in general, different personalities, lifestyles, and… 

00:09:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Different lifestyles, okay. 

00:09:30
BRENDA Well… 

00:09:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Can you tell me what you mean by that? 

00:09:30
Curiosity about the personal meaning of ordinary words 

00:09:35
GINA Like she was the fun one and she has funny career. She gets to explore the world and do all those fun stuff and I feel like, I'm the more responsible one, took care of mom during her last months here on earth… 

00:09:45
Positioning each other around the word "responsible" 

00:09:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:09:50
GINA So… 

00:09:50
BRENDA She is… 

00:09:50
GINA I've taken that role and so… 

00:09:50
BRENDA And a typical stay-at-home mom and I'm more a non-typical working, not married, don't have children. 

00:09:55
GINA Yeah. 

00:09:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:10:00
GINA Hmm… hmm… 

00:10:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:10:00
BRENDA And we didn't call it less responsible. 

00:10:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE What would you call it? 

00:10:05
BRENDA Like I said it's just different ways of living. 

00:10:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, are there some important things, some things that are important to you in the way that you live is that what you're saying, you mean. 

00:10:15
BRENDA Yes, absolutely. 

00:10:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Tell me a little bit more about that. 

00:10:20
BRENDA Well, just I don't women's place is necessarily being, just to have kids and be a mom and there is a lot of women, they don't fit that role and, umm you know I mean just, there is just differences and I think it's just kinda playing out here as far as who has seen as more responsible, and who has seen as more irresponsible, and which is affecting, yeah she, I guess is thinking that the will is unfair and… 

00:10:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… okay. So, in response to those ideas that are have always been around about how women should be. 

00:10:55
BRENDA Hmm… hmmm… 

00:10:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE You've wanted to take a different line. 

00:11:00
BRENDA Yes. 

00:11:00
Deconstruction of gender discourse 

00:11:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

00:11:00
BRENDA Yes. 

00:11:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And, it, it sort of involved you in a, a lifestyle that's ah, easily called or, or has been called irresponsible. 

00:11:10
BRENDA Hmm… Hmm… 

00:11:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE But you wanting to see it in a very different way right now. 

00:11:15
BRENDA Hmm… Hmm… 

00:11:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And… 

00:11:15
GINA And I want to take my role as trying to I think it, it did stand back from childhood like you always, mom always seem to favor you and that's how I feel, it's kinda shown here in the will that our mother had favored you over me and here I was trying to you know, have her appreciate me, working hard accomplishing what I have, maybe my, my seeking to motherhood was a chance for me to get my feelings validated, because it's hard to communicate with her and how she is with our mother and… 

00:11:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… 

00:11:55
GINA …so, over the time, I think it is just umm… poor communication and I mean, our different lifestyles really will be play a part in that. 

00:12:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Are you saying that when you're younger, ah, how your… your mother to you seem to favor Brenda was quite hurtful, quite it was, quite a powerful emotional effect on you? 

00:12:15
GINA Umm… definitely, definitely I tried to, then up to last six months. I, I stayed with her and I moved out of my apartment with my husband and my son and moved into the house, she was really ill and so, ah, watched over her, I even quit my job as a teacher… 

00:12:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… 

00:12:35
GINA Just to stay at home and I thought maybe that can earn me some validation points. I'm not too sure, I just wanted to show her that I cared and I wanted to see that back and when I wasn't… 

00:12:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE You wanted something from her? 

00:12:50
GINA Yeah and whether it maybe she was too ill to show that she cared, but she could have at least showed me that she cared by splitting the home 50-50. 

00:13:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So that's part of the background of how come you felt so upset at the time when you heard the will, is that right? 

00:13:05
The conflict story is the relationship story that has produced the conflict 

00:13:05
GINA Definitely. 

00:13:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:13:05
GINA Definitely, even in the will, it also left a painting and she, my mother, our mother gave her as it been gave Brenda, a painting, which to me it symbolized my relationship with my mother. I'm the first born. It was a mother with child and so, I felt as if that would've belong to me. It isn't expensive painting, but money is irrelevant to the symbolism in it, but Brenda got that and so I just feel like something works about 50-50. 

00:13:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So that felt unfair to you? 

00:13:40
GINA Definitely. 

00:13:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… was there anything else in the will that was, you said there was several things as well as the house. 

00:13:50
GINA So, she got the 60% and I got 40. She got the painting and I got other things such as jewelry and ah dishes… 

00:14:00
BRENDA All furnishings of the house. 

00:14:00
GINA Yeah, but that to me it's not that like meaningful, I wanted something more and so, if I can't validate my feelings through my mother anymore, I can talk to my sister and hopefully and but it hasn't be able to be done yet. 

00:14:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:14:20
GINA But… 

00:14:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And tell me about what happened, I mean hearing Gina's experience of the reading of the will and the things that were, ah, that happened from her point of view, but tell me about what, what that was like from your point of perceptive, Brenda? 

00:14:35
BRENDA I mean, it's hard to see that you've been hurt and that you know, you know I mean that what’s up to be, you know feel like your mom favors the other daughter, but it just, it's hard for me the kind of you know how is that, relevant to our relationship. You know, I thought it might have been your relationship with mom, but it's unlike, it's kinda I don't understand what you want to me to do about it. You know, I thought that was between you and mom, not between us. 

00:15:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So what was it like for you when you heard the will. And what was in it? 

00:15:15
BRENDA Umm… I mean aside from, you know the loss of our mother it's. 

00:15:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Umm… I mean it's clearly was a, a tender time for both of you. 

00:15:25
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:15:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is that right, I mean at the time your mother died and that's to be. 

00:15:25
GINA Hmm… hmm… yeah. 

00:15:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So it had that painfulness about her? 

00:15:30
BRENDA Yeah, I mean aside from that like it was just kind of that's, I mean the will or something that somebody like that what they want and to regardless of what is in it and what's said in that and that's it was their choice of what they wanted in the will and I had realized how umm…, you know what impact it had on you as far as you know, the other, you know, your feelings about the relationships between all of us and you know I had, you know, you kind of mention something with, you know when we heard it, but that was it and I had tried calling and there is no answers and so this is really the first time I had been hearing about that you know, that there is more behind it. You know, how upsetting it is for you and… 

00:16:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, you're kind of shocked or taken a back or… 

00:16:20
BRENDA Yeah… 

00:16:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE When Gina was so upset… 

00:16:25
BRENDA Yeah, because we really haven't talked since, the first, you know when we heard about the will and there is you know, she briefly made a rude comment, and, ah… 

00:16:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Umm… So, what got on the way if you not talking further. 

00:16:40
A question that prefigures externalizing 

00:16:40
BRENDA I don't know, I had tried calling and my phone calls are not returned. My e-mails are not returned and… 

00:16:50
GINA Basically, I just didn't feel like, I was up to, I guess befriending my sister, because to me I just didn't feel like it was fair and it wasn't fair and here is what it was to that umm, I was able to investigate the revision of our will our… our mother's will and I discovered that there were changes made with the last six months of her life and so, to me, ah, as soon I started living there and maybe things could've been changing, of course our father had died about few years passed, but that's when they, they started the will in the first place and so, to have the revision only six months ago. I don't know, she talks to our mother over the phone or she had, I don't know if she was convincing our mother… 

00:17:40
BRENDA Umm… 

00:17:45
GINA …in some way to change the will, because to me I was helping out mom and I just felt like I deserved more than what I got and so, it's not fair and to me I just wanted to investigate further and I just had a hard time kinda trusting you, right now. 

00:18:00
BRENDA It's just upsetting to me that you know, first of all you've gone already, you kinda behind my back from investigating, so that coming to me first and that now you're accusing me that I don't know somehow I was convinced mom about what to put in her will and that's made, I think I don't know like how are we able to communicate when I can't get a whole view and you don't come to me first setp and… 

00:18:25
GINA Well it is hard. It's hard to befriend a sister that mom treated better and obviously she treated better with giving her… giving you a lot of important stuff and I've hard time communicating with her in the past and right now, we're, we're very civil, but ah, and that's probably the best idea to have you sit here and help us. 

00:18:50
BRENDA Umm… 

00:18:50
GINA Umm… but you know, I wasn't ready to talk to you. 

00:19:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Umm… So, there has been this, like a standoff for the last, how long, a month? 

00:19:05
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:19:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is that more than that or since… 

00:19:05
BRENDA No, about a month. 

00:19:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And. 

00:19:10
BRENDA The more in her part because, I've tried in communicating. 

00:19:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE You've tried, okay. 

00:19:15
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:19:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Hence I mean, this, this whole issue sounds like it's quite had a powerful effect on each of you and on your relationship. 

00:19:30
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:19:30
Externalizing the conflict story Naming the problem 

00:19:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Ah, what would you call it, I mean is it a I mean, would you say… 

00:19:35
GINA As far as… 

00:19:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE I mean, would you say is it an argument or conflict or difference or tension or what is that. 

00:19:40
GINA Oh, may be tension. I think tension. 

00:19:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Tension? 

00:19:45
BRENDA I would say conflict too, because there was just a lot of conflict between our interests and just kind of… 

00:19:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Such. 

00:19:50
BRENDA …there is a lot of conflicts between our two lives and that just you know, kinda make us about heads all the time to her. 

00:20:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, it's kind of to do with lifestyles and, and conflict but it’s also to do with, umm, the tension that's been added to because of the will. 

00:20:05
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:20:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And the conflict between you about that. You're not sure. 

00:20:10
BRENDA Why does there is, for me I don't have so much, I mean the will if it stays how it is, I've got, and you know how, too much, there is not, so much tension from me about the will. I think that's more. 

00:20:25
GINA Yeah. For me of course… 

00:20:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So that's, that's something, the will is something that's affected you more than it's affected you Brenda right? 

00:20:30
BRENDA Yes. 

00:20:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE But you've got some other concerns about things that are affecting you. 

00:20:35
BRENDA Yeah, about our relationship. 

00:20:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, umm… 

00:20:35
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:20:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So what's affected you. Tell me, you know, how this whole situation that you've described, how it's have been affecting you personally. 

00:20:45
Mapping the effects of the conflict 

00:20:45
BRENDA Well, just that not, I mean, not feeling trusted, you know, and she doesn't, hasn't trusted me… 

00:20:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… 

00:20:50
BRENDA Umm… and another thing that had happened that a kind of spark does coming to you is and it had been on her son's birthday and I, I found out about it through a family member that there was a birthday party and I haven't been invited and this was going on during the time that we haven't been speaking, but I mean, Grenal(ph) it's my nephew and you know, so that really affected me a lot, just kind of not being involved or not being ah, trusted and just kinda… 

00:21:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Sort of shutout. 

00:21:25
BRENDA Being, yeah shutout and being seen as responsible and then being seen as not deserving of things and you know, really not been valued as sister, you know, it's affected me. 

00:21:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, that's been the effect of this relieves you feeling not valued. 

00:21:40
Externalizing effects to the conflict, not persons 

00:21:40
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:21:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And puts you in the place of what's called irresponsible. 

00:21:45
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:21:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Like that's what this whole thing does. 

00:21:45
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:21:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE This whole conflict or this whole situation. 

00:21:50
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:21:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:21:50
BRENDA Yep. 

00:21:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Anything else, I'm coming to ask you the same question a second. Anything else to this whole situation has been doing. 

00:21:55
BRENDA It's really and it seems kind of petty to me that, you know I mean I've heard a lot of the people are fighting of their wills and stuff like that, but it actually being in that position is really, it's kind of embarrassing and umm… 

00:22:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. How is it, I mean that's, that's the sort of emotional response so, is it having any other effects, I mean on your, I don't know, your health, wellbeing, finances, relationships, anything else. 

00:22:25
BRENDA Umm… well, like stress. 

00:22:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Stress? 

00:22:30
BRENDA Yeah, to them… you know, I'm in the middle trying to start a little business and ah, you're not having really any support, you know because, my parents were passed and you know my sister and you know, not having that support and so just adding stress. 

00:22:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:22:45
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:22:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And sounds like it's a stressful time in terms of the business anyway, right. 

00:22:50
BRENDA Yeah. Oh, yeah. 

00:22:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Anything else? 

00:22:50
BRENDA No. That's funny. 

00:22:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay, that it sounds petty, yeah. 

00:22:55
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:22:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So what's the whole thing being doing to you Gina. 

00:23:00
GINA Well, I, I agree stress definitely. Umm… 

00:23:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Stress for you too? 

00:23:05
GINA Yeah. I quit my job to take care of our mother and, and it is so that I expected more than what I got, but now, we have to move and I don't know, the biggest thing is we would end everything, we would end all conflict between each other if the will was split fairly, but I've a hard time talking with her in the past and so that's why this time, I just want to take it up with somebody, who can, my attorney or somebody that can help out split it fairly. 

00:23:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:23:40
GINA Because her umm, view of what's fair in my, I, my point of view is it very… 

00:23:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:23:45
GINA And so, ah, that's why I haven't been talking to you kinda went it a hold off and that for a while and I felt bad that Joey(ph) was part of it and that's my son. 

00:23:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… 

00:23:55
GINA And he didn’t get to see his aunt on his birthday. 

00:24:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… 

00:24:00
GINA It was a hard decision, but I had to do that, I had to be firm for myself and um, there's just a lot of things that are going on, so… 

00:24:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Does that sort of go against your normal grain that you would not talk and not invite her, not, not brought Brenda to the birthday. 

00:24:15
Listening for the counter story 

00:24:15
GINA Yeah, I've never, not done that before… 

00:24:20
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:24:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:24:20
GINA …with any family member, but it that's how bad it hurt, that's how I felt about it I felt betrayed. 

00:24:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. So that was like an expression of how this conflict was affecting you. 

00:24:30
GINA Exactly. 

00:24:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Right. And it was, it was leaving you with a lot of sadness, I think that's what you're saying, I mean you, no doubt you're feeling sad after your mother's death anyway. 

00:24:40
GINA Hmm… hmm… 

00:24:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE But this is kinda of added to that. 

00:24:40
GINA Definitely. 

00:24:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And, ah it's even you know, it kinda puts you in the position we have to move, right? 

00:24:45
GINA Yes. 

00:24:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Ah, and gives you this sort of burden of a sense, a sense of unfairness. Anything else it's doing? 

00:24:55
GINA Ah, I would just focus on the unfairness… 

00:25:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:25:00
GINA …because that's basically the majority of my feeling right now. 

00:25:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE That's this, this big… 

00:25:05
GINA Hmm… hmm… 

00:25:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Strong feeling that you're left with. 

00:25:05
GINA Yes. 

00:25:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE By this whole thing. 

00:25:10
GINA Yeah, and I don't life is unfair, but we can try to make something fair out of it. 

00:25:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… 

00:25:15
GINA So, we can establish a relationship. 

00:25:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE You know what impact would you say this whole thing has had on the relationship between, you know you've described a number of things that's why I'm wondering how you, you would sort of summarize those things. I mean, you have described how it was for each of you, how it's affected each of you personally, but what, what would you say about its effect on your relationship? 

00:25:35
BRENDA It's distanced us. 

00:25:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE It's distanced you? 

00:25:40
BRENDA Umm… yeah and kinda feel like a bitterness between us. 

00:25:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:25:45
GINA And the mistrust because, I, I'm of course I was investing to see who helped her, if mom actually talked to her, Brenda before she changed, revised the will, so there is that mistrust. 

00:26:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, it's increased your sense of suspicion or… 

00:26:05
GINA Definitely. 

00:26:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

00:26:05
GINA Hmm… hmm… 

00:26:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… And would that fit with how you normally think of yourself to be suspicious of your sister? 

00:26:15
The counter story is a different story of relationship that contrasts with 

00:26:15
GINA Yeah. She is my sister and I'm. 

00:26:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE It would fit with you… nobody to be suspicious. 

00:26:20
GINA Ah, no… 

00:26:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE No. 

00:26:20
GINA I've never ever questioned but something like this. I'm sorry. Ah I, she is my sister, I would never question her, but this is a big thing and I know that her father had helped her mother agreed this will and so I don't know, why she decided to change it within the last six months. 

00:26:40
BRENDA I don't know either, how that part like that. 

00:26:40
GINA Yeah, we will see. 

00:26:40
Summarizing conflict effects 

00:26:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Umm… So, okay. We've listed a number of things, and I've just made a list of these, umm, here the things that it has done this whole situation to affect you both and to affect your relationship. Umm… and I'm wondering whether you want this to continue and perhaps develop further, or whether you would prefer things to be in a different place? 

00:27:10
Asking the clients to take a position on the conflict 

00:27:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE I don't know, you've kinda hindered that there already, but I've just wanted to speak checking in relation to these affects that you've just talked about what you would prefer? 

00:27:20
BRENDA Umm… much really have a better relationship… 

00:27:25
GINA Hmm… hmm… 

00:27:25
BRENDA …and be able to you know, use each other for support and really be more like sisters, I guess. 

00:27:35
GINA Yeah. 

00:27:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Have a better relationship, use each other for support, is that right? 

00:27:45
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:27:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And what was that last thing about a sister relationship, what was it? 

00:27:50
BRENDA Yes, actually act like sisters. 

00:27:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Act like sisters, okay. And do you mind if I just ask Brenda a couple of more things about that? 

00:28:05
GINA Sure. 

00:28:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Umm… What's, so what's the history of you supporting each other? 

00:28:10
Inquiring into the history of the counter story 

00:28:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE I mean it is that you know, you've described differences between you over the years. 

00:28:15
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:28:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE But I'm just interested in the history of that? 

00:28:20
BRENDA I think we've intended to be there for each other. You know, it would have the intentions, but ah, I think we could do a lot better, you know. 

00:28:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So you, you would describe it as an intention that has sometimes not quite been carried as far as you… 

00:28:40
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:28:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE …you would like it, preferably? 

00:28:40
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:28:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:28:45
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:28:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So is that intention ever been manifest, I mean, are there, are there any ways in which you have a sense of offering your support to Gina or experiencing her offering support to you? 

00:29:00
BRENDA Well, like I've you know, I'll come over and I'll watch Joey(ph) you know, hang out with Joey(ph) and… 

00:29:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay, okay. 

00:29:00
BRENDA …you know, she has been actually, you know, she'll help every now and then with, ah, me trying, you know, get into my photography and… 

00:29:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, how's she done that? 

00:29:10
BRENDA Umm, well she came with me, I was looking at different studios to rent and you know, spaces for that, so she was actually there for that. 

00:29:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:29:25
BRENDA Hmm… 

00:29:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And what did that mean to you, when she did that? 

00:29:30
Landscape of meaning question 

00:29:30
BRENDA That it was actually important to her. You know, that you know, I'm not married and I don't have kids in the whole family that it's that, you know still what I do is, you know, worthwhile and it's not just some, and that it is important to me like she kinda realize it and it just that I guess she realized it wasn't important to me. You know, other people might not see it as important. 

00:29:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so it was somehow validating for you. 

00:29:55
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:29:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is that fair? 

00:29:55
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… Yeah. 

00:29:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:29:55
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:30:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE That she took seriously something that, some other people may not have taken seriously and saw how important it was to you. 

00:30:05
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:30:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Right? 

00:30:05
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:30:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay, and was it, does it qualify as acting like sisters? 

00:30:10
BRENDA I guess so. 

00:30:10
Suggesting a title for the counter story 

00:30:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE It did at the time. 

00:30:15
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:30:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And that's sort of what you would prefer to have more of here? Right. 

00:30:20
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… Yeah. 

00:30:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay, how about you Gina, can I come back and ask you the same question, I mean… 

00:30:25
GINA Sure. 

00:30:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE What would you prefer? I mean, you said that you don't want these effects of this conflict between you to carry on and to create that ongoing distance between you. So, what you prefer, what would you, how do you describe it? 

00:30:40
GINA I would say validation of feelings, that's a big thing and I know, you did mention that. Ah… 

00:30:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, relationship that was one in which feelings will get more validated. 

00:30:50
GINA Yeah. 

00:30:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE What kind of relationship would do that, do you think for you? 

00:30:55
GINA Umm… I know, she said she was part of Joey's(ph) life, which she is on occasion, but it would be nice if you would spend more time with the family and, and you know, may be… 

00:31:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, it would include spending time… 

00:31:10
GINA Spending times. 

00:31:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE …with, with your family. 

00:31:10
GINA Hmm… hmm… 

00:31:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Anything else? 

00:31:20
GINA And may be not suggesting that my lifestyles are that bad as far as my choice of being a parent. 

00:31:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… 

00:31:25
GINA Because it's seems as if you're, you're… you're standoff issue about my lifestyle and my choices. So… 

00:31:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, this is another area of we would like some validation of… 

00:31:35
GINA Yeah. 

00:31:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE …of your choices in life as being what worthwhile choices or… 

00:31:40
GINA Yeah, maybe is in… tell me that I'm a good mom or something like that, something I worked hard for to secure, your photos. 

00:31:50
BRENDA Umm… 

00:31:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And if you would have some of those things and maybe some other things, you could think of, umm, what would that lead to in terms of how you would describe the relationship between you if those things were there? 

00:32:05
GINA I think we would establish understanding, umm… 

00:32:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Understanding? 

00:32:10
GINA Yeah. She said she wants me to participate more on validate your photographs as well as me, I want you to validate my parenting. 

00:32:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:32:20
GINA Maybe we can understand each other. 

00:32:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, tell me about the history of those things, have you had any places, where validation has happened for you in your relationship with Brenda. 

00:32:30
GINA Ah, you know not that I could really remember, ah… 

00:32:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE But what will be… put it this way, what will be the closest thing that would come to that? 

00:32:40
GINA To meet validated… 

00:32:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Well the thing that would come closest to that if you put… let put it that way to validation. 

00:32:45
GINA I've to get back to you on that, you don't mind. 

00:32:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. It's like is… I guess what I'm asking is, you know, in the history of your relationship are there been even just a single instance of something that Brenda did that you experienced as validating. 

00:33:05
Landscape of action question seeking unique outcomes 

00:33:05
GINA Umm… maybe, maybe when she does come over and visit our family just seems like there is a better spirit and… 

00:33:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, is… 

00:33:20
GINA I think, if I'm answering that correctly. 

00:33:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay, yeah, that sounds fine. 

00:33:25
GINA So… 

00:33:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, there have been those the times when you've had those visits that have ah, felt like a better spirit. 

00:33:30
GINA Yeah, she was able to have fun and it just felt like everything fit perfectly at that time. 

00:33:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Everything fit perfectly. And then you're thinking of a particular occasion or just like this? 

00:33:45
GINA It was just maybe like a Wednesday, we had Taco Night and she came over and just to hung out, we watch television and… 

00:33:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, it wasn't a big deal, it's just a Wednesday Taco night. 

00:33:55
GINA Hmm… hmm… 

00:33:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Watching TV, kinda of evening. 

00:33:55
GINA Yeah. 

00:33:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE But that felt need to you somehow right? 

00:34:00
GINA It did, it felt like what we're supposed to do all along, so… 

00:34:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE When was the last time that happened? 

00:34:05
GINA It's been a long time, umm, that's when I was living in the apartment, so… 

00:34:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Was it, was it before your mom was sick, your mom. 

00:34:15
GINA Yeah. Maybe when she just started. 

00:34:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:34:15
GINA She has had cancer for a while. 

00:34:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE For a while, okay. 

00:34:20
GINA So, maybe better, gosh three years ago. 

00:34:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:34:20
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:34:25
GINA So… 

00:34:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so, has there been any other, could I ask again, are there are any other sort of little instances like that that would be similar kinds of things that would fit with the idea of, you know, greater understanding and validation between you? 

00:34:40
GINA Umm… I guess she did validate me when I had it, I was, I took charge in for the funeral… 

00:34:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:34:50
GINA …ah, arrangements. And there was a moment where we sat alone and before even talked about the will we get cried together and… 

00:35:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:35:00
GINA …we were able, we were able to talk about a lot of things, positive things… 

00:35:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Umm… 

00:35:05
GINA So it just felt like we were appreciative of each other. 

00:35:10
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:35:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And you’re agreeing, do you remember this moment? 

00:35:15
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:35:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Was that kind of for you more like acting like sisters at that moment? 

00:35:20
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… Yeah. 

00:35:20
GINA Yeah, that… 

00:35:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE That sounds like a, a very special moment after your mama died, right? 

00:35:30
GINA Definitely. 

00:35:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And you're able to have conversation about things that were important to you both and family… 

00:35:40
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:35:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE …family connection was present in that moment. 

00:35:45
GINA And she was very grateful that like she'd mentioned how beautiful the funeral was and… 

00:35:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Really? 

00:35:50
GINA …how you know. I thank you taking over and she had mentioned how it would've been hard for her to be involved. 

00:35:55
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:35:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:35:55
BRENDA She did all the arrangements and… 

00:36:00
GINA Hmm… hmm… 

00:36:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Did she? 

00:36:00
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:36:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And what was it like for you that she did that? 

00:36:05
BRENDA No, it's kinda of like that was expected like that she is kinda she does those things. 

00:36:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Well, that in that moment when you express gratitude, I guess it was more than just expected… 

00:36:20
BRENDA I… 

00:36:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE It was something you were saying about it. What were you saying? 

00:36:25
BRENDA Yeah, I guess because that she does do a lot of things and I don't ever tell her like that they're appreciated. 

00:36:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:36:30
BRENDA So, it was kind of, ah, and I can do appreciate this. You know, if she does that stuff, and that she is very, umm, you know, she's kind of say glue with the family and… 

00:36:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:36:40
A unique outcome happens in the moment 

00:36:40
BRENDA You know so… it was you know, I guess I have her ever said that before. 

00:36:50
GINA Thank you. It was nice. Glue. 

00:36:50
BRENDA Oh no. 

00:36:50
GINA Oh no, that's sweet. Thank you. 

00:36:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is that, was it like… 

00:36:55
GINA It was good. 

00:36:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE …it was good to hear to say that. 

00:37:00
GINA That, that's all along that was the validation that I wanted to hear as far as, as I was trying to do like, I'm the family oriented one and I wanted to fix whatever wasn't fixed in. 

00:37:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… 

00:37:10
GINA Put things together and sometimes you just wanted to give up on certain things and that's the point where I felt that was happened and kind of maybe we're fixing it right now or… 

00:37:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:37:25
GINA But it was nice too. 

00:37:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, it's kinda like it's not enough to just to be the glue of the family. It's important that it's appreciated that you're actually doing something that's important. 

00:37:30
GINA Definitely. 

00:37:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

00:37:35
GINA Yes. 

00:37:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And this is that moment was there at the time of the special conversation in the funeral, after funeral. 

00:37:40
GINA Hmm… hmm… 

00:37:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And it's also here right now. 

00:37:45
GINA Yeah. 

00:37:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Because, that makes a difference to you to hear this. Umm, so I guess, I, I'm wondering where that brings us to in terms of the issues that you're wanting to actually, umm, address about the will and the, the things that have left, you're both feeling distant from each other. 

00:38:10
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:38:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Because, it's sounds like, there is and your desire to have a relationship, that features, umm, using each other for support, understanding, and validation, umm and acting like sisters and there are some examples that we've been able to find of those kinds of things being present in your relationship. 

00:38:30
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:38:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE I guess at least me to ask if you're to keep those, the spirit of those ideas of relationship close, what would you start to think about. What ideas could be bring forward, for how you would address the question of the will. 

00:38:50
Using the counter story of relationship to address conflict issues 

00:38:55
GINA Well, I would take about how I would, I feel that it is unfair that the house has split the way that it was you know, mom did say she wanted to take care of you, but I'm important to it. I think I'm important to her too, so we can work with that and see if you can come down to an agreement with that, that will be a start. 

00:39:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So what would be fair? What, you, you know… 

00:39:20
BRENDA Umm… 

00:39:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE I'm interested in, you know again in the spirit of this relate, relationship that you described, Umm, what could you suggest that could, could be for you feel like a fairer outcome. 

00:39:35
GINA If we just split it down from it all 50-50 the way that… 

00:39:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE The house? 

00:39:40
GINA …that dad wanted it to be. 

00:39:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. And what about for you, in the spirit… 

00:39:50
BRENDA I just don't see that with the will I don't see it as being unfair. Like it's more like those were our mother's wishes and she like that was her decision to make with what happen with it and it's not our place to, to question it or to you know to change her decision that she had made or you know regardless of what is in the will, and I just don't think you know, that you know, okay. 

00:40:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, again in the spirit of the relationship that you would like to have what you have in the way of suggestions… 

00:40:20
BRENDA Umm… 

00:40:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE …for ideas for addressing this issue. 

00:40:30
BRENDA Ah… it is difficult because it's kinda of, I mean it's hard to ahh, like for me like it it's hard to negotiate the will. Like I think that's kinda of what she is wanted to do. 

00:40:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… is that fair enough. You would like to negotiate the will. 

00:40:45
BRENDA Difficult. 

00:40:45
GINA Yeah, can negotiate that. 

00:40:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And tell me what's the difficulty is there for you? 

00:40:55
BRENDA Because for me it's like those are you know, it was like mom's decision. 

00:41:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… 

00:41:00
BRENDA You know, not something for us to negotiate. 

00:41:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:41:05
GINA But mom made this decisions when she was the most ill and so that's why I don't feel as if she was thinking clearly. Maybe she was worried about to you, I don't know. I may seem self-sufficient to say that you're, you know feel what is good(ph), you know say that we're equal, I say that's treat that will equally to… 

00:41:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay, you, there are some differences here in your position on the will. 

00:41:35
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:41:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE For you, it's a matter of just honoring your mom's wishes. 

00:41:40
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:41:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And just leaving it as it is. For you it's a matter of treating that something that can be negotiated. If it were to be negotiated what would that mean to you in terms of your relationship? 

00:41:55
GINA Then, I wouldn't have resentment towards our mother. 

00:41:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Towards your mother? 

00:42:00
GINA Yeah, because that would, I had started to build and then but what happened is that I have resentment towards Brenda and she is my sister and I don't want to resent her and went on my life and… 

00:42:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… 

00:42:10
GINA I just think that if we just let's just treat each other fairly. 

00:42:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:42:20
GINA And… 

00:42:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And if you, your position was about leaving things as your ma, mom want them to be. 

00:42:25
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:42:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… And if you, if that would be the case, what would that meant to you? 

00:42:35
BRENDA Is that she like that the kinda of her dying wishes in a way. 

00:42:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… 

00:42:40
BRENDA And just, you know honoring her hmm, her desires and her decisions and you know, like not questioning her. 

00:42:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm, but there is a sense, which you would be getting something extra out of this, so I'm wondering, hmm, what that means to you as well. I mean what's I mean is it important to you to get the… 

00:43:05
BRENDA For our mother really quite like, you know how like she is kinda of question you know, like I would say it is not fair. Like, I guess we're just having question before if it's fair or not, because I've just always seen her as that's what it is. 

00:43:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE You've seen it that, the will, you mean. 

00:43:25
BRENDA Yeah, that that just like, so I never I guess really thought about is it, you know in the way fair, because, you know. 

00:43:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm, so fairness isn't something that you've applied to you're thinking about this. 

00:43:40
BRENDA No. 

00:43:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Fairness to Gina or fairness to you? 

00:43:45
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:43:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:43:50
BRENDA But does seem strange, I was changed. 

00:43:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE It does. 

00:43:55
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:43:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE That… 

00:43:55
BRENDA So I guess, like I could (inaudible ) dad agreeing upon something and… 

00:44:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:44:00
BRENDA …having her change it. 

00:44:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, it's a little bit of a niggling feeling about… 

00:44:05
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:44:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE …that, that sits with you? 

00:44:10
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:44:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Tell me what that niggling feeling does? Why, what, what differences they make? 

00:44:10
An opening to negotiation of a different story 

00:44:15
BRENDA Well, because in its kinda like or Dad's wishes aren't being you know, honored in… 

00:44:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:44:20
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:44:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, you… what you saying about your mom's wishes would also apply to your dad's wishes. 

00:44:25
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:44:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:44:30
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:44:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So what would honoring your dad's wishes be, what would that look like? 

00:44:35
BRENDA Oh, what the role had been to four of us that house was 50-50. 

00:44:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… 

00:44:40
BRENDA Hmm… and I can't remember the other step. I know the major thing. I know the house was 50-50, hmm. 

00:44:50
GINA Yeah, that really researched the rest of the stuff. 

00:44:55
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:44:55
GINA I mean, that we just found out about the painting, and then the jewelry, and then the dishes, those were other main things that were split between us to create fairness. But, ah, I think there is for me that more symbolism in the picture than the jewelry. 

00:45:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… 

00:45:15
GINA So, that's where we are so disagree and that's only everything surfaced and then we discussed it quickly and I made that comment. 

00:45:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Alright, okay. I, I mean, I'm not sure how much money is involved here, do you want… can I understand that, I mean the house has got a valuation I imagined as, what, what's it worth. 

00:45:40
GINA I think the house is… 

00:45:40
BRENDA Is 600,000. 

00:45:40
GINA Yeah. 

00:45:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE About 600,000? 

00:45:40
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:45:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay and it's completely mortgage free or what? 

00:45:50
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:45:50
GINA Yes… 

00:45:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, we' talking about a, a reasonably sizable sum of money that's involved it as the difference between you. 

00:46:00
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:46:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Alright. Hmm. And you've also got some concerns about the painting and the hmm… the jewelry… 

00:46:05
GINA Yes. 

00:46:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE …are they, is that right? 

00:46:10
GINA Yeah. It's like with the dishes and the jewelry ahh… it equals out the cost of the painting. So, that's it they did create I believe that was how they saw things equally. 

00:46:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:46:20
GINA But. 

00:46:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE But what? 

00:46:20
GINA I don't feel as if I get that symbolic value, you know the symbolism eating off of something from my mother. 

00:46:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, that's the importance of that to you. Is that something to that with that symbolism. 

00:46:35
GINA Yeah definitely. I'm the first born, I want to have that picture for my son and you know that pass it down from him and I mean that is where I, a maternal and that's why that picture means something to me. 

00:46:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… hmm… hmm… 

00:46:50
GINA And so… I don't know why she gave it you. 

00:46:55
BRENDA But… 

00:46:55
GINA Brenda. 

00:46:55
BRENDA I also has a meaning to me to though and I can see how… 

00:46:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE What's the meaning to you? 

00:46:55
BRENDA …it has a meaning to you. Well, I just I know mom supported me in my, you know and my love of photography and you know, wanting to, you know I'm just getting my studio off the ground and going and hmm, like I mean as she just, I'm supporting that aspect of my life. 

00:47:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, despite all the good will that you spoken off and the desire for the relationship that features understanding and validation. We still have these issues that are dividing you. And I've just got a question that's going to my mind as we think about that. I'm just wondering if you're think of all of this from your mom's point of you and perhaps also from your dad's point of you. 

00:47:35
A remembering question opens a different negotiation 

00:47:35
BRENDA Umm. 

00:47:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE What would they be wanting if you at this time? 

00:47:45
GINA I think, ah, fairness and they won't want us to argue. 

00:47:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE They wouldn't want you to argue? 

00:47:50
GINA They hated it. 

00:47:50
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:47:55
GINA I damn that wouldn't be. 

00:47:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Your… what's your thought about that? 

00:48:00
BRENDA That they would want, I mean they just really always wanted the best for us and you know, they wanted us to be happy and… 

00:48:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:48:05
BRENDA Yeah… Yeah… 

00:48:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, you know if your dad could speak. If your mom could speak in this meeting, what would they perhaps suggest as ways of discussing this so that you could reach some kind of agreement, I mean what, what kinda of ideas would… 

00:48:30
BRENDA Umm… 

00:48:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE …that they suggest being brought up it for you. 

00:48:30
GINA I think our dad would be mad at our mother for making any changes at the end, hmm… 

00:48:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. What you're saying? 

00:48:40
GINA They… 

00:48:40
BRENDA Like also that, I mean that your intentions may be with the will, would be to make sure that we're, you know we're okay and we have you know us, you know that we have some other live in… 

00:48:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:48:55
BRENDA Umm… You know, that you like that… that you know I can make their intentions were just to be to make sure that were okay. 

00:49:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, if you could speak each other in a way that keeps your mom's and your dad's voices alive, what would you, what could you sort of suggest or offer to each other that would help resolve this, at this time. 

00:49:20
GINA Umm… 

00:49:25
BRENDA Okay. 

00:49:25
GINA Okay, I’ll give you that fancy skin wear and jewelry for the painting… I don't know, but like something like maybe we can talk to something. 

00:49:35
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:49:35
GINA You know. 

00:49:35
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:49:35
GINA Because… 

00:49:35
BRENDA That isn’t so much that the will has to stay set how it was I guess, because it's more about, that has been happy and not so much about like there, you know what they had written down in the past, you know, maybe when things are changed and their intensions were for us to… 

00:49:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE To be happy. 

00:49:55
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:49:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Alright. 

00:49:55
BRENDA Yeah. You know, that might have changed something written in the will. 

00:50:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, what is that lead you to Brenda that thought that maybe that you could honor your own parent's best intentions. 

00:50:10
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:50:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Rather than just a piece of paper. 

00:50:10
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:50:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? I mean… 

00:50:10
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:50:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE What, what might that lead you to maybe to suggest or offer to Gina? 

00:50:20
BRENDA I mean, like she is, I guess, I'll open to that we seen you know, what each thing could be fair and you know this opened to you know, negotiate or making some changes to it, I'm not sure exactly what those would be, I'm but, I'm willing to discuss it. 

00:50:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE What's that like for you to here that? 

00:50:45
One person makes meaning of another's words 

00:50:45
GINA That's a great idea. Umm… maybe we can agree on just let's keep the house, because that's the house that we grew up then and then maybe talk about the… 

00:50:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Would that mean something to you to keep the house in the family? 

00:51:00
BRENDA Well no there is… 

00:51:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Rather than sell, let's say. 

00:51:00
BRENDA I've been living there. 

00:51:05
GINA Yeah. 

00:51:05
BRENDA I know you guys are… I mean just, you know it will be a difficultly to have to move and go through, you know buying a house and selling a house, and splitting the money …Hmm… 

00:51:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, you would like to see Gina continue to live there? 

00:51:20
BRENDA Yeah, I know Joey(ph) he has been… 

00:51:20
GINA Hmm… hmm… 

00:51:20
BRENDA I mean, gosh he run around that house… 

00:51:25
GINA Hmm… hmm… 

00:51:25
BRENDA And you know his eyes closed and he knows it like back of his hand and… 

00:51:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… 

00:51:30
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:51:30
GINA And he is going to school. We just didn't list it out… just around the corner. 

00:51:35
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:51:35
GINA So, it would be nice, if he stay it in. And at least we can agree on that. 

00:51:40
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:51:40
GINA You know. 

00:51:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So… 

00:51:40
GINA So, it's a nice start. 

00:51:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Do have that's sounds like a, an important step there that you're just taking. 

00:51:45
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:51:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE What might be the terms on which it will be worthwhile for you both to have that, to have, you have any thoughts about that. 

00:51:55
GINA I guess it's that 10% is creating fairness. 

00:52:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE That's where the, the rub is between you, right. 

00:52:00
GINA Yeah. Umm… 

00:52:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… 

00:52:05
GINA Hmm, but I guess like I am living there, so that must count for something… 

00:52:15
BRENDA Yeah… 

00:52:15
GINA So… 

00:52:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE You mean, that's of the some of the 10% is that what you meant or not? 

00:52:20
GINA Maybe coz, it does make sense, I mean you'll have your own place and… 

00:52:25
BRENDA Yeah. Then, you have, you've been staying there not paying rent and… 

00:52:25
GINA Yeah. 

00:52:30
BRENDA You know, you have. Umm you know, Josh is bringing in money and you maybe to thought it, it might help me out a little bit more, you know, having pay rent, and you guys were there rent free, no mortgage… 

00:52:45
GINA And I'm not too sure how about it work out to as far as we do have to pay you something and to have to pay you are, and then that creates a mortgage for us. Umm… 

00:52:55
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:52:55
GINA I just, I think it just been familiar with the whole process. 

00:53:00
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:53:00
GINA But, we'd, yeah. 

00:53:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Are those you've described several things that perhaps you need to actually go away and think about and calculate. 

00:53:10
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:53:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE You know, like is there are question of, you know like how much has it been worth for you to stay there, rent free while your mom was there. How much has it been worth for you to take time away from the workforce and look after your mom. Right. 

00:53:25
GINA Hmm… hmm… 

00:53:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE How much is it worth to you to see the house stay in the family and to see Joey(ph) able to stay there. 

00:53:35
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:53:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE How much is it worth to, hmm, have to you know, sell up and go and buy a new house. Pay all the cloths and cost and all of those kinds of things, right. 

00:53:45
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:53:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… I mean it may, if you would sort of think about the, the worth of those kinds of things [00:53:55I know it's hard to put money value on stuff which has such powerful, emotional things, but you are still… 

00:54:00
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:54:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE …having to sort out this whole money issue, right? 

00:54:00
BRENDA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:54:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Umm… I don't know, I mean, I'm just, I'm just speculating here. 

00:54:05
BRENDA You know, I think we could do it. Now, especially which is being more, and you know like I can (inaudible ) go simply you know as far as what the will is. 

00:54:15
GINA Hmm… 

00:54:15
Shifting the relationship story makes negotiation easier 

00:54:15
BRENDA Like it's not about you know, them who you’re choosing over one another or it's not just about their wishes like… 

00:54:20
GINA It's more about, I guess what was fair and I, I didn't see it that way too. I did see that it was fair, but I guess it makes sense now. 

00:54:30
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:54:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE What's making sense more now, Gina? 

00:54:35
GINA I didn't really consider the fact that I was living there as part of negotiation or… 

00:54:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:54:45
GINA …or ah, I guess an arrangement I had… 

00:54:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Well it may or may not be, that's up to you two to decide. 

00:54:50
GINA Yeah, okay. 

00:54:50
DR. JOHN WINSLADE I am not, I am not wanting to persuade you, that that's needs to be the part of the agreement, but I'm just… 

00:54:55
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:54:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE …these are just things that you brought up and I am just saying well you know, how much of those things worth, how important are they? 

00:55:00
BRENDA Yeah. Now, I feel more comfortable actually talking to you about this now though. 

00:55:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Do you? 

00:55:05
GINA Yeah. 

00:55:05
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:55:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:55:05
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:55:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE I'd be, you'd been sitting there in the back of your mind without having been able to talk about it. 

00:55:10
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:55:15
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… 

00:55:15
GINA So maybe we could talk about that and really negotiate what's fair for both of us. 

00:55:20
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… Hmm… hmm… 

00:55:20
GINA Umm…, but what about that painting, coz I know it means a lot to both of us. 

00:55:25
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:55:25
GINA How can we split that? That would be like the big thing. 

00:55:30
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Oh that's? Umm… 

00:55:30
GINA Yeah. 

00:55:30
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:55:35
GINA So, because this is… 

00:55:35
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, does that have to be split and it be, I don't know, ah, the, the ways that you can actually share your value on that, I don't know. 

00:55:45
BRENDA Those, you know put up in the art studio. 

00:55:50
GINA Yeah. So, I, I don't know, I mean, it would be nice to see something like on display and then, I just I'm so used to having it in my home and, and having it in different type of appreciation for it. 

00:56:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… 

00:56:10
GINA And so, I guess your appreciation would be to display it. 

00:56:15
BRENDA Umm. 

00:56:15
GINA So, I guess we could come to some type of an agreement with that, if we can both enjoy in it. 

00:56:20
BRENDA Making a copy of that? 

00:56:20
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Hmm… hmm… 

00:56:25
GINA Yeah, copies aren't the same as the original, ha ha ha… 

00:56:30
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:56:30
GINA …but maybe we can both enjoy it. 

00:56:30
BRENDA Yeah, and because it does actually mean and you know, just having them, and you know, it's kind that presence is there and that photo(ph) like supporting. 

00:56:40
GINA Hmm… hmm… 

00:56:40
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Umm… And you both want to feel that presence, right? 

00:56:40
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:56:45
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Umm… 

00:56:45
GINA Yeah, definitely. Because I think it does remained us of our mother. 

00:56:50
BRENDA Hmm… hmm… 

00:56:50
GINA You know, although there was one child, there is definitely two of us, so. 

00:56:55
DR. JOHN WINSLADE I mean you know, some people take turns to have a painting and have it for a period of time and then someone else has it for a period of time, I don't know, I mean there is just… 

00:57:05
GINA After that. 

00:57:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE …some people do that. 

00:57:05
GINA Hmm… 

00:57:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE We need to finish. 

00:57:10
GINA Okay. 

00:57:10
DR. JOHN WINSLADE So, what I am wondering is, it sounds like you've got some ideas that you're contemplating and that perhaps you need to go away and think through and work out a little bit on your own and I don't know maybe continue this conversation together. 

00:57:25
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:57:25
DR. JOHN WINSLADE And maybe we can come together like in a week or so and sort of talk about where you got to in your own thinking, maybe in your conversation between you and see if we can actually work out some understanding, some agreement, that would lead to, to both feel like, you could act together like sisters and have a sense of validation and understanding between you and that would be able to continue. How's that sound? 

00:57:55
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:57:55
GINA Yeah. 

00:58:00
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Do you think, you are really at a place where you can do that. 

00:58:00
GINA Well, definitely… 

00:58:00
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:58:00
GINA …better understanding right now than… 

00:58:05
DR. JOHN WINSLADE Really. 

00:58:05
GINA …ever been listening to each other… 

00:58:05
BRENDA Yeah.
