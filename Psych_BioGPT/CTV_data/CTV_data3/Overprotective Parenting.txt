RICH SIMON Welcome everyone. Wlecome to this webcast on the challenges of parenting in today's world. And my name's Rich Simon. I'm your editor of Psychotherapy Networker. I'm your host for the series. So, we have, uh, explored a range of the issues that parents today are facing. And, uh, today some of the, some of them are universal challenges that, uh, parents have faced since maybe the beginning of time. And some are more contextualized to the, our culture and swings in our culture, and the influence of social change on what happens in families. And today, in particular, I, I think that's the case. Uh, we're, we're gonna be looking at the, this issue of overprotective parenting, and distinguishing real, the advantages of risk in the, uh, in children's lives, and the opportunities that risks offer for kids developing real responsibility, and, uh, we have with us somebody the, who is, uh, has written extensively on this, who is, uh, with us right now, professor, uh, in Halifax, Canada, uh, Michael Ungar. Michael, welcome. 

00:01:25
MICHAEL UNGAR Nice to be here, Rich. 

00:01:30
RICH SIMON Michael, as you, uh, just to put this in, in some context, Michael is actually a well defined, and well differentiated individual. Unfortunately, his broadband connection up in the wilds of Halifax is, uh, not as compatible with our local broadband connection as we would wish. Uh, but we will hear Michael loud and clear, and, uh, we're very fortunate to have him hear today. So, let me, let me start this discussion by quoting you. So, which, may, you, which is always a good way to start a discussion with another person. Uh, and I think you've really captured this in, in a recent paper you wrote where, where, and, uh, ca-, really gives us a focus for our discussions. You write, "Once we institutionalize no touch policies, exercise zero tolerance for snowball fights, climbing trees, or running in the halls, cocooned our children in a middle class world of safe toys, net nannies, cell phones, and a cult of self esteem, will we provide our children with enough risk and responsibility to help them develop the skills we developed at their age. So, have we. are we overprotecting our children today, Michael? Is this as, is this really a major issue for, um, the broad range of, of families that therapists are seeing in their offices? 

00:02:55
MICHAEL UNGAR A-, absolutely, from what I'm hearing, Rich, from all my colleagues, uh, nationally and internationally, is this theme is perpetually appearing more and more. Um, most specifically, what we're seeing is people just really hesitant to let their kids have much risk and responsibility in their lives. Um, you know, uh, they can't walk to school, uh, they can't climb tress, uh, schools ave all kinds of liability issues, so you don't have kids ever learning how to inter-, if they go on a sleepover, you know, they go any kind of school trip, they, they don't, um, they're not allowed to stay with families anymore, so they don't learn how to interact with, with, you know, strangers, or interact with anybody, really. Um, we're seeing, I think there's a direct connection between this, and this is a bit hard to prove because this, this so much noise in the, uh, studies, but we are seeing a lot of children ending up in our universities, and certainly as they're moving through high school, with a lot more anxiety disorders. We're seeing kids appear, certainly in our colleges and universities, without much capacity to cope with stress. Um, uh, whereas before if, you know, you talked to university counselors, they used to say that, you know, what they used to see mostly was about relationship problems and now they see a lot more anxiety disorders. And kids also who don't seem to have the problem solving skills that when they hit a speed bump in terms of, uh, you know, a late exam or a late, a late paper to produce, then they're more likely to plagiarize or to cheat. We see a lot of just really, uh, hesitant children just to sort of take on tasks. Um, I, I guess I'm, I am seeing it across, across the board. I'm, I'm even more concerned though be the kids at the deeper end of problems, and those are the ones who are, you know, heavily using drugs or experimenting with early sexual activity, very high risk sexual behaviors. Or those who are, in some of the clients I see, who are running away from home, or putting themselves in great risk on the streets. And what's sometimes really disturbing about those patterns, those of, of course, being with us all the time, but what's really disturbing is when you meet kids from relatively stable middle class homes where those patterns are, are visible. And then you, I, I can think of a young man I spoke with recently who was in jail, had come in for a variety of other offenses, but also had had his stomached pumped when he arrived because of the amount of alcohol and prescription medications that he'd taken. Um, he wasn't suicidal. What he was was, he'd said, he was a big guy, and he said, "I just want to see what my body could do. And I often feel like, uh, we're seeing more and more kids from, you know, basically stable families, relatively well resourced homes, that are looking for something to say. That these rights of passage, um, that I'm not sure that we're very good anymore, Rich, at, at giving our kids. So, yes, there is definitely this, this phenomenon of, uh, of us being very concerned, need to be concerned. 

00:05:45
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Okay. So, so let's, so that's, so that's part of, let, let's pull back for a second from that. So, what's the, the context of this is, we certainly have a media industry that, uh, gets us hooked because the, the world is, whe-, when we're scared we pay more attention. So, we're, we see a lot of stories that heighten our vigilance about danger. So, in, if, if, when you, as a researcher, someone who, uh, is really on top of this literature, is this a more dangerous world for kids growing up today than 20, 30 years ago, in going back further into history? 

00:06:25
MICHAEL UNGAR Well that, and that's what, you know, when I began to notice this phenomenon, certainly in my clinical practice and in my research, I began to associate, well, obviously the world must be much more dangerous, and that's why parents are within their right to over-, you know, be very, very protective. And then I kinda did the research, and I couldn't find the statistics to back it up. Um, if you look at, like, you know, here in my own country, the police chiefs would argue that, in fact, crime is way down. If you look at, in the United States in places like the Centers for Disease Control, the CDC in Atlanta, they would argue that on all kinds of statistics, from the chances of your kids being killed in a fatal car accident, to the chances of, um, uh, being sexually active young, to any kind of, any of the big risk factors, like, you know, in, in terms of pregnancy, in terms of dropping out of school, in all those kinds of other things. Statistic after statistic basically says that this generation of youth, at least here in North America, as a population, are safer than ever before. 

00:07:25
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Um-hm. 

00:07:25
MICHAEL UNGAR Um, even the FBI, by their own admission of statistics related to kidnappings. Now, you know, you know, everyone knows that, yes, every year in the United States that there's literally hundreds of thousands of children are kidnapped. Absolutely. 99.99% of those children are kidnapped by a relative, a, a parent, uh, it's a domestic dispute, you know, custody battle, that type of thing. But by, even the FBI would say that stranger abductions have probably gone down by two thirds over the last 30 years. 

00:08:00
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Wow. 

00:08:00
MICHAEL UNGAR Now. 

00:08:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:08:00
MICHAEL UNGAR That still means that up to 100 children a year are being abducted, and that's far too many. I mean, that's a, that's, if it was your child it's a tremendous, uh, this is not something you wanna talk, you know, proudly about. But what, for me the issue, whe-, when we stop sending our kids to the playground, when we stop letting them walk to school, when, when we stop giving them any kinds of responsibility in terms of work, we stop letting them interact with adults. Heck, we won't even let them, you know, our 10 year olds, you know, go into the, the Dunkin' Donuts or something and get a, you know, coffee for us while we're sort of in the car, or anything like that. My challenge to parents is, okay, I got the protection side, I see what you're trying to do, but what about all the things that we kids learnt by taking risks? And this is something I've called in my book, Too Safe For Their Own Good, what I've called the risk taker's advantage. That developmentally, we know from (inaudible) 

00:08:55
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. Risk taker's advantage, right? 

00:09:00
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) We know. 

00:09:00
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) That great phrase, yeah. I like that, yeah, risk taker's advanta-, I'm sorry. Go ahead. 

00:09:05
MICHAEL UNGAR No, and we, we know, I mean, this is not necessarily new. It's a nea-, new application of an idea. But if, you know, if you look at, uh, studies out of evolutionary psychology, uh, or we look at say, Lev Vygotsky's work that talked about, you know, back in the early part of the twentieth century he talked about the zones of proximal development. We know that we're hardwired to, to developmentally push ourselves just a little bit beyond our comfort zone. And there's a fairly good and robust literature that says that when we do that we actually prepare ourselves better for, for future stress. So, um, you know, the child, I mean, very practically, the child who's at the ski hill, and, you know, they're about to anticipate the double black diamond run, and they're 10 years old, and I think he can do it. 

00:09:50
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh-huh, right. 

00:09:50
MICHAEL UNGAR If they've had experiences along the way in which they've had to independently negotiate their environment they're much more likely to get to the bottom of that without breaking a leg. It's the child that's been cloistered, that's never had to, sort of, had those opportunities, which is much more likely to, uh, suffer an injury. So, I mean, I always think about it the other way too is, um, do I really want a kid in a car, you know, a three ton vehicle, before they've learned how to drive a bicycle on a street with some traffic? So, you know, it's kind of the developmental milestones and increments that, what children, what, what children sort of need in terms of manag-, and this is the emphasis, of course, right. It has to be manageable amounts of risk, 

00:10:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:10:35
MICHAEL UNGAR To create that, that positive developmental impact. 

00:10:35
RICH SIMON Okay. So, so, let's, let's start translating this. So, this is, uh, I think, uh, you know, when, when we think about it, when I think about my childhood I think about being able to do things that are unimaginable for most middle class kids today. Being out all day in my neighborhood, no adult supervision from 8:00, 9:00 in the morning till 5:00, 6:00 at night. This is not an unusual experience. I wasn't chauffeured around from play date to play date. No, all that's thing, it's the thing, uh, um, assumed some, you had some experience in your own life. So that this is a difficult we we're living in. 

00:11:15
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) Absolutely. 

00:11:15
RICH SIMON Certainly a different world than my daughter would... 

00:11:15
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) Well, I, I walked to school uphill too. 

00:11:20
RICH SIMON Oh, there you go. Okay, great. 

00:11:20
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) Uphill, in the snow. 

00:11:20
RICH SIMON That's, that's a re-, uh, wi-, with the razor, with, uh, sharp stones and razor blades, the log cabin, all that stuff. Okay. So, um, now, as a clinician then, and you, you're both a researcher and a clinician, uh, how does this, uh, present itself in your office, ah, ro-, roughly speaking is this a huge in the, the across the range of the kinds of families that you see? Are there particular kinds of, of families? Is this a, more of a middle class issue? Uh, can we, let's, let's contextualize this a bit. What's the degree to which there's a, you know, a epidemic of overprotective parenting. What do you think the dimensions of this as a climin-, clinical phenomenon are? 

00:12:10
MICHAEL UNGAR Well, I, I'd, I'd say I'm seeing it more, and that's what's always surprising, cuz I do work with a lot of kids who are, sort of, in, more, from more marginalized communities. Cuz, I mean, there's a lot of kids that, frankly, they don't need more risk or more responsibility. They have it in, in abundance. 

00:12:25
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. 

00:12:25
MICHAEL UNGAR But I am seeing, and I have been seeing, when working in a community clinic that focuses on, say, street youth, where there are more and more kids that are actually from middle class homes that seem to, that don't suffer a lot of deprivation. That seem to have had a lot of the advantages in life, and they're sort of manifesting this pattern of, of, um, of problems. Which is part-, you know, it's kind of strange, right. You just kind of begin to, to wonder about it. And then you talk to the kids, and, you know, they're in full out warfare with their parents. And just to give you, so, I'll give you a very concrete example of a, of a, of a young fella, um, uh, sorta 14 years old who had like a curfew, like a 5:30 in the evening on a weeknight, and maybe, maybe 8:30 or 9:00 on a weekend. And, so your question about, you know, is it about just the family, well, in this case they were living in a, in a really lovely, very safe, statistically very safe community, but mom had come out of a very difficult and dangerous environment, and she had been one of these kids that was on the streets. And she kind of new some of the dangers that kids get into when they're out late at night unsupervised at midnight, and all these kinds of things. This was her experience when she was 14. 

00:13:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:13:40
MICHAEL UNGAR So, what she had done was, sort of, say, well, you know, I'm not gonna ever let my child be exposed to any of these particular dangers. 

00:13:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:13:45
MICHAEL UNGAR And she had just, you know, basically bubble-wrapped her own son with all these rules, what music he could listen to, what he could eat, where he moved to. 

00:13:55
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:13:55
MICHAEL UNGAR The, the long and the short of was, cor-, of course, the kid had, you know, there was no credibility to the mom's claims, so, wha-, what, she, they were just stuck. So, I eventually had to sort of work with mom to try and get her to, you know, sort of, differentiate her past experience from what her son was actually living, and the threats that he was actually experiencing. And, I mean, to tell you the truth, it wasn't actually terribly successful because she was so stuck in that, in that fear of what she was bringing forward. We did eventually negotiate a little bit. And, and partly it was about, you know, sort of, working with the boy to kind of talking about his experience as being, sort of, in prison. And it was a sort of strange intervention in some ways, but it was sort of him saying, "Okay, I've got this bad situation. What am I gonna do about it? How am I gonna get more privileges?" And we eventually found the, the, the small, uh, you know, break of, you know, little tiny, uh, opportunity was that mom agreed that as long as he was in organized activities he could, he could be out after his curfew at 5:30 in the evening. 

00:15:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:15:00
MICHAEL UNGAR So, he just simply signed up for every and anything he could possibly, uh, get onto. And then, of course, what he did was he would extend the hours. He would tell mom, "Actually, you know, basketball practice doesn't finish until 8:30." and it would actually finish at 7:30. And then he would go out to McDonald's with his friends, or something like that. So, he found a way a little bit around that. Now, I mean, it would be better if I could have got the mom completely on board, but I think over time she just began to look the other way. But it was a, it was a lot about her. So, are there certain families that fall into this pattern? Generally speaking, in my practice and my research, what I find is actually that it's families with the means to protect their children. Um, families, lower class families, families who have a lot of, sort of, you know, structural constraints in them, they don't actually have the time to watch every practice of their little 5 year old. 

00:15:45
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. 

00:15:45
MICHAEL UNGAR They take their 5 year old to soccer practice, or hockey practice, and they dump the kid. 

00:15:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:15:50
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) And they've gotta, you know, they've gotta go shopping, they've gotta go do something else. It's, it's that sort of, um, you know, people with often smaller families that are very risk averse. Which often defines our sort of dominant culture of the middle class in North America. 

00:16:05
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:16:05
MICHAEL UNGAR That are particularly able. They're not just, not only do they want to, but they're also capable. They're able to, to devote the time to this kind of overprotection. 

00:16:15
RICH SIMON Okay. Okay. 

00:16:15
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) And the, the potential damage there, of course, Rich, the, that's where, that's where you being to see kids really having to either become anxious, they have two options. They become an extremely anxious child. They buy into the world as a dangerous place, even though it doesn't match with your experience. 

00:16:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:16:30
MICHAEL UNGAR Or you go ballistic, and you begin to sort of run out of the house and do the nastiest things you can to try and develop your own rites of passage, rather than having them sort of managed for you by your, by a, by a caring, uh, adult. 

00:16:45
RICH SIMON Okay. So, so, uh, as, uh, so this is an audience of clinicians who are listening into this, and I, I would imagine, uh, folk, many folks are really identifying what you're saying is a pattern in their own practices. So, as a clinician yourself, uh, so you, you've given us an example where the parent didn't have a lot of flexibility. And you would up, as one often does in families and systemic interventions, you have an impact where you can. So, in a, uh, give us a, uh, in terms of when parents are somewhat more receptive to this message, how do you structure it? How do you, how do you bring, how do you introduce them to this idea that, perhaps, they're in the, uh, for all kinds of excellent reasons, they're in the, their, uh, well-protection, their protectiveness is backfiring? And how do you organize your, uh, what's your role, and how do you organize your intervention in those cases? 

00:17:40
MICHAEL UNGAR It, it, wha-, it's actually very interesting because, you know, I used to, I think when I was naive enough when I started some of this I was noticing these patterns. I was trying to actually challenge, I was sort of trotting out the statistics, you know, in front of the parents. And I could site that, you know, uh, rates of, uh, teenage sexual behaviors and stuff haven't changed in 40 years, and our kids are as sexually active as they, as we were. Or I could talk about crime rates going down in my community, or whatever, right. And, 

00:18:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:18:05
MICHAEL UNGAR The reluctance, the parents weren't buying it. No, no, I'm stuck on this, right? 

00:18:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, right. 

00:18:10
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) So, I began to sort of think about it. Go different, you just can't go down that route, right? 

00:18:15
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:18:20
MICHAEL UNGAR So, I began to simply say, okay, let's, let me just, I, I don't really know exactly what these parents are living. I don't know how safe their communities really are. I mean, I can look at the stats, but who knows, maybe they, maybe they're, maybe they're right. 

00:18:30
RICH SIMON Maybe they know something you don't, right. 

00:18:30
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) There are problems in their own way. 

00:18:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:18:35
MICHAEL UNGAR So, I, what I did was I just developed four questions, and I found them very effective. 

00:18:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:18:40
MICHAEL UNGAR The first question I would start with is asking the parent to tell me, um, sometimes not even with the kid there, um, just tell me what you were doing when you were the same age as the child. 

00:18:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:18:55
MICHAEL UNGAR So, whatever age, they're 8 years old and they're rebelling or they're 18. I asked the parents what were the risks that you took when you were growing up? And they're, that gets into the, you know, walking the, walking uphill barefoot to get to school, or navigating my streets myself, or whatever it was in terms of boyfriends and girlfriends, and this type of thing. And, you know, there's usually a lot of laughter in that. You know, we sort of joke, and then I always say to them well, what did, you know, what did you learn? And most parents account for their experiences something along the lines of, I learned way too much way too early. God forbid my only child ever has to learn any of that. 

00:19:25
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

00:19:25
MICHAEL UNGAR I say, "Okay, I'm not gonna challenge you on that. That's amazing that you learned those life lessons." And then, I always say, you know, "Were those lessons," the third question is, were those lessons helpful or unhelpful to making you who you are today? And that's where the conversation begins to shift a little bit, because usually the people say, "Well, of course they were somewhat helpful." 

00:19:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:19:45
MICHAEL UNGAR "Some of those lessons were helpful. I learned how to be independent. I learned how to manage money. I learned, I learned about jerks when you're dating people. You know, I learned about," you know, there was something in there, right? "I learned how to cook, I learned how to take responsibility for myself, not like these young people today." 

00:20:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:20:00
MICHAEL UNGAR If I can get them through that, then the fourth questions, which doesn't challenge their overprotectiveness, but works more towards the positive side of this. I say, "Okay, I, I get that you're, you know, your child right now needs you to protect them, and that's how you're, you know, that's, that's how you're doing this. How are you gonna get your child the same life lessons that you got through taking the risks that you had? 

00:20:25
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. Yeah. 

00:20:30
MICHAEL UNGAR And that's a positive conversation, because then we're not talking about them taking away or stopping. I don't want them to have a conversation with them about stopping something. I want to have a conversation with them about how can I get you to do more of what the kid actually needs? And then we begin to come up with strategies where they begin to open the doors a little bit to their kid taking on more, um, more risks. So, for instance, you know, walking school buses. I'm not sure if you know that concept of, you know, kids gathering together at one home and then they're all walking to school, so that they can learn a little bit more of that. 

00:21:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:21:00
MICHAEL UNGAR Plus they get the exercise and avoid, you know, diabetes and all the other, 

00:21:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, okay. 

00:21:05
MICHAEL UNGAR Sort of, along with, uh, (inaudible). But, um, you know, I think about, again, you know, what are the experiences they need to inoculate them against future stress in their lives? And, um, the parents have come up with all kinds of interesting strategies, travel experiences. I mean, I, I learned this actually, I can give you another example. 

00:21:25
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:21:30
MICHAEL UNGAR Very concrete. Um, from a, um, a, a mom that I was working with. Actually two moms, one, one was, uh, um, again, in the overprotection, and, and, she, her 14 year old daughter wanted to go out to the, uh, I guess, different parts of the, of the country are gonna call these things differently. Where I am they call them beach parties, of course, because the kids go down to the beach, they're unsupervised, and there's alcohol, drugs, and, of course, um, opportunities for sex, and, you know, whatever. 

00:21:55
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:22:00
MICHAEL UNGAR And other parts of the country I think they call them keg parties, tailgate parties, bush parties, whatever. 

00:22:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:22:05
MICHAEL UNGAR Um, mom said, this one mom said, "No, no, no, you're too young. You're too young. You can't go. I have, I am so afraid for what would happen to you." and then she tried to offer her daughter these opportunities to be, you know, be in the basement of their home and have pop, and chips, and movie night with her girlfriends. And, of course, 

00:22:20
RICH SIMON No way. 

00:22:20
MICHAEL UNGAR You know, the kid just, the kid just basically, you know, I didn't do that, but, you know, fla-, flash the mom the finger and tears out of the house, and that, this is not gonna end well. A little while later, though, I worked with another parent in the same community, um, who's daughter was struggling with much the same thing. And this kid was up to some pretty bad stuff. And her mom, who had lived a little bit of the rougher life and was trying to protect her kid, realized that there was no way she was going to be able to control this 14 year old. And so what she said to her was, "Look, I really don't want you going down to the, the beach party." Um, but, but she acknowledged that the child was looking for that rite of passage, that she was actually looking for that, Well, that zone of proximal development, that chance to grow. And she said to her daughter, "How about this, I'll take you, if you don't go to that beach party, I will arrange, I will drive you to that big concert." It was actually a, a, sort of an hours drive away, two hours drive away. And she was gonna take this kid to a, one of these big, um, all day concerts. Now, you know, there's gonna be parents listening to this, or parents that we work with are gonna say, "I am never gonna let my kid go into the concert." and stuff like that. But, you know, you gotta, you know, you gotta work with people a little bit, and say, "What, what's the risks here? How dangerous is it really?" And, you know, there's a lot of safety, a lot of security at that concert. And can you let your kid go in? Um, and, actually in this case, this mom actually did. She sat in a, in a, you know, a coffee shop, basically, for 12 hours while her daughter was in the concert watching some, you know, one of the big pop bands that was touring at that time. 

00:23:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:23:55
MICHAEL UNGAR And I learned from her that, you know, kids need that advantage that comes with taking risks. This girl came back from the concert and her behavior changed. She kind of felt more confident. She felt like she had been trusted. Isn't that what we always say, we want our kids to feel trusted, that they feel confident? This wasn't this, Rich, I, I get so fed up when I, when I consult with schools. I do a lot of lecturing in schools, that type of thing. And I'm always amazed when they, um, teachers are still doing these absolutely ridiculous, you know, everybody gets the, uh, student of the day awards that kind of rotate through the classroom? 

00:24:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:24:25
MICHAEL UNGAR There's no shred of evidence that that does anything for our kids' self esteem, but more, it, it, it doesn't embody the sense of responsibility. It doesn't say to the kid, you've taken a little bit of risk in life and you're gonna, you know, you're learning anything from it. So, kids have to have real, genuine experiences with their environment. Interactions that allow them to develop those, that risk taker's advantage, the cognitive, and social, um, and emotional skills that come with being challenged. And, so, for me, I've always, if I can, if I can avoid the argument with the parent that your kid needs, you need to stop doing something, I'm much more likely to have a conversation over here with what can you give your kid that will give them that risk taker's advantage. 

00:25:10
RICH SIMON So, before we move on here, so, let's, let's, you've brought this up, so let's expand on this point for a bit. So, this, they, this is, uh, um, the, uh, the cult of self-esteem. And somehow this entered into the, the culture, uh, gosh, when was it? Maybe 20 years ago that the, uh, and the, um, and I'm not exactly sure. May-, you probably have a clearer idea of what the forces were. I think, probably therapists, as usual, were partly to blame for taking something that in a small dose is a, a good idea, and turning it into something, uh, uh, that became a kind of oppressive, uh, uh principal of parenting that really has backfired on us. So, so say, say little bit about this, the impact of the cult of self-esteem, what the research is telling us, and what, how do we contextualize these ideas about how the importance of ki-, self-esteem and kids, uh, psychological development. 

00:26:15
MICHAEL UNGAR Well, you see, Rich, I do, my, my, my main research project is on the concept of resilience. I do studies in 20 different countries, multi-million dollar projects. We have huge teams that I, I, that I, that I lead and, and, uh, organize. What that research, self-esteem constantly comes up as one of the predictors of a kid overcoming great adversity, right, we know that. And, and this goes back to, um, Norman Garmezy in the US, and a variety of others, needs is one of the key protective mechanisms in kids' lives. 

00:26:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:26:45
MICHAEL UNGAR But you, you see, there's this notion in the stud of resilience of differential impact. I don't wanna get into the big theory of this, but what that says is, if you're a very pushed down, bullied, marginalized kid, an experience where a teacher acknowledges you and you get to do something like, you know, clean the chalkboards, and carry the papers around school, and feel a little bit more, you know, strutting. You know, a little bit more of li-, the, you know, to have the John Travolta kind of like strut from Saturday Night Fever. You got that sort of thing, right? 

00:27:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:27:20
MICHAEL UNGAR That has a tremendous impact on you because you don't have a source of that anywhere else in your life. So ti actually works probably quite well with kids who are very, you know, sort of, marginalized and, and not with a lot of opportunities to feel good about themselves. 

00:27:35
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:27:35
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) But across a whole population of school kids, there's not a, I haven't seen a shred of evidence, I've never seen a study that says that this kind of ubiquitous, you know, rewarding, rewarding, rewarding without any kind of input or expectation has any impact on kids. 

00:27:45
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:27:50
MICHAEL UNGAR And so, what, what I'm, what I'm particularly worried about, in fact, is the opposite effect. Is that kids get the praise without having put in the work. And the work, it, it kind of fits into the same thing as risk and responsibility. You want kids, you know, you want kids to be a little bit off, off their game, a little bit out of sorts. You want them to potentially to, God forbid, fail now and again as they're growing up so that they understand that, you know, the notion of internality, self-efficacy. There's a lot of other ideas that, that sort of wrap around this. You want very concretely a child to succeed because they've actually done something that genuinely is acknowledged by them, and likely by others. So, the family that, rather than these foolish certificates for, you know, just showing up, if, you know, in a home, you know, I, I always said, you know, parents, you know, is your child cooking for you? And they say, "What do you mean cooking for me? That's crazy talk. You know, you can't possibly do that." 

00:28:45
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:28:45
MICHAEL UNGAR And yet, they have these kids who are exercising their own autonomy. They're trying to make decisions for themselves, they're trying to do all these other things that are signaling, I'm an adult. I don't have to come to the table, I don't have to participate in the family, I'm don't have to do this, I don't have to do that. Say, "That's fine. If you're really an adult, well, why don't you take on some responsibilities." And the parents will say, "My kid would never cook." And I gotta tell you, I've gotten the most delinquent kids to cook. 

00:29:05
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:29:05
MICHAEL UNGAR Because it's a big show. It's a genuine experience where somebody is actually gonna eat their food. And there's something you gotta admit, when you're, when you're 13 or 14 and you can cook for somebody, or 12 for that matter, and you make some food, you have to, you know, there's a, there's a, a feedback loop there. 

00:29:25
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:29:25
MICHAEL UNGAR So, the self-esteem thing is, I think, sometimes is a, we get, we get sidetracked to that as if that's gonna protect our kids. 

00:29:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:29:30
MICHAEL UNGAR And the fact is, it does help the more vulnerable kids, but only if it's tied to a genuine thing where they get a lot of recognition and they actually see the benefits. 

00:29:40
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. So, that's interesting. So, and then you have this, this notion that I've, uh, read in, in some of your work, uh, another way of saying I think what you've just been describing about contributions. So, rather than simply messaging a kid's self-esteem out of any kind of real, uh, practical contribution to family life, your emphasis is on what can a kid actually do that, that, uh, adds to the well-being of the family. 

00:30:10
MICHAEL UNGAR Yeah. There, there's something, you know, uh, when I started with these ideas on, you know, overprotective parenting and too safe, and I began to, sort of, you know, look at positive aspects of having kids enough risk and enough responsibilities. As my thinking went further, I began to work with more kids, I actually began to, began to think about this notion of genuine contribution and how we can facilitate that. Mostly I was thinking of this in my, in my, uh, research all around the world. Of course, because, you know, we, we're doing research with kids who are economic, uh, migrants to big cities in China, and street children in Colombia, "AIDS orphans," quote, unquote, in South Africa, and, uh, kids with physical disabilities in India, as well as here in, you know, in North America, kids who are marginalized because of poverty or because of racial identity, and this, this type of thing. And that protective mechanism that also appears very often when you actually watch these kids is you see them doing things that actually no only have risks and responsibilities, but they also make contributions to someone else's welfare as well as, as often their own. And it, it's a real source of thriving for them. 

00:31:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:31:20
MICHAEL UNGAR Which again, I, sometimes when I'm working with families who are more advantaged I'll bring that lesson in, and say, "Well," you know, "how, wha-, what's happening here in this family that allowing you to,to, to, to, to give these kids the opportunity?" Um, if I might, again, give you a very concrete example of working with two daughters. 

00:31:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:31:40
MICHAEL UNGAR Mom, single parent, um, knocking herself out to, to, to, to, uh, you know, just earn a living with her daughters, and keep them after the divorce, sort of, all, you know, the family all together and whatnot. And, uh, Christmas was coming. This is all happening just before Christmas. And mom really needed to get some help because she working a lot of extra shifts, and she said to her two teenage daughters, you know, "Would you just decorate the tree? Set, drag the tree out of the, the closet, set it up in our apartment." you know, "Make, make it," a little townhouse is what they had, actually, said, you know, "Would you just set up the tree and help me out a little bit?" 

00:32:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:32:15
MICHAEL UNGAR And it was really interesting because the, you know, the daughters had sort of been taking this free ride. Their behavior had been deteriorating, what, the younger one wasn't calling her mom on their cell phone after school, so that mom was constantly worried about her safety. There was a lot of, you know, you know, a family beginning to sort of stress a great deal. It was interesting because, in the dad's home, where the girls visited now and again, dad's rules were selfish to the max. This was a guy who, he, for instance, the girls had, um, things like iPods over at the, the dad's house, and they could never bring the iPods home. It was dad's stuff, dad's home. Even to the point he got a puppy for the youngest daughter, at one point. Of course, the puppy had to stay there. And then this guy. 

00:32:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:33:00
MICHAEL UNGAR Picks up and decides he's gonna move to another country with his new wife, and basically garage sales all the girl's stuff rather than letting them take it back to their mom's, including taking the puppy to the SPCA. So, you've kind of got this culture of selfishness that these girls are being sort of brought into. Anyway, mom, mom is dealing with this, the after effects, and she, she eventually says, you know, "But I need you to start contributing to this family." And she's really trying to say to them, this is a different set of house rules. And then I saw the most remarkable thing. She, she actually, through some work with me, she, you know, Christmas was coming, she figured the girls wouldn't set up the tree. Christmas Eve came, the girls didn't fulfill their obligations, and the next morning they woke up and mom hadn't saved the family. She hadn't decorated the house, but she hadn't been vindictive either. 

00:33:50
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:33:50
MICHAEL UNGAR She had actually fulfilled her contribution. She bought the girls, in this case, the new iPods, the new iPod touches that they wanted. 

00:33:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:33:55
MICHAEL UNGAR Which meant a lot of extra shifts for her at the new job. And there were, you know, she described the scene as, you know, empty living room, like the Grinch had come, except two beautifully wrapped boxes. 

00:34:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:34:05
MICHAEL UNGAR For these iPods. 

00:34:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:34:10
MICHAEL UNGAR And the girls broke down into tears because they realized that they hadn't done their contribution. They hadn't actually, genuinely fulfilled what they needed to do for their mom, which was really a very small thing. And it changed the, it changed the culture in the family. It, it began to get very concrete to understand that when the little one didn't call mom after school, mom worried, and that jeopardized the stability of her family. That she was actually, not a freeloading, it drives me crazy the way sometimes, as parents, and I've lived this and I see this in my neighbors, and my friends as well, so it's not just the clinical stuff. You know that, you know, every, we're always doing for our kids. We're the ones packing the, you know, if you've gotta get your kids the, you know, packing up the, um, the soccer van, right, after school. 

00:34:50
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:34:50
MICHAEL UNGAR Getting the kids to activities, we do everything. And my, we're missing, Rich, we're missing the opportunity to give our kids genuine responsibilities, genuine opportunities. Let them pack their own soccer gear. Let them put it in the washing machine and actually wash it themselves, cuz God knows it needs to. It stinks like high heaven. You know, let's get them doing all that. And, yes. And parents always go, because, of course, we're overprotective, you know, and, and they always, "Well, but," you know, "I'm gonna get to the soccer pitch, and my kid is gonna be missing, my 8 year old is gonna be missing a shin pad. Because, of course, rather than letting them sit and, you know, play their gameboy or whatever it was that the were sho-, that they were playing while I packing and packing, and getting everything ready, I let them pack their own bag. We show up at the soccer pitch, they don't have their soc-, their soccer shin pad. You know, so they're not gonna be able to play. so they, so they're gonna be benched the whole hour. 

00:35:45
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, right, yeah. 

00:35:45
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) And I go, isn't that great? Isn't that, 

00:35:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. (laughs) 

00:35:50
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) I mean, Rich, isn't that exactly what you want your 8 year old to experience? 

00:35:50
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:35:50
MICHAEL UNGAR That, that before they have a Visa card, and before they screw up big time. 

00:35:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:35:55
MICHAEL UNGAR Right. And before they make other bad decisions, that you want them to have, when they're young enough that the consequences are so, so minor, and the responsibility, the lesson is so, so big that they have those experiences that are developmentally appropriate and manageable. This is something that they could have accomplished on their own. 

00:36:15
RICH SIMON So, this is interesting. It, it, it, it's a basic, uh, what, as you're describing this, it seems to me, that wha-, often, I think, today with our sense that the world's a dangerous place, with our, uh, largely accurate view that there's, that, that the culture is so toxic in, to, towards, uh, healthy child-rearing, in many respects, that the parental culture sets itself up as the corrective to that. A counter-balance to all the deficiencies in the wider culture. And what you're describing, in doing that you create a world that is so out of touch with real life lessons, and with these, uh, with important lessons that kids need to learn that you begin to, you, you're depriving them of an opportunity to have a sense of, this is how the world actually operates. These, these are the important lessons in growing up. And you're trying... 

00:37:10
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) And that, there is systemic, I mean, we, we, I do think we do need to think about this as, whether you're, you're focused on individual, you know, psychology, or more systemic issues. 

00:37:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:37:20
MICHAEL UNGAR You know, from an individual, psychosocial, developmental perspective, kids really do need these, uh, these inoculations. They need these opportunities to experience manageable amounts of stress in their life. Um, from a social perspective they also need the, the skill sets, um, that come along, that come along with that. I mean, um, I'm amazed by how, Rich, are you, I don't know if you work much with young people. Some, I work with a fair number of both, you know, I have some great research assistants, I have some great employees. I work at a university, whatever out in the community. My, my son, I have an 18 year old son. I, I see a lot of his friends. Um, I'm amazed sometimes by this, this inability to function in the real world. Like, the lack of job readiness skills. Um, the of, inability to, you know, to stick to something, right? And, um, these are often the same kids whose parents, I know their parents, who have those skill sets. 

00:38:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:38:20
MICHAEL UNGAR And I wonder sometimes if we've abdicated our responsibility of passing along those, those skills, those opportunities, um, to our children. Um, uh, when we, when we're over, when we're not, when we're sort of, um, overprotective of, of them are we not giving them enough, uh, enough, uh, lessons in life? Um, it starts young to, right? I mean, it starts at, like, you go to the playground. Sure, I, I suspect you're also a little bit past, we're both past that phase of being on the playground with our kids. 

00:38:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:38:55
MICHAEL UNGAR But I do remember vividly, even, you know, a decade ago, being on the playground and watching while I was sort of over here, you know, pushing on the swing my daughter, you know, you know, and under-ducks and all those kinds of things. I'm watching, um, this, this parent, this dad with his, um, with his, it was a 4 year old daughter, and she's climbing up the, the monkey bars, right. She's getting higher, and higher, and higher on the monkey bars. And, you know, you can just kinda hear his anxiety of saying, you know, don't, don't go up there. Hey, what are you doing? Get back down here. Hey, woah, woah, you're too high. You're too high. You're too high. And, you know, eventually this, this kid kind of, you know, gets past where dad can reach her and, and she freezes up on the bars, and then he has to sort of, you know, cajole her back down. And then he sort of, eventually, grabs her off the bars, puts her down on the ground, and does that sort of, you know, I'm gonna eat you bear, kind of growls at the kid, right. And goes away from the playground, rather than having taken this opportunity to coach his daughter through that, that climbing. To say to her, you know, "Do you feel safe up there?" 

00:39:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:39:55
MICHAEL UNGAR Where's your feet? Where do you want me to stand? We've abdicated all that sort of problem-solving to our, from our, to our kids. I mean, Rich, I work in the university. There are kids who call their, their mothers and fathers three, or four, or five times a day. 

00:40:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:40:10
MICHAEL UNGAR Here at this university. I have been called because a 23 year old didn't, you know, didn't do well on an exam. 

00:40:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:40:15
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) A 23 year old. And this, you know, And this is, I am not alone in the, in, in, you know, uh, make, telling those stories. But when I, you know, when I see that little girl, that 4 year old, being sort of drawn, not shown how to problem solve, not being told to trust your body, to, to figure out how to negotiate her world. Just think about that kid one decade later who's 14. And I have a, I, my, my daughter's 16 now, but I remember having these thoughts though when she was coming into that age of, of what happens when you give those messages repeatedly to a kid. When that girl is 14, and then she's kind of in a relationship, or she's beginning to date someone who's a little bit older than her, and that, say it's a boy. In this case, a boy, uh, says to her, uh, "You know, I want you to do something with your body. I know you're not comfortable, but I want you to do this anyways. I mean, this little 4 year old has been taught all her life to not trust her body, to not make her own judgment, to, to do things that other people tell her to do. 

00:41:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:41:20
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) Is it any wonder, then, that these kids don't always have that sort of resistance skills to be that sort of kick ass G-R-R-R-L-L, sort of, or I should now say in the Hunger Games, the main character of the Hunger Games. You know, that sort of, you know, feisty, ferocious energy. 

00:41:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:41:35
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) That's out there, and we optimize it, we love it. Where, from where there's Ann of Green Gables or Katniss here, here in the Hunger Games, we're, we're enchanted by it. 

00:41:45
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:41:45
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) But, but are we doing what we actually need to create that? 

00:41:50
RICH SIMON We're, we're afraid, 

00:41:50
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) Mm-hm, in, in our own children. 

00:41:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. So, so when you, as, as a, somebody whose, uh, has a front row seat on, on kids at the university level these days. So, you're bringing up the specter of the helicopter parent and the, you know, this, this, uh, lifeline between child and parent that continues on into the college years where they're, they're kind of outsourcing their decision-making with their parents. So, as, as you really look at this larger population of, of students, do you, who are in their late teens and early 20s, are they, are they really it's, if, if you compare that with 20 or thi-, uh, years ago, 25 years ago, do you really see, uh, is it, is it, the kids different in their behavior as a university professor as you're seeing that, that, that cohort of kids who are moving into adulthood these days? Or maybe not moving into adulthood. 

00:42:45
MICHAEL UNGAR I would say, and I, I would say, uh, unfortunately I don't if there's been that many studies that sort of document this. What we do know, I mean, if there is one statistic, is that we're seeing much, many more, as I mentioned, many more anxiety disorders. 

00:43:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:43:00
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) Among kids. Much more anxiety among kids in, in, in universities. Um, and that, you know, that's somewhat cyclical. You, you know that certain disorders are, you know, if you're under stress you manifest it in certain ways depending on culture and context. So, so that's, in fact, what we're seeing. But I, we also see very much an entitled, consumer driven university student, especially in public institutions. That's, that kind of sense that, well, I'm paying for this therefore I should succeed. 

00:43:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:43:25
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) Versus, you know, that you have to put in some, some, uh, some genuine effort to make a real contribution. Um, you know, I'm not, (laughs) I'm not quite ready to go the, the crazy extent of,uh, you know, Amy Chua's, uh, you know, Tiger Mom, uh, version of this. 

00:43:40
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Right. 

00:43:40
MICHAEL UNGAR Which is, you know, control everything your child does, and force them to, you know, you know, if they're not basically, uh, performing, uh, on the stage at Carnegie Hall that somehow they're a failure. 

00:43:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:43:55
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) Um, that's, that's certainly excessive. I think Amy Chua herself concludes that her behavior was somewhat excessive, though. 

00:44:00
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. 

00:44:00
MICHAEL UNGAR We'll let her speak for that. 

00:44:05
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:44:05
MICHAEL UNGAR But I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm more interested in the fact that I, I think there has to be a balance, but we do have to demand of our children, um, some of their resp-, you know, you have to take some of these responsibilities. Um, you know, that the consequences, that they suffer the consequences. But, Rich, isn't this also about the kids having the skill set so that when they get into a muddle with the teacher that they then go to the teacher to make amends. That they have the social skills, that they're being coached by us. 

00:44:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:44:30
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) As adults, a caring person in their lives, that they're actually being coached so that they have those, those, the, the, the psychosocial skills to negotiate themselves through a rough period. Okay, you know, I, I've just pissed off my Spanish teacher. 

00:44:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:44:45
MICHAEL UNGAR What am I gonna do to fix this. How am I, you know, and think about that as a job ready skill for later in life. Uh, uh, it, it, it, again, it's all these, it's all these things that, that, um, we, we teach. Give you another small example, I mean, universities now, most universities new residences are built, any dorms that are going up, almost always, they're now built with single rooms as opposed to double rooms. Note that I lived in a double room for once, but absolutely, um, crazy, out there, um, roommate. I must say, I wish I had had a single room. 

00:45:20
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Right. 

00:45:20
MICHAEL UNGAR But you learn something through those experiences as well. 

00:45:20
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) (inaudible) 

00:45:20
MICHAEL UNGAR Um, you know, you, you know, again, like, in our homes, again, I'm thinking about, you know, do you, you know, how many televisions do we have and how many gaming systems do we have for our children? And, you know, I often will say to parents, I'll say, again, "I get why you'd have four televisions." You have two children, you have four televisions, everyone can have their own television in the home. But then, I often, "Okay, I'm just curious, when you were growing up, did you learn how to share?" You know, we would, you know, you have to decide you're gonna, which of the three channels you'd watch. I'm, I'm in my late 40s, so you could imagine that there were only a few channels to, to choose from. 

00:46:00
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:46:00
MICHAEL UNGAR Or, when there was a remote control and you had to negotiate the remote control. 

00:46:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:46:05
MICHAEL UNGAR Well, if you have, if you have all these different televisions then how do we, as parents, and this becomes a clinical issue, how do we help parents structure experiences. So, if kids aren't sharing in their remote control, then are you getting these kids ready to be spouses. I mean, who wants to marry this kind of person? My gosh, who wants to be in an intimate relationship with someone who's never had to share a remote control. They're gonna be hellish to live with. 

00:46:25
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Well, alright. So, so, here's, we have, we're gonna... 

00:46:30
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) So, systemically, it's, yeah. 

00:46:30
RICH SIMON So, so, let's translate. So, we had, just have a little time, uh, we, we're comin' down the home stretch here. So, if, uh, speaking to, again, this audience of therapists who are working with parents and working with kids, and, so, if you're gonna translate in practical terms what we've been talking about. These, uh, this, this idea of the cloistered, what you described in one of your recent papers, the cloistered experience of childhood today, uh, and, and, um, what it means for therapists, and, perhaps, things that, that are somewhat in o-, at odds with the traditional culture of being a psychotherapist. What's your advice, if there are two or three things that you'd, that people, uh, that therapists listening to this might take away that would be of immediate value to them in working with families and working with kids fr-, with a focus on these issues of, um, overprotectiveness, what would they be? 

00:47:30
MICHAEL UNGAR I, I, where my first thought goes to answer that would be to, if we're working with kids that are coming in and presenting a set of disordered behaviors, being that anxiety disorders, or, or, um, running away, either externalizing or internalizing, uh, uh, problems, to not necessarily, uh, think of it as a very centered on the child kind of therapy. But that, in fact, you might be looking at something that's much more systemic, and that the child's behaviors, be they, you know, internalizing or externalizing, may, in fact, be functional to seeking, seeking out reasonable experiences that the child is looking for psychologically and socially to develop this, you know, this, this risk taker's advantage, this opportunity to grow developmentally. 

00:48:15
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:48:15
MICHAEL UNGAR So, I do try to encourage clinicians to think in a more, uh, decentered way. And think about the context in which that particular behavior is manifesting so that we don't treat the anxiety disorder when, in fact, really if you just change the, the challenge structure, the challenge and opportunities that the child has, chances are the anxiety would, would not be so manifested, and the child would learn the skills to cope with manageable amounts of risk over time. Or not pick up from the parents, I'm getting back into that, the anxious parent is downloading some of that onto their child just like the four year old on, on the monkey bars. The second big takeaway, I think that the onus is on us as, as, uh, as therapists, when working, if I shift the focus away from the kid for a minute. Now, I shi-, shift it to the parent, I do think it's about getting into conversations which are much more productive, rather than trying to simply suppress behaviors that are troubling. Um, and that, that really has to do with saying to how can kids getting into yes patterns with their kids. Yes, I see you're trying to grow up, yes, I see you're constantly pushing yourself forward, or wanting to push yourself forward. How do I, How do I, you know, you know, the, the kid is challenging for bedtimes and curfews and all this kind of stuff. Even if they're, you know, 9 or 10, um, how, how do we, um, make sure that the kid has that, those opportunities? So, we're constantly saying, "yes," as, as parents. How do we sort of build that, um, and therefore you're building, uh, cuz I just can't get parents to, to stop overprotection, but I can get them to leave some of that behind once they have something else that they are dedicated to do. I am dedicated to getting my child opportunities to be successful and independent. And, you know, once I'm on that track, that's amazing. You can kinda move people. Um, the third one is often about culture. Uh, I, Rich, I get to travel the globe constantly, and I've gotta tell you I've long ago shed any notion that I can tell another family exactly what is a reasonable accommodation in terms of the right developmental needs for their child. 

00:50:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hm. 

00:50:20
MICHAEL UNGAR Uh, you know, but I always think about, I was negotiating with my own children, a pocket knife. I've seen families they'll do other things, you know, curfews, pocketknives, walking to school, you know, whatever, control over what you're eating, whatever. 

00:50:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:50:35
MICHAEL UNGAR And, um, you know, I was up, way up in the high arctic and watching kids from an aboriginal community, uh, you know, who had just been out hunting at age 11, and skinning their own animals, and, you know, big long knives. And, of course, it's being done in a certain way. They're driving sk-, uh, ski doo snowmobiles, you know, themselves at age 11 and this kind of thing. After a while you being to question your assumptions, and so my, from a clinician's point of view I do think there's a definite onus on asking more than telling. Um, definitely to find what's, you know, what's a normative experience within the culture. And, and my experience is that people are much more likely to accept that from me, to accept that guidance to say, okay, what would be a reasonable rite of passage for your child, in your culture, in your context, um, given the resources that you have as a family? Um, I find that, you know, usually those, those, those types of things that, uh, you know, really turning it into a yes pattern. 

00:51:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:51:30
MICHAEL UNGAR Thinking about the family's um, uh, culture, those are really important, um, aspects of this. And, of course, working with the kids to be a little more decentered in my focus so that I'm not always assuming that, that the problem is, is located inside the child. 

00:51:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:51:45
MICHAEL UNGAR Um, especially in this modern, modern society. 

00:51:50
RICH SIMON Okay. That's, that's great. So that just the, the int-, uh, just, as, as I'm listening to it, just this idea that the, the value of risk, uh, that, that this whole idea of the, the, um, the, the benefits of risk in the development of kids is not a notion that, uh, is a part of my own background. I think that's a really useful concept that, that, uh, stands out along with your, what you're describing is very practical takeaways for this audience. So, if people are, are interested in... 

00:52:20
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) It, it, that's... 

00:52:20
RICH SIMON Yeah, go ahead. 

00:52:25
MICHAEL UNGAR I was just gonna say that it's kinda crazy that we even have to talk about it, cuz it, a, a few generations ago this was a non-issue. 

00:52:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:52:30
MICHAEL UNGAR It's very, sort of, uh, uh, something current, yeah. 

00:52:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah, exactly, so, you know, just sort of these, there are no eternals in family life, and relationship, and couples relationship, certainly. And in family relationships we're always reinventing these relationships with each other as, as the world changes around us. So, um, as you're, um, it, it, and people who are interested in following up on this and finding out more about your work, about these notions about overprotectiveness and resilience and how they can integrate that into their clinical practice, uh, where are, ye-, where can they go to find resources, things to read and other opportunities for training with you? 

00:53:15
MICHAEL UNGAR Um, well, what I, I would direct them first to my website, michaelungar.com, and Ungar is U-N-G-A-R. That's where I would direct them first, cuz a lot of the resources, and certainly my, the list of where I'm speaking across North America or internationally, uh, is listed all there. Um, there was a book I wrote, it's still available, called Too Safe for Their Own Good. They can certainly look that up, and there's lots more academic papers, and, and, uh, references to those. And the-, there's, there are links to those on, on my website. If people are more interested in this notion of reliance, though, I direct them to the research, um, uh, center that I lead called the Resilience Research Center. And, uh, if you just google that that's, uh, that's easy to find. It's just, uh, resilienceresearch.org. But, you know, there's a lot of congruence of say, what I try and do, Rich, is take my, um, and I wear my research hat, but I'm still a clinician. So, I'm always looking at my research and saying, "Okay, so what? What's this gonna mean when I get to open my mouth and talk to a family in crisis with a kid?" 

00:54:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:54:15
MICHAEL UNGAR So, that's really how the two, the two hats have sort of fit together. 

00:54:20
RICH SIMON Great. So, those, uh, again, the, the reminder after each of these, uh, installments of one of our webcasts. The conversation begins here, the real important conversation continues afterwards in the ripple effect. So, to continue the conversation, and also to, to have, uh, observations, share what you've learned that came out of this, certainly questions that came out of what you heard today, just go up to the comment board, you'll see how to do that on the screen. Um, Michael has graciously agree to check it out. He's not gonna write an encyclopedia in response to comments, but I'm sure he'll be curious to hear what you have to say. And perhaps, if you can peak his interests, he'll ac-, actually re-, respond to questions or interesting observations that folks might wanna, uh, just se-, send on in. Uh, but, for now, I'm, that's all we have time for right now. Michael, uh, your, your image may have been a bit blurry throughout this, but your ideas come in loud and clear. Uh, I learned a lot from our conversation. I, I have a hunch that this audience did as well. So, thank you so much. And so that's the... 

00:55:30
MICHAEL UNGAR (crosstalk) A real pleasure, Rich. All the best. 

00:55:35
RICH SIMON That's, that's it from, uh, for us for this afternoon. Uh, take care. See you next time. Bye bye.
