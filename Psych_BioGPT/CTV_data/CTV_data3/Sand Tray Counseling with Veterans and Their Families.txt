Sandtray Therapy for Veterans and their Families Presented by Kristi Kanel, Ph.D. featuring Sheila McCabe, Family and Marriage Therapist Intern 

00:00:00
A Training Video for Counselors 

00:00:00
KRISTI KANEL Hello. I'm Dr. Kristi Kanel, professor at California State University, Fullerton in the department of human services. I have been researching and developing the use of crisis intervention for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or PTSD and other traumas for the past 25 years. I'm interested in developing interventions to assist our returning veterans and their families with their needs and struggles. And I have recently learned of the approach that may prove to be successful with this segment of our population. In addition to more traditional approaches like my ABC model of crisis intervention, I have learned about the effectiveness of sandtray therapy for trauma related disorders. I am pleased to introduce one of my colleagues, Sheila McCabe, a marital and family therapist intern. Sheila has been studying sandtray therapy under the guidance of sandray therapist expert, Dr. Theresa Kestly , Ph.D. This interesting and alternative emersive therapy has shown successful outcomes for those suffering from trauma , grief and loss. Into this program Sheila will provide a brief description of the sandtray therapy and demonstrate this approach with some clients. The first client will be a married couple who have been struggling since the husband was discharged from his service in the Persian Gulf war in the 1990s. He has been working to overcome his PTSD since then. The second client is a female veteran who was sexually assaulted during her deployment in Iraq war. Now I would like to introduce you to Sheila McCabe. 

00:02:15
SHIELA MCCABE Thank you, Dr. Kanel, for this opportunity. Hello, I'm Sheila McCabe. I've been involved in sandtray therapy for several years. It is a projective mode of psychotherapy that facilitates the healing of trauma. In sandtray therapy clients collect objects such as miniatures and other building materials to create a story or scene in a tray of sand. Sandtray therapy is not a short term approach to wellness. It frequently takes 15 or more sessions for lasting results to occur. There are five general phases of the sandtray therapy process. 

00:02:55
Five General Phases of the sandtray Process The Building Phase The Experiencing Phase The Connecting Phase The Photographic Phase The Clearing Phase 

00:02:55
SHIELA MCCABE The building phase, the experiencing phase, the connecting phase, the photographic phase, the clearing phase. 

00:03:05
The Building Phase Typically done in silence while the client selects materials and builds their story. 

00:03:05
SHIELA MCCABE The building phase is typically done in silence when the client selects materials and builds their story. 

00:03:15
3-Part Experiencing Phase Silence Experiencing Client and therapist sit quietly with the story images before beginning to talk about them. Free Association Experiencing Client talks about the story symbols and images. Joint Experiencing Client and therapist explore the power of the symbols and story images together. 

00:03:15
SHIELA MCCABE A three part experiencing phase follows. In the silent experiencing phase the client and the therapist sit quietly with the story images before they begin to talk about them. In the free association experiencing phase the client talks about the story symbols and images. And in the joint experiencing phase the client and the therapist explore the power of the symbols and the story images together. 

00:03:45
The Connecting Phase The client and therapist have a chance to connect to the story themes and images to events that are occurring in the client's life. 

00:03:45
SHIELA MCCABE After the three part experiencing phase comes the connecting phase in which the client and the therapist have a chance to connect the story themes and images to events that are occurring in the client's life. This phase must be approached very slowly and carefully as moving too quickly might disrupt the healing process. It is during this phase that cognitive interventions may eventually be applied, but only after the client has fully processed the powerful story images. A process sometimes referred to as neural integration. 

00:04:25
The Photographic Phase A photograph may be taking for future reference. 

00:04:25
SHIELA MCCABE The fourth phase is called the photographic phase. A photograph may be taken in this phase for future references. 

00:04:35
The Clearing Phase This is always done in the absence of the builder as items are moved back to the place from which they were taken by the client. 

00:04:35
SHIELA MCCABE Lastly, the sandtray therapist finishes with the fifth phase called the clearing phase. This is always done in the absence of the builder as the items are moved back to the place from which they were taken by the client. The neuroscience theory behind the therapeutic benefits of sandtray therapy is that it allows for the integration of the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Often when under high levels of stress, such as during a traumatic event, the natural processes of organizing and processing incoming sensory information into higher order thinking becomes interrupted. This interruption carries long-term implications for a person's state of emotional and mental functioning. In addition trying to cognitively process a traumatic event before the sensory data has had the chance to become fully organized and integrated throughout the nervous system has the potential of further traumatizing the person. Sandtray therapy not only helps to integrate the sensory information and thereby relieve the psychological and physiological effects of the trauma, but with careful application it also helps to ready the client for more cognitive-based and crisis oriented interventions. The use of sandtray therapy with military couples and families can help facilitate healing by bridging the gaps between the individual realities. Because the expression of this story in the sandtray therapy session has a definite here and now quality, it provides couples and families a unique opportunity to establish a sense of having a shared experience that helps to bridge the gap between individual realities. This in turn helps to facilitate readjustment to family and social life for the military member and helps to build understanding and connection between the individual family members and the couple as a unit. 

00:06:45
KRISTI KANEL Thank you, Sheila. As you watch the first session please be aware of how the clients and Sheila work together to assist them in identifying the emotional and cognitive aspects of their struggles. One of the biggest challenges for mental health professionals is helping families adjust to the returning veteran who often feels alienated and lacks a sense of purpose in the family and in society. Although this veteran has been discharged from military service for 20 years, he still suffers from his experiences there. Additionally, his wife and children also suffer. After this session we will discuss the phases of sandtray therapy as related to the session.

Session 1 Couple sandtray Therapy 

00:07:40
SHIELA MCCABE Hello, Kathy. Hello, Tom. Nice to see you today. We've had the opportunity to get together two times already to work in sandtray sessions with both of you present as a couple. In those sessions you worked in separate trays and witnessed each other build your stories. Today we're going to work in the same tray, and I was thinking that maybe you might take one of the images that came forward in Tom's last session of the two circles representing each of you with the overlapping part in the center, being the part where you come together. How does that sound to you today? 

00:08:20
KATHY Sounds good. 

00:08:25
TOM Yeah, it sounds good. 

00:08:25
SHIELA MCCABE Okay, well, when you're ready go ahead and select your items and begin building your story. 

00:08:35
KATHY Okay. 

00:08:35
TOM Okay. 

00:08:40
[music] 

00:08:40
SHIELA MCCABE Okay, if you're ready, you can begin to build. 

00:09:05
TOM Okay. 

00:09:10
[sil.] 

00:09:10
Building Phase 

00:09:10
TOM Okay, so that will be the, okay. 

00:09:35
[sil.] 

00:09:35
TOM Okay, there you go. 

00:09:50
[sil.] 

00:09:50
Therapist shows respect for selected items. 

00:09:50
Silent Experiencing 

00:09:50
SHIELA MCCABE Who would like to begin? 

00:09:50
Free Association Experiencing 

00:09:50
TOM I'll start. Okay. I'll go first. I, uh, I'll start on this end here. This is when I became a Marine. This is at the ready, always ready for anything. And this is the gate that I put up. This represents I guess me getting off the plane coming home in 1991. So, it's a pretty powerful symbol. And then this one back here, broken house, that's what I feel, me as a person, but also, uh, literally my house has been always been disorganized and broken, very very weak foundation. And then because of the path I, I was on after the war and the closed off-ness and the lack of control of basically my emotions, wasn't really consciously in the now, living in the past and all. And this, the three hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. I basically was so afraid to act because of what I had become here in trying to fit back into the civilian world. Those, I compromised my own morals and my own values to just sit there frozen in fear basically. 

00:14:55
Therapist uses minimal encouragers to begin the Joint Experiencing 

00:14:55
TOM So, I didn't do what I had been trained to do the first half of my life. So by, by default the fear went out, and I just sat there frozen. And what I want is a nice friendly gate, and it's open and a nice beautiful house with the garden and everything. Meaning physically, because of the pain I'm in I would like my, my body, my temporary house here to, to be healthy, but also the house for me and my family. And to open the doors to, you know, friends again and have friendly social gatherings that, that don't embarrass her. Or the fear that something might set him off. A car could go back fire on the freeway, sets me off one time and ruined the party. So there's things that weren't in our control outside the house, we slowly, this became stuck. This is the gate that I had, and since I consciously no longer want this but I want that, I have a direction and a goal. And, and the globe obviously, I've been around the globe a lot of places. And I always want that in my life because it's the only, the only planet we have and I want to travel it and learn what it has. And, moving to the center circle the dog tag says for the forgotten, and I sometimes wish I had a photographic memory so I could remember every single name at the War Memorial, but unfortunately I, I can't do that. I'll say yet, because there's always, there's always a way. But I put that on the line because I always think of them, so they are not forgotten. I just can't hold onto all their names, but the essence of every troop in all the wars for whatever reason, just or unjust, but we all get so swept up in how fast society is moving that I don't know how many people take the time to pause and think somebody they knew, a family member or friend or even that friend of a friend, kind of, you know, through here, you know, friend of a friend and then I want to that on the new life I want to make for myself. And I made the circle a little small to overlap. I would have put that in there. But this. I'm still here trying to get there, so I put it. This is, this is the battle that I'm in now. And I put the lamp, because everything is at my disposal. I can create whatever I want with the new, the new world I want in my immediate, my immediate future. And then the crystal, I like that because they have energy. You can positively charge them and they can help. And I definitely want something that came from mother Earth as well as me to help guide me with strengthening my energy and my conviction, my purpose. And then this represents God's hand, this little hand here. I picture myself sitting inside of God's hand, like a hammock. And I just have him create, obviously he's everything, so I created a hand just big enough to hold me as a little infant human. 

00:18:20
Therapist reflects "hands" id. by posing her own hands like the item. 

00:18:20
TOM And that's my, my loop on my half. 

00:18:30
[sil.] 

00:18:30
SHIELA MCCABE So there's a lot going on, on here and you have kind of where you began and where you're heading. 

00:18:45
TOM And I would like to add I wanted to, because of what I've done for the last decade, if I found a man with a megaphone, I would put him in the middle. Because that's what I want to be doing now in the immediate future. No more that. I don't need, I've done more than my share of just sitting quiet. 

00:19:10
Brief Summarization (notice open hand gesture) 

00:19:10
SHIELA MCCABE Yes, this part, this part was, you described it this part kind of like being frozen. But there is a shift from that position now. 

00:19:30
TOM Yeah, there's a strong will, and I just have to find what seems like a very small blockage. But, for whatever reason, it's just powerful enough to keep me sitting on the side. 

00:19:45
SHIELA MCCABE So there's a shift, but there's still something. 

00:19:50
Continues paraphrasing, maintains Joint Experience 

00:19:50
TOM Right. 

00:19:50
SHIELA MCCABE Still something here. 

00:19:50
TOM I think it relies or revolves around the fact that what I was here and this guy. It was basically at this stage, you're a weapon for the government, for your country. But I don't necessarily want to do that anymore. And I'm not in the service anymore so you know, there's a saying, you know, "There's no ex-Marines just former Marines". There's always a connection. I believe that for all the services because of what, made you go in and what you get, what your signing up for to volunteer service. But on the back half when we're done, or they are done with us if you want to say it that way. That's how I feel sometimes. Then they've got to find a place to put us. 

00:20:50
Client describes cognitions and perceptions of the military, movement toward left brain processing. 

00:20:50
TOM There is no real, the money they put in and all the machinery and all the techniques to train you to take human life. On the back half they're not undoing that rewiring. They're not doing the same amount of programming and money to make you a civilian again if you will. And sadly they did that with, uh, I mean, not sadly but for humans. But in World War II they did that in Hawaiian islands. They rounded up all the dogs and made them military dogs and made them killers and bomb sniffers and everything. And, and gave them back to the civilians after deprogramming them after World War II was over. So they did it for a dog, but they don't seem to be doing it quite successfully for the human. So. 

00:21:35
SHIELA MCCABE Yes, so you described, you described this. Tell me that part again. To this, when you were describing. 

00:21:50
Therapist seeks further clarification of some items to help move into connection phase. 

00:21:50
TOM This is Ruby I became after high school. I went in the Marine Corps. And I was ready for anything and everything. And. 

00:21:55
SHIELA MCCABE And you said that, that they made you into. 

00:22:00
TOM A killer. Right. So they made, they rewired me, you know, the programming. And, it's powerful but I think, I think it's for as long as we have countries, will have armies for them countries. And I think that it's, and it's an all volunteer source. Our country is still all volunteer. Other countries you have to. 

00:22:25
SHIELA MCCABE And is there a connection for you between, between this place and this place? 

00:22:35
Connection phase begins as therapist seeks connections from client. 

00:22:35
TOM I think that's where I started. I can remember some, some happy childhood memories. The gate I put up somewhere after 1991, the summer of 91 was one of the harshest I've had. I think that gate, you know. 

00:22:55
SHIELA MCCABE Are you talking about right here? Are we talking about right here? 

00:23:00
TOM Yeah, no. The state. 

00:23:00
SHIELA MCCABE This gate. 

00:23:00
TOM I, I have childhood memories of that scenario, even my dad making the fence in my front yard. But in this one, I put up voluntarily because I didn't want anybody in. And now I have to. 

00:23:15
Helps interpret this connection 

00:23:15
SHIELA MCCABE Does this, this gate has a purpose. It sort of stands between, stands in front of this part which you described as being, as being a kind of broken side of you. 

00:23:30
TOM Right. A physical body but also the literal my homes with my marriage and our family. We have kids now. But look what it's protecting though. I mean, what is it protecting? So I've got to take this down. Right? And I can reuse these, recycle . Yeah. 

00:23:55
Client connecting past to present and future 

00:23:55
SHIELA MCCABE And, and I'm going to save this part to do after Kathy has told her story. 

00:24:10
White begins her Free Association Experiencing 

00:24:10
KATHY This is, this represents our home. And, we love the beach. I thought that was a good symbol there. And I chose the stones with peace and pray and laid them in front because, uh, I feel like I'm always praying for peace in our home. And I kind of feel like were always praying for that. 

00:24:40
Free Association triggers right brain activity, begins to feel emotional pain. 

00:24:40
SHIELA MCCABE [inaudible] peace in your home. 

00:24:45
KATHY I feel like it's a constant, uh, something we have to work on. And, uh, the, the American flag is, is kind of behind our home but it's the basis, and it's what we, it's just such a big part of who we are. And, I think there's some conflict there about him serving and us loving our country and what it, what his service did to him and to us. 

00:25:35
Joint Experiencing as Therapist reflects. 

00:25:35
SHIELA MCCABE So there's conflict. 

00:25:40
KATHY Yeah, yeah. 

00:25:40
SHIELA MCCABE So it means a lot. 

00:25:40
KATHY It means a lot but there's, there's conflict there. 

00:25:45
Encourages more perceptions by clients 

00:25:45
SHIELA MCCABE Tell me more about that. 

00:25:45
KATHY It's just, I'm not sure how to describe it. It's, it's the feeling like I love my country but it's upsetting what he goes through because of his service. And because we're living it day to day every day, and it affects me. It affects our kids. It affects them obviously. 

00:26:10
SHIELA MCCABE And so, describe this part as, as a fight, what you're both fighting for. 

00:26:25
KATHY Fighting for. 

00:26:25
SHIELA MCCABE Peace in your home. 

00:26:25
KATHY Peace. Yes. Peace within him. Peace within me. With our kids. Within our home. And it just kind of feels like were always having to work at it. But notice we are not laying down. 

00:26:50
[sil.] 

00:26:50
Therapist allows herself to experience items, reflects on clients perceptions and interpretations. 

00:26:50
SHIELA MCCABE This brings up a lot for you. 

00:27:10
KATHY Yeah, yeah. It's been a lot of years. And we've learned a lot through this about each other, about PTSD, about, uh. 

00:27:25
TOM Triggers. 

00:27:30
KATHY Triggers. And about how courageous he is to get help for it. Because I think, and I've told them before, that he's braver at home than he was over there. 

00:27:50
SHIELA MCCABE And that, that brings up a lot. 

00:28:00
KATHY Yeah, because I know he struggles with that, that stigma of getting help. But we wouldn't be here where we are now had he not got help. If he wasn't brave enough to accept therapy and accept being able to talk about what he's been through, I don't even know that Tom would be here because it was that bad. And it's still hard, but we are still here. 

00:28:45
SHIELA MCCABE It's, it's part of what you're fighting for. 

00:28:45
KATHY Absolutely. 

00:28:50
SHIELA MCCABE It's part of that peace is within the home. 

00:28:50
KATHY Absolutely. 

00:28:50
SHIELA MCCABE It's also within the environment, the unitary(ph) environment. 

00:28:55
KATHY Oh, yeah. It's not, you know, it's not normal, normal, you know. No balloons at birthday parties, the backfires of cars, no fireworks shows. It's definitely not the normal, typical American family, but I'm still, I still wouldn't change it. I'm still very thankful for everything we have. And I'm so thankful that he's gotten help. 

00:29:25
Therapist seeks further explanations to prepare for the Connecting Phase. 

00:29:25
SHIELA MCCABE And so tell me, Thomas shared with us here this part. So, you tell me. 

00:29:40
KATHY That kind of leads to us remaining in acceptance. Uh, this is our family. We've got two kids. They're still young, seven and four, so that kind of spoke to me like that was us and sticking together. 

00:29:55
SHIELA MCCABE So, this is you. 

00:29:55
KATHY This is us, yeah. 

00:30:00
Asks about feelings. 

00:30:00
SHIELA MCCABE Sticking together. How does that feel? 

00:30:05
KATHY Great. Safe. 

00:30:05
SHIELA MCCABE That feels good. That feels safe. 

00:30:05
KATHY That safe. 

00:30:05
SHIELA MCCABE That feels safe. 

00:30:10
KATHY This doesn't feel safe. That feel safe. And we are not always there, because we're sometimes here, but we always get there. And it may not be 24 hours a day, but we always make our way back to that and, and with God, and that's why I put the cross and the Bible, because our faith is very strong. And our love for God and our love for each other is represented in that stone. And the blessings plaque is to remember that we are blessed, and, and the sea shells and starfish, this reminds me of sea glass. It's just something that makes me feel peaceful. And I really like the beach. And our kids love going to the beach and collecting shells. And that's, that's just a big part of our family. And we go to the beach and it's nice to, it's just a good place for us to go and relax. So. 

00:31:10
SHIELA MCCABE So, this is like a resource spot for you. This is where you feel strong. 

00:31:15
KATHY Yeah. Definitely. 

00:31:15
SHIELA MCCABE You feel that peace. This is where your, where you're fighting for that peace. 

00:31:20
KATHY That's right. That's right. 

00:31:25
Summarizes and interprets, moves into Connecting Phase. 

00:31:25
SHIELA MCCABE And, and this is your fight as well. To kind of get here, which ultimately needs to be in here. 

00:31:35
TOM Yeah. 

00:31:35
SHIELA MCCABE And to experience the world in a way that you described, to go visit all the different places you've already done that a lot. And it's something that still means a lot to you. 

00:31:55
Client continues the Connecting Phase 

00:31:55
TOM Yeah. Well, I traveled it with a weapon in my 20s. 

00:32:00
SHIELA MCCABE You traveled it with a weapon. 

00:32:00
TOM So I'm going to travel it without one. 

00:32:05
SHIELA MCCABE Without a weapon. 

00:32:10
[sil.] 

00:32:10
TOM And I might add I like the one box. I do. Having done the separate. 

00:32:35
SHIELA MCCABE You like the feeling of doing it. 

00:32:35
KATHY I do too. 

00:32:35
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. 

00:32:35
KATHY I do too. 

00:32:40
SHIELA MCCABE So this felt good today, to be in the same box together. 

00:32:45
TOM Even if it was rotated, like if we did one where, cuz I got a lot of pieces one of the times. So we didn't need the more room, but. 

00:32:50
KATHY I like, I like the way this felt. 

00:32:55
SHIELA MCCABE Maybe a bigger box. 

00:32:55
TOM Yeah. 

00:32:55
KATHY Yeah. 

00:32:55
TOM This is nice. 

00:32:55
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. So, anything else that you'd like to add today? 

00:33:05
KATHY No. 

00:33:10
TOM No, I'm good for today. Thank you. 

00:33:10
KATHY Thank you. 

00:33:10
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. Thank you. Um, I know you like to usually take a picture of your tray and take it with you, so would you like to do that now? 

00:33:20
KATHY Yes, please. 

00:33:20
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. 

00:33:25
Photographic Phase 

00:33:30
[sil.] 

00:33:30
SHIELA MCCABE Now that the clients have left, we begin the next phase which is the clearing phase. The purpose of clearing the tray after the client has left is so that the client may leave and carry their story with them. The story is a very sacred story, and the therapist now becomes the keeper of that story and holds that space closely for the client. 

00:34:10
[music] 

00:34:10
Clearing Phase 

00:34:10
KRISTI KANEL Well, thank you Sheila. That was a wonderful, very powerful session. I do have a few questions that, that interested me. And perhaps the audience would be interested in some of these as well. The first thing I wanted to know during, regarding that building phase. How long does this usually lasts and does it include both selecting items and placing them in the sandtray? 

00:34:45
SHIELA MCCABE Yes, the building phase does include both of those phases. 

00:34:50
KRISTI KANEL And what is your experience. What are you thinking about as they are selecting items and placing them? In particular can you, can you orient it towards Tom and These session today? 

00:35:00
SHIELA MCCABE Sure. The therapist, this is a very important role for the therapist because this is when the atmosphere of protection and safety needs to be established. And the therapist is playing the role of the witness. And they are engaging very intently by watching everything that the client is doing. So the items that they're choosing, the items that they're studying, maybe perhaps picking up putting down, staying away from even, and ultimately the items that they are, that they are picking and bringing forward and placing in the tray. 

00:35:35
KRISTI KANEL What did you notice particularly about Kathy and Tom's placement and selections? 

00:35:40
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. Well one of the things I noticed is that they were both deeply engaged in the process. Uh, Tom spent a lot of time studying each of the items that he chooses and goes deep, deep, deep into that, which tells me that he's connecting very deeply with these images. And Kathy has a very serious approach of building this story that has a very deep meaning to her. And so for both of them, that's what I, you know, notice about their process. 

00:36:15
KRISTI KANEL Okay, thank you. Then the next phase, the experiencing phase, I noticed there was some silence. During that beginning silence what were you thinking about as he sat with Tom and Kathy during that beginning silence phase? 

00:36:30
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. This is a time when you take in the images. And by having that moment of silence you're sort of giving pause and reverence to the symbols and the story that's being told. And you're allowing the client to have these images reach them at a deeper level. And this is where the real work, the therapeutic work, begins to take place. 

00:36:55
KRISTI KANEL Okay, I noticed that during, when you went through that free association part of this experiencing, he mentioned something about a car backfiring had set them off. And I noticed that was perhaps a sign of some PTSD. And I noticed that doesn't get directly expressed by you, but instead you reflect and summarize. Can you talk a little about that technique? 

00:37:20
SHIELA MCCABE Sure, sure. One of the things I want, I wanted to be very careful of was, was holding Tom within a window of tolerance so that he did not become over activated in the sympathetic nervous system, become activated. So, uh, I was just witnessing and holding that message that he was giving us and reflecting a little bit about what some of his trauma has meant to him. 

00:37:50
KRISTI KANEL Then I noticed when he moved into the connecting phase, and, uh, you know, there were some connecting between the gates. Can you share a little bit about what you felt were some of the connecting you did during that phase with Tom and/or Kathy? 

00:38:05
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. Uh, so there is, there was a lot of, gates are always a very very important. Uh, I think the image of the ruin for Tom, the house that was the ruin and how he connected that. And again, me reflecting that is just validating and helps the client to go deeper and experience that are fully. Again, experiencing the images and the story that's being told is very important for the therapeutic process. Connecting the different things that are happening within the tray, such as when Tom, when we referred to the, the soldier and, and then going to the hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. I connected it to, to that froze in place that he described that. But he went to the gate beyond it, which I felt was significant for him. So I wanted to then go then go ahead and reflect that as well. 

00:39:05
KRISTI KANEL Did you find any connecting with Kathy? 

00:39:10
SHIELA MCCABE And for Kathy, I think it's very very important for Kathy that this image of her being a warrier in this family as well. You know, in one of the last sessions it came up with that there's more than one soldier in this family. And, and I think that the connection that was made there in recognizing that and validating that and honoring the role that she plays within their family as fighting for that peace every day as she described it. 

00:39:45
KRISTI KANEL And, and just to sum up a little bit, you mentioned earlier in your introduction how this model, you know, triggers both the right hemisphere of the brain and the left hemisphere. And that the goal is to, for the left hemisphere to integrate it all, and it's motivated to do that. Can you talk a little bit about in this session what parts do you think were more right hemispheric and which, when did we move into left hemisphere? 

00:40:10
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. Well, the whole storytelling process, the building process is all very right hemisphere. This is the symbols and images coming forward. And the process of beginning to talk about that and what that means is what helps the brain integrate that into the left hemisphere, because that's where the cognitive piece. 

00:40:35
KRISTI KANEL But do you feel there was some integration during the session with Kathy and Tom? 

00:40:40
SHIELA MCCABE Absolutely 

00:40:40
KRISTI KANEL What would you say would be the, the pronounced integrative component that you saw? 

00:40:45
SHIELA MCCABE Every time that they were able to look at the story images and talk about it in a way where they were making that connection and using language to, uh, describe how this shift, how this is being seen in their life now. So how these images are playing out of their life and the impact. So when they make the connection to the PTSD and the birthday parties and, and, you know, the gun, the car backfiring. 

00:41:15
KRISTI KANEL What really struck me is when he said he traveled the world with a weapon. Now he wants to travel it without. 

00:41:20
SHIELA MCCABE Absolutely. 

00:41:20
KRISTI KANEL That was awesome. 

00:41:20
SHIELA MCCABE It was a beautiful moment, yeah. 

00:41:25
KRISTI KANEL Well, maybe we'll end our discussion on that beautiful moment. Thank you. 

00:41:30
SHIELA MCCABE Thank you. 

00:41:30
KRISTI KANEL In our second session, you will observe a female veteran struggling emotionally due to her sexual assault while serving in Iraq. I encourage you to watch how this client still struggles with many social stigma, psychological challenges, and emotional blockages. Because military culture has not been successful in helping these types of survivors of sexual assault, they need to seek help from those who understand their complicated needs and issues. After the session, Sheila and I will discuss these issues as related to the session.

Session 2 Individual sandtray Therapy 

00:42:10
SHIELA MCCABE Hi, Tania. Thank you for being here today. 

00:42:15
TANIA You're welcome. 

00:42:15
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. So you and I have met a couple times for some previous sessions. And in one of the sessions we did a sandtray, and in the other session we just talked a lot. But I wanted to invite you today to build another tray. Okay? 

00:42:35
TANIA Okay. 

00:42:35
SHIELA MCCABE So whenever you're ready, go ahead and select your items. 

00:42:40
[music] 

00:42:40
SHIELA MCCABE So whenever you're ready, go ahead and build your story. 

00:43:25

00:43:25
Building Phase 

00:43:25
Silent Experiencing Phase 

00:43:25
SHIELA MCCABE Whenever you're ready you'd like to tell me your story or about your world. 

00:45:40
Free Association Experiencing Client shares her perceptions 

00:45:40
TANIA Okay. Well, I get all of my guidance from the Word of God. So, that's how I am able to go day to day and keep living and not kill myself. And Jesus is my rock. And then this mirror here, and this mirror is, I see this distorted picture all the time. I'm not even really aware that it's distorted, and I just feel ugly all the time, most of the time. And I can relate to, uh, this guy, the hunchback because, you know, he had real beauty in that movie and nobody else in that movie had real beauty except for only a couple people. But, all of his strength and absorbable qualities were completely like shit on. And then, over here is this really pretty place, nice place that I kind of just feel like it's freedom. This is, this is where I feel beautiful. And it's just a place that's not in the world, and I can't get it from the world. And, you know, puppy dog, innocent and real sweet, and that's kind of that place. And then this stove, I'd like to be able to live off the grid and get away from everything and everyone. And I like motorcycles, and I associate that to freedom as well. And this "True Grit" movie poster here, I guess that's kind of like maybe there's some prideful reasons why I move on too, because I don't want to be a sissy la-la. So I try to be like that. Strong. And this "Live, Laugh, Love" thing, I have a hard time relating with it, and I kind of don't see my life that way. And I don't understand why people say that. There's so many beautiful things in the world, you know, and they start crying. And I really just don't agree with them. I think the world is shitty, and when we are, when we don't have to be here anymore we'll all be relieved. And over here is this, this flag which is a crock of shit. It doesn't mean shit. It's just used to shrinkwrap peoples brains. And then there is a Humvee. I used to work on Humvees and things in the military. I was a mechanic. And I relate a lot of my insecurities to some of that to being incompetent on the job. And then I also relate a lot of my strengths to that for when I was competent on the job. And then this, this ugly looking skull like soldier face is just showing what war is, and that it's completely useless and retarded. And all the soldiers just being soldiers. I like soldiers. And I remember 9/11, this is another crock of shit because as far as I'm concerned 9/11 was an inside job. The government bombed its own self for its own political motives. And the whole war is a war for profit by corporations. And then here's this highly competent soldier that's doing great things. Well not really, because he's just a pawn, but I still want to be, I want to be this competent person. And I don't feel like I am. And then, you know, I resort to marijuana and beer and food to, to kind of like self medicate or whatever you want to call it just so I don't have to deal with the way I feel about all these things. 

00:49:55
[sil.] 

00:49:55
Therapist Reflects to move into Joint Experiencing 

00:49:55
SHIELA MCCABE Yeah, that's a lot to deal with. That's a lot. So, you mentioned drawing a lot of your guidance from, from here. Can you tell me more about that? 

00:50:30
Seeking further explanation of items 

00:50:30
TANIA Yeah, I believe that the Holy Bible is not a science book. It's just, you can answer any problem with that book. That book will give you wisdom and insight. 

00:50:45
SHIELA MCCABE Wisdom and insight. 

00:50:45
TANIA It's a living book. It's alive. So, that's where I get my strength. 

00:50:55
SHIELA MCCABE This is where you get your strength. 

00:50:55
TANIA Yeah. 

00:51:00
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. And this is where you would like to the, in some sort of a beautiful place, but it's not really here. 

00:51:15
TANIA No. 

00:51:15
SHIELA MCCABE Tell me more about that. 

00:51:20
TANIA Well, it could be here. I could become a hermit and live off the grid and have a farm. I guess I would like to do that one day. 

00:51:30
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. So to get to this place means that you need to be alone somewhere? 

00:51:35
Clarifies, asks for connections of items to complete joint experiencing and move into Connecting Phase 

00:51:35
TANIA Not necessarily, no. Just with like-minded people. 

00:51:40
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. Like-minded. What is the feeling like in this world? 

00:51:50
TANIA It feels like just being out in total nature where nothing's corrupted, and it's all just God, I just feel the love of God in that kind of area an environment where it's just, everything is perfect and beautiful. 

00:52:05
Asks about emotions. 

00:52:05
SHIELA MCCABE Okay, okay. So it feels, it feels pure. And like something like a trust. I sense a trust here, where you can just sort of trust this environment. Off the grid. 

00:52:25
Brief reflections 

00:52:25
TANIA Off the grid to where I don't have to rely on the government or anybody to live, to survive. 

00:52:40
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. And that's, that's, that feels the opposite of that to you. That feels the opposite of being able to trust or feel like it's pure. 

00:52:55
TANIA I feel like I'm being controlled when I'm on the grid. And they won't let most people get off the grid. They don't want that, so. 

00:53:05
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. So, a very strong sense that something is controlling you and other people around you. 

00:53:15
TANIA And a lot of that's just my own brainwashing, my own thoughts control me and cause me to be immobilized. And that's when I feel really screwed up. And that's when I cry because I feel like, I feel like, I see myself as a strong person who doesn't take any crap, but then all of a sudden I find myself in a situation where I can't move and I'm obeying somebody who is wrong. And I feel incompetent, and I can't believe I'm doing that. 

00:53:50
SHIELA MCCABE And where, where is that part connected to what's happened during the story? 

00:53:55
TANIA That's the struggle, the battle that I'm going through. I can't really spend all my time here, so I have to go out into the world and fight the good fight. And you know, pursue whatever I feel like God wants me to do. And so, I want to do that, and I'm trying but sometimes I become immobilized. And then I feel like there's no hope and I'm always going to be incompetent, and I'm never going to be able to be strong independent person. 

00:54:30
SHIELA MCCABE Is there, is there an image here that reflects that feeling of the mobilization? 

00:54:40
TANIA Not really. 

00:54:45
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. 

00:54:50
TANIA Maybe some of these leaders that I have in the military and also in the civilian world just people that I don't think they know what they are doing. Some people do. But they are just, they act diabolicly evil, even in just daily dealings. And, those people are very cunning and they are like snakes. And they seem to entrap me sometimes when really I could just crush them because they are so retarded and weak. 

00:55:25
SHIELA MCCABE They need to be under there. 

00:55:25
TANIA They, they are like, they're not following the Word, so they are going to fall. But I don't, I see them as strong, stronger than me. Like this guy, so I become intimidated by them, and I just kind of become immobile sometimes. 

00:55:40
SHIELA MCCABE So, they're not really strong, but somehow. 

00:55:45
TANIA I believe that they are. 

00:55:50
SHIELA MCCABE Sometimes you get that belief. 

00:55:50
TANIA Yeah. 

00:55:55
SHIELA MCCABE And what's the feeling now that that, that one is under there, you said crush him and put them under there. 

00:56:05
Client shares a change in her perceptions and feelings - integration of left and right brain activity 

00:56:05
TANIA It's clear, and clarity. That illusion is not there. I just got rid of it. 

00:56:15
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. 

00:56:25
[sil.] 

00:56:25
SHIELA MCCABE And you mentioned also that this figure over here is, is really the figure that you would like to be. 

00:56:45
TANIA This one? 

00:56:45
SHIELA MCCABE Mm-hmm. 

00:56:45
TANIA Yeah. Because he's, he's a go to guy, and he's really strong. And people need him to do things that are important and good. And he knows how to use all his equipment. And he's competent. And he can help people. 

00:57:10
SHIELA MCCABE He can help people. And that's, that's how you want to feel. 

00:57:20
TANIA Mm-hmm. 

00:57:25
Therapist offers a connection 

00:57:25
SHIELA MCCABE And is there a time in your life when you feel like that? 

00:57:30
TANIA Sometimes. It's pretty rare lately. But I hope to feel like that again soon. All the time. Most of the time. 

00:57:45
SHIELA MCCABE So, tell me, tell me a little bit about this, this part right here. 

00:58:00
Therapist seeks further connection of items to client's thoughts and feelings. 

00:58:00
SHIELA MCCABE You were saying that this is how you feel most of the time. 

00:58:05
TANIA Yeah, I feel like I don't see my worth and value most of the time. But sometimes they do, so I could relate to that guy because he, he has a lot for going for him. He's really smart. He's a good person. He's really strong. But because of the way he looks and his, his disability, you know. And it's like I'm a woman, so because I'm a woman automatically I'm disabled in a certain sense. And my appearance just causes people to respond to me in a certain way. That isn't necessarily conducive to my best interests or healing my own issues. But, you know, if I looked like this guy I'd probably have a whole different slew of issues, you know. But maybe not, you know. I don't know. 

00:59:05
Therapist paraphrases client's perceptions 

00:59:05
SHIELA MCCABE So, so this, this guy. He's kind of misunderstood by others. People don't see his value, don't see his worth. But he actually has a lot to offer. 

00:59:25
TANIA Yeah. He's overlooked. Yeah, he has a lot to offer, more than most people because most people, they don't have good intentions. 

00:59:40
SHIELA MCCABE And in this part over here, you mentioned that that's associated with some behaviors that you have that are sort of coping mechanisms, self-medicating. 

00:59:55
TANIA Yeah, and I don't like them. And it makes me feel really bad about myself when I do those things. 

01:00:00
SHIELA MCCABE So those, those you don't feel good about. 

01:00:00
TANIA No. 

01:00:05
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. And there was a lot of anger here as well, I thought. 

01:00:15
TANIA Fraud. 

01:00:15
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. That's associated with something very painful for you? 

01:00:20
Reflects anger and connects it with patient's pain 

01:00:20
TANIA Everything on the planet that's going on for the most part that you see on TV is related to just the selfishness and fraudulent behavior and lies and everything, so that's what I think of when I see that. 

01:00:40
SHIELA MCCABE And your experience of having served has influenced those feelings. 

01:00:50
TANIA Yeah, just because I see how much people are getting screwed because of the war. I got screwed a little bit, you know, maybe. 

01:01:05
SHIELA MCCABE So, for you there was a feeling of having gotten screwed. 

01:01:05
TANIA I feel like I was being screwed by being born on the planet. 

01:01:10
Reflects client's perception - connects it with deeper issues 

01:01:10
SHIELA MCCABE So this runs really deep for you. 

01:01:15
TANIA Yeah. 

01:01:15
SHIELA MCCABE Yeah. Yeah. 

01:01:20
TANIA But, it always goes back to God. He's got a higher purpose, and I think one day I'm gonna not look at it this way. I'm going to be able to feel happy, you know, and actually relate to this "Live, laugh, love" kind of ideal people talk about. Sounds kind of hilarious to say that right now, but. 

01:01:40
SHIELA MCCABE But, it's a little bit of a goal perhaps. 

01:01:45
TANIA Yeah. 

01:01:45
SHIELA MCCABE That you're working towards. 

01:01:50
TANIA Just to survive. 

01:01:50
Client demonstrates some integration by sharing her coping strategy to deal with pain 

01:01:50
Photographic Phase 

01:01:50
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. Thank you. Did you want to take a picture of your tray or do you want me to take a picture for you? 

01:02:10
TANIA You can go ahead and take it. 

01:02:10
SHIELA MCCABE Okay. 

01:02:15
[sil.] 

01:02:15
KRISTI KANEL Well, that was quite an impactful session for sure. So many emotions came up. Sheila, I'd like to address a few issues with you that struck me while I was watching. So you mentioned, you know, at the very beginning of the session that you had spent one session doing kind of talk therapy with her and another session in sandtray. Uh, just wondering how much time is spent in a sandtray approach doing more traditional psychotherapy methods? 

01:02:45
SHIELA MCCABE Well, it completely varies per client. Some clients will come in and they'll expect do a sandtray as soon as they walk in the room. And other clients will want to do it every so often. And other clients will want to maybe suddenly break in the middle of a session and, and take an issue that they're talking about and express it in the tray. And so it totally varies, but I would say that on the average it's probably about one third of the time doing sandtray and then the rest of the time doing traditional talk therapy. 

01:03:20
KRISTI KANEL Uh, during the course she had said that she kind of uses God to help her not kill herself. That struck a, a chord in me was during a sandtray approach would you do a formal suicide assessment with a comment like that? 

01:03:30
SHIELA MCCABE Of course, that's always a part of any traditional psychotherapy, and that has been gone over extensively with this particular client. 

01:03:40
KRISTI KANEL Another thing that she said that struck out to me, when she said, "I feel ugly." I was wondering would you ever ask her why she feels ugly? How would something like that be handled? 

01:03:50
SHIELA MCCABE Well, I wouldn't necessarily use that particular word or phrase to ask her why she feels ugly. But I might refer her back to the images that's in the tray and say, "So, this particular image then has a very ugly feeling?" Because the images are what is going to help her with making that therapeutic shift, relating, how that relates to the images. 

01:04:20
KRISTI KANEL So everything gets focused back onto the images, and, and tie that in. 

01:04:25
SHIELA MCCABE Yes. And let her, let that lead her. 

01:04:30
KRISTI KANEL Is that part of the connecting process, connecting herself with the images then? 

01:04:35
TANIA Mm-hmm. 

01:04:35
KRISTI KANEL Uh, the other thing I was noticing is the type of relationship that you might be creating with her. How would you describe the relationship between a sandtray therapist and their clients, and how was it created? 

01:04:45
SHIELA MCCABE Well, the most important aspects of the sandtray therapy process is that the client feels extremely safe. And that there's a protected, you know, unconditional rapport with the client and the therapist. And I think that's true for all therapy sessions, and it's extremely true for sandtray. In order for the client to work through traumatic images, traumatic events and memories, they have to be able to be safe in order for those images to come forward, and for them to be able to really fully experience them and to go deeply into them. And that will affect their selection of their images, the placement of their images and the things, the way they connect with the images and are able to facilitate and integrate in a therapeutic process. 

01:05:40
KRISTI KANEL So it sounds like, if I could, kind of a typical humanistic type of relationship. 

01:05:45
SHIELA MCCABE Yes. 

01:05:50
KRISTI KANEL Fairly Rogerian(ph). 

01:05:50
TANIA Yes. Fundamental. 

01:05:50
KRISTI KANEL Right. You know, one of the, during the time she said, you asked her about a specific image, and she said, "It's clear now, the illusion. It's not there anymore. I just got rid of it." I had my, in my head I was thinking is that integration? Was there some kind of, you know, left hemispheric integration with that right hemisphere at that moment? What are your thoughts on that? 

01:06:15
SHIELA MCCABE Uh, I think it's a little bit hard to say at this moment. I didn't get a chance to explore that's enough with her, and I think that I would look, I would notice that and I would hold that and look for further exploration with her on that. Because it's possible that that is, that's not exactly what's going on either. It could be that there's a little bit of defense mechanisms happening there were something else. It's, I would just want to look into that more with her. 

01:06:45
KRISTI KANEL Yeah, right. I noticed she brought up the thing about being a woman, and there was so much going on. It must be difficult that there's so many things to be explored there. How do you pick and choose? How do you know what to delve deeper into? 

01:07:00
SHIELA MCCABE Right. Uh, that's, that's something that has been explored, and I, I told her I would let her lead that in terms of how far she wanted to go into certain things and so. 

01:07:20
KRISTI KANEL Absolutely. Yeah I noticed. 

01:07:20
SHIELA MCCABE That was a sensitive issue for her, so I let her lead the way. 

01:07:25
KRISTI KANEL Yeah, because I noticed that in both sessions that you conducted today that the particulars of trauma, the particular traumatic aspects of war, their military service, that those weren't directly discussed or dealt with. Is that like a typical tradition or is that going to happen a lot in sandtray, you don't have to talk directly about trauma? 

01:07:45
SHIELA MCCABE Right. You don't want to jump into it too quick. You don't want to move toward to that, those kind of questions too fast. The whole idea behind sandtray is that your, your seeking nervous system regulation and integration, the recovery from trauma. So in order to do that there has to be a lot of safety, and you have to move slowly so that the client can bring forth the images from the right hemisphere of their brain that, that are connected to the traumatic event and gradually regulate those images. Over time they will piece together those images like trying to put together a puzzle. And that's how the nervous system heals. 

01:08:30
KRISTI KANEL Well, it was, was certainly impactful. Both of these sessions were very powerful. And I want to thank you so much. 

01:08:35
SHIELA MCCABE Thank you. Thank you for having me. 

01:08:40
KRISTI KANEL Thank you, Sheila, for demonstrating this model. Please keep in mind these were brief demonstrations, and that in practice this type of therapy would normally take place over several months and several sessions. The process we've seen demonstrated is very intensive, and we can see that over the course of several sessions that clients who have been exposed to trauma will be encouraged to experience their emotions in a way that allows cognitive connections to those emotions. Hence, creating integration. While the focus of this video was on military trauma, this approach will be appropriate for a variety of clients. Often traumatized clients resist traditional talk therapy due to their fears of reliving emotional pain. Having an alternative approach such as sandtray therapy could be quite helpful for some mental health professionals. I would like to thank Sheila McCabe and the brave people who participated in this video. It is my hope that many clients will benefit from this work. I'm Dr. Kristi Kanel.
