RESILIENCY AFTER VIOLENT DEATH: LESSONS FOR CAREGIVERS A PRODUCTION OF GIFT FROM WITHIN TED RYNEARSON, MD 

00:00:00
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Hi, my name is Ted Rynearson, Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Washington, Medical Director of the Homicide Support Project at the Virginia Mason Medical Center in, uh, Seattle, Washington. Violent death accounts for eight percent of annual deaths nationally, and it's the leading cause of death for those under the age of 40. Unlike natural dying from disease or old age, loved ones bereaved by violent dying such suicide or homicide are left with a narrative dilemma to tell two contradictory stories; the re-telling of their loved one's life that's precious and the re-telling of the external drama of their loved one's violent dying that's horrifying. For some, the re-telling of their dying may eclipse the re-telling of their living. This program demonstrates how to shift the psychological focus from the drama and the spectacle of violent dying or loved ones stuck in their bereavement and to shift the caregiver's attention to the longer-term psychological and spiritual needs of loved ones months and years after the violent death. 

00:01:20
MARY WALKER TOM AND LAURA YARBOROUGH 

00:01:20
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Our purpose is to provide clinicians, social workers, clergy, and caregivers engage in long-term support with families after violent death helpful strategies to diminish the emotional distress of violent dying bereavement. A panel of experts considers two case studies from videotaped interviews with patients I treated after the violent deaths of members of their families. Mary Walker, a 67-year-old retired special education teacher, had four children three of whom died violently. She first consulted with me 23 years before this interview, shortly after the first death, the homicide of her eldest son which led to the disintegration of the family. Ms. Walker had no history of emotional difficulties prior to the deaths of her children. Laura Yarborough, a 56-year-old retired nurse, and her husband Tom first consulted with me 14 years before this interview when their 17-year-old daughter was murdered, a murder that remains unsolved. Like Ms. Walker, the Yarboroughs had no previous history of emotional difficulties. But unlike Ms. Walker's family, the Yarboroughs were able to summon a great deal of support for one another. 

00:02:35
DR. TED RYNEARSON  The panel discussion is divided into three sections corresponding with three common psychological responses to a violent death. Uh, the responses roughly follow a predictable order and occur in variable combinations. Phase one, intense separation and trauma distress. The immediate challenge following the violent death is overwhelming distress related to both the reality of death or separation distress as well as the reality of violent dying, trauma distress. Avoidance alternates with waves of intense distress in this early phase of a combination. But a vulnerable minority of loved ones remains highly avoidant and distressed. The mothers and children of the deceased are particularly vulnerable to prolong an intense distress. 

00:03:35
DR. TED RYNEARSON Phase two, reframing dying and nurturing imagery. The next challenge involves revising and synthesizing the traumatic memories of the killing with the nurturing memories of the deceased. Imagery related to the killing, reenactment, remorse, retaliation, retribution and dread of recurrence alternates with imagery related to the nurturing relationship, longing, searching, rescuing, reunion. A vulnerable minority of loved ones remains possessed by intense dying and/or nurturing imagery. 

00:04:20
DR. TED RYNEARSON Phase three, meaningful reengagement. A later challenge is in establishing the meaningful reconnection with the flow of life beyond the tragedy or violent death by a hopeful recommitment with valued activities and relationships.

 Our panelists include Dr. Charles Figley. Dr. Figley is a psychologist, family therapist and professor at the School of Social Work at Florida State University; Dr. Alison Salloum is with the clinical faculty of the Department of Psychiatry at Tulane University; Janice Harris Lord is a social worker and a fellow in thanatology with the Association of Death Education and Counseling, and Dr. Ted Rynearson, clinical professor of Psychiatry at the University of Washington. 

00:05:15
A DEFINITION OF SHOCK INTENSE SEPARATION AND TRAUMA DISTRESS 

00:05:15
MARY WALKER  Uh, in my spiritual life, I learned, I've, I came up with a definition of shock and, uh, it's God's way of preserving us so that life can go on. Uh, and shock to me is not something that it's initial(ph), it's, uh, it can, it, kinda it's brought on by an initial trauma but it is something that helps you to maintain your cognitive even though your emotional might be gone astray. Until I came to you, I think for like 12 or 13 years, I had been in shock, and I didn't realize how unbelievable violent crime can be to anybody. The divorce as to separation, the running away, the, all of this is that somehow my life had suddenly changed. 

00:06:40
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Well, just "my life is changed." I mean, it sort of all of a sudden, oh, out of the blue without any preparation. I mean, it certainly started with uh, the, the violent deaths but it just, it's almost like it's, it's a waves of disaster and difficulty that were starting. It's also like throwing rock in a pond and there's this initial wave, but then everything shifts and changes. Very difficult. And it's almost like when does this gonna be over? It's like a nightmare. 

00:07:10
JANICE HARRIS LORD Uh-hmm. 

00:07:10
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY  And no one really understands unless they've gone through something like this. 

00:07:15
JANICE HARRIS LORD Uh-hmm. I think she teaches us a couple of things in that arena. First of all, as mental health professional as she's talked about shock, uh, we all tend to understand that, "Oh, well, I know what chemistry was going on in her brain, then." Now, the fact that she interprets... (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yes. 

00:07:35
JANICE HARRIS LORD ...it as a gift from God, that allowed her to at least go through the motions of going to work doing what she need to had to do, is fine. (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
 Uh-hmm. 

00:07:40
JANICE HARRIS LORD  If that's her understanding of it, great. But the downside piece is that by pretty much disconnecting from life in order to cope the family fell apart. 

00:07:55
 Yeah. 

00:07:55
DR. ALISON SALLOUM And she, she has this perspective now. But I think about, I know she was raising two young children, and they're kind of going through the, the waves in the transitions of all the, the changes that are taking place in the family. They might not have that perspective uhm, but yet they're being constantly effective but, affected by all of the changes. 

00:08:15
DR. TED RYNEARSON Avoidance has a purpose. Uh, it's important not to clinically uhm, or uh, uh, pastoral dare to challenge uh, avoidance uh, so you know the person well enough that you can replace it with something that's more effective and that, (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
 Uh-hmm. 

00:08:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON  that takes time. So that there's something very healthy about this response unless it goes on for years the way it did to Mary or Ms. Walker. 

00:08:40
DREAMING AND RELIVING MEMORIES INTENSE SEPARATION AND TRAUMA DISTRESS 

00:08:40
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Uh, dream. So the two of you still dreaming about her, her? 

00:08:50
LAURA YARBOROUGH  Once in a great while but not like I used to, no. I used to relive her death in my dreams, in a dream that I was, she was calling out to me and I couldn't get to her and that sort of thing and that I rarely have that or if I do, I don't remember it. 

00:09:15
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh-hmm. 

00:09:15
LAURA YARBOROUGH  But I still have that kind of experience when I'm not dreaming. Sometimes, I don't know, it's just someone is wondering about her last moments... (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh-hmm. 

00:09:25
LAURA YARBOROUGH ...and that's always really painful. 

00:09:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON In this, uh, segment, she's making a reference to what she went through during, during the initial months of, uh, of high distress, high trauma distress. And, uhm, one of, uh, the people from my office was working with home visits with the children, uh. As I recall, she came in to see me several times, uh, to work specifically on the traumatic, uh, sort of imagery that she was having on a daily, uh, sort of basis. That's what brought her into, uh, to work with me. And we worked very specifically, uh, with some strategies, uh, to help her to stabilize herself as she would feel overwhelmed by these imageries in terms of diverting her mind from it and being able to calm herself and being able to put words, uh, to some of the, the imagery. This was, uh, one of the tragedies that this crime was, there were a very few details. Uh, nobody was there, uh, to witness it and no one was ever, uh, uh, apprehended so she was left with her own vivid fantasies, uh, an imaginary sort of reenactment, which wasn't buffered, uhm, by any sort of, uh, uhm, external, uh, affirmation of, of what had gone on which made it more difficult for her. 

00:10:50
 Yes. 

00:10:50
JANICE HARRIS LORD Ted, one of the things you taught me years ago through workshops or writing or something was that when people don't have the detail and the facts, they tend to make them up, and often, the imagery in their mind is actually more painful... (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
 Yes. 

00:11:05
JANICE HARRIS LORD ...than the real experience. But I think the teaching point there is for those people who do have the facts, uhm, whether it's the medical examiner or the funeral home or the law enforcement investigator or whoever it is, when family members want that information, they should probably be more forthcoming than they sometimes are with sharing that information with the families who want it, not before the trial when it would put things in jeopardy but after that process is over. These things are incredibly important to families. 

00:11:45
DR. TED RYNEARSON I couldn't agree more. And I, I, I get upset when I hear, uh, the legal authorities saying that they're not sure giving this information to, uh, the family members after the trial in an effort to psychologically protect them. 

00:11:55
 Yeah. 

00:11:55
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Uhm, and that's, that's a lame excuse, uh, because this is something the family rights, a family member, as I said, have a right too. 

00:12:05
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yeah. 

00:12:05
DR. TED RYNEARSON This is their information, uhm, and that gets often very helpful in, uh, helping them to, to accommodate, uh, a lot of their fantasies. 

00:12:15
DR. ALISON SALLOUM And children have a right to that information as well. You know, family members, being loving and, in protecting, trying to keep that information away but you're absolutely right, Janice, is that they, they do have wild imaginations and in horror, uhm, trying to put together a story, a narrative about what may have happened to their loved one and that can be very scary for a child. Uhm, also I know Ted, you've taught a lot about this, with the fantasy of retaliating and some families are actually having a plan...(crosstalk) 

00:12:45
 Uh-hmm. 

00:12:45
DR. ALISON SALLOUM ...to, you know, the fantasy and then many people have fantasies about what they would like to do or see done, uhm, and that can be discussed in a safe environment. But I think there are also, we're saying a lot of retaliation is taking place where people are carrying that out... (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
 Uh-huh. 

00:13:00
DR. ALISON SALLOUM ...and so it's important in a family context to talk about that openly and for family members, uhm, to say to one another, uhm, that's, that's not how our families is gonna handle it. That doesn't bring honor to our family or to the young 14-year-old boy who may have the fantasy of retaliating and carrying a gun to say to that child, uhm, that's not how we're gonna handle it. I can understand those feelings. I had those feelings too but, uhm, the consequences of then another child dying is really great. 

00:13:35
PAINFUL MEMORIES INTENSE SEPARATION AND TRAUMA DISTRESS 

00:13:35
LAURA YARBOROUGH  Sometimes people ask me about her, or ask me details about, "Oh, how did your daughter die?" and that's always painful, and it's hard because it's upsetting to them, and you don't know how much to say or not say or how to say it in a way that's, and that, that's, that's hurtful. I have a picture of her in my office and I had some guest that walk in the office, asked who that is and I'd say, that's my daughter. Inevitably, it was, not always, sometimes they'll start asking more questions and I've almost thought about taking the picture down but I can't quite bring myself to do that. It's, yeah, that didn't, this is too hard for me. It's just too overwhelming. 

00:14:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Just, uh, in reference to the question I asked again about, uh, the internalization of sorrow and the, uh, whether it was still tinged with a lot of uhm, traumatic, uh, distress and it is, uhm, they always will be. Uhm, uh, and I think to be able to normalize that with, with family members, uh, as Janice was talking about, but also I th, I think it brings up the whole issue of the media and what the media is doing with the spectacle of violent death, uh, particularly the local news ... (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yeah. 

00:15:10
DR. TED RYNEARSON ...which a lot of us don't watch anymore because, 50 percent of the local news are now deals with, uh, violent dying. I think because of the, of fallback of avoidant response that we go through nor biologically the violent death that the media is capitalizing, uh, on this. Another concern that happened have definite effect, social effect in terms of inuring, uh, to violent death. Even though the frequency of violent death is diminishing in our country, the reporting of it, uh, in the media, uh, and also in a lot of the, uh, plots of uh, TV shows is going up. 

00:15:50
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY The thing that, that I'm struck, uh, with, with this couple is the difference, the similarity certainly between the couple with regard to their feeling at peace, uh, working on the Bed and Breakfast together, uhm, working cooperatively, they're uh, very wonderful and loving couple but yet they're different. And it appears that for her, she's more fragile than he is to the extent that, that, uh, she, when she watches the news, it reminds her, it upsets her and it doesn't with him, I don't think. And that's the thing that so important is to, to tolerate that difference, to recog, to honor those differences and to not, as a couple, push either, uh, you know, the husband shouldn't push the wife vice versa to, to think like they do, to perceive things like they do, to get over things like they do because sometimes, it, it's, it's, uh, upsetting for the person who has achieved a certain degree of normality or, uh, or, uhm, peace when uh, their mate hasn't and the, the sense of, uh, you know, making them feel guilty about this. And that's really when they can, uh, take advantage of counseling or at least turning to other people who, who can be neutral and to enable them to talk about it without shutting each other down. 

00:17:15
CONCEPT OF DEATH REFRAMING DYING AND NURTURING IMAGERY 

00:17:15
DR. TED RYNEARSON  What about your three children and, uh, the other people that died, do you think that they still exist at some level? 

00:17:30
MARY WALKER I think they are asleep. 

00:17:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON Okay. 

00:17:30
MARY WALKER  Uh, because in my belief system is that there is a second coming of Christ to receive us. I, I don't believe in the fact you die and go to heaven. I, I don't believe that and that's one of the differences in the religions that we have. Uh, I believe that we go to sleep. We, we enter into a rest. We go in rest until the time comes when we go to be with the Lord. 

00:18:15
DR. TED RYNEARSON This is, uh, she was answering a very specific question that I will, uh, bring up with any family member early on in our work together which is their concept of death. Uh, one of the things that, uh, happens after, uh, uh, the death particularly if somebody has died traumatically. Uh, many people have, uh, belief system that the spirit, uh, is no longer trapped in this traumatic narrative but has transcended. It is in a more peaceful sort of time and place which is very, very, uh, comforting in terms of belief systems. 

00:18:55
JANICE HARRIS LORD I think in terms of, uhm, Mary Walker's experience, yes, she was comforted somewhat by that, you know, peace is better than violence or nothing. But what I find fascinating is that I, I believe that what she was speaking of there was her own faith community's doctrine. And what we see as we move on into learning more about Mary Walker is that she is indeed having some kind of communication with her children now or perceiving that, that she is connecting with them spiritually. She talks about how when she's in trouble, she feels like Warren comes to help her and so forth. So there's often a, a really significant transformation between the doctrine that someone grew up with and learned in quotes and then what their personal experiences as they actually go through trying to figure out how to cope with the violent dying of someone they love. 

00:20:05
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY  Uh-hmm. You know, very much a transformation. Yeah, I, the, I was, I, I'm, have been impressed with her with regard to her spirituality and the, the sense of comfort that it gives. And she's not shy at all of saying that's not what I believe...(crosstalk) 

00:20:25
JANICE HARRIS LORD Uh-hmm. 

00:20:25
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY I believe this and that's great and it indicates that she has come a long way... (crosstalk) 

00:20:30
JANICE HARRIS LORD Uh-hmm. 

00:20:30
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY ...in terms of, you know, what is doctrine and what I feel in my heart and hopefully and it seems that way that that's helping her a lot in overcoming this. And then the concept of death. Most people, as you all know, avoid thinking about death... (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
 Uh-hmm. 

00:20:45
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY ...and then suddenly they're forced to think about it and in ways that are very graphic and especially in terms of violent death. And uh, it's, it's, it's almost as if we all need to be thinking about this... (crosstalk) 

00:21:00
JANICE HARRIS LORD Uh hmm. 

00:21:00
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY ...before we're forced to think about it. But it, it's another example of, of this metamorphosis of, uh, how it was in the beginning. It's very different than how it is when they come through the other... (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:21:10
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY ...side as she has. 

00:21:10
DR. ALISON SALLOUM Yeah. I. (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
JANICE HARRIS LORD  Also, and I wonder if you could address the, the adolescent piece on that. (crosstalk) 

00:21:15
DR. ALISON SALLOUM I've got. 

00:21:15
JANICE HARRIS LORD Uh, my experience has been that adolescents are just trying to figure out how in the heck to do life. 

00:21:20
DR. ALISON SALLOUM Right, right. (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
JANICE HARRIS LORD And then all of a sudden they've got to deal with death and it's extremely chaotic. (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
DR. ALISON SALLOUM Yeah. But I really, I really listened to how she explained her beliefs, um, about death and I think language is so important with, with children and with adolescents when parents teach their children their... (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
DR. ALISON SALLOUM ...own beliefs and she said, you know, my belief is that they rest until it's their time. And I think about young children hearing that who are, and how scary that may be. Well, if I rest, will I die too? (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yeah. 

00:21:50
DR. ALISON SALLOUM Which is a, uhm, a real worry for children when someone dies in, uhm, violently or, or dies by natural causes. Is this gonna happen to me, (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:21:55
DR. ALISON SALLOUM ...is this gonna happen to you, will this happen to my parents? What does it mean to rest and so it is so important for Ms. Walker and, and other parents who've had children, uhm, are raising children to be open to not only teaching their beliefs but allowing children to question and to ask questions or what do you mean by that. Just to be very open in communication about beliefs and allowing children to, to question it because they don't understand it. 

00:22:25
JANICE HARRIS LORD Uh-hmm. 

00:22:25
DR. ALISON SALLOUM And as adults we don't, sometimes, you know, really understand... (crosstalk) 

00:22:30
JANICE HARRIS LORD Uh-hmm. 

00:22:30
DR. ALISON SALLOUM ...and allowing that for children it's critical. 

00:22:30
SPIRITUALITY REFRAMING DYING AND NURTURING IMAGERY 

00:22:30
MARY WALKER  He said, well, tell her it's all right. 

00:22:45
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

00:22:45
MARY WALKER At that time my spirituality is, tell her it's all right. And I said, "What do you mean it's all right?" Well, tell her that her daughter is all right that as she was on, in her last breath, she was talking to God and she was saying, "Dear Lord, please take care of my children. Just take care of my children." And there is something in the Bible that says, "They that call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." I believe what the Bible says and I believe I had an answer to my prayer. 

00:23:40
DR. TED RYNEARSON And your daughter did too in those last moments. 

00:23:40
MARY WALKER In those last moments. 

00:23:45
DR. TED RYNEARSON I think this, uh, this speaks to the comforting, uh, uh, belief system that she has in terms of softening the horror and the helplessness of, of her daughter's violent death was that, uh, somehow she made a connection, uh, with, uh, divine and a very forgiving peaceful way as she was, uh, dying with this message, uh, to take care of her, uh, to take care of her children, Janice(ph), uh, sustaining for Ms. Walker. 

00:24:20
DR. ALISON SALLOUM Uh-hmm. 

00:24:20
JANICE HARRIS LORD You can tell the poignancy of her emotional reaction right there that this was incredibly important for her as a, as a new awareness and a new spiritual experience. 

00:24:30
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yes, it also speaks to the notion of, of encouraging them to speak because they have the answers. I mean, (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
 Hmm. 

00:24:35
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY  with, with your work, Ted, you enable them, you facilitate them but basically they're doing the work. And her coming to that perspective is incredibly important and, you know, if there's any, uh, among the things that we hope, uh, the viewers of, of, uh, this tape or, DVD will think about is to not impose around perspectives and not impose their reframe uh, to not even apply what they have learned if they survived a violent death but instead uhm, be there with them and enable them to come to their own conclusions and the struggle. 

00:25:15
DR. ALISON SALLOUM Ms. Walker had this, this gift at the end about her belief about her daughter's last words as she was dying. And I think for many children and, (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
 Hmm. 

00:25:25
DR. ALISON SALLOUM ...and families, I mean, that's, that's a struggle... (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
 Yeah. 

00:25:30
DR. ALISON SALLOUM ...and the pain of the, of the horror and how they died at last moments. 

00:25:30
JANICE HARRIS LORD  I think a very strong teaching point from this segment is that those people who are there at the end and have anything positive to say whether it was the doctor in the emergency room or the EMT in the ambulance or the police officer, if there was anything positive and affirming to say, family members are going to be longing for that kind of information. 

00:26:00
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY This, this comes through uhm, very, very clearly when, um, troops die in action and the, the surviving families. Uh, nowadays, the common thing is to tell your buddies, if I die, tell my parents, visit my parents, (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
 Hmm. 

00:26:20
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY ...tell them what happened. And most frequently and automatically, they emphasize the positive. (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
JANICE HARRIS LORD Uh hmm. 

00:26:25
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY They emphasize, uh, the bravery, etc., because families are just so hungry to know somehow even if it's negative, even if it's gory. Uh, they wanna know as much as they possibly can. 

00:26:35
JANICE HARRIS LORD That, what a great point that is, too, because I think sometimes people are tempted to lie, to embellish it... (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yes. 

00:26:40
JANICE HARRIS LORD To make it better than it was. And then in cases of violent death, you always get caught in that. (crosstalk) 

00:26:50
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yeah. 

00:26:50
JANICE HARRIS LORD I mean, there is a trial, there are autopsy reports, there are all kinds of things and a family can feel incredibly betrayed... (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yes. 

00:26:55
JANICE HARRIS LORD  If one of the caregivers said she didn't know what hit her or something like that. (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:27:05
DR. ALISON SALLOUM Uh hmm. 

00:27:05
JANICE HARRIS LORD And then they hear the testimony in court or they read the autopsy report. 

00:27:10
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Right. 

00:27:10
JANICE HARRIS LORD So very good point. People can handle gory stories if they're the truth. 

00:27:15
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yes. 

00:27:15
JANICE HARRIS LORD Much better than they can handle being lied to. 

00:27:15
THE DEATH WAS EXTERNAL REFRAMING DYING AND NURTURING IMAGERY 

00:27:15
MARY WALKER  The thing was that after all of these things that happened, I guess my greatest grief was there must have been a reason, and, and, and I think it's comes from religious teaching from years back that when bad things happen to you there must been a bad cause to cause all of this to happen. And part of psychotherapy did this was to bring me to the point of seeing that what happened to me was external. It happened out there rather than in here. 

00:28:05
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Ms. Walker is, uh, is talking about a dilemma that many family members, uh, uh, go through not only what this might represent psychologically about, uh, her internalized uh, guilt and maybe ambivalence, uh, but also that the death was external. Uhm, that violent death occurs at a time and a space, in an action that's outside of us and that's very different than a natural death which is going on inside which is invisible, it's not intentional, it's not of, uh, uh, associated with negligence, uh, the way an external violent, uh, uh, does this. So that I think that this helps to explain why particularly mothers, uh, uh, who are so engaged in, uh, care giving and that sort of obligation to their, their child that when something goes on external uh, like this that, uh, they feel that it somehow should have, uh, been, uh, been avoided that it was their fault. Uh, and the only way that they're going to resolve this is to somehow make some sort of external change rather than being able to, to look at their own needs and their own feelings which with, with therapy she was finally able to, to uh, revise her identity to the extent that she could begin expressing another part of herself that had been pretty suppressed. 

00:29:30
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yeah. You, you did some great work with her and it really shows the, that the real challenge in terms of, of, ri, figuring out that it is internal, that is my belief in what happened, is great but in families, it's very, very challenging because sometimes beliefs are different. 

00:29:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:50
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY And it's almost like it's restorative and healing when you figure out all of these. But then your spouse or one of your children have a different belief and they're sort of afraid of challenging your belief but it's inconsistent with theirs. So there is this struggle within families for that sort of, at least a common perspective. It doesn't damage other people in the family. 

00:30:15
DR. ALISON SALLOUM  Uh-hmm. 

00:30:20
JANICE HARRIS LORD I think you can see that from a spiritual perspective as well which plays right into the conflict within the family and that, um, a lot of very faithful people believe that if they have given as much of themselves as they understand to as much of their faith as they understand then therefore, everything that happens to me must somehow be within the range of God's will for me and then something awful happens and that makes no sense so you got to try to reconfigure your theology and, and a lot of people at some point decide, no, God didn't do this. The drunk driver did this or the murderer... (crosstalk) 

00:31:00
DR. ALISON SALLOUM Uh-hmm. 

00:31:00
JANICE HARRIS LORD ...did this or somebody else did this and, and that becomes a very useful and very freeing theologically. But within a family, you may very often have people sticking with that internal peace and then others have moved to the more external peace and chaos can reign. 

00:31:25
DR. ALISON SALLOUM And people might not realize that even the, the four-year-old child may be thinking that I caused this to happen... (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yes. 

00:31:30
JANICE HARRIS LORD Oh, for sure. 

00:31:30
DR. ALISON SALLOUM That, that, sometimes it's really overlooked by the adults and the family might have a mother feeling guilt or somehow this occurred because of what I did or I didn't do and not realize that even the, the young child can be having some of those similar internal struggles and challenges. (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
JANICE HARRIS LORD Uh hmm. 

00:31:50
DR. ALISON SALLOUM And so, how wonderful for Ms. Walker to recognize and come to that place, uhm, with herself. 

00:31:55
SPIRITUAL BELIEFS REFRAMING DYING AND NURTURING IMAGERY 

00:31:55
MARY WALKER  It bothered me the way they died but I have, you know, I've had visions of, you know, sweet visions of them in heaven somewhere and not that I believe that, you know, it's kind of this whole thing about death, getting back to death, about this restful sleep and this being with the Lord. Uhm you, it's, it's almost so, it's like, uh, uhm, uh, it's such a reality that you can almost put it into reality that even though you said, somebody said, well this hasn't happened yet but it is so real that it has happened. 

00:33:00
JANICE HARRIS LORD I just love that, it's the, it's her reframe out of her own experience, you know. This is where she's trying to say, "Okay, this is what I think I'm supposed to believe but this is my real experience." And the great news is she's, she's owning her own realistic experience. She's not sticking with the teaching but she's, you can see her just trying to work it through. 

00:33:25
DR. TED RYNEARSON She was, uh, talking, uh, after I'd asked her another, uh, rather specific question that I tried to ask family members, uh, early on in treatment which is, uhm, trying to clarify what's going on internally, uh, relative to the image of the, of the dead child. (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:40
DR. TED RYNEARSON  So I was asking there specifically, uh, about the memories that she was having of these, uh, these three children and whether they were comforting, uh, sort of memories or whether they were still, uh, uh, traumatic. And that's, I think, very important for, uh, anybody that's trying to work supportively with family members afterwards. To, to be focused on what's going on internally with the memory systems that are, uh, pivoting around the, these very, very, uh, important self, uh, self objects, uh, that there, they're, they're still trying to accommodate to the trauma and the, the death. And I ask about that directly. And to engage, uh, that memory, uh, sometimes in a conversation, I, it's not uncommon for me if I know the first name of the person that's died like Warren, and we're stuck at some point in therapy to ask Warren's help. What would Warren say would be helpful to us, uh, at a time like this... (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Nice. 

00:34:40
  like this. To sort of triangulate the work so there's not just between the two of us but we're bringing in this other memory system, uh, in a supportive reinforcing restorative, uh, uh, way. So, uh, don't dismiss what's going on, uh, internally. It's very important to focus on. 

00:35:00
JANICE HARRIS LORD Just in terms of strategies I think it's a common strategy in grief therapy to suggest that people do journaling and even write letters to their loved one. But I think we might miss the boat sometime by not suggesting that they allow those loved ones to write back to them... (crosstalk) 

00:35:20
 Uh, uh hmm. 

00:35:20
JANICE HARRIS LORD ...as well because they often get a lot of affirmation and surprising uh, understandings and interpretations when they can be free enough to just go with that kind of an exercise. 

00:35:35
UNEXPECTED MEMORIES REFRAMING DYING AND NURTURING IMAGERY 

00:35:35
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Oh, I'm just trying to focus on Sarah and the way that you're processing your memory of Sarah now is that uh, tells us there's something that, uh, isn't with him every day. 

00:35:55
LAURA YARBOROUGH It's, it's not with me every day but it will come unexpectedly at moments that I don't anticipate. I have a, uh, lady who's helping me at the Bed and Breakfast who has young children. She has a two-year-old that she has to bring to work with her. She doesn't have day-care. She's kind of adopted me as her grandmother because she doesn't have a grandmother. I, holding her in her my lap sometimes and she's going to sleep in my arms and it is, you have that point and your feeling of remembering Sarah at that age and having a daughter and, and combing her hair and sorts of things and all since she was our only daughter. 

00:36:40
DR. TED RYNEARSON She was at a portion of, of the interview where I was again asking directly about, uh, something internalized memories of, of, of the person who had died uh, violently in an effort to see whether that's a peaceful sort of memory or whether it's still associated, uh, with a lot of, uh, trauma, uh, distress, uh, and a sort of bittersweet, (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:37:05
DR. TED RYNEARSON I think, relative to it being triggered not only by the mem, memory of Sarah but by the little girl that sits in, in her lap. Uh, uh, it's bittersweet for me in terms of listening to it, anyway. 

00:37:20
DR. ALISON SALLOUM Uh hmm. 

00:37:20
JANICE HARRIS LORD I like to, to call those grief spasms because, uh, something can trigger it... (crosstalk) 

00:37:30
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yeah. 

00:37:30
JANICE HARRIS LORD ... and it comes up with such poignancy and yet it doesn't mean that there's anything wrong. You know, for Mrs. Yarborough uhm, if she wound up crying a little bit as she brush that child's hair or whatever, that doesn't mean she's suddenly thrust into a depression or whatever. It's simply a very natural reaction to such a poignant thing having happened to her. And I think, uh, clergy, mental health professionals, anybody can do a great service by just naturalizing those kinds of experiences for people and letting them know that that's just the way it's gonna be for the rest of their lives that these pieces are gonna pop up. They may be wonderful memories, they may be tinged with sadness or with bitterness or with loneliness but you wouldn't be having those if you hadn't loved this person so much in the first place. So to, to reframe that into, uh, into a positive feeling. 

00:38:30
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DEATH MEANINGFUL REENGAGEMENT 

00:38:30
TOM YARBOROUGH  And, uh, I haven't really, I guess, they're, they're through it all. We've not been, like, I suppose, immediate Christians. We haven't been too concerned about Sarah. She, she's fine but uh, what about the rest of us? We got to keep on struggling here so that's been in a nutshell. Do you want to add anything to that? 

00:39:00
LAURA YARBOROUGH  I just remember saying one time I want Sarah back and you, I remember you saying, "How cruel would that be to bring her back here. She's much happier where she is now." 

00:39:15
TOM YARBOROUGH We think. 

00:39:15
LAURA YARBOROUGH  Yes. That will happen. We believe she's with God and that we'll see her again someday... (crosstalk) 

00:39:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:39:25
LAURA YARBOROUGH ...so I think that helps sustains us. 

00:39:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:39:30
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY It's so wonderful to see them smiling and happy and reconnected, have a sense of meaning. But this was years later. Ah, and uhm, Ted knows because he's worked with them that it took a long time. But it's so wonderful to have a sense that even though it's so painful for Sarah to not be with them and missing out on all the things that she could do with them that she's in a better place. I mean, for them to come to that conclusion is, is just so gratifying and it gives so much hope to other people who, who don't feel that way at all about their loved one. 

00:40:10
JANICE HARRIS LORD I'm so glad you brought up the time issue, Charles. (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Hmm. 

00:40:10
JANICE HARRIS LORD Because, uhm, a problem that I find with a lot of faith leaders... (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Uhm. 

00:40:15
JANICE HARRIS LORD  is that they push for that conclusion too quickly... (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
 Yeah. 

00:40:20
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yeah. 

00:40:20
JANICE HARRIS LORD  and it's a real slow tough process to get there. (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yeah. Uh hmm. 

00:40:25
JANICE HARRIS LORD  Now, when you're in the midst of your turmoil and somebody says, "Well, you know you should just be happy because she's in heaven with God." (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yeah. Oh boy. 

00:40:35
JANICE HARRIS LORD You know it's the most discounting thing in the world. 

00:40:40
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yes. 

00:40:40
JANICE HARRIS LORD So, thank you for bringing up that time issue. 

00:40:45
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY You know, there's something wrong with them if they don't... (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
JANICE HARRIS LORD Yeah. 

00:40:45
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY ...just move on. Or that they, they're, I'm sorry, that their faith is, is lacking or something. (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
JANICE HARRIS LORD Is, that's right. Yeah. 

00:40:50
DR. ALISON SALLOUM I was gonna say, you may see children right after playing, or they appear to be happy. 

00:40:55
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY  Uh hmm. 

00:41:00
DR. ALISON SALLOUM Where there are other moments where they may be very sad, or very angry, or, or... (crosstalk) 

00:41:00
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:00
DR. ALISON SALLOUM  isolated and sometimes that can be confusing because adults, or religious leaders, or... (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY  Uh hmm. 

00:41:10
DR. ALISON SALLOUM ...community members may say, "Oh, they're really doing well." You know, they're out playing. They're back engaged in sports... (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:15
DR. ALISON SALLOUM ...and that's helping them to sustain themselves... (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yeah. 

00:41:15
DR. ALISON SALLOUM ...and to be resilient at the same time. (crosstalk) 

00:41:20
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:20
DR. ALISON SALLOUM Uhm, kids go back and forth often from being able to play, which is a gift and to experiencing profound sadness and sorrow. 

00:41:30
CHILDREN MEANINGFUL REENGAGEMENT 

00:41:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON  As I recall, Sarah is ol, I mean, the older, oldest of the three children, is she? (crosstalk) 

00:41:40
TOM YARBOROUGH Uh hmm. 

00:41:40
LAURA YARBOROUGH Hmm. 

00:41:40
DR. TED RYNEARSON She had, she had a pretty positive nurturing sort of role within the family, haven't she? 

00:41:45
TOM YARBOROUGH  Yeah. 

00:41:50
LAURA YARBOROUGH Yeah, she was. Ah, she was the, the peacemaker. 

00:41:55
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

00:41:55
LAURA YARBOROUGH You know, boys and ah, she was the gentle one, so. 

00:42:00
TOM YARBOROUGH She was the best person in our family. I think our oldest would tell you that, character and just her general demeanor, the way she dealt with people for whatever reason that this relation turned out. 

00:42:15
DR. TED RYNEARSON Well, the two of you must have had something to do with it? 

00:42:15
TOM YARBOROUGH Oh, no. 

00:42:15
LAURA YARBOROUGH  We're not sure about that. 

00:42:20
TOM YARBOROUGH Yeah. We don't know that. 

00:42:20
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Well, we're sure about that. 

00:42:20
DR. ALISON SALLOUM Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:42:20
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY  It's very clear that they are a very loving and supportive family and it's so, it's so nice that they see Sarah as the best person in their family and, uhm, and hold them, hold her with such love in their heart. And to recognize that she is alive, I mean, to the extent of her spirit and her memory and her, her position within the family, ah, she's an inspiration to all of them. And at the same time though, it makes the loss even larger, but somehow they are able to balance that with the, the sense that she's with them all the time. 

00:43:00
THERAPHY, FAMILY, WORK MEANINGFUL REENGAGEMENT 

00:43:00
MARY WALKER  The marriage that I had with Argus(ph) really made my life a little different. That starting a new life with a new person, someone who loved me and loved my children and loved my family uhm, made life easier for me. The other that was helpful to me was the fact that I was in a profession, teaching, that was very, very nurturing and encouraging. I had good principles. I had good friends, and we're still good friends, and ah, they were able to encourage me and keep me going. 

00:44:00
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY  You know, friends and, and colleagues are so important. It's mentioned in, in, with both of the families. And it, the, the, the difficult part, of course, is how reluctant some people are to say something for fear that it will make it worse and sometimes it does. I mean, both or all three of, of ah, those that, the, the family has talked about that. But the, the sense that ah, you're not alone is so important. 

00:44:30
JANICE HARRIS LORD Uh hmm. I remember a line from ah, Nicholas Wolterstorff's wonderful book "Lament For A Son," (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
 Hmm. 

00:44:35
JANICE HARRIS LORD where he says, "Just come sit with me on my mourning bench." 

00:44:40
DR. ALISON SALLOUM Hmm. 

00:44:40
JANICE HARRIS LORD  You don't have to know what to say. You don't have... 

00:44:45
DR. ALISON SALLOUM Yeah. 

00:44:45
JANICE HARRIS LORD ...to be an expert, just be with me. And that's, that's such a wonderful advise. 

00:44:50
 Hmm. 

00:44:50
DR. ALISON SALLOUM If I think about how important it is for, for adults and parents and uhm, caring, caring people to sit with the children as they're grieving, to, to, to be there...(crosstalk) 

00:45:00
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Uh hmm. 

00:45:00
DR. ALISON SALLOUM ...and to notice and to support and, uhm, not necessarily to say a lot, but to listen and to respond to, uhm, how they're feeling. 

00:45:10
JANICE HARRIS LORD Hmm. Alison, thought a lot of families send the smaller children away, because they're afraid they can't cope and then that winds up... (crosstalk) 

00:45:20
DR. ALISON SALLOUM, Right. Trying to protect them. 

00:45:20
JANICE HARRIS LORD ...being a disaster. Uh hmm. 

00:45:20
DR. ALISON SALLOUM Trying to protect them out of, uhm, wanting them to be okay. But, yeah, what it does is it, it isolates the child. 

00:45:30
JANICE HARRIS LORD Uh hmm. 

00:45:30
 Hmm. 

00:45:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON The other ah, difficulty I think that could go on with, uh, support of friends and families is if the, uh, traumatic narrative persist, (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:45:40
DR. TED RYNEARSON and the person needs to retell this over and over again and becomes obsessed and possessed with it, that people around them get very tired of them. 

00:45:45
JANICE HARRIS LORD Uh hmm. 

00:45:45
 Yeah. 

00:45:45
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Ah, and they can't listen to it ah, anymore. (crosstalk) 

00:45:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:45:50
DR. TED RYNEARSON I think it's one of the things that, uh, will bring family members in for some support, uh, in counseling. 

00:45:55
JANICE HARRIS LORD  You know I found ah, that putting folks in that situation in a group can be really useful because when they tell the story, if they simply see the other people in the group nodding in understanding, somehow it becomes validated... (crosstalk) 

00:46:15
DR. ALISON SALLOUM Hmm. 

00:46:15
JANICE HARRIS LORD ...and you find them not having to tell it again, and again, and again, and again, looking for someone to validate it... (crosstalk) 

00:46:20
DR. ALISON SALLOUM Hmm. 

00:46:20
JANICE HARRIS LORD ...when they know they're in a safe place in that group, with people who do have some understanding of what they've been through, and it, it can be a real cathartic thing. 

00:46:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

00:46:30
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY  Sometimes it's also uhm, helpful to encourage the person to use other forms of, of telling the story. Uhm, art, poetry, uhm, sculpture, that sort of thing. Because it, it's, I think part of the retelling of the story is hoping that this next time it will all make sense. 

00:46:55
JANICE HARRIS LORD Uh hmm. 

00:46:55
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY This next time, uh, I'll let, I'll let go. Almost hoping that there's going to be some cure to telling the story, but it doesn't happen. And, uh, so they need some other additional ways of telling. 

00:47:05
MARY'S MINISTRY MEANINGFUL REENGAGEMENT 

00:47:05
DR. TED RYNEARSON  It sounds to me as if, uh, in terms of your ministry, uh, that this has become very, very meaningful kind of activity for you, now. In terms of connecting others with something that you found to be so personally meaningful, your story. What is, what does your ministry consist of? (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:47:37
MARY WALKER My ministry, basically, is I do a lot of funerals, pastoral care. 

00:47:50
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY I do a lot of funerals. My sense is that she's not afraid of death now. She recognizes it. She, it, it, I, it seems like her calling is to look into the eyes of someone who lost somebody and say, "It's okay. It's, it's horrible now, but it's gonna get better." And... (crosstalk) 

00:48:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:48:10
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY ...to do the things that, that was helpful for her when she was going through those multiple ah, deaths. 

00:48:20
DR. TED RYNEARSON But she's also, I think, uhm, engaged in ministry, uh, which brings a sense of resilience, not only to, to others, but to herself. (crosstalk) 

00:48:30
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Yeah. 

00:48:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON  And that's so important to recognize that. One of the most important sources of resilience is being resilient for others. 

00:48:40
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:40
DR. TED RYNEARSON Parents being resilient for small children, Ms. Walker being resilient for other bereaved uh, parents and that there's something purposeful and meaningful about that sort of activity. Uh, and in terms of ensuring uh, stability and proximity uh, and safety at this, uh, that, that comes with that sort of ministry uh, or that sort of nurturant, uh, uh, activity, and the importance of reengaging... (crosstalk) 

00:49:05
 Yeah. 

00:49:05
DR. TED RYNEARSON  uh, uh, in that. (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:49:12
JANICE HARRIS LORD Elie Wiesel, a, a holocaust survivor says that the best way to deal with a person's despair is for them to reach out to someone else in despair. Uhm, and I think there is some crucial timing issues there. You know, you can't do that immediately when you are so engulfed... (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:49:25
JANICE HARRIS LORD ...in your own pain yourself. But with a lot of time, Mrs. Walker shifted from being self-centered to being almost totally other-centered now. (crosstalk) 

00:49:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:49:40
JANICE HARRIS LORD I mean, if there's ever a wonderful example of the old phrase "making lemonade out of lemons," you know, she has done it, and we see that with so many families in, (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:49:50
JANICE HARRIS LORD in mothers against drunk driving, for example, you know. I, I remember working with people who came totally in shambles, but in time and with the right kind of support, they then became victim advocates and then became leaders in the movement and so forth. So, uh, it's, it's a wonderful thing when people are able to keep moving through the process until at some point they make that shift. 

00:50:10
HELPING YOURSELF BY HELPING OTHERS MEANINGFUL REENGAGEMENT 

00:50:10
LAURA YARBOROUGH  Uh, uhm, that was one of the things that we wanted to do as part of why I left nursing to start the bed and breakfast business. One of our goals was to create an environment that was restful, peaceful, a place where people could just get away, uhm, to just kind of regroup, think, uh, but a place that they felt safe, that they could talk about the child that they'd lost, that they could bring pictures if they wanted to 'coz we know, we like to look at pictures of our daughter and talk about them, but we knew a lot of other people who hadn't experienced that, who are uncomfortable with that. So we want people to be free to be able to do that, or to talk or not talk, whatever they wanted to do. And, uhm, we had a few in the first few years, now we've got it more and more couples coming. Not always couples, sometimes it's a single parents and a single parent come with their parent. 

00:51:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON I think this is, uh, speaks to their, uh, capacity to continue that, uh, connection that they have with the, uh, with their community. Uhm, and again, the important of, uh, uh, of being resilient to, uh, for others, and that they're able to provide something that they very badly needed, uh, I think any of us, would, uh, would need, during that early phase of adjusting to a violent death, a, a peaceful uh, place where you could, uh, could go for, uh, repose, uh, and the opportunity to, to, uh, quietly work through a lot of your own feelings and the rumination that goes on, uh, within weeks or months, uh, of a violent, uh, death. That they're now in a purposeful way able to provide this, uh, for others. That's wonderful. 

00:52:20
DR. CHARLES FIGLEY  And it's wonderful that they're able to do it as a couple, that they came to the conclusion that this was the right thing for them to do and that they reach out to others. I mean, I'm struck by the similarities, uh, uh, with Ms. Walker because she reaches out in a different way, with funerals and her ministry, but the same sort of thing, there is, there's some sense that, that there's a meaning in all of this, and I'm transforming this terrible thing into something positive to help other people, it's very beautiful. 

00:52:55
DR. TED RYNEARSON  In closing this program, I want to emphasize that there really is no ending or closure after the violent death of someone we have loved. Their violent dying changes us, the image of their killing is deeply imprinted like an unwanted stowaway that fades but cannot disappear. The two interviews have shown us that prevailing, rather than recovery, should be our goal. You can't recover who you were before, but with enough time, patience and sometimes clinical intervention, you can prevail over the dying and carry it forward within you to a hopeful living. Horace Kallen, a philosopher, once wrote a terse epigram that echoes my idea of prevailing over bereavement after violent dying. There are persons who shape their lives by fear of death, and persons who shape their lives by joy of life. The former live dying and the latter die living. Thanks for watching.

00:54:05
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Uh, Ms. Mary Walker has been kind enough to, to come in to review, uh, her progress, uh, of the last, over 20 years. I was reviewing your chart this morning, Mary, and uh, this is 2005 and we had our first visit in 1982, over 20 years ago. Uhm, and I think that the, one of the support groups had referred you to me because of, uh, the, uh, the death of your son in 1976, which we'll get into. And I, well, then I, also, I think in 1980 another of your, uh, children had, uhm, had disappeared. 

00:56:05
MARY WALKER  Yes. 

00:56:10
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:56:10
MARY WALKER She was a Green River victim. 

00:56:10
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Uh, we, we didn't, we didn't know about, uhm, about that until 1980, what, 4 or '85? 

00:56:25
MARY WALKER '84. 

00:56:25
DR. TED RYNEARSON '84. 

00:56:25
MARY WALKER Hmm. 

00:56:25
DR. TED RYNEARSON And we were seeing one another during that, that two-year interval. 

00:56:30
MARY WALKER Uh hmm. 

00:56:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON And then in 1988, you lost, uh, another child, a third child. 

00:56:40
MARY WALKER Uh hmm. 

00:56:40
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uhm, and at that point, they arranged to have you come in at my office more intensively. Well, because uh, you're going through a very difficult time with stress, trauma. Uh, and then we saw one another individually for a year or two, and I've not seen you, I don't think, uh, since 1990, so, I wonder if 15 years is enough. 

00:57:10
MARY WALKER  Hmm, yes, it has been about 15 years, but I have through Seattle public schools, uh, so, uh, and then this psychotherapy service as well. 

00:57:25
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

00:57:25
MARY WALKER  Just, uhm, when things seem to get a little heavy. 

00:57:35
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh-huh. 

00:57:35
MARY WALKER Ah(ph). 

00:57:35
DR. TED RYNEARSON Mary is, Mary has a degree, you have a master's degree in education, you're working on a. (crosstalk) 

00:57:40
MARY WALKER On special education. 

00:57:45
DR. TED RYNEARSON Special education. And Mary told me that, now at age 67, she's just finally retired last, uh, last year, and I was recalling, uhm, that you had a life of, lifetime, maybe several lifetimes of taking care of everybody around you. If we will go back, as I was reading through your past history in terms of your childhood as being the eldest of 13 kids? 

00:58:15
MARY WALKER Yes. The eldest of 13, and of those, 12 of us are still living. And, uh, my closest sister passed away in, uhm, what year was that? Uh, 1998. She, uhm, had a lifetime of, uh, lupus. 

00:58:40
DR. TED RYNEARSON Oh. 

00:58:40
MARY WALKER And, uhm, she uh, she passed, my mother passed away on January 2nd of this year, and, uhm, my husband passed away in March of 2000, uh, 2001. 

00:59:00
DR. TED RYNEARSON Hmm. 

00:59:00
MARY WALKER  So, basically, it's, I guess, it's been a learning process for me all the way. 

00:59:15
DR. TED RYNEARSON Those deaths were from natural cause? 

00:59:15
MARY WALKER  Natural causes. 

00:59:20
DR. TED RYNEARSON Sure. 

00:59:20
MARY WALKER But uh. 

00:59:20
DR. TED RYNEARSO  Different, I think, than what you went through with your children, presumably? 

00:59:25
MARY WALKER Very different and what I found with each death that, of, of someone who is close to me that each person has a special place and it is a different grief for each person. Uh, that, uhm, it's a relearning each time, it's, uh, not something you'd ever, ever get used to. It's like the first time incide, incident every time. So, it's not something. (crosstalk) 

01:00:05
DR. TED RYNEARSON Something which is as different as the relationship. 

01:00:10
MARY WALKER Is as different as the relationship, and as close as a relationship. 

01:00:15
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Can you, uh, in retrospect, can you remember what you went through uh, during those early years, uh, and how that's changed the time and the help? 

01:00:35
MARY WALKER Well, with my first son who was, uh, murdered in September of 1976, I, I believe what happened at that particular time, I went into what they call shock and somehow was able to function. But while at the same time what was happening was my whole world was falling apart around me and I didn't know what was happening. Ah, my children began to, uh, become unruly, uh, discipilined, uh, undisciplined and eventually, uh, my marriage, uh, fell apart. That was, ah, the, ah, at the least, this is when I wind up with the uh, new, oh, oh, my husband, and my first husband and I wind up, ah, divorcing. And as I reflect back on that period of time when this first violent crime hit our family was that it was too big for all of us, uh, because I didn't know anything about grief at that particular time. So what I did was sort of like shut it out, started a new career, and just start to put myself into the work not wanting to deal with it. The children started to go, ah, ah, do other things. My husband, he had his anger and he was going that way and this way, so all of us was dealing with this grief in some level, and it was just too big for any of us. And, you know, as I reflect back on it, it was just too, too large. And I notice now that if I see my ex-husband and my son, my only living son, Mark, Mark went through psychotherapy in that program too with you, ah, if the three, if we tend to get together, you can almost feel the, the hovering of the, the pain will come back together. And so eventually in this whole thing, a whole family seemed to have been destroyed. Uhm, I'm still, you know, I will say at that particular time I still was in this, this, this flat state, this kind of, ah, what in the grief circles they call a shock, how you can maintain life, you can pay your bills, you can go to work, and, uhm, ah, and everything is going on that, ah, you continue to maintain life at some survival level. And, ah, in my spiritual life, I learned, I've, I came up with the definition of shock and, ah, it's God's way of preserving us so that life can go on. Ah, and shock, to me, is not something that is initial. It's, ah, it can, you can, it's brought on by the initial trauma but, it is something that helps you to maintain your cognitive even though your emotional might be gone astray. 

01:04:45
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:04:45
MARY WALKER  And that's when I began to, ah, see where it helped me, for me. Until I came to you, I think for, like, 12 or 13 years, I had been in shock and I didn't, didn't realize how unbelievable violent crime can be to anybody. And I think that all of the, the, the, the rest of the things came from that first problem: the divorces, the separation, the running away, the, all of this is that somehow, I just realized that my life had suddenly changed and I didn't know who I was. And recognizing that my children, they didn't know who they were, nobody knew anything. We just knew that we had to pay the bills, and go to work, and all of these things and said, "Keep this life going." But in my reflection, as I went through with this, getting to know myself a little bit more, it is a life but it's not the same life. It's not, and, and people would come to me and say, "Well, you know, it's time for you to get on with your life," and I would become angry with these people and kept wondering, "Why are they telling me to get on with my life? I don't like this life, I don't want this life. I don't want this." And, ah. 

01:06:45
DR. TED RYNEARSON  You wanted things back the way they were. 

01:06:50
MARY WALKER I wanted, yeah, I didn't want this... (crosstalk) 

01:06:55
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh-huh(ph). 

01:06:55
MARY WALKER ...and so in psychotherapy, what I realized was, as I was talking to you was, it wasn't like getting on with my life, life as I knew it, but, ah, I, getting to know myself as I was now because it is a new life. I am no longer the same person. Starting a new life with a new person, someone who loved me, and loved my children, and loved my family, uhm, made life easier for me. The other thing that was helpful to me was the fact that I was in a profession, teaching, that was very, very nurturing and encouraging. I had good principals, I had good friends, and we're still good friends, and uh, they were able to encourage me and keep me going. But... (crosstalk) 

01:08:10
DR. TED RYNEARSON What is your, what, what is your belief about death? 

01:08:10
MARY WALKER About death? I think that death is like any other sleep. I think death, you know, that death is a. 

01:08:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON Is some spiritual belief? 

01:08:30
MARY WALKER  I have a spiritual belief about death in that, uhm, one of the things that, uhm, in, you know, when we go to sleep at night, I mean, ah, whenever you go to sleep, we don't, you don't really know what's going on, you know. You may have dreams or you may have something but once you really go to sleep, you are asleep. 

01:09:10
DR. TED RYNEARSON What about your three children and the, ah, the other who have died? You think that they still exist in some level? 

01:09:15
MARY WALKER  I think they are asleep. 

01:09:20
DR. TED RYNEARSON Okay. 

01:09:20
MARY WALKER  Ah, because in my belief system is that there is a second coming of Christ to receive us. I, I don't believe in the fact that you die and go to heaven. I don't, I don't believe that, and that's one of the differences in the religions that we have. Uhm, I believe that we go to sleep. We are, we are entering to a rest. We go in rest until the time comes when we go to meet with the Lord; that we are, ah, asleep, ah, resting somewhere and what, ah, that one of these days that life will be eternal. There is eternal life, and how that eternal life exist after we, ah, with the Lord, I, you know, someone said it's beautiful. 

01:10:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Let me interrupt 'coz I wanted to, there's something else that I wanted to focus on. We'll get back to that. I wanted to focus on the therapy because at the EDA, uhm, you came in and joined the group, ah, and we worked more specifically on supporting you and encouraging you to express the feelings, and I remember one of the things that you felt was helpful at that point was that you finally allowed yourself to get angry. 

01:10:55
MARY WALKER Uh-huh. 

01:10:55
DR. TED RYNEARSON  It was something that you haven't recognized in yourself. 

01:11:00
MARY WALKER  The thing was that after all of these things that happened, I guess my greatest grief was there must have been a reason. And, and, and I think it comes from religious teaching from years back that when bad things happen to you, the, there must've been a bad cause to cause all of this to happen. And part of psychotherapy did this, was to bring me to the point of seeing that what happened to me was external. It happened out there rather than in here. And it wasn't until after Linda got killed, when we were in, ah, I was in this, ah, that I realized that I met a pastor and a mentor that brought it all together for me one day and he finally, I mean I said, "My God, after all of this psychotherapy and all of these years and years of this, finally it hits point." He says, "Something, someone did something to you," and I looked like and I said, "What?" I, for some reason, I could never in my mind's eye recognize that some bad person could do something to this good person. And I think this is where the anger came, when I could be angry. 

01:12:50
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:12:50
MARY WALKER  That I kept on saying that I was the bad person, I was the cause of all of this thing happening, and I couldn't understand this. And I kept saying was, "I'm not a good, I'm not a bad mother. I'm not the best mother, some people are worse than me" and I'm trying to get this entire thing together in my mind, but I was, it was really internalizing it and never externalizing it. 

01:13:25
DR. TED RYNEARSON Let me interrupt again, 'coz there's something, something that I thought was important that we cover, ah, 'coz these, these deaths of your, ah, your children are pretty remote events, ah, in terms of years, am I right? 

01:13:40
MARY WALKER Uh hmm. 

01:13:40
DR. TED RYNEARSON I'm sure it's still very close to you, I mean, what we've been talking about. But what about your memories of those, ah, those three kids? Is that, uhm, how often do you think of them? 

01:13:55
MARY WALKER Well, I have, I should've brought the pictures. I have pictures of them prominently in my living room, large pictures, and I think, I think of them often. 

01:14:10
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:14:10
MARY WALKER  I don't visit the graveyard, though. I don't, I don't, I, uhm, every once in a while I think that, you know, like maybe every five years or so I might think of the graveyard, but I, I don't. 

01:14:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON What sort of memories do you have of them? 

01:14:30
MARY WALKER  Warren, the oldest one, I, my memories of him has evolved into he's like to me a guardian angel. He was a gentle giant, big, tall guy, and, ah, kind of looked after me. (crosstalk) 

01:14:55
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:14:55
MARY WALKER And one of the things about him is when I, he, it's like he comes to my memory usually in a dream or in a thought when I'm trying to figure out things, ah, and he'll show up. 

01:15:20
DR. TED RYNEARSON So, he's a, he's a comfortive? 

01:15:20
MARY WALKER He's a comfortive. Terry, I think of her mostly because of Marcel(ph). Usually when, when he is sane(ph), he, he, he very seldom has any low times, but I see so much of her in him... (crosstalk) 

01:15:45
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:15:45
MARY WALKER ...until she's present all the time. And she was happy, she was a happy, ah, she was kind of like always happy, until the last years or so. And, uhm, I think of her because he loves the music, she played music even though he is, ah, menta, uh, he is uh, mentally delayed. He is, he is, he is a wonderful, wonderful person, and, ah, there is so much of her in him until you just can't get her out of mind. 

01:16:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON So these are comforting sort of image, image of her(ph). (crosstalk) 

01:16:30
MARY WALKER These is a, (inaudible ) images of her. You know, he graduated from high school even. (crosstalk) 

01:16:40
DR. TED RYNEARSON What about, what about your other daughter Mary? 

01:16:40
MARY WALKER My other daughter, that is Andre's. With her, I will say sometimes I still get mad with her. I, uhm, I see what has happened to her children. She left two children and these kids are still not connected. It bothered me the way they died but I have, you know, I've had visions of, you know, sweet visions of them in heaven, somewhere, and not that I believe that, you know, it's kinda, this whole thing about death, getting back to death, about this restful sleep, and this being with the Lord, uhm, you, it's, it's almost so it's like a, a, a, it's such a reality that you can almost put it into reality that even though you said, some might have said, "Well, this hasn't happened yet" but it is so real that it has happened. And, so, one of the things was, uhm, as I began to deal with my own spirituality, and, uhm, I was, uhm, I, I like to drive, you know, when I, ah, every once in a while I like to go out driving, and thinking, just myself, and I was on my way to the church one Sunday morning and, ah, we were playing spiritual music and singing and having a good time and all of a sudden the girls kind of showed up in this, everything was going on and I just said to the kids, "Hey, guess what, your parents and your moms, says they're all looking at you and they're, and is, ah, they're singing with us, and they're having a good time up there. And it was just this beautiful vision. 

01:19:10
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:19:10
MARY WALKER With Linda, I, uhm, my oldest daughter, this is the one that really sent me into catatonia, or somewhere; I don't know where I was, and I was so concerned about her because it was just almost like she and I just didn't connect. I mean it was like, and, and, ah, and we'd just for, I begged her, I said, "Please don't move back to Seattle, don't go near that man, don't go back," and she said, "Well, I'm just gonna go where he's not goin' to bother me." So she goes and get this apartment. I helped her get furniture and renew everything for her. She goes to sign the lease and that's the day she gets killed, and I'm sitting up here like, "Oh, my God. Not a third time! Not a third time!" So I spoke to the guy upstairs and I said, "Listen, this isn't making you looking good, look good. This is enough. I can't take this." But anyway. 

01:20:25
DR. TED RYNEARSON Three strikes, you're out. 

01:20:25
MARY WALKER Three stikes, no. He was out. I was, really, I had to, I had a word with the man upstairs. And finally, I began to worry about her salvation. I said, "I cannot believe this. Why would somebody do this?" And I began to worry about salvation, and I began to talk to God. I said, "God, I need to know, I need to know this. You got to tell me. You have to tell me that she's all right. I want to know," just like that. I said, "You gotta tell me this," and I mean I'm, I'm here, I was going through this whole thing just talking it, talking to God, and arguing with Him, and beating Him up, and, you know, that Jacob thing. I said, "I need to know about my daughter. Now, you need to tell me." So by this time, I was beginning to say, "God, you are losing it." That, I think that's when you told me it was time for me to come in. I said, "God, you are losing it." So finally, I get this call from a friend of mine, a woman who had, could have been my mentor, ah, friend, ah, an older woman who would, kinda looked out to me while I'm, when I was younger with young children; used to baby sit my kids and help me out and stuff, and she said, "Mary, I got something to tell you," and I said, "What?" She said, "I was talking to this man who was at church when Linda had the accident." And I said, "You were?" She said, "He was with her when she died," I said, "He was?" And she said, "He began to talk to me about being with this girl and everything," and she said in describing him and she says, "Well, I know her." She said, "I was with her when she was born. I've known all her life," and everything. "I know her," and then the guy told her and said, "Well, do you know her mother?" and she said, "Yes, I know her." He said, "Well, tell her it's all right." 

01:22:55
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Uh hmm. 

01:23:00
MARY WALKER And that's how my spirituality is. "Tell her it's all right," and I said, "What do you mean "it's all right?" "Well, tell her that her daughter is all right, that as she was ah, in her last breathe, she was talking to God and she was saying, "Dear Lord, please take care of my children. Just take care of my children." And there is something in the Bible that says, "They that call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." I believe what the Bible says, and I believe I had an answer to my prayer. 

01:23:55
DR. TED RYNEARSON And your daughter did too, in those last moments? 

01:23:55
MARY WALKER In those last moment. 

01:23:55
DR. TED RYNEARSON  But it sounds to me as if ah, in terms of your ministry, ah, that this has become very, very meaningful kind of like activity for you now in terms of connecting others with something that you found, ah, you saw a personally meaningful, restorative. What is, what does your ministry consist of, what do you. (crosstalk) 

01:24:20
MARY WALKER  My ministry, basically, is I do lot of funerals, pastoral care. 

01:24:35
DR. TED RYNEARSON So you're sort of focused on, uhm, this whole time of bereavement? 

01:24:40
MARY WALKER Bereavement, uhm, to let, uh, just to be, to walk with people through it and to let them know that they can live, that there is a life. I guess my message is to people, whether that, I don't care what your religion is. Ah, I, I have become involved in, uh, interfaith groups, ecumenical groups, uhm, I've worked with many, many different people and the story of Jesus is a, is and, is a historical event. I mean, something happened, and to me, His life has taught us how to get through difficult times. 

01:25:50
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:25:50
MARY WALKER It, and one of the things is I decided to look at this His life in terms of his mother. It was not until I decided to go to the Cross with Mary and stand there as a mother in that very difficult time. Getting to know that my name, I thought that I had a beautiful name, Mary. I thought it was a pretty name and found out that the word meant bitterness, it means hurt. And through it all, I learned that grief, it, when you go through this life, that life is what happens while we're making other plans, and that's one of my favorite, favorite philosopher, John Lennon. 

01:27:00
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:27:00
MARY WALKER He wrote a song called, uh, "Beautiful Boy" and life is what happens. It happens. And Jesus said in, He said that we are going to have these difficult times but be of good cheer, He has overcome the world. Now, I don't know what joy is and I don't what cheer is, but it is the comfort and hope that there is life, and there is life eternal. So I say to people who are experiencing something like this, choose life and choose it everyday. Everyday look for the good. There is some goodness. I've, I have, I've wondered why I have gone through this. I would worship, uh, worship upon anyone else. But if you study that life of Jesus where so much is taken from you, somehow there's a reason in it. 

01:28:35
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Mary, thank you so much. I think that's a good message to, to leave us with. 

01:28:40
DR. TED RYNEARSON  I had known the Yarboroughs since 1991, uh, when their daughter Sarah(ph), uh, was killed; December of 1991 and, uh, this was July of 2005 so our, uh, relationship goes back a number of years. Uhm, and I've asked them to come in, uhm, to talk about the longer term sort of, uh, challenge, uhm, in terms of their accommodating to the, to Sarah's(ph) death; both what ah, what they were going through initially that, uh, that, uh, led them to asking for some help, and then, uhm, what's helped ah, since that time because I know you, uh, you haven't been in any sort of formal sort of, uh, psychotherapy since this. So this type, this, this tape is being made to, to highlight sort of the natural resources of, of resilience of stability for family members out there, ah, while on that; not to just to focus on, on what's been problematic but, uh, or something else. The two of you sort of balance yourselves and your kids, and the remaining kids are(ph) going through this. Uhm, so maybe I can just talk both of you, uhm, uh, talk for a moment about what you went through initially and, uh, uh, how this has changed you overtime. 

01:30:15
TOM YARBOROUGH  Okay. 

01:30:20
LAURA YARBOROUGH Uhm, I think as Tom has mentioned to you a little bit before, it's hard to remember some of those initial days, and you remember certain events but, and a lot of those, the first couple of years are kind of hazy. Uh, you asked about what initially, uhm, brought us to seek help. I think for me, I know I was having difficulty concentrating at work, and function, functioning there and also having difficulty maintaining the, the boys' schedule when they were still very busy in athletics, and all the things that kids are involved in at school and all the schedules, and keeping everything straight was a little overwhelming. And that and the reactions of other people, their reactions to us, and you are always, other people are uncomfortable around you because they don't know how to respond. They don't know what to say, they're afraid to say the wrong thing and sometimes people just say really crazy things that are hurtful. 

01:31:35
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:31:35
LAURA YARBOROUGH Just dealing with some of those things, I think we needed, I needed help with how to get the family back. It's some sort of progress going forward, I guess, that's why I needed help with. 

01:31:50
DR. TED RYNEARSON  So you're focused on the family? 

01:31:55
LAURA YARBOROUGH I think that was my biggest focus. 

01:31:55
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:31:55
LAURA YARBOROUGH  More even so than my job, I'm gonna, my job was important but my kids were more important to me. 

01:32:05
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. How about you, Tom? 

01:32:10
LAURA YARBOROUGH Yeah. 

01:32:10
TOM YARBOROUGH I remember as I told you earlier this morning, (crosstalk) 

01:32:10
 Yeah. 

01:32:10
TOM YARBOROUGH a whole lot about interval uhm, you know, from about December of 1991 until around '95. You know we were, we remained active with many things with, uh, particularly with the boys and the things they were doing... (crosstalk) 

01:32:30
 Uh hmm. 

01:32:30
TOM YARBOROUGH ...in school with sports and all kinds of things like that and of course, my job went on and, uh, that was a challenge as Laura mentioned just to kind of keep your balance and, uh, professionalism and, uh, and, and it was hard to, uhm, keep that, uhm, interest in its, you sometimes wonder what, if you are really studying(ph) short changing your employer because you really struggle or at least, I struggle to care as much as I used to and, uh, there's a lot of things in this work(ph) that interesting to me for a while, and some of it came back. I'm an engineer and I work in a, energy management and that kind of thing and uh, it was just, just sort of uhm, push the buttons and, uh, go through the motions and try to do the best you can. So, when you're, it's there, so, it was, uh, helpful uhm, to be involved with, uhm, the program that initially brought us into contact with you and uhm, I don't know how well I was doing through all this but I seem to be, I was, I, I remember being more concerned about Laura and about our older son. He seemed to have the most difficulty, uh, adjusting if you ever do and coming to some sort of equilibrium, anyway, with, uh, the loss of his sister. And so we were interested in anything that could be, that could lay your hands off, uh, assist in trying to help him and ourselves heal up and, uh, of course we were concerned when, we knew, uh, Laura has a pretty good background in, uh, both in the medicine and, uh, to some extent, psychology and psychiatry. Well, you know, what we did, at least you've had exposure and she knew. 

01:35:00
DR. TED RYNEARSON As a nurse? 

01:35:00
TOM As a nurse, she knew some of the problems that families went through, and some of the statistics were, kinds of that thing to consider, and we were concern about that. 

01:35:10
DR. TED RYNEARSON But at times as if, one of the major sources of, of support was within the family and, and taking care of one another, ah, within the family. 

01:35:20
LAURA YARBOROUGH  Yeah, we had a, I think we had a strong family to begin with. 

01:35:25
DR. TED RYNEARSON Yeah. 

01:35:25
LAURA YARBOROUGH And, uhm, I think instead of pulling away from each other, we tend to pull together. And our, our church group was very, very supportive of us. And I'm not, I'm not sure whether we have made it without their support. They were there from the very beginning, you know, answer the door, answer the phone, dealt with the media. We never had to deal with any of the media until months afterwards. They took care of everything. 

01:36:05
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. What is your belief system? What's your belief about, uh, death? Uh, not that any of us knows. What do you, (crosstalk) 

01:36:15
LAURA YARBOROUGH (inaudible ) 

01:36:19
DR. TED RYNEARSON what do you think happens after death? What happened with Sarah in other words that's we're focusing on. 

01:36:20
TOM YARBOROUGH  My, my(ph) particular belief system, I know nothing. Orthodox Christians, so we, I, I suppose I look Laura in mine and our boys understanding of death is related to the, the evidence for the, the resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, so if they at least die, came alive again, we're not as most Christians would say. I'm not too certain about what the kind of, you know, intermediate state is for the departed, what exactly they're doing right now but we don't believe that she just ceased to exist when ah, physical life ended, so, I think we've always had that, uh, starting with that grounding in that knowledge that, uh, uh, historical evidence for, uh, continuation of life after death and we've just based, gone in the end. And, uh, haven't really, I guess, they, through it all, we've not been what I suppose, the meaning of Christians we haven't been too concerned about Sarah. Actually(ph), she, she's fine, but, uh, what about the rest of us... (crosstalk) 

01:37:50
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:37:50
TOM YARBOROUGH ...who gotta keep on struggling here. So, that's, in a nutshell, you want to add anything to that? 

01:38:00
LAURA YARBOROUGH I just remember saying one time, "I want Sarah back." And you, I remember you saying, "How cruel would that be to bring here back here? She's much happier where she is now. 

01:38:10
TOM YARBOROUGH  We think. 

01:38:15
LAURA YARBOROUGH I'm not. We believe she is with God and that will see her again in some days. (crosstalk) 

01:38:20
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh-huh. 

01:38:20
LAURA YARBOROUGH  I think, that hope sustains us. 

01:38:25
TED RYNEARSON Uh-huh. Now, what else has been, uh, helpful in terms of the community, and, uh, things outside in the family to keep you engaged? 

01:38:40
LAURA YARBOROUGH Well, at that particular time in the community that we lived in even though it's, uh, pretty large now, it was, uh, a smaller community and we were pretty connected, Tom coached little league and coached the boys and girls club and so we had a network of friends from that and neighbors and that sort of things. And so, we realized the support in that way too. I remember Tom was actually coaching boys and girls' club basketball at the time Sarah was killed and they, they sent a big box over to our house, the boy's and girl's club with paper plates and napkins and cups and even toilet paper and I've thought, "Why do we need this for? Where we can go and buy this." And then, I realized I can't even go to store. Uh, I was not functional enough at that time to go to the store and plus you have so many people in and out of the house. So, it was really very helpful. And, and then, I, Tom, they just assumed Tom would not want to coach and just call and said, "Don't worry about your team. We'll get another replacement." And he said, "No, I wanna coach. I want to do it." So, they got a co-coach for him and he continued to do that. 

01:40:00
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:40:00
LAURA YARBOROUGH I, I remember even the referees coming up to him and, uh, checking his hand and telling him how sorry they were, and, that sort of thing. So, we, we had a pretty good network of friends at church and our community. Uhm, and I think we started to get involved after a time with other people, although we were even at the beginning, people would come to us to talk about their experiences with people who had died or telling us that, they realized when Sarah died, they never dealt with the death of their father or mother, or whomever. 

01:40:45
DR. TED RYNEARSON And both of you become much more active with that, haven't you, in terms of speaking to the community and appearing in forum groups? 

01:40:50
LAURA YARBOROUGH I've probably done more actual public speaking than you have? 

01:40:55
TOM YARBOROUGH (inaudible ) 

01:41:00
LAURA YARBOROUGH Uhm, in, in a form, in a sense, uhm, and although I know people, a lot of people come to Tom individually. 

01:41:10
DR. TED RYNEARSON Several, several years ago when you began your bed and breakfast. 

01:41:15
LAURA YARBOROUGH Uh hmm. 

01:41:15
DR. TED RYNEARSON Because you did something I thought was very unique, uhm, in terms of sort of spreading the word to the support groups that you wanted to be of, of support to, to family members that had lost a child and these couples who had lost a child in terms of, (crosstalk) 

01:41:30
LAURA YARBOROUGH Uh hmm. 

01:41:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON coming to stay with you? 

01:41:30
LAURA YARBOROUGH  Uh hmm. That, uh, that was one of the things that we wanted to do as part of why I left nursing to start the bed and breakfast business. One of our goals was to create an environment that was restful, peaceful place where people could just get away, uhm, to just kind of regroup, think, but a place that they felt safe that they could talk about the child that they'd lost, that they could bring pictures if they wanted to 'cause we know we like to look at pictures of our daughter and talk about them, but we knew a lot of other people who hadn't experienced that, were uncomfortable with that, so I wanted people to be free to be able to do that, or to talk or not talk, whatever they wanted to do. And, uhm, we had a few in the first few years, now we've gotten more and more couples coming. Not always couples, sometimes it's a single parent, uhm, a single parent come with their parent. Uhm, we got a call the other night for a, they wanted the whole family to come out and stay. There just been a suicide in the home, but we were already full so we couldn't take them. We found, usually it works best if those couples, especially if they're really struggling or it's early, uh, if they come and they're our only guest whether their, uhm, we've had some people come when we've had other guests and if they're really having a hard time, it doesn't work very well. 

01:43:15
DR. TED RYNEARSON Yeah. 

01:43:15
LAURA YARBOROUGH  Although we've had other couples come who have been farther along in the process, and, uhm, in fact last weekend we had a couple, uh, who'd lost a son and they were, it had been over a year, I think, for them, and we'd had other guests at the time and we didn't talk to them a whole lot, but the man came up to me when he left, and just gave me a hug and just said, "Thank you so much" he said, "This has been so restful and, uh, we now do understand, and" yeah, we just talked about the club we belong to that no one wants to join. I don't get it. We had a couple that lost a, a baby and they came out, and, uh, they wrote us a really nice note and said that they felt like that, their stay with us was a turning point for them in being able to go on. So that's a first. And. 

01:44:20
DR. TED RYNEARSON So it's being able to provide a place of, of, provide some stability and some comfort? 

01:44:25
LAURA YARBOROUGH Uh hmm. 

01:44:25
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Because you're, uh, so emphatic with their, but you're glad you haven't gone through it yourself then. 

01:44:35
LAURA YARBOROUGH We had one couple that came out that really keep, the, the husband was having the hardest time, he really wanted to talk to Tom, uhm, because he felt like other men were uncomfortable with his emotions, and. 

01:44:50
TOM YARBOROUGH He's still in the stage where, you just, I mean, start crying and painfully which I recall being like that, and, and I didn't have the problems at my workplace like that, I can remember one of our, talking to one of our senior vice presidents, who actually just came to ask me how I was doing, and he's totally, I said at the time I have been the dumper and was not doing to well, he just came, tried to offer any, but he is nodding, sentimental, he was trying to be as supportive as possible, but he didn't act like he was embarrassed or anything. I mean, apparently this gentleman, you know, visiting with us was not finding much, uh, empathy issues life in his, in his workplace. We had a nice talk. 

01:45:40
LAURA YARBOROUGH He had a real point to (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

01:45:44
TOM YARBOROUGH Yeah, he was married, married, married, clear in some other things he was wondering about, and we had a chance to, I, I guess that I was reassuring to him that, well, I remember a lot of things like that, and I go on through anything that fortunately, a very ordinary, I couldn't really give him much comfort, that it was going to disappear. I, how much I basically tell him only a little, but I just sort of has a, grief, grief sort of has a mind of its own, and it won't come and go as it pleases. 

01:46:20
DR. TED RYNEARSON So, it doesn't disappear altogether? 

01:46:25
TOM YARBOROUGH No, it never does. 

01:46:25
DR. TED RYNEARSON But, uh, are there days that go by when the two of you don't have thoughts about Sarah? Well. 

01:46:30
TOM YARBOROUGH  For me, yeah, I realized that I go long periods of time, and, without thinking about her, and for a while I went through a period where I'd recall, when I didn't think about her, I almost felt guilty. And now I don't, I just think, "Well, that's normal." One thing that happens is life and death goes on, and, uhm, uhm, the curious thing to me is all of, and I've, that's one reason, I, I think one thing that worries me right now is, is just the thought of losing my wife because my grandmothers and my, uhm, all of the women that had really been dear to me, have, have, are deceased now, and, uh, but that in a way, with those kinds of things happening, it's sort of, I don't know, just makes the, the loss of Sarah so, it fits more into just, you're, you're not experiencing something that's, uhm, the violent aspect of it, in fact her life was taken from her, uh, and that, it's always, uh, gonna be, it's, I guess, that we're already at edge there, but the... (crosstalk) 

01:47:45
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:47:45
TOM YARBOROUGH ...fact that she's gone, uhm, I think they're just, you come to the acceptance of that, and it just breaks my heart, it's a part of life is, is death. 

01:47:55
DR. TED RYNEARSON Okay. 

01:47:55
TOM YARBOROUGH  And dealing with it. 

01:48:00
DR. TED RYNEARSON What about for you, Laura? 

01:48:00
LAURA YARBOROUGH  Uhm, in what sense? I'm sorry, I lost track of the question. 

01:48:05
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Well, I'm starting to focus on, on Sarah, and whether you're processing... (crosstalk) 

01:48:10
LAURA YARBOROUGH Uh hmm. 

01:48:10
DR. TED RYNEARSON ...your memory of Sarah now, is it, uh, Tom says that it's something that, uh, isn't with him everyday. 

01:48:20
LAURA YARBOROUGH It's, it's not with me everyday, but it will come unexpectedly almost that I don't anticipate. We have a, a lady who's helping me at the bed and breakfast now who has young children, she's a two-year-old that she has to bring to work with her, 'cause she doesn't have day care, and she's kind of adopted me as her grandmother, 'cause she doesn't have a grandmother. I'm holding her in my lap sometimes, and she's going to sleep in my arms, and I just have that poignant feeling of remembering Sarah at that age, and having a daughter, and combing her hair, and those sorts of things that bring brack(ph) big(ph), bring back really poignant memories, (crosstalk) 

01:49:05
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:49:05
LAURA YARBOROUGH yeah, since she was our only daughter. So in that sense (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

01:49:14
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Those, those are memories you would, you would treasure. 

01:49:15
LAURA YARBOROUGH Uh hmm. 

01:49:15
DR. TED RYNEARSON What about the traumatic memories of the way that, uh, that she died, the flashbacks of her dying? Either one of you go through that anymore? 

01:49:25
LAURA YARBOROUGH I do, still, sometimes. Sometimes people will ask me about her or ask me details about, "Well, how did your daughter die?" And that's always painful and it's hard because it's upsetting to them and you don't know how much to say or not say or how to say it in a way that's, are not that's, that's tearful. I have a picture of her in my office and then there was a guest that walked into the office, asked who that is and I say that's my daughter. And inevitably, not always, sometimes they'll start asking more questions. And I've almost thought about taking the picture down but I can't quite bring myself to do that, so it's, yeah, that didn't, and I, I don't watch the news at all anymore on television. (crosstalk) 

01:50:20
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:50:20
LAURA YARBOROUGH  I just found something that death's something that, it's just too hard for me. It's just too overwhelming. 

01:50:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON Well, I know. Local news are full of de, violent death, I know. 

01:50:30
LAURA YARBOROUGH  Uh hmm. Uh hmm. I just, I just don't watch it at all. 

01:50:35
DR. TED RYNEARSON And dreams, are the two of you still dreaming about Sarah? 

01:50:40
LAURA YARBOROUGH Once in a great while but not like I used to. Not. I used to relive her death in my dreams and we dream that I was, she was calling out to me and I couldn't get to her and that sort of thing and I, I barely have that or if I do I don't remember it. 

01:51:05
DR. TED RYNEARSON Hmm. 

01:51:05
LAURA YARBOROUGH Although I still have that kind of experience when I'm not dreaming sometimes, I don't know, I'm just almost wondering about her last moments. 

01:51:15
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:51:15
LAURA YARBOROUGH And that's always really painful. 

01:51:15
DR. TED RYNEARSON Hmm. How about you, Tom? 

01:51:20
TOM YARBOROUGH  I've never thought about that that much, you see, Ted it just doesn't. I don't, I don't think I'm avoiding it, I mean, thinking about it right now I, it's not that painful to me. You know, I have pain about, it's like, you know, I'm sure, you pretty much, you need to ask with people just, pain just comes at the hardest times and just, I was looking at a, of a photo collage that Laura has on the wall and, uh, our family put it the other day and was looking at some things and there was several things of Sarah in there. The sharpest pain into that point, uh, just thinking about the, the loss of, uh, all the things that, uh, other people experienced with their children and, (crosstalk) 

01:52:20
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:52:20
TOM YARBOROUGH and we never got to, uh, experience with that, used to going to weddings was painful and, uh, father would bring the bride down. And we went to one the other day and I don't think about it. I don't even think, I know I even thought about Sarah during the whole process. I mean, I was happy for the, uh, close friends, and... (crosstalk) 

01:52:45
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:52:45
TOM YARBOROUGH ...a girl who live next door to us. It was kinda like a surrogate daughter or something to us one of our children almost. I was just real happy and think about it. But occasionally that, that does happen that kind of thing. 

01:53:00
LAURA YARBOROUGH And I remember when our boys, when our boys got married that was one thing that all of us felt as a family, was her absence. 

01:53:10
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:53:10
LAURA YARBOROUGH That she should've been there. 

01:53:10
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:53:10
LAURA YARBOROUGH  And our boys have spoken out real strongly lately even that, uh, they feel like they missed her, in each, uh, children she might have had... (crosstalk) 

01:53:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:53:30
LAURA YARBOROUGH ...that there'll never meet that nephew or niece or, (crosstalk) 

01:53:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:53:30
LAURA YARBOROUGH  that she has never met their wives. They, they feel angry about it. 

01:53:40
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh hmm. 

01:53:40
TOM YARBOROUGH As I've gotten older and I have a brother and a sister and I've, I've come to appreciate that we're just close organic connection that my brother and I and my sister and I have. How, even though we've been separated by many, you know, long distances from quite a few years is just, uhm, they're just like a part of me and I realize that that's the way the boys are and that's the way they were with Sarah, and it's helped me appreciate that, uh, even though in some ways I thought Laura who has suffered the most loss and losing a, some, a child and particularly a daughter and she had something, she'd always wanted to have was a daughter. Uhm, the, the boys in many ways, uh, are still learning what that separation from Sarah is and how that is affecting, I mean, it just goes on with them. And that they deal with it. I mean, it's not like they're struggling with it but I just realized that it's, affects them a lot more than (inaudible ) and even the parents are affected. 

01:55:00
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uhm, as you point out there's something generational about it. 

01:55:00
TOM YARBOROUGH Yeah. 

01:55:00
DR. TED RYNEARSON Uh, not only your, your nuclear family but your, your, your own part of your family, in terms of your own brothers and sisters but as I recall Sarah, the, the older, oldest of the three children, (crosstalk) 

01:55:15
TOM YARBOROUGH Yeah. 

01:55:15
DR. TED RYNEARSON she, she, uh, she got a pretty positive nurturing sort of role within the family, hadn't she? 

01:55:20
TOM YARBOROUGH  Yeah. 

01:55:25
LAURA YARBOROUGH Yeah. She was, uh, she was the, the peacemaker... (crosstalk) 

01:55:30
DR. TED RYNEARSON Hmm. 

01:55:30
LAURA YARBOROUGH ...of the boys. And, uhm, she was the gentle one so. 

01:55:35
TOM YARBOROUGH She was the best person in our family. I think all of us would tell you that character, just her general demeanor. The way she dealt with people for whatever reason that's just the way she turned out. 

01:55:50
DR. TED RYNEARSON Oh, the two of you must have got something to do with it. 

01:55:50
TOM YARBOROUGH Oh, yeah. 

01:55:50
LAURA YARBOROUGH  I'm not sure of that thing. 

01:55:55
TOM YARBOROUGH Yeah, I don't know about that. 

01:55:55
LAURA YARBOROUGH She, she was the type that would seek out a person that was disenfranchised or hurting or whatever at school. I mean, a lot of that we learned after her death... (crosstalk) 

01:56:05
DR. TED RYNEARSON Oh. 

01:56:05
LAURA YARBOROUGH ...because people either wrote us letters or came to visit us that she had some sort of impact on their life that we didn't even know about. 

01:56:15
DR. TED RYNEARSON  Uh hmm. Well, Laura and Tom I can't thank you enough for coming in. Is there anything that you would wanna add to, to the tape that we haven't covered? Something that, uh, something or someone that's really been helpful as you were going through this? 

01:56:40
LAURA YARBOROUGH Well, you've really been helpful. 

01:56:40
TOM YARBOROUGH Uh-huh. Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:56:40
LAURA YARBOROUGH And your program has been helpful to us and we sent a lot of people, we give a lot of people your name especially when they come and, because people know. We don't talk about the Bed and Breakfast except by word of mouth. And, uh, so sometimes people will call and, and where, from what they tell us we know the person is not ready to come and stay with us. They're just too traumatized still. And, uhm, so a lot of times, we'll give them, well, separation and loss number and recommend they call you and, and maybe some time they will really, will be ready to come. So, that seemed helpful. 

01:57:25
DR. TED RYNEARSON Yeah. Well, thank you. 

01:57:30
