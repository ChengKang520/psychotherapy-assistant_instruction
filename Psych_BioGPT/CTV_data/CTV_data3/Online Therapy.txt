Hello, 

00:00:00
I'm wondering if I could arrange a few appointments with you. 

00:00:00
That would be fine. How would you like to meet - Messaging, Skype, Email? 

00:00:00
? 

00:00:00
it's all about my girlfriend really, we'd been going out together for about three years when she suddenly decided that she wanted to retrain as an accountant. I was 

00:00:00
OK with that at first but then she said she'd need to move to Leicester because that's where the course is and I hadn't really realized that - I mean it'd mean not seeing

with Jacqui Atkinson 

00:00:00
her except at the weekend and I play football on Saturdays so we wouldn't see that much of each other at all unless I gave up the football and really I think that's what she wants and I 

00:00:00
really do enjoy my football and don't really want to give it up but, then again, I don't want to lose her either so it's really diffic so I'm wondering what you think I should do 

00:00:00
a programme from counseling DVDs in association with University of Wales, Newport Prifysgol Cymru, Casnewydd 

00:00:50
MIKE SIMMONS Hello. My name's Mike Simmons. It's obviously a reflection of my age, but when I started training as a counselor, there were no mobile phones and there was no email. Communication was face-to-face, by telephone, by letter, and that was pretty much it. Modern technologies have changed all that, of course, and it sometimes seems as if people are communicating with each other pretty much all the time. By Skype, by Facebook, by email, by text, by blog, by mobile phone, the list goes on and on. It's no surprise then that there is a groundswell of potential clients who expect to receive counseling support by these technologies too, nor that there are a growing number of counselors who feel that this is something they should or could be able to offer to their clients. That's what this DVD is all about. It's aimed very squarely at trained counselors who are asking themselves whether they might venture into doing something more than straightforward, face-to-face work. 

00:01:55
MIKE SIMMONS I'm joined in the studio today by Jacqui Atkinson, who has already asked herself this question and found the answer and has become very experienced in online work. As well as being a fully trained counselor and supervisor, she is a founder member of ATCO, the Association for Counselors and Therapists Online, and is the coordinator for OCTIA, Online Counseling and Therapy in Action. That's a branch of ATCO that holds an annual conference about online counseling work which, while it takes place in a conventional conference room, is also webstreamed throughout the world. Pretty interesting stuff. 

00:02:40
MIKE SIMMONS So, Jacqui, what are the key differences between counseling that takes place by means of these technologies and face-to-face work? 

00:02:45
JACQUI ATKINSON It's a very convenient way of working because there is much more control over time, both the counselor and client. Um, either can work at any time of the day or night, they can respond uh, when it is convenient for them, there is a greater privacy in lots of ways, working like this, and clients don't even have to have to be seen by a counselor if they don't wish to be because they can hide behind the technology. Um, there is often also a lot more time to be able to think about what you're going to say and how you're going to respond as a counselor, and as a client, a lot more time to construct what you really do want to say. 

00:03:30
MIKE SIMMONS So there's some real advantages in doing this. 

00:03:30
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, this can be extremely useful for people who are say, on shift-work, people who live abroad, uh, for carers who find it incredibly difficult to leave the home, for those with disabilities, uh, particularly those with hearing disabilities because they do not have to enter into a dialogue to work in this way. 

00:03:55
MIKE SIMMONS So, it sounds like actually technologies are making counseling available to people to whom it might not otherwise be available. 

00:04:05
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, or it would be very difficult for them to access it. It makes it more readily available uh, both when they're in their hometown and if they happen to be away, if they're abroad. People don't have to work for a solid hour. They can break it up if they wish which is very useful for those who may be recovering from illnesses such as cancer. 

00:04:30
MIKE SIMMONS Right, so there's a lot of things going on here. The, the client doesn't have to fit in so readily or so exactly with what the counselor might normally offer. Normally a counselor is saying, "I can give you an hour, it would be at this time in this place." But suddenly the client doesn't have to fit in with that. They can work in a way which works for them. The other side of that coin is that the counselor already has a set of pretty transferable skills to work in this very different way, to meet the client in a different place. My guess is there's also some disadvantages, though. 

00:05:10
JACQUI ATKINSON There are disadvantages, and just coming back to that point about meeting a client in dif-, a different place, um, people can be in different time zones and they disappear. 

00:05:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right, right. Now, I mean, I know that you actually work partly in the UK 

00:05:25
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, I do. 

00:05:25
MIKE SIMMONS and partly in Portugal, 

00:05:30
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes. 

00:05:30
MIKE SIMMONS but as far as you're clients are concerned, you're Jacqui in the same place on their computer or whatever. 

00:05:35
JACQUI ATKINSON But interestingly, Portugal is actually in the same time zone as Britain. It, it's only when you go across Spain. 

00:05:45
MIKE SIMMONS That it changes. 

00:05:45
JACQUI ATKINSON And then the time zone changes. But it really doesn't matter. 

00:05:50
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, but there are going to be disadvantages. 

00:05:50
JACQUI ATKINSON Of course there are. 

00:05:50
MIKE SIMMONS Tell me about them. 

00:05:50
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes. The counselor, of course, has to get used to working in a slightly different way. They also need to be comfortable with technology, um, and the client too, otherwise this isn't going to work because the technology will take over rather than being counseling being the main focus. 

00:06:10
MIKE SIMMONS Right, so this whole range of things that people that are used to the technology, that want to engage in this way. Then there are people who can't engage easily in a straightforward, face-to-face way who are gonna have to be using the technology, and for them it may be more of a challenge. And then for the counselor who is engaging with them via new technologies, then they've got to be comfortable too. Quite a lot going on there. 

00:06:40
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, there is, and this is one of the reasons why um, there's a lot of discussion at the contracting stage about what technology the client would like to use. The counselor will only offer the technologies that are suitable for them. If a counselor is hard of hearing, they won't offer some of the technologies that use the spoken word. 

00:07:00
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. Okay, so I've got my client, I'm comfortable with the technology, what other sort of things I'm gonna need to be aware of? What are the issues that are gonna come up? 

00:07:10
JACQUI ATKINSON The issues often are around technology failure. So it's really useful for the counselor to have two computers so if one does fail, they can actually move to another computer. For the client, they may well not have two computers, but during the contracting phase they will have exchanged telephone numbers in case of technology breakdown so that they don't feel totally sort of lost and bereft that the counselor's deserted them. 

00:07:45
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. Uh, and I'm wondering about whether the client behaves differently in this non-face-to-face setting. 

00:07:50
JACQUI ATKINSON If they're not used to using these technologies, they may do to start with, but once the work gets going, um, they become at ease and what they're working with is their issue. So almost the technology disappears. You're actually um, they're working with you as a practitioner and the counselor is working with the client sort of inside that screen somewhere. 

00:08:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right, right. And I think I heard you talk about something uh, online disinhibition? 

00:08:25
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, it's an interesting one, the online disinhibition. It means that our clients can often go a lot deeper in the work a lot quicker than they might do face-to-face which is something that people, until they actually experience it, find very hard to believe. But it's, I liken it a little bit to them using Facebook and sort of splurging things onto Facebook that are actually ill-advised to say and let the whole world see. This with the counselor, I mean the whole world isn't seeing it, but it's just a matter of making sure that the clients pace themselves. If they go too deeply too quickly, particularly if they're talking around some trauma, they can become re-traumatized rather than do some work towards recovery. 

00:09:20
MIKE SIMMONS 'Kay, I mean there's, there's quite a lot of things here. I'm thinking about um, I guess we're all familiar with the face-to-face client who comes in for the first session and just talks this tremendous amount of information that comes out. And, and you're sitting there as a counselor thinking "Where, where am I going to get in here? What's going on?" But, but I think what I'm hearing you say is also that they will go deeper, that they're more likely to be talking about the things that a face-to-face client might wait several sessions to start talking about which is a whole load of material and important material to engage in. That makes me wonder about the empathic response, how, how we kind of manage to pick up everything important that's being said uh, when there's so much of it. And I guess it's something about focusing here. 

00:10:10
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, there is. You've also got the situation where clients may well type an enormous amount of stuff in an email and you do have a therapeutic hour to work with so you'll do a lot of work on maybe the first three quarters of the email, but need to be careful to say, "I've dealt with X and I hear Y and Z as well, but if you would like to bring those back to the next session, we can work with those because I'm coming towards the end of my hour's work with you." 

00:10:45
MIKE SIMMONS Well that brings me very nicely to my next question because I was gonna ask you about boundaries cuz boundaries are things that are important for counselors generally uh, and I wonder whether there are new boundaries as well as the old ones that we need to be aware of in this work. 

00:11:00
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, there are. Uh, there are a number of boundaries in the ways that they need to work and this is all put into the contract. And because clients have your telephone number, because they have your email address, because they have your Skype address, then it's very easy for them to contact you outside of sessions. It's ve-, and absolutely vital when using Skype that if you're working with a client, you set your status to "busy" or "Do not disturb" so that somebody else can't sort of try to attract your attention. And that would disrupt the thought and the process. Um, it's about deciding when to respond to emails. I, I always try to give myself at least one day a week where I don't work. And it's about having also um, different email addresses. 

00:11:55
MIKE SIMMONS Right, I'm conscious that you actually got three email addresses: one is for personal use, friends and family. 

00:12:00
JACQUI ATKINSON Correct. 

00:12:00
MIKE SIMMONS One is for contact with clients, and one is with something called SafeMail which is for actually working with clients. 

00:12:10
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, it's, helps me keep my work-life balance by doing that. And clients normally contact me through my main contact email and that's the way we will contract and there will be questions going backwards and forwards. That's where we would um, also negotiate times to meet or times in the week or what might happen. The SafeMail address is um, a secure encrypted email system that I will use during the actual work. And it, it needs a client to want to use it as well, but it is so useful in the fact that I can actually see on my scree when the email's been delivered to the client and then, even more usefully, I can see exactly when they've read it. So if I notice that the client has read an email, but then there is a longer-than-normal pause before they make any response, I can just do a gentle inquiry as if to check if everything's all right. 

00:13:15
MIKE SIMMONS Bit like saying to a client in your room, "You're very quiet. You haven't said anything for a few minutes. I'm wondering what's going on." 

00:13:25
JACQUI ATKINSON Precisely. 

00:13:25
MIKE SIMMONS I mean, I'm just thinking about what you were saying about your email and your Skype. Uh, I'm conscious when I'm on the computer, I've got my Skype online status as sort of open, I'm online, I've got my emails kind of coming in all the time on two different accounts, uh, and that works fine for me, but I'm not working as an online counselor. That would be the worst possible environment for you to be working in. 

00:13:55
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, it would be chaotic if at one moment I was opening an email from a family member and the next moment I'm opening an email from a client just because they happen to be alerting me and I sort of switch between them quickly, and the next moment I'm trying to write a piece of work for a client. Um, for me that would be incredibly chaotic so I try to go to my computer either to work on private email or to work on the work emails and to have a break in between. 

00:14:25
MIKE SIMMONS Ah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm conscious that there's something dreadfully inviting when you see who's online on Skype to just say "hello" or to friends, family, "what are you doing?" that kind of thing. You don't want your clients doing that. 

00:14:40
JACQUI ATKINSON I don't want the clients sort of coming in to that uh, at all, no. 

00:14:45
MIKE SIMMONS We're going to be talking about all these technologies in more detail in a moment, but before we move on to that, I think it would be helpful for me, as you know from our communications when we've been planning this, to just explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication. 

00:15:00
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes. 

00:15:00
MIKE SIMMONS I do know really. 

00:15:05
JACQUI ATKINSON I know you know really. Um, synchronous communication is when both the counselor and the client are at their machines, what, whatever machine that is, at exactly the same time. It's synchronized. 

00:15:20
MIKE SIMMONS So this is a synchronous communication? 

00:15:20
JACQUI ATKINSON This is a synchronous communication. An asynchronous communication are those moments when I send you an email and you pick it up an hour, two hours, or the next day, where each person sits at their technology at a different time and sends and receives. 

00:15:40
MIKE SIMMONS And responds in their time. 

00:15:40
JACQUI ATKINSON Absolutely. 

00:15:40
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. So let's start looking at these technologies one by one. Where should we start? 

00:15:50
JACQUI ATKINSON Should we start with email? 

00:15:50
MIKE SIMMONS So what's that? Synchronous, or asynchronous? 

00:15:50
JACQUI ATKINSON That's asynchronous because each person is writing in their own time in their own space and there's not a direct communication in real-time. 

00:16:00
MIKE SIMMONS So what the issues with email? How does it all work? 

00:16:05
JACQUI ATKINSON Well, it works by the client sending me an email asking something like, "Have you got space for um, for me to have some counseling sessions?" They may um, say a little bit about why they want counseling or they may not. I will then respond to that as soon as I receive it with um, a contract attached, answering any of their questions, and explaining to them that when they have filled in the contract and asked any questions they wish, that we can then begin the work. So at that point um, the client may ask more questions, I will answer them. They will, when they're ready, send their first email to me uh, containing the work either within the email or as an attachment. When I receive that I will save it both on my computer and on a memory stick and I will send what we call a "holding response" which says something like "I will respond to you within the next 48 hours. Thank you for your inquiry-, Thank you for your email." 

00:17:15
JACQUI ATKINSON So you've now got two copies of that email, essentially. One on your computer, one on a memory stick, and my guess is that's just a belt-and-braces thing for security so if something happens to the computer, you still have a record, you haven't lost the client's statement almost. 

00:17:30
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, it's belt-and-braces from that point of view, but it also means that when I move location, I've got the memory stick to take with you because that, I won't, I won't be taking my main computer from home, I'll be taking my laptop with me. 

00:17:45
MIKE SIMMONS So what happens next? 

00:17:45
JACQUI ATKINSON When I start to work on that email I open it up and it, there are two ways of working. Either you can read through the whole of their text and then begin to respond, or you can respond as if you were in a dialogue with them in the room, and I often found that's best because I'm not then carrying anything from further down their, what they've written and I will respond by changing the color from their font color so that I intersperse my comments and responses within their text. 

00:18:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right. And I'm just imagining um, a kind of counseling uh, transcript that we're very familiar with, client statement, counselor statement, client statement, counselor statement, and it feels like you get a whole sequence of client statements and then you fit the counselor statements in, responding to the different bits that need responses as, as a second thin layer. What next? 

00:18:50
JACQUI ATKINSON I will then double-save that again. Um, often there is a pause. You write and it gives you a chance to save it, and then go away and do something else for a while and just think about what you've written and how it's likely to come across and be able to come back to it and make any amendments you might wish. When you're happy with it, you then send it to the client and they have received it and they will respond back again, maybe using exactly the same transcript and changing the color yet again. These can get quite bulky if it just continues like that, everybody changing color, but one of the things that you start to do is to delete stuff from the current email that actually has been dealt with. It's saved by both counselor and client if you want to go back, and I normally invite the client that, look, I've deleted a little bit here, if there's anything that you think we've finished with for the moment, please do feel free to delete it so that it doesn't become too cumbersome. 

00:20:00
MIKE SIMMONS Gosh, there are some really interesting things here cuz in, in some way what, this is something the client has said, this is something the client's given you, and you've got to be quite sensitive about how you delete it, how that happens cuz, "This is the stuff I was talking about my mother and you've removed it!" 

00:20:15
JACQUI ATKINSON Absolutely, it's about putting in that reassurance, and I normally, the first bit I do is normally something very, sort of minimal, maybe from the beginning where they may have said to me, "Jacqui, are you well?" You know, cuz clients often want to know that their therapist is well and take whatever stuff they wish to bring. 

00:20:35
MIKE SIMMONS Now, all this communication is taking place via SafeMail which 

00:20:40
JACQUI ATKINSON If the client chooses it to be SafeMail, yes. 

00:20:40
MIKE SIMMONS Now, I've not heard of this before, but it's a secure system, you pay for it? 

00:20:50
JACQUI ATKINSON No, you download it and it's a free system. 

00:20:55
MIKE SIMMONS You have it, the client has it, and it encrypts in some way. 

00:20:55
JACQUI ATKINSON And it encrypts, yes. 

00:20:55
MIKE SIMMONS I see. One thing that strikes me is that in face-to-face work we pick up lots of non-verbal clues and cues about how the client is. We look at their pattern of speech, how they're sitting, all sorts of things. I'm wondering how that translates to email. 

00:21:20
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, it's a slightly different set of skills because you can't see your client with email so you're picking up clues from the way they write. And as time goes on, you be-, you know how your client writes, you know the frequency, and if say, they normally write their emails in the evening and all of a sudden you read one that they've sent out at 3:00 in the morning, I might ask a very gentle question on, sort of, say to them, "I notice you sent this at 3:00 in the morning. I'm just wondering what is going on at the moment for you." If they normally write uh, say in a gentle green and change to red, this gives me a clue that maybe they're wanting to emphasize or maybe they're really feeling quite angry about something. It may be something I've said, it may be something in their world, but it just gives me a clue that their temperament has changed to a certain extent. 

00:22:20
MIKE SIMMONS A bit like capital letters. We will understand that shouting. 

00:22:25
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, and if they use capital letters, I need to gently check with them whether they're emphasizing or shouting because they may not know that um, technique of shouting. Sometimes I will emphasize something in the email, turning it into bold, underlining it, very occasionally I will move into capitals, but always with an explanation. "I'm going to use capitals here for emphasis," and then do it, not do it and explain afterwards. 

00:23:00
MIKE SIMMONS Right. Yeah, I've, I've done that just with colleagues' documents when they've wanted me to comment in the body of the document and I've always put, "I'm gonna do this in capitals so it shows up, but I'm not shouting." 

00:23:10
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, and I prefer the change of color to the use of capitals, but there are moments, particularly if the client is um, really um, sort of out of touch with themselves. Um, I had one recently where, I, I use a lot of clear space in the email saying, "Please pause here. Please take a deep breath." More space. "Please now feel your feet on the ground." Because I felt that they were talking about a past trauma and because emails, you can read so much more um, in the, say, four-minute time than you can say in four minutes of face-to-face work that I wanted them to really, really slow down and to just take care of themselves. 

00:24:05
MIKE SIMMONS And thinking of a number of issues which we haven't discussed in preparing for this filming. Uh, one is around whether clients choose to print out or to read on the screen, one is around monochrome or color printers. I mean, I know most printers in people's homes are color, but lots of people at work have black and white laser printers, and just making sure you know how the client is going to be reading what you've written so that it's in a way that they are going to be able to see your interactions clearly. Yeah. Is there anything else about email that we need to consider? 

00:24:50
JACQUI ATKINSON Well, just picking up on the point you made there, and occasionally somebody will send me an email without an attachment and there'd be writing in the email in a format where color isn't available. 

00:25:00
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:25:05
JACQUI ATKINSON So I then have the choice of responding by changing the font and maybe putting asterisks before what I say, or the um, to copy and paste it into a Word document and send it back as an attachment. But I, in doing either of those, I need to also be asking the client which way would you prefer? I, I don't know whether clients do print out or not. I don't print out except very occasionally if I want to take a piece to talk about um, in a face-to-face supervision. If I'm talking about it in my online supervision, then I can have it on the screen and I can either have two machines running at once or I can have a split screen. 

00:25:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. Yeah, okay. And I think there's something about you use out-of-office um, messages on your email. 

00:26:00
JACQUI ATKINSON Absolutely vital uh, on my work email, it's a courtesy on my private one, that if I'm going to be away from my computer for any length of time, that I actually put an out-of-office message there, explaining maybe why I'm away, either that I'm on holiday or I'm indisposed, uh, so that any new inquiries realize that I'm not going to get back to them. They have a choice then that they either move and contact somebody else or they wait for me re-, to return. Normally, all the clients I'm working with I will have told if I'm going to be away, but there's always the odd client that maybe you've worked with for quite some time and they're taking a pause and you don't know how long the pause is and you're allowing them the space. And if all of a sudden uh, I need to go into hospital for a few days, you know, they need to know it if they come back rather than me just having gone AWOL. 

00:27:05
MIKE SIMMONS Uh, I'm just imagining in, in face-to-face work uh, the counselor makes an invention, the client wants to really think about it, they sit in silence, the client then looks up and find the counselor's just left the room, that's, that's what you're replicating. 

00:27:20
JACQUI ATKINSON Absolutely. A little bit disconcerting. 

00:27:25
MIKE SIMMONS A little bit. Okay, what should we look at next? 

00:27:25
JACQUI ATKINSON How about looking at texting? 

00:27:30
MIKE SIMMONS And is that synchronous or asynchronous? 

00:27:30
JACQUI ATKINSON That is usually synchronous, but it can of course be asynchronous because a client can send a text message that the counselor might receive and look at later or they can both be there with their phones, texting as in a real-time conversation. 

00:27:50
MIKE SIMMONS I guess a lot of people will be familiar with the idea of a client texting them to say they're held up in traffic, they're gonna be late or they need to cancel a session, something like that, but using texting therapeutically feels like quite a different issue. But I guess there are some similarities to email here. 

00:28:10
JACQUI ATKINSON There are some similarities to email, and yes, you're right on your initial point that clients might often use texting to confirm, change an appointment, cancel an appointment, say "I'm being held up." Uh, we're assuming there, of course, that both client and counselor are in areas that receive texting. There are still many dead areas where actually one or other will not be able to use or send and, and receive. 

00:28:40
MIKE SIMMONS I live in one. 

00:28:40
JACQUI ATKINSON I live in one too. When it comes to the actual work, um, texting is one of those things that I think is used predominantly by the younger people who are so used to the whole of their world being around texting. A lot of the time clients will use abbreviations and it's about both parties being familiar with what they mean or asking if they're not sure. The other huge difference uh, between texting and emailing is that it's shorter sentences, it's a, it will be a, a shorter session. You're not likely to do an hour-long session. 

00:29:25
MIKE SIMMONS Feels like quite a challenge to it. Feels quite daunting. Uh, just the idea of working with a client in that way. Do you see it as a viable way of solely offering counseling support or as an adjunct to some other way of working? 

00:29:40
JACQUI ATKINSON I think it would be fair to say that it, in the current time, it is probably an adjunct for the majority. There are a minority of people, young people in school, say. They want some counseling, they don't want to go to the counselor in school because they don't want to be seen, they don't want to have any counseling and tell their parents, so they may access it using texting and for them it is the sole way. It's something that, a little bit like the other technologies, as the years go on, we will probably get more and more used to it being a normal thing. 

00:30:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, I'm sure that's right. I'm wondering how this is different from instant messaging. 

00:30:25
JACQUI ATKINSON It's different from instant messaging in the fact that instant messaging um, both people are sitting at their computers at the same, so that is synchronous, and you're sort of typing to each other using whatever color text you wish to use. Um, instant messaging, you can do wherever you have a computer. You don't have to worry about dead spots at all. 

00:30:55
MIKE SIMMONS Right. It sounds like it's more flexible than texting, but more immediate than email in some way. You're both there at the same time. 

00:31:00
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, it is flexible in the fact that you can say a lot more in one go um, with instant messaging. The inflexible bit of it is that both the counselor and the client have to have diaried a time to meet. 

00:31:15
MIKE SIMMONS Right just like face-to-face work. 

00:31:20
JACQUI ATKINSON Absolutely. 

00:31:20
MIKE SIMMONS 2:00 on Tuesday. 

00:31:20
JACQUI ATKINSON Yeah. 

00:31:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah? Okay. Um, I'm conscious very much like, with email that with instant messaging, presumably both counselor and client end up with a written record of what's been talked about. 

00:31:35
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes. 

00:31:35
MIKE SIMMONS That must be really useful. There's something about, you know, with, with this whole thing, we were talking about transcripts earlier, here is an instant transcript. You said this, I said that, you said this. So we've got a real, something to track that. 

00:31:50
JACQUI ATKINSON There is something to track and that means that it, a client can return to what's been said uh, whilst they're processing it in the, in the time in between sessions. Um, practitioners, to begin with, find it quite scary because there's this business that it's, you've got it there for real and if a client takes you to court, what happens then? And it is a really good reminder that do not say anything in the therapeutic sessions that would not be able to stand up in court and defend having said. 

00:32:30
MIKE SIMMONS Right. Yes. Interesting. 

00:32:35
JACQUI ATKINSON Puts you on your mettle. 

00:32:35
MIKE SIMMONS Puts you on your mettle, I can see that. Now, I like to move on to audio/visual communication now. We tend to think if we, or I tend to think, when I think about audio/visual, I think of Skype. But it's maybe worth saying that Skype is one of a whole range of audio/visual communications. There's ooVoo, there's FaceTime, I think MSN does something very similar. Basically, it's about client and counselor both being able to see each other on the screen. But just to complicate matters, Skype also do an instant messaging system. It's a bit like Hoover and Biro, it's a kind of generic term. We're gonna use the word Skype simply to talk about the audio/visual bit, but we need to acknowledge there are lots of other systems out there. What are the first things we need to, to think about with Skype? What do we need, for a start? 

00:33:35
JACQUI ATKINSON Right, the basics are that you need a camera uh, to attach to your computer if there isn't one built in. Modern computers, laptops, often have a camera built in and will have speakers built in as well. For clarity, it's usually best to have um, a separate set of headphones with a microphone and then the webcam either attached to the top of the computer or built in. 

00:34:00
MIKE SIMMONS I've used Skype quite a lot in an office, not as a counselor, but just talking to colleagues uh, and then when it's a big open-plan office, obviously headphones are essential because otherwise you just can't hear what's going on. You also need a Skype account, you need to set that up. And how much does that cost? 

00:34:20
JACQUI ATKINSON Absolutely free. And just to come back for a moment, you were saying you used it in an office, um, it's also important when you're using this to know exactly what's behind you because the client is seeing that as well. And this one came home to me the other day when somebody had been into the room I use and had turned an ornament. It was a, a figure and my client came on and she said, "the lady's not in the same angle." And this really mattered to her that behind me things were different. 

00:34:55
MIKE SIMMONS So, this is just the sort of thing that we would talk to students about. In very early days of training, we'd be talking about how chairs might be positioned, we'd be talking about the environment you work in, we'd be saying, well, do you want to think about the messages that having a great big picture of your kids on the wall or this or that. And what you're saying is, this is all totally transferable to this new form of work. 

00:35:20
JACQUI ATKINSON Absolutely, absolutely transferable. Yes, I mean uh, behind me there is never any paperwork on a, a tabletop or anything, um, there may be a light if it's that sort of time of year, there is a plant, there are one or two ornaments uh, that clients can sort of become attached to, obviously. 

00:35:45
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, yeah. But what you're saying is, that needs to be thought out just as much as in face-to-face work. 

00:35:50
JACQUI ATKINSON Totally. As the same as you need to, just as you would before you go to do some face-to-face work, you think about what you wear. 

00:36:00
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, so I've got the equipment, I've the account, I've got the client, I've looked at the settings and so forth, what about actually working with a client over Skype, what's that like? 

00:36:10
JACQUI ATKINSON This is the closest you can get to working face-to-face. You can see each other. Um, the client normally on their screen would have myself as the practitioner uh, in fullscreen and they would have a small picture of themselves in the corner. I have them fullscreen so that I can observe if they're uh, feeling uncomfortable in their, that will show in their face, and I'll have a small picture of myself in the corner of the screen. So it's the easiest way to transfer from working face-to-face to working online. 

00:36:50
MIKE SIMMONS Right. So that might be a first step that someone took who was interested in doing this work. 

00:36:55
JACQUI ATKINSON You say that and it sounds logical there, but normally when people want to start working online, they feel safest working with email because you have got the asynchronicity of it so that they have got time to think and they don't feel as under pressure. 

00:37:10
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. So you, there's texting, there's email, there's audio/visual. How do you decide what you, what medium you're gonna work in? 

00:37:20
JACQUI ATKINSON I don't decide, um, I put that as a choice to the client and that comes into the contract where they will tell me which of the mediums they would like to choose and whether they would like to use just one or a variety. And we can of course renegotiate that as we work. The only time that I would make a decision on that is if I was somebody who was hard of hearing and I would not be offering chat or video chat. 

00:37:50
MIKE SIMMONS So this goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning, and I'm just thinking, I have a client, they are going on holiday next week, this is in my working time, they're choosing to go on holiday. I've been seeing them with Skype, but they may choose, they still want to see me, but they're going to "see me" in inverted commas, via email while they're away because they're going to go into an internet caf� for a session. They can choose to change the medium of communication. 

00:38:20
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, absolutely. 

00:38:20
MIKE SIMMONS I mean, I guess there's one other thing uh, worth mentioning. We're talking about computers, we've been talking about phones as if they're different things, but with the advent of smart phones, I mean, I've got Skype on my phone, I've got ooVoo on my, I mean, it's kind of. 

00:38:40
JACQUI ATKINSON Absolutely. And the small technologies are being used more and more as people travel around as a means of them accessing counseling. 

00:38:50
MIKE SIMMONS And I guess that in turn brings up a whole load of other issues because I've got Skype on my phone, that means I can contact, you might say, "try to contact" my client, my counselor at any time. 

00:39:10
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, and I need to make sure that you can't. 

00:39:10
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:39:15
JACQUI ATKINSON So I need to make sure that if I'm, any of the technology that I'm using that clients might uh, contact me, is not in the bedroom, is not, so that they're not trying wake me up at 3:00 in the morning. And that it's switched off and that I make sure that I go to it regularly to check for inquiries and clients' sessions, but that I'm not available 24/7. 

00:39:40
MIKE SIMMONS So I can't come out to the pub on a Saturday night and call you up for a session? 

00:39:45
JACQUI ATKINSON No thanks cuz I might still be in the pub. 

00:39:50
MIKE SIMMONS There we go. So what do reckon the future holds? 

00:39:50
JACQUI ATKINSON It'll be exciting. Um, the future that is already emerging is um, using virtual environments where counselor and client both choose avatars and the client might be invited into the counselor's virtual environment to work. This is something that is being used more in America and it is coming across here. Um, people need to be comfortable with it and it's, it, it's emerging and I think it's something that we will hear and see and use a lot more over the next 10 years or so. 

00:40:30
MIKE SIMMONS Now I got very excited about this a couple years ago and had a virtual counseling room built in our University's virtual island uh, and then I kind of sat back waiting for someone to show up and then I kind of was quite active about trying to get someone to show up and was asking students to volunteer to do roleplays. I wanted to feel like it, what it was like. No one ever came, so I sat sadly in my virtual room. No one ever came to see me. So it was kind of, I was ready for it, but they clearly weren't. 

00:41:10
JACQUI ATKINSON They weren't ready for it. And I think this is the case with a lot of people, that this, in counseling we talk a lot about congruence, and if you choose an avatar, where is the congruence with who you are, I think is one of the things that a lot of people feel. 

00:41:30
MIKE SIMMONS Well, and I think my avatar was pretty congruent; he was fairly scruffy and uh, maybe it's worth saying that an avatar is a representation of a person. 

00:41:40
JACQUI ATKINSON It's a representation and people will often choose avatars that are nothing like they are in real life. Now, for some that might be a real advantage and a real freedom. 

00:41:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, and that's something that the internet always offers, the opportunity to people to be what they'd like to be, to experiment with being different people. I think there's a rich source of exploration there as well. I'm also conscious that, God, must be 10 years ago, maybe longer, Norma James and I made a video on telephone counseling, it was longer, uh, that felt quite exciting and new at the time. There wasn't a lot of work being done in that way. Uh, now that seems really old hat, and all of this stuff 

00:42:30
JACQUI ATKINSON Is new, it's exciting, and it has its place. I mean, I can quite see working it and having a room that you might uh, when working with a client say, "Well, would you like to come into my virtual room and let's look at how you would like your world to be." So you would sort of use it um, as a different way of doing a sort of visualization to that question, How would you like your world to be? 

00:42:55
MIKE SIMMONS I mean, I read something very recently, a counselor who was working with their client using Google Earth, revisiting places of their childhood uh, as a therapeutic tool. Very interesting thought of using that technology in that way. And it resonated for me because I've actually quite enjoyed going back to my home town in Google Earth uh, and having a look at it. 

00:43:25
JACQUI ATKINSON Now, fascinating stuff. And as you say that, that triggers something for me. And, thinking of the client who made have been traumatized um, or has a phobia to do with place and how it might be useful to bring in and work with to help desensitize them. 

00:43:45
MIKE SIMMONS Very interesting. So there's this range of technologies, texting, instant messaging, audio/visual, and so on, but we know that there are more and more technologies coming along, that they're going to be a real value to our client and value to ourselves as well. 

00:44:05
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, more coming along, and I think more creativity in using the ones that we have. 

00:44:10
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, good point. Now, a question that's kind of interested me is around fees. 

00:44:15
JACQUI ATKINSON Doesn't it interest everybody? 

00:44:20
MIKE SIMMONS It does. But the, the, the basic model we have in face-to-face counseling is we charge so much an hour, never mind whether that's 50 minutes or an hour, we charge so much an hour. What do you do with this range of different ways of working? 

00:44:40
JACQUI ATKINSON If it's being paid for by a company, then it's very similar as face-to-face. Uh, as a practitioner, you will invoice a company after sessions. If however, it's a private individual who's contacted you and you're working with them online, the norm is to have the money up front. I see the look of surprise on your face and this does, it is something that can be quite tricky to get used to as a, a practitioner and saying, "Well yes, I'll work with you, thank you for the contract, when I see the money in my bank account then I will respond to your first email." Because clients, it would be very easy for them to have a counseling session and disappear and then move to another counselor and have a counseling session and disappear and never pay. 

00:45:30
MIKE SIMMONS But if they're on another continent, how do they pay? 

00:45:30
JACQUI ATKINSON They can pay directly into my bank account or they can use something called PayPal and uh, pay me through that. 

00:45:40
MIKE SIMMONS I think we've talked about this, but let's just make sure we sum up. What sort of equipment is someone moving into this kind of work likely to need? 

00:45:50
JACQUI ATKINSON You need a computer, you need the screen, you need a keyboard, you need a webcam, you need a memory stick, you need um, a set of headphones. If your go-, likely to be wanting to print anything, you'll need a printer. 

00:46:10
MIKE SIMMONS And what about software? What do I need and is it expensive? 

00:46:15
JACQUI ATKINSON To answer the second question first, no, it's not expensive. The majority of these things to download are absolutely free. Skype is free, MSN is free, ooVoo is free. They just need downloading onto your computer. 

00:46:30
MIKE SIMMONS And of course, you need a word processor and I think the one thing that we need to say about that is that word processor can be any particular product as long as it will read Microsoft Word documents and will save as Microsoft Word documents because that has become so much an international standard that if you can't do that, you're gonna be really disadvantaging your clients and yourself. You won't be able to send attachments that make sense to each other. 

00:47:00
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, you're right that the software needs to be compatible for both people. 

00:47:05
MIKE SIMMONS I think an, another issue that was just coming to my mind, and that is that we've talked about online counseling, we've talked about it something that people might move into, another way of working with their clients, but there's also something about working with existing face-to-face clients. Uh, for some reason or another, the client breaks a leg, their car breaks down, there're no busses in your area, and so on, that you might choose to have a session with a face-to-face client by means of these technologies as a way of maintaining contact. 

00:47:45
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, uh, that was one of the ways I used online counseling as a college counselor, predominantly after I had done my training as an online counselor um, that students who were off campus for one reason or another, they might be out on placement, they might be ill, members of staff too, so that we would have some face-to-face sessions, some sessions using technology. 

00:48:15
MIKE SIMMONS 'Kay. Another issue that's coming to mind is around security. If I work with a face-to-face client, the only record of that meeting and what's been discussed would be our memories, any notes that I took, and any notes that they took. After that, it's an entirely confidential process. Now it seems to me that working with technology, it's almost the reverse. The default position is for everything to be recorded, every email, every text message, every attachment, every instant messaging session is there for all time. What do you do? 

00:49:00
JACQUI ATKINSON What do you do? Um, you start right back at the contracting phase and you talk in the contract about security and encourage clients to make their own work in their, wherever they're doing it as secure as possible using passwords on computers, not necessarily sharing computers, if they are going to print anything off, if they're going to save anything onto memory sticks, to making sure that those are not accessible to other people. I need to do that myself as well and I need to when um, I finish work with a client, I need to tell them how long I will keep a record and when I will delete all of that from my systems, that's the computer and the memory sticks. It is not 100% secure and clients need to know this, but nothing we do online is 100% secure. Whatever we do to try and make it secure, somebody can always get round it and that's something that there needs to be that shift within the practitioner and clients that there is a risk. 

00:50:15
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. I mean, I'm, I'm conscious that there's something about the therapist doing all he or she can do to make sure that client material doesn't become available to any third party. And my partner doesn't do online work but obviously communicates with clients by email fairly regularly uh, and her computer is used by the family when they're here, but there are two accounts so that she logs in as her, they log in as visitors and they're password-protected so that no one can access her communications with them. 

00:50:50
JACQUI ATKINSON Absolutely, yes. Password-protected um, email accounts, password-protected computers. 

00:50:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, yes. Because the other issue here that we haven't touched on yet is just well, what happens when that computer gets a long in the tooth and you sell it, you need to make sure that you wipe the hard drive. 

00:51:10
JACQUI ATKINSON Either you wipe the hard drive or you get somebody to wipe the hard drive who you trust and they do it in front of you who knows how to wipe it. 

00:51:15
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, yes, absolutely. Okay, finally, uh, self care, that's always an issue uh, within the counseling world. How does the online therapist look after themselves? 

00:51:30
JACQUI ATKINSON Starting with basics with that, it's very easy when you start working online to get into the idea of, "I can be online all the time," and it's exciting to do so, and then it translates to, "I have to be online all the time," and that isn't healthy. I mean, if we have a job, we go home or we come out of our therapy room if our therapy room is at home. So it's about boundarying the time that you spend uh, doing the therapeutic work. I try to have one day a week where I don't do any work. It's normally a Sunday cuz that happens to suit me. I also take two holidays in the year that are computerless. As you mentioned earlier, Mike, I spend some of my time in Portugal. I take the computer there, I work when we're there because we're there for a number of weeks, but if I take a fortnight's holiday twice a year to other places, it's my break, it's the way I can start to look after myself. And as for anybody, we all need means of taking care of ourselves, and years ago I came across something called personal first aid kits. It was a, a training session I attended. And ever since then I've working with a, a first aid kit for myself and for my clients, I encourage them to develop one. And this is about having a range of things that we do that we enjoy to do to help us relax. There need to be things in there that are out, outdoors, indoors, relaxing things, maybe activity things, but things that take us away from the work. 

00:53:10
MIKE SIMMONS And are these things I would actually do or things that I would think about and remember? 

00:53:15
JACQUI ATKINSON Both. You can have whatever you wish in a personal first aid kit. 

00:53:20
MIKE SIMMONS So I have thought out strategies in advance that I know will help me to look after me. 

00:53:30
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, absolutely. And there are a number of things on my list, some of them only take a moment and one of them is as I drive uh, in Swansea down a hill, I look up and I look across and I see the city and just register how lovely it is. Other things need planning, like building in holidays. Um, a bar of chocolate, time to just stand and stare. 

00:53:55
MIKE SIMMONS Because without that, the technology will eat every moment of our time if we let it. 

00:54:05
JACQUI ATKINSON It will do and it can invite us to become ungrounded. 

00:54:10
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. I guess what was very clear as we come to the end of this is that technology is enhancing communication and reducing confidentiality, I wouldn't say secrecy, but things are becoming more and more public. We've talked about needing to hold on to data on our computers in a way that keeps it safe, but I'm conscious that whereas before we knew that our clients might talk to their friends about their counseling session, they may well now be putting great chunks of it onto Facebook. 

00:54:45
JACQUI ATKINSON Absolutely, and as a practitioner um, I would not be doing any of that, I would be holding the confidentiality very, very carefully and very securely, but I have no um, authority over what a client does with the stuff that we work on and they do have all those transcripts so there is a risk that they can go out there. If they do, um, and I suppose hopefully going back to that comment I made about going to court, if you don't say or do anything in a session that you couldn't uphold in a court, maybe it is another form of advertising. 

00:55:30
MIKE SIMMONS A nice thought. And I guess underneath all that is as the technology uh, evolves, we need to constantly maintain an awareness of the ethics behind how we work. Just cuz it's a change of medium that we might be working in doesn't mean that we don't have to maintain that awareness. 

00:55:50
JACQUI ATKINSON Absolutely, and BACP are doing their own part in that as well. They recognize online counseling, they have guidelines for online counseling, and they're uh, they're absolutely embracing it as um, a different way of working. 

00:56:05
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. Any final thought? 

00:56:05
JACQUI ATKINSON Yes, um, it's very useful for anybody who wants to do this kind of work to have some training. It gives them the opportunity to practice transferring their skills from face-to-face to working online by using roleplay situations, with emails, with live sessions, with instant messaging sessions, video sessions so that they can get over any um, fears, anxieties they might have about the technology and get used to being in front of the technology, but looking through it at the client and the client's words. 

00:56:45
MIKE SIMMONS So not practicing on a client first of all. 

00:56:50
JACQUI ATKINSON No. 

00:56:50
MIKE SIMMONS Thank you very much, Jacqui. That's been really interesting. 

00:56:55
JACQUI ATKINSON Thank you, Mike.
