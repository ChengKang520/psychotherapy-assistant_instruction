RICH SIMON Welcome everyone, it's Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker. And welcome to this Webcast series on engaging men in therapy. And our subject today is uh, the always exciting topic of sexuality, male sexuality. And it is my pleasure to introduce our guest today, Esther Perel. Whose. 

00:00:30
ESTHER PEREL Hi, Rich. 

00:00:30
RICH SIMON Written the issue of sexuality and is known for uh, her book, Mating in Captivity. And is a frequent contributor to the Networker and presenter at the Network Conference. Esther, welcome! 

00:00:45
ESTHER PEREL Thank you. 

00:00:45
RICH SIMON All right, so let's, let's start up. One of the, the reasons that we invited you to be part of um, this series is that um, you and I have spoken many number of times about your work. And you seem to be an uh, someone, a woman who really particularly enjoys working with men. And you have a large number of uh, male clients. So, to start off, do you, when you're, let's, let's, let's talk about the context of individual therapy. When you're working with uh, a woman client is there, is, what stands out for you as, as uh, the difference in your experience as a therapist working with your female clients and broadly speaking with your male clients? 

00:01:35
ESTHER PEREL I think what stands out um, that is, it's not so much that it's different as in what's unique for me in working with uh, men is that my experience sometimes is that when I'm work with a woman. Which love no less. I do have a sense that I'm, that someone else may have already heard this. I may not be. 

00:01:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:01:55
ESTHER PEREL The first person that this topic is being spoken about or addressed or. When a man tells me something I often know that it is being articulated out loud for the first time. And there is a certain honor, privilege, trust, uh, invitation into the inferiority of the man in this particular person that I know that something is happening for a first. And that is a special quality, you know. That to be invited into their vulnerability, into their internal life, into their sexual world, subjects about which men have to lie a great amount. And especially. 

00:02:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:02:35
ESTHER PEREL To other men. Um, and there is often and experience that some men have where they feel more at ease to speak with a certain woman. You know, on the one hand the woman can be critical, judgmental, make them feel inadequate, hold their sexuality captive and all of that. On the other end the woman is also the one with whom they don't compete about being the real man. 

00:02:55
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:02:55
ESTHER PEREL And to whom they have to show their adequacy, and their competence, and their endowment, and all of that. So there, it goes both ways working around the subject of sexuality in particular with men from the perspective of a woman. And showing them that I am at ease, that I am not judging, that I don't come with a pre-approve-, pre-, uh, how do you say it, preconceived notion of sexuality as predatory, as aggressive, as violent, as hurtful, as frequent, automatic, uh, you know. 

00:03:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:03:30
ESTHER PEREL Perpetual motion machine. That I don't bring that whole baggage. 

00:03:35
RICH SIMON So turn, turn that up, turn that around a bit. So those are some of the things you don't bring in. So, in a concrete way when. Let's, let's talk about a guy, uh, you have a male client who's coming in. And it's um, it's a first session, it's early on in therapy, can, how is it, how might you begin to bring up the. And let's assume for the moment his presenting issue is not a sexual difficulty or, or some kind of, uh, concern with sex with some ways. How do you uh, bring up the topic of sexuality in, in your work with male clients? And what context and how might you begin the conversation? 

00:04:15
ESTHER PEREL If I'm talking about self-esteem I will talk about sexuality. If I'm talking about performance and competence I will talk about sexuality. If I'm talking about identity and gender, and masculinity I will talk about sexuality. If I'm talking about relationships I will talk about sexuality. It's an integrated part. I don't wait for the moment when I think it's fine to start. 

00:04:45
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:04:45
ESTHER PEREL And what about, you know. It's really, and does this influence yourself in sexual way. And in sexuality do you experience it the same way? 

00:04:55
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:04:55
ESTHER PEREL If we're talking about anxiety, about a guy who's head is running 24/7, he's all the time. I said, "When is there a moment when you can stop?" Is there a moment when your mind gets to rest? And then sometimes I may even say, "Is sex the one place where your mind finally stops?" 

00:05:10
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:05:10
ESTHER PEREL Is that a place where you finally feel you are present in the moment, at least for the time it lasts? And then we begin to make the connection. So I have a sense of what sexuality can mean and where it can fit in the various parts of a person's life. And I just make the link. I say, you know, you're telling me that you don't feel that you are able to feel competent and confident. And that you know what you want or that you can go after what you want. And then I will say, “What about women? Or what about men?", if it's a gay man. And then I may say, "And in sex do you know how to go for what you like?" Or is sex easier in this domain or harder in this domain? 

00:05:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:05:55
ESTHER PEREL And it, it's woven in. And so it, it takes on, a, another component. It's not like the holy grail with. 

00:06:05
RICH SIMON Okay. Well that makes a lot of sense. So, now is, is it your impression that, that, so that seems so often, just as part of your way of beginning your relationship. Whatever you're exploring, the sexual dimension is something that you're gonna be asking about? 

00:06:25
ESTHER PEREL Yes. 

00:06:25
RICH SIMON Does it have to be, someone just has to be presenting about, this is not a hot potato as far. 

00:06:30
ESTHER PEREL Right. 

00:06:30
RICH SIMON You're concerned. 

00:06:30
ESTHER PEREL That's right. And because if you understand sexuality as an integrated part of who we are, of our identity, or our gender construction, um, of our femininity, masculinity, self-esteem, receiving, giving, abandonment issues, obliteration fears, uh, pleasure and connection then sexuality is one domain in which we experience all those things. At some point if you talking to be about self confidence obviously I'm gonna not just ask how do you deal with money, how do you deal with your boss. I am gonna ask how do you deal with your body, how do you deal with pleasure, and how do you deal with sexual connections? 

00:07:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:07:10
ESTHER PEREL It's kind of an obvious. It's almost strange to leave it out, rather than. 

00:07:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:07:15
ESTHER PEREL Or integrated. 

00:07:15
ESTHER PEREL Yeah, yeah. No that makes a lot of sense. So, in, in, in terms of uh, now you and I had talked about that you're sense is that there lot of misconceptions about male sexuality. That therapist have certain ideas and beliefs about men and their sexuality that uh, don't seem in your view very founded in your own experience and, and in your reading of literature. So, what is, what, what are some of those misconceptions that you think sometimes lead therapist astray? 

00:07:50
ESTHER PEREL I think you can sum it up in, in a few uh, categories quite easily. Men are creatures of biology and women are creatures of meaning. 

00:08:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:08:05
ESTHER PEREL Men, more, you know, sexuality in men is more frequent, more stable. The preferences are set more early, it's more rigid, it's more narrow. It's biologic driven. It's concord with their physical arousal and it is less affected by mood or by intrastate or by interpersonal. It is less related. Um, but it's not because women care more about something that men care not at all. More or less doesn't turn something into a categorical difference. 

00:08:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:08:40
ESTHER PEREL Um, you know, the notion that um, that sexual desire in men is uncomplicated, that it's a simple biological force that is either indiscriminately seeking on, on an outlet or impaired by hormonal deficiency this notion is one. That men's mood does not effect them when in fact we know that depression and anxiety are no less strong factors influencing male sexual desire. Um, in 42% of, of men respond to depression, 28% to anxiety but what is different maybe is that men will use that eternal state to turn to sex to regulate their mood. 

00:09:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:09:25
ESTHER PEREL So the same anx-, experience of anxiety will often lead a man to actually turn to sex, to masturbation in that sense to actually relieve them of that mood. Or that male sexuality is not related when in fact, um, so much of what we know is that what turns men on more than anything is a partner's desire, male or female, a partner's pleasure, and their contribution to the pleasure of their partner, and to a partner feeling good about themselves. 

00:09:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:09:55
ESTHER PEREL Um, and so, it's extremely related or male sexuality being affected by shame, about this thing that society has all along may look as dirty and predatory, and dangerous, and aggressive. So there is a lot of shame. There's a lot of guilt, I don't want to hurt anybody. And there's a lot of um, fear of rejection. And fear of inadequacy. And if those are not relational components then I don't know how others to look. Uh, what other way to look at male sexuality. Who is rejecting them? A partner. Who makes them feel inadequate? A partner. Who makes them feel guilty or whom do they feel guilt? A partner. It is extremely um, uh, relational. And so, you know, I think that men are often more lonely than selfish um, in their experience of sexuality. And that will often emphasize the selfness of male sexuality and not the loneliness. And we often emphasize the aggressive and the violent side of male sexuality and not the vulnerability. And as I am I like to look at the sides that are less uh, less represented because I think they get obscured in favor, in favor of others that have truth to them but. 

00:11:15
RICH SIMON So. 

00:11:15
ESTHER PEREL That don't capture the whole picture. 

00:11:15
RICH SIMON So, so how does? So these are, are themes this is part of your thinking and your uh, someone's who's very uh, uh, puts, sees these issues in, in cultural context. Who does this, how do these issues come into the conversation? Do you do a lot of teaching? Do you talk in general terms uh, in the ways that you've just been talking about misconceptions, about sexuality? How do these ideas then translate into the conversation and into the relationship you have with, with men they're exploring uh, these questions of sexuality for themselves? 

00:11:55
ESTHER PEREL But sometimes they're not even exploring the question of sexuality. I'll give you an example of a man who came in, that I saw this week, who comes in talking about um. No, I happen to know that he has been very dissatisfied for awhile. It's changed quite a bit in terms of the relationship he has um, with his, in this case it's his wife. 

00:12:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:12:20
ESTHER PEREL Um, and I will give you straight and gay examples. 

00:12:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:12:20
ESTHER PEREL And he comes in to talk about the fact she was gonna, he was gonna have a day off. And wife asked him to pick up his daughter. And it turned into this, my day's ruined and now I can't enjoy my day off. And so, she offered to go to do it himself, herself but now it's too late. And it becomes this talking about how he sacrifices himself. 

00:12:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:12:45
ESTHER PEREL But he, you know, all his sacrifices are accumulated mileage points that he never cashes in on. So it, it's like he, she owes him but he will never actually receive because you know, it's tainted. And then, you know, I asked him, and tell me something. I know, in, in the middle of a sentence, like that I say, "So, what happens that you can only feel that you are receiving or that you are being pleased if there is almost no other with their own needs or wanting?" Which means you need another that is totally submissive. Is that what in sex? And so, then from there he just continues, you know, only a totally submissive can satisfy me. Since there is no other person, and all they want is to please me. The only desire that matters is my desire. And then I can want and I can receive with all the attention of me because only my pleasure matters. But in reality the way I live is that I feel that I have to devote 100% to please others. And so now we have two templates. The one in his fantasy life. The one in his, you know, where he imagines a space that he created for himself where somebody is completely devoted to him. In contrast with the way he experiences himself in life. Which is that he's devoted, resentful, and humiliated by being so attentive to others. And the way we got to that is because I began to ask him, you know, I said, I have this formula that is, works as a formula, you know. It's not a tool, but. 

00:14:25
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:14:25
ESTHER PEREL "Tell me how you were loved and I will tell you how you make love." Because in. 

00:14:30
RICH SIMON Say that one again. Tell, tell me how you were loved as, as a child or? 

00:14:35
ESTHER PEREL As a child, as a child. 

00:14:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:14:40
ESTHER PEREL Tell me how you were loved and I will. 

00:14:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:14:40
ESTHER PEREL Tell you how you make love. See we all have the notion, tell me how you were loved and I'll tell you how you love. But it goes a step further. Our emotional history, our history of attachment, if you want, our history of how we learn to love and connect, and be protected, and there, and want, and be please, and all of that is inscribed into the physicality of sex. It is written in our bodies. It's imprinted in us and therefore the way we make love is a metaphoric language that actually tells a story of how we were loved. 

00:15:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:15:15
ESTHER PEREL In that sentence somehow, you know, it, it, it is clear enough and ambiguous. 

00:15:20
RICH SIMON Say, say the sentence again. It's? 

00:15:25
ESTHER PEREL It's basically the remaking of erotic blueprint. 

00:15:25
RICH SIMON Yes. 

00:15:25
ESTHER PEREL Tell me how you were loved and I will tell you how you make love. 

00:15:30
RICH SIMON How you make love. Okay. 

00:15:35
ESTHER PEREL So if, I knew. 

00:15:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:15:35
ESTHER PEREL How you loved, were you protected or did you have to flee for protection? Where you allowed to want or did somebody tell you what do you need that for? You don't need this. Where you allowed to thrive? Or where you constantly, you know, encouraged to hold in, to contract? Visualize it on the body of somebody. Visualize it in love making until you can literally see the emotional experience translated into the physical experience. Where you allowed to laugh out loud or did you learn to do like this, you know? That sounds. 

00:16:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:16:10
ESTHER PEREL Kind of strange, right. But some people make love without a peep. 

00:16:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:16:10
ESTHER PEREL Now that takes an enormous oppression, suppression process to make people do something that is almost impossible to do without sound. If it only is the sound of breath. And if people don't breathe well, they don't experience their bodies fully. They're not present, they can't experience pleasure and they have lots of sexual difficulties. Tell me if you know, if you were held, if you were rocked, if you were soothed, or if you were humiliated or violated or invaded. That gives me a very different set of sense of your boundaries. Of how you experience touch, and soft touch or hard touch, and all of that. Tell me if you fear abandonment or if you fear obliteration. When you come close to someone are you afraid you're going to lose them or are you afraid you're going to lose yourself? If you feel that you're afraid of abandonment, and this is a continuum, loss of self or loss of the other. 

00:17:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:17:10
ESTHER PEREL You know, when you enter another, not just their orifices but the universe of another, in love making, are you afraid that when you come out they won't be there? Then you can't completely enter yourself because you are constantly making sure that they're not going away. And so you're staying focused on them. And if you can't at some point bring the focus on you, you basically can't "come". On the other hand, if you're afraid if the other person enters you they're going to feel that they lose themselves. And so, the moment it's over, the moment of copulation over they instantly retreat, they instantly need to constitute themselves, recreate their boundaries because they're so afraid to dissolve by virtue of the connection that's just been created. 

00:17:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:17:55
ESTHER PEREL When you describe it like that, people they see themselves, they see themselves in the act, in the experience. 

00:18:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:18:00
ESTHER PEREL In the act of their mind as well, not just the act of itself of sex. And they begin to understand the emotional history that is written in their bodies. 

00:18:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:18:10
ESTHER PEREL Now the second level is not just tell me how you were loved and I'll tell you how you make love but tell me about your erotic fantasies. And I will know. 

00:18:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:18:20
ESTHER PEREL The deepest emotional needs that you bring to sex. 

00:18:25
RICH SIMON So, let's slow down this on this. This seems, this seems this, this is a uh, an interesting idea here. So now, what did, how do you introduce this? IS this something that you might talk about in a first session with clients? And this seems like a lot to begin to absorb. This is uh, this is a very interesting thing and powerful idea here. How do, do people get this when you begin to introduce this into the thing and when might you? Is this something, is this the kind of conversation you have with every client or are there certain uh, or is there a particular point or a certain kind of client? 

00:19:05
ESTHER PEREL Good question. 

00:19:05
RICH SIMON Will you bring up these issues? 

00:19:05
RICH SIMON Look, it's different for me because a lot of people do come to me today as individuals but especially as couples to bring some topics related to sexuality, to desire, to lack of sex in the couple, or to infidelity. So, I have a kind of a door right away. But no, it's not every first session. But I'll tell you a piece around men in particular that uh, is often actually quite illuminating and I often have brought up in the first session. But my first session is not an hour long, it's a minimum of two hours. 

00:19:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:19:40
ESTHER PEREL To begin. 

00:19:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:19:45
ESTHER PEREL It's when you have a story between which is typical presenting story around sexuality in a couple where um, one, but I could say this in a man alone as well or. 

00:19:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:19:55
ESTHER PEREL I could say it with a woman alone about her partner. 

00:20:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:20:00
ESTHER PEREL So I can do it in three forms. 

00:20:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:20:00
ESTHER PEREL Where he is the pursuant if you want, and he um, he, he feels rejected, he feels lonely, he is often very irritable about it. He's like a little kid in the crib shaking, you know, pick me up, pick me up but of course he's not saying it in those ways. And she's, she in this case it's more a she than another he uh, will say you know, get off my back I want to be left alone, you know, you're breathing down. And what I begin to translate is that I will ask, that's what I did recently. I said to him, I said, “Are you a caretaker?" And this is after she said, "No I do all of the things, etc." And I said, "No, but in a different sense of the word caretaking." Are you a person who often responds, for like, you have a whole bunch of employees. 

00:20:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:20:55
ESTHER PEREL You know that people often turn to you. I know that your, your siblings turn to you, your family relies on you. You're a responsive kind of guy who does a lot for other people, yes. Isn't, is that something? You know, yes he does. I said, "And tell me something. Is sex the one place where you expect, where you hope, and look for someone else to take care of you?" 

00:21:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:21:20
ESTHER PEREL Without having to work for it, without having to ask for it? Is sex the place where you actually don't have to be the responsible guy who takes care of everybody else? The place where you don't have to be the decision maker. The place where you can let go, where you can be more soft, more tender, more vulnerable, and all of that. I ask, and the answer was yes, yes, yes. And I said, "You know, it's interesting because what happens to some people like you is that sexuality becomes of the body." Before sexuality the body becomes the place where men will often lodge the, uh, uh, how will I say disavowed feelings, you know, repudiated feelings. Feelings that men are not allowed to have. 

00:22:05
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:22:05
ESTHER PEREL Either by society or by family; fear, vulnerability, tenderness, softness, surrender, dependency, being needy, all of that. But it gets sexualize, it and because when you sexualize it then you don't feel like you're a needy little boy, you feel like you're a sexual man. But the women in this case will often experience this man's not coming at them as desiring and wanting. But she experiences him coming at her needing. And need invites caretaking not desire. 

00:22:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:22:40
ESTHER PEREL So she doesn't respond sexually, she doesn't like it. And she says all he wants is it, this thing. It has nothing to do with me. And he says no it has everything to do with you. It's you I want and I want you to want me. I can go and have sex on phone, online any minute. It's the connection I want. And then I begin to talk about, you know, it's an interesting thing because in a way when you don't get to be sexual with your wife it's an entire range of emotions and feelings that are actually being deprived. Because these feelings only come to exist in you, in the language of sex. 

00:23:20
RICH SIMON So let me stop you for a second. It's a lot to take in here. So let me understand it. So in terms of what you're doing and your role here in this process with a couple is if, if their experiences are anything like mine, you're sort of talking to them about their sexuality in a way that may never have occurred to them to talk about. It, it may feel right. 

00:23:45
ESTHER PEREL That's right. 

00:23:45
RICH SIMON And respond. 

00:23:45
ESTHER PEREL That's right. 

00:23:45
RICH SIMON And they have a sense of, of boy she's really getting at something. I imagine that could be for some people scary, very illuminating for other people. So what is, but in terms that your therapeutic impact, what is it, all of this is fascinating, interesting and very, you're exploring in, in a very uh, um, innovative way in, in, as I'm listening to you. But uh, how do people take this in? What's the, what are you trying to accomplish therapeutically uh, as in, as you're talking uh, in the, in something like the way you've just been um, described in this case? 

00:24:25
ESTHER PEREL Three things in this example, the first one is for the first time the conversation goes away from you never want you always want. You take the. 

00:24:35
RICH SIMON You change, you're changing the conversation? 

00:24:40
ESTHER PEREL Completely. 

00:24:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:24:40
ESTHER PEREL You're talking a whole other level. 

00:24:40
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. 

00:24:40
ESTHER PEREL Two, you take it to what the sex mean to you, not what do you want to do. Sex isn't something we do it's a place we go inside ourselves, or with another, or others. What's the journey, what's the trip, what's the voyage inside of you and with your partner that you've been deprived of. And that is often a voyage of intimacy and connection. And therefore, three you depolarize the notion that he wants sex and she wants intimacy. 

00:25:10
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:25:10
ESTHER PEREL You basically say there are different languages to intimacy. And if intimacy is going to be paramount we better be bilingual. And that means the language of the body is no less a language of intimacy and "talk". 

00:25:25
RICH SIMON Okay, so now, when you. Now how do people respond to this idea. This is not a common idea in our culture that there's this meaning to sexuality. And it's a journey of as you say, meaning. So, especially with, when, with, when you begin to talk about this with men do they get this immediately? 

00:25:45
ESTHER PEREL Yes. 

00:25:45
RICH SIMON Do you have to translate this? 

00:25:45
ESTHER PEREL No. 

00:25:45
RICH SIMON Tell, tell us a little bit about how your clients respond to you when you begin to talk in this way. 

00:25:55
ESTHER PEREL I think the most common response is, "she gets it." For the first time somebody. 

00:26:00
RICH SIMON Somebody gets it. 

00:26:00
ESTHER PEREL Putting it in words to something they have often felt. 

00:26:05
RICH SIMON But they've never put into words themselves? 

00:26:05
ESTHER PEREL No. They've experienced it, they've expressed it but they haven't translated it and basically what I do is I translate. 

00:26:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:26:15
ESTHER PEREL And then I look for the common language between the two. And I say it sounds different, it looks different, but it actually aim at the same thing you are talking about. It's just that you really need to be bilingual here. The body is the language of intimacy and you know, if I do this it means something. If I do that it means something. It express something. That's what I mean by meaning. 

00:26:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:26:40
ESTHER PEREL It, it, it, it translates something. If I do this or this I'm saying things with that, you know. And this body's in place. We all know, we're control might's. Very interesting our field is perfectly able to talk about the body and pain but it doesn't really talk much about body and place. 

00:27:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:27:00
ESTHER PEREL Many men will use the body as the place, as the language to express certain feelings that are society does not allow men to speak about with words. But the feelings go. 

00:27:15
RICH SIMON Okay, so let's. 

00:27:15
ESTHER PEREL Don't go away, they get translated in a sexual language. 

00:27:15
RICH SIMON Okay, so let me slow you down for a second or so. When you're having this conversations one thing to have the conversation when the guy and, and his wife are in the room with you. 

00:27:25
ESTHER PEREL Mm-hmm. 

00:27:25
RICH SIMON And you're translating this, and this is their language that they may not, they may not know they're saying this. But you're putting this into words. Now what is it like for you as you're the woman in the room having this very intimate conversation about sexuality and you get it. And no other woman, no other human being but maybe especially no other um, women has ever gotten that. How does that, how does that change the conversation with the client. 

00:27:55
ESTHER PEREL If I'm alone with him, I will say if I can get it now maybe your partner needs to get it. How can you bring that thing you've just understood home? 

00:28:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:28:10
ESTHER PEREL I'm a conduit. This is not. 

00:28:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:28:10
ESTHER PEREL You know, the fact that somebody got it and you now are able to express, can you bring this new found, this inside, if you want, this new understanding, this different way of looking at self. 

00:28:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:28:20
ESTHER PEREL Of understanding why you've been, you know, pounding at her like that. Can you, you know, can you bring this home differently. I'll give you an example of just the hour before now. 

00:28:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:28:30
ESTHER PEREL If the woman is in the case it's a woman partner is the room then I will say, I will ask her, you know, tell me what you, what does this little lens I just opened up. How do you see him through that lens? 

00:28:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:28:45
ESTHER PEREL And I bring it back into the relationship. I instantly put myself back down and I, in order to elevate the, the partner. 

00:28:55
RICH SIMON Good, sure. 

00:28:55
ESTHER PEREL So you don't stay in the erotic transference of this. 

00:29:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:29:00
ESTHER PEREL Person gets it and my own partner does not. 

00:29:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:29:05
ESTHER PEREL Because I didn't get it about myself necessarily either. I did a little exercise with this couple. 

00:29:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:29:10
ESTHER PEREL Just before. 

00:29:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:29:10
ESTHER PEREL And it was like, so basically I, it's an exercise that Stan Paxton uses as well, in a very different context. So, two people are standing, uh, in one side of my office and the other. 

00:29:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:29:20
ESTHER PEREL And one person is inviting the other to come toward them. But they cannot speak, they can only uh, gesture or smile, or communicate. Whatever it is they want to do. And the other person may, will choose if they want to come, how much, how soon, and how far. 

00:29:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:29:45
ESTHER PEREL And so you, it's, it's actually you, I'm using it as an exercise, even as a diagnostic tool on the narrative on desiring that couple. But in this case, what started to happen is that, you know, as she invited him, no. I meant going reverse, as he invited her, she instantly saw that he felt bad when she didn't respond immediately. And so she didn't want him to feel bad and so she came toward him to make him feel better. And all of this was super loving but that's exactly what their sexual history has been together for 14 years. 

00:30:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:30:25
ESTHER PEREL It's been her feeling bad for him not feeling good about himself, but actually never really experiencing his desire from him toward her as a woman. So she feels very mothering. And then when it went in reverse and he, she was inviting him he, I mean this, they didn't wait two minutes to put, to come together. And every time she would do something he would want more. Like she wasn't doing enough, you know. Like she was, she was doing this and he would say, yes but you're not you know, can you add something. Correcting her. Never good enough, you know. And 

00:31:05
RICH SIMON And, and does this, and, and so this in their actions, in their sexual relationship. 

00:31:10
ESTHER PEREL This is what has happened to their bed for quite a date. 

00:31:15
RICH SIMON This, this is what's happening or this is the unstated, that he would if he could he would say this. 

00:31:20
ESTHER PEREL No. 

00:31:20
RICH SIMON But he doesn't. Or is this already what's happened? Okay. 

00:31:20
ESTHER PEREL This is what happens. So he's constantly wanting more. And she's constantly making sure that he doesn't feel bad. And that is. 

00:31:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:31:30
ESTHER PEREL Not a good formula for, a adult erotic relationship. That is, one time she's the little girl, one time he's the little boy, and each of them find their perfect parents but it's not an adult relationship. And it, the beauty of it was that it just came. And then I said to him, "You know, you're not inviting her. You're not saying to her I want you. You're saying to her why don't you want me." That's not an invitation. Do you ever flirt with your wife? And, you know, and then I, I said, you know, flirting it's the French word [non-English narration], the tip of the sword. 

00:32:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:32:05
ESTHER PEREL It's teasing, it's about playing. It's about. 

00:32:10
RICH SIMON I, I didn't know what the tip of the sword, thank you. 

00:32:10
ESTHER PEREL Yes. [non-English narration] is the tip of the sword. 

00:32:15
RICH SIMON Okay. All right. 

00:32:15
ESTHER PEREL And it's about that, you know. And that means you create a little bit of frustration to create a lot of anticipation. 

00:32:20
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:32:20
ESTHER PEREL So that you build a certain charge. But you're like, you are not in desire towards your wife. You are needing your wife and when you need her she'll take care of you like she takes care of her other three boys. It's a different experience. 

00:32:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:32:35
ESTHER PEREL And she says I already have three children I want, I don't want another one. I mean that is the sentence you will often hear because she, he does not come from the place of the man. He comes to her from the place of the little boy. But in the dance, in this little exercise physically with their bodies and their faces it was all right there. So, all I said to them is, "What did you experience?" What was it like to invite? What was it like to be invited? Did you feel invited? Did you want to go? Why didn't you go? What made you move? And the entire breakdown of their erotic relationship was actually described on the spot. So I, all I had to say is, I think you're seeing it perfectly clear. Now how do we help you step out of this role? 

00:33:20
RICH SIMON Okay. Yeah. 

00:33:20
ESTHER PEREL I don't have to be a lecturer. I just set it up and I say, you know I noticed, look did you see his face at that moment. What did you read on his face in that moment when? And you know she said that for like. Okay, for, that is a different invitation. That is not an adult invitation. 

00:33:40
RICH SIMON So, so, the, the right uh, the connection in, in, that occurs to me is the that the this enormous influence that pornography has had in our culture. Especially over the last 15, 20 years is, that in some ways pornography gives the language to sexual (crosstalk) in the way that you're uh, giving a language to, it has a, there's, there's a meaning to this, these encoded impulses that the, that someone uh, that we experience sexually. And pornography is a certain kind of language. Uh, and increasingly if you, when you talk to couples therapists, and we did an interesting issue not so long ago about pornography. A lot of, more and more of uh, couples are coming in and the issue is their sexuality is very dominate or the male sexuality is dominated by the their more engaged with porn than they are with, with their wives. And uh, and then so. 

00:34:45
ESTHER PEREL And you know. 

00:34:45
RICH SIMON But you have a different take on it. 

00:34:45
ESTHER PEREL (crosstalk) that are reading. 

00:34:50
RICH SIMON On, on, on porn. So why don't you talk to us a little bit, your understanding about what's, what's going on and the, and how you deal with a couple coming in talking where the issue emerges that, that their sexuality with each other is nill and the guys are involved with. 

00:35:05
ESTHER PEREL Right. 

00:35:05
RICH SIMON With computer and his porn. 

00:35:05
ESTHER PEREL So if I see the man alone I will, and I talk about their sexuality. I automatically ask do you watch porn? What kind of porn do you watch? 

00:35:15
RICH SIMON So you'll, you'll just bring, bring it, bring it up whether he's? 

00:35:20
ESTHER PEREL Yes. 

00:35:20
RICH SIMON Bringing it up or not. You just ask. 

00:35:20
ESTHER PEREL Oh, yes. Oh yes. I, uh, so basically I'm also making the statement I've heard a lot. I haven't heard it all but I've heard a lot. You can talk to me. This is a safe place. I can handle it. I'm not judging. I can talk about porn without instantly having the word addiction attached to it. I understand that there is a healthy use of porn, you know. I understand that nobody's making a huge campaign about 50 Shades of Grey, as an outrage of women's porn. Which it is. Um, so I look at the double standard of that and I just say what do you watch? How often do watch? In what way do you use it? Do you watch alone? Does your partner watch with you? In a gay couple the issue of porn is not seen as he's having sex with another man. It's very clear that he's masturbating. In a straight couple I have to translate, no he's not having sex with another woman he's masturbating. 

00:36:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:36:15
ESTHER PEREL That is a clear distinction between you know, it's unheard of for me to hear a gay couple where one guy or both guys, both men, you know, watch porn where the other person feels betrayed by the other person watching porn. It's clear that this is their private sexual realm in which they go and they masturbate and they use porn to masturbate. 

00:36:35
RICH SIMON So when you say that, this, your husband isn't having sex with another woman he's masturbating. That means, what is it that you're saying to the wife. You're reassuring her? 

00:36:45
ESTHER PEREL I don't necessarily say it like this. I will say to him what do you use for porn for? Is it, is it, uh, you masturbate is it, you know. I mean no, it would be weird to watch porn not to masturbate then there would be concerns. I'm not concerned if you watch porn to masturbate that's the purpose of it. 

00:37:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:37:05
ESTHER PEREL Okay. And then I will ask her what's your take on porn? Do you watch porn as well? Are you in to it, not into it? 

00:37:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:37:10
ESTHER PEREL What are you in to? 

00:37:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:37:10
ESTHER PEREL Um, do you like to watch it together? Yes, I would like to watch it together but he only wants to watch it alone, he doesn't want to do it with me. How come? I don't know in advance what the, in this case, the case of the woman what her stance is on the subject of porn. 

00:37:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:37:25
ESTHER PEREL But I will at some point say to him what does porn offer you that it harder for you with a partner; if anything. Is it important for you that you get to control the whole experience? 

00:37:40
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:37:40
ESTHER PEREL Is it important for you, I mean the main thing that men will often talk about, about porn is that the woman on the other side wants and likes sex. Which is often the piece they do not experience from their partner. Now that doesn't mean that they haven't had something to do with it. But the thing is not, you know, about, you know, the women on the screen are something that I am no longer. Um, what excites is not the size of the particular body part per say, what excites is the person there who likes her body, who doesn't say I gained weight, I'm fat, I'm old, I'm wrinkled. And who is into it and doesn't make him feel a predator or dirty or lustful or guilty for imposing this dirty wishful uh, experiences on his partner. That's the main thing that porn offers. A place for control, a place where you're never in adequate, high intensity, low emotion. A place where you don't have to fear your rejection. Where you don't have to fear not pleasing the other partner. 

00:38:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:38:45
ESTHER PEREL Etc., etc. And then I say my god, how much is male sexuality relational. Now how is all of that going on with your wife? Is there something between you and your wife that gets taken cared of in your experience with porn? The general tendency and Marty Kline talks about that very nicely is to see porn as the culprit for the disconnect in the couple. 

00:39:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:39:10
ESTHER PEREL Rather than to see the disconnect in the couple as facilitating porn being a place where people will experience something more positive than what they could have with their partner. 

00:39:20
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:39:20
ESTHER PEREL And so the question that he invites us to ask is what is it that you get to experience in porn that would make not, that would make you want to do it in porn versus with a partner? 

00:39:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:39:35
ESTHER PEREL Cuz generally if it's satisfying with a partner we probably would enjoy it there too. The question about porn is also to what extent has the partner been completely excluded and the, the man's entire sexual life is just in porn. And to what extent is love online or sex online. To what extent is the, the camera or a person speaking back to you on the other side. I think there's a whole range of gradation of what the world of virtuality is about today. What does it mean when your fantasy can appear on the screen? 

00:40:10
RICH SIMON Instantly, yeah. 

00:40:10
ESTHER PEREL Instantly. And for many people porn is a place where you will find a community of people who have the same sexual preferences as you. Which often you haven't wanted to impose on your partner for that matter. So, my stance is exploratory. I ask. 

00:40:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:40:25
ESTHER PEREL For all of the points I just made I will ask. 

00:40:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:40:30
ESTHER PEREL I will say, is there anything in particular that you, you are able to experience that your wife doesn't know about or that you won't bring to her? 

00:40:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:40:40
ESTHER PEREL Or that you've tried to bring to her and she wasn't available to or interested in? Is the issue the fact that you're masturbating or is the issue the fact that you're masturbating to moving pictures? What is it that you think is bothering her? Do you think she masturbates? Do you think she reads things or does things that turn her on, that excite her, that, that wet her appetite? And what is it? 

00:41:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:41:05
ESTHER PEREL And that's where the 50 shades has become extremely powerful because it is so. 

00:41:10
RICH SIMON Now. 

00:41:10
ESTHER PEREL Illiterate, that it actually for fir-, for first time creates an even playing field. There's porn on both sides. 

00:41:15
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) So now, so where, so there's are all wonderful questions and, and fascinating um, uh, I don't think many people articulate their sexual lives and, and needs with the kind of uh, precession that you, you are encourage your clients, inviting your clients to do. So, what's the, in terms of change, in terms of the process. So you've asked these questions. You bring up the whole possibility that there's a whole other meaning to people's sexuality that for most people I would assume they haven't even considered the possibility that things can be put into language uh, in the way you do. So once you've done that is it, wha-, what, what, is that the therapy? Where does it go from there? Can you give us, a kind of sense. 

00:42:10
ESTHER PEREL Right. 

00:42:10
RICH SIMON Of where, what's the process and in terms of the way they, you work how do you help with your, your male clients as individual clients and couples on this journey? What is that? Where is this journey from where to where? 

00:42:25
ESTHER PEREL Right. So uh, I'll give you two, two uh, examples, uh, two parts to the answer. 

00:42:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:42:30
ESTHER PEREL I think the first point for me is to help people create rich multilayered meaningful conversations about their life. And if this is the aspect of their life that they are discussing I want to show them how rich a conversation about sexuality can be and how intimate. When you really are invited into the sexual neighborhoods of your partner. 

00:42:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:42:55
ESTHER PEREL It's an intimacy that is much deeper than actually having sex together. 

00:43:00
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:43:00
ESTHER PEREL It's really to enter the, the erotic mind and the erotic interiority, internal life of your partner. That is unique, you don't invite many people there. Not even your best friends. 

00:43:10
RICH SIMON So that seems very important. That's, that's a very. 

00:43:15
ESTHER PEREL So that's really intimate. 

00:43:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. Mm-hmm. 

00:43:15
ESTHER PEREL It's, it's understanding the you know, and most people don't know to talk about sex. 

00:43:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:43:20
ESTHER PEREL Many men don't talk about sex. They've lied about it and certainly we've mostly have learned to be silent about it and so it's kind of difficult to suddenly want to talk about it with the person you love. You know, in this country sex is dirty, save it for the one you love. 

00:43:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:43:35
ESTHER PEREL So, um, it's kind of, it, it. 

00:43:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:43:40
ESTHER PEREL There's a reason there is so much shame attached to it. You know, if everybody fantasized about a bed of roses we wouldn't have a problem talking about our fantasies. 

00:43:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:43:45
ESTHER PEREL But we go to other places. That's the first thing then I don't ask people do you have sex, how often, how frequent, how hard, how manly, you know. It's not about what is measurable. It's really. 

00:44:00
RICH SIMON About behavior. 

00:44:05
ESTHER PEREL No. And it's not about perfect-, perfect performance industry. It's really about the experience of it, of pleasure and connection. Connection to yourself. 

00:44:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:44:15
ESTHER PEREL And connection to a partner or more. 

00:44:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:44:15
ESTHER PEREL But it is those two dimensions about relationship with self and relationship with other as we can do through sexuality. And so then I say what do you want sex to provide to you, what do you like to experience in sex? Is sex a place where you go to experience a sense of freedom? Is sex a place where you go to experience a sense of union and transcendence? Is a place that you go in order to feel outside of yourself and kind of beyond the boundaries of your body? Is sex a place where you go to experience aggression safely and power, and control, and assertiveness? Is sex a place where you go where you can abdicate all responsibility and decision making and somebody's going to take care of you? Where do you go in sex? 

00:45:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:45:00
ESTHER PEREL What do you want sex to provide to you? We ask that question for just about any other part of our life. 

00:45:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:45:05
ESTHER PEREL It's the same question you ask about a person's profession you ask about their sexuality. And sex doesn't have social class. I mean it has lots of class influences but it's free. It's not a thing that is only reserved for the [non-English narration]. So, that's the question about the meaning. The experience of it you know, the expression of it, what do you express and how do you express it. Can you give, can you ask, can you receive, can you feel worthy of somebody actually being present for you in that way and wanting to give you all that attention? You can't have a good experience if you don't feel a sense of healthy entitlement and self worth. So, sexuality is really linked to the core of our sense of who we are and our sense of being. And that's why it connects to shame and all of that. Then the guy whom I did this exercise, this coming forward. 

00:45:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:46:00
ESTHER PEREL I said to him, you know, uh, I said to her, "So much of your response immediately is always no." No, he's the person who has a strong personality. You're dad was a person who had no say about nothing, nothing. You found a strong guy with lots of personality and now you complain that he's suffocating you and he's all over you, and he takes up all the space in the house. And the only space you have is to say no. And one of the big no's is no to sex, the power of refusal. So I say to him, "Okay, it's you know, it's understandable that you are going to need to step back." 

00:46:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:46:35
ESTHER PEREL But stepping back is not enough. So they have the weekend and during that weekend she goes into her studio do stats and do her work. And he goes on a walk and basically spends the weekend by himself walking in touch with something very, kind of lonely. You know, a sense of uh, um, restlessness and realizing that he's often turned to her and the relationship to quiet him, to anchor him, and to nurture him. And that when she's not available to do this for him, remember we mix, he mixes his desire and needs caretaking, and sex. 

00:47:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:47:10
ESTHER PEREL In that way. He's uh, uh, like that. So he's manages to breathe through it, makes phone calls to his friends, and when at the end of the weekend she's back home. She comes home every day but they connect. And she says, you know, "Should we go have a crazy drink?" And you know, basically the message is, I'm, I'm in a mood to kind of put myself in the mood basically. I'm in a mood to feel good, to feel relaxed, too. 

00:47:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:47:35
ESTHER PEREL To let loose. She basically came to him. And she came to him from a place where she owns her own desires. So it wasn't just his stepping back. I think what often happens in the therapies is we tend to tell the pursuer step back. 

00:47:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:47:50
ESTHER PEREL And we don't tell the other person, now that you've got nobody breathing down your throat, you need to own this. And you need to find a way to connect to your own desires because if you don't connect to your own erotic self, in this case lady, he can step back as much he wants. You ain't going to come toward him. And then at some point he's gonna come back and he's gonna say, I waited two weeks, three weeks, one month nothing happens. 

00:48:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:48:20
ESTHER PEREL He's going to experience his self as more guilty than selfish, and more lonely than predatory. That's a reframe if you want. 

00:48:25
RICH SIMON So, so let me stop you for second. Just so, to make sure I'm tracking where we're going with this. So it seems to me that you're inviting people to have a kind of conversation that may never have even occurred to them. They haven't heard it before,[00:48:45 ] they haven't had it, they haven't seen it in a porn movie, they haven't seen it any, anywhere. I don't know if they've seen it, I don't know 50 Shades of Grey, but where ever, whatever it is. So you're inviting this man to have a different kind of conversation where you're taking all this excitement, all this encoded physical, all the charge that we, of, of sexuality and attraction, and so on. And I'm curious about some people with take that and run with it and some people. So in terms of your experience as a therapist, and some people would say, either I don't get it or I'm not sure, I think I get it. I don't want to go there. Is in terms of grouping your experience, your inviting people into it seems to me at least in the world I live in, an unusual kind of very articulate experience of translating one kind of experience, sexuality into this thing. You share, you describe it, you, you uh, you put it in relationship terms, you, uh, uh, assign, you assign meaning or you discover meaning and share it with your partner. So in terms of of it, as you stand back from your experience as a therapist, I would assume you get different kinds of response of course, but you're gonna group it in some way for us to give us a sense of how people respond to you in this invitation that you're offering. Because it's just an invitation. 

00:50:15
ESTHER PEREL I think. 

00:50:15
RICH SIMON What do you get? 

00:50:15
ESTHER PEREL I, look, I get most of them debt, maturity, a real sense that there are two adults relating to each other as adults; two men, two women, you know. 

00:50:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:50:35
ESTHER PEREL Um, a, a level of being seen. When you are seen. 

00:50:40
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:50:40
ESTHER PEREL That place. 

00:50:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:50:40
ESTHER PEREL When you are known from that place. 

00:50:45
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:50:45
ESTHER PEREL When you are accepted. 

00:50:45
RICH SIMON You're, you're really know. 

00:50:45
ESTHER PEREL In that place you are going really deep. And it's a place. 

00:50:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:50:50
ESTHER PEREL That and it makes the relationship unique and deeply intimate because there's not many other people, even if you're not a monogamous couple, there are one or two others. I mean how many people will get that truth of you. 

00:51:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:51:05
ESTHER PEREL You get to share a part of you. And the reason it's adult is because it is a part of you that your parents will never know. 

00:51:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:51:15
ESTHER PEREL So it helps the couple distinguish itself from their relationship with their primary caregivers or parents. It helps the couple become an adult couple that experiences togetherness and separateness. That experiences erotic intimacy from the place where sexuality is a field. In which people will bring some of the deepest parts of them self, their deepest wishes, they're more persistent needs, their greatest fears, the challenges of their childhood. It all manifest in their sexuality and in their sexual fantasy. It has a truth that is very hard to get at otherwise. And as well the nonpolished part of it. Not just the lights, you know, sexuality has a light and a darker side. We're not just talking about the lighter side. 

00:52:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:52:05
ESTHER PEREL We're also talking about the darker side; jealousy, possessiveness, aggression, infantile wishes. Stuff that isn't proper necessarily but you know, by the responsible citizen. And. 

00:52:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:52:20
ESTHER PEREL You have a level of invitation into the depth of me that um, is utterly moving. And people when they go there, it's very rare that people will not want to go there. Because it's compare. 

00:52:35
RICH SIMON That's my question! You, you find in your experience that once you've, I don't think again, correct me here. You're, you're, you're practicing in uh, in Manhattan and lower Manhattans so it may be a different uh, world. And you have your, a certain culture of your clients. But for most people they're, they didn't think that that's what they were signing up for. Even in couples therapy, even in uh, sex therapy they're thinking they're there for performance, they're there for, to find out if they can have a compatibility. I want this, she wants that. I uh, we'll talk about different kinds of ways in which they might wanna have sex. But, but this kind of very, this articulation of desire and meaning is, is, is do you think. I guess my question is do people, is, is, are people aware that, that's what they're looking for when they come into your office? 

00:53:30
ESTHER PEREL No, no. And I'm going to apologize one split second because I've got charge. 

00:53:35
RICH SIMON Okay. Okay. 

00:53:45
[sil.] 

00:53:45
ESTHER PEREL I'm awfully sorry. I just realized I didn't have a charger. Um, look, I translate back, I translate. I don't you know, it's, I look at it as a language. I look at it as a metaphor. I don't just, I don't look at it as an activity that two people do in a bed. 

00:54:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:54:25
ESTHER PEREL I look at it as, as, as an language in which people express themselves. So once that is understood um, I don't have a downtown Manhattan practice. I travel to countries every month and I work with people from all backgrounds. I also have people from 15 different countries in my office. 

00:54:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:54:45
ESTHER PEREL Because it's multilingual. So, I, I don't think the people in, you know, I, I have tapes of couples in their 60s or 70s, um in Argentina. I mean I have loads of different ages and different range. 

00:55:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:55:00
ESTHER PEREL I think when it comes to men the majority of research that we have about male sexuality is from college students, for example. 

00:55:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:55:05
ESTHER PEREL It's not from older men. And I think. 

00:55:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:55:10
ESTHER PEREL The, the older we are as therapist and the older our population of clients and the older we seem to be living we are discovering a whole new range of decades of sexual lives that people are having from which there is a lot to learn. There are seven times more studies about women's sexual desire than about male sexual desire. Why have studies. 

00:55:30
RICH SIMON Really? 

00:55:30
ESTHER PEREL About something. 

00:55:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:55:30
ESTHER PEREL That men are not suppose to have anyway. 

00:55:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:55:30
ESTHER PEREL Which is not the case. Um, we see in our offices more and more men with a crisis of desire. And porn isn't the problem. The crisis of desire is a problem and why are they having that crisis? What is it about the way they experience their partner and themselves in relationships that make porn become a more um, favorable option for them? 

00:55:55
RICH SIMON Okay. So, so we have 

00:55:55
ESTHER PEREL That kind of thing. 

00:55:55
RICH SIMON We, we have about five more minutes here. So, let's take her down the home stretch here. So, as, so you're describing a certain kind of journey of meanings, of taking sexuality not as a distinct activity in life but expression of what it is that we're looking for in our relationships with each other. You're helping people put a language to that and to be able to talk about things that they otherwise, they, they don't. Maybe they never even imagined that they could and they're discovering, you, literally they're learning it would seem to me often a new language. Now, so these, uh, and when you go to the later stages of the journey, what is, what does it look like? So the people who stick with you, I imagine some people, this isn't for them. They get threatened or they whatever it is, it's too intimate, whatever part of your practice that is. Let's leave that aside for a moment. But the people, so the people who um, stay with this how would you describe, what is their, what's their relationship, what is, how is their sexuality become transformed? What is, what, how would you or is it, or is it transformed? Just what do you see? 

00:57:15
ESTHER PEREL I will ask for example, what's a dilemma that you face at this point in relation to your sexuality? That's a whole different question than blame, attack, you'll reject me, you want me, you don't want me. Now we are owning. Sexuality is a property of self, right. Yes. Once we have contraception it no longer is just in the sole world of biology. It's part of our self definition. What's a dilemma that you face of you sexuality at this point in your life? What is a barrier that you would like to cross? What is something with your partner that you have wanted to experience and have not? What are aspects of your sexuality that you value and that you would like to maintain? And what are experiences that you still would like to have? 

00:58:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:58:00
ESTHER PEREL My favorite one is, you know, your best sexual experience has it, has it already happened or is it still to come? 

00:58:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:58:10
ESTHER PEREL Cuz you don't know. 

00:58:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:58:10
ESTHER PEREL A fad, depending on the answer. 

00:58:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:58:15
ESTHER PEREL Um, what has changed for you sexually as you age? You know, what's your relationship to your body? You know, would you make love to yourself? If you don't want to make love to yourself why do you expect to your partner would want to make love to you, you know? 

00:58:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:58:30
ESTHER PEREL Um, what, what, what are the messages that you grew up with around men, who, about femininity, about power, about flirtation, about receiving, about getting pleasure, etc.? What tradition do you come from? Religiously, culturally, and familial? 

00:58:45
RICH SIMON So okay, all these seem, seem great questions but I'm, I'm asking about we're, I'm trying to move us along. Since we don't have much time to. So, what is when you, when you um, talk to people, I don't know if you do exit interviews or you talk to people after they've been in therapy with you. You did a wonderful piece for us last year about affairs, kind of a retrospective of people who've, who've gone through the crisis of uh, having an affair and describing the different sorts of it, of relationships of people develop in the aftermath of an affair. So what is the, do people have these wonderful conversations of meaning ongoingly in their sex life? 

00:59:30
ESTHER PEREL It's not just meaningly. 

00:59:30
RICH SIMON Is their behavior very different? Just some, I'm trying to get some idea of. 

00:59:30
ESTHER PEREL Their whole life is different. 

00:59:35
RICH SIMON Where this goes. 

00:59:35
ESTHER PEREL Their life, their life changes, you know. 

00:59:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:59:35
ESTHER PEREL Basically we used to think that sexual problems if you take couples. 

00:59:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:59:40
ESTHER PEREL We used to think that sexual problems are the consequences of relationship problems. 

00:59:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:59:45
ESTHER PEREL And so we've always have said fix the relationship and the sex will follow. 

00:59:50
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:59:50
ESTHER PEREL And we have as a couple's therapy field developed a practice that is a rather desexualized practice. America is a sex negative culture but psychotherapy is not much more positive. 

01:00:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:00:05
ESTHER PEREL And couple's therapy is really remarkably capable of training you for hundreds of hours in couple's therapy without any thing about sexuality. 

01:00:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:00:10
ESTHER PEREL Which is bizarre. 

01:00:10
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

01:00:15
ESTHER PEREL Compared to sex therapy has very little to say about relationships because it's been taken over by the medicalization of sexuality and all of that. 

01:00:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:00:20
ESTHER PEREL So there a few people who are trying to bridge, David Snardz(ph) being one of the main ones. Michelle Menna Davis, Pat Love, there are a few in our circle here that precede me, you know. 

01:00:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:00:30
ESTHER PEREL But what you get at the end of that exploration is basically on the other end when a person's relationship to their sexuality changes. 

01:00:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:00:40
ESTHER PEREL It changes their entire self. Their entire life, their entire relationship because if you understand that sexuality is about self worth, self-esteem, communication, awareness, self acceptance, acceptance of another, deeper truths, pleasure, giving, receiving. When that changed through sex your life is changed and your relationship is changed. So the exit is people who have a completely different relationship with themselves, with their sense of giving, receiving, deserving that they matter, that they matter in love. That somebody would want them to feel good. That they matter enough that they want to feel good. That they're not in self negation, that there is, you know, are in pain, or in frustration or in trauma, or in abuse, or any of the legacies that sexuality can often have. You liberate people sexually, you give them power in the world. Everyone understands that on a political level it's true in therapy as well. 

01:01:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:01:45
ESTHER PEREL We know that the politics of sex are in, in Washington every day. So we understand that sex is politics. If you liberate a person on the individual level, sexually, if you help them free themselves from whatever the shackles are they are struggling with. 

01:02:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:02:00
ESTHER PEREL You are giving them a different presence in the world and in their intimate life with their partner. As a couple's therapist to me that's a big accomplishment. 

01:02:10
RICH SIMON And a, and a great place to uh, to punctuate this conversation which I, I'm sure we'll continue uh, after our, our part of it has. So, um. 

01:02:20
ESTHER PEREL Is that a good response? Is that a clear response? 

01:02:25
RICH SIMON So, so, it's uh, it's uh, it's a lovely response. Very inspiring and there's a you know, uh, as you're describing there's a sense of a kind of a wholeness in, in rather than sexuality as that private thing that's cut off, that we don't talk about it, that is shrouded in shame and that's secret and this is, this is true for men. I don't know if it's especially true but certainly. So you're saying what you, what you're through, what you're modeling and the kind of conversation you're inviting is to embrace our sexualities as part of us. That's something that can be put into language. 

01:03:00
ESTHER PEREL Right. 

01:03:00
RICH SIMON That comes right up there. That's, that's. 

01:03:00
ESTHER PEREL And that's not genital or you know, a thing that lasts 10 minutes with 5 minutes of foreplay before the real thing. And the real thing is intercourse and it ends with orgasm. You know. 

01:03:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

01:03:10
ESTHER PEREL Sexuality is it's, it's a religious experience, it's a extension experience, it's a relational experience, it's a lot of things. And when you reduce it to an act. 

01:03:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

01:03:25
ESTHER PEREL People have done this act for centuries and solved nothing. 

01:03:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

01:03:25
ESTHER PEREL Men and women. 

01:03:25
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. So, well put. So now, and, and I'm, I imagine many people listening to this will want to find out more your work, things they can read, opportunities for trainings where, where do they go?
