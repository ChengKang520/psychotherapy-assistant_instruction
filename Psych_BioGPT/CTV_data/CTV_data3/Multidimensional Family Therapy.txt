Liddle, EdD., ABPP (Family Psychology) is the Director of the Center for Treatment Research on Adolescent Drug Abuse, and Professor of Public Health Sciences and Psychology at the University of Miami School of Medicine. Dr. Liddle is the developer of Multidimensional Family Therapy 

00:00:25
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Hello and welcome to this presentation on multidimensional family therapy, MDFT. This video presents the main features of MDFT and demonstrates the approach through my work with a single-parent mother and her 16-year-old son. The adolescent was refer to treatment by the local Juvenile Justice Authority. 

00:00:45
Conceptualize and intervene with a developmental and contextual orientation 

00:00:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Adolescent substance abuse and related behavior problems are best understood developmentally and contextually not simply in terms of individual or even family only factors. Addressing complex clinical situations by treating just one aspect of the teenager's life can yield poor outcomes, wasted resources, frustrated families, exasperated clinicians and suffocating despair for the adolescent. But proven alternatives are available. The research-based MDFT program for adolescent drug abuse and delinquency or for as practical guidance to clinicians and hope for families. 

00:01:25
Comprehensive and family-centered approach Targets known determinants of substance abuse and antisocial behavior 

00:01:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE MDFT is a comprehensive family-centered treatment. Drawing upon several theoretical frameworks MDFT targets key domains of the adolescent's life. It addresses areas of youth and parent functioning known to create problems and enhances the factors that solve problems, improve relationships and restore positive development. MDFT's guiding principles address the clinical complexity of adolescent, parent and family problems. Orienting therapist to be approach the principles guide assessment and intervention. They guide a therapist case conceptualization intervention design and delivery. The MDFT intervention you'll see in this video consistently reflect one or more of this principles. 

00:02:20
Guiding Principles of MDFT Drug abuse and related problems are multidimensional. Improving family functioning is critical to youth outcomes. Multiple treatment targets 

00:02:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE What are the guiding principles of the MDFT approach? Adolescent drug abuse and related problems are multidimensional phenomenon. MDFT takes in to account social, emotional, cognitive, familial, developmental and context factors. These factors contribute to the continuation worsening and chronicity of drug and other behavior problems. Family functioning is instrumental in creating developmentally adaptive lifestyle alternatives for teenagers. The adolescent's day to day family environment offers numerous and immediate opportunities to retract developmental functioning. Changes multifaceted, multidetermined and stage-oriented behavioral change comes from interaction among systems and within levels of systems. It involves different domains of an individual's functioning as well as interpersonal processes. A multivariate view of the change process commits clinicians to a coordinated, sequential use of several change methods and the working of multiple change pathways. 

00:03:35
Motivation is malleable. Enhancing motivation is the therapist's job. 

00:03:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Motivation is malleable. Motivation to enter treatment or to change will not always be present with adolescent's or their parents but treatment reluctance is all trouble. Motivating teams and family members about treatment participation and about change is a fundamental therapeutic test. 

00:04:00
Multiple alliances: Therapist-adolescent, therapist-parent(s), and therapist-community at school or court. 

00:04:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Multiple therapeutic alliances has create a foundation for change. Therapist create individual working relationships with the teenager, with the parents or the caregivers and individuals in the community who are involved in the youth's life at present. 

00:04:20
Individualized interventions foster developmental competencies. 

00:04:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Individualized interventions harness family members strength to foster developmental competencies. Clinicians create opportunities to build teen and parental confidence during and between sessions. Interventions are tailored to each person and situation and customized according to the specifics of a family's history, culture and current context. 

00:04:45
3 treatment stages: (1) Build the foundation, (2) Facilitate individual family, and inter-system change, and (3) Reinforce and solidify change. 

00:04:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Treatment occurs in stages. The MDFT program overall and the given MDFT session and even MD-- interventions themselves are stage-based. Continuity, weaving together treatment components and session outcomes, facilitates the change process. 

00:05:10
Therapist responsibility is emphasized. 

00:05:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Therapist responsibility is emphasized. Therapist promote participation and enhanced motivation of all relevant persons in the adolescent's life at present. They partner with family members to create a personal and meaningful therapeutic agenda. Clinicians provide the manic focus and ensure consistency throughout treatment. Therapist facilitate the conditions that create behavior change and they also assess with the family and others in community systems the ongoing effects of interventions. Throughout the program interventions are revised, collaboratively as needed. 

00:05:50
Therapist attitude is fundamental to success. 

00:05:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Therapist attitude is fundamental to success. Therapist are not child-savers nor are they unidimensional tough love proponents. They advocate for adolescents and parents. Clinicians are hopeful and optimistic but not naive about change. They look to contextual influences to stimulate intervention success rather than as a intractable sources of problem origination or excuses for not achieving therapeutic outcomes. 

00:06:25
Structure and components of MDFT 

00:06:25
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Next, let's look at the structure and components of MDFT and how they allow for flexibility and customization. MDFT interventions are specified according to treatment stage. 

00:06:40
Core sessions specify fundamental treatment tasks within each therapy stage. 

00:06:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Core sessions offer therapist explicit yet flexible guidance in fundamental areas of work such as engagement, empowering parents and teenagers or facilitating family change. Comprehensive programming for clinical referred adolescents is where a national study of adolescent treatment programs found that only 8.6% of programs offer comprehensive services to youth. Only 22.5% of programs involve families. 

00:07:10
Interventions enhance the day to day functioning of the youth, the parent(s), the family, and the family with relevant outside people and situations. 

00:07:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE MDFT focuses on both steering the functioning and interactions across four domains, the individual adolescent, the parents, the family unit and neighborhood and community factors and we work those four domains across each of the three program stages. MDFT addresses four domains, adolescent, parent, family and community simultaneously. 

00:07:40
Change in each domain potentiates and stimulates change in the others. 

00:07:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE We coordinate the interventions and systematically use events and success in one domain to leverage and accelerate change in the others. 

00:07:50
Stage 1 - Build a foundation and begin change. 

00:07:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Stage one, builds a foundation for and begins the change process. We created environment where both the youth and parents feel understood and respected depending on a sessions goals therapist meet alone with the teenager alone with the parents or with the family together. Treatment intensity is flexible. It varies according to need. Sessions are conducted from one to four times per week over 4 to 6 months in the home, in the clinic or both. Phone calls and text messages are used every week. Primary goals include developing strong therapeutic alliances, achieving a fair developmental and contextual perspective on presenting problems and enhancing everyone's motivation for frank self-examination and change. 

00:08:45
Stage 2 - Interventions and outcomes in the 4 domains activate and support change in the others. 

00:08:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Stage two, facilitates individual behavioral and family interactional change. It's in this longest stage of the program where most of action takes place. Distinctive, practical and complementary goals for youth, parent and family functioning are established. Activities and outcomes in the four domains fit together in an interrelated way. Each domain adolescent, parent, family and community is understood and treated both as a whole and as a part. Accomplishments in each of these individual domains activate and support change in the others. 

00:09:25
Aims of adolescent-focused interventions 

00:09:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Interventions with the adolescent are collaborative efforts. They help the youth rethink and examine his or her current situation. Express themselves effectively with parents and other adults. Develop coping, emotion regulation and problem-solving skills, improve social confidence and address peer relationships and all these outcomes combined to establish alternatives to substance abuse and delinquent behavior also collaborative. 

00:10:00
Aims of parent-focused interventions 

00:10:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Interventions with the parents enhanced the adults own emotional life. They increase the parents behavioral and emotion involvement with their teenager. Improve the parent-adolescent relationship, enhance diverse parenting skills including monitoring the youth's activities with peer networks. Their work also clarifies a parents expectations and help them set limits and develop practical consequences for continued problems. 

00:10:30
Aims of family-focused interventions 

00:10:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Interventions with the family typically aimed to decrease conflict. Deepen emotional attachments and improve communication and problem-solving skills. 

00:10:40
Aims of interventions in the youth's environment 

00:10:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Interventions with the community. Foster family competency and positive practical outcomes in interactions with school, legal and juvenile justice, work or other social systems. 

00:10:55
Stage 3 uses accomplishments and strengths to solidify changes 

00:10:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Stage three of the MDFT approach aims to solidify recent changes covering the last few sessions is where boisterous parent and teen changes. Concrete plans define how to respond the future problems such as substance abuse relapse, family arguments or major life setbacks. This stage reinforces strengths and competencies activated during the program such as renewed motivation and sense of purpose. The family members experience real change and see opportunities for a brighter future. They regain hope. Let's turn to the session you're about to see. The adolescent, Christian, 16 years old, smoking marijuana pretty much every day during most weeks. His marijuana use began about age 13. His school attendance is poor. Christian is just now back into school after serving a suspension for buying marijuana at school. He was referred into a program that requires drug testing, meetings with the case manager and mandatory counseling. The MDFT program is part of his legal or juvenile justice obligation after his arrest. If he completes the program successfully, passes the drug testing, attend the school regularly and meets with the juvenile justice case manager his arrest record will be sponged, wipe clean. 

00:12:30
Chapter 2 The video shows work within the 4 target domains - adolescent, parent, family, and extrafamilial across the 3 stages of MDFT. The opening two segments are initial stage individual sessions, first with the adolescent and then with his mom. The third segment is a section of the first family session. These segments show 3 keys to create a therapeutic foundation: (1) Relationships (2) Focusing and motivation (3) Expression and interchange 

00:12:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE The video show work within the four target domains - adolescent, parent, family and extrafamilial across the three stages of MDFT. The opening two segments are initial phase individual sessions, first with the adolescent and then with his mom. The third segment is a section of the first family session. These segments highlight three keys to creating a therapeutic foundation. First, relationships. Establish individual relationships with the adolescent and the mom by supporting and understanding each ones view of their circumstances. Second, focusing and motivation. Select and stay focused on particular details and the emotional reactions from the adolescent and the mom to enhance motivation and participation. Third, expression and interchange. Facilitate the moms and the sons expression of complains and concerns and shape their discussion to sharpen relationship themes with examples of importance for each. 

00:13:45
Christian calls the clinic to say he's not going to keep his appointment 

00:13:50
CHRISTIAN Hey, this is Christian. I, ah, I know I had an appointment today but I think I won't be able to make it. Bye. 

00:14:00

00:14:05
Therapist calls Christian - says "as long as you're still in the neighborhood, stick around and let me meet you today"

00:16:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE But it's, ah? 

00:16:10
CHRISTIAN - there's still a lot of-- I got been through a lot so I could go for more I think.

00:16:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I mean, I think what, what it's about is to try and find something here that we would talk about that's different from what I might talk with your mom that's just about you and just for you. For me, it's like I see your situation with, I don't know how you feel about it but there, there is stuff on the outside that feels to looks like it's like closing in a little bit. 

00:17:25
CHRISTIAN I mean, I, I don't really see it that way. I just see it it's my problem that I'll deal with it. My mom doesn't wanna help me out so I'm just doing it my way and now come here... 

00:17:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE So, so when you get... 

00:17:35

00:17:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE So let me just... 

00:17:35

What did you say to yourself? 

00:18:00
CHRISTIAN Well, that's when I was like, all right, mom probably is right. I should give it a try cuz it's gonna help me. Just go through this process, this legal process. 

00:18:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

00:18:15
CHRISTIAN But that's when I hit rough bottom and I was like, all right, I'm going to do like this might be like a down like I just wanna try something. 

00:18:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE All right. So, Christian, I mean, that really impresses me. This piece of how that, that, ah, that ah, jail thing that attention thing got your attention.

00:18:50
CHRISTIAN - my mom just got like more in trouble like my mom would be more on my, on my back like she was be more pushy wouldn't let me go out with my friends so I was just like think I'm not as good as I thought I am. 

00:19:05
HOWARD A. LIDDLE We basically try and create this team not may sound you know, weird but that's what we do.

00:24:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE We're gonna... 

00:24:55
DIANA How are you gonna stop this? 

00:24:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE We're gonna... 

00:24:55
DIANA Okay. I, I just can't handle this anymore. 

00:25:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I got it. We-- we're gonna get this guy back. 

00:25:00
DIANA He's just like his father. 

00:25:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I don't know. All right, listen. Whatever is done over there, we'll be talking about that, whatever we have to talk about over there, we'll talk about that. Today first thing I wanna tell you is, this is point number one. I met him. It was a good meeting. Ah, the, the, the kid is a-- he's, he's willing to come over here. That's a good thing. Second thing I get is like you know, up to here and beyond so there's so much in you it's bringing up the past stuff. You're, you're going 100 miles an hour. You have everything from the money to worry about to the, the, the bosses at work, here you are trying-- I know. I, I heard about this. Trying to hold on to this thing over there, okay. So in your situation it's, it's, it's a, it's a different version of what's going on. He came he-- he's got things on his back but you are responsible for him. You want different things for him. You never thought this was gonna happen. You said you raise him better than that. 

00:26:05
DIANA He's almost old. Is there a program I could just send him maybe like make him into an adult already? 

00:26:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I-- that would be... 

00:26:10
DIANA I mean, that would be the best thing for me and for this family. I'm telling you right now because I-- I'm going to end up - 

00:26:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

00:26:15
DIANA - of wringing his neck. 

00:26:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Okay. Here's the thing. I mean, ah, parents-- the, ah, families they do that over time and that, that is one thing that a parent could do that a kid, kid can put them-- put themselves out of, out of the home, out of the family. Sometimes it's the, it's the law that, ah, that comes in and says, ah, not, ah, no program is gonna work with the guy, ah, send them away. But our thing is different, ah, I as a stranger this may sound, ah, you know, in situation just like yours I'm telling you these things can turn around cuz what I get from you and what I got from him you see there's two things as there's this deep things that you're feeling and then there's maybe a little bit of gee, I wish it wasn't this way. So those are two different things. Mostly now you're feeling like this is, this is no good. I'm mad at him. I wanna wring his neck. He's, he's creating, why does this grief coming in my life? I could lose my job. I could be out of money and serious would-- and then what about this legal stuff? I mean, this is very distressing. 

00:27:25
DIANA I don't know what to think about that. 

00:27:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE The school was one thing but, but we got no-- now we got a probational pursuit too. 

00:27:30
DIANA Wait. 

00:27:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE We've got a case manager. He's gonna go see. What I'm saying, look Diana, what I'm saying he, he, he needs help with this. We gotta get... 

00:27:40
DIANA No. He just needs to keep on doing the drugs so that he could get his ass on jail. 

00:27:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah, beginning... 

00:27:45
DIANA Okay? 

00:27:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

00:27:45
DIANA That's what he needs to be doing. 

00:27:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I, I need... 

00:27:45
DIANA You know, ah, maybe he'll just, just get further into it and then get caught finally - 

00:27:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I know. 

00:27:50
DIANA - and, and then will be and then he will be sent away and then I won't have this burden anymore. 

00:27:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I know. 

00:27:55
DIANA My daughter was out of the house. I never had that problem with her, ever. 

00:28:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE What, what-- when you're talking like that what's talking? What's talking? What's, what's, what's in there? What's talking you say that? Keep use-- let him keep using, what's talking? 

00:28:15
DIANA I know I'm, I'm angry. I'm angry and overwhelmed. His dad doesn't help at all. 

00:28:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. What if I said to you, uhm, would you let me come in and you know, be a coach, be a partner, be a teammate for you and we give this thing a go? 

00:28:40
DIANA I don't even know what the go is? I don't even know what you're talking about. 

00:28:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I know. Well, for-- it's, it's start... 

00:28:45
DIANA I mean, I never had to do this before. 

00:28:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Oh, yeah, I mean, ah, I-- it's very, uhm, powerful, you know, to sit here with you. Uhm, I mean, it's really, you know, we just met and, uhm, it's not everybody that is so you know, straight-- straightforward and, and expressive. So, that, that part is really good like you're gonna say well, this is really stupid thing to say but, but it's really good that you're so like out there and clear cuz I know you're gonna say, well look, all I feel is, is, is, is frustration and disappointment and-- but on the one hand what I'm saying to you is that what-- that this way that you have of just putting everything out there is a really good thing and believe me when I tell it's go-- it's gonna come in real handy when we-- if we go down this-- down this road together. 

00:29:50
DIANA What do you mean? 

00:29:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE That, that, that this kind of thing, this program you know, a counseling thing. People think it's about information. It's, it's like I gonna give you the-- it's partly about information, it's partly about what's going on with this kids, whether what, what are these drugs about, what about these, these friends, how specifically you're gonna grip on these guys, you know, development to get-- he's, he's off the trip, this you know, and then what happen you know what you know and what you're consumed with is this frustration and anger with him, disappointment, these kind of things, okay? And it's not, it's not hard for you to, to go there and to stay there. What part of what we're-- what we would do is make it, is make it make you more, more complex in a way, in a way give you new, new things to do, new ways to deal with him. He's got to deal with you differently. He's gonna deal with his life differently. No question about it. I know, I know you-- where you think this is going. I'm not saying wrong where, where this is going. I'm agreeing with you. This is, this is a mess. This is a total mess. This guy is 16 years old. There was no way, there was no way this should be happening. Bouncing around in school, getting arrested, probation officers, this is not life. This is not what you want, what you ever wanted for him. No, we are all in agreement. What I'm saying is that we, you and me, part of this thing that we're gonna do is you and me. You... 

00:31:35
DIANA How? I just don't know what to do anymore. 

00:31:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE We're, we're gonna get there. 

00:31:35
DIANA It's on me. 

00:31:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE We're gonna get there. We're gonna get there. Well part of it is you and me, part of it is me and him and then part of it is, is all of us together. 

00:31:45
DIANA I don't know if he's going to do it. Uhm, I mean, he might because he's you know, he has the school officer and all these thing going on and - 

00:31:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uhm, this is what - 

00:31:55
DIANA - these stuff so maybe - 

00:31:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE - this is what we're gonna... 

00:31:55
DIANA - well, but I don't know. 

00:31:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE That's not the only reason he's gonna do it. The pressure that you were putting on him. He feels this. Okay, it's not working completely, maybe you're gonna say it's not working at all but listen, ah, that's a better position for you to begin and I'm gonna help, you know, get that better, get better influence process with him. We can do that and he's got a-- get this induction of role out there get the school thing, the probation thing. 

00:32:20
DIANA I think it's too late to have any influence on him. 

00:32:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Okay. What do you want for him right now? 

00:32:25
DIANA I just want him to get his act together, go to school. 

00:32:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE So go-- he's gotta go to school. 

00:32:30
DIANA He's gotta go to school. 

00:32:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE He gotta go to school. 

00:32:30
DIANA He's gonna be something of his life. 

00:32:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE What's going on around the house? How does he treated? 

00:32:35
DIANA He doesn't talk to me. He doesn't do anything with me. He, he, he just want-- he sleeps all day. He skips school. I have no control over him. I have to go to work. I mean, he doesn't help around the house. 

00:32:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE So he is... 

00:32:50
DIANA He's lazy. He just-- he's out all the time. 

00:32:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Right. 

00:32:55
DIANA And if not he's hanging out with this, this regular thugs, I'm telling you. 

00:32:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Right. And when-- and you over time, over time, well over months maybe over a long time, you bring this stuff out with him and let's say, right, I mean, met you, what he--- let's say he's sitting right there and you, and you start, you start talking about this to him. What, what goes on? 

00:33:15
DIANA He'll ignore me. 

00:33:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I know. 

00:33:15
DIANA He'll ignore me. He doesn't care what I say. 

00:33:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE And then what? You stop? 

00:33:20
DIANA No. I'm still yelling, of course. I'm frustrated. 

00:33:25
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Then he leaves the house? Where is he? 

00:33:25
DIANA Yeah. He just walk out the door. 

00:33:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Okay. That's what we're gonna change. Does it will change? 

00:33:30
DIANA And he comes home whenever he feels like it. 

00:33:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I know. That's it. 

00:33:35
DIANA Sometimes he doesn't even come home. I have no control. 

00:33:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE It's, it's-- I mean, doesn't-- it's a dangerous situation, isn't it? What, what is happening for this guy for, for this young men? 

00:33:45
DIANA I'm scared to see where he's heading. 

00:33:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE That's where-- that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. 

00:33:55
DIANA I don't that life for him. 

00:33:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE No. No. That's what I'm, that's what I'm saying and, and this is, this is why I know, I know, I know it. I know it. 

00:34:05
DIANA So what can we do? 

00:34:05
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Well, I wanna, I wanna stay with that just for a minute. I know, I'm gonna try to torture you here but, ah, I wanted to stay just here, cuz this is-- you see this, this kind of thing, this part, this part of what's going on with you, uhm, this is gonna help you. This part is gonna help you. This part is gonna help you to hold on to this part cuz all these parts of you, all these different experiences that you're having about this but this part we'll just talking about now what you just said, where is this gonna go? This is-- who, who is this we're talking about here? Who is this we're talking about? What's he's name? 

00:34:55
DIANA Christian.

00:35:00
DIANA I did. 

00:35:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE You did. Why? Why did you name him Christian? 

00:35:05
DIANA Cuz I love him so much in that naming so much. 

00:35:05
HOWARD A. LIDDLE That mean-- the naming so much. It's been a long road with him. 

00:35:10
DIANA Yeah. 

00:35:15
[sil.] 

00:35:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE This is what I'm saying that we have to-- we, we have to not let go of this part because this part of, of what you feel, of what you know, of what you know you should do, you could do, what you have to do, look, is-- I'm gonna help you with this part. I'm gonna help you to put this part of all that you feel into action. 

00:35:50
DIANA But he has to do his part too. 

00:35:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I agree with you. That's why I met with him along today. I know you feel like, man, is this thing ain't gonna turn around. This guy is to forgone. Let's send him away. What I'm saying to you is this part of you, this experience, this, this thing that you're talking about when you sit and you look at him, uhm, and you say his name, Christian, cuz you wanna say to him, Christian, what is going on? Where is this going? You're going down and I don't want this to happen. That's what you wanna say to him, I think. Diana, you are the most important medicine for him. 

00:36:45
DIANA Well, I hope I can. 

00:36:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I, I know. 

00:36:45
DIANA I feel like I'm hurting him more. I can't help it. 

00:36:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I know. There's a bit-- there's a lousy feeling. I know how strong that is and that's what I'm saying to you. I'm saying to you that you have all of these things going on and what I'm trying to do right now is just bring this other part in and make it grow. I wanted that part to grow just for now, just what you and me. We're gonna worry about him. We're gonna deal with him. You're gonna deal with him. I'm gonna deal with him. We're gonna have a meeting in school. We're gonna deal with this juvenile justice thing with the, with the pro. We're gonna deal with all of these get this drugs in a row. We're gonna deal with this. This is not okay, of course not. This is, this is just one little piece of what's going on with him. He's got to answer you what? What is that about? What? You gotta pay bills and money is gone from your purse. I'm aware. I don't even have explanation for that. I mean, with multiple times and, and I wouldn't understand it. So, I'm with you with all of that and I'm just saying one thing. Let the, let this piece today, right now, just let it be there, let this piece, ah, where you say, this is my son. What is going on?

00:38:30
DIANA What? You freaking got suspended from school. 

00:38:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Oh yeah.

HOWARD A. LIDDLE So that's, that's the thing. I mean, you, ah, do you, do you-- what you just said I mean, do you, do you think about that from time to time and where do you, where do you get that, that thing you just said? Where do you get that? 

00:38:50
CHRISTIAN I mean... 

00:38:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE That she has nowhere what-- what's going on? 

00:38:55
CHRISTIAN She's never home. She's always working. She's-- won't, won't try like we don't even try it on a beat together. We just... 

00:39:00
DIANA So who does to pay the freaking bills after your dad left. Someone had to come and be responsible and pay the bills. What are you freaking expect, huh? 

00:39:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE So she's, yes, she-- she's feeling like man you're, you're, you're out there flying on your own and you're doing your own, you're doing your own thing. 

00:39:20
CHRISTIAN I mean, I'm going out with my friends - 

00:39:25
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

00:39:25
CHRISTIAN - here and there. 

00:39:25
DIANA A bunch of losers that's who he's going out with. 

00:39:30
CHRISTIAN Well, that's the problem. She thinks I just hang out with losers. 

00:39:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

00:39:30
DIANA Yeah, you do. 

00:39:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Something... 

00:39:35
CHRISTIAN I don't, I don't understand who does she want me to hang out with - 

00:39:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

00:39:40
CHRISTIAN - the nerds, like what? 

00:39:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

00:39:40
CHRISTIAN I don't get it. 

00:39:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE So what's important to you like if you say-- somebody is you know, what's, what's, what's important in your life right now? What's, what's important to you? 

00:39:50
CHRISTIAN Very good question. To me all I'm doing is right now is this problem and that's pretty much hard to fix this and I don't know if it's gonna work out cuz my mom is never happy at me. So... 

00:40:10
DIANA We've tried already, Christian. We've tried. 

00:40:10
CHRISTIAN We went through like this counseling program. I don't really like it. She don't understand that. 

00:40:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uh-hmm. 

00:40:15
CHRISTIAN She don't understand that. 

00:40:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uh-hmm. 

00:40:15
CHRISTIAN It was very like tung-tung-tung like that. 

00:40:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

00:40:20
CHRISTIAN I just couldn't deal with her and then she's like cutting me off that I can't go out certain times. 

00:40:25
DIANA You don't listen to me anyway. 

00:40:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE You know, I, I know he's, he's fru-- he's frustrated right now. I tell you now that you're, you're, ah, you're really good that, ah, I think you're kind of a thinker. You're-- you seem like a smart guy, I mean, somebody ask you a question you know, you're very straightforward. I think that's a really good thing. I think that's gonna help us. 

00:40:50
CHRISTIAN Hopefully to fix this problem. 

00:40:55
DIANA You're the one with the problem. You need to admit that you have a problem. 

00:41:00
CHRISTIAN Which I don't think I have a problem, that's the thing. I feel like the texting would be a good first step at least. 

00:41:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Talk about that. 

00:41:10
CHRISTIAN I'll text every day where I go. Let her know that I'm going on cuz I just go out and just never let her know. In that way when she's at work she'll feel more probably I hope she feels better. 

00:41:25
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Now check it out. 

00:41:25
CHRISTIAN But... 

00:41:25
HOWARD A. LIDDLE See if it's going to try. I hear what you're saying. 

00:41:25
CHRISTIAN Do you think it's gonna work out? 

00:41:30
DIANA Listen, Christian, I worry about you day and night, okay? Day and night. So you're texting me but I have no idea who you're with or where you're at. 

00:41:40
CHRISTIAN What if I let you know? 

00:41:40
DIANA Yeah. How I know that you're telling the truth. You've already stolen from me. It's really hard to trust you now. 

00:41:45
CHRISTIAN Oh I mean, you gotta help me out too. You gotta trust me. 

00:41:50
DIANA But you lost that trust. 

00:41:50
CHRISTIAN I'm gaining it back. I don't know, do something. Let's see if that... 

00:41:55
DIANA Me? You are the one that's got the problem. I'm out they are working my ass off. 

00:42:00
CHRISTIAN I don't have a problem. 

00:42:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Well, I like, well I like where you-- I like what he stand. I know, just stay, stay with but I like what you just trying there. I like you. I thought you-- you'd understand which is nice. Looks great. You know that was great. Now tell me the truth. So what-- we can do this again. Just keep, yeah, keep going, keep going. 

00:42:20
CHRISTIAN Should I... 

00:42:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE You got at least-- hey, you got a good idea. Go ahead. 

00:42:25
CHRISTIAN Shall we try that? 

00:42:30
DIANA I'll try anything now. I don't want him in jail. So if that-- if I can get that then I guess I'd be-- I don't know, I'm still gonna worry. 

00:42:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I know you're still influential. Because you-- I, I like, I like what you think. Nice, clean, clear, very straightforward through. Let's do it. 

00:43:00
CHRISTIAN All right. 

00:43:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Okay. 

00:43:05
CHRISTIAN I'll do it. 

00:43:05
Chapter 6 Therapist and School Counselor: First Meeting So far, you've seen how MDFT works directly with the adolescent, directly with the parent, and directly on youth-parent interaction. But the fourth corner of MDFT work is vitally important as well. Here we reach out directly to build a collaborative professional relationship with individuals who are relevant to the youth's current situation. Typically, these folks would be the youth's probation officer, court or legal personnel, medical or social service providers, school counselors or teachers at the adolescent's school. Next you'll see a segment with the youth's school counselor. Four key points are illustrated in this segment: 1. The primary focus is on establishing a relationship - we prefer to start with a face-to-face meeting. In that meeting we obtain details about the crisis or other recent events and offer support for the counselor's burden. 2. It's important to explain the treatment program in practical terms - particularly its comprehensiveness - how all important areas of the youth's life are covered, including school and legal issues. 3. The meeting seeks collaboration. We're careful not to imply that cooperation would increase existing burden or create more work. Here the emphasis is on how the therapist will work to foster a relationship between mom and school, and, along with Christian's mom, check back in with the counselor about youth's behavior and progress. 4. You'll see a suggestion of specific next steps - one's forthcoming efforts to influence the youth, and reach out to mom about a school meeting. Also, note the request for cooperation from the counselor about her willingness to call the therapist at the first hint of any new problems for Christian at school.

00:45:15
COLLIN Yes, the lines will be ready. 

00:45:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Hi. 

00:45:20
COLLIN Hi. How are you? 

00:45:25
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Ah, thanks for doing this meeting with me. I really appreciate it. You know, Christian and his mom are, are, ah, are in this program, my program. 

00:45:30
COLLIN Okay. 

00:45:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE You know about the, the arrest obviously - 

00:45:35
COLLIN Yes. 

00:45:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE - and, and part of that, ah, the supervision that he's, that he's gotta, ah, abide by - 

00:45:40
COLLIN Uh-hmm. 

00:45:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE - and go through is, is a program, ah, that would include, ah, counseling for him and his family but part of what we're really trying to do is, is really get a grip on all the, the pieces, all of the parts to his life that basically are, are what, have come undone or getting unraveled. 

00:46:00
COLLIN Uh-hmm. 

00:46:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE And one of those pieces is what's going on for him here at school. 

00:46:05
COLLIN Mmm. 

00:46:05
HOWARD A. LIDDLE So I would imagine with his arrest here at school. This, this must have been an enormous event for you all. You go back always with him so basically I-- I'm looking for a help. I'm looking for you to, to help me figure out what's going on with this guy and let's see if I can help with the school piece in addition to the other piece that I'm doing. 

00:46:30
COLLIN Okay. Well, Christian - 

00:46:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

00:46:30
COLLIN - you know, he, uhm, made a bit production on our school about 2 weeks ago, got some drugs, cops came in and you know, I did a phone call about this kid who already had problems, not following school rules, teachers calling me, Ms. Collin(ph), what's going with Christian? He was okay the first year or so when he came out and the past 6 weeks had been terrible. I mean, you, you see the chart, I mean, these are-- I have more but, uhm, the problem is that he came to the school, he brought the drugs, I brought him for a meeting when he came back and his attitude was, I don't care. 

00:47:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uhm. 

00:47:10
COLLIN You know, I'm here to help. I'm a guidance counselor. I have work with hundreds of kids. 

00:47:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

00:47:15
COLLIN When they come back, we meet, we talk about how we can be of use. 

00:47:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uh-hmm. 

00:47:20
COLLIN How we can be of help to these kids - 

00:47:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uh-hmm. 

00:47:20
COLLIN - but Christian is a kind of young men who seem that he doesn't really care about his life, his school or anything. So, what can I tell you. I have my system of principle on my back - 

00:47:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uhm. 

00:47:30
COLLIN - telling me, look, Christian has been suspended. He's making a locust(ph) in the classroom. He needs to leave. And having him coming in the other day I can see why - 

00:47:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uhm-mm. 

00:47:40
COLLIN - you know, their sadness. 

00:47:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

00:47:45
COLLIN I mean, one of the teachers really care for him to be honest with you. 

00:47:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE This is really close, I mean, this - 

00:47:50
COLLIN He's very close. 

00:47:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE - close, close to, to being expel from this school. 

00:47:50
COLLIN One step away and I have a paper here and I can show it to you - 

00:47:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Right. 

00:47:55
COLLIN - where I just have to sign it. 

00:47:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE All right. 

00:47:55
COLLIN All I have to do is to sign it and, and that's it. 

00:48:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE He knows this? 

00:48:00
COLLIN I told him. I even called his mom. I called his mom, please, come in. Let's have a meeting. She didn't return my phone calls. 

00:48:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE So that's, ah, you know, that's well, well maybe that's why I come in with this because here's the, the two parts or maybe the three parts where you saying is, ah, you're in the situation here you don't have that much leeway- 

00:48:20
COLLIN Uh-hmm. 

00:48:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE - at this point. 

00:48:25
COLLIN Uh-hmm. 

00:48:25
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Right? It's, it's at the end of the rope for him here. 

00:48:25
COLLIN Yeah. 

00:48:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Do you feel like, hey, I reach out to mom, ah, in relation to really dyer situation here to, to get him engage, get his attention, get him to take it seriously. 

00:48:40
COLLIN Uh-hmm. 

00:48:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE And nothing comes back, okay. So let me work with her in that. I'd-- I mean, it seems to me we need a meeting. We need to get her over here for a meeting. 

00:48:50
COLLIN Well, this is I'm here to do. 

00:48:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Okay. 

00:48:50
COLLIN I'm the guidance counselor. 

00:48:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I know. 

00:48:55
COLLIN Being a guidance counselor is to help not only the student but bring the parent in. 

00:49:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I know. 

00:49:00
COLLIN But if I don't have anything where am I to work with? 

00:49:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I hear you and that's what I'm saying. I-- let, let me-- you let me reach out to her the therapist that was gonna say as we got the piece in cuz that is very distressing what you're telling me. 

00:49:10
COLLIN Uh-hmm. 

00:49:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE You're saying I reach out over there and nobody is calling me back. I, I sit down with him. This is in the heat, this is, this is like when you ought to have his attention. 

00:49:20
COLLIN Yes, 10 days suspension. You come back from a 2-day suspension you, you would... 

00:49:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE And then probation and it's all big time. So you, you-- I, I hear you and, uhm, that's troubling but look, ah, let-- let's, let's see if we can get on the scene. Let me reach out to him. I, I met with him once. I met with the mom. Once I met with the family, I mean, I want us to be in contact. I think as, as I said I, I mean, I know what's going on over here. You, you must-- this is just one of your -

00:50:05
COLLIN Uhm, I'm willing. 

00:50:05
HOWARD A. LIDDLE So I gonna-- let me work it through then. I'm gonna he-- reach out to you - 

00:50:10

COLLIN Okay. 

00:50:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE - just give me anything. You see what I'm saying about, about how he's doing, about something that, that happen you're worried about. I got the piece with the mom that you know, I told her you know, work on that with her. We're, we're gonna get her and we're gonna get her turn around. We're gonna get his attention on this and have him take it seriously just as you said but what I'm saying is that the, the outcomes for him in the school are vital and I know that this is a headache for you.

Session with adolescent 2 months into treatment 

00:52:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE The friends, uhm, is that something we, we should talk about? 

00:52:50
CHRISTIAN Oh yeah. Have this one friend specifically like he was my best friend and he got arrested. So now it's been, I don't know, sort of hard because I'd been thinking to myself whether I should stop drug using with him because now I can't obviously he's on jail. But now I'm only using on the weekends since I'm not hanging around with him every day after school. 

00:53:25
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uh-hmm. 

00:53:25
CHRISTIAN He's not there. I'm - 

00:53:25
HOWARD A. LIDDLE No. Not even there. 

00:53:25
CHRISTIAN - gonna go smoke a lot. 

00:53:25
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Right. 

00:53:25
CHRISTIAN So now I have to go do it by myself or socialize with people - 

00:53:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uh-huh. 

00:53:30
CHRISTIAN - on the weekends to go and get high. 

00:53:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So that's uhm, uhm, so that's, that's a dilemma here. Meaning, he could get out, ah, his, his detention, he's gonna be out sooner. Sooner rather than I think so I mean, you got thoughts going out by what's gonna be with him but... 

00:53:50
CHRISTIAN Yeah, but I don't wanna get in trouble again with him. 

00:53:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Well, you can be with him when he comes. He's, he's back, he's back when? He's back in a week, he's back in a couple of weeks on? 

00:54:00
CHRISTIAN He's back in a month. 

00:54:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Oh, oh, that's, that's gonna be year but-- whether, I don't know. I mean, I'll-- I'd like the, the part it sounds good to me but it's just doesn't seem like it can be hard, ah, to play this one, you know, you like this guy. 

00:54:15
CHRISTIAN Yeah, he's my best friend. 

00:54:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE You're best friend. Uh... 

00:54:20
CHRISTIAN We get high every day. 

00:54:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE So, where is this gonna go? 

00:54:25
CHRISTIAN I mean, my mom has been on my back with him also so if being with him just gets me more trouble with her and if I don't-- I think if I don't do something about it I also get vanished he's now behind the bar. 

00:54:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Did you think it is by yourself? You did? 

00:54:45
CHRISTIAN Yes. It's been a stress. 

00:54:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Oh. 

00:54:50
CHRISTIAN It's very... 

00:54:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Maybe stress isn't so bad sometimes cuz if this came out of stress I mean, I don't know. 

00:55:00
CHRISTIAN I guess so. 

00:55:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I've been up again but I, I got some thoughts going on. This is really, ah, yeah, you'd been thinking, did you talk to anybody else about this, this little piece of... 

00:55:10
CHRISTIAN I write it out. 

00:55:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Huh? So when you wrote this one out what was there thinking what you wrote? 

00:55:15
CHRISTIAN It was just more about hot it's hard to stay with a friend that you grow up with and now it's-- your parents that push you to not being free that gave you the freedom when you're born and now she's on my back more. Now coming to these meanings but I'm also like trying to actually - 

00:55:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uh-hmm. 

00:55:40
CHRISTIAN - get something out of this. 

00:55:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uh-hmm. 

00:55:45
CHRISTIAN You know, like my three meetings I did - 

00:55:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

00:55:50
CHRISTIAN - which to me was a hassle. I was just like that why I'm coming here. 

00:55:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:55:55
CHRISTIAN What? 

00:55:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Would you-- what, what-- yeah, and you probably push to that but, uhm, but this piece of this is, uhm, there is something happening inside at you that's a kind-- whatever kind of deep or something because you know, cuz you look, look at the way you talk about this like you go all over that, this friend all these years you put it in this whole, you know, space of like everything what I'm-- where been-- what I'm trying to do you, you got some ticking going on here seems to me. 

00:56:35
CHRISTIAN Yeah. 

00:56:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I mean, that's, that's looking good to me, sounding good to me. I hope it's to you too? 

00:56:50
CHRISTIAN I mean, using everyday isn't that something that's happening now and it's hard because I love just being high but I found my other drug and it was just to letting it out writing instead of keeping that in my head and getting high. 

00:57:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah, I know. 

00:57:15
CHRISTIAN But, yeah, still, I'm taking sometime. 

00:57:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE And that piece that other somehow this, this met somehow but that, ah, cuz listening on the way you tell the story that there's other, there's activity that I do I used, I used to do this thing. I like doing this thing as writing. This is me. It's important to me. I wonder it'd been good if I could do good for that. There was the time when everything is really hitting the fan. I'm not getting a good feedback about anything. I'm push around with this and that. 

00:57:50
CHRISTIAN Uh-hmm. 

00:57:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE That's not going good. Nothing else seems to be going good except getting high with the guy but I'm trying to put it in the-- in this flow like you-- you're in, you're in some kind of flow here that's, I know, it feels like a good thing. It feels like a-- there's something solid there. 

00:58:10
CHRISTIAN I don't see it, I guess. 

00:58:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE You don't really. I mean, well, listen to yourself. The way you, the way you talk about this, this, this guy and then-- and you're saying I, I need to change, you wanna change that. I-- that's assault to me, I don't know. 

00:58:30
CHRISTIAN If you see it. 

00:58:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE No. I, I don't-- uhm, maybe I'm making some more, I don't know. I'm just, I'm the outsider I'm saying, it seems to me it's solid. I'm still like well, okay, I wish the guy was here to tell you the truth. I wish he was out cuz then is like, oh men, this is really gonna get interesting to me like, let's get I know, was to get him in the room, you know, I'd love to be, ah, a fly in the wall, you know with that but anyway but I don't know it's-- right, I don't wanted to be it's not, it's not my thing. All I'm doing I'm just saying, ah, I think you got something solid there, ah, you know, congratulations on this. I'm doing-- managing your business there, ah, I wanna, I want us to bring this into the, into the meeting with, with mom and let's see what, what we can take up but I also hear you that good-- it's not, uhm, and you, and you got a different flow with you-- with drugs, with what's going on with you and, and using and smoking but I, but I hear you that, ah, the-- we're, we're gonna get that in the room, we have to get that in the room. So, so can you get ready for that in your mind? 

00:59:45
CHRISTIAN Yeah. 

00:59:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah, cuz that's a-- I mean, this part feels flow within and moving good. I, I hear what you're saying we got to work on this part of the, of the health cuz that's not, that's not good. It's no good for you for her day-to-day. It's not good for you, you day-to-day if this is kinda up and down in the house. There's no good. We can-- we would get that better. Okay, all right, and so, ah, le-- let me meet with her. 

01:00:15
CHRISTIAN Al right. 

01:00:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Okay. 

01:00:15
Chapter 8 Session with mother 2 months into treatment 

01:00:15
DIANA Hey doc. I'm just, ah, I was able to finally talk to that school counselor. So, and you know what, pretty well I find out that he is going to class a couple of times a week which is better than he was doing before but I'm still worried about him. 

01:00:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE You know, I don't work which you say exactly cuz I, I think it would be even more than the co-- if he was going a couple I think it's better than that. 

01:00:45
DIANA Yeah? 

01:00:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. I mean we gonna get, we're getting our fact straight but anyway but the, but the main thing is a, I mean, that was a big deal, nuh? 

01:01:00
DIANA Sure. 

01:01:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Before when you know, I mean, she responded, okay or good or what? 

01:01:05
DIANA No, yeah, I mean, before I just came up on the school because, you know, I was, I guess I was depending on the school to help, help me to all this stuff and, ah, I realize that, you know, I hadn't do my part as well and, uhm, you know, he's, he's texting me like we work through, you know, the other session and stuff. 

01:01:25
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

01:01:25
DIANA But, uhm, I still don't know where he's at - 

01:01:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah, 

01:01:30
DIANA - when he's texting me. 

01:01:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE No. 

01:01:30
DIANA Or I know he's still hanging out with some of these, these guys that are bad influences but, ah, he's texting me almost every day. 

01:01:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Okay, brilliant. So, I mean, let's think about this. Um, what do you think about this meetings I mean or he, he did the-- those probation, ah, case manager is, that's a good thing? 

01:02:00
DIANA Yeah. I mean, I, I think he's starting to realize a little bit that, uhm, he's going to end up in jail or like I know one of his friend ended up in a, in the prison or something, uhm - 

01:02:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

01:02:10
DIANA - I mean, it's hard to keep tabs and it's running around and it's strange with so many people. 

01:02:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

01:02:15
DIANA But it was one of his good friend and I know that there this one or I think I might have been a little bit of a wakeup call and stuff like that. I have seen him writing a lot nowadays at home. He won't let me look at it right now. 

01:02:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Then? So? 

01:02:30
DIANA You know... 

01:02:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Is that a bad of thing? 

01:02:30
DIANA No. I guess, I guess not. 

01:02:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Well maybe if I-- if you said, is there anything you'd like to look at I wonder if you (inaudible ) anyone. We'll see, yeah, but I mean your main thing there is, uhm, I, I think two things. You're, you're talking about, you're talking about you-- about your-- you're seeing something with him, aren't you? 

01:03:05
DIANA I am. 

01:03:05
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. I mean, part of this is a story of Diana here but, but here's another part of what his mom has seen and saying. 

01:03:15
DIANA Yeah. I, I feel I'm more comfortable I guess I wanna say I mean, it's been a really hard work and I, and I know, I still, I still mad, I still you hurt him a lot and, ah, still go off on him but I could see at work I'm a little le-- less stress out and, uhm, you know, there's the whole hard work could be done. 

01:03:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE You-- your, uhm, just I, I you know like again on the outside you're little all right I know you a little bit, ah, it's just, just so different to sit, I'm just here with you now, you know, I mean, something I, uhm, something strong is going on inside of you. You seem, I don't know, seems to me. 

01:04:05
DIANA Yeah. 

01:04:05
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Huh? 

01:04:10
DIANA I mean, I, I feel my relationship better with my mom and my daughter - 

01:04:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Right. 

01:04:15
DIANA - and, and Christian like I mean, there's this times that everybody is still that's where he would, ah, just listen more, you know. 

01:04:25
HOWARD A. LIDDLE You know, we have to do we, we, we, uhm, I think I think I have to help more with that. I think I have to help more with that. I think we, we could really, we got a, we got to bring this into the room. We gotta bring more-- you just said into the room next time. 

01:04:50
DIANA Okay. 

01:04:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Cuz that-- cuz there's a way of talking about this now I, I, I wish he was right here that to see, listen, to feel this right now. 

01:05:00
DIANA Uh-hmm. 

01:05:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Cuz there's something, you know, there's something moving and strong, you know, and right here in the way you just did now and I, and I wanna move. 

01:05:10
DIANA So he talk to you? 

01:05:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE He talk... 

01:05:10
DIANA He still not talking to me. 

01:05:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE No way. You could... 

01:05:15
DIANA I mean just a little bit but not how much I would like him to. 

01:05:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Okay, that surprises me. That, that surprises me and that's a little bit of a worry. I, I don't unders-- yeah, I don't get that. We, we gotta work on that. We can let's work on that. We-- so-- ah, but it's, you know, do-- I'm gonna ask you something, don't get offended. 

01:05:40
DIANA Okay. 

01:05:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Well, I should get to hear when people say that. 

01:05:45
DIANA Yeah, but I think we know each other after all these sessions. 

01:05:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE All right, Diana? 

01:05:50
DIANA Yes. 

01:05:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Do you des-- do you describe yourself as a pessimistic person or an optimistic person? You know, like a half floor or half I mean, how do you-- tell me how do you like you're talking to a friend or something, how do you des-- how do you describe yourself? 

01:06:05
DIANA Uhm, I'll be I guess I see all the negative in, in Christian. 

01:06:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I mean, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just fooling around. 

01:06:15
DIANA Cuz I know how to do better. 

01:06:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE He, he, he, he is doing better in some ways but I think you're right. I think it is right to hang on. You've, you've transformed you know, you-- you have change this, this deep stuff in, in you and it's much more complex. What's coming out of you now it must be coming through to him. It's, it's a much more complex thing that's coming out of you now yet. 

01:06:50
DIANA I wish he would tell me. 

01:06:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Well, that's what we're gonna do, that's we're gonna do. Any problems with that, I mean, if I said, you know, let-- let's go there, let's get this, let's-- what if he is here right now, you could do it? Right now? If-- I mean, if he were-- he-- what would you gonna say to him right now? 

01:07:10
DIANA I would just I guess ask him to maybe, ah, come home earlier, I mean the texting is all good and stuff and I'm on him constantly about it. 

01:07:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. But, but there's-- yeah, all right, well, okay. What else? What else? Keep going. 

01:07:30
DIANA Maybe more information on where he's at. I mean, even though - 

01:07:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Keep going. 

01:07:35
DIANA He's been lying on the text messages. 

01:07:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE You know, keep going. No-- did-- notice I'm, I'm serious. This-- I like it, this is good. What else? Let your mind go with this. Go. 

01:07:45
DIANA When we spend more time at home helping out around the house you know, like doing some chores and stuff. 

01:07:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Right, that would mean something to you more ways than one. What else? 

01:08:00
DIANA Yes I wouldn't mind him, uhm - 

01:08:05
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah, this is great. 

01:08:05

01:08:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE That's fabulous. 

01:08:15
DIANA - about him really writing stuff up- 

01:08:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE That's how it is. 

01:08:15
DIANA - and I would like to know more about him and he is my son. 

01:08:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Here we go. Now what else? There's one more I'm fishing for. I'm fishing for your part, I'm fishing for your part, I'm fishing for the thing that the, the thing that's going inside that you, that you wanna tell me that's what I'm fishing from you and I want-- and when he gets in there that's the part I'm gonna fish for, I wanna-- I wanted to come up and I wanted to come right through you, you know, to him. What would that part mean? 

01:08:50
DIANA I guess to let him know that I am proud of him. Yeah, it's just so hard you know, cuz when we're together he's like, his walls come up - 

01:09:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uh-hmm. 

01:09:00
DIANA - and it's so hard and, and, uhm, but ah, I am-- I can do see the difference in him now. I just wish I knew what, what he want for me. 

01:09:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE That's a.... 

01:09:15

DIANA All right. 

01:09:30
Chapter 9 Family session 2 months into treatment 

01:09:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Right now, I just thought it was so beautiful what you were saying. So let's get your thing get on here and get back to where we were. 

01:09:40
DIANA Okay. 

01:09:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE That's the thing. What are these things were talking about? You want to talk about same? 

01:09:45
DIANA I have seen he-- I've seen some change. I have to admit that. I mean, he's texting and you know, the counselor did say that you've been attending school and the English teacher was impressed with your writings. 

01:09:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

01:09:55
DIANA Well, why don't you share that with me? 

01:10:00
CHRISTIAN I mean, that's why I'm like write everything else. So I don't... 

01:10:05
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah, can you just sit here? We'll, we'll change. Thank you for doing it, yeah. Ah, well, go ahead, Diana, cuz he just saying writing play. 

01:10:15
CHRISTIAN When it comes to writing I just - 

01:10:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

01:10:15
CHRISTIAN - I just write everything out and I don't know if you would be willing to read what I say. 

01:10:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

01:10:20
CHRISTIAN I don't think you would be open to what I'm saying nor would you be disposed to what I write about. So, the way I behave you already criticize it in the way that I don't know if my writings should be exposed to you. So now it would something else you criticize about me and then I don't wanna be more criticized by. 

01:10:45
DIANA No, you could at least give me a try. Christian, I want, I want a relationship to work out. You're my son. 

01:10:55
CHRISTIAN I guess I could show you something that I have write. 

01:10:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE But isn't like a main thing? This is something that, that happens with you that's working for you in your life right now. This, you feel this is a good thing. She's a reader so it's a good thing, such a good thing and share the good things with me, okay, all that to say. So this is like a main thing like what's going on with Christian. Isn't that like, like the main-- it is about the writing but what's going on with my son? 

01:11:25
DIANA I wanted... 

01:11:25
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Isn't that what he's.... 

01:11:25
CHRISTIAN I mean, I'm going out not that much of my friends anymore like I told you about my, my best friend. I'm already telling you that he's not part of my life anymore because after he came out of jail I just thought to myself that maybe I shouldn't get involve with him anymore because I every time I go out with him you test me, you figure where I am and then I get in trouble. 

01:11:55
DIANA Uh-hmm. 

01:11:55
CHRISTIAN And I don't want that to keep happening between us. So in a way that I am trying to make our relationship feel better and if you feel like I should be doing chores and everything I mean, it is boring to be honest. I don't wanna be doing chores. I rather be go out with my friends. 

01:12:15
DIANA Of course you do, Christian but listen. We have-- it's all on me. I need you. I need your help. I, I need you to you know, clean up at-- maybe even after yourself, do your own laundry or something. I don't know. 

01:12:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE What else, what else you think is involve? One side of this always is from you know, the family that, ah, that the view of the rock bottom practical side of it, right, because you know, there's X amount of dirt and at least to get together to clean up that kitchen, right, twice, twice as this as if - 

01:12:55
CHRISTIAN Yeah. 

01:12:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE - that one, okay. But-- isn't there always something else like you're playing here. This isn't just any role. Who is this person? 

01:13:05
CHRISTIAN My mom. 

01:13:05
HOWARD A. LIDDLE This is my mother. And what is this? What is this, this two? 

01:13:15
DIANA A family. 

01:13:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE This is a family. So isn't it that where it's about to like see-- I mean, in a way... 

01:13:20
CHRISTIAN Like there was a family. 

01:13:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah, and, and does she-- isn't that what they want, isn't that what a parent is saying, I mean, yeah, they say it's about extra amount of dirt, we are the kitchen and you know. 

01:13:30
CHRISTIAN Yeah. 

01:13:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Well, I don't know. They-- I think they also-- they're trying to get the kid, ah...

01:13:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

01:13:40
DIANA You know he ask that one with me... 

01:13:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE You know what I'm say, yeah, Christian? Let me just, ah, just go with him. Let's see if I can make this... 

01:13:45
CHRISTIAN I mean I understand that I should involve myself more in the house cuz I'm-- actually I'm never home like to be honest and if I'm home I'm locked up in my room writing or just hang myself. 

01:14:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uh-hmm. 

01:14:00
CHRISTIAN But I think I could try to cook. I don't know how to cook but I think something out. 

01:14:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I wanna take it-- I'm asking you just may not work-- I'm, I'm asking you to take it out it should. 

01:14:15
CHRISTIAN What? 

01:14:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Take it out of the realm like it should - 

01:14:20
CHRISTIAN Uh-hmm. 

01:14:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE - and put it in like a-- a different realm like who, who is that? Why should I do that? Why is that important to her? A, a kind of them little different around I don't know, that's not working? 

01:14:40
CHRISTIAN I don't know. I see that point like - 

01:14:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uh-hmm. 

01:14:40
CHRISTIAN - and what I do was to prove to her like to be her son. 

01:14:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Who were just-- yeah, why do you have to prove? Your-- you... 

01:14:55
CHRISTIAN That I can be a good son. 

01:14:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE We got doing it but it were to do any-- if somebody is nice... 

01:14:55
CHRISTIAN Yeah, she has the perspective about me. 

01:15:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Which would be important to know or? 

01:15:00
CHRISTIAN Yeah, it was the way that she thinks I'm a lazy bone fat head makes me feel like I'm lazy bone fat. 

01:15:05
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Lazy bone fat head. 

01:15:05
DIANA Are you still smoking pipe? 

01:15:10
CHRISTIAN Not as much as before and you just don't know about it cuz... 

01:15:10
DIANA Cuz you don't talk to me. 

01:15:15
CHRISTIAN Well... 

01:15:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah, but, but-- well, well, he's, he's, he is talking right now. I'm listening and he is talking let-- I want-- I wanna stay with that. 

01:15:20
CHRISTIAN All right. So I would smoke every day, mom, but now I don't. Now I smoke on the weekends and if I ever do its occasionally like a big social gathering. Now on the weekdays like my friend is not there, the one used to use every day with, when we got to school he comes to me and say, Christian, what's happening? Why don't you come over? And I'm just like I guess I, I have to go home and work or I'm trying to find something else that is not smoke with my friend. 

01:15:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uh-hmm. 

01:15:55
CHRISTIAN And it's taking me a while but you just don't know it cuz I'm still trying to keep it to myself and figure out what is my next high. 

01:16:05
DIANA Uhm, wow. 

01:16:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE See, I'm just gonna do the-- we can do something here, it's little strange. I'm just gonna sit over here from that please don't, don't-- you don't have to move. I'm just wanna like-- I like-- I wanna talk to Diana and it's almost like you will pretend he's not here but I believe that's what coming out of here and I believe that we are-- he is trying to say that and he was trying to say that right now. Do you know what I'm saying right now? 

01:16:35
DIANA Yeah, I mean, I'm-- I, I understand him. I know like-- I expect a lot from him and I guess I got to realize that he is trying and having this-- he is moving forward. 

01:16:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE What this thing about high expectations? Why would that be? 

01:16:50
CHRISTIAN She is pushing me to somewhere where I don't yet understand where she want me to be. You're making me go from not being upon it to cleaning up the house to, to many things right now - 

01:17:05
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uh-hmm. 

01:17:05
CHRISTIAN - but with time I will grasp everything and be able to do it. 

01:17:10
DIANA I may hope so, Christian. 

01:17:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE But there were something more part-- something I thought was-- just straight... 

01:17:15
CHRISTIAN That I could do it. 

01:17:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

01:17:15
CHRISTIAN I could do my stuff on my own. I don't need to be push that much. 

01:17:25
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Huh? And maybe that's what we can work out. What she said-- what-- they gonna push you with some... 

01:17:30
CHRISTIAN I mean, yes, she's gonna push me harder cuz she expects things from me but you can't expect too many things out of me. 

01:17:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE What do you mean? 

01:17:40
CHRISTIAN I mean, I'm-- I'd been through a lot like I've change throughout things and I'm, I'm trying to stay in most positive I can. 

01:17:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE That's the part I'm recalling right now. Yeah, they are. 

01:17:50
CHRISTIAN And - 

01:17:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah? 

01:17:55
CHRISTIAN - I'm trying my hardest and it's working out - 

01:17:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

01:17:55
CHRISTIAN - but it seems that I want her to see - 

01:18:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

01:18:00
CHRISTIAN - that I am... 

01:18:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE That's-- I-- that's why I move over there, that's what I felt too. 

01:18:05
DIANA Christian, I am proud of you. I know, you-- I don't feel it because I'm so-- I'm strong all the time but - 

01:18:10
CHRISTIAN Yeah. 

01:18:10
DIANA - I need you to see my improvements too, you know? 

01:18:15
CHRISTIAN Yeah. 

01:18:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah, I know that. I think the, I think, ah, let's put a period there. I, I think that's where we're gonna go. 

01:18:25
CHRISTIAN But I'm telling you I wanna get my part - 

01:18:30
DIANA Well. 

01:18:30
CHRISTIAN - I'm just not gonna just... 

01:18:30
DIANA When I see it and I have, you know, I don't wanna put that, it's hard to change who you are when in all those years of you just-- you know, all that's happened. 

01:18:40
CHRISTIAN Just give me time and I'll grow more just slow, slow it down cuz you're pushing me too hard right now, to be honest. 

01:18:55
DIANA What should I do? 

01:18:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE What do you think about that, right? I have, I have-- I, I think that was come solid. I'm not saying we were-- but respond to him. I thought that this is (inaudible ) he's been with you. 

01:19:10
DIANA I'll, I'll try but I need to see you you're trying too. 

01:19:15
CHRISTIAN You'll see. 

01:19:15
DIANA No, I'm serious, Christian. I really need you to, to help me out. I mean, it's, it's like that it can't work in everything - 

01:19:25
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uh-hmm. 

01:19:25
DIANA - you know? 

01:19:25
CHRISTIAN Uhm. 

01:19:25
DIANA And to try to pay the bills and stuff, you don't see that, you don't see that part of it. I tried to keep that from you. 

01:19:35
CHRISTIAN Well, eventually with time hopefully after (inaudible ) part-time job. 

01:19:40
Chapter 10 Final Session 

01:19:45
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I think it was, it was beautiful what you did. I respect what you did. I'm privilege to have met you and being, you know, you let me come in and we-- I mean did our thing together. We really, ah, I just felt like we, we were a team, we won together. I mean, I just want, really wanted to, to, to come in and let's see what we could, we could mobilize with-- for this guy and for a woman who is really on edge of stuff and, ah... 

01:20:20
DIANA I learned a lot from your-- this sessions in how to deal with my, my stress and things that work at home and to give him some more respect and - 

01:20:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

01:20:30
DIANA - and understanding. 

01:20:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Like this family is gonna make it. That's what I felt. That's what I used to believe in. 

01:20:35
CHRISTIAN Yeah. 

01:20:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE You know? 

01:20:35
DIANA I hope so. 

01:20:35
CHRISTIAN We work out. At first, I was like there's no way I will make it through, there's no way cuz I just the weed, he criminal things, the everything and then, you somehow change it, my mom's mind in a way that made her more open to what I had to say and how I thought and now I feel more, I know, at ease when I'm home. So now I just I'm more of myself without being a bad son. 

01:21:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uh-hmm. 

01:21:15
DIANA No, I, I never said you are bad. 

01:21:15
CHRISTIAN Well, I felt that way. 

01:21:15
DIANA Oh no. I don't know I did. 

01:21:20
CHRISTIAN All the time. 

01:21:20
DIANA I'm sorry. 

01:21:20
CHRISTIAN We're good now. 

01:21:20
HOWARD A. LIDDLE But isn't it something? I mean, ah, I think that is a compliment that's a-- he's talking about something that's impressive for him. There's something about acceptance in what he just said it seems to me. 

01:21:40
DIANA Yeah. 

01:21:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE You know, in, in love, ah, isn't, isn't that a key point of life. 

01:21:45
DIANA Uhm, uhm. 

01:21:50
HOWARD A. LIDDLE You know? And that's it's a comment, ah, to, to you, I think that would be fabulous to let that inhabit you for a while. 

01:22:05
DIANA I mean, I've seen - 

01:22:05
HOWARD A. LIDDLE You know? 

01:22:05
DIANA - I've seen him help out now. 

01:22:10
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Go ahead, that yeah, I don't wanna be in the middle. I-- te-- tell your son everything that (inaudible ) 

01:22:15
DIANA Well, I know right from the beginning you know - 

01:22:15
CHRISTIAN Yeah. 

01:22:20
DIANA - really had a hard time for quite, quite a few years and, and uhm, I realize what I, what I've done and, and I'd also realize that you aren't really out to hurt me and you were against me you know. 

01:22:35
CHRISTIAN Yeah. 

01:22:35
DIANA So-- and, uhm, you're going to your own hard time as well and I guess I was so stuck in my own stuff and you're stuck in your stuff but you come a long way and I'm really proud of you. 

01:22:45
CHRISTIAN Thank you. 

01:22:50
DIANA All right. So I never wanna be back at that place again. 

01:22:55
CHRISTIAN I don't think it would happen. 

01:22:55
DIANA And all thank you for that. 

01:22:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah. 

01:23:00
CHRISTIAN Yeah, I don't think it's gonna happen. We already fix it, why go back? 

01:23:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uh-hmm. 

01:23:00
DIANA Right. 

01:23:05
CHRISTIAN I take another step back and I'm still using them to keep the things that are good, good because if I drop it out I know I'll go back into the pit I was. 

01:23:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Okay. So that's what I'm-- that's exactly, that's what I'm saying. So, like that's an example of something for you that, that is keeping you on that and then what's an example of something in this relationship with your mom? Is that-- there is always two sides of this thing that working with you. 

01:23:30
CHRISTIAN Well... 

01:23:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE What's going on with this guy and then what's going on over here (inaudible )? 

01:23:35
CHRISTIAN I'm collaborating more with you. I'm working out in the house and - 

01:23:40
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uhm. 

01:23:40
CHRISTIAN - trying to like make things look a little bit more neat cuz I mean, we can't have a perfect household but we have a good like it looks nice now, I guess, right? I'm trying. 

01:23:50
DIANA Yeah, I mean, I come home from work you know, and instead of having all these crap all over the place he is actually cleaned up some and I mean, his room can still need some, you know, need some work but, but I see that he's trying and he actually does cook one day a week which is a miracle. 

01:24:05
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Fabulous. 

01:24:05
DIANA And, ah, you know, I mean, and I love spending that time with him eating at dinner and I, I take off work early on that night, that's our night together. 

01:24:15
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Uhm, the other side of that Christian I was asking about was the, uhm, that the, the, the me out there in the road, me with the friends, me with... 

01:24:30
CHRISTIAN I get it. 

01:24:30
HOWARD A. LIDDLE I'm thinking about using-- or like go out. 

01:24:35
CHRISTIAN Yeah. 

01:24:35
HOWARD A. LIDDLE What's the guideline there? What's the main thing there in your mind. 

01:24:35
CHRISTIAN I got to find friends that are-- the ones that I had before that were drug users so that way get my life straight together cuz if not I'm too easily influence by them and not fall back so I just decided to change my circle of friends. 

01:24:55
HOWARD A. LIDDLE That's what you do. 

01:24:55
CHRISTIAN Which I haven't change to all of them but - 

01:25:00
HOWARD A. LIDDLE Yeah.
