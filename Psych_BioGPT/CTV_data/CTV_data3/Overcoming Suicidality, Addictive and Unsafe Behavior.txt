JANINA FISHER This is client number nine, CP and umm… so let me introduce you to… to CP, who is a 25-year-old young woman, uh… with a history of not traumatic attachment but umm… a rather dismissing attachment, uh… style of her parents leaving her very unprotected and fought her, uh… for the predators who molested her in her latency years. A fact that she did not remember, uh… so at the time, she dissociated and… and only when she was 13, did the memories start to return. I believe, it's 13, uh… and then began something familiar, the diagnosis of borderline, umm… because she started to self-harm and she'll talk about this in the session and… and so for the next 10 years, I'm gonna say, she was in and out of hospitals, umm… in and out of periods of feeling suicidal or making suicide attempts, and then finally received a diagnosis of Dissociative Identity Disorder or DID. I think it's… she says about 4 years ago and… and that began to turn things around. As the research says, it often does. Uh… The… the research is pretty clear a number of research studies have established that clients with DID are not diagnosed, uh… until they've been through many years of treatment. But when their diagnosis is followed by an appropriate treatment, that both acknowledges the trauma and the Dissociative Disorder. They do much… much better and the outcome results are actually quite good. Contrary to all the myths, of course, in the field and she is a very, very good example of that. She's come to me for a consultation with… this will be the fourth time I've met with her and because her therapist, her current therapist, doesn't have a lot of experience working with DID. And so I agreed to be a part of the team as a consultant meeting with her once a month to help her and the therapist, to keep this treatment on a very, very even keel. She's here today because in the course of one of our monthly consultation meetings, I told her about this project. And she was very interested because she really wants to communicate her experience to Mental Health Professionals and… and to help change the culture around suicidality, self-destructive behavior and Dissociative Disorders. So umm… so here we are and the issue that is really the major focus of the consultation series, my… my role on the… her team is to help her work with her suicidal part, and to… and to work also with a part of her that, umm… that… in the past has used drugs, uh… opiates, and has come very close to overdosing. So clearly, there's a risk that I want to help her address by changing her relationship to those parts. Uh… so I'm going to be using, umm… and this is a model, I've already taught her and her therapist, the structural dissociation model, which is well known throughout Europe. And not so well known in this country. It is… I consider it the really sanest approach to understanding dissociation and Dissociative Disorders, umm… built on a very scientific foundation and providing lots of opportunities to bring sanity to what can be a very tumultuous, uh… inner world. Also, the other thing I like about it, is that it's a trauma model, not a Dissociative Disorders model. So it's equally applicable to, umm… DID, Bordered Line Personality, uh… Complex Trauma Presentations of all kinds. And the model is built on… on the inherent, umm… compartmentalization of the human brain. The authors of the model Onno Van Der Hart (inaudible ) and Kathy Steele, start with the assumption that given that we already have a brain that has separate structures, they're quite… quite split off from each other. And that allows us to have different responses, sometimes opposing responses in the same body. So the theory says that under stress, the first place that all human being split is a right brain, left brain split, umm… because the right brain and left brain are really quite independent structures, umm… with only a little structure called "The Corpus Callosum," that's not in charge of joining them, merely in charge of getting them to talk to each other but that structure does not fully develop until after the age of 12. Meaning, these two sides are really relatively independent in childhood. And uh… and certainly anyone who's ever raised a teenager will attest to that because even though the corpus callosum may grow in around age 13, everyone, uh… who's ever parented a teenager, lives with this kind of, uh… a paradox that on the one hand, the left brain normal, sort of were mature part of that teenager is… is amazing, it's very functional, it's very responsible, it's smart, interesting. The right brain has terrible judgment because remember judgment is all left brain, umm… is driven by emotion and impulse and uh… and can act independently of the left brain's judgment and monitoring. The theory goes on to say that with repeated trauma, with on going conditions of Nicolette and abuse and if you, you know, when I hear the history of she, the quality of the attachment the… the basic foundational sense of safety wasn't entirely, uh… strong before she was abused. The abuse was repeated over a period of time. So all of that would contribute to the splitting between right brain related parts holding this Animal Defense Survival Responses a fight, flight, freeze meaning fear… fear and power(ph). Uh… Submission, helplessness, hopelessness, numbing, collapse and attach or cry for help. And interestingly enough, the attachment literature provides the only statistically significant predictor, umm… that we hear a really… there are very few significant statistical predictors in our mental health world but here's one, Disorganized or traumatic attachment in childhood is a statistical predictor of Bordered Line Personality or Dissociative Identity Disorder in adulthood. So umm… let's see how… how her relationship to… to their fight and flight parts, who've gotten her in and out of hospitals for the last 10 years. Let's see how that's going. So I'm glad you made it. 

00:10:40
UNKNOWN Me too. 

00:10:40
JANINA FISHER And I know we had talked about, uh… something to focus on today… 

00:10:45
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:10:45
JANINA FISHER …but given all of the transitions happening in your life… 

00:10:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… 

00:10:50
JANINA FISHER …we could also focus on… on how that is for your parts and what they need from you to… 

00:11:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. It's uh… really anything. 

00:11:10
JANINA FISHER Yeah, do you do that any, uh… a kind of intuitive sense of which would be? 

00:11:15
UNKNOWN Umm… I think we were… I've been sort of more focused on coming in with the stuff we've talked about. 

00:11:20
JANINA FISHER Okay. 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN …so sort of feels a little better. 

00:11:25
JANINA FISHER Okay, great. I love this… the inner sense of decision making. 

00:11:35
UNKNOWN I'm trying. 

00:11:35
JANINA FISHER And I'm sure… I'm sure that your parts had input to that too. 

00:11:40
UNKNOWN Yeah… yeah. 

00:11:40
JANINA FISHER Yeah… yeah. 

00:11:40
UNKNOWN You know, it's coming. 

00:11:45
JANINA FISHER And…and… and what's… (inaudible ) then we lasted last week? I can't remember. 

00:11:51
UNKNOWN I think it was last week. 

00:11:51
JANINA FISHER Yeah, it was last week. It was… I think maybe Wednesday, yeah. 

00:11:55
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. That sounds great. 

00:12:00
JANINA FISHER So… so you… we were… we were talking about… about your fate part, umm… which is also your suicidal part. 

00:12:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:12:15
JANINA FISHER And uh… and… and that part was okay with our talking, a little bit about… 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, I think it's come up a little more, umm… just the fight part, in general, this last week 'cause I've been kind of waiting for today and, you know, I kind of knew it was coming then it was gonna be talked about. 

00:12:35
JANINA FISHER And your fight part knew that too. 

00:12:40
UNKNOWN Umm… So yeah, I have… I have been kind of dealing with a lot of anger this last week and it may have been family stuff that I was dealing with and… but I don't know, it kinda woke up a little bit after we talked about it last week. So… 

00:13:00
JANINA FISHER Right. And you… when… when you said, you know, I'm in this terrible traffic jam, I'm coming from a… 

00:13:05
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… 

00:13:05
JANINA FISHER …visit to my family and I… I was thinking that you don't say goodbye to family would be very hard for your little parts, special your attached part. 

00:13:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. Not exactly, I guess umm… the attached part, you know, I don't… it didn't ever feel, I don't know. As a kid, it wasn't really there like the, uh… affection and the love and the really, you know, attached part that it needed and that's a big reason why, I have such trouble with my attached part is because, you know, I didn't really get… it didn't get what it needed as a kid… 

00:13:45
UNKNOWN So… 

00:13:50
JANINA FISHER Right and you really get that… that… 

00:13:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:13:55
JANINA FISHER That… it's… that, you know, there are facts of getting what we don't need and isn't safe… 

00:14:00
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… 

00:14:00
JANINA FISHER …but there are facts of not getting what we needed too. 

00:14:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. So it's not so much about leaving my family that sort of gets the attached part upset, when I leave home, it's umm… more just home in general and my animals there… 

00:14:15
JANINA FISHER Umm… oh. 

00:14:20
UNKNOWN …it feels like that so. It's, you know, my family is… I can live without… I'm obviously hours away but… 

00:14:25
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:14:25
UNKNOWN …umm… Yeah. 

00:14:30
JANINA FISHER Because often, you know, as we talked about last week… 

00:14:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… 

00:14:35
JANINA FISHER …the attached… when the attached parts upset, the fight part gets mobilized. 

00:14:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, 'cause the fight feel like it… like it needs to protect it and umm… yeah, it's… I usually feel more of a fight part than that attached part that need someone and is sad they don't have one. It's more of the fight part that comes out stronger. 

00:15:00
JANINA FISHER Oh, so that's your like… the… the smoke detector going off when you… when you feel the fight part… 

00:15:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:15:10
JANINA FISHER …get that. 

00:15:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:15:10
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:15:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. Like, you know, we talked about last week I feel like the flight and fight part have been most active throughout the years and the other parts have kind of tried to ignore the most. Umm… so the fight part, it's definitely louder than the attached part. 

00:15:30
JANINA FISHER And it would like to keep it that way. 

00:15:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… yeah. 

00:15:35
JANINA FISHER I wanted to fill in some of the implied, uh… remarks made here. About the uh… what (inaudible ) calls the fight… her fight part and her flight part. As you know, the animal defense of fight is about violence, control, pushing back, umm… but I think the… the theme of the fight response is really control. We fight to take control of the situation, to control the attackers ability to hurt us. Flight, a very… very different animal defense, flight allows us to distance, to run away, now flight is not a terribly effective defense for children, because a 3-year-old can't run very far, can't take care of himself or herself. Even… even a 12 or 13-year-old is… is limited in being able to flee or if he or she flees often ends up in an equally dangerous situation. So what we often see in trauma clients is that the flight part learns to flee in other ways, to flee via drugs, alcohol and a host of addictive behaviors that numb the body and… and literally take us away, uh… to another state of consciousness. Eating disorders, umm… all the Eating Disorders cause physiological numbing and uh… and at the heart of every Eating Disorder is the need to have a way to numb. Uh… and uh… again I write about this also in my new book. Uh… so she says, when those memories started assaulting me at age 13, it was my fight part and my flight part that came to the rescue. Her… her flight part, uh… began to seek relief in addictive behavior, her fight part, first in cutting and then she has a wonderful, there's a wonderful place later on where she talks about, how she developed tolerance to the cutting and then began, uh… to have more suicidal ideation because that… that brought relief. And then ultimately, just having ideation wasn't enough to get relief and she started or her suicidal part started to act. Very, very crucial that she make a relationship with those parts because… because otherwise, they will quite literally destroy her and she reports… I think she says something about it on the… on this of the tape. She talks about how, when she came to me for her first consultation and… and she began to understand the suicidality and drug addiction, as manifestations of the fight and flight responses, that had changed her whole relationship to those behaviors because she saw them as… as an attempt to help her that could actually kill her, and because on this side of the brain that… that observation is only logical. So let's see what happens as… as we both portray the addicted part and the suicidal part in ways that speak to their intentions, not their danger. You know that's, I mean, I think that's very, very important. As it… it… it makes sense of a lot of what you've been through that, you know, for whatever reasons and… and you know, my belief is that every child, every adult for that matter, umm… we instinctively choose or our bodies instinctively choose, the survival strategies that are most optimal. 

00:20:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:20:45
JANINA FISHER And if it's most optimal to fight, we fight even though we might not want to, umm… you know, if it's most optimal to flee, we might feel even that we don't want to. 

00:20:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:21:00
JANINA FISHER Umm… and so there was some reason, why your mind and body chose strength… 

00:21:05
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:21:05
JANINA FISHER …it's actually fight and flight over, umm… attach, submit or freeze. It's, you know… 

00:21:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:21:15
JANINA FISHER …'cause we have a menu of five of them. 

00:21:20
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… I could try to pick one but yeah, umm… I definitely I think initially when I first started seeing symptoms of the PTSD and things from, you know, my childhood it was initially the fight and then turn to flight and then back to fight again, you know, just over the years it's kind of been foot flopping back and forth. 

00:21:45
JANINA FISHER Right. And… and how… how old were you when you first started having these flashes and flashbacks then? 

00:22:00
UNKNOWN Umm… I first started having flashes of memory when I was 13, umm… and I hadn't remembered for a couple years. Umm… it just never crossed my mind then it hit me like a train. 

00:22:15
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:22:15
UNKNOWN Umm… And I… when I turned to the self harm, and cutting, and burning, umm… then turned to the suicidal ideation, and then came the drugs and alcohol later, couple years after that. 

00:22:35
JANINA FISHER Right. So you saw your fight part jumped in right away… 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:22:40
JANINA FISHER …to use hurting the body… 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:22:45
JANINA FISHER …as a way to get relief. 

00:22:45
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… And it was… 

00:22:45
JANINA FISHER …and it worked. I mean, and we have to acknowledge. 

00:22:50
UNKNOWN It worked for a while… 

00:22:50
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:22:55
UNKNOWN …yeah because it kept me from acting on my suicidal ideation but then when it stopped working, you know, I… and I became miserable again, I turned to the alcohol, and the drugs, and things like that. 

00:23:10
JANINA FISHER Right, with a little help from your flight part… 

00:23:10
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… Yes. 

00:23:15
JANINA FISHER You know, it sort of… I sort of… I sort of wonder sometimes, did the flight part, umm… did the flight part score some drugs and say, "Come on, this will help," or did you say, "Hey, find something that will help me?" 

00:23:35
UNKNOWN You know, I don't think it was a conscious thought. I think it just sort of happened as right, when the self harms, you know, started to not work anymore is when I started experimenting with alcohol and doing further drugs and realized that that also worked… 

00:23:50
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:23:50
UNKNOWN …not just the self harm and it was definitely used in combination for a while. 

00:24:00
JANINA FISHER Yeah. Because you know, I think what a lot of people don't realize is that… that like any kind of drug, you know, you achieve some… tolerance to self-harm too. So it stops working… 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:24:15
JANINA FISHER …and you need something more. 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:24:20
JANINA FISHER And you need something more. 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN And that's what happened is that wasn't enough and umm… and it was getting worse as far as the very… when I did do it and started to get… 

00:24:30
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN …you know, I started scare myself. And, you know, it was just me coming to a point realizing it wasn't working anymore, what else can I do? And, you know, I knew how drugs and alcohol made me feel and umm… flight came in soon after… 

00:24:50
JANINA FISHER Right, right, so… so it's not been a… a pattern that… that fight and flight try to save… save the day and then one day, you kind of wake up and say, "Oh my God…" 

00:25:05
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… 

00:25:05
JANINA FISHER …this… this is dangerous. 

00:25:10
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… yeah, absolutely, umm… you know, I know at this point that it's dangerous and I know that it's, you know, does not help in the long run. It's only a very short term. Umm… but I've definitely still struggled with, you know, not using the drugs and alcohol to cope and self harming, umm… but using, you know, the other tips and tricks and coping skills, I learned throughout the years is that are safe. 

00:25:40
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN I don't work as well immediately… 

00:25:40
JANINA FISHER Yes. 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN You know, it's not the immediate gratification but it's, you know, I've learned that it's easier in the long run to use those. I don't always use them. I don't always choose the right thing. 

00:25:55
JANINA FISHER Well, I think of it as… you know, any time that the triggering, the emotional pain, the feeling memories get to be too much. You've got you're fight part waving, it says like, "I can help." And you've got flights saying, "But, you know, you could do… blah-blah." And… And then you have… as I understand that, worked very hard to choose the safer, much more effortful, not as effective, safe ways of coping. 

00:26:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:26:45
JANINA FISHER And umm… but sometimes you're outnumbered. 

00:26:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:26:50
JANINA FISHER That's… that's kind of how… how I understand that. 

00:26:50
UNKNOWN It's a good way of putting it, yeah. 

00:26:55
JANINA FISHER And… and so ultimately, it… it takes a kind of some teamwork. It takes some alliance with those parts… 

00:27:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:27:10
JANINA FISHER …rather than a "You are gonna do it", "No, I'm not", "You are", you know… 

00:27:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:27:15
JANINA FISHER Notice that… that (inaudible ) makes… mention of how much it helps her to know about the parts, how much it helps her to be able to notice her thoughts, feelings, and impulses, and to name them. Oh, I'm feeling the… the fear, my partner's angry at me, I'm feeling the fear of my little girl part or my attach part, that she's going to give up on me or I'm feeling the wanting to, you know, wanting sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Uh… and I know that's my flight part. Oh now, I'm thinking about suicide. Huh, there's the suicidal part. And… and learning to recognize those voices and what we call dis-identify from them. And this is an important word… word it comes from the meditation world in which, umm… in mindfulness meditation. We're taught to identify, meaning to notice, uh… right noticing, the even flow of thoughts, feelings, and body sensations. But not identify with them, so that if feelings of suicidality or feelings of anger come up that the meditator keep noticing those feelings, without identifying, with… without getting attached to them, as I feel that way. So… so this is the work, uh… that… that I do and… uh… and… and it has a wonderful, wonderful effect. Just, you know, in the eating disorders world, the equivalent is the methods in which the Eating Disorder becomes ED. So now we have the client and… and there we have ED and ED keeps saying, your big as the house, you're fat as an elephant, and now there's another part of the client that can say, "I know you're worried about that, but I am not gonna stop eating. Umm… I don't see it the same way you do." That's… that's really, umm… you know, I think that the Eating Disorder treatments focusing on ED, as the other to whom the client is in relationship. Uh… very much, uh… is similar to the work that we're doing here. So let's see what happens. 

00:30:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, sometimes it's a fight, you know, I… I've, you know, and now knowing about the parts is a lot easier to differentiate, you know, what's going on. Even just since, you know, I've seen you, and umm… you know, but I… I have tried really hard to use the safer alternatives. Umm… you know, because I… I have gotten to quite a few really low points where I realize it's either I'm not gonna survive this or I'm gonna, you know, try and climb out using the see through, you know, coping skills and umm… so, you know, it is definitely a fight sometimes and I don't realize that I'm realizing now that it has been me, my adult self fighting with my younger parts and that's what it's… what it's been all these years, it's just me fighting against me. 

00:31:25
JANINA FISHER Right, right, and… and all… and all part is feeling this sense of life or death like… like but I hear, you know, uh… for me, the thing that really, umm… I think it helped me to change my whole point of view toward self harm, and suicidiality, and addiction, umm… is… was understanding that fighting flight so the addict part, the suicidal part just want relief. And… and there, and… and it's because the feelings feel more dangerous than death that they don't… it… it's I don't think it's even real to them, do you? 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN No, to them, you know, the being suicidal and death as, you know, it's… to them they do… they do, they see it as relief. They see it as another way out, another way to feel better or not feel at all and umm… yeah, it's… it doesn't but when I look at it, my adult self looks at it, I realize no, that's… that's the end, you know, I can't… I can't go back if I do choose that, umm… 

00:32:55
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:33:00
JANINA FISHER Right, all right. 

00:33:00
UNKNOWN It's that going not as serious to them and say, "Well why don't you just do this? It's just… 

00:33:05
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:33:05
UNKNOWN …nonchalant and they're talking about it in my head. 

00:33:10
JANINA FISHER Absolutely, it's like, this is your salvation and without… but you know, I always think of the fight and flight parts, as teenagers because umm… you know because we have to be, you know, fighting and running, don't do us a whole lot of good, when we're 12, 13, 14 anyway. So you know, if I think well, when you're 14, 15 or 13, umm… death isn't real to you, you know… 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… Yeah. 

00:33:50
JANINA FISHER …and but this idea that you can get relief your way is… is definitely real to a teenager, don't you think? 

00:34:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, Mm-hmm. absolutely. Yeah, when I was, you know, I think the suicidal ideation really started to hit me along with, you know, depression and more anxiety at around 15, umm… and I didn't understand, what was going on in my head. I don't understand why I was feeling that way, I hadn't even connected the dots that it was, you know, the horrible childhood, you know, with the abuse that I had, that's what it was, you know, why it came up then and umm… 

00:34:40
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN So at that point, I didn't understand it, umm… until I got about 18, 19 and I really started to understand that… 

00:34:50
JANINA FISHER Make that kind… 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN …for now I've been, how final that decision was. 

00:34:55
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:35:00
UNKNOWN And then I started to fear those thoughts and… 

00:35:00
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:35:05
UNKNOWN Umm… plans that I had made, you know, years in the past like if it ever gets this too bad and, you know, gonna do this and it started to realize how serious that was… 

00:35:15
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:35:15
UNKNOWN You know, once I got 18, 19, so… 

00:35:20
JANINA FISHER Right so, so if… right, that makes so much sense that when you're… your brain grew that extra, you know, inch… 

00:35:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… 

00:35:35
JANINA FISHER …that it grows were 18, 19. You could really say, "Oh my god. This is…" you know, "This is not the comfort…" 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:35:45
JANINA FISHER "…that I thought it was. This is… this is scary and serious." And, you know, you can be my consultant, right now, because I've been teaching therapist to ask people who are… who share with suicidal ideation, the following question, and you can tell me if I'm out of my mind, if it's a dumb question or if it's a potentially dangerous question. So instead of the usual questions that they're… asked, are trained to ask like there are so trained to ask, do you have a plan? 

00:36:25
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… 

00:36:30
JANINA FISHER Umm… and then there's then more trained that if the client has a plan that means they're in immediate danger. And my experience has been that some trauma survivors have a plan for 20, 30, 40 years that they never act on or they have rarely activity on but having the plan is a comfort. So I started asking people the following question. I would say, "When you have that wish or impulse to die, do you feel more comforted or more anxious?" 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… umm… yeah. 

00:37:20
JANINA FISHER Because here's my theory, the reason I thought of that question was because my experience is similar to yours that when my clients have gotten scared of suicidal ideation, it's been because they're further(ph) in danger. 

00:37:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:37:35
JANINA FISHER When they feel comforted, usually, they don't have to act on the impulse because they feel… 

00:37:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:37:45
JANINA FISHER …they feel comfort and they don't feel this, "Oh my God, I'm being possessed and I know something bad is gonna happen." 

00:37:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, and now it's… I've never… yeah, never heard that… 

00:37:55
JANINA FISHER Nobody's ever asked to that. 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN I know, I've definitely heard have got a plan… do you have a plan? 

00:38:00
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:38:05
JANINA FISHER And the answer is always been the same. I've always had a plan. I always had the same plan. I came up with this plan a long time ago. 

00:38:10
JANINA FISHER Right, when you were young. 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN And… but and I didn't realize that was so common either… 

00:38:20
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:38:20
UNKNOWN So it's almost comforting just hearing that from me now that… that is, you know, something that isn't just me, that… 

00:38:25
JANINA FISHER No. 

00:38:30
UNKNOWN You know, I don't… you know, I've just always had the same plan since it started and umm… you know, I would say that when the thoughts start to get, you know, more serious, and severe, and I am thinking more about acting on my plan, I'm definitely more anxious than comforted. 

00:38:50
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:38:55
UNKNOWN Umm… Because that's when I start fighting with myself and trying to decide am I going to or am I not? Umm… you know, thinking what do I have left to live for, you know, like what's gonna keep me from doing that or is there even a reason to, it's just this back and forth, back and forth in my head, that one I saw. 

00:39:15
JANINA FISHER This is where I want to really draw to your attention, the paradigm shift in… in the view of suicide and suicidality, that's represented here. And uh… and, you know, it's really exciting to have a paradigm shift because I have worked with suicidal patients for something like over 30 years, and the old paradigm was incredibly, exhausting, and anxiety provoking, as I'm sure you all know. Umm… Feeling the responsibility and of having to ensure a client's safety and all of the responsibility that it puts on the therapist. Uh… Without necessarily, increasing the safety levels. So this paradigm, reframe suicide as an attempt to cope with overwhelming feelings and a subjective sense of loss and control, and… and so the… the… the point that I want to make here is that suicide planning and suicidal ideation often are a way to provide comfort or the relief of feeling there's a way out. And I often use that language with clients. I say, "Oh, so the suicidal plan part is offering you a parachute." "Oh, so the suicidal part is… is… is plugging the exit route strategy." Umm… Believing that you're not strong enough to handle these feelings and to handle… handle these vulnerable parts. So I use the opportunity of this consultation and video session to ask (inaudible ) to be the expert on the degree to which these suicidal ideation and even having a plan is comforting and how she can tell when the risk starts rising. And ensuring of she can, she can tell from her body she gets anxious. So this feels like it's a very useful piece of work for her to pay attention to the suicidal ideation and whether she's responding with relief or anxiety and also a way for her to contribute to the paradigm shift. And umm… because what she says is, it didn't help me at all to think that I wanted to die that I was suicidal. Umm… It helps me more to locate that in the fight part or the fight part is offering this way out. But that part doesn't speak for me. I want to live. I want to have a life a future, a family and I and I don't need to die. So this, this is a very… very important shift because as… as she tells us when suicidal ideation, when cutting or when having a plan that has been in one's back pocket for many years as opposed to a plan for tomorrow, which would be for me a higher index of risk. When as she is able to become aware of those patterns and to… and to verbalize them without early needing her suicidal part, she is stabilizing more and more the risk of suicide is going down because now when she has those thoughts, she says, "Oh, the suicidal part must be worried about… uh… about my ability to deal with these feelings." So let's go on. Let's see what happens next. And, and, you know, here's the thing that's that I think will be helpful to know. When, I mean, you, you get the parts peace of this, so you can imagine now the suicidal part saying to you. What do you have to live for? Come on, come with me, you're on my side. 

00:44:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:44:50
JANINA FISHER And… and how proof sways of that feels in the moment. 

00:44:55
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:44:55
JANINA FISHER And, and I think the… the kind of the, I don't know what quite a culture the crux of it is that as soon as we say I feel suicidal, I want to get out of here. I want, you know, a drink or drug. We've just agreed with the part that has the impulse. 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:45:30
JANINA FISHER And… and so and the more we say this is how I feel, the more blended we get with the part. You know, what you've probably already started to feel this. When you're separate from the part and you can feel and see the part, it doesn't have the same power. 

00:45:50
UNKNOWN No, not at all, you know, since the first time we met and you asked me to, you know, never I start to feel any bit uncomfortable or start feeling any feeling that I don't like just sort of ask myself what part is it and ask them what they need or want for me at that time. And just doing that has been, has taken so much power out of a lot of my urges is, you know, if I'm feeling like I have, I wanna use and I wanna go out and buy drugs. That's what well… well, that's my flight part talking in me. What am I trying to flee from, what am I trying to escape from, you know, how can I change it? And even if I don't know, what that part needs from me in that moment… 

00:46:35
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:46:40
UNKNOWN …just knowing that it's that part and being able to place that feeling with that part… 

00:46:45
JANINA FISHER Yes. 

00:46:45
UNKNOWN …is it separates everything it doesn't… 

00:46:45
JANINA FISHER Right! 

00:46:50
UNKNOWN …you know, sort of puts this divide in between me and my adult self now and, you know, my flight part then. And it's… it's helped tremendously more than I thought it would. 

00:47:00
JANINA FISHER That's great. And, you know, you… you have a gift because, you know, I probably say the same words 20 times a week. Remember, any thought, feeling or physical reaction that feels uncomfortable that are just stressing is always a communication from our part. 

00:47:25
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:47:30
JANINA FISHER Not… not everyone takes that lesson and run through that. 

00:47:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:47:35
JANINA FISHER So it… it goes to show that you… you have a very determined going on with normal lifestyle. 

00:47:40
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:47:45
JANINA FISHER Which is, you know, is why you're here? 

00:47:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. It's a good thing. 

00:47:50
JANINA FISHER Yeah. And, and that's why I said last week I think part of the problem is that the fight and flight parts have been so busy saving your life from "their point of view," that they haven't noticed that you were grown, that you have a window of tolerance. 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:48:15
JANINA FISHER That you're, I mean, I can imagine that 13 you didn't. 

00:48:20
UNKNOWN No. 

00:48:20
JANINA FISHER You know, what a nightmare. But you actually have the ability now to feel uncomfortable and to say, what part is that? 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:48:30
JANINA FISHER You're not immediately overwhelmed and tsunami down to the sea. 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:48:40
JANINA FISHER All right. 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN And I wasn't always that way so… 

00:48:40
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN …you know, life, you know, I've gained some tolerance to the uncomfortable feelings over the years. It's umm… it hasn't been easy. 

00:48:50
JANINA FISHER No. 

00:48:55
UNKNOWN It's… and I've struggled with, you know, gaining that tolerance for a long time. Because it used to be that any little thing would set me off and send me in a spiral and now I would snowboard downhill and, you know. 

00:49:05
JANINA FISHER We, you have a lot of help. 

00:49:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:49:10
JANINA FISHER Because I can imagine, I can totally imagine the vicious circle. So tell me if this is right? And, you know, I can imagine you getting triggered by this overwhelming images and memories. And at the age of 13, when by the way nobody has a window of tolerance at 13. If you've had trauma, it's less than zero but it's not that big even if you have a totally safe, uh… childhood up to that point. Umm… And… and then I can imagine fight and flight started to get activated to, you know because you've… you've noticed that we've talked about too how fight and flight have such a strong reaction to vulnerable feelings. Perhaps… 

00:50:10
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… Yeah. Don't feel those. 

00:50:15
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN Those, yeah. 

00:50:15
JANINA FISHER Right. But it's hard not to feel vulnerable when you start having flashbacks. And its crazy stuff is happening in your head and… and at that time you don't know what it is. 

00:50:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, I didn't understand it then it's I had no idea what was going on with me and I was too afraid to talk to anybody about it. And I thought I was going crazy at 13, what I thought was, you know, going crazy and it that, you know, that wasn't the case, I didn't, I couldn't… I wasn't capable of putting two and two together at that age. 

00:50:55
JANINA FISHER Yeah. Mm-hmm. 

00:51:00
UNKNOWN Umm… So yeah it's… 

00:51:00
JANINA FISHER And, you know, one of the things that people have noticed about… about trauma and abuse for the last 30 years. Umm… and I think it persists to this day it's less now but it's when… when… when you're getting all these flashes of… of something that's unbelievable. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:51:30
JANINA FISHER You know, even if you're like a really, umm… you know, matured bright 13 year-old, you… you kids really hard to, I mean, first of all, you're overwhelmed so that interferes with many things together. 

00:51:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:51:50
JANINA FISHER But also this sense of no we couldn't possibly have it like them. 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… And that thought had, you know, definitely went through mind for a long time. 

00:51:55
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:52:00
UNKNOWN You know, and because I umm… because I didn't remember it for two years. It was like, you know, my brain and body had… had enough. By the time it had ended the abuse had ended that it just shut down and I had no memory… no memory of those two years. But, you know, I didn't I don't remember thinking about it for at least that long until I was 13 and it hit me. And I thought I had trumpeted, I thought I was dreaming or all that I was making it up or you know, I didn't, I didn't know for sure for awhile if it was actually real. Umm… 

00:52:45
JANINA FISHER And… and uh… and it and that would make sense that you would doubt yourself. 

00:52:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:52:50
JANINA FISHER Umm… And that's what I mean about how do we put together the unimaginable… 

00:52:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:53:00
JANINA FISHER …and uh… and because (inaudible ) I guess I can see how fight and flight umm… freaked out. 

00:53:10
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:53:10
JANINA FISHER Because you were understandably overwhelmed. 

00:53:10
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:53:15
JANINA FISHER And… and… and so they came to the rescue. 

00:53:20
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:53:20
JANINA FISHER And then I'm wondering if… if it was kind of a vicious circle because… because fight and a flight can be a little overwhelming too. 

00:53:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Yeah, it was a vicious cycle, it was, you know, am I, I never knew what I was gonna be feeling the next day or which, you know, at that time I didn't know the fight and flight part but I didn't know if I was… 

00:53:45
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:53:45
UNKNOWN …going to want to or need to self harm or use or drink or whatever it was, you know, I… I felt like I was up and down constantly. 

00:54:00
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:54:00
UNKNOWN And never knew how I was gonna wake up the next day. 

00:54:05
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:54:05
UNKNOWN And how old were you when… when someone, umm… diagnosed you as having a Dissociative disorder? 

00:54:15
UNKNOWN Umm… believe I was 16 I think 15 or 16… 

00:54:20
JANINA FISHER And… and did that help or was that… was that hard? 

00:54:25
UNKNOWN Umm… No, it was. Uh… I guess both, you know, it… it helped to know that there was, you know, an explanation for how it was had been feeling for so long, felt like forever at that time. 

00:54:40
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:54:45
UNKNOWN Umm… But it was also, it felt like something was wrong with me at the same time. 

00:54:50
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:54:50
UNKNOWN And I was very self-conscious about it. 

00:54:55
JANINA FISHER Mm-hmm… 

00:54:55
UNKNOWN And, you know, very few people even people I was closest with and loved, you know, didn't know. 

00:55:05
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:55:05
UNKNOWN And… yeah. 

00:55:05
JANINA FISHER Right. Yeah. And that's so I think that's probably the hardest thing, umm… is the… is that, I mean, you know, to me to be having parts of dissociation is really normal. But… but I recognize that's not true of the whole world. 

00:55:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:55:30
JANINA FISHER Umm… And… and obviously you have a long term relationship with your partner. 

00:55:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:55:35
JANINA FISHER And uh… umm… does she get freaked out by the parts or she comfortable? 

00:55:40
UNKNOWN No. She's… she's very understanding and comfortable. And umm… you know, she's… she's also being trained right now to be in the mental health field. And so it… it plays out really well for me because she's being, you know, trained to how to do these things and she has worked in the field. 

00:56:05
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:56:05
UNKNOWN And umm… you know, so she and she is but she's learned with me through even just our relationship and umm… you know, what works, you know, if I am and a full on flashback and I'm not present. You know, she's sort of found different tips and tricks on her own that she has realized, that helps to get me back in the present again. And… 

00:56:30
JANINA FISHER Cool. 

00:56:30
UNKNOWN It's only been a learning process for both of us. But, you know, she's probably the most understanding I could have in a partner, you know, it's just, you know understanding completely, you know. 

00:56:45
JANINA FISHER Right. And uh… where it's gonna make her a good therapist. 

00:56:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:56:50
JANINA FISHER She is… 

00:56:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. She's gonna be awesome. 

00:56:50
JANINA FISHER She's gonna be awesome. 

00:56:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, so… yeah, so… yeah, so we both taught each other a lot. So umm… because she's been able to help me with things that she's learned in her training and everything, you know. 

00:57:05
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:57:05
UNKNOWN Like here, I heard about, you know, this like, you know, what do you think and you know, if I'm open to it all. 

00:57:15
JANINA FISHER Yeah. And that seems to be a very clear, umm… sort of position you have. I'll try anything, you know, that it does, it's like totally… 

00:57:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:57:25
JANINA FISHER …after, I mean, I'm sure with everything. 

00:57:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:57:30
JANINA FISHER But that attitude, umm… is a very… very… very helpful attitude. To some just fight, fight with you sometimes around, you know, whatever it, what are you… what are you agreeing to? 

00:57:45
UNKNOWN Uh… absolutely. It's very hesitant and doesn't trust every decision that I make. Umm… It wants to have all the power most of the time. Umm… So the fight part is, you know, does fight with me a lot. Umm… 

00:58:05
JANINA FISHER Yeah. And I can see, you know, if the fight part sill experiences you as that 13 year old, umm… you know, you could understand why it would be like what… what are you agreeing to, let us, you know, at you, at your mind. 

00:58:25
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… Yeah. 

00:58:25
JANINA FISHER Let me… 

00:58:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:58:25
JANINA FISHER …be in charge of what you try. 

00:58:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. And… and usually it's all about, you know, just wanting to protect me as the part, you know, it's all in wanting to feel protected. And if there's something new or something it doesn't know about anything that is suggested to me that it's not sure of it, you know, definitely makes itself known. 

00:58:50
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:58:55
UNKNOWN Umm… so and that will come out as anger or just shut down completely. And, you know, the suicidal ideation thoughts about self harm. Umm… 

00:59:05
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:59:05
UNKNOWN But it definitely comes out. 

00:59:05
JANINA FISHER What you have just seen is a piece of work that has to do with strengthening or building an alliance, with the fight and flight parts as protectors. Because what (inaudible ) has said before to me in other sessions, is that it never helped her to be told that her suicidality was bad. And not obviously bad in a moral sense but… but she had been told over and over how dangerous her suicidality was, how… how she had to fight to overcome it. This is a very… a very… a very different. And a mindful, a mindfulness influenced approach of accepting the suicidal ideation impulses planning and keeping a mindful distance from them by noticing them as other, right, noticing it as a part. Oh, my suicidal part is reacting to the fight, my partner and I had last night. Uh… And, you know, and I really don't need that extreme solution. We just have to fight, it upset by attached part but… but we're okay. So again the normal life part knows that… that fighting with one's partner is just part of normal life. Attach and fight are triggered to extreme reactions. So this approach of allying with the suicidal and uh… and addicted parts, umm… I think of as a "No thank you approach" and I often do that with clients. The client and I will be talking about the flight parts, umm… and this… this actually happened to (inaudible ) or something close to it. I think the… the… the flight part kept, umm… flooding her with, umm… ideas of all the different substances she could take, which would make her vulnerable feelings go away. And uh… a little… little bit like a, you know, heavy marketing, you know Super Bowl commercials, umm… by the flight part. And… and she was able to identify, "Oh, the fight part is really working on me. And yet to be clear but I don't want to go there, I don't want to do drugs." So… so this is… this is the paradigm shift and… and what I also notice and appreciate about it as… as I do this work and… and really find my way to making it a more and more useful model, is that when, you know, when she says to her fight part, thank you, umm… but no thanks. Umm… There is a growing relationship between the two. There's a relaxing in the body that's very different. When she describes fighting to exhaustion with her fight part, the fight part would be… that would be mobilizing strong impulses in the body, which she would have to fight against. And… and she says several times it was exhausting for both of us that's… that's really what we want to avoid. Because if we're thinking for a body perspective how much better… you don't fight the river, all right. So she says, "Oh, you're trying to help me. Thank you so much for offering." And… and so then it's also a like it reminds me always of tai chi, I call it doing tai chi with parts. Umm… She goes with the energy of the fight part and then she comes to a place and says, "But I… I don't really need that old one that right now but thank you anyway." Uh… That has a very calming, uh… effect on the body and it recalibrates the traumatic reactions in the nervous system. So… so let's go on… That's great that you are… that you're beginning to get the language the fight part speaks in. 

01:04:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:04:30
JANINA FISHER Right? 

01:04:30
UNKNOWN Starting to… 

01:04:30
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

01:04:30
UNKNOWN It's different and it's something to adjust to. But I have tried a lot of different ways of healing my timeline, my past and, you know, like you said at this point, I'm willing to try almost anything if I feel like there's a good chance that it could help. 

01:04:50
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:04:55
UNKNOWN Umm… Because I know what doesn't work for me and so now I'm trying to find things that do. 

01:05:00
JANINA FISHER Yes. Beautiful. And… and, you know, I'm curious if this would be in a way a little bit different scenario, but it's one that the fight part might like and you might like because I'm thinking that may be if the fight… it might be actually a good idea just in the practice to always do a little check with the fight part. You know, are you cool with this? Because I think… I think it's true I think your insight is right that… that the fight part needs to have that control, you know… 

01:05:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:05:50
JANINA FISHER It's like the President's Secret Service. You know, like, you know if they don't want Obama getting out of limousine, he doesn't get out of the limousine. Right? 

01:06:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:06:00
JANINA FISHER It's… that's how it is. And… and that's the spirit in which your fight part wants control. 

01:06:05
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… 

01:06:10
JANINA FISHER You know, you're not getting out of the limousine because I have not determined if this is safe. 

01:06:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:06:15
JANINA FISHER All right? 

01:06:15
UNKNOWN And I think that's sort of where the, you know, where it's been the hardest when, you know, since I've been speaking in these parts and acknowledging that… that they are… is you know, I know that, you know, fight and flight, fight especially wants control over everything. But it's been hard finding that compromise in the middle was, you know, fight not getting overwhelmed and too… too powerful but at the same time still allowing it to have a space in my life. And that's I think been the hardest part as with the fight part. 

01:06:55
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:06:55
UNKNOWN And letting that part have, you know, some sort of control to make it feel like it's needed and wanted and… 

01:07:05
JANINA FISHER And because it's good at control, you know, people like you and me and your partner, you know, we're not as good at control as a fight part. 

01:07:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:07:20
JANINA FISHER You know, because we want people to get along, we wanna be collaborative, we want everybody to agree. And the fight part is like no, just no, I don't care if people like, you know, I don't care if they agree. 

01:07:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:07:35
JANINA FISHER So what I would suggest for you in the fight part is… is kind of, umm… a theme like the two of us, you know, the two of us are stronger than either of us alone. 

01:07:55
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:08:00
JANINA FISHER Because it is true that the fight part gives you a… a strength and energy. I mean, you just obviously have a lot of strength and energy but definitely the fight part gives you more. 

01:08:15
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:08:15
JANINA FISHER But you… you are a better communicator and… and… and probably, although, I think if there are, if I think about most people including myself, umm… any part that's hyper vigilant is kind of sense danger way before we do, you know, let's face it. 

01:08:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

01:08:45
JANINA FISHER And so but you know, what they're going on with normal life self has access to this part of the brain… 

01:09:00
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:09:00
JANINA FISHER …that can see the whole… the whole, you know, the… the bigger picture. 

01:09:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:09:10
JANINA FISHER So… so the fight part could say, "I don't like the looks of that person." 

01:09:10
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:09:15
JANINA FISHER And… and who have the ability to see the whole picture… 

01:09:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:09:20
JANINA FISHER …and… and to be able to say, "Yeah, maybe he does look creepy." And uh… and this is kind of like a… a weird situation or yeah, he looks creepy. But look… 

01:09:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:09:35
JANINA FISHER There are, you know, there are a million people here. 

01:09:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:09:40
JANINA FISHER And… and there's no way that that person over there can hurt me… 

01:09:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:09:45
JANINA FISHER …as long as I'm around safe people. 

01:09:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, that's funny, that's actually a situation that comes out for me quite a lot… 

01:09:50
JANINA FISHER Really? 

01:09:55
UNKNOWN …is sensing danger and, you know, a person and it is, it's always been hard for me to, you know, tell myself that nothing bad is gonna happen I'm in public or I'm, you know… you know, I know that there are an okay person and that they're safe. And umm… it's getting easier to reassure that part that says no, like run or, you know, put up my fear is that, you know, whatever maybe the reaction but it's umm… it's definitely something that comes out for me a lot and if I had to work on. Umm… because I used to just shut down and just, you know… 

01:10:30
JANINA FISHER Right. And then you really would be at greater risk. 

01:10:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:10:35
JANINA FISHER That's the irony. 

01:10:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:10:35
JANINA FISHER And, you know, this is why being able to… to have a conversations with your fight part and to negotiate is so important. 

01:10:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:10:55
JANINA FISHER So, you know, I've had people who… who have fight parts that are very angry and go around telling everybody off. So sometimes they negotiate in agreement where they promise to take the fight parts anger seriously, it exchange for the fight part letting them communicate that there's a problem. 

01:11:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, and that makes sense. 

01:11:20
JANINA FISHER Yeah, so you could say, okay, I'm gonna trust you that if you think something's or somebody is creepy, I'm gonna… I'm gonna trust you but you have to trust me about my ability to take care of myself. 

01:11:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:11:40
JANINA FISHER Because obviously, all alone, you know, on a dark street you would agree, okay, you know… 

01:11:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:11:50
JANINA FISHER I think, I… I think I wanna over at the rest of the way. 

01:11:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. 

01:11:55
JANINA FISHER Uh… But, you know, in… in the hospital lobby waiting for, you know, news about your partner, umm… you… you could be safe. 

01:12:10
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:12:10
JANINA FISHER Right? 

01:12:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah, so I think that's something I would take and I… I think I'll try and use that because you know, I think that that communication between the fight part has been the hardest one. And it's, umm… because of the power and control peace. And I think that if I did sort of say, you can be on this part you can, you know, tell me when you think it's dangerous but trust it all, you know, protect myself or if need be. Or, you know, that I'll take care of myself. 

01:12:45
JANINA FISHER Right. Or fight part stick with me here. 

01:12:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:12:50
JANINA FISHER Because if you're right… 

01:12:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:12:55
JANINA FISHER …I need your strength to deal with the situation. 

01:13:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:13:00
JANINA FISHER And then I'm, and then you're actually much… much… much… much safer. 

01:13:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:13:05
JANINA FISHER Umm… If you, you have to fight part has your back, you know… 

01:13:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:13:10
JANINA FISHER …that's pretty special. 

01:13:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, it all makes a lot of sense. 

01:13:15
JANINA FISHER Yeah. So that's the fight part. Does the fight part feel like this is making sense? 

01:13:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. And I still has a (inaudible ) trying to figure it out but umm… 

01:13:26
JANINA FISHER Of course, and… and let's reassure the fight part. We're not asking the fight part to resign away control. 

01:13:35
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:13:40
JANINA FISHER This… these are ideas for how the two of you can work better together. 

01:13:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:13:45
JANINA FISHER Because if the, if you're struggling both of you lose energy. 

01:13:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah, it's… it's feeling okay, let's open to it so… 

01:13:55
JANINA FISHER That feels… that's huge. 

01:14:00
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… Yeah. 

01:14:00
JANINA FISHER And… and so here let me tell you one of my pet peeves which the fight part will like. 

01:14:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:14:05
JANINA FISHER Umm… I feel like fight parts get, umm… stigmatized, you know, they get they're kind of the victims of… of a certain kind of… of, you know, racist, homophobic, you know, prejudice. Umm… They're… because they're treated like they're… like they're, you know, assassins rather than treated as protectors. 

01:14:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. Definitely. 

01:14:40
JANINA FISHER You know, it would be like, you know, sending Obama Secret Service to jail, who had hospitalizing Obama's Secret Service because they wouldn't let him get out of the car. 

01:14:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. Now it's… it's true and I've faced a lot of that, you know… 

01:15:00
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:15:00
UNKNOWN …stigma and, you know, ideas about what my fight part means when we really have no clue what it's really what it's motives are they only see how it's acting and take it as completely negative and not helpful. 

01:15:20
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:15:20
UNKNOWN When, you know, especially as a recently I've realized how helpful it really has been and how much it has saved me in situations. And you know, I'm coming to really respect my fight part and that part and everybody. Umm… But I have definitely have come across a lot of, you know, negative ideas about my fight part. 

01:15:50
JANINA FISHER So I just want to say, umm… very… very briefly, I just want to underscore what (inaudible ) is saying about how, having her suicidal behavior and… and certain… certainly with that was true of her substance abuse too, labeled in pejorative ways. Umm… In the case of suicidal behavior many appeal to have attention seeking, borderline that those approaches didn't work and they don't work. And I… I think any of us simply… simply we could do a little experiment with ourselves. You know, think of some habit that you would like to break or change into yourself. And if you say, I hate that habit, I hate it, uh… you can feel the tension in your body. And uh… a kind of, you know, it's funny because I can it's almost like I can feel myself tensing as if against something. And… and if I say instead "Oh, that behavior must be trying to help me. I have a whole different body experience." And uh… and suddenly what felt very tense a moment ago feels very relaxed. So umm… so those think it if you use if I'm, if I were called attention seeking, uh… I would… I would verbalize against it. If I were told I was being manipulative, uh… I'd feel hurt or I'd feel angry. Those approaches don't work and (inaudible ) is really a poster child. Umm… she now only had three sessions. And… and already there has been a turnaround in her unsafe behavior. Okay, let's see what happens next. Right. And… and I think… I think your, though, your loyalty and you're backing of the fight part is really important. 

01:18:25
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:18:30
JANINA FISHER And… and it often gets a lot, you know, when you're literally fighting with your fight part for your life. It… it becomes more negative than adversarial. 

01:18:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:18:40
JANINA FISHER But so I think the border you can thank your fight part, remember that it's… it's aims are… are always positive. 

01:18:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:18:55
JANINA FISHER They're always honorable. 

01:18:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:18:55
JANINA FISHER Uh… I think that will make a huge… when, you know, it's just like with a therapist. 

01:19:00
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:19:05
JANINA FISHER If the therapist is always negative well, you know, I think, you know, what the one we both hate, this is just attention getting. 

01:19:15
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. That's the best one. 

01:19:15
JANINA FISHER Right. Right. So I don't know whose theory it was, but I do wanna kill that person. 

01:19:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:19:20
JANINA FISHER Umm… Yeah, so you know, so you know, that when people come up with negative ideas like that, immediately you don't trust them. 

01:19:35
UNKNOWN Right. I have completely shut down and I and I still do it this point if someone tries the time that I'm seeking attention with, you know, the way I am acting out and using our self harm or suicidal ideation or even attempts. It's been, I do believe if my body literally shuts down when I hear that. And it totally makes me against whoever said that and not willing to listen any more and because, you know, it doesn't… With people who I hear that from I feel like there's… they're not open minded about it and that they think that this is why when I believe everybody's reasons behind doing that things that they do or can be completely different and opposite. 

01:20:25
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:20:25
UNKNOWN And umm… yeah, I… I literally physically cannot speak… 

01:20:30
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

01:20:30
UNKNOWN …and open up any more to a person that I hear that from and it's sad because I've heard it so much. 

01:20:40
JANINA FISHER (inaudible ) right. 

01:20:41
UNKNOWN And, you know… 

01:20:41
JANINA FISHER Yes, that's why I get so… so… so upset about it because when people have that theory, you know, when mental health professionals have that theory, they stop listening to the patient. 

01:21:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:21:00
JANINA FISHER And uh… so, you know, I just I… I've been wanting to ask you this question. 

01:21:10
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… 

01:21:10
JANINA FISHER Umm… in the years that that you were in not in the hospitals for an extended period of time but in and out. 

01:21:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:21:20
JANINA FISHER Umm… Was there any, umm… program or a particular kind of… of therapist or staff member that… that helped? 

01:21:35
UNKNOWN Umm… 

01:21:40
JANINA FISHER Either or either you are the fight part? 

01:21:45
UNKNOWN If there's been somebody else like a mental professional has helped, umm… it's over because I wanna say their husband. Umm… But I, you know, it… it does seem like there's always one person that I feel okay, with that I feel okay to talk to in a hospital setting be it a nurse or a social worker or a doctor, you know, it doesn't matter. There's always one person that seems to get it and seems to not have that close minded idea, umm… and not treat me like I'm not human. Umm… But I… I will say that, most of them, you know, I don't feel like they understand and I feel like, they're judging me most of the time. And that sad to think that I've, you know, I hate to say, I've… I've been in and out of hospitals over the years, and you know, at different points. And I've been to a lot of different hospitals and different programs and different places. Umm… You know, but I… I do believe that there needs to be a lot more work done around mental health just in general just because there's that ideas still floating around there, so much. 

01:23:10
JANINA FISHER Yes. 

01:23:15
UNKNOWN And umm… but when I do find that one person, that seems to get it or I get a sense like, you know, they're not judging me for doing what I did or feeling the way I'm feeling. Umm… 

01:23:25
JANINA FISHER Like there's somebody on my side here. 

01:23:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, and I sort of gravitate towards them and open up more to them than anyone else. And I'm glad I've had those people along the way. And, you know, some of them, you know, I've never got their name they were just a nurse passing through… 

01:23:40
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

01:23:40
UNKNOWN …or, you know, a social worker there for 10 minutes. 

01:23:45
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

01:23:45
UNKNOWN But, you know, I'm grateful for those people. And umm… you know, sometimes I wish I would have gotten their name so I can thank them in some way. 

01:23:55
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

01:23:55
UNKNOWN Umm… But you know, I've it's hard to find those people. Umm… I do feel like recently it's gotten somewhat better like past couple years, maybe it's just where I've been or, you know, I don't know. A lot of… 

01:24:10
JANINA FISHER But that… Yeah. 

01:24:10
UNKNOWN You know, it doesn't seem as stigmatized as it used to be I guess and first, you know, if you replace. 

01:24:20
JANINA FISHER Right. Well, it's… it's about it's about models changing. 

01:24:25
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:24:30
JANINA FISHER And that very blaming model is an old model but unfortunately, umm… everyone got trained in it. And it's a model that has persisted of kind of gets handed down through the generations. 

01:24:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. 

01:24:45
JANINA FISHER Yeah. Anybody the fight part of her liked in the hospital? 

01:24:50
UNKNOWN Umm… Don't think so. Umm… okay, I won't go anymore, right now. 

01:25:00
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

01:25:00
UNKNOWN Fight part always just wanted out, you know, that was the part that was like I want out of here I don't wanna be here anymore. 

01:25:05
JANINA FISHER Mm-hmm. 

01:25:05
UNKNOWN And it's the persistent part that would… that would get me out, you know, that would be able to convince somebody I was okay to go. 

01:25:15
JANINA FISHER Right. And that's you're going up with normal lifestyle. And that's another thing to talk over with the fight part. Umm… Next time it's says, "Okay, this is the answer. I got it." Umm… Is does the fight part, uh… is the fight part tired of hospitals and doctors and… and people who put you down? 

01:25:45
UNKNOWN Very. 

01:25:45
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

01:25:45
UNKNOWN And honestly, I think that's what keeps me, you know, there's a part of it that keeps me from acting on the users that I have does have harm or use overdosing on suicidal ideation. Umm… You know, there's I'm sorry I lost my chain. Umm… It's… Gosh, remind me what I was saying. 

01:26:10
JANINA FISHER Yeah. You were saying there is that side of you that… that always that actually has a lot of perspective. And… and… and knows that the end result will not just be a relief. 

01:26:35
UNKNOWN Right. So you know, it knowing that I'm gonna end up in a hospital setting like I know too well. Sometimes that keeps me from acting on that urges, but then other times kind of is it makes it scary because I don't ask for help because I… I know… 

01:27:00
JANINA FISHER Because the fight part won't let you. 

01:27:00
UNKNOWN Because it won't let me because it knows that there's people that don't understand me and don't, you know, that do have those old ideas still and that… it keeps me from accepting help and asking for help when it is serious enough to need it. 

01:27:20
JANINA FISHER Right. You know, (inaudible ) says something very important here. She says, it's different just having a name for the suicidal and self destructive behavior. She didn't say other than attention seeking, manipulative or border line. Umm… But she says, it's… it's helped me to have a name, to have a way that, you know, what I, the way I describe it to myself and to clients is. It brings us into relationship with that behavior or that part or that ideation. Right. So it's a way for her instead of identifying and getting caught up in these strong impulses to fight which really means destroy the enemy except they get turned on our own bodies. That… that's very different than, oh… that's the fight part the fight part is up in arms today. And then the first question that comes to me, I wonder what the fight part is so worried about. And, you know, years ago I can't remember how many now probably about 10 years ago, uh… as a consultant to a state hospital in Massachusetts I tried out this model with our very… very first test client. Umm… and the support of some of the staff on her team, who because of the extreme risk that her behavior put her in and the extreme risk that the staff were in because she also, uh… was violent towards staff. Umm… Some key members of her team are willing to be taught how to work in this way. And I'll always remember our first success, she… she came to me I… I just came once a month to consult to the staff and to her briefly and some of the other patients in our study. And she came up to me and she said, "Guess what, all day long, I've been wanting to hurt myself so badly but I just keep saying that's just the fight part… that's just the fight part… that's just the fight part. I just say it over and over and then I say and I don't have to do what it says." And that was her first victory over a goodness, probably, a 20 year history of cutting and suicide attempts. So umm… let's go on. And that's that provides with this… this is the new idea that I wanna encourage you to try. We're gonna ask the fight part what it thinks too. 

01:30:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:30:35
JANINA FISHER Because if you think …so if you think so I'm crazy well, I have to get back to the drawing boards. But I'm thinking umm… why not, why not… it… it's feels like the struggle for control of the impulse. Just is very exhausting to you and the fight part. 

01:31:10
UNKNOWN Very much so. 

01:31:10
JANINA FISHER And the… and the having to go back to the hospital for… for safety… 

01:31:15
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:31:20
JANINA FISHER …umm… pisses the fight part off. 

01:31:20
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:31:25
JANINA FISHER And it doesn't make you feel confident. 

01:31:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:31:25
JANINA FISHER Right. Makes you feel like I… I failed. 

01:31:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:31:35
JANINA FISHER And so I… I really think that the answer is around. Asking the fight part to give you a chance to prove that actually you are capable of riding the feelings, umm… you know, taking more time to get relief that you're not at a place where you need that instant relief. 

01:32:05
UNKNOWN Right. Yeah. 

01:32:10
JANINA FISHER And so it's… so that it not so much a struggle about, you know, do it don't do it, do it don't do it, it's more like, look, the only way I can prove to you that I can do this is to do it. Please give me a chance to prove to you that I can get relief too and I'm not so weak that I did it yesterday. 

01:32:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah, that sounds like you could work. 

01:32:45
JANINA FISHER Mm-hmm. I mean, I think it's all about the relationship… 

01:32:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:32:50
JANINA FISHER …that you and the fight part establish. 

01:32:55
UNKNOWN Right. Yeah. 

01:32:55
JANINA FISHER And I think… I think the more you agree with the fight part, I mean, I could imagine. The… or my fight part I can imagine saying, you know, I can't why you think I'm too weak to do it. 

01:33:05
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:33:10
JANINA FISHER But I… so I had a proof to you that I can. 

01:33:15
UNKNOWN Yeah… yeah. I mean, even just acknowledging that it's there has been I don't… I don't have any way to describe it. It's been, it's been helpful, umm… more than I thought it would be. Umm… And when I first started acknowledging the parts and learning about the parts, umm… it the fight part, you know, did improve even in just knowing about the parts because it was being acknowledged. 

01:33:45
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:33:45
UNKNOWN And so I think that idea of, you know, asking it to let me prove myself to it, you know, it's still trying to trust me because when I first started acknowledging they did not trust me. 

01:33:55
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:34:00
UNKNOWN Umm… And it made that very well-known but it slowly as I keep acknowledging it as I keep saying even just saying fight part, you know, it's like it has a name now, I gave it a name. 

01:34:10
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:34:15
UNKNOWN And it's… it's gotten better I'm not, you know, getting these angry bursts out of nowhere, and you know, not knowing what to do with it but rather just saying, I'm angry, what part is this. You know, I'm just saying I'm angry and knowing that it's the fight part that goes along with that as help to decrease it faster. 

01:34:35
JANINA FISHER And being willing to hear why it's bad. 

01:34:40
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:34:40
JANINA FISHER …rather than just, you know, just whenever ignore it. 

01:34:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:34:45
JANINA FISHER That's also very big thing. 

01:34:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:34:45
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

01:34:50
UNKNOWN So it's been how cool just to have a name. 

01:34:50
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

01:34:50
UNKNOWN And I think that that could work, you know, to let me prove myself to it. 

01:34:55
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

01:35:00
UNKNOWN And also I think let it know that I'll ask for its help if I need it. 

01:35:05
JANINA FISHER Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes, I can just see… I can see what a strong… strong team you're gonna be. 

01:35:15
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:35:15
JANINA FISHER You know, watch out people, here they come. 

01:35:20
UNKNOWN We're trying. 

01:35:25
JANINA FISHER Oh, well, thank you so much for battling the traffic to get here. 

01:35:30
UNKNOWN Of course, not it was, I really enjoyed it and I, you know, I'm honored to be a part of it. You know, anything that can help anyone that struggling the same that I have or in me well, that can, anything that can help. 

01:35:45
JANINA FISHER Right, Right. And… and absolutely and you and your fight part are… are really symbolic of… of what happens when you get the right help. 

01:35:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:36:00
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

01:36:00
UNKNOWN Yes. Thank you. 

01:36:00
JANINA FISHER You're welcome. To be continued. 

01:36:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:36:05
JANINA FISHER Yes. 

01:36:10
JANINA FISHER So umm… this session with (inaudible ) did not cover a lot of new ground. But what it did, it's… it's served a number of purposes I think that were important for her. One is that it allowed her to be a spokesperson on behalf of clients like herself. And… and to not only say out loud but also to… to symbolize how a different paradigm can stabilize and offer a new… new opportunities, that she wasn't attention getting or manipulative. Umm… And… and certainly if by borderline we mean bad she certainly wasn't bad. So it gave her a lot of pride to be able to speak from the place that she is now. And the other important thing which we don't, I don't think we prize highly enough in… in our therapy training and therefore, in our in our work. We had the opportunity to reinforce and repeat. In many of the themes that have come up in other consultation sessions, we… I think undervalue the importance of repetition. Just think attachment status is built, uh… baby, literally, baby step by baby step, uh… moment by moment. It isn't one day the baby is born and then the next day he/she has to cure attachment. Umm… So this is a process and when we're changing the brain as the experts in neural plasticity test there is very… very important to repeat over and over and over again. Umm… The same patterns, the same interventions, the same language, uh… so that it actually has a chance to encode. Umm… Rick Hanson, uh… whose newest book is called Hardwiring for Happiness, umm… really makes that point. He says the brain has a preference for negative stimuli. Uh… He calls this the negativity bias. We process negative experiences faster than positive. So if both occur on the same day, the negative experience is going to be in memory first. Uh… So repetition is extremely… extremely important. It encodes memories or deeply.
