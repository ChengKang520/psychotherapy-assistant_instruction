MICHELLE DODD I think that umm… teens are commonly discriminated because (inaudible ), me being a heavyset person, I’ve always been like discriminated, no one called names. I mean, but it doesn’t affect them sometimes, but sometimes I feel that I have low self-esteem and it hurts my feelings. 

00:00:30
STUART MUSZYNSKI How do teens cope with discrimination because of their weight, find out on Principles.

00:01:00
STUART MUSZYNKSI Hi, welcome to Principles. I’m Stuart Muszynski and I am joined today by my co-host Roger Sidoti, by Deanna Harris from the Girl Scouts, by George Alderdice who has his own story of losing 500 pounds and by Brandon who was discriminated in middle school because of his weight. Brandon, can you tell us your story? 

00:01:20
BRANDON HOOD Well, it all started really back when I was younger in middle school or so this six-grade umm… its… kids made fun of me every day for what I ate, how I ran on the playground, what I did. Umm… There were days where I would come home in tears umm… you know asking questions of like why I had to be this way, umm… you know why I was so big, why people had to say the things they said and you know still to this day, as a senior high school, I still get those… those select few people who just don’t accept it and don’t see who I really am and just kind of look at me as a large can and they still say those things and it doesn’t bother me as much now umm… I kind of had a phase when I was about… just about entering high school that I just kind of said you know, I’m gonna be me and, if people don’t like me and they want to say things about me, you know go right ahead, but it’s not gonna affect me and you know, you just have to push through and that’s what I did and its… its better now for me. I have tons of friends who respect me for the person that I am, not for how I look and I think that’s one of the most important things. 

00:02:30
STUART MUSZYNSKI Host, Founder of Project Love And when you were in middle school, when you say it was the worst, how did you cope then? 

00:02:40
BRANDON HOOD Umm… The only way I coped was really coming home and just crying to my mom and to my dad and just that… there was nothing I could, there’s nothing else I could do. Umm… 

00:02:50
STUART MUSZYNSKI And what did you parents say you do? 

00:02:50
BRANDON HOOD They, you know… they just told me that I had to just black it out. Let them say what they want to say. You know they might say stuff now, but you know later on in life they’re gonna realize what they said and they’re gonna realize what they did was wrong and as much as I wanted to listen to that and be like you know you’re right, it just hurt. It hurt to hear what people had to say about me and to hear what… you know people actually really thought about me. 

00:03:15
STUART MUSZYNSKI Did your school make any effort to do anything? 

00:03:15
BRANDON HOOD Umm… The teachers did see it going on and they… they said things to the students that were doing it, but umm… you know kids are gonna be kids, you know students… you know do it and teachers can do what they can to stop it, but outside of the classroom in the halls is really where it happens and when it happens and there’s nothing that the teachers are gonna be able to do about that and you know I would… I would talk to teachers about it and they would do what they could, but they really didn’t help us much as I think it should have. 

00:03:45
STUART MUSZYNSKI Yeah, when you say they would do what they could, what… what would they do? They would just talk to the… would they individually talk to the kids or would they talk to the class, with the principal get involved? 

00:03:55
BRANDON HOOD Well, most of the time it was like a class discussion about umm… you know ways to respect and treat people like correctly, not to you know talk to… talk down about people and not to say mean or nasty things about them. Umm… It wasn’t really a… a single a person that talk to them individually about it, which I think probably would have been the better way of doing it, but you know it worked for… for whether… you know for whether it was it worked and you know I just kind… kind of let it go and just kept going along. 

00:04:25
STUART MUSZYNSKI But then when they were out of the classroom they would resume? 

00:04:25
BRANDON Yeah. It was like instantaneous like, after the talk I was you know feeling kind of good they like maybe you know maybe somebody would stop it, maybe you know, but one person that I fear seeing in halls will say anything and you know we would walk out of class and there it was right there, but not even two feet out of classroom. I feared again and then I you know hear the derogatory comments and all that stuff and it just felt like everything was in vain like nothing was going to work. 

00:04:50
STUART MUSZYNSKI Before we take a look at why this is happening, we want to take a look at a clip of what two other teens told us. 

00:04:55
MICHELLE DODD I started off at a age of about 11. In fifth grade, I was teased about my weight and I was commonly teased by smaller girls in my classroom about my weight. So starts early on in a elementary age, and then it goes further on and its common from elementary to junior high high school that teens are discriminated because that are a weight. 

00:05:20
Maybe from when I was five to about seventh grade, I was very obese. I wasn’t treated so well. Like even through elementary kids are really cruel to kids that aren’t so skinny, kids that don’t quite fit the perfect mould or the perfect child, kids like you know can’t run as fast, can’t do things as well as other kids umm… and about six, seventh grade, I started getting that pressure of, you know you’ve got to lose weight, you’ve got to look perfect, you’ve got to… you know change to fit the standard because you’re not fitting it and you’re not gonna be well liked like this. 

00:06:00
STUART MUSZYNSKI I know Michelle is with us here, Michelle’s one of the teens who commented about her prior discrimination. How are things now Michelle for you? 

00:06:10
MICHELLE DODD It… It goes on. I mean it’s a never ending thing even in your adult life. 

00:06:15
STUART MUSZYNSKI And why do you think people do this? 

00:06:15
MICHELLE DODD I think they do it because, I mean it’s just a common display of ignorance. It’s a common display of ignorance, they don’t know, know better, they lack the knowledge of how a person’s feelings are or how it must be to be in that person’s shoes, and so they don’t understand the perspective of like how they lived their life, how it will feel to be in that position and so, being that they are ignorant towards, I mean being obese or heavyset, they commonly just discriminate against you. I mean, it’s just a basic lack of understanding. 

00:06:55
STUART MUSZYNSKI Do you think that any of you, do you think that part of it is that people want to feel better about themselves and so they’re finding something that’s very obvious to put somebody else down with? 

00:07:10
BRANDON HOOD It’s like an easy target almost like, kids walk around and they see that, that bigger kid and instead of trying to pick out the little things about other people, they see you and they’re like perfect like why not? Umm… I think it may gives them inside, a sense of like pride like you know they’ve done something to hurt you that good to them that… that makes them a better person. Umm… And I think that’s just how kids operate in… in today’s society in even like when I was younger that… that made them feel better about themselves was to put somebody else down, then obvious problem with somebody else had, to point that out to them to make them feel bad about it. It was like made them a better person. 

00:07:50
STUART MUSZYNSKI Did it ever make you feel that you just couldn’t tolerate going to school anymore? 

00:07:55
BRANDON HOOD There were mornings where I woke up and I was like, I don’t wanna go. I… I know what’s gonna happen today, you know I’m gonna be made fun of for yet another day at the week and just… but I kind of said to myself that if I didn’t go and I didn’t kind of stickup for myself in a way that people would keep doing it and I would show that… and they’ll and that later affect me to that point and you know, I think honestly sticking around and kind of just letting it happen and just showing them that it wasn’t hurting me, it’s like brought me to the person that I’m as far as… it doesn’t bother me anymore. You know you can say what you wanna say to me, that’s fine. If that makes you feel better, go ahead, doesn’t hurt me anymore. 

00:08:35
STUART MUSZYNSKI Just I… Just one more question that we wanna take a quick break. Were there any friends you could point to when you were really struggling who came to your defense? 

00:08:45
BRANDON Oh yeah. I had friends umm… in middle school I had one friend, I’ll never forgot. He was a kid who was of my size, his name is George. Him and I got along great umm… he was made fun of just about, if not more as you know than me and him and I played football together and we were great friends, and both of us hung out together all the time in school, we ate lunch together everything. It was like… it was comfort in each other. We knew that the other one was dealing with what we were dealing with, so it was easier for me to go and talk to him about problems that I was having with certain students because chances were that he was having the same problems with them. 

00:09:20
STUART MUSZYNSKI Okay. So, we’re gonna talk about how the media actually does influence the image that we have of ourselves and other people, that perfect body image. What’s that perfect body image? Deanna, do you have any experience based on the Girl Scouts? 

00:09:35
DEANNA HARRIS Girl Scouts Yes and the one thing well working with young ladies is that there is no perfect body image. What they see on the videos and in the magazines, we have to remind children that though they’re airbrushed umm… they’re paid to look like that, they have trainers all the time and one thing about Girl Scouts, we are organization, we help girls grow strong and the thing is we have to start on the inside, we have to start with the girl herself working on how she feels about herself and what is her image, what is her style, what does she look good in, before she starts to look at all the magazines and… and working… and working and looking at the videos, really feeling a… confident about who she is as a… as a young woman. 

00:10:20
STUART MUSZYNSKI So how is it possible, if you’re overweight and somebody is discriminating against you every day as they did with Brandon, as they did with Michelle? How is it possible to have that right self image? How do you get there? 

00:10:40
DEANNA HARRIS It’s not always easy. It’s not always easy when you’re always under attack. The thing is when we say we’re working from the inside out, talk to your parents, talk to your counselors, talk to your teachers, become a part of organization. We want… we… As young women we want you to feel good about who you are and then may even start with noting how to eat healthy, learning how to… to work out, learning being with people who will support your dreams, or support who you are and like you for just who you are, so you could go out into the world and be the person you wanna be and also, it’s about to when you learn how to feel good about yourself, no matter what size you’re, when you learn how to walk with your head up high it’s hard for people to attack you. 

00:11:25
STUART MUSZYNSKI I just want to turn to the… to the teens who have not necessarily been discriminated against, but you guys have seen this in your halls. Can you… Can you tell us one, have you done anything to stop that, two, what would you recommend somebody like Brandon or Michelle? What would you recommend to them? 

00:11:40
I think that parents as well as friends need to stress the fact that your weight and everything else like just how you look isn’t what’s most important that its important how you act and how you are and just that it’s not… that’s not the most important thing that like just your appearance isn’t the most important thing and you need to teach kids that would be saying these things to overweight kids that… that’s not that you need to teach them that’s not the most important thing either because that’s what they’re stressing that it’s like horrible thing to be obese or overweight or whatever they’re saying about the kids. 

00:12:20
And that’s the thing it isn’t stressed enough like these people watch TV all the time and they’ll always see what their standards should be and it’s not so much, it’s not stressed enough that, it doesn’t matter to like how overweight you’re, it’s like what you do about it and if you’re trying to make yourself fit in by joining groups and talking and becoming friends with other people. 

00:12:50
MICHELLE DODD But a common misconception that people have is that like family members are… a help to somebody’s teens. Sometimes when teens are discriminated against, it’s against their own parents. 

00:13:00
STUART MUSZYNSKI But is it… is it now one of the last frontiers of people feeling that it is appropriate to discriminate against somebody for their weight? 

00:13:10
ROGER SIDOTI Co-host, High School Principal Stuart, I would… I would hope that’s true, but I… I like human nature suggest that once we conquer the discrimination against body image that something else will come up and people be discriminative. I… I… listening to our kids here today its… they certainly are getting a lot of mixed messages, you know the messages from the media, messages from parents, messages from friends umm… I think that we all play a role in… in trying to help young people when they do feel that they’re being harassed because of their body image. I think we all play a role in… in taking you know some real direct action in… in working with people who are doing the harassment and I think that they need to have hope. What… What I think it happens in… no matter what we’re discriminated against, really what… what people who do the discriminating, they wanna take hope away, they wanna take away from Brandon that he could be a very successful… whatever you wanted to be. You know they take hope away from you know based on… on their vision and so I think that it’s up to us… to stand as… as… as adults, stand in a way that we’re gonna continue to give young people hope, regardless of what their body image is. 

00:14:20
STUART MUSZYNSKI Well, its… its… it seems to me that all these stories that we’ve heard today; Brandon story, Michelle story, George’s story, you’re dealing with self starters, who basically pushed away the negatives through the force of their own conviction and their personality and said, I’m not gonna be a victim anymore and I’m gonna be who I am. Well what about the despondent, depressed, down dragging kid who can’t stick up for themselves or herself or who chooses, yeah I know that being of victim is sometimes a choice, but who remains the victim? How do we help those kids? Any of us. 

00:15:00
They help some of the kids like just by talking to them see how do they feel, being a friend, just doing a lot for them, not just treat them different because there are that way, but just be there for them when they need you, help them out even though they might not need the help and they might not want us still do it for them anyway. 

00:15:20
JERRICA SWEETNICH I know that my sister used to be overweight and she would really have problems with kids at school. They would make fun of her all the time and do all that and she would just come home and the best thing that we could do we just sit there and talk to her about it because my sister is an awesome person and I love her and I never understood why people would make fun of her just because the way she looked, that’s not who she really is. 

00:15:40
To order a videotape of PRINICIPLES 1-866-517-1211 

00:15:40
STUART MUSZYNSKI And was it difficult for your sister to come home and to identify with you or was that not difficult. 

00:15:50
JERRICA SWEETNICH That wasn’t so difficult because me and my sister we were close like we were able to talk about that. She would always give me compliments and I would always give her compliments and you know when she would talk about you know Jerrica you are not bigger or anything I would say well you know you can come and take a walk with me or we will go and do that kind of stuff. It wasn’t really hard because I’m not the type of person that’s going to sit there and make fun of her. So it wasn’t that hard. 

00:16:20
EBONY SALES I like had the same problem because my sister was a toothpick and obviously I’m not… and we were in competition with each other like who is prettier because she was… she was prettier, but then as like as I grew up, I like came to the conclusion like look I’m pretty either way anyway I’m beautiful and you need to accept then it’s like I had a lot of discrimination from my sister because she was in so much competition with me. 

00:16:45
STUART MUSZYNSKI Well once again we are getting… we are getting to… you came to that conclusion on your own. Are there ways that schools can help kids come to that conclusion? I mean are counselors equipped to do this, I have no idea? 

00:17:00
ROGER SIDOTI I think that they… they are. I think they are equipped to do it. I think that part of the problem that we sometimes run into schools is that we aren’t sensitive enough to identify. You know students will quietly suffer in silence and… and sometimes we need to be proactive and… and that’s tough to do Stuart you know. It’s kind of hard… it… I use Ebony as an example it will be hard for me to step up to Ebony and say Ebony how… how… how are you doing? How are kids treating you because you are… are a larger person? But you know what we need to be able to do that in that sense those are the types of things that I think that… that’s at open communications and I think young people they… they respect open communications. I think they respect people who reach out to them to try to do those things. 

00:17:45
In the middle school we are so looking for a path then I think losing weight if they are heavyset, they are being judged by their peers and it’s terrible, how people that are so young have to say… say like fit in the trend and if they don’t they feel left out and it’s not fare to them. 

00:18:05
STUART MUSZYNSKI Brandon, I just want to turn to you if you don’t fit the trend, what’s the consequence? You get depressed? Do you start eating again? 

00:18:15
BRANDON HOOD Well, I don’t know it’s… I never really had a problem with fitting the trend, but I do see it like with people that are my size that in high school like there needs to be like a certain way that you look and if you don’t then like that’s terrible, that’s like the worst thing in the world and I see, I had a friend who was overweight and she… she felt like she was disgusting, that’s how she felt about herself and she… she talked about suicide and that’s like that’s terrible. I didn’t even like know what to say her about that, it was… it’s like you know… 

00:18:55
STUART MUSZYNSKI So she was depressed as a result of that. 

00:18:55
BRANDON HOOD Oh yeah, she was extremely depressed about you know nowadays you see shows everywhere and then like on TV, I know there is a show on MTV called I Want A Famous Face. It’s about like not liking the way you are and getting plastic surgery and the lots of it to look like a famous person and I think that to me that’s disgusting that’s… that’s terrible. Why would you want to change everything about you just to look like somebody who is in the media all the time? Like you know with… with people like that and with people who you know are overweight, they just there is so much pressure on people like me that are overweight that you know don’t fit the trend that everyone talks about and you know she… she slipped into a depression that kind of like made her feel like there was no use for her to be here and she talked about suicide, thank God she never you know went through and tried to do anything about it, but she talked about suicide and that was like, it… it totally confused me. 

00:19:55
ROGER SIDOTI Brandon was the school involved at all? Were you able to talk to your fellow teachers to whom you can go someone that… 

00:20:00
BRANDON HOOD Yes. I talked to… Yeah, I talked to a teacher about it, he mentioned something about it and then you know a lot of other people be involved, some other of her friends got involved as we were talking to her about it and I think after hearing a lot of the what people had to say to her about you know how… you know… you know don’t listen to the people and she started getting involved in things that she was good at and that she liked and finding those people that were also in that group. 

00:20:25
STUART MUSZYNSKI And she felt better about herself. 

00:20:25
BRANDON HOOD Yeah. She got involved in band and she is a very good… she plays (inaudible ) I think, very good at what she does. So now she is… she is got to know all those people in band and then that group and those are now all of her new friends that don’t look at her for how she looks. They look at her because she is a musician, she is good at what she does and you know that’s something that I think is the most important is like I found a niche in my swimming and singing, I love both and so I did it and I find those people that have the same interests as me and they might be a third of my size, but they saw the same interests. We find common ground, we talk about it and that… that really helps me and helped her to get through a lot of it.

ROGER SIDOTI George is this an adult does this ring with you at all and your issues with the weight? 

00:21:10
GEORGE ALDERDICE This is, it’s really home(ph). Unfortunately with American side everybody wants to fit in we can sit here and say we don’t. You know we are going along our own path, but we wanna fit in and when you don’t fit in when you have people constantly looking at you. For example when I was in the grocery store buying you know I would have people looking in my cart to see what I would buy, you know just looking over on the shoulder and that type of stuff and God forbid, I ever went to fast food restaurant and you know I would hear things from the people as I’m driving out that people giving me my food. 

00:21:40
ROGER SIDOTI You know it’s interesting for the young people you know I sometimes think we look at young people and we think they are so cruel to one another. They’ve learned it somewhere, cruelty is learned from the adults that are around them. 

00:21:55
GEORGE ALDERDICE And like I said I mean I would even till this day I do not like eating in front of people. 

00:22:00
DEANNA HARRIS We… We need to do a better job. We need to pay attention. We need to listen, we also need to choose our words more carefully and we do need to help our teenagers find their niche. You know I think that is very important that’s one of the things that through our organization that we do. Let’s help you find that thing that you are great at, that thing that you can excel at, but as adult sometimes we get so caught up in our own thing or when we were younger this is how it was and not really listening to the concerns because it has to be a terrible thing to everyday go to school and to have someone talk about you and to you know to discriminate you and you feel that you cannot defend yourself, there is nowhere to go, there is nowhere to hide and you go home and you hear some of the same things. You know like why you are eating that or push back from the table. We need as adults, we need to be a little more proactive in helping our… our teenagers, helping our children to… to find their niche, to feel better about who they are and to help them fight. You know to help them fight against discrimination. You know getting the… you know the principals and the teachers and the counselors involved in this… in this issue because it’s not something that you should have to face by yourself. 

00:23:15
ROGER SIDOTI I think we… we set a standard as adults and… and it’s time that we clean up our act, I agree. 

00:23:25
STUART MUSZYNSKI We are gonna go to the audience and see what the audience has to say. 

00:23:30
This is (inaudible ) from Michelle and Brandon. (inaudible ) a lot of times when teenagers of your age talk about you is that something maybe going on their home or something could be wrong with them and they get satisfaction about talking about (inaudible ). They feel better about their selves by being (inaudible ). So, thank you all for being on the show and show others that obese that is okay and feeling good about this so. 

00:23:50
Okay, I have two questions. The first question is I know how Brandon say when he was being teased or whatever he was able to talk to somebody, where do other people go when they don’t have that type of access to somebody? What… What are they supposed to do? 

00:24:05
BRANDON HOOD I think it’s really important like I said before to find something that you’re good at, that you like to do, that you have a passion for and really pursue that and get into that and find other people who enjoy the same things because that really I think people who are with you in the same ideas and same umm… you know likes and dislikes can really you know find something about you other than just the way you look. For me it was definitely getting into sports. I loved swimming, diving, tennis and I played those sports and the people that I played them with you know they didn’t look at me as the fat kid on the team. They looked at me as just another member of the team and I got to know them and they got to know me as somebody other than just the overweight kid. I was more to them. I was a tennis player, I was a swimmer and that was a huge you know step for me, you know stepping outside of that… that safety zone and being able to meet those people and realizing that that’s what I wanted to do and I think that is the most important is to find that one thing that you love to do and really meet those people and get into that… that one thing. 

00:25:15
Okay and the next question is to Michelle and Brandon. Knowing that people teased you and you were harassed or whatever and that hurt you didn’t that make you wanna just lose weight just for yourself, just to respect, just to had a respect for yourself and self-esteem? 

00:25:30
MICHELLE DODD Personally I think there is nothing wrong with me and so I mean I like the way I am, I feel good about myself every time I wake up. There is nothing wrong with me just because you are smaller than me does that make you different? If we both feel good about ourselves then I mean there is no reason for me to have… to have to lose weight or to portray somebody else’s body image. I think I was created the way I should be. There is not nothing on me that’s wrong. So, why I should not be happy about the way that I’m? 

00:26:05
STUART MUSZYNSKI Thanks for watching. Thanks everyone for commenting. 

00:26:10
We all need to get to know each other for who we are, not just what we look like. Being a good friend can make an incredible difference in someone’s life. We all have the power to respect our peers and ourselves. Thank you for watching.
