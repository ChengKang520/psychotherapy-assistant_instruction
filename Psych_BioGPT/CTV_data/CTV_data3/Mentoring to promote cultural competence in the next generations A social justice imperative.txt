HELEN NEVILLE Good afternoon, everyone. How're you doing so far? You enjoying? 

00:00:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:00:20
HELEN NEVILLE All right. Okay. Well, I'm just so pleased and honored to introduce one of the most renowned psychologists today, Dr Puncky Heppner. I'll just say his full formal name P – Paul Heppner, as we know him in the literature, holds a curator's professorship, the highest distinction at the University of Missouri and directs the Coalition for cultural competencies in organization he co-founded in 1998. His research focuses on how people cope with stressful life problems across different cultural groups in the U.S. as well as in other countries including crossing national boundaries and developing cross cultural competencies. He has published no less than over 200 articles and books chapters, nine books. He's made hundreds of presentations and national conferences and delivered over 70 invited international presentations across 14 countries. Dr Heppner is the recipients of three Fulbright awards. He's a fellow in three Divisions of A.P.A, 17, 45, and 52, as well as the American Psychological Society. He has served on national international editorial board including the Editor of The Counseling Psychologist. And in 2005 and 2006, he served as President of the Society of Counseling Psychology, Division 17 in A.P.A. And not surprisingly in 2009, he received the Leona Tyler Award which is the Society's highest award. He's also the recipient of numerous other awards for his leadership, research, teaching, mentoring, international work, and promoting social justice and diversity issues. And so I always like to insert a little bit of a personal piece too, when I make introductions. So I can say that I've known Puncky, my entire career. First, of course, through his wonderful set of writings and his, as well as his editorship of the counseling psychologist, second, as a major leader in developing counseling psychology across national boundaries. His work and that of others was so impactful that this year Division 17 Society of Counseling Psychology inaugurated its first ever vice president of, for international affairs. So as you can see, Dr Heppner's reach goes all around the world and then back again, as they like to say in "The Hobbit". And then finally, I came to know Puncky personally, when he served as a consultant to my program some years ago, when we were having some really, really difficult conflicts to overcome. I'll never forget Puncky's impact on me personally regarding the critical role of leadership that is as a leader, if you find that you've even unknowingly walked into the middle of a terrible situation, one that's not of your admission necessarily, you're still responsible to deal with all the fallout, particularly, its impact on all individuals under your supervision and to figure out how to do so quickly, ethically, transparently and with integrity. This is a lesson I learned from Puncky directly, and that I live to this day. So I'm very pleased to present Dr Heppner with the Janet E. Helms Award.

00:04:00
PUNCKY PAUL HEPPNER Thank you, so much. Thank you, Thank you so much. Umm… I, I, I add one other thing to her introduction. Uh… I retired last May. So interesting things happen to us when we retire. And umm… just hearing that memory it was like "Oh! Wow!" That's uh… reminded me of something. So thank you. Umm…it's been a very good journey. I'm, I'm deeply honored to receive this award. In other word, ceremony is later today. Uh… so I'm not going to say too much about that. Umm… but umm… I think it's just uh… it, it, this award reflects so much wisdom on the part of the people who uh… organized the roundtable now for many, many years. Uh… and I think that's very, very important because one of the first things I want to say is one of the most important things I did in my work was mentoring. Uh… and so we'll come back to that, but I just wanted to underscore the roundtable and the people here at Teachers College and I'm, I'm deeply honored to receive this award. My most, my, you know, as I look back uh… and I think about what is it that I did. Umm… I think one of the most important things was mentoring. Umm… we know there, there's a lot of data that says that mentoring is associated with uh… people's success in their career, uh… getting positions, doing well in their positions, becoming leaders in the prevent in the profession. Uh… there's a lot of data that says that. And so really underscores the importance of mentoring. Uh… in particularly for under representative groups. Umm… in many times, those individuals will be in a very new setting where their parents their ancestors have never been. And so how is it that we learn from that process mentoring? Just a couple of, of words here umm… about uh… this group. These are pretty much all of my advisees that I have worked with over the years uh… not, not quite all. Umm… but people that uh… I've been umm… very influential people in my development as well and I'll talk about that later. Umm… and I worked in just a broad, broad array of activities across this group. Just uh… I'm going to talk about Leaf bay, uh… a little bit later, new way umm… and several others – Adrian uh… Marlin received uh… an A. P A Outstanding Dissertation Award just two years ago I think it was. And my very, very first advisee uh… now Dr Lynn Reeder, who's director of the counseling. So these are some of the people. 

00:07:20

00:07:25
PUNCKY PAUL HEPPNER One of the things that uh… striking to me, I started out uh… half time in a counseling center, half time academic. Uh… I had that core. Uh… sometimes people call it joint uh… other people call it split. Uh… I experienced it more in the split way. Umm… and over time, I, I put all my time over an academic thing, but I was struck with, I was working a lot with one individual at a time in the counseling situation. And then, I started to realize all of the impact of mentoring uh… can be huge. Uh…because each of the students uh… if they have done very well and they've learned a great deal in the program, they graduate and they go out and they start working with their students. And so in that sense, we can have a very strong rippling effect, and I see that now with the people that I had on the screen earlier. So the focus of what I want to talk about is mentoring. I think this is so important. And I want to start with just talking about the sacred trust. Uh… I think the very, very core of mentoring is the sacred trust. Uh… from my experience, mentoring is, is very complicated. And some days it works well, other days it doesn't work very well. I go home and I scratch my head and I wondering "What am I doing?" Uh… for me some of the big building blocks are empathy, understanding, uh… the mentee strengths and vulnerabilities, understanding my own strengths and vulnerabilities, caring collaboration, giving and getting respect, responsibility kindness, heart and compassion. Umm… and it's also I would call it unwavering support. Uh… I will always have your back, come hell or high water. Uh… and I may not agree with what you did, but I'm going to have you back. Uh… it's helping, it's advocacy. So that is a very key kind of relationship to establish. Umm… so given that, keep this in mind and I'm going to talk a little bit about uh… mentoring in a more general way and but just for a little bit. And then, I want to talk about uh… mentoring to promote cultural competency and social justice. So that's going to be the, the majority of my talk. 

00:10:15
[sil.] 

00:10:20
PUNCKY PAUL HEPPNER You can scan these umm… I, I did just a little writing in terms of looking at uh… these what seem like key factors to me in the mentoring process. Uh… getting to know the mentee, I'll talk a little bit about that little bit later. Umm… trying to understand the mentee, their skills uh… their attitudes, uh… their goals uh… very much from the developmental process umm… providing both support, but also trying to enhance self-confidence, self-efficacy. 

00:11:00
[sil.] 

00:11:05
PUNCKY PAUL HEPPNER I have umm… very uh… I have written this out. And so if anybody wants to look at that and get more of the finer details, just shoot me an email. I've, I've tried to outline here goals and roles of a mentor and talk about content skills. Uh… somebody is wanting to go into an academic position. Okay, so what are all the skills you're gonna need in research. You know, there's research, design their stats etcetera, etcetera. Umm… it's, it's journalese, learning journalese, you get a review back, you know, Are they positive or negative or what are they trying to do? What are they telling us? So all those kind of things, but also process skills, self-efficacy, critical thinking etcetera. So I'm shooting for both of those kinds of things. Here are different roles. Umm… I engage in all of these at different times. And part of what's unique about mentoring is there's no two mentoring relationships that are the same. It slides back and forth for me. Umm… but I want to highlight this one, providing opportunities. We don't typically think of this, so much as a mentoring role or if we do not a very large role. Uh… and so I'm going to be talking a lot about this in the next section, but throughout all of this, I really want underscore that uh… sacred trust is a huge, huge issue. And when that gets damaged that's a huge problem. So I'll narrow the focus now talk about social justice, cultural competence. I believe that all of my mentees need to have cultural competencies. I didn't start out there. You know, back in 1978, I don't know if we even had the word cultural competencies, it wasn't very common uh… in our worlds. Umm… but today, it's all, all need to learn uh… knowledge awareness skills uh… in terms of how, whatever kind of job they have. But I also have come to believe that we don't learn cultural competencies merely by talking about them. Umm… it's, it's, it's, you know, after a while, we can get pretty good at talking it, but how do we do it? So one of the things that uh… Dr Helen Neville, I'm going to refer to Helen a lot. She was uh… my buddy in crime so to speak. Uh… as we kind of develop some programs and things and uh… so as we were thinking, we were, we were thinking, we need to develop and I started to call it "necessary learning opportunities". Uh… sometimes we call it "structured learning opportunities" Uh… but I like the word "necessary learning opportunities" because I think students need to have some of these learning opportunities and, and try out some things, should develop their skills. So this is kind of a departure from Levinson's uh… writing about mentoring. I put the slide here, just to illustrate. Umm… I think there's 19 graduate students here. Umm… and at this point, it's uh… Lisa Flores, who uh… kind of filled in after Helen left Missouri unfortunately. Umm… but 19 students here, all at different levels umm… most of these students uh… and, and these students were all in a multicultural practical. Uh… they would sign up for one credit and this was a volunteer, this is not a required course, 19 students and we would engage in a wide range of activities under an umbrella of a multicultural center. So we have a cultural practice in a multicultural center. Umm… and umm… the students would, would put in quite a bit of time into this practical. And so if you think about that uh… and it's totally voluntary, there were few students who had assistantships. One student signed up for seven practical in a row. Uh… so three and a half years, so was not uncommon. So we had a very good level of energy there, but I think it was more important in terms of what they were doing, and I'll talk a little about that as we go. 

00:15:45
[sil.] 

00:15:50
PUNCKY PAUL HEPPNER Part of, part of the way uh… mentoring work for me was umm… a continual process of assessing, trying to understand the mentee, trying some training opportunities, giving feedback, going back and forth. Uh… but it's very difficult to understand another person in terms of all their skills. Uh… self -report sometimes is helpful, but it's not very reliable many times. "Yeah, I can do that, no problem.", but then in reality, it doesn't work out too well. So one of the things I would do is start uh… discussing training goals and competencies in the initial interviews that uh… we would conduct, when we were looking to admit new doctoral students umm… and so I would ask them questions about what kind of things they had done? Uh… what are you thinking about? How do you see this part of your career? Uh… and looking for, you know, their level of thinking in their process and their experiences. Uh… and then discussing throughout their program uh… how, how they're developing in terms of their cultural competencies? How do they see their growing edges, biases, prejudices that kind of thing? And how does this again relate back to their career goals? So uh… and the key thing for me has been understanding the worldviews. Now on the one hand, that sounds simple, but uh… big problem is many times I don't know what I don't know. And to make it more complicated, many times the mentee doesn't know what they don't know. Uh… so we might think we're on the same page uh… we're not. Uh… or we might think we're better than we are uh… etc. So I want to give you an example of uh… one of the things that happened to me that really turned on a light bulb. no sorry Umm… I think it was hmm… 10 years ago your way, maybe longer. Uh… time kind of blends together. Umm… but it pictures the same. Marie and I, arrive in Southern Taiwan, big city of Kaohsiung. And umm… we had a fabulous seafood meal prepared by her father, must have been 27 dishes and I still feel guilty that I didn't eat enough. Umm… and umm… we, we go outside, it's dark, humid, warm, we walk down the street and I start hearing traditional Taiwanese music. And it's like "Oh! Well that's, that's really cool. I like this. It feels very good." Umm… we walk a little farther and start smelling incense. Uh… and then a huge temple comes into view. And uh… my wife says uh… after we kind of look at it and I go inside and she said "This is where my mother and I came, when we were thinking about accepting your offer to study in the U.S." I said "Wow! This is umm… uh… very, very interesting." And I learned more about the temple and her parents and, and those kind of things. We ended up, I think spending about three days there, I remember uh… visiting her grandparents, grandparents' home in a military village. And I'm like military village. I don't understand this part. And so it would be just a zillion things that would happen that way, and I would ask more and more questions at home, military religion. Now I know there's a lot of implications there umm… but also where she played as a child. Uh… and so I started having many more images and a deeper understanding of her cultural context. "Oh! Well that's, that's huge in terms of working with her as a mentee." I now have much more uh… of an understanding of where she's coming from and how she might think about something. So incredibly important for me as a mentor to learn much more about my advisees than I'd ever imagined. But like I said earlier, it's a continual process of assessing and watching. Uh… and so for instance, I can remember thinking "Oh, umm… I think would be really good if your way could have a teaching opportunity." Umm… and so then I'd say "Okay, what do, what do I need to do to have to make that happen to give her those opportunities?" Maybe it would be good if she was in a supervisory role in the multicultural center. I think that would prepare her to that kind of thing. Then I watch what happens in that process. So this continual umm… processing, assessing. So I think that's very important. Second thing that I think is very important is becoming aware of our different cultural histories. Uh… this is uh… the slide uh… the major part of it is uh… somebody distributed some cotton balls in front of our umm… center and our black cultural center at M U. Well, as you can imagine, there was a lot of implications here and what's being suggested uh… cotton slavery go back onto the farm. I mean, it could be a lot of different things being suggested here. So there was marchers, there were discussions uh… I saw Roger Worthington earlier in the Hallway. He was very involved in his leadership role in the university at that time. Umm… so umm… so one of our faculty unfortunately said something like people are just make an a mountain out of a molehill with these cotton balls. Uh… it's just one small stupid incident we should just move on and forget it. Oh! Well, in our student group uh… you could, you could just feel the fears going up. Uh… very interestingly umm… the international students, many of them, they couldn't understand what was wrong with this picture. Uh… but they could feel the fear in the other students. And so they came in very anxiously. I said "Well, let's talk, let's talk about this. There's a very important history here." But when we don't know the history, we can become quite insensitive. Uh… this photo is the oldest continuously inhabited uh… building in the U.S. It's uh… Taos Pueblo, Tennyson, Mexico umm… Marie and I live there in the summer. And umm… tremendous history and uh… there are many historical events not only here, but throughout New Mexico and what happened with the Spanish War, uh… some of you may know about Spanish Land Grants uh… basically in which they promise land who uh… people coming into New Mexico not at but the land wasn't there's and it was a ploy. Uh… so they would help fight the American Indians. So lot of things tied up here and this idea of land is huge. Umm… and so not being sensitive to that because the land grants were also about water and this has been New Mexico water is huge. We get 9 inches of rain a year. This is a huge thing. So still today, these land grants that were offered 500 years ago uh… is, it's a very, very sensitive topic. Uh… my wife and I, went to a presentation last year where there was a discussion on this and it was like "Oh, there's, there's just gas fumes all around this room." This is a potential for explosions. It's a huge thing. So any way a person not knowing that and not knowing about water uh… in New Mexico and the history of who's done what to whom and now asking people to reconcile hmm, not ready to do that yet. Not ready to do that yet, so history so important. 

00:24:35
[sil.] 

00:24:40
PUNCKY PAUL HEPPNER This umm… one of the things that uh… again Helen and I started to think about is "Okay, we've got a multicultural center." Similar to other or an Animal Cultural Center, Multicultural course and similar to other programs you know everybody's got one kind of thing, but we recognize that that was just the beginning. That really wasn't training our students the way we wanted. So we began to think about quote other learning opportunities. Umm… and so one of the things that we did was we developed a multicultural speaker series where we would uh… bring in people for uh… two days, big name people. Uh… I'll just give you a few of the names. Uh… Dr. Melba Vasquez, Joe White, Rosie Bingham, Derald Wing Sue, Will Lue, James Croteau, Patricia Arredondo. And so these individuals would come in, they would give two talks, two formal talks, but have many opportunities to rub shoulders. Uh… with uh… our invited guest, and it was a great opportunity for the students. They just loved it uh… and they love that Joe White, you know, knew their name. Uh… and if they'd see him at a conference or something, they connect and "Oh! so it was not only great for them to learn more about multicultural issues, but they felt like they were becoming part of the movement and that was great, that was tremendous. After a while umm… we uh… establish this center. Oh, and uh… we call the Speaker Series now the Helen Neville multicultural speaker after uh… in her honor. Umm… we also started the center for Multicultural Research, Training and Consultation. And initially, you know, we had like research teams that kind of thing umm… but also were doing any kind of interventions that might be going to classes at the University making presentations etcetera. Well, after several years umm… I got a call one day and it was a woman about 30, 40 miles away from Colombia, a small little community. Uh… and she says "I have 124th graders. Could you come out and do something multicultural? Something multicultural" And I said "Well, uh… tell me a little bit more about the something multicultural part kind of thing?" You know, and so I get more of an idea and I said Sure we can do that. And so we put five or six of our students who said "Here's the goal, here are some of the issues that are running into out there." Umm… and put together a presentation that you can handle 144th graders. So they did, and by all accounts it was, it was huge. Umm… and so and we would evaluate everything we do. And so some of the evaluations were just really sweet comments from little people, you know, saying "I, I learned how important it is to respect people" Uh… said "Oh, well, that's really good." So a number of things like them. Umm… maybe umm… after the center got going, just to give you some idea of the magnitude, we might touch maybe a 1000 people a year. So there was that 120th graders and then uh… 800 and some more uh… more. Helen, and then, this goes back to the Practicum group etcetera, and this is probably the largest that was. We did a number of other things. Umm… we're very aware that umm… the round table was a wonderful way, array of training opportunities, learning experiences. Yet, none of our students are very, very few would come here. So we thought and we asked them "What's, what's up" and basically they said uh… "Too expensive" uh… you know, it's we're in Missouri and New York is way over there, uh… okay, okay, so we then uh… we developed some stipends. They weren't large $200 or $300 and we would ask for applications and we picked a couple three students each year. Well what happened is umm… after three or four years of doing this, some of the students who had gotten a stipend in the first year, found "What a wonderful experience it was here at teachers' college." So they're finding themselves now totally. And 10 years later, we would not only have that going on, but now we'd have 10 students there. And it would be some of the students who have graduated, they have Ph.D's, they're coming back now and they're part of the group, and they're mentoring the group as well. "Oh, that's terrific." So we would do something like that. Umm… the second one, developing cross cultural learning programs uh… is huge. Umm… basically, I, I had realized from my own experience, and Marie talked about going to different countries and Fulbright's etcetera. How growth producing it can be to be immersed in another culture in which there's a lot of the pieces that you don't understand and what happens in that process? And now it's not really that far we moved or if you think about the U.S. in terms of different cultural groups and things going on there as well. So uh… we, I think, it was about 2005, we signed an agreement with National Taiwan Normal University that will have a dual degree masters program. They spend one year at uh… NTNU in the master's program then they come to Missouri for the second year, and they get two degrees. So we figure out a way of making those credits work. Uh… it was terrific. Umm… and then later, we started what we call the three pus two. Umm… hmm, hmm, it's not on there. Uh… but three plus two, three years of undergraduate, two years in our master's program, again two degrees. Umm… I think umm… we will have 30 or 40 graduates now from these two programs. And one of the things that we realized was when they came into our training program "Oh, this starts to introduce very different dynamics and they have different kind of understanding about what education is. Uh… and how you go about that process?" So we umm… they'll all get a faculty advisor. Uh… we started a cross-cultural psych class that would be their very first semester. And we would talk about the process of crossing cultural borders and uh… about provided a vehicle for them to share. Uh… they'd say "Oh, so and so is also feeling the same thing and but we also open it up to other students at M U." So that turned out to be very useful in, in that process. But we would have and then at the end of their training with us, they would always have to do as part of their comprehensive examination. What did you learn about coming here? And "Oh, it would be many, many very powerful things of crossing cultural borders and feeling so small and so weak and what they learned in that process." And, and how they learned to connect uh… with people from the U.S, very powerful. The cross-cultural immersion program was we would take maybe 15 students like this group to Taiwan for a two week immersion one year, the next year NTNU would send uh… 15 students to us. Then we would uh… provide lectures, cultural sites uh… social activities uh… that kind of thing. Oh, again really powerful times. Umm… so for instance, when we went over there, and then we had whole process time, so maybe two hours, sometimes three hours every other day, what's going on? What are you realizing? What's happening. Umm… and I think, was after about a week this one woman says " Oh! You know, I was just trying to buy some fruit at the market and they said the numbers, but I couldn't understand it. And after three times, I just put money in my hand and I held it out like this." And she said "I just felt so helpless, so weak." You know, and the other, others students are saying "No, don't do that." Umm… but she was getting in touch with being an outsider. And so we talk about things and how, how's the wonderful host that the Taiwanese students are? And they're always coming up and talking and taking us here and there, and that kind of thing. Umm… and, one of our students gets, excuse me, really quiet. Umm… and she says Jesus. Uh…this, this discussion is really painful for me because I realize that I sat beside an international student all semester long and never once that I initiate a conversation with her. I'm the insider." she says. But she couldn't recognize that at that time. So these kinds of observations, these kinds of experiences would happen. Uh… now an example of the ripple effect umm… Oh, and so kind Kenneth Wong and I, recently wrote up a qualitative study of some of the outcomes from the cross cultural immersion program. Umm… about a 100 students as of January will have gone on the cross-cultural immersion program. And umm… two passed students, two graduates of the cultural immersion program, now are, are at other institutions and they're developing these cultural immersion programs as well, one in Taiwan, one in the US. Uh… last thing in terms of creating structures. Uh… this is the international section within Division 17 Counseling Psychology and A.P.A. Uh… when I was president, it really and it became uh… into my awareness before that, that there was not a structure for international colleagues or international colleagues and I talked to some my colleagues, they say "Yeah, I go there and it's just so big, and it's a Sea, and I don't, nobody I know." etcetera, etcetera. You get the picture. And, and no one looks like me going to A.P.A. Uh… so basically, we created this section. Now it's well over a 100 people strong, almost 200, I think. I don't know the exact number over 200. Umm… so and uh… people feeling like there was more of a home for them around particular interests. 

00:36:00
[sil.] 

00:36:05
PUNCKY PAUL HEPPNER Another set of activities we did was self-efficacy. I think is a big thing. And so we did a number of things to promote uh… students' self efficacy as change agents. And the programs I'm going to talk about here, I'm, thinking, I have now touched about 9000 people. So it's been uh… very active. Umm… but uh… we set about developing some other learning opportunities. Uh… like teaching a graduate level multicultural seminar. So we set it up umm… and so people could pick African-American Psychology and, and they would teach it, have a faculty advisor etcetera. The undergraduate introductory diversity classes were uh… really powerful. Umm… so basically, we've kind of do like uh… introductory multicultural course for undergraduates and uh… very, very powerful, many things happening there. Umm… I don't have time for this story, but umm… just to tell you, I was able to invite the Chancellor two years ago uh… to attend when the students were doing a poster session, kind of like A.P.A, but the focus was on, here's what I learned in the course, this is what happened to me. And he was so moved by this. Uh… when he left he said umm… I don't know how we're going to do this, but we're going to offer this course to every undergraduate uh… just a matter of funding. So that was a umm… very powerful time. We developed International Career Student Career Services uh… a long story here. Umm… basically, we umm… we had people working at our career center, and we've very, very good career center. And they looked through their records and maybe they could find that there was five non uh… there were, there were five international students who came to the career center. It's like "Pretty, we've this Career center and we have 100 students coming through a day, how come? And then we, when we do the needs assessment, they would say "Nobody looks like me, I'm afraid they're not going to understand my language." Uh… etcetera. So anyway, we long story but basically uh… we were trying to model how's that you create change in the system? Who we have to talk to? What's the hierarchy? End of the story is we were funded for a $150 to create uh… uh… a new service within our existing career center. And uh… it was umm… uh… very powerful set of workshops, etcetera that came out of that. And, and the student were responsible for these kind of things. Another thing I'll just briefly and we're at the time there is many ethnocentric attitudes and insensitivities about second language learners uh… in our courses and in the US. Umm… and it seemed to me that this is a very important mentoring issue. And a long story here umm… one of the things that happened to me was uh… I decided I was going to learn Mandarin. And I went to the Mandarin Training Institute very famous in Taipei. And in the 3rd day, the instructor who was giving me a lot of space because I was, I was the oldest in there. And I had a higher high title all this stuff. Uh… she says "Haven't you done your home? And I'm like "Homework! What homework? There's no syllabus and nobody's signed homework." Okay, so it's a totally different pedagogical strategy. And that really was very enlightening for me in a lot of different ways. Umm… so it's not only a different vocabulary, uh… it's a different language structure uh… very, very different pedagogical strategies then I come back to Missouri and I'm thinking "Oh, Okay." And here my colleagues say "Oh, some of those international students, they're so quiet, they just sit in my class. I don't think, they're very interested in this stuff." I said "Okay, let's talk about this more." And so now as I was armed with some additional information, I could, I think I could do a much better job of talking about some of these things. Same thing with the TOEFL uh… the more I got into that, again that's language structure, I had listen to the students they'd say "Well, umm… they would have topic, stories, had answer, bunch of questions like umm… guerrilla warfare, that's guerrilla warfare." They didn't know anything about that. Uh… and so how you're going to answer questions, when they don't know what the content? So long story uh… many, many discussions with our faculty and in the end they said "Okay, let's forget the TOEFL and you just do your own language screening and we'll see how that goes?" You know, it went very well. Umm…

PUNCKY PAUL HEPPNER One of the things that I've been struck with which I think is very important about mentoring is that uh… Mentoring is not a one way street. Uh… it's a two way street. And mentors often learn and are changed in, in a very significant ways by our mentees. And so for instance, as I reflected on uh… you know, when I, I, I was initially a signed as Dr Helen Neville's mentor in the psych department, so we had senior faculty. Umm… and then I, when I was, you know, I kind of thinking "Well, what did I learned? How did I learn these things? You know and it was Helen Neville. She taught me so much and I was learning by doing. Uh… and her partner Sundiata Cha-Jua, Oh, you know, we just learned so much from them and Marie and I, were very fortunate. We went to South Africa with these two individuals, the year that apartheid ended which is "Oh, it was very, very powerful." Uh… and you know, I would say "Gosh!" I, uh… I had spent some time with administrators at one university and I could see how the system was set up to their disadvantage. Uh… and so raises were very uh… low for them because the things that they were wanting to do research on weren't the journals that would count in the system etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. And they would find this in the communities' etcetera, etcetera, And I remember one time, just being blown away by this and I'm talking to Helen and Sundiata and they're kind of quiet, and they just smile and they said "Well, same thing happens in the states." And sure enough as we would talk that through "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know." You know, Helen's going up for tenure "Well, that journal, I don't know about that journal, if we should count that one or not?" Uh… so uh… very, I just learned tremendous amount from those two. Umm… but other people as well, this was invited, this was a real high honor to be invited to Le Fay's home uh… during uh… the New Year celebration. Uh… these two are now in college or graduated from college which uh… really kind uh… makes me aware, more aware of the clock. Uh… Cha-Jua really was very, very good teacher on learning Mandarin etcetera. But then also some of our students were involved in this, and again learning from them and what's going on in their process. I think one also thing that's very important is, it's not only learn about multicultural things, but it's the joy of connecting with a broad range of people. And for me, that's just really the heart of it. It's a sort of like "Oh, that's really very, very deeply meaningful to me in this process. And when it's a two way street umm… when it's a mentoring situation going both ways uh… I think that's very, very important in terms of what happens over time in these relationships. We would have some students come back and say "Puncky, you know, we really love the program. Uh…" But I think uh… we were protected so much at M.U. that it was like we were in a bubble. Umm… and so like "Oh, we've got a, we've got to change some things. And so starting to talk more about how do you deal with uh… racism, racism and racists kinds of statements. Umm… but also in terms of the system, so you're in academia and what's going on there? Uh… okay, so talking about those things uh… I think is a very, very important topic. Sometimes, it's very complicated uh… because I feel like I can't really say what happened between me and that faculty member over there who said these insensitive comments about the cotton balls. Uh… but you know, what I mean. So you kind of have to change some things around etcetera in that process of talking about that and teaching about it.

PUNCKY PAUL HEPPNER When I look back on my 36 years umm… I'm not bragging, but I think over time, you know, we get a little smarter as we get older. Uh… and umm… that is a big deal, I think umm… that uh… we become smarter, we gain more wisdom over time. Uh… and I think we get that from our trials and tribulations, our joys and happiness when things work, our challenges and our sorrows and our pains. Umm… and so I still have pain over Helen Neville been in Missouri. So I think about that "What, what could I have done? What should I have done? How could we uh… avert this situation? Uh… it was a huge loss. I'm also from my own travel struck with umm… I mean in another cultural context, I don't know what's going on. Umm… I'm struggling with the Mandarin, I don't know the words or in French uh… same thing. I'm confused uh… when I'm in United Arab Emirates, I don't know what, what's happening here. And I'm struck with when I'm feeling anxious and uh… How nice it is for a helping hand? Even if it's a stranger, could I help you? Uh… we had this image of the, of the parishioners in our mind and when they're brusque litter… And we come in late with our big luggage uh… and we're going through the, the tubes in the systems and we have five people stop and say "Can we help you?" This is our introduction in Paris, It's just like "Wow that's, that's really, really sweet." Umm… so I think we learn and we become more sensitive over time from these kind of experiences, and we get better and we start putting more and more things together. Oh, I wanted to say also Learning from other cultures. Uh… this was at N.L.P.A, last year. Uh… and this woman was just absolutely fantastic in terms of talking about Latino folk medicine. Uh… and one of her things was human therapy, I never laughed so hard in my life and what a cleansing and deep cleansing that was. It's like "Oh, this is very interesting." This guy here uh… traditional Chinese medicine. He's smiling. I wasn't. Uh… very painful umm… but he was very, very good at what he does. Uh… and I learned a lot of "how can this work? Uh… real quick, I had a friend comes to visit in Taiwan. She says " I'd like to go there, uh… go there." He says at the end "Oh, something very serious in your abdomen. Uh… when you go back to the States, you should get this X. rayed, right away." She does and she has a blockage in her large intestine over of over an inch. So he, he picks this up by working on her foot. Uh… and I have many instances of this myself. So all of this then contributes to my wisdom of the world that I knew, maybe it doesn't really work that way. You know, this stuff about how I understand my body? There's other things' going on. So that again broadens my worldview uh… and my sensitivities, sometimes. Uh… so you know as I reflect on this in terms of my journey and this is my last slide. Umm… I also found that Mentoring is a lot of, there's a lot of challenges. And somehow we need to figure out ways of sustaining ourselves in this process. Uh… and not getting out of this job in five years, but how can I keep going, I added. And so sometimes, you know, my other life, I'm a potter, a wood fire potter. So sometimes doing that and uh… getting uh… that temperature up to over 2000 degrees, I know, there's something psychologically very cleansing about that. Uh… and sometimes with animals, umm… sometimes, it's music. These two dogs befriended us and became our guard dogs. Umm… sometimes, it's working with organic uh… gardening etcetera. And it's not just those activities but it's time to reflect and I'm struck with the number of things that come together when I do those things. And then it's this statement here, I think is very powerful. No one stands alone. Umm… and this is uh… prom uh… 36, 37 years ago that uh… Marie and I attended. Umm… so long standing relationships have been huge. Umm… and the one with Marie uh… is, is my soulmate. Uh… and that has been so, so important over the years. I just can't articulate all of those pieces. Umm… but they have that support, have that encouragement, that creativity uh… etcetera. So relationships, I think are very, very important. Umm… it's also Helen and Sundiata they had all these suspended men umm… Handy Williamson and Barbara Williams at M.U. very, very important. Uh… your way of course, colleagues. Uh… this is a wonderful colleague Joe. He has been just extraordinarily supportive of all the multicultural activities been involved with. He's now my martini uh… mentor which works good in retirement. Uh… and my advisor David Dickson, Dr David Dickson who brought me into this world. Umm… it's I think important that we figure out ways. Each of us are going to have very different ways of kind of keeping that tank at least half full. Uh… because it's very time consuming and very challenging work many times. And sometimes, I come home and say "What the hell I'm doing? Maybe, I should just be a potter? You know." Uh… so but thank you so much for coming. Uh… I greatly appreciate it. And uh… thanks again for the foresight of Teachers College uh… the leaders Marie, Neville and others. Thank you.
