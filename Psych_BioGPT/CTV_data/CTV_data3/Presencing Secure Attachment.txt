RICH SIMON Welcome everyone my name's Rich Simon, I'm Editor of Psychotherapy Networker and I'm your host for this webcast series on Attachment Theory in Action. Personally just even a few years ago the, the term, attachment theory, was not something that I personally was all that familiar with. I knew that, uh, there was a guy named John Bowlby and, uh, that it was something to do with human development but I didn't see it's relevance to psychotherapy and then those of you who read the Networker magazine know that we had an impromptu debate at the 2010 Networker symposium. Which Dan Siegel, one of the foremost exponents of the clinical implications of the attachment theory and Jerome Kagan, a very celebrated developmental researcher had a debate about the scientific validity of attachment theory and its relevance to psychotherapy. And in all the years that we have been publishing Networker magazine, I can't remember an issue that, uh, generated more discussion and more debate. And so, we had a web cast series called The Great Attachment Debate and this in some ways is a follow-up to that. Where we're really going to look at what are the clinical implications of attachment theory and what does that mean for the every day clinician and how you actually deal with a range of issues that people bring into your office. And who better to start off our series here than someone who really has been wrestling with those questions and integrating attachment theory into her work with, uh, trauma survivors. And, uh, her and developing, uh, uh, a way of integrating, a kind of a technology if you will, for really integrating these concepts and the, more the experience of, uh, secure human attachment into her work. And so, without further ado let's introduce today's guest, Diane Poole Heller. Diane, welcome. 

00:02:10

00:02:10
DIANE HELLER Hi, Rich. It's great to be here, thank you. 

00:02:15
RICH SIMON So, can you fill us in cause I'm, I'm a latecomer to this whole, uh, what seems to be one of the really most powerful trends in our field today about attachment theory and its application to clinical practice. When did you first get interested in attachment theory and, uh, how, how did you begin to integrate that into the work you've been doing? 

00:02:40
DIANE HELLER Well, I got really excited about looking at what happens in what I call healing in tribe. I started studying, uh, how to work with severe trauma situations in about 1989, and then started teaching in 1995, internationally. And I was really captivated by including the body and also, you know, how to regulate the nervous system, working with the brain. How to really help people come out of their amygdala stuck threat responses and complete defensive responses and, you know, work through traumatic symptoms. Which I, I learned mostly from Peter Levine, with somatic experiencing, really exciting work. 

00:03:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:03:15
DIANE HELLER And then of course one of the really major trauma symptoms is disconnection and isolation. When we're stuck in threat response physiologically it often short circuits a lot of our connection to social engagement, our ability to reconnect. Stephen Porges's work that we could talk about more later. And, um, really in trying to understand how do you bring people back out of isolation I found that working with relational field and how I was present as a therapist with a client in a very personal way became paramount to helping them come through to connect again but also in working in groups really how to help them rejoin the herd so to speak. 

00:03:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:03:55
DIANE HELLER So, relational focus, relational field, interpersonal, um, interactive regulation between therapist and client or partners and partners. Um, and then I teach in group a lot so I have the benefit of having a lot of really fine folks gathered to study this. Um, we could work a lot with, uh, with, um, healing in tribe. We even do, kind of, Greek chorus kinds of things, you know. 

00:04:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:04:15
DIANE HELLER Someone was having a hard time expressing something. I'd say well let's have the whole group do it at the same time, you know. So, we really use the group in a very, dynamic, interactive way. So, um, attachment and relational field for me have become, oh just such an incredible focus integrated with many other perspectives, but I see it as a key piece really. And this, at this moment in my career it's like the key piece. 

00:04:40
RICH SIMON So, so one of the things that I, I think has become more clear to me is that, um, underlying this interest in attachment theory is the, uh, a distinction that more and more people are becoming aware of between these two kinds of memory, implicit memory and explicit memory. And that the limitations of t-, of purely talk therapy when people are bringing into your office problems that are really located within implicit memory for which they don't have language. So, could you talk to us a little bit about how that plays itself, how you see that and how that plays itself out in the kind of work that you do? 

00:05:25
DIANE HELLER I really see that, that is one of the most important understandings we have to grow into clinically, uh, today. 

00:05:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:05:35
DIANE HELLER Because implicit memory, first of all attachment memory is stored in implicit memory because it's happening to you at such a young age, you know, in utero and, you know, through 12 to 18 months and, and on. It's, it's something, our attachment system is working 24/7, all the time but, those initial templates are getting formed very early and it's pre-mind. So, you can't be thinking about it. It's happening in a very, intrinsic, sensation, into your body throughout action sequences, literally that Beatrice, "Beattie" talks about between parent and child, she actually researches and films, much like Ed Tronick, also. 

00:06:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:06:10
DIANE HELLER Um, what's happening in that dynamic and then how these action sequences become patterned in, uh, how a person relates that then continues to influence their relational, uh, way of being basically the rest of their lives. So, the tricky part of that though is that it often remains non-conscious because it happens pre-verbally, non-cognitively, non-conceptually, sub-psychologically and, um, in this non-conscious way. So, when you're starting to work with relationship or even, uh, individuals that are coming out of a traumatic event that need to reconnect. You have to have a sense of how do you go in and excavate ex-, implicit memory so that it can become conscious. It's non-conscious to begin with but it can certainly become conscious. Work with it in such a way that it then becomes more explicit and can go through our normal ways: the brain and the nervous system and all of us, our spiritual self, our emotional self, our mental self integrates, uh, you know, wound or history to become freer and more authentically who we are. The tricky thing though that we can, I'd love to discuss here, is implicit often doesn't show up as a presenting issue because people... 

00:07:20
RICH SIMON That's right. 

00:07:20
DIANE HELLER ...don't know, very often what that is. Including the therapist sitting in the therapy chair doesn't exactly know very often what they're bringing in to the session implicitly from their attachment history. Uh, that's also interfacing and, and happening and reacting to whatever client situation they're currently in with a, with the person they're trying to help. 

00:07:40
RICH SIMON So, so another way to, to say that and, and I think it, it's, uh, I think your work really clarifies this along with a number of other folks. I think the reason that attachment theory has, uh, struck a nerve it's almost like we have a whole set of tools in this field that are the acknowledged mainstream conventional tools of talk and problem-solving and, uh, cognitive behavioral analysis and trying new behaviors and this and that. 

00:08:10
DIANE HELLER Right. 

00:08:10
RICH SIMON Our toolbox doesn't seem to relate to the, the issue of, uh, that is, in a sense, that has no name. That in, in a sense we're kind of, uh, coming into our lives in the dark. Not in the old sense of the Freudian unconscious, but in the sense that we have these relationship patterns and the sense of our, the, of attachment styles that cause us distress, disconnection, separate us from the tribe or the herd. And we don't even know it and we don't have language for it, and we're coming in about often something quite different. And we're coming into therapists who may not be versed in this to begin with. And with you as some, one of the people on the forefront of this there's a whole new generation and the idea of therapy becomes how do we help people have a secure attachment experience or relationship within psychotherapy. How does, does that fit what you're, you see yourself as trying to do with many of your clients? 

00:09:15
DIANE HELLER Absolutely I, what I'm so, I think this is actually very optimistic in a way because we have so much more knowledge. Which is, we live in exciting times, we have all this research in neuroscience, and attachment and relationship. There's a lot that we have available to us that we didn't have available even as much as five or 10 years ago. 

00:09:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:09:30
DIANE HELLER So, if we start to have an integrative focus on well okay all this research is fantastic, and then what the heck do we do with it sitting in front of somebody. Right? 

00:09:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:09:40
DIANE HELLER That's the way I structure all my workshops. It's like, okay, great, we know this and this and this and, you know, maybe, maybe we'll know more tomorrow, but. 

00:09:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:09:50
DIANE HELLER How do we change, make that practical in terms of the office or actually also practical in our important relationships all over the place. 

00:09:55
RICH SIMON And in the therapist's own self. 

00:10:00
DIANE HELLER Yeah, exactly. So, I'm trying to create safe spaces for therapists to, to excavate some of their own implicit memory in my trainings. Um, cause then they, if they've felt it themselves it's not much of a leap to understand how to help someone else if they've had that felt experience personally and then we're, we're kind of doing two things having them explore some of their own process. And then also looking at how do we, uh, work with that particular attachment adaptation, um, when someone is struggling with our office, in our office. And of course, just, I don't know if you would like me to give a little bit of a brief overview of some of the adaptations that can happen. Um. 

00:10:40
RICH SIMON Well, then. 

00:10:40
DIANE HELLER We can look at that. 

00:10:40
RICH SIMON Let's do this, Diane. So, so, it's, cause this has, um, uh. 

00:10:45
DIANE HELLER Gigantic. 

00:10:45
RICH SIMON Moved into a very heady and far ranging discussion of, uh, that has, is embodied in theory and research. For the purposes of this series, let's see if we can, we can come back to the concepts, but let's start off with a clinical situation. So you, so someone's coming in to your office. 

00:11:00
DIANE HELLER Okay. 

00:11:05
RICH SIMON It's session one and we've summarized a bit of your, some of your operating assumptions in your model. And you're trying to get at these, this implicit level of unease, perhaps of a difficulty in relationship that this individual has. Talk to me a little bit and describe for us, um, and, and maybe if you can just give us an example of somebody's who's come in for a first session with you. How do you go for the kind of material? How do you give the therapy the kind of focus that we've been very, briefly sketching up to this point? 

00:11:40
DIANE HELLER Well, certainly I, I'm attuning to what their presenting issue is, uh, why they're coming. Since I work so much in trauma and attachment it's usually one or both of those focuses, cause you can certainly have relational trauma. So, you can have both, easily. But, um, s-, I think one of the most im-, there's some important focuses. One is as much as we can all work through our own histories and have access to our own secure attachment. We're, I'm actively presencing secure attachment with a lot of intention and, uh, naturalness. But, you know, and that would include things like, um, certainly emphasizing safety, uh, my attentiveness with eye contact. You know, um, playfulness is a big part of secure attachment. Uh, interactive regulation, I'm sort of seeing how they're responding to the relational field I'm trying to co-create with them. 

00:12:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:12:30
DIANE HELLER Um, uh, the way I listen, the way I reflect, I, um, I reflect personally like how I'm perceiving or how I'm, to make sure I'm explicit in how I'm understanding them. So they feel that kind of felt, feeling felt or getting gotten kind of feeling. 

00:12:45
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:12:50
DIANE HELLER You know, uh, I think it's Dan Siegel that says we're born contingency detectors. 

00:12:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:12:50
DIANE HELLER And basically one of the pieces of contingency is you know when someone gets you. I mean. 

00:13:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:13:00
DIANE HELLER I can say I'm getting you, like oh I really understand, but you, something in you would say, yeah I don't really know. 

00:13:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:13:05
DIANE HELLER If she really gets me or oh man this person really gets me, wow. You know? And you're trying to move into that getting gotten zone. 

00:13:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:13:10
DIANE HELLER And, and sometimes that takes work. Like I kind of get this, but I,can you tell me more about this. Or you sort of said you're father was like this. But now, how did that work with mom? And you, you're trying to at least get to, you know, part of I think therapy, the clarity of attunement is being willing to hang in there and listen really carefully and observe visually what you're seeing in terms of some of these, um, instinctive reflexes that might be coming up. I think, I mean, an obvious thing was I had a client recently that would come in to the office and immediately take his glasses off. And I thought okay that could just be it's easier to see me or I don't know it could also be blurring me out. Right? 

00:13:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:13:50
DIANE HELLER So, after one or two sessions I just kind of mentioned that. I said I just noticed that you usually remove your glasses. How does that affect how you're seeing me? And because I'm working relational field. Right? 

00:14:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:14:00
DIANE HELLER And he says well I always take my glasses off when people are close to me because then I don't see them. Which is, uh, again a signal for probably avoidant attachment where other was never really felt as safe. So, one of the things then, just from something as simple as that, I would move into trying to create safety visually in eye contact. 

00:14:15
RICH SIMON OK, so if I'm coming in and I have, um, my, you know, I'm, I'm coming in and I'm, um, I just had a series of failed relationships and I'm kind of at sea in my life and I have the, the kind of, uh, the kind of issues that lots of, not, maybe not something that's so terribly specific but just my life isn't working out. Maybe I've been in therapy a couple of times before just, that hasn't worked out for me. How do you begin to identify what, what's going on with me or whatever client comes to mind here? How do you identify what are the attachment issues for this individual? And how do you try to begin to adapt to them? So, you're setting, you've just described setting a certain kind of atmosphere in the therapy of safety, of attentiveness, of attunement. I'm feeling at home, I'm feeling you're looking at me with kind eyes. 

00:15:15
DIANE HELLER Mm. 

00:15:15
RICH SIMON You're doing all the kinds of things that we know seem to put people at their ease. If you want to get a specific fit, fix on, in terms of my attachment issues in life. What do you do? How do you go about it? 

00:15:30
DIANE HELLER Well, one of the easier things to do of course is to do like a sort of a little attachment quiz. I even have a really abbreviated one on my website it's not meant to be diagnostic but just bring up awareness of oh, huh, I do kind of do that or I do feel more comfortable alone. I like my alone time and I sometimes I get kind of a little abrupt or, you know, irritable when people intrude on my time on the computer or my time watching TV or something. So, it poses questions where people start to take a look at where their comfort zones are and how they might you know most commonly react especially in their deeper relationships. Friendships are a little easier but when you start to get in a relationship with a partner. It doesn't even have to be a romantic relationship, but somebody that is a deep relationship for you and you, you, you're attachment system recognizes it's someone permanent. It'll pull on your attachment history. 

00:16:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:16:15
DIANE HELLER And then material comes up that you sort of might be blaming the other person for or feeling yourself. I don't know why I do this. And because it's really coming from those initial templates between action sequences that got laid down with mom and dad. 

00:16:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:16:30
DIANE HELLER Of when you were really young. And so often people think they know what's going on in their relationship but a lot of the times I don't know I'm even gonna. This isn't research based but I'm saying, thinking now, what I understand now, a significant amount of what's happening in our adult primary relationships or when we try to parent our own kids is c-, is directly coming from those original action sequences. And if that's true we have to get to them somehow. That's going back into your first question of how do we excavate that implicit memory, help that non-conscious become conscious and then move it through our normal channels. All the things we know how to do in therapy; talk therapy, you know, touch, energy work. Whatever it might be, to help it integrate the wound, begin to heal and you know move towards secure attachment, kind of back across the bridge. We adapted away from secure attachment because you can't avoid adapting if you're not in a secure attachment relationship. David Wallin says basically you're adapting in a way that you think will give you the most, the most, um, beneficial attachment relational field with a parent based on their deficits. 

00:17:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:17:40
DIANE HELLER So, if they're more comfortable not being engaged you'll disengage. In the weird paradox of that you're disengaging to try to keep the relationship working. Is that? 

00:17:50
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:17:50
DIANE HELLER It sounds crazy, but you have to adapt. 

00:17:55
RICH SIMON Paradoxical. 

00:17:55
DIANE HELLER And a baby is so able to read the relational field that they'll shift. And the other thing that I really wanna say is we're not, you know, like I would never say you're an avoidant person or you're an ambivalently attached person, or, you know. It's an adaptation to a specific relational field. So, in therapy I'm trying to change the relational field between me and my client back, as, as much as I can presence secure attachment. I call it presencing as a verb cause I think we want to think of it as a verb and not a noun. 

00:18:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Right. 

00:18:25
DIANE HELLER Presencing secure attachment, living it in the moment so that their attachment system gradually can start to shift and respond as it would in a secure attached relationship. That's not the only way I'd do it, that's one possibility. 

00:18:40
RICH SIMON Okay. So let's, let's see if we can, um, focus what you're doing and maybe, maybe choose either the kind of situation I'm describing or it, it was with a case that comes to mind. Just how, how does this happen? Let's operationalize it and give people a, an immediate sense of first session, someone's coming in. All this stuff is going on, all these, the thoughts that you, the assumptions that you've been, we've been discussing are in your head. What, what are we talking about? What, what are you doing? How are you, how are you trying to? What are picking up on and how are you trying to shape that experience of a first interview. 

00:19:25
DIANE HELLER Well, one of the things is I can take a quick look at their questionnaire. So, I get an idea of sort of where they're orienting. 

00:19:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:19:30
DIANE HELLER And what their experience has been and they can focus the, the um, the questionnaire towards a partner they're currently in a relationship with or their history with parents or one parent or the other parent. Um, and the information I'm getting from that then I might start to experiment with certain corrective experiences. Because the tricky part about implicit, most people aren't going to walk in saying I have a hard time. I mean, when someone's close to me I want to run out the door, you know. 

00:19:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:19:55
DIANE HELLER They don't often say it so clearly. 

00:20:00
RICH SIMON Mm. True. 

00:20:00
DIANE HELLER So, I think, like we talked about earlier I, I had a client I was suspecting was dealing with avoidance and probably some disorganized, because he had a pretty scary childhood and then was left alone way too much. And so, I just said I want you to imagine just right now here in the office if someone that you feel the closest to in your world, you know. And this happened to be a male friend of his and I said, you know, if you imagine that guy walking in the room right now, just as slowly and as far, you know, whatever distance you want just. 

00:20:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:20:25
DIANE HELLER You're in control of that. Just what happens when you imagine that and without him knowing it he was sitting in the chair he jerked back he just literally had this, this, um, reflexive jerking back that he was not aware of. 

00:20:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:20:35
DIANE HELLER I said, did you notice what just happened? When I invited this person that you feel the closest to and the safest with in the world, you just had this reflexive movement. 

00:20:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:20:45
DIANE HELLER So, that my point with that is you have to do something that triggers it. 

00:20:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:20:50
DIANE HELLER So, that you can see it and then it becomes conscious and then you can start to work with. What is it you're expecting when someone comes into your relational field. And then we could find out he was expecting, he had a very critical father but in a kind of very, yelling, toxic kind of way, a very overwhelming angry father. That, you know, had been in the war and had unresolved war trauma, you know, had his own reasons to have that. 

00:21:15
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:21:15
DIANE HELLER But the effect on his attachment system was to continue to disconnect and avoid even when he felt safe with someone. So, that's where our work then started to evolve. You know, how do we help him show up in a relational field when the relational field is safe enough and actually feel the presence of another person; physically, emotion ally in the energy field, whatever. 

00:21:35
RICH SIMON Yeah, let, let's. 

00:21:35
DIANE HELLER And be able to relax. 

00:21:35
RICH SIMON So, just, just we'll go on, um, with that for a moment so that, that I'm, I'm, uh, trying to zero in on your way of gathering information through both explicitly and through your own experience. So, um, you might, uh, part of it, you might ask about my early experience. 

00:22:00
DIANE HELLER Sure. 

00:22:00
RICH SIMON You might give, give me an experiential little exercise. Like imagine your friend is in the room. Is there, so tell me a little bit about it. So, how do you get from here's all the different possibilities, here's this person I barely know; to that point where you say oh I'm beginning to get a sense this is this person's issues. Some of which they're not, they may not be terribly able to put into language. 

00:22:25
DIANE HELLER Well, certainly we go over their intake and take a look at what they're concerns are. 

00:22:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:22:30
DIANE HELLER Obviously. 

00:22:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:22:30
DIANE HELLER Um, but once I get a little bit of a feel or I might sort of say I'm just wondering if you were left alone a lot as a kid or, you know, your parents tended to only talk to you in terms of tasks. Maybe they spent time with you but they were really into how to do things and maybe how to help you with your homework, but they didn't really know how to play. That's an indication of avoidant, too. You can move into like too much left brain. 

00:22:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:22:50
DIANE HELLER Um, focused. You're listening to narrative, narrative will also tell you which attachment style someone most likely is organized around. And remember this is morphable, we can morph it back to secure attachment, but it gets a little stuck sometimes, so. 

00:23:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:23:05
DIANE HELLER I don't like want to solidify that, but. 

00:23:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:23:10
DIANE HELLER Um, like in, in a narrative, uh, from an avoidant it tends to be, um, very factual, very positive. I, uh, well they gave me a roof over my head. They took me to the doctor when I broke my leg. 

00:23:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:23:25
DIANE HELLER I mean, what more do I want, right. 

00:23:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:23:25
DIANE HELLER That's nice and, of course, those things are important but that's not really secure attachment. Secure attachment is being cuddled, having someone that can contain your emotional self and relate to your limbic brain. The limbic brain that h-, that, um, is playful, has that gleam, beam you know where your special to me kind of look. I call it the gleam beam. 

00:23:45
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:23:45
DIANE HELLER Which you can shoot people very easily. It doesn't cost any money and it really nourishes the secure attachment, uh, field. But folks that've been left alone too long or been criticized a lot or, um, you know, their nervous system basically has never even learned how to interactively regulate with their parents' nervous system. So, they don't really see in a body way an advantage to other. 

00:24:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:24:05
DIANE HELLER They have much more of an orientation to self. 

00:24:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:24:10
DIANE HELLER I think our culture is a little bit like this actually. We're, we're very hyper, you know, independent, we have independence day, I think that we should also have dependence day. 

00:24:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

00:24:15
DIANE HELLER And eventually interdependence day. You know? 

00:24:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:24:20
DIANE HELLER But we're, you know, we have a reflexive autonomy in this country. 

00:24:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:24:25
DIANE HELLER Because so often, not anybody's fault exactly but we're so oriented to do it yourself or, you know, pull yourself up by your bootstraps or you know we can do that. That's a capacity but then interactively regulating is one of the main ways people find an ability to relax, to sleep, to eat in a regulated way where there's not trouble with weight. I mean, you know, there's all these things that help you feel better in your own self but also relationally. We're social beings, we're social brains like Lou Cozolino likes to say. 

00:25:00
RICH SIMON So, I'm getting from what. What you're saying then is so part of it is people are, you're like many therapists, you're asking people what's the story of growing up? What's your relationship with your parents? What were these early experiences like? You're listening as much to how the story is told than to the details of the story maybe more, more of the how than the why. 

00:25:20
DIANE HELLER More the how, actually. 

00:25:20
RICH SIMON And then, and, and sort of into the intuitive thing, the thing that isn't so word bound. What else are you, is important for you in forming those early impressions of the client? And getting a sense of here's what the work is, here's what this, where the person is at and this is what this person needs? Whether they're asking for it cause the, uh, the complication here is when we move into this realm of implicit memory and early attachment experience people are not as, it's not like a legal contractual relationship. 

00:25:55
DIANE HELLER Right. 

00:25:55
RICH SIMON Where people are I really want to help you to help me get over this habit within three weeks and let's get a contract about that. It doesn't seem as if this kind of work, uh, can follow in, within that kind of structure. We're talking about a different animal here. 

00:26:10
DIANE HELLER Well as I get a little bit more, uh, feeling for which attachment adaptation they had to make as children that they might be importing into their adult relationships. Um, then I start to use very specific, what I call, corrective experiences that are designed to nourish the secure attachment system. 

00:26:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:26:30
DIANE HELLER Because I believe we all have that, I feel fundamentally we have the biology, psychology, soul that creates a secure attachment system and then things get in the way. So, my feeling about that is we can basically excavate that secure attachment system. And eventually we want it to dominate over any attachment adaptation, you know, at least most of it. Right? 

00:26:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:26:50
DIANE HELLER Not that anything is ever 100% but, um, so I'm doing a couple of things when I'm working with them. Anytime I see a signal from the secure attachment system, I'm amplifying it. So, I'm making sure they're aware of their secure attachment system when it starts to function. Like when this gentleman felt comfortable enough to put his eyeglasses on and actually be in contact with me. 

00:27:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:27:10
RICH SIMON I mean I could see him see my eyes back to his eyes. I had to talk about that because he could have just felt good. But he didn't understand that he was actually letting me in that he was seeing me as an other that was friendly and he was actually okay. 

00:27:25
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:27:25
DIANE HELLER In the attachment gaze a bit more. He would have left. I think Diana Fosha said something like this in your last interview. Like yeah, like he would have had an, oh yeah that's a nice therapist but he wouldn't have had the experience of, I actually was in a field with another person that's relating to me and understanding me and I, I get the experience other. Because that's the correction for avoidant back to secure attachment. 

00:27:45
RICH SIMON So, stay with that first. 

00:27:45
DIANE HELLER So, I have very. Yeah. 

00:27:50
RICH SIMON So, how did you? What do you say? Tell, take us inside the moment in a kinda more moment by moment thing of how do you create a moment like that. That isn't just the thought oh this is nice, I can see my therapist. 

00:28:00
DIANE HELLER Yeah. 

00:28:00
RICH SIMON What is it that you're saying to him or to me? However you can convey this to us? 

00:28:05
DIANE HELLER Well, I might say something like, I know that from what you told me already that early on looking out into the world just eyeball to eyeball. Right? You, what you saw when someone was looking back at you when you were little from what you told me is either very strong criticism and kind of this anger, overwhelming anger coming towards you or this sort of nothing because of being left alone so much. 

00:28:30
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:28:30
DIANE HELLER So, I'm wondering what it's like right now sitting with, like I'm looking at you right. 

00:28:35
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:28:35
DIANE HELLER What's it's like right now just for you to look into my eyes or look into my face. 

00:28:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:28:40
DIANE HELLER Seeing me looking back at you. 

00:28:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:28:45
DIANE HELLER And I'm not feeling angry. 

00:28:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:28:45
DIANE HELLER And hopefully I'm somewhat present. I mean, I'm as present as I can be. 

00:28:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:28:50
DIANE HELLER What happens in your experience when you see me this way? So, I can take you to the moment like that. Or I could use your best friend, your dog, your someone you love, your grandmother, you know, in, in memory. You know, what was it like to look into her eyes? 

00:29:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:29:05
DIANE HELLER Can you remember seeing her look at you? 

00:29:05
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:29:05
DIANE HELLER As I, you're special to me, I love you. 

00:29:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:29:10
DIANE HELLER You're my grandson. 

00:29:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:29:10
DIANE HELLER You're really great and wherever I can get it. So, sometimes I'm doing more intrapsychic, more like IFS, you know, with, with, uh, our friend. 

00:29:20
RICH SIMON David Schwartz. 

00:29:20
DIANE HELLER David Schwartz. 

00:29:20
RICH SIMON David Schwartz. 

00:29:20
DIANE HELLER Or sometimes I'm doing it extrapsychically, uh, you know, with, with, uh, somebody they're imagining. Like bringing their grandmother in from the outside. Sometimes it's their adult self to their younger self that's what I meant by intrapsychic. 

00:29:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:29:30
DIANE HELLER Sometimes it's in the moment more like Diana was talking about. Like reflecting right now, amplifying the positive moments between us in the now. And I, I use it, whatever I can get. In addition, I do specific corrective experiences for each atta-, attachment adaptation. 

00:29:50
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:29:50
DIANE HELLER And I'm trying to be fluent in the languaging and the experience I think someone's happening, having whichever adaptation they're in and then I switch languages. So, like if there's, they're in an avoidant moment because you can have a mix of attachment adaptations. 

00:30:05
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:30:05
DIANE HELLER Depending on parents, stepparents, grandparents. Um, so if they're in more of an avoidance phase, then I have certain corrective experiences I'm happy to share for that. 

00:30:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:30:10
DIANE HELLER And then if they switch to something like disorganized where threat is the most dominant thing then I switch my language to that. So, I mean they're speaking French, German, you know, English, Romanian, whatever it is. 

00:30:25
RICH SIMON (inaudible ) multilingual. 

00:30:26
DIANE HELLER Depending on where they go and that's what I'm trying to teach therapists is how to be multilingual with attachment. 

00:30:30
RICH SIMON The language of different attachment styles. 

00:30:30
DIANE HELLER Yeah. 

00:30:30
RICH SIMON So let's, let's stay with this cause this, this seems very interesting and I think relevant to lots of folks who are listening to us. So, just to go back for a moment, so the first part is you are quite early in therapy you're trying to evoke in whatever way you can some experience almost like a reference experience of secure attachment. 

00:30:50
DIANE HELLER Yes. 

00:30:50
RICH SIMON You're trying to find. 

00:30:50
DIANE HELLER An oasis. 

00:30:50
RICH SIMON An oasis, wherever that is even with somebody who's experienced some horrible. 

00:30:55
DIANE HELLER Yeah. 

00:31:00
RICH SIMON Some horrible upbringing or going through some traumatic episode, and (inaudible ). 

00:31:03
DIANE HELLER We want to get it in the picture. 

00:31:03
RICH SIMON (inaudible ) 

00:31:05
DIANE HELLER You, know? So, we can go what difference does it make. What happens when you switch to this. 

00:31:05
RICH SIMON You're wanting them to feel it. 

00:31:10
DIANE HELLER Yes, in felt sense to have it in their body really(ph). 

00:31:10
RICH SIMON So, you're trying to enhance that felt sense, you're kind of. 

00:31:15
DIANE HELLER Yes. 

00:31:15
RICH SIMON You might be putting them; giving them some exercise, the friend; imagining somebody and then really heightening the awareness of the impact of that individual. 

00:31:25
DIANE HELLER Right. 

00:31:25
RICH SIMON Real or even imagined on how they are in that moment. 

00:31:30
DIANE HELLER And even when you do a corrective experience they may s-, sound somewhat benign but they're designed to pull on the deepest part of the attachment system. So, for instance if I say, um, to someone. I want you just to eyes open, eyes closed, however it works for you. Just to imagine someone looking at you with kind eyes. You know? 

00:31:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:31:50
DIANE HELLER Whoever that might be and it can include animals right cause they're still in limbic. What. 

00:31:55
RICH SIMON Right, you know, animals are great, they have very kind eyes. 

00:31:55
DIANE HELLER Animals are great, I mean, dogs often have those wonderful, unconditional loving eyes. 

00:32:00
RICH SIMON Mm. Yeah. 

00:32:00
DIANE HELLER And, um, just what happens when you just, you know, relax and just let yourself as much as you can receive or take in the experience of those kind eyes. 

00:32:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:32:10
DIANE HELLER Like you're letting your eyes look out and look at them and maybe you can also feel your eyes taking them in. 

00:32:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:32:20
DIANE HELLER It could be a favorite person, it could be your marriage partner, it could be a child, it could be an animal. Whoever that might be, someone you saw on the movies, anywhere. 

00:32:25
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:32:25
DIANE HELLER Um, and then or the other example that kind of helps us is if you think about you stop by a friend's house unexpectedly and they open the door and they just naturally have this, oh my gosh, it's you. I'm so glad to see you. 

00:32:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:32:40
DIANE HELLER And it feels really authentic and they have this kind of light up, you know, because they see you. If you can take in that's what I'm calling a gleam beam, you know. 

00:32:45
RICH SIMON Gleam beam. 

00:32:45
DIANE HELLER Your special to me and it's a really personal. 

00:32:50
RICH SIMON Great, great phrase, I like that. OK. 

00:32:50
DIANE HELLER It's not just they have nice eyes. 

00:32:50
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:32:50
DIANE HELLER It's personal. 

00:32:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:32:50
DIANE HELLER And then so what happens if you bring that in a little bit and you can track that in your own body. 

00:32:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Sure. 

00:32:55
DIANE HELLER Rich, if you like. What do you notice? 

00:33:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:33:00
DIANE HELLER If someone is looking at you that way. 

00:33:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:33:05
DIANE HELLER And just noticing what happens. This is called the amplifying a positive moment. 

00:33:05
RICH SIMON Sure.(ph) 

00:33:05
DIANE HELLER What happens in you as you kind of soak it up, like a sponge. 

00:33:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:33:10
DIANE HELLER And this is feeding literally, I can think of this as contact nutrition. This is literally food. 

00:33:15
RICH SIMON I, I know that. 

00:33:15
DIANE HELLER You know, nourishment. 

00:33:20
RICH SIMON I feel that way. Yeah. 

00:33:20
DIANE HELLER Yeah. It does doesn't it 

00:33:20
RICH SIMON It's emotionally very nourishing and I can feel it as it begins as a warmth in my chest. 

00:33:25
DIANE HELLER Yeah, so keep going with it. It'll, it'll keep going until it doesn't right. But I mean, it's, it, we're trying to expand that awareness. 

00:33:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:33:35
DIANE HELLER And then this becomes a marker for secure attachment. 

00:33:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:33:35
DIANE HELLER And I just say, hey, this is your secure attachment system working. You have a secure attachment system. 

00:33:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:33:40
DIANE HELLER You can recognize when something really healthy and beautiful happens in a relational field and your chest responds, you get warmer. What else do you notice? 

00:33:50
RICH SIMON Breathing changes. 

00:33:50
DIANE HELLER Your breathing gets a little more expanded. I'm listening. 

00:33:55
RICH SIMON My face, my face relaxes. 

00:33:55
DIANE HELLER Your face relaxes. 

00:33:55
RICH SIMON And then you, there is a difference in, in the way I look, the eyes. 

00:34:00
DIANE HELLER What happens in your eyes because this is an eyeball to eyeball exercise. Right? 

00:34:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:34:05
DIANE HELLER So, we're working specifically with the attachment gaze. Right? 

00:34:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. This is a softening of the eyes. 

00:34:10
DIANE HELLER This is a healthy attachment gaze. 

00:34:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:34:10
DIANE HELLER And what, and the eyes will soften? Right? 

00:34:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:34:15
DIANE HELLER So, yeah and this is literally if you were coming from a difficulty this would be a bridge back to secure attachment. 

00:34:20
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:34:20
DIANE HELLER And it's, it's a very experiential bridge. Right? 

00:34:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:34:25
DIANE HELLER It literally shifts your state and I could imagine your amygdala is calming down, you're not in threat mode. 

00:34:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:34:30
DIANE HELLER It doesn't appear right now. Well, I'm really paying attention to is there a relaxation in the relational field. There's relaxation in you, but is there also. How is it between you and I right now? When we're talking about kind eyes. 

00:34:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:34:45
DIANE HELLER Or when you begin to interact with me again. 

00:34:45
RICH SIMON All right, so I got it, she's not actually going to storm off in the middle of this interview. I'm beginning to relax. She's not gonna unleash her inner Rush Limbaugh on me. 

00:34:55
DIANE HELLER Oh, my God. 

00:34:55
RICH SIMON What a comforting experience to take that in, into my person. 

00:35:00
DIANE HELLER And see what you just said gave me my next clinical clue. 

00:35:05
RICH SIMON OK. 

00:35:05
DIANE HELLER Because then I would say and I'm here. I'm not going anywhere. 

00:35:10
RICH SIMON Yes. 

00:35:10
DIANE HELLER That's the consistency element of secure attachment because not everybody would have that specific reaction. She's not gonna run away. Right. 

00:35:15
RICH SIMON Yeah, right. 

00:35:15
DIANE HELLER That could be coming I don't know I'm not trying, you know, to do an exposure thing here. 

00:35:20
RICH SIMON Right, right. 

00:35:20
DIANE HELLER But that could be coming from a concern that went back to what happened early on about not really knowing if somebody is going to be consistent enough. 

00:35:30
RICH SIMON There or not, yeah. 

00:35:30
DIANE HELLER So, what I might take from what you just said, I'd say yes and how is it to notice that I'm here. 

00:35:35
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:35:35
DIANE HELLER I'm not going anywhere. 

00:35:35
RICH SIMON Mm. Yeah. 

00:35:40
DIANE HELLER Right. 

00:35:40
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. 

00:35:40
DIANE HELLER And then that would be the next thing. What happens in your body when you notice we're in this together, right now? 

00:35:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:35:45
DIANE HELLER Your not on your own we can do this together. Whatever feelings come up we can hold together. 

00:35:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:35:50
DIANE HELLER Because. 

00:35:50
RICH SIMON There is a relationship. 

00:35:55
DIANE HELLER We're trying to really. 

00:35:55
RICH SIMON There's a whole relational field that's being created here, it's not just me. 

00:36:00
DIANE HELLER Yes. 

00:36:00
RICH SIMON And you but there's this relational field, there is this us thing. 

00:36:05
DIANE HELLER Yeah. 

00:36:05
RICH SIMON Whatever that is that's beginning to, to happen here, to be created. 

00:36:10
DIANE HELLER And that specifically has certain qualities and so every opportunity I get, I'm amplifying the secure attachment elements of it. 

00:36:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:36:15
DIANE HELLER Now when I say, like, like, let's imagine kind eyes you might initially think, oh that's a nice exercise everybody's gonna enjoy that. 

00:36:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:36:25
DIANE HELLER That's not true because if you had a lot of negative, like hateful, or angry, or abusive or nobody's home like kind of that still face of the Ed Tronick's research. 

00:36:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:36:35
DIANE HELLER Then actually I might ask for kind eyes, and a person might say I can't find them. 

00:36:40
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:36:40
DIANE HELLER They might say I just get scared. When you ask me for that I get scared because for them attachment gaze was frightening. So, that gives me then my next clinical clue. 

00:36:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:36:50
DIANE HELLER OK, we have to work with threat and we have to work with safety. 

00:36:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:36:55
DIANE HELLER And I might switch my focus then to let's imagine a competent protector. Who have you ever seen in a movie or read about in a book? 

00:37:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:37:05
DIANE HELLER Or maybe had a dog that barked at strangers or anytime you felt any sense of someone in the world is protective. And then I might go what happens in your body when you bring that in? 

00:37:15
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:37:15
DIANE HELLER If they can't find that I have another whole way to get to it. I mean, I just keep going and going and going. 

00:37:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:37:20
DIANE HELLER Until they get a felt sense of what I'm calling again this corrective experience that will give them the substructure to go back to secure attachment. Because when you think about attachment, we're in the basement. We're in the very earliest imprints on the body and soul, our psychological self. The very beginning template of what everything builds on after. So, we're, we're working around with changing the foundation. And the cool thing is you start changing the foundation and somebody starts to feel more securely attached. It starts to very quickly, uh, affect the rest of the structure. So, in a way it's a very efficient way of working especially if you're working on relationship, uh, relational topics. 

00:38:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:38:00
DIANE HELLER It gets into, it gets into the root of it right away. 

00:38:05
RICH SIMON So, let's, let's, so what we've been talking about here and you've been illustrating so nicely is the various ways in which you are helping me to have this experience early on. It sounds like this is something you'd like to have happen if at all possible in the very first session. 

00:38:20
DIANE HELLER Yeah. 

00:38:20
RICH SIMON (inaudible ) 

00:38:24
DIANE HELLER I start right away. 

00:38:25
RICH SIMON Right, right away, so we know oh, this, uh, might have, whether, how I, however I can label it. Oh, I can have this, this more secure attachment experience with this person; maybe there is an us not just a me and a her. 

00:38:35
DIANE HELLER Right. 

00:38:35
RICH SIMON So, but the other thing you were talking about a moment ago and we can come back to this and that the other piece of this is speaking the language of these various attachment styles. 

00:38:45
DIANE HELLER Yes. 

00:38:45
RICH SIMON So, this is the, so now you're talking about the ability to create a bridge with folks in the very first session. The flip side of that is to recognize the obstacles to creating those bridges and learning about lang-, the language that you use in order to create the bridge with people with different attachment styles. So, so in a very concrete way can you talk to us about how you might talk. You know, name a different, uh, let's go through the different attachment styles. 

00:39:15
DIANE HELLER Sure.(ph) 

00:39:15
RICH SIMON And just give us a bit of the flavor of how you begin to engage them and begin to talk their language. 

00:39:25
DIANE HELLER Okay, um, so again because we're t-, we're working with implicit so much I'm gonna throw pebbles in the pond and see what happens. Right? So, and I have the questionnaire usually that I've already seen what they've answered so I get to kind of have an idea where they're orienting mostly. 

00:39:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:39:40
DIANE HELLER And so, that's a clue to begin with. But for instance, if I, here's the difference in language I'm gonna g-, go from French and Spanish here for a minute. 

00:39:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:39:45
DIANE HELLER Okay, so let's say I'm speaking French, let's say I'm speaking avoidant, um, the, one of the ways the avoidant survive their history at least some of the time was that because other was either felt as negative, like hurtful. Or other was experienced as not there at all and they were left there alone way too much. Or there's a third way it can happen which is interesting for our culture in particular is if you're only talked to in terms of task. Like a parent might be really present but only when th-, your doing something like homework or teaching you how to do your laundry or teaching you something. There's nothing wrong with that except that if it's only that you're gonna still get the overemphasis of the left brain and not enough access to emotional and intuitive and, you know, sensitivity that way. So, if I know that then one of the things that happens is an avoid builds kind of a bubble of aloneness. They have like a, they're living in an isolation orientation. And so they tend to dismiss the presence of other because other wasn't experienced as nourishing. So, a very self, um, reliant, very self-regulating but they tend to self-regulate in a dissociative way like zoning out on a computer or zoning out on music or you know, going in to, in nature all by themselves. And there's nothing wrong with those activities. It's just when they're used to regulate yourself in place of relationship too much of the time you're missing out on a whole big bunch of wonderful things that can happen in life. 

00:41:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:41:15
DIANE HELLER Relationship, right. So, they often don't see the problem though. 

00:41:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:41:20
DIANE HELLER So, so, you know, I'm fine what's the problem or I'm good, you know, I'm on my own. I'm living the American dream of self-sufficiency, you know. So, you have to kind of get them on board and, and in terms of even noticing that this might be problematic. And, and they tend to fill their own needs they can be a little bit, like, dismissive of people who have needs that want something from them. Because they're, hey, I do it myself, why don't you do it yourself, you know. 

00:41:40
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:41:40
DIANE HELLER So, um, so speaking the language of avoidant that in terms of how are they gonna cross the bridge back to secure. You have to have them start to experience, um, their, what, how they deflect the presence of another person. You know, like, like the gentleman who I said who does the moving back or puts the glasses off so as not to see you. 

00:42:00
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:42:05
DIANE HELLER Or, um, tends to want to, can only be nourished alone. Or tends to go into a trancy kind of place where they're not present. And, uh, so in speaking the correction for avoidant you're doing a lot of things like the kind eyes or one of the things I do is; this is a beautiful exercise actually. Is, um, welcome to the world, designing your own welcome to the world. Like if you could create any situation of coming in as a baby and having the right, the right situation what would that be. And when p-, people spend a lot of time getting into that and it could just be being born into warm hands. It could be being surrounded by all the people who are gonna love you in the future and they are introducing them to you. 

00:42:45
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:42:45
DIANE HELLER Like, uh, oh, I don't get to meet you, I'm your first grade teacher and I don't get to meet you till you're five but you know I teach you how to do, you know, baseball or whatever. 

00:42:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:42:50
DIANE HELLER Or I'm your first friend or I'm your first love at 13, you know, or your first infatuation. 

00:43:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:43:00
DIANE HELLER And, and like sort of introducing them to all these people kind of gives you the baby, those initial structures a sense of something good is going to happen eventually. Right? And this, this interest in wanting to connect. And see as soon as that, that thread of I want to connect. I want. That's the normal attachment system. People will, will often feel weak or they'll often feel bad about those feelings because they weren't met originally. And then you, you highlight that. Go wow, this is really great I know this is painful right now that no one was there originally. But you're feeling that you want to connect is actually the healing. And right now I bet there's people in your life even your adult self. Like if we go to the adult 50-year-old that how is for him to want to connect with you, you know. You're just getting these threads of connection. So, that would be like language for avoidant in a very, quick overview. If we switch to ambivalent it's opposite. 

00:43:45
RICH SIMON So, let me just, let's stay with that for a second, Diane. 

00:43:50
DIANE HELLER Oh, okay. 

00:43:50
RICH SIMON That, that, so the, the issue here and in this kind of work is, where is the motivation for change coming? 

00:44:00
DIANE HELLER Right. 

00:44:00
RICH SIMON So, if, uh, it's, it's not as if I've defined a problem. I've negotiated my behavioral contract with my therapist. I have my homework. 

00:44:05
DIANE HELLER You might be doing that, too. 

00:44:10
RICH SIMON But, uh, that's not what we're talking about at the moment, that aspect of it. So, you're, you're trying to seems a lot of what we've been describing so far at least is you're creating an alternative experiential world for me as your, as your client. And you're giving me new reference experiences that aren't in here. 

00:44:30
DIANE HELLER Yes. 

00:44:30
RICH SIMON And you're, you're activating aspects of self because you don't believe in absolutes and you don't believe that anybody is permanently imprisoned in some restricted attachment style. But with the, the person somewhat in charge of speaking the language. How did one, how do you speak the language of the avoidantly attached person who's not at all sure that they want these alternative experiences? And how do you invite them in to having the relationship with you, as, as lovely and wonderful and as, um, uh, accepting and attuned as you are. How do you then help them feel like they wanna go across this bridge? 

00:45:10
DIANE HELLER Well, often I'm naming it. I'm naming what I'm seeing and I'm ... 

00:45:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:45:15
DIANE HELLER And I'm exploring with them in a very, with kind attention of course. 

00:45:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:45:20
DIANE HELLER And, and normalizing their experience, part of it is education. Just say like I, it's like gosh you know I've never been in a deep relationship or I see all these families and I feel envy. And, and I miss, I see my next door neighbor's, I don't even know them but they moved out and I miss them. And why am I missing them I don't even know them, you know? 

00:45:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:45:35
DIANE HELLER And I'm going well maybe that missing is coming from part of you that really would like to be more connected or what do you think that missing is telling you? You know, I mean it seems like you're lov-, what is it you love about that family that you've never met? Well, I see them connected and I see the parents playing with the kids. And I feel like why do they have that and I don't have that? 

00:45:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:45:55
DIANE HELLER And, you know, you're, you're, you're kind of directing you're questioning in a, in a certain inquiry, uh, of what is your relational field like? 

00:46:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:46:00
DIANE HELLER And then often as people start to really contemplate it they begin to have the feelings of wanting to connect. Because their secure attachment system starts to get triggered. When I do a kind eyes exercise or welcome to the world, part of that is that's a lovely exercise for secure attachment it can be very, painful for an adaptation. But if they even get into the pain it's on the way back. 

00:46:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:46:25
DIANE HELLER Than just feeling like it's all OK, I don't need people, I don't want people. I'm better off by myself, people don't work, I fill my needs better than other people fill my needs. So, what do I need them for? Those, that's the language of avoidant attachment. I'm coming in with countering it. 

00:46:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:46:40
DIANE HELLER I'm understanding and empathizing with it; but countering it with secure attachment and looking like, like, kind of like, uh, I don't know I've got my radar out for relational field and how I might invite them in or let them be curious. Isn't it curious that, you, you coming to me wanting some work with attachment and wanting some work with rela-, the curiosity of not having been in relationship. But you come in the office and you take your glasses off to make sure you don't see me. 

00:47:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:47:05
DIANE HELLER And I said so that's interesting. 

00:47:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:47:10
DIANE HELLER And then I do a little of what I call Columbo(ph) therapy. 

00:47:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:47:10
DIANE HELLER I do a lot of Columbo therapy, like, huh I wonder what that's about, you know? And I wonder what would happen if you just put your glasses on for a microsecond and take 'em off again. You know, cause I don't want to control, I'm not trying to push people. 

00:47:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:47:25
DIANE HELLER I'm trying to open doors. 

00:47:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:47:25
DIANE HELLER With invitation but never pushing someone through the door. Right? 

00:47:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm, yeah. 

00:47:30
DIANE HELLER So they can, and then I just am watching maybe the first time I open the door they just look at the door. 

00:47:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:47:35
DIANE HELLER But the second, third, fourth, fifth I'm kind of tenacious. Eventually they're curious about what's on the other side of the door. 

00:47:40
RICH SIMON So, that's a, that's a, I think that's a great word to describe so it does feel as, um, it, we're, we're doing this and I'm, I'm partly your, your patient and partly imagining someone being your patient that it is a therapy of invitation. Isn't it? 

00:48:00
DIANE HELLER Yes. 

00:48:00
RICH SIMON It's sort of you're taking me, not taking so t-, so literally. We're not literally struggling with the details of my problem. Uh, which, which might be the main agenda in many psychotherapies. But it is, it is a therapy of invitation, you're inviting me to imagine, to contact memory, implicit memory give words to things. 

00:48:20
DIANE HELLER Yes. 

00:48:25
RICH SIMON And then see what happens. 

00:48:25
DIANE HELLER And, and by taking the experience from then as people have remembered their history and bringing it in to describing what's happening now. Cause healing is actually happening in the now even when you're referencing the past. Oops. Um, I, it went black for a minute and I lost you. 

00:48:40
RICH SIMON I'm here now. 

00:48:40
DIANE HELLER Um, so. 

00:48:40
RICH SIMON I'm not gonna (inaudible )(crosstalk). 

00:48:44
DIANE HELLER (inaudible)(crosstalk) You left, you left our attachment system's activated. Ah. (inaudible)(crosstalk) 

00:48:45
RICH SIMON (inaudible )(crosstalk) It works both ways, it works both ways. 

00:48:46
DIANE HELLER Oh my God. Oh my God. Yeah, so, so, um, you're, you're like. When I think about what I like about this. What I find is that (inaudible )(crosstalk) 

00:49:00
RICH SIMON (inaudible)(crosstalk) 

00:49:00
DIANE HELLER (inaudible) sort of like rock climbing therapy. 

00:49:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:49:00
DIANE HELLER What I mean by that is you have to be present. You can't be thinking about what you're gonna make for dinner because you're watching the facial expression. 

00:49:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:49:10
DIANE HELLER You're watching whether they fade in or out in their eyes. You're watching if they move back. You're watching if they, they lose themselves and they come over into you and they aren't really there. 

00:49:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:49:20
DIANE HELLER They're trying to, uh, be compliant. 

00:49:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:49:20
DIANE HELLER Or they're more about you than they are about them. 

00:49:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:49:25
DIANE HELLER You're, you're watching all these things a little bit, not like a hyper alertness exactly but it is a very presence. 

00:49:30
RICH SIMON That's why you tend to, uh. 

00:49:30
DIANE HELLER That's why I use presencing. 

00:49:30
RICH SIMON Working, you're, you're picking up on the broadcast. 

00:49:35
DIANE HELLER Yeah. As much as you. 

00:49:35
RICH SIMON Yeah, not only on the, the, the words and. 

00:49:40
DIANE HELLER Yeah. 

00:49:40
RICH SIMON You're picking up on the music. 

00:49:40
DIANE HELLER And maybe, and maybe the content. You know, usually we think of in therapy as content being so primary. I think of content a little bit more in the background like the content frames things and gives you kind of a little layout. But you don't want to get lost in the story to the point that you're missing these little tiny interactive signals that are always going back and forth. And then being also aware of what you're doing. Because you're sending them, too, it's a relational field. 

00:50:05
RICH SIMON So, let's get the, we have about, uh, 10 minutes or so here. 

00:50:10
DIANE HELLER Oh, gosh it went so fast. 

00:50:10
RICH SIMON So, uh, what. Hey, in secure attachment time disappears. 

00:50:20
DIANE HELLER It does. 

00:50:20
RICH SIMON And so, when you get triggered, so this is, this kind of therapy is not everybody's t-, cup of tea. Many of us don't want to pick up, you know, 24/7, um, in, in, in therapy terms. So, when we get triggered or how do? What's, what's involved in the therapist being able to maintain this kind of receptivity and what happens when it gets jammed up? Because your clients have a lot more capacity to shift your relational field in the kind of work that you're describing. 

00:50:55
DIANE HELLER Well, first of all sometimes, especially if there's trauma mixed in you're gonna get an activation injections, you know, from their story and from their state and from their terror or anger or whatever. And so, partly it's like learning to keep your seat, that's a saying from Buddhism. 

00:51:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:51:05
DIANE HELLER Keep your seat even while you're on the wild horse, you know. And sometimes I can, you know my clients dissociate and I can feel myself lifting off the seat a little bit to dissociate with them. I'm like, that's not gonna be helpful. 

00:51:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:51:15
DIANE HELLER So, I go OK Diane let's land, you know, ground, land. 

00:51:20
RICH SIMON Only one dissociater at the consulting office at one time. Okay. 

00:51:20
DIANE HELLER Yeah, the only, yeah. You can go but I need to stay, you know. 

00:51:25
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:51:25
DIANE HELLER So, so, you want to track yourself so part of it is you're focused on the other person but you're regulating yourself at the same time. 

00:51:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:51:30
DIANE HELLER And then also if there's a repair that needs to happen, you're checking the attunement. Like sometimes you might misuse the way you say something it doesn't come out quite right. You want to catch those things and practice repair and even actually if you do a successful repair that's going to be more meaningful to the person than the fact that you made the mistake 00:51:50]usually, you know. 

00:51:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm, good. 

00:51:45
DIANE HELLER Because people often don't repair. 

00:51:45
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:51:45
DIANE HELLER So, you might even have a whole thing come out of that. Um, but regulating oneself and also, um, sometimes you have to wait. If you get triggered in some part of your brain goes into, you know, uh, impatient response or frustrated response. Sometimes this can happen, I mean, we're human. Right? 

00:52:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:52:05
DIANE HELLER But sometimes I find even if the right words are coming to my mouth like I know the probably the language of what I want to say but I'm not coherent yet. I'm still in my irritation, or I'm still in my impatience. 

00:52:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:52:20
DIANE HELLER I've learned just to be quiet even if difficult things are happening during that quiet. I just go OK be quiet, get still, get centered until those two match up more I'm congruently in a specific state and my words match it then it will tend to be helpful. I've just learned this from, from messing it up many times. I've learned it over the years. So, things like that and, and then sometimes I'm, I will actively say you know we've got this kind of angry, difficult thing happening right now let's see if we can put that in the middle of the room. 

00:52:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:52:50
DIANE HELLER And you and I can look at it together. 

00:52:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:52:55
DIANE HELLER So, I literally position us as allies. 

00:52:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:52:55
DIANE HELLER Looking at the fact that they're upset about this or that or they're in this difficult space. I'll actually shape the structure of how we're dealing with it as here we are together looking at this and gosh. When if we stick it out here what happens when you look at it out here? 

00:53:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:53:15
DIANE HELLER You know, and what I'm seeing, you know, and what are you seeing. So, I try to do some things that kind of keep us going in a secure attachment direction. Or I might even go, you know, remember before when you were feeling more relaxed notice how different this is. 

00:53:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:53:25
DIANE HELLER So, I might be doing things like that just to keep it experiential but also relevant in terms of the content, what they're trying to work on. 

00:53:30
RICH SIMON So, it, in, uh, we're coming to the end here and maybe if we could. So, you've given us a very, vivid picture and feel of what goes on here. The back and forth in the dance and the way in which, uh, this moment to moment residence, this kind of relationship with a client. Let's, as, as I'm tracking this. So, this is, you know, we're still, we could get a fresh session here, a lot is going on. 

00:54:00
DIANE HELLER I know. Yeah. 

00:54:00
RICH SIMON Cause there's a lot of experience, a lot of intensity. Pulling back, what happens here when you see people over time. And what are some of the patterns of response? When, when this kind of ? Some people this is not their cup of tea, I imagine for some folks they get one session of this and this may be despite your most sensitive efforts they ain't coming back. This isn't what they, they're not ready to have this kind of, um, engagement with another person, um, I imagine. 

00:54:30
DIANE HELLER Well, part of that is learning as a therapist how to pace that. 

00:54:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:54:35
DIANE HELLER So, that it's not too much for somebody. 

00:54:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:54:35
DIANE HELLER Like a little can go a long way. Right. 

00:54:35
RICH SIMON Yeah, exactly. 

00:54:35
DIANE HELLER I'm kind of giving you a lot of information because of the time we have but you're pacing and dosing like, like sometimes you're doing homeopathic work. You know? Just a little bit. 

00:54:45
RICH SIMON A little bit. 

00:54:45
DIANE HELLER But over time, you know, the secure attachment system is such a vital part of us. 

00:54:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:54:50
DIANE HELLER It's so connected to aliveness and our capacity to get in contact with who we really are and in contact with the authenticity of someone else. In this safer vulnerability it adds so much to people's lives even if they just get 10% more or 5% more. The changes that happen at a relatively efficient, a relatively short period of time. Um, it used to be attachment had this idea, people working with attachment that it had to take many, many years and long, long, long. But when you add neuroscience and how to get one part of the brain integrating with another part of the brain and that's another whole topic. Uh, how to get the nervous system regulated, how to get people experientially in a relational field in a more relaxed and fun and protected way. It's amazing the kind of changes. I, I just had a client that's been on disability for several years, seven or eight years from being a very high powered clinical director and he hasn't been able to work all this time. He's just been doing, uh, you know, maybe several sessions but he now can sit down and work for four hours a day. And he can also feel like he's actually receiving contact nutrition from some people in his life now. Not from his history and he's feeling very sad that it doesn't come from his history. 

00:56:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:56:00
DIANE HELLER It's a grief process. 

00:56:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:56:00
DIANE HELLER Because it is sad that it doesn't come from mom and dad. 

00:56:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:56:00
DIANE HELLER But he's opening up to all these people now. That he, that he's had in his life but never been able to feel. 

00:56:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:56:10
DIANE HELLER You know, and bit by bit he, his, the aliveness, his face, he looks younger, he looks really in his face. He couldn't see himself or recognize himself in a mirror. 

00:56:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:56:15
DIANE HELLER I mean, we're talking about a very strong adaptation away from contact. 

00:56:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:56:20
DIANE HELLER And what he's been able to do just over the summer. I mean, really it's incredible and I think this opportunity is there for most of us if not all of us to some extent. 

00:56:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:56:30
DIANE HELLER And as therapists we need it, too. You know? 

00:56:30
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:56:30
DIANE HELLER We're in a relational field, we're bring our relational history into every ar-, every situation. You can't not bring it in. 

00:56:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:56:40
DIANE HELLER So, it's exciting, I think. I think it's a very exciting development in our field. I'm excited and everybody that's doing stuff about it, I'm so grateful that they're doing what they're doing and I'm happy to be part of it 

00:56:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah, well you communicate that excitement really splendidly. Um, we're just, we're coming to the end for now and the, uh, I, let's take a moment here and so, so people eho are intrigued by what you're describing and this is they want to learn how, more about this kind of work and perhaps your work in particular. 

00:57:10
DIANE HELLER Okay. 

00:57:10
RICH SIMON Where do they go? 

00:57:10
DIANE HELLER Well, my website is the easiest thing. It's www.dianepooleheller.com 

00:57:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:57:20
DIANE HELLER And, um, we've got some things happening on the East Coast in Connecticut in February. Where I'm combining trauma, attachment and spiritual work. And then I have my regular, uh, Dynamic Attachment Repatterning Experience trainings cause they are experiential as well as a lot of information and a lot of clinical application. Cause my whole thing's about how do understand us and what do you do with somebody sitting in front of you. 

00:57:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:57:40
DIANE HELLER And, uh, so, we're trying to make that a very practical and pragmatic for folks and those we have happening all over Europe and a lot in the United, United States. So, my website gives a pretty good breakdown of it, and people can find a lot there. 

00:57:50
RICH SIMON Great, Okay. 

00:57:50
DIANE HELLER Yeah. 

00:57:55
RICH SIMON And, uh, uh, this, we're kicking off our webcast series so let me just say this and you'll hear me say this in the weeks to come, but, uh, in no case will it be more relevant than here there's a comment board at the bottom of your screen so if you have a thought that has been triggered by this conversation. If you have a question. If you made some insight or observation connecting the dots whatever it is could scarcely be irrelevant to this discussion and keep the conversation, which began here with Diane, keep it going amongst us. So, go on up and, and we wanna hear for your own benefit and the benefit of the group let's hear from you. And, uh, Diane is nothing as she's demonstrated here if not responsive. So, she'll certainly take a look at this comment board and you may well get a response from the lady herself, about this, uh, if she is so moved. But in any case, um, that's a big part of this learning experience. So, please as many of you as possible take advantage of this comment board. Diane, thank you, I, my, my explicit and implicit systems, my, uh, attachment system are working at a higher level of functioning as a result of having this opportunity to hang out with you. Thank you so much. 

00:59:05
DIANE HELLER Very cool. Thank you so much Rich and it's wonderful to be in your healing tribe as well as supporting it other places. 

00:59:10
RICH SIMON All right tribe members. 

00:59:15
DIANE HELLER Yes. 

00:59:15
RICH SIMON So, just the tribe gathers again next time and continue on in this journey of Attachment Theory in Action. See you then. Thank you. Bye. Bye. 

00:59:20
DIANE HELLER Thank you. Bye.
