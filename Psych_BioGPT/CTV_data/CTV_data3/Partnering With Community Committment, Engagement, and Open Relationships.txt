REBECCA L. TOPOREK Thank you and thank you all of you who came here today. Ummm… I really appreciate having a little bit of an audience and so many of them being friends already, that helps. Ahh… just one other little bit of housekeeping I think is that our volunteers gonna be distributing evaluations toward the end of this session. So, umm… she asked that I ask you to be sure to fill those out. Ummm… and what I will try to do is leave sometime for questions and I guess it will be helpful to circulate the microphone if anybody has any questions. Ummm… but I have a lot actually that I wanted to talk about. So, I’m just gonna go ahead and get started with that. Umm… I just wanna say, ahh… brief thing about the title and the title has to do with as you see… umm… a lot of thoughts that I’ve been having about community engagement. I started off as a even prior going to my doctoral degree, being really interested in multicultural counseling and getting really invested(ph) and involved in it and realizing that one of the aspects that I was really, really interested in was the advocacy piece and the working toward justice piece which then led me into social justice and social justice and multicultural competence led me into really the need to communicate or to engage meaningfully with communities and so… ummm… as the introduction said I was a part of… ummm… the Society for Counseling Psychologies, Community Engagement Committee, before it was Community Engagement Committee and I want to acknowledge my (inaudible ) here who had actually asked me to be on that what was the special task group then… ummm… what that experience did was to give me a experience with community engagement, that of course maybe different than what was written enough in a lot of literature and so what I hope to do today is talk a little bit about that. "Gee, I’ll never travel to Malaysia and close a sweatshop; I’m not brave enough (or organized or articulate enough) to champion a cause. I have to go to work every day, and I just don’t have the time or the gifts to be a virtuous [or engaged[ person." That’s from Goska in a chapter called political paralysis from a book that I really like called "The impossible will take a little while" and this is a chapter where she talks about some frustration, but also is really encouraging people to do something about whatever it is that needs to be done about justice issues and hearing so much from people that… ummm… they just don’t have enough power, they just don’t have the time, they just don’t have the resources to really do something about homelessness or injustice or discrimination or whatever. So, as you'll see I have a number of things from her, because I think she is really brilliant. So, really this talk is coming from questions that I have and struggles that I have in trying to understand how to do community engagement and social justice and multicultural work in a way that’s meaningful and so I come to you not with a lot of answers or way to do it or a model or any of that, I come to you with kind of the questions that have been raised for me and as somebody who was really trying to think of the ethical and practical applications of the way that we do community engagement and social justice. And so I’m stumbling felt like a got an allergy for me. Ummm… stumbling by also a sense of conviction. So, I believe in it. It’s important to me yet I don’t quite know how to do it. So, stumbling through conviction relevance. I believe that we have a responsibility to be relevant as psychologists, as counselors, as mental health practitioners. I also believe we have a responsibility to be culturally aware. I also believe that communities are expert on their needs, their resources and their strategies and I believe that communities are in the best position to tell us how to be relevant. When I talk a little bit more about some of those pieces as we go on. I also wanted to mention a little bit about social justice, ummm… because that term is thrown around a lot. A heard earlier today, ummm… that social justice is not very popular. One of the things that I found is that the term social justice actually right know is very popular whether acting in social justice is popular are not, I don’t know, but using the term social justice is. So, I wanna be sure that to let you know how I’m defining it. And so… Stumbling through conviction into social justice. Ummm… and defining that as working toward equity in access to resources. Ummmm… and that’s a very brief definition, but I think it encompasses the definitions of a lot of different people in terms of looking at what is social justice. So, in stumbling towards social justice as I indicated earlier, I believe that we as professionals, we as educators, we have access to resources. I also believe the community has access to resources and I believe if we can bring those resources together in a meaningful way that we can actually do a lot. I have two hypotheses or assumptions that I think are important to share. One is that I think within psychology… our emphasis on the individual has allowed us to dismiss structural oppression and I think it’s also allowed us to discount the centrality in the wisdom of communities. Because we stay so focused on the individual, we tend to neglect what the community really brings. I think the other that’s happened just… from my personal experience and observations in my education and in my training, is that the ethical and practical complexities of partnering with communities often discourages us from even trying. That it’s complex, it’s difficult, it’s hard and so we don’t do it. So here is some things I’ve heard from myself, from my students, from people that I've encountered in workshops. I will, I really will when things slow down a little bit. Or what can I really do? What if I make things worse? I’m not sure I know how to do it right. So should I still do it? Going back to Goska, "Virtue’ is defined as so outside of normal human experience or ability that you’d think, if you were doing it night, you’d know, because camera crew and awards committee would appear on your lawn." And I think this is so… this is actually for me really good having followed this morning’s planetary session, because as a professional before going into my doctoral program I met and saw many of those people who were, elders on that stage and many others who were in the audience and I was awe struck and overwhelmed at that, Oh my gosh! They do so much. They challenge so much. They’re so like bigger than life and… and that can be a little intimidating… and so I think that… that one of the things that I and… and other people are encountered do is that ummm… it is… it’s a big thing. It’s celebrities do it. It’s not something that plain little people here do… umm… and what can we really do? Goska also says, "The problem is not that we have so little power. The problem is that we don’t use the power that we have." And for me that’s a really important piece and that’s were engaging with communities can really come in, because I as an individual have some access to resources. I have some… some power within systems. They also though have some of that and so together we can began to… if we could began to use the power that we have, we can actually do a lot more. So, there are two really main things that I wanted to touch on today. One is the idea of a continuum of community engagement and the other piece is looking in more depth at the process of developing community partnerships. So, I wanna spend a little bit of time talking about this idea of a continuum and it goes back to… to the previous comment that I made about people who do work, who do social justice work, who really impact communities and individuals and families lives, it seems really big. And one of the things in the community engagement literature and social justice literature is that; for example, in Goodman and her colleagues work… which I think is really pivotal and really, really important and their principals to go by that… I think are really useful and at the same time present a big picture of that, if I am going to do social justice and community engagement. There is a lot that I need to take into account. But I think at the same time with my Michael and mine and our other committees work through division 17 engaging with New Orleans, San Francisco, Boston, Toronto and San Diego that we actually have seen meaningful impact in engagements that are fairly short. So I just want to share with you this continuum and sort of what… what’s represented on here. It’s really a continuum that’s meant to communicate the extent of emotion and engagement, length of time with particular projects or community partners. And I have on the far end on the low skinny end of the continuum, the 'Give Back' initiative from Division 17 and I have it on that end because the way that their project works… umm… is that every year we move to a different city because the convention moves to a different city and the idea is that… umm… SCP, the Society for Counseling Psychology should meaningfully contribute to each community where we have conventions. So practically what that means is we move to a different city each year. So, in the fall we began to try to identify community partners in the city where we will be having convention in the following August. Umm… we rapidly try to locate, figure out, talk to, engage, share with the community… potential community partners what we have to offer and ask what is it that they think the community needs there? Over the course of doing this for a few years, what we found is what’s… what we can do is to really try to identify community partners who are committed to social justice, who have that apparent in their mission, they are very clearly are set up and already doing that and one of the things that’s important, we also have found there is that partnering with us actually requires a big commitment on their part. Umm… it’s not an easy thing on both of the ends. There is a lot of work to be done and so an organization needs to be set up in a way that they can actually participate with us. So, just to give an example of what we did in New Orleans was the first one that… that we worked with. It was 2006 and Katrina and Rita had recently happened so, a lot of internet lines were down, phone lines were down and lot of agencies were closed and lot of people were gone from the community. It took us a long time to really try to find some community partners and we eventually did. And we found two really amazing groups. One was the New Orleans Mental health and Resilience task force and they had a person and who was dedicated to trying to figure out where were the mental health services now, post Katrina? Who had the services? Who had beds? Who had… and there are so many who was an amazing grass roots organizer trying to pull all this information together. So, she was really excited to work with us. Because she was seeing a lot of trauma among the mental health providers that were there and she were… and they also were not able to get see ease, because everything had been decimated so they were in danger of losing their licenses. So, she was really interested. We also had a partner with the Louisiana Children’s Museum and they had in their insight hired somebody specifically to co-ordinate volunteer efforts and so that was perfect for us because here was somebody who had the resources to work with us. So, we offered at the Children’s Museum, we were able to offer workshops for parents, children’s, school personnel about children coping with trauma and then we were also able to offer to the mental health provider community daylong workshop on co-trauma and stress and self care. So that was our New Orleans, that was probably what Michael we have the partnership in March and got it all set up by August and then carried it out in August and a week before the event all the power went out in the venue that we were going to provide. So, our community partner this is one of the reasons as important. She had to go find an alternative venue at the last minute to host the hundred people umm… and actually that happened in Toronto as well. So, it is very… Toronto was the garbage strike but it’s, I think interesting that happened twice in a period of four years. Umm… so that’s… that’s on the end of the small end of the continuum because like I said we have very short time period to engage with the partner to learn about what their needs were? We needed to rely on them extensively for an understanding of the community, what the community needed? And then really to help what with logistics, they knew how to publicize within their market. We were really trying to bring the expertise in terms of presenters, facilitators, whatever support we could bring to the event. Out of that, grew some different things that the person I mentioned at the New Orleans Mental Health and Resilience task force, Sarah Hoffpauir and I continued a relationship after that. I check in with her how are things going? And she ended up in a position where she was responsible for work force retention and recruitment, which given that my areas career counseling and my master's thesis was on counselor Bernard, I was really excited about that because I felt like I actually knew something this time. And so, she and I started talking what we found was that in the Bernard literature there was nothing that came close to describing the situation they were in New Orleans. the closest thing we could find was Bernard in war torn areas which wasn’t really New Orleans and so I said to her that "let me try to call this person who I don’t know, but respect (inaudible ) done a lot on Bernard and that’s (inaudible ), you see Berkeley's written a lot about Bernard over the last 20… 25 years. So, I contacted her and said "do you know of any literature that comes close to what’s happening in New Orleans?" and she said "No, I don’t, but you know I’d be interested in talking with you all further about that." Really exciting. She is actually the one I based my master's thesis on. So, so… we set up a time to meet with her and she brought another colleague who does all kinds of work around the world, in South Africa and all kinds of places, looking at Bernard and work force retention. So, we were able to develop a research team, they were very interested in what Sarah needed to do there and developed a research project for her to try to access what was going on and make some recommendations and do some consulting with the organizations around how to maintain the workforce. And so I put this more in the middle because a lot of it was done virtually, it was done over a longer period of time. But there was the extend of emotion and my involvement with the community was by distance really and it was in kind of bits and pieces. The one on this far end, and I want to talk a little bit more and this is the one that I’m gonna focus on more when I talk about the process of developing relationship because for me personally this has been the most intensive community engagement umm… project that I’ve been involved with. This was 7 Tepees pro… which was a program in San Francisco in the Mission District. It’s a Non-profit Organization that works with kids, ages or from grades 6 to 12 and their intend to engage kids in meaningful activities where they can sort of find their sense of self, their sense of purpose become more successful in school, learn about the world outside of their neighborhood and find kind of their sense of energy who they are? And feel umm… get ready for their transition to adulthood. And so a few years ago, the director of the program contacted me and asked me, umm… if… if I had any thoughts about her developing a new program and whether we might start an internship. So, I’d like to talk a little bit more about… about that. Ahh… that was how… how our relationship started and I’m just gonna jump forward a couple of years before going into the relationship building to tell you how this piece of it came together. Dr. Ponterotto and Dr. Suzuki Dr. Casas and Dr. Alexander as you know have the multi cult… the Handbook of Multicultural Counseling and for this last edition Dr. Ponterotto contacted me and asked if I was in writing a chapter on social justice beyond the university and I said, "sure, that sounds great" and I thought about it and thought it was this 7 Tepees thing would be a really good thing to write about, because we are in the community. I’m trying to help them work on that. the only difficulty was I wasn’t feeling very successful in this process, in working with them and I felt like they were lot of stumbling blocks and I hadn’t found very much literature to help me in this work, but I set out go ahead and do it anyway. And so, what I decided to do was to ask Diane Dodge, the director of 7 Tepees, if she wanted to write the chapter with me and we could write it together and knowing full rather, probably what would happen is lot of the difficulties I was having in developing this partnership might actually come out as she and I talked about writing this chapter and sure enough that’s what happened but it wasn’t just me. It was on her side too and so in the process of writing this chapter a lot of things came out on the table that we’d never shared with each other before about working together and as we were talking about what has it been like developing this, Diane said, "you know this is sounding a lot like dating" and then she talked about it, I laughed and I said, "you know you are right." Now, I have to disclose that I mentioned in this session earlier, I have been in a relationship with someone for 26 years and so, really when I think about it in my life I’ve only dated about four years, but psychologically it takes up a huge amount of space. So, I think I remember something about dating. So, as she and I talked about the whole process this is kind of the stages that we talked about that. I think kind of fit a little bit. So, initially we had our budding romance, Diane contacted me, she said, "I see that you are the career counseling co-ordinator at San Francisco State and "we just got this grant to develop these two programs in local high schools. Umm… we do it already had our program, we have the money. We know what we wanna do. Just wanted to know if you had any thoughts about, you know how we might do this?" And we also want to talk about maybe developing an internship. So I said, "oh sure!" knowing that I’ve ten other projects also on my plate right now, but I’m really committed to being involved in the community and it will be good thing for my students. Also, to have the internship and to really branch out into program that I thought was really exciting. They take the kids out snowboarding. They go out on these camping trips and these are kids that have never loved the Mission District before. Kids who were in a group that have a very low high school graduation rates and this program just seemed really exciting. So attraction, a lot of curiosity, how do they do it? And honestly some fear and the fear being a number of things. One is I’m a white women. I did not grow up in the Mission District. I didn’t even grow up in San Francisco, even when I was in adolescent I didn’t understand adolescence. It’s not really the group of people who I identify with very much. But I really thought this seemed like a great program. So, fear of would I be useful? Would I be relevant? Would I really have anything to offer them? And also fear that, I’ve ten other projects on my plate. Am I really gonna be… are they gonna want more than what I can actually give? Do I feel like I need to give more than what I can? So, ultimately the question was for each of us is this the match? You know we are gonna take in and look see how is this something that’s gonna work? Then we kind of move into the phase of well, it’s looking pretty good. Is it gonna work? Where is it going? How is this going to be? So, she and I both shared that, we were testing the waters a little bit. We throw a little thing out, see how the other would react. And then started to say, Okay! Okay! and then take the plunge a little bit. In the first part there was a lot of trying to build trusts. Do we have what it takes to build a successful relationship? And both she and I shared, it’s was really funny. That we each at different times we are like, "what she sense this? What is she really thinking? Like what is she really mean? You know she said on the last phone call, she stopped and said "okay well I'm going to be busy for couple of weeks, so I won't be able to call," does that means she doesn’t want it to do it anymore? You know all kinds of things like just flashbacks, you know. Umm… and so… and also, really wanting to show the work committed, me wanting to show that I’m a good, you know contributor, I’m a psychologist who actually understands how to do things and I'm a way of person that is willing to learn and to be there even though I know am not at all the same as the kids that she is working with. And then on the other part… and this is I think really, from my perspective I can identify with this. That I think that for Diane being very protective of the kids she was working with, it’s kind of proved to me that you are committed. Umm… but she didn’t want to ask too much because she didn’t want to scare me away. And so for me, I think the way that prove to me you are committed really came out was answer the phone calls, when I call like you know, if you’re really are committed to working with me then if I email you, I think if you email me back then I think you are committed, if you don’t then I’m not really sure whether you are or not. And so then we move into Trouble in Paradise. And what’s really going on. So that we had some periods there were, as I said I have ten other projects going on and they contact me and say right in the middle of (inaudible ) or you know sometime when… it doesn’t really work that well with my schedule and so I say, "Okay! I’ll get back you know, as soon as I can." So I take a little while to get back to her. But also they were months actually, they had hired somebody to co-ordinate the whole college career program that they were starting and we contact him and we wouldn’t hear anything back and we’d offer these models or other programs, David Blustein's program in Boston, other programs that he could look at us, he was building and we wouldn’t hear anything back and so sort of like, do they really want our help? Or are we really not relevant? And you know what’s going on? Umm… so what… what we decided myself and two graduate students who are interested in working on it was that we would try to figure out from them what they wanted. We had done a memorandum of understanding, but it really didn’t kind of cover what we were encountering and so we decided as our little research group that we would find out what they wanted and if it was a concrete product, we would create it and we will give it to them and if they wanted to use it, fine, if they didn’t, fine. But we wouldn’t sort of keep trying to demand from them too much. We were just trying to find ways to give and offer help to them. There was also as I mentioned some approach avoidance kind of behaviors where, Diane would be really excited about us working together and then she say "but you know, we’ve got the money covered, you know we are okay, we are good, we are good" and I sort of didn’t know what that meant. Does that mean she doesn’t really want my help? Or that is not useful or? What is that really mean? In the process of writing the chapter what I found out from her she said, "I really wanted your help. I really wanted you engaged, but I didn’t wanted to seem too needy. I didn’t want you to run away. I didn’t you to seem like you know, oh they can't, so I wanted you to think like we have our stuff together. Like we knew what we were doing and so… so I was trying not be too demanding." In the way I interpreted that of course was well they don’t really need me umm… and so in both I think vice versa was the other sort of way, that I was saying I was not wanting to impose. So, I would give some things to them but I didn’t want to intrude in their household. You know, I didn’t want to jump up in and start messing with their family and I think that was perceived kind of as a how committed is she really? Now, in this phase of it, one of the break through things that happened is that, there was a meeting, we periodically had meetings in person and it was sometimes difficult because we are located in very different parts of the city and my philosophy was always what I assumed was that I should be going out into the community that I shouldn’t be setting out meetings in my office that it should really be out there where they are. But there was one day when Diane was on campus for something else and so we said, "well, why don’t we go ahead and meet?" and so she came up to my office and we had a meeting and then later when we were writing the chapter she said, "you know that was the pivotal point. That was when I knew I wanted to work with you. When we were in your office, because I could see all the things on your wall and I could see the books on your bookshelf" and we had a short conversation in that meeting where she was talking about the youth and how they have experiences that they can’t really explain and they sometimes don’t validate the… she was talking about micro aggressions, but not using those words and I said, "you know that’s… that’s sounds like micro aggression." I said "you know I got this great article this morning. I actually just made a copy for my class, but here let me give you a copy." Then we talked about micro aggressions and all of that and when we were writing the chapter Diane said, "you know, when you gave me that article and you understand what I was talking about, I knew that you had some knowledge and you could relate to some extent about what our kids were going through and it wasn’t until I was in your office and I wasn’t until you have that article right there, that I felt like I really wanted to do this." So, that’s kind of where we got to. Umm… was sort of re-calibrating. So saying, okay Diane came and said you know what "we had to fire that guy. He just wasn’t doing the work." Oh! It was personally she said it wasn't(ph) me. Okay, umm… and I kind of came and I said, you know "I’ve had these ten projects but you know what I’m really committed and I’m gonna get some of them off my plate so I can spend more time and I’m gonna start coming down to the center and really a recommitment and saying okay, if I actually care about this, if I really wanted to do this, I’m gonna have to shift the way that I’m doing my work and I’m really… I’m just gonna have to make the commitment to do this. Umm… and so, also at this point was some of them meeting their family which was there is a graduation ceremony for the students. I’m gonna be there. Dr. Parham was so generous and kind he came up to San Francisco for another event and he squeezed us in so he came and spoke with the high school kids, umm… and so we did a lot more in terms of really trying to meet the family, get together more often. So, I wanted to really elaborate on that process because one of the things that I found in doing reading about community engagement was that there wasn’t that much really about the relational part of it, for me and as a person doing something fairly new outside at the realm of what I commonly do. I wasn’t trained in community organizing, umm… I was trained a little bit in terms of consultation and prevention but more within scope of counseling psychology. There is not as much emphasis on that is what I like. And so I’m right now really interested in learning more about the process of how do we develop these relationships? What is that process like? How is it for both parties? And I really interested in it from a relation perspective, but I’m also really interested in it from an ethics perspective. Because I think there are very significant ethical issues in terms of how we insert yourselves in communities? In terms of how we engage with communities? And I think they really are two cultures there and umm… at least then I defining culture in terms of language; the language we used to describe our experiences, the way that we prioritize our values, the way that we use time as an academic; my time is relatively flexible, I can come, I can go. I have trouble meeting sometimes with my community partner, but she is got to be there from 8 until 3, because that’s when school is there and that’s when the college career center is open and so you know they are different things. So, I want to just maybe take another five minutes or so and talk about some of the lessons learned through the continuum and so some of these lessons are from the give back initiative and some of them are from working with 7 Tepees. So, Michael and I, when we were working on trying to establish a set of principles that we thought the community engagement, giving back to the community ought to really hold by that it ought to be a principled effort and not just the service. We did a lot of research trying to find some things from community engagements. So, these principles sort of evolved out of several different sources one was Goodman and her colleagues, as I mentioned but also the Scottish National Standards for Community Engagement and the commission for community engaged scholarship in the health professions. So, we did find more in terms of public health as a discipline, a little bit in terms of counseling psychology but really other disciplines. So, some of the principles that we felt were really important in that short term engagement process were having a sociopolitical and cultural consciousness of community needs. So, really understanding the community we were going into and what were the cultural needs of that community? That's really critical in terms of New Orleans and the contextual factors that were important in New Orleans. The following year we went to San Francisco and asked somebody who lives in San Francisco, I had a really difficult time shifting to say, "well, we haven’t had a giant earthquake, thank goodness. We haven’t… there was not one problem within San Francisco, there are bunch of problems and so you know how do we go? It’s not unlike any other urban area in that way. So, really being aware of the cultural aspects of the community and coming with some information but then being informed enough to know that the community really needs to help us understand what those needs are. The other thing is sharing information and power. So, doing the partnership in a way that the community has power and information, we are not dictating what’s going to happen, but we do it in kind of a mutual way. Umm… also coming in with the strength-based stance, looking at assets and wanting to work with the communities assets as supposed to looking at the community from a deficit model, that they don’t have this or they don’t have that, but what do they have? And how come we do something that’s gonna help build on that and help strengthen that? Try to do something that even though we are there for very short time what can we do that will help have a lasting impact? And then finally one of the things that we came to that we could actually do is amplify voices of the community. In other words, the community has a voice, so we are not giving them the voice. They have a voice, but we have access to other outlets. We have this large organization called APA. We have access to the media in a different way than they do. Umm… we can really amplify the issues that they are seeing and one of the things that’s really quickly from New Orleans umm… Sarah kept saying we want and this was actually true from the other partners and the other people who had attended the workshops saying "we want the rest of the nation to know that Katrina is not over. We want them to know that New Orleans is still having a lot of problems and actually if we were to go back right now we would hear similar things. Umm… so that was one of the things they wanted from us. With 7 Tepees there is some other lesson that I learned, that I think are important in build on some of the things that I just talked about. One of them is Diane talked later about the importance of a win-win situation and the importance of being clear about the win-win situation. Part of her process early in our relationship development when she said she spent a lot of time trying to figure out, what was it that I wanted out of this? And I felt from my general socialization and I don’t know Catholic upbringing whatever it was, that I shouldn’t actually be going out asking them for something, I ought to be there for them. Even though implicitly I knew it was good for my career to be involved in the community, my university really values that umm… and it was good for my students and what’s good for my students is good for me. Umm… so I knew that, but I didn’t really communicate that to her because I really wanted to hear what did they need? And how could I help their needs? But may not explicitly talking about what I was getting out of it, was getting in the way actually because then it required her to spend time trying to figure out, what my ulterior mode of was? So I think in the community engagement I think it’s really important to be explicit about what each party wants out of this process. Not necessarily has to be in a selfish way. Umm… their consistent involvement and communication is important and that varies depending on the settings, so like I said for the give back we are not in the city necessarily. So, lot of the communication has to be by phone, by email etc. Whereas if it is a local community like 7 Tepees, I actually have to be there physically. I keep trying to set up phone meetings and it just does not work, really it does not work and so when we meet in person we get so much more. Umm… really spending time to clarify roles, time, resources and expectations, understanding that we have different organizational cultures and that’s gonna impact the way that we work together and then consider there is a long-term and dynamic process particularly with a local partner. So, just the quick thing which is this really isn’t new and umm… makes it a little difficult for me to talk about because I’m… I haven’t created anything that’s new. I know there are lot of other people who have done this work. So, why wasn’t I trained on it? You know I feel like there is a big gap in terms of, what we are doing? I felt like it was important. I was working by the seat of my pants. I think that one of the difficulties as there are lot of our training programs don’t integrate interdisciplinary perspectives, interdisciplinary resources and so that’s what I would really like emphasis, I think that’s important. I also want to just mention the journal for social action in Counseling and Psychology, because I think one of the other difficulties is that the lot of our publications, lot of the places where we publish research on community engagement type activities and social justice is so focused on the outcome that we don’t really spend time talking about the process and one of the nice things about this journal is that we have the possibility of doing that, of talking about process, of talking about relationship, of talking about engagement umm… and not necessarily having to jump to outcome in a confined number of pages. So, I really want to encourage anybody who knows anybody who is doing social action research to consider or call for social action research manuscripts. We were be going to be doing a special issue on that. So, the last thing I just want to say is, in terms of engaging with the community I think we have to acknowledge the complexities are really important. I think we need to train for it and I think we need to do it. I’m gonna end with that and just see if there are any questions or comments or other work that you are doing it’s really exciting and useful to hear about.

 So my question is how… how she was able to justify the time that she votes(ph), to what she is doing in the community, to her colleagues? Because I assume that takes her way for community work and writing(ph) and all the other things that we were asked do (inaudible )? 

00:41:26
REBECCA L. TOPOREK Right. I think that… that’s a really good question. It’s a really important question. Umm… there are couple of things that I can say to you that one is that I’m really fortunate to be at a university that has in its mission statement social justice and it also sets community engagements. So, even though I might not believe the university always sticks by that, I can always say "well, look it is on the mission statement." And also that I’m really fortunate to be in a department with other colleagues who are very engaged with communities and committed. The other thing is that the way our masters program is set up is that students must be in the field for two full academic years and so being engaged with the community really helps that process. If we're not engaged in the community we can't run our program, because then we don’t have relationships with community. So, that’s part of it. I think the other thing is in terms of the tenure process umm… the engaged scholarship model is a really important one to look at and in terms of developing the tenure and retention criteria within the university having that model implicit in there, is really useful because then it gives credibility to community engagement in a different way than if it’s a byproduct. If it’s something you are doing on this side. But if it’s seen as an integral part of scholarship, now one of the difficulties with that is that umm… for tenure retention as such how you are supposed to be producing publications. Hence the journal for social action which is that you don’t need to… you can publish on the process. You don’t have to wait five six ten years until you develop the partnership. They are our ways to publish the work that you are doing with the community and to engage the community even in the participatory process that can help sort of pacify the university and the system there. But it’s not easy, I think in general, it’s just not easy. That’s part of the reason I’ve been working with 7 Tepees for three years and I feel like we just barely have been dating for two weeks in terms of where we are in our relationship. So… 

00:43:35
 Then what was it like meeting the family? 

00:43:40
REBECCA L. TOPOREK Ha…ha…ha…. Ahh… it continues to be very nerve-racking. But it’s got to the point where I’d actually really like to bring my daughter. So, I go to… and it’s nerve-racking for several reasons. One is probably the closet to dating analogy which is I go there and I try really hard not to think about what do they think of me and you know are my pants straight and all those kind of things. But also you know people wondering why I’m there? Because not everybody knows who I’m. So when I go to big events where it’s families and the kids and like their graduation ceremonies, there is 150 people there and I’m not the center of attention. I don’t really… I don’t want to be the center of attention and so Diane often will introduce me, but I kind of try to shrink back into the background, because I don’t think that’s my place to really be upfront in center. And I’m also very conscious of being a white women in an organization that is not and Diane is also white and so we’ve talked about how is this that we are both white and are doing this? The person I were utmost closely now Kym Glanville who was the director of the college career program is an African-American women, a Jamaican-American women and so we’ve also talked about that and the racial dynamics that happen within the agency and I’ve also talked to her about me as kind of a third party also a white person and the triangulation concerns. So there are lot of complexities we haven’t gone to yet but some of it I think is I need to meet the family more and I would really love for my daughter to meet the family too. 

00:45:15
 I love the dating analogy I think that’s really an interesting way to propose that, but I was wondering if you had any advice for anybody who is just sort of getting started out in terms of how would you get your foot in the door in something like that and collaborating with the community. 

00:45:30
REBECCA L. TOPOREK Hmm… hmm… that’s a great question. And I asked that question at an APA about eight years ago and the response that I got was really frustrating for me, because I asked the very similar question. I just moved back to San Francisco and asked that question and the person said, "oh well, go to a community college. There are lots of poor people there" and I was really offended because as a community college counselor I know the fact. And I also I thought it was very demeaning in condescending to the people who were there and I felt like she didn’t really understand my question, which was how to develop a meaningful relationship. So, umm… I'm not gonna tell you that answer. Instead what I’m gonna say is there are so many different opportunities to become engaged with communities and it takes time and so what I would recommend is look at what are organizations in your community that are doing things that you believe in? And go and see if you can volunteer there, cleaning the bathroom, sweeping the floors, whatever it is umm… and to be there for a while and observe what happens. Now, I got engaged with 7 Tepees in a very different way, but I’m also engaged in project almost connect in San Francisco and a number of other things where I have a very small part. I’m not a major player. I go, I volunteer on the events I send my students to volunteer on the events and it is a way for us to engage and it’s an opening. So, that if I actually did want to go in and start doing something more substitute, they already know me. They already know my intentions, they already know… it’s actually kind of like my relationship now which was we were friends for a long time before we became involved romantically now that I think about it. Umm… but I think that helps build the trust then, because you learn about it and you get a sense of how could I be helpful to this organization? But you don’t go and saying how you can be helpful. You start of and you do the basic things that need to be done. So, thank you all very much for coming this late in the day and good luck.
