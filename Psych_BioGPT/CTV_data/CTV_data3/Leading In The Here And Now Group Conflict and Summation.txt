AACD The Association for Specialists in Group Work, a division of the American Association for Counseling and Development presents GROUP WORK: LEADING IN THE HERE AND NOW Led by Dr. Peg Carroll, Professor of Counselor Education, Fairfield University Part III The Group in Conflict 

00:00:00
DR. PEG CARROLL  Anyone wanna start today? 

00:01:10
BRENDA I do. I felt that I have responded uhm, to Danuta when, ah, this is some time ago about mothering and being protective. I really thought I did that and uhm, and I know, I caught your eye a couple of times and so when you were feeling, you said that you were abandoned, ah, in a group. I just think, I was feeling inside, "Gee, I don't think I did that." But I wasn't willing to say that to you because I really didn't wanna, uhm, create anger. Or, you know, I didn't want, I just didn't wanna put that out. 

00:01:45
DR. PEG CARROLL  What do you want for yourself? 

00:01:50
BRENDA I like that feeling to go away. 

00:01:50
DR. PEG CARROLL You must get rid of nasty feelings. Anyone acting like that? 

00:01:55
 Yeah. 

00:01:55
GINNY No, it's just (inaudible ). I'm gonna have to pass. I don't feel nasty right now but I don't like nasty feeling. 

00:02:00
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:02:00
GINNY And I like to, to not have them and I'm going out of my way to avoid having them. 

00:02:05
JEAN Oh, I'm, I feel real nasty, I, and I'm not unhappy about it. I've been sitting here since we started this thing and I haven't been able to hear the feelings anymore because I was furious. I feel that the group that I knew has left and it became who bows most and I'm, I feel hurt, deserted. Where's the real, you know, I mean, I don't know what to say. I just. (crosstalk) 

00:02:35
DR. PEG CARROLL  You've didn't put out to pasture? 

00:02:40
JEAN Not I, feel, yeah, that I don't belong here. 

00:02:45
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:02:45
JEAN I don't feel that I have to be nice to everybody if I have a feeling that I'm angry but I go crazy when I think that, you know, it's, it's like a family and, and we've hurt each other all these hours and what are we doing? You know, how could I be the only be the person that is feeling this, this, it's a game to me now. 

00:03:05
ART  Uhm, I don't like what you said by the fact that uhm, we're all bowing. I don't feel bowing to anyone and I don't, I didn't like that statement because I felt that you're saying something about me. Ah, when I, when I said that I was really feeling for what I heard here, I was feeling very connected with uhm, both Danuta and Ron and I feel offended by that statement that I was bowing. 

00:03:40
MARY ANNE Yeah. I'm, I guess somehow, you difficulty too hearing it because I'm wondering, you said you were resistant after I really was concerned when Ron said, you know, it's, I'm usually cognitive and it's when I got into my own self that I was, because I was feeling things, that I, that I didn't respond to other people the way I was supposed to and, I don't know my impression when, when you were talk, he was talking at that, that time was that, you know, I'm not gonna do that again you know, ah, I should stay cognitive because, you know, then I don't get into myself and it was right after all that. And, anyway- (crosstalk) 

00:04:20
JEAN Uh hmm. 

00:04:20
MARY ANNE - was it after all that. You said I feel resisted. Well, well, I guess I'm angry because I feel like I'm trying to, to reveal and, and I, you know, there are a lot of feelings I could talk about right now but I feel like nobody else, or, no, I shouldn't say nobody else because that's not true. But I don't know what I'm feeling. I don't wanna talk anymore. 

00:04:40
JEAN That's, I talk to that- (crosstalk) 

00:04:45
 Okay. 

00:04:45
JEAN - because if I talk, I'm gonna bite somebody, you know, it's the same, I have the opposite. Instead, of stopping and, and pulling out, I'm gonna get angry but it's, it, it's me, it's not safe here anymore. 

00:04:55
BRENDA And so what if, if you get 

00:04:55
angry because, that, that now just a minute, the second thing, if I was starting to feel that I'm not hearing as much some other people and I'm starting to talk and I wanna hear somebody else say something. 

00:05:05
  Right. 

00:05:10
GINNY Jean, you said, (inaudible ) because of something one of us had done or something within you' 

00:05:15
DR. PEG CARROLL Mostly, women are questioned. You know, I'm having trouble in terms of where you are uhm, where are you? We (inaudible ), what is it that you wanna say Jean, what are you saying about yourself? 

00:05:25
LUCY There's nothing wrong with what you said was resistance and then you labeled later as anger. 

00:05:30
DR. PEG CARROLL  What are you saying about you? 

00:05:35
LUCY What am I, what am I think I'm feeling hurt because all of a sudden it's a game and I missed the track where it went off. Until I, you know, I know I process things slowly and I'm usually a step or two behind but I, you know that, I missed the boat. Where is everybody? I'm still on it. People are jumping off, I said to you it was okay to feel resistant but then you said later with anger. And then, I went along, you know, is it something that, that we've done, I've done, is it something I've done or is it something within you that you can't talk about to end this question. 

00:06:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Are you saying that you're concerned about your place here, that you're asking for Jean, where am I in relation to you or where am I in this group? 

00:06:15
LUCY Yeah, I guess so. Because you're, all of the sudden you labeled it as a game and I guess that makes I, I know it makes me uncomfortable. 

00:06:25
JEAN Well I, uhm, I don't uhm, I didn't come here to take on everybody's feelings. I came here to be myself. 

00:06:45
 Uh-huh. 

00:06:45
JEAN And I can't feel everybody all of the time and I'm comfortable with that. And I feel that the new change and I, if someone articulate, whether it's Danuta or Ron or anybody in here. But you too(ph) had earlier said things like that, that they had feelings that hadn't been picked up. I want to be able to say quite honestly, I like what I've heard from you. I'm glad you're here. I'm sorry I didn't feel that but I can't feel everything for everybody and instead of saying anybody say anything close to that, I hurt everybody. Now, I'm not saying what you said is not valid. Maybe everybody did come in and feel with these two people and maybe they didn't but I'm not so sure anymore. 

00:07:40
DR. PEG CARROLL Ah, Okay. Who is an important catalyst in this group? After, after as, as you see- (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
 Jean. 

00:07:45
DR. PEG CARROLL - here as a leader. Who is an important catalyst? 

00:07:50
 Jean. 

00:07:50
DR. PEG CARROLL Everyone, everyone have a different feeling? 

00:07:50
 I thought Danuta- (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
DR. PEG CARROLL Danuta? Uh hmm. 

00:07:55
 - she was the one who started the ball rolling- (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:07:55
 - (inaudible ) have dumped on the group and, and I think- (crosstalk) 

00:07:58
DR. PEG CARROLL  Okay. 

00:08:00
 - if that was guilt or anger. However, you wanna- (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:08:00
 - flow. 

00:08:00
DR. PEG CARROLL You think Danuta and how many said Jean? Three of you, four of you say Jean, anyone else? 

00:08:05
  I think Brenda. 

00:08:10
DR. PEG CARROLL And, you know, it's interesting, you see we have different people, I'm not gonna give you the answer to that but what wanna say is this, there's a reason, there's a good reason to that, as a leader, you have to make a decision and each one of you would make a different decision on the basis of who you decide, is someone who is important to, to be the catalyst, to have something happen and a catalyst means who is going to make it go? 

00:08:30
GAIL MORRIS  I would also wanna say that I see Mary Anne as a key factor in the group- (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
DR. PEG CARROLL  Uh hmm. 

00:08:40
GAIL MORRIS - rather than the two and not as a problem but as a catalyst. (crosstalk) 

00:08:40
DR. PEG CARROLL A catalyst or anyone else feel that way about Mary Anne? 

00:08:40
  I do too, you know. 

00:08:45
DR. PEG CARROLL A leader? 

00:08:45
 Uh-huh. 

00:08:45
DR. PEG CARROLL Right. 

00:08:45
HELEN SGOUROS I also feel that Art, uhm, is a catalyst and then you keep, regardless of what's going on in terms of conflict, he brings it back to the group. 

00:08:55
DR. PEG CARROLL What did you say, or did, what did you think about my stopping at the point I did? Is, did you feel, oh, was I going somewhere? No, not going any where, we're dealing with anger? 

00:09:05
  I start. 

00:09:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Great(ph). 

00:09:10
 (inaudible ). 

00:09:12
 We're starting but there's a (inaudible ). 

00:09:13
EILEEN MATTHAY I started real, revitalization when Jean just got it right- (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:09:15
EILEEN MATTHAY - (inaudible ) and everybody kinda woke up and I sit up in my chair and- (crosstalk) 

00:09:16
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:09:16
EILEEN MATTHAY - got back on target. 

00:09:20
 It was a real physical change- (crosstalk) 

00:09:20
 Yeah. 

00:09:20
 - among them. 

00:09:20
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:09:20
 They talk louder, they funk faster. 

00:09:25
DR. PEG CARROLL Yeah, uh-huh, okay. 

00:09:25
 Produce(ph) cases, cases started to get questioned. 

00:09:25
DR. PEG CARROLL All right. 

00:09:25
  It's interesting and, what Jean said. As soon as she said the word "a game," it was like everyone, a lot of people took offense to that- (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
DR. PEG CARROLL Hmm. Hmm. 

00:09:35
 - and almost took an insult to get people out of their status quo on thing- (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:09:35
 - get the whole thing moving. 

00:09:40
DR. PEG CARROLL Now sometimes, the leader can throw that out, uhm, but better for a member- (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:09:40
DR. PEG CARROLL - something like that, all right? This is our seventh session. (inaudible ) unless you have thought of what you might wanna deal with this week? 

00:09:55
RON I have one unresolved issue with Jean. Before you said, ah, "I came into this group to be myself," and I personally don't think I know who Jean is. 

00:10:05
JEAN I think uhm, I don't have as many (inaudible ) about what I do with my feelings and it gets me in trouble. I mean, really, I mean this is a whole group of nine people- (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:10:20
JEAN - and I'm the only one that's feeling that strong and I have to really work to keep the lead on. 

00:10:25
DR. PEG CARROLL  You're not strong. 

00:10:30
JEAN Sure, I mean, I not going to stand up and, and be that mad and have ah, you know, I don't know what I feel most on eight other people that won't shoot at me or eight people that will shoot at me, if you wait, it's- (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
DR. PEG CARROLL But you're right because- (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
 - gonna be real good. (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
DR. PEG CARROLL (inaudible ). 

00:10:41
JEAN I can't live with myself so- (crosstalk) 

00:10:41
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:10:41
JEAN - I don't wanna even sit here and be, you know, my blood is just boiling so I couldn't just so, you know, I mean, you can love me or hate me but ah, unfortunately, that's the way I feel about it. And I, I. (crosstalk) 

00:10:55
DR. PEG CARROLL You're kinda saying love me or hate me but do something. 

00:10:55
 Yeah, do something. Basic neglect. (crosstalk) 

00:11:00
MARY ANNE I understand what you're blood is boiling about because you said at first, all right, what if I heard you and correct you? You know, ah, all of a sudden ah, nobody's real anymore and I wanna be me and yet you almost so said, I don't want to deal with feelings. I'm comfortable not dealing with feelings and I, you know I, I thought I heard you saying, "I don't want to be forced into that- (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:11:20
MARY ANNE - and then you're saying but you know, love me, hate me, say something, I don't know what to say to you because I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want to do with feelings or up here or whatever but I'm gonna shut up because I am on a feeling level. So therefore, I should not participate because that would aggravate you. 

00:11:35
JEAN That's not true. And that's uhm,- (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
MARY ANNE But that's what you said. 

00:11:40
JANE - unfortunate that that sometimes, what's happening but I'm reacting to the should's. 

00:11:45
MARY ANNE  What should? 

00:11:50
JANE Danuta feels left out. I'm angry with your request that I felt from you, take care, you didn't take care of my feelings. It was an accusation that I picked up. Now that might be my bias, I have a point there. Someone else did pick it up and did feel with you. 

00:12:05
DANUTA Uh hmm. 

00:12:05
JANE  But every, I sensed that if everyone felt responsible to do it for you. I didn't. Could that be real that I am, you know, so different that I can't, you know, is that, I, I don't know what to say. 

00:12:20
DANUTA But that's what I wanted to hear from you. 

00:12:25
JEAN You want to hear from me that I can't feel with you? 

00:12:25
DANUTA You are not responsible for my feelings because for a moment I just felt like I was left out. That's all. 

00:12:35
JEAN And I and you got a response for your feeling but what about everybody else? Did everybody else really feel with you? Don't you wonder about that too? Could that be real? 

00:12:45
DANUTA I received a (inaudible ), a real feeling from Brenda, ah, I really treasure what Ron said to me- (crosstalk) 

00:12:50
JEAN Uh hmm. 

00:12:50
DANUTA - ah, I, and Ginny and Mary Anne ah, I feel, I feel like I resolved this. I, ah, I needed this confrontation. Not all of them, they were nice- (crosstalk) 

00:13:05
DR. PEG CARROLL Yeah. 

00:13:05
DANUTA - Brenda said to me, ah, things which I needed to hear. Ryan said- (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:13:10
DANUTA - that he was in himself and he didn't pay attention to me and was okay. And I hear a few beautiful women I, I treasure but I didn't hear anything from you and you were sitting down and saying, "I feel resistant." 

00:13:25
JEAN  But it was, I didn't feel any longer. It was a case of you or I. I was feeling everybody else. I was feeling disbelief. 

00:13:35
BRENDA You're saying that you're boiling over and you're, yet can almost feel it but then I don't know, I don't understand because I don't know what you're angry at of who you're angry at. 

00:13:45
GINNY Jean, can I say something too? Uhm, I don't think I feel angry but I feel maybe a level of I'm little annoyed or forced to look at myself because I said some nice things and it's like in order to exist in a group, I have to be angry and ah, I, I felt connected. I was involved. You were not involved then and maybe you're angry 'coz you weren't involved and I don't. (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
DR. PEG CARROLL I don't think, Ginny can (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:14:21
GINNY No, Okay. I'll try. And I don't, I don't wanna be blamed. Well, I guess, I want to be allowed to be me. And I'm not sure that you're doing that right now- (crosstalk) 

00:14:30
JEAN (inaudible ). 

00:14:34
GINNY - And I don't feel that way right now. I feel pushed to, to, to do something that I don't feel inclined to do. 

00:14:40
JEAN That's what exactly what I'm checking. I feel like, you know, checking with everybody. Did you really feel like that? 'Coz if I- (crosstalk) 

00:14:50
GINNY It's like you don't believe me. 

00:14:50
JEAN - I'm checking. I didn't say I didn't believe you. I did say that what I felt at the time was that I could not believe what I, what I felt was happening people(ph) saying. (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
GINNY Hey, but if, when you say that it doesn't matter how many times I tell you I felt that way because I felt I'm getting defensive 'coz I'm getting angry 'coz you didn't believe me first time so would you come back and check me, it's not gonna change the way I feel. I like it irritated that you have, you really feel that way because what I feel, excuse me, I'm not supposed to feel that way. She's telling, she's giving me a message. Ah, you give, you gave me a big message here today, ah, that I couldn't feel guilty or responsible because I have not done something that if I looked at I haven't done in relation to Danuta. I can, I, I can feel good about that but it's like I'm not supposed to be able to feel that way. 

00:15:40
JEAN But if I don't check. 

00:15:40
RON  Jean. 

00:15:45
JEAN I'm. (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
RON Excuse me. Can I, can I say something- (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
JEAN Sure. 

00:15:45
RON - 'coz I'm getting, I'm getting hot under the collar. 

00:15:45
JEAN  Uh hmm. 

00:15:50
RON You the one checking about the game and I think this checking business and all this other finding out how we feel is the game. You're being the game player. 

00:16:00
JEAN How? 

00:16:00
RON You're asking, I wanna check, I want to make sure everyone has got their feelings intact- (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
JEAN Why? 

00:16:05
RON - while you move away from the group. (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
JEAN I, I. (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
RON I don't want you away from the group. 

00:16:05
JEAN We have to trust this group equally, you and I. You have, you have to trust your feelings. If they're different than mine at any given time and I have to trust my feelings. If they're different from anyone else's at any given time, who said I couldn't check? 

00:16:20
RON But you're calling it a game and now the game- (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
JEAN  Uhm. 

00:16:25
RON - it looks as if you're playing. You're putting the game, the rules out. I'm gonna check and make sure everything is okay with the group. 

00:16:30
JEAN I. (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
RON And then if it's okay, I'll join in if it's not, then I'll stay back where the hell I was? 

00:16:35
JEAN I said it didn't safe for me right then. 

00:16:35
DR. PEG CARROLL  Does it feel safe for you know? 

00:16:40
JEAN Well, it feels a lot more real. 

00:16:40
MARY ANNE  But I, I'm weary(ph). You are making the judgment. You say I'm resistant. 

00:16:50
JEAN Are(ph) me? 

00:16:50
MARY ANNE Wait a minute though. I don't know what you're feeling. I haven't known from the beginning of the day and you're checking everybody. It's probably you're trusting. You, you still, you don't, I don't feel you trust me. From what you've said, well, I don't know if you're really feeling that or that. Or this is fake and all of a sudden it's not real. I mean, you have a problem with trust. So yes, if I didn't trust this group, I'll be resistant too. And I sure as hell wouldn't reveal now who is really feeling. But don't tell me I'm not real or you're not real or she's not real or him or her because the only one I feel, I don't know who the heck you are. I have no idea, except that you tell what everybody else who's real who's not. You don't trust. (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
JEAN But (inaudible ) If I don't trust, why can't I ask? 

00:17:35
MARY ANNE If you don't trust, why can't you ask? (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
JEAN If I all of a sudden feel like I don't trust then this group is here for all. (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
MARY ANNE So, I don't trust you- (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
JEAN (inaudible ) 

00:17:41
MARY ANNE - because I don't know who you are. So, I won't say anything about feelings anymore. That's why the (inaudible ) said it 'coz you said its fake. 

00:17:46
BRENDA  I wanna know what you feel right now? 

00:17:50
DR. PEG CARROLL You can be the leader. 

00:17:50
BRENDA Oh, I'm just, I wanna know for me. 

00:17:50
DR. PEG CARROLL Alright. What is it you wanna know. (crosstalk) 

00:17:50
BRENDA I wanna know. 

00:17:50
DR. PEG CARROLL  What are you experiencing? What's going on with you? 

00:17:55
BRENDA I'm uncomfortable. 

00:17:55
DR. PEG CARROLL  Okay. Why? 

00:18:00
BRENDA I'm uncomfortable 'coz I'm, I'm seeing things fly back and forth and, uhm, it makes me uncomfortable. I'm worried. 

00:18:05
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm, worried? Okay great(ph). 

00:18:10
BRENDA Yeah. I'm worried right now. 

00:18:10
GINNY I'm not worrying. I'm really glad that this is happening. And I think this started at a long time ago. Didn't you know when you first said to Jean. I like to hear who you are and, uhm, that went by me and now I, I'm with Mary Anne. I'd like, I know more about you now that you don't trust. Watch more now and I hear the angry feeling. Uhm, and I'm glad that, that they're out. 

00:18:40
MARY ANNE  I got to tell you something else. My heart is beating. My face is red. I am a wreck 'coz I hate it but anyway. I mean, aw. 

00:18:50
DANUTA (inaudible ) and guess what, you know, (inaudible ) when I'm, ah, on a hot seat or when I'm asked that's when my face is red. That's when my heart is beating. And the first thing I notice is, Jean, you, you're neck was red. You, you have the spots on you, ah, on the body- (crosstalk) 

00:19:10
JEAN I do that. 

00:19:10
DANUTA - and in your face and then you were sitting there and saying, "I'm resistant" and that's, it, it really bothered me and I felt this then you don't trust. I felt that, uhm, I wanted to know more about that. I wanted you to be with us. 

00:19:30
RON  We need her with us. 

00:19:35
DR. PEG CARROLL Oh, yes, yes. 

00:19:35
DANUTA Yeah, we do, yeah. 

00:19:35
RON We need her to be part of the group. 

00:19:35
Danuta Hmm. 

00:19:35
ART  Ah, I'm feeling a little bit uncomfortable with everybody except for Jean. I accepted what Jean said. (crosstalk) 

00:19:45
DR. PEG CARROLL You talk to Jean? 

00:19:50
ART Yes, I'm talking to you, Jean. I accept what you said Jean and I'm getting that feeling that I'm, I'm supposed to bait you. I know that by me saying this, now everybody is looking at me because I somehow connect with what you're saying. And I don't wanna have to bait you on this. And I feel that everyone else is baiting you. And now maybe, now everybody else will get me by that but I, I get the impression that, uhm, that, there's something Peg had said, ah, when she pointed out that I immediately, when she pointed out that you were the only one that resisted, I said, oh no, here it goes, angling at her. And I didn't have that need to do that. And, I'm just wondering if, we're all getting, you know, carried away with the issue, ah, 'coz I'm not getting, ah, carried away with this. But I, I accept the fact that she was resistant. I accept the fact that, that's real. I accept the fact that, ah, if she wanted to talk about it, she would talk about it. And by her having checked with us, I also accept that as, as a way. Now, yes maybe there was a lack of, uhm, trust, ah, on that but that's okay with me. 

00:21:05
DR. PEG CARROLL Al right. You're saying, "Jean it's okay for you to have resistance." But, by (inaudible ), Mary Anne and Ginny and Brenda and don't, don't Ron don't have those feelings. Is that what you're saying? 

00:21:15
RON No. No. I'm not asking ah, I'm not saying that- (crosstalk) 

00:21:15
DR. PEG CARROLL 'Coz they're having different feelings- (crosstalk) 

00:21:15
ART Yeah. I'm, I'm. (crosstalk) 

00:21:15
DR. PEG CARROLL - and you're saying well, I'm having trouble connecting with those. 

00:21:20
ART Yeah, I'm, I'm having a hard time trying to describe what, what's going on inside me but. (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
DR. PEG CARROLL Well, let me see if I can help you. I think that what is being commented to you Jean is, Jean it's hard for you to trust. Did I have that right? Is that you were? It's hard for me to trust right here, right? Okay. And I think that people were saying it's how you're, how you're checking it out and, and not trusting us that bothers us. 

00:21:50
JEAN Uh-huh. 

00:21:50
DR. PEG CARROLL Are you hearing that? 

00:21:50
JEAN Uh-huh. 

00:21:50
DR. PEG CARROLL  Now and, and (inaudible )- (crosstalk) 

00:21:56
ART Over here. 

00:21:56
DR. PEG CARROLL - rescuing you over here. Which do you want in the group? 

00:22:00
[sil.] 

00:22:00
MARY ANNE  You see, I really want you in the group 'coz I think you're a valuable member and I don't care if you're silent if you choose to as long as you're here but I want you to trust me and know I'm real and that the others are. I want you in the group. I don't want you sitting out here and not trusting. I feel like I can't, I'm stuck or the group is stuck without all of us trusting each other even if it's silence or orally verbal like me. 

00:22:35
DR. PEG CARROLL I think you, I think you're saying you want to be a trusting person. Do I have that right? 

00:22:40
JEAN  But, not if there's only one set of rules. 

00:22:45
DR. PEG CARROLL  Uh hmm. 

00:22:50
JEAN There's no room for it, you know, there's no room for me but, there's always for everybody. (crosstalk) 

00:22:50
DR. PEG CARROLL There's no room (inaudible ) I don't, I don't believe you. Is that what you mean, there's no room- (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
JEAN Right. 

00:22:55
DR. PEG CARROLL - that's hard or, or that's hard for me to take? 

00:22:55
JEAN  Either one of those. 

00:23:00
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:23:00
JEAN There's no room for that. 

00:23:00
DR. PEG CARROLL  I don't hear that. I hear, hear the need for you to be here and to be a trusting member of the group. 

00:23:15
[sil.] 

00:23:15
BRENDA  I really want you to be here and I want you to trust me. I don't want to save you or rescue if you don't want that- (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
JEAN That's okay. I don't need. It's alright. 

00:23:30
BRENDA But, but I really want you to be here. 

00:23:35
DR. PEG CARROLL Did you get the sense that Jean required rescuing, Brenda? 

00:23:40
BRENDA Not really. (inaudible ) No. 

00:23:45
DR. PEG CARROLL People said, "Jean I don't know you?" Do you know Jean? 

00:23:50
BRENDA  I feel something very strongly right now. 

00:24:00
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
BRENDA  I think, I know her a little bit. 

00:24:05
DR. PEG CARROLL  She's over there. 

00:24:10
BRENDA She knows. Yeah, I know you a little bit. I thought there's a little bit of connection. And I guess I want you, I want you to trust; now I want you to be a, and I don't know how to help that to happen. 

00:24:25
JEAN  Just be yourself. I liked, I like you. I like who you've been here. It's only, how may I even knew you. You could say that to everybody here. 

00:24:45
DR. PEG CARROLL  So, what you're saying is I like each of you and there's no one I have real negative feelings about? 

00:24:55
JEAN That's right. 

00:24:55
DR. PEG CARROLL But it's hard for me. Can you say that? What it is? What's. (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
JEAN  I don't know. 

00:25:05
DR. PEG CARROLL  I like you to help you to express it. 

00:25:10
JEAN Well, I just, you know, be who you are. 

00:25:15
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh-huh, but what about you? who you gonna be? 

00:25:15
JEAN Let(ph) me be who I am. 

00:25:20
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay. And that might be not so trust. (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
JEAN So great every once in a while. 

00:25:25
DR. PEG CARROLL No, Not great. That's not the term. 

00:25:25
JEAN Not so trusting. 

00:25:25
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:25:25
JEAN  Because I trust my instincts. 

00:25:30
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm, I sense you've been hurt. 

00:25:35
JEAN Well, I think that's what happens when you get mad. 

00:25:40
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm, okay. 

00:25:40
JEAN  And you can't swallow it,- (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:25:45
JEAN - you could get hurt. 

00:25:45
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay. Okay. So. (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
JEAN But I cannot ignore that I really think I feel a(ph) very hard time with that. 

00:25:50
MARY ANNE But I don't know what you feel. 

00:25:55
JEAN I felt that what was happening here was not real. It was not possible to have it feel like that because it was something about what was happening that was required. That was just me. I, you know, you, nobody know and, and may have felt. I don't know. I felt it was required to respond to both Danuta and to Ron. 

00:26:15
DR. PEG CARROLL Jean, all of those really wonderful nice feelings people had are, are hard to buy at(ph). 

00:26:20
JEAN Very hard to buy, I'm a person too. I don't feel a 100 percent for each person here all the time. Don't ask me to. Just don't ask me to and that's why I live and if, and if, if, if somehow you translated what was happening here is that or in , what kind of an authentic response or feeling am I gonna get, you know, if I need you I don't need it handed out just because it, it seems to be the right words. 

00:26:50
DANUTA Jennifer, in a short time, I really felt like you are with us. I, I, I felt you with me. I felt, felt like you join me. I mean, I felt that I can relate to you on the feelings level. And, and right now, I'm feeling for your, for your, of your back and come(ph) and I'm losing through(ph) again and, uhm, uhm, I don't know. I, I, I probably will accept that, you know. I don't want to do it but if that's where the place you wanted to be, ah, that's where you're going to be. But I don't like that. I would like you with me (inaudible ). 

00:27:42
ART Well, Danuta, I accept where she is,- (crosstalk) 

00:27:42
 Hmm. 

00:27:42
ART - right? She's saying that her feelings are not always the same as ours. They're not the same as mine. I, I, I'm accepting that. 

00:27:50
DANUTA  Well. (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
ART What I'm accepting what you're saying that you would like her to be with you. 

00:27:55
DANUTA  Yeah. Okay. 

00:28:00
ART But I'm also hearing her say she doesn't want it at all times be with you. Now I. (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
  Okay. 

00:28:10
DANUTA She didn't say that but, well, you, when you said it's okay not to give feedback to the group, to, to, to the members, uhm, I, I felt like, uhm, like, uhm, I don't have the right to, to, to give a feedback to people because you said it will be evading. And I didn't feel that way. I feel that I want to give a feedback to the group member because I care for them. I do. I, I, I, already built my trust in those people so when you say it's okay not to, uhm, and I also expect people to, to expect from your feedback. It helps me to see things which I cannot see by myself or maybe for a moment I forget about the responsibility I have to myself. 

00:29:00
MARY ANNE  I'm just thinking,- (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
 What if. (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
MARY ANNE - I think I heard you say, would it help me if back when Danuta said, no one gave her, you know, feedback if at that time if, I mean from what you've just said, I, I heard you saying I think that's when you begin to feel angry. You know, a bit, well, something was required of you that you didn't feel you have to give and then other people were kind of appalled or well, whatever apologize. At that point, I was not in that state of mind because I mean, I don't wanna go back but anyway, she was trying to rescue me at that time whatever but it would have helped me, okay, if at that time, you had expressed that rather than later on saying I'm resistant because it, it's hard to know, you know, what's your feeling and then sure you know I would get angry and angrier if I hurt so- (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:55
MARY ANNE - everybody trying to rescue but it would have helped me to have heard that. And I feel in a group, I can take the confrontive,- (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
DR. PEG CARROLL  You're here. You're here. 

00:30:05
MARY ANNE - yeah, and the, I can take the confrontive statements because it'll help me, I wanna learn how other people see me,- (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
JEAN Uh hmm. 

00:30:10
MARY ANNE - you know, not running around on my own back(ph) 'coz it'll help me, you know, become more real. You know, what I project to the outside and what's on inside it(ph), and if other people I don't want them just say nice, nice. 

00:30:20
DR. PEG CARROLL If you've been authentic way back earlier- (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
MARY ANNE Right. 

00:30:20
DR. PEG CARROLL - it would have been better. Have that right? 

00:30:25
MARY ANNE Yeah. 

00:30:25
DR. PEG CARROLL  Where is everyone else? 

00:30:30
LUCY  I'm wondering and I don't know how to put this without putting in a question form. Uhm, I've been listening to what everybody has been saying and I don't know, my level of trust is, is kind of off with you know. Uhm, I, I heard what Mary Anne was saying about why didn't you sooner speak up, uhm, and I'm just wondering if that was something that you felt and couldn't deal with or again the same question. I don't know I still feel uncomfortable and unsettled. You have a right to check out if you don't think somebody is responding but I resent that. I resent the way you did it, I think. I resent the way you just sort of hold out of the whole group and said it to the group as a whole but then we are able to go around and say but I like you more, I, I'm, I'm uhm, again this is what between the cognitive and the feeling and I'm just unsettled. 

00:31:25
ART I don't, I don't feel the same resentment to, uhm, to get that kind of feedback but, ah, in a manner which she got it. Uhm, I, I feel that we baited. I felt that somehow, ah, a little bit antagonist with toward Peg and pointing her out and somehow we were all supposed to, ah, you know, cue in on her and, ah, begin to find out what those feelings were. 

00:31:55
DR. PEG CARROLL So what you're noticing is that you saw me having a lot of control on this group. 

00:32:00
ART Yes. And I and I thought- (crosstalk) 

00:32:00
DR. PEG CARROLL And you're uncomfortable with that? 

00:32:00
ART No. 

00:32:00
DR. PEG CARROLL You were uncomfortable with that. (crosstalk) 

00:32:05
ART No, I was not comfortable with that- (crosstalk) 

00:32:05
DR. PEG CARROLL Right. 

00:32:05
ART - at that particular time- (crosstalk) 

00:32:05
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm, okay. (crosstalk) 

00:32:05
ART - because I got the impression that we're all beginning to take the- (crosstalk) 

00:32:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:32:10
ART - the, the kind of control within the group and- (crosstalk) 

00:32:10
DR. PEG CARROLL But you, what you're also saying is I didn't do anything about it. (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
ART I didn't do anything about it, right. 

00:32:15
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:32:15
ART And I didn't know what was going on at that time. 

00:32:15
DR. PEG CARROLL  How, how do you feel about that not having done anything about it? 

00:32:20
ART Uhm, powerless. 

00:32:25
DR. PEG CARROLL But you said you're, you've felt powerless and that I have a lot of control over you? 

00:32:30
ART Yes. 

00:32:30
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay. Go ahead with what you're saying. 

00:32:30
ART  I feel good for having said it though. 

00:32:35
DR. PEG CARROLL Good. Good. 

00:32:35
ART Well, as much I respect you and admire you,- (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
DR. PEG CARROLL It's okay. 

00:32:35
ART I still felt it's a little bit- (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
DR. PEG CARROLL Glad you can, glad you can say. 

00:32:35
ART (inaudible ) 

00:32:40
MARY ANNE I mean, I felt I did hear Jean say or I feel resisted and I just felt if, if anybody, I mean, if the person feels resisted, you know, if you don't find out why , then you're not going to control the group it's gonna get stuck. 

00:33:00
DR. PEG CARROLL Well, we're gonna stop but we're going to get back again. But I'm watching your time and then it's something that, that, uhm, way back earlier, I had said that there are issues that have to be resolved before the group can be a group. Now, that issue is related to authority. That is a very important concept as far as I am concerned, in why you're a group. We have gone through maybe six sessions and what happened' What do we learn' What did you learn outside about authority had not been resolved. Where did you finds, find it? Where was it? Not resolved. 

00:33:40
 (inaudible ). 

00:33:41
DR. PEG CARROLL Yeah. Who, who brought it up? 

00:33:45
 Oh, (inaudible ). 

00:33:46
DR. PEG CARROLL All right, right. That's right. Just now, now, until we are sure of every person, there's a lot of residue that is never dealt with and that has to be resolved and what did I have to say when I said try to consider, what did he say? 

00:33:55
  You felt better. 

00:34:00
DR. PEG CARROLL Felt better because he did it and so now, he is going to move on and become a different member of the group. Now, the thing, the thing as you're leading a group is this, that you must have the patience. Frankly, I was not really aware of that and the minute I heard it, I said, "Oh, oh, this was part of the resistant process." This is part of the process again without doing anything. Now, that's where I'm coming from and that each and every person has to resolve this, uhm, and so therefore as I say, the group is gonna be different from now on, now, comments or questions? 

00:34:30
LUCY Now, I felt there were, that there where two issues from the beginning that was still being (inaudible ). The whole thing of trust- (crosstalk) 

00:34:37
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:34:37
LUCY - started at the beginning supposedly was resolved and then now it became a big(ph) that she brought it out again. 

00:34:40
DR. PEG CARROLL Well, that. (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
LUCY - the same thing with the authority authority just like the two issues that we started with- (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
DR. PEG CARROLL That's right. 

00:34:45
LUCY - were with again. 

00:34:45
DR. PEG CARROLL All right. Trust is really resolved early. You have to see it. The only way that you, people cannot say I trust you. You have to see it happening in order to believe it. Yeah. 

00:35:00
EILEEN MATTHAY Also with Brenda. It seems as if there were several opportunities to work on her anger or her, her, difficulty- (crosstalk) 

00:35:05
DR. PEG CARROLL  Uh hmm. 

00:35:10
EILEEN MATTHAY - in dealing and expressing- (crosstalk) 

00:35:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Hmm. 

00:35:10
EILEEN MATTHAY - her anger and that I wonder if, did you choose to not do more with that (inaudible )? 

00:35:18
DR. PEG CARROLL 'Coz I don't think the group is gonna help her and see I can't do it alone. If I have, I can stop something but I have to know who is going to help her, I don't even know who is gonna her. 

00:35:25
GAIL MORRIS It seems to me that you like you have a wide range of feeling vocabulary and even if you take one feeling like anger that you're able to really water it down for group members that have trouble dealing with that and what do I do to add on to that? 

00:35:40
DR. PEG CARROLL Change the words meaning 

00:35:40
GAIL MORRIS Change the words- (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
DR. PEG CARROLL Listen to him. 

00:35:40
GAIL MORRIS - depending on how much of that feeling- (crosstalk) 

00:35:45
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:35:45
GAIL MORRIS - you think the person's ready to feel by this act? 

00:35:45
DR. PEG CARROLL Yeah, that's important. 

00:35:45
GAIL MORRIS Are you doing that? 

00:35:45
DR. PEG CARROLL Yes, that's important. Do you think it was an easy group to work with. 

00:35:50
HELEN SGOUROS No. In fact, I have a question, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
DR. PEG CARROLL Yeah. 

00:35:55
HELEN SGOUROS What were some of the things that you did do? Ah, there was so much going on- (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
DR. PEG CARROLL You didn't see them? 

00:36:00
HELEN SGOUROS - that I was wondering, yeah, I, I really got lost in the intensity of the feeling and I was wondering why you let the group, the group go on for a while as long as you did. 

00:36:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:36:10
HELEN SGOUROS And why you intervened at some times, what, what? 

00:36:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Right. Why did I let it go on for so long? Anyone have (inaudible ) why I let it go on for so long? 

00:36:15
PATRICK MURPHY Well, I was thinking at one of your calls, you said earlier on the day was authentic relationships- (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
DR. PEG CARROLL Hmm, uh hmm. 

00:36:20
PATRICK MURPHY - and to this people who were struggling with doing that, you gave them the space to do that- (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
DR. PEG CARROLL That's right. 

00:36:25
PATRICK MURPHY - and when. (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
DR. PEG CARROLL I gave them the space to interact with each other. (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
PATRICK MURPHY And when it didn't happen, you made interventions. 

00:36:25
DR. PEG CARROLL  Right. 

00:36:30
EILEEN MATTHAY At one point, Mary Anne was almost diagnosing, uhm, Jean, saying that you have a problem. Listen, your problem, you have a problem with trust- (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm, hmm, I let it go on. 

00:36:40
EILEEN MATTHAY - and you, because if you would intervene, it seemed, I think, it would have ruined it. (crosstalk) 

00:36:40
DR. PEG CARROLL Well, I would have stop Mary Anne as a member. 

00:36:45
EILEEN MATTHAY Yeah. Yeah. 

00:36:45
DR. PEG CARROLL And I felt that she was not going to be hurtful on how she said it and I felt Jean could hear it. When I was going to come back with the two and say it in a different way and, ah, I felt I thought that was all right because that's like saying I don't like your behavior. I don't like what you're doing then that's okay. She wasn't labeling her. She wasn't diagnosing her. When I did stop, well, and he said I think you and I are blocking on the same things and then there's no way to know what that means. That's the kind of thing you want to stop. Anita? 

00:37:10
ANITA HIRANANDANI It's the question earlier when the group was lking about, uhm, trust and Jean's issue of authority, I also felt there was an issue of, uhm, that it's hard to receive good feelings- (crosstalk) 

00:37:20
DR. PEG CARROLL Hmm, hmm. It hurt,- (crosstalk) 

00:37:20
ANITA HIRANANDANI - which really hurt (inaudible ). 

00:37:23
DR. PEG CARROLL - true, yeah- (crosstalk) 

00:37:23
ANITA HIRANANDANI Yeah, uh hmm. 

00:37:23
DR. PEG CARROLL - but you see the, I've felt so many things that had I said them, the group was not going to respond to them- (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
ANITA HIRANANDANI Uh hmm. 

00:37:25
DR. PEG CARROLL - some people worked, had worked very hard at, ah, at (inaudible ) and said a lot. She wasn't gonna say anymore. I knew she wasn't. You knew, had, you know what certain people are going to do. 

00:37:35
ANITA HIRANANDANI Uh hmm. 

00:37:35
DR. PEG CARROLL But I also knew there were a lot of things that people have not dealt with here. Because you've spent, spent so much time with Jean so this is a group that I bet you're going on for ten more weeks because many people have issues that they want to, want to deal with. Yeah. 

00:37:50
 I was observing that they would, that interaction between you and Jean when she and, and it wasn't just you obviously, it was the whole group, she was I thought emotional, all the tears. (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
DR. PEG CARROLL Oh, oh, she was. Her eyes were all watery. 

00:38:00
 Yes. 

00:38:00
DR. PEG CARROLL Yes. 

00:38:00
 And, and, uhm, you were praising, maybe the most (inaudible ) sometimes we trust- (crosstalk) 

00:38:06
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh. 

00:38:06
 - anyone- (crosstalk) 

00:38:06
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:38:06
 - something from the group wanting something for yourself and then you stop. I mean, you no longer, it was, and, and maybe it was then for the group and, and maybe it was meant for the group, and, and maybe that's my question. You, you didn't push her. You didn't go (inaudible )- (crosstalk) 

00:38:19
DR. PEG CARROLL  Hmm, hmm. 

00:38:20
