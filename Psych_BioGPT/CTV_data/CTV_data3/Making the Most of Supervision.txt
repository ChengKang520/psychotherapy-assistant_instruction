making the most of supervision 

00:00:05
a programme from counselling DVDs in association with University of Wales Newport Prilysgol Cyrsu Casmwyndt 

00:00:05
with Lesley Spencer & Els van Ooijen 

00:01:00
MIKE SIMMONS Hello, my name is Mike Simmons. Supervision is an essential part of a counselor's working life. Not simply because it's a requirement of the British Association of Counseling and Psychotherapy, but because it's acknowledged to be a key component of effective practice. Without it, it's impossible for a counselor to ensure that they're working safely or in the best interest of their clients. This program is about supervision. And I'm joined in the studio today by Lesley Spencer and Els van Ooijen, both of whom have very many years' experience with working both as a counselor and as a supervisor. Lesley and Els developed a post-graduate supervision program which has been running at the University of Wales Newport since the late 80s. This provides essential training for those supervising counselors, therapists, and other helping professionals. Els teaches on that program, and has also written a number of well received books, including Clinical Supervision, A Practical Guide, and Clinical Supervision Made Easy. The Three Step Method. Both of these have been welcomed by practicing supervisors offering, as they do, a clear insight into the process of supervision. The purpose of this program, however, is not to explore how to be a supervisor. That will be the subject of another program. What we're looking at today is simply how to use supervision. Something that I know bothers very many trainee counselors. Some of whom harbor a range of fantasies about what supervision is actually like. So let's start to dispel some of those fantasies. Els, what is supervision? 

00:02:50
ELS VAN OOIJEN Supervision is, first of all, is um, support for the, for the counselor or therapist. A place where they can talk about the work, uh, the impact it has on them, and to reflect on what it is they're doing. So it, first of all, it's support, it's also as a means of, uh, a certain amount of quality control, if you like, to make sure that what they're doing is good and ethical. And it's also a means to, um, to really learn through reflection, with a more experienced, usually a more experienced practitioner. But also, it's not to be underestimated, the effect it has on, on us, you know, the counselors and therapists. And if we have no-where, where we can off-load, where we can reflect with someone else on what's happening, to make sure that, uh, we don't overlook things or get caught up in certain processes. Um, we probably wouldn't work as effectively, and it would also, it could possibly have a negative effect on us, if we had no-where to take it. 

00:03:55
MIKE SIMMONS And Lesley, I think I've heard you talking about, kind of, an overview supervision kind of above someone outside the client-counselor relationship, still seeing the work going on. 

00:04:10
LESLEY SPENCER Yes, I think one of the things about supervision is that, um, if you don't go to supervision it's bit like, it's a bit of a vacuum just between you and the client all the time. And it's, you know, like you get too close to your work a bit like you can't see the wood for the trees. So, that process of going to a supervisor, uh, allows you to sort of um, through the, the supervisors asking questions and helping you to reflect, it allows you to have a different perspective, to take an overview to see things in a new light to get new ideas. And it very much helps with that, um, restorative type function, so the support that Els was talking about, it sort of, um, it actually is a safe place for in a sense, um, a counselor to, maybe sometimes, let off a bit of steam, or say, oh this person was really irritating me, I found that really difficult. And for them still to feel held in that process, because um, it's somewhere in which you know, a good supervision process, you can be open and you can be held in that way. 

00:05:15
MIKE SIMMONS I think certainly, from talking to students, uh, there's a kind of sense that a supervisor is rather like a supervisor in a factory. Maintaining an eye on the quality of work, which sure, the type of supervisor we're talking about will do, but nothing else. So it's almost a, a fearsome figure with a clipboard. Uh, the reality is, a supervisor is someone I should be able to say, I really screwed up, we got, I got it wrong, in some way. Uh, And for that to be explored, rather to be kind of subject to some kind of penalty. 

00:05:55
ELS VAN OOIJEN Absolutely, I like, I like the term supervision to be broken down into super and vision, so that's not somebody who's overseeing what you're doing, and knocks you over the head if you're not doing well. But to give you, the, the, the therapist, a different way a different vision, uh, and expand it, super-vision, if you like, through and a deeper vision as to what might be going on between you and the client. 

00:06:15
MIKE SIMMONS Now no, in different countries, there are different views about supervision and indeed how much supervision someone requires. In the U.K., what's the general- 

00:06:25
LESLEY SPENCER I think there's an expectation that actually, um, you should have ongoing supervision, um, so obviously, for a trainee it's terribly important and I'm aware, in America, trainees tend to be in supervision, but once you qualify, uh, there's less emphasis on that. Whereas in this country, we tend to think, um, that ongoing opportunity to reflect on your work, and to need to talk to somebody else about it is sort of something that makes sure that we don't, kind of like, fall into sloppy habits, or um, you know lose touch. I mean having to actively think about how ethics applies to our work on a regular basis. But I think what, quite often tends to happen with very experienced counselors is that they work out their supervisory relationships with, they talk to other more experienced counselors, but still the same process applies, it's about sitting down and thinking about your work, reflecting on what you're doing with clients, looking at themes that might be following through it with all of your clients which have to do with yourself and your own life history. Uh, we've all got kind of like little sensitive points in our life history, which if we're not mindful of them we're not aware of them, that we might find that we get stuck into helping in a way that's less helpful, uh, and I think part of that supervising process is actually getting us to, to really know ourselves, and to work in a way that's most constructive for our clients. 

00:07:55
MIKE SIMMONS I was just thinking when I used to interview people who wanted to come onto the counseling program, uh, enormous number of people had a kind of helper script. I want to be a counselor, because I want to help people. Now we can see that as being very laudable, the other side of that coin is, that if someone hasn't got someone on their side, and they've got that kind of script, they'll help and help and help and not look at the impact on themselves. Yes, one of the things a supervisor is doing is helping with self-care. 

00:08:30
ELS VAN OOIJEN Absolutely, and I, and I think, that's why, um, having a good relationship with a supervisor is so important, whether it's, uh, through, uh, being in, still being in training and being, having a supervisor allocate it or peer supervision. The important thing is that they really get to know you and you get to know each other so that, uh, a good peer supervisor, for example, if you've ever experienced, might say ah, there you go again, did you know when you were working with so and so something similar happened, you remember? You know so that, and that would feel totally safe. And collaborative. Yeah. 

00:09:05
MIKE SIMMONS I guess the other thing I'm aware of is that most of us start our practice in life in an agency of some sort. Certainly something that most courses would encourage. Uh, and the moment we start thinking about an agency, I'm aware that there is a, a strain of management, and strain of supervision to be aware of. The manager is going to be aware of the way in which the agency itself functions. Supervisor is going to be aware of the work that happens within that agency. And they are very different roles, and need to be kept separate. 

00:09:40
LESLEY SPENCER Yes, I mean I totally agree, and I think that's one of the things that um, we very often talk to people when they're applying for the course, supervision course that we run is that we need to make it quite clear to them that actually what we train people in is non-managerial supervision, and the distinction is to my mind is that as a manager, you are responsible for your employee's work and you're responsible to the organization in terms, in making sure that targets are met, and the overall client group, uh, are is, is being serviced in that sort of way. And that tends to mean that, you know, when uh, an employee comes and talks to a manager, they are concerned about them, they are supportive, but they can't take their eye off that kind of normative type function, that managerial function. And I think the difference is, is with, um, supervision sometimes called clinical supervision or consultative supervision, um, or reflective supervision, is that, um, the supervisee comes along, uh, to reflect on their work with clients so there could be some similarities with that, but the supervisors job is primarily to look after the welfare of the clients, but also to look after the supervisee. Uh, and to make sure that, um, they're supported, that their developmental needs are being looked at, and um, you know, if they need continued professional development courses and things like that, that's encouraged. Um, but also that they're practicing ethically. And that I, I think one of the problems with a managerial supervisor as opposed to a clinical supervisor is that in some ways that fact, that they're involved with hire and fire, sometimes would be restrict what, uh, a supervisee might say to them, because they would be anxious of, if I admit that I've done this wrong or I've done that wrong, is that going to put a black mark against me or go down badly with my appraisal. Whereas a clinical supervisor still, um, holds responsibility for maintaining the standards of the profession, and ultimately, the client's welfare is the most important thing. But it's also kind of recognized that actually, that there needs to be a relationship of trust where, um, people feel okay to look at their practice in an honest and unapologetic way, really. Uh, and to examine the things that go well, and the difficulties. And if they can do that then they much more likely to be open so that the two roles are really, have a distinction in that way. 

00:12:25
MIKE SIMMONS Right, yeah, I know very conscious, someone who I can say, I really got that wrong, and to hear the response, well that's interesting, I wonder what that's about. Rather than feeling that black mark. You're talking about as being kind of marked against my name. Um, so, what kind of supervision would a trainee counselor, a novice counselor tend to need? 

00:12:50
ELS VAN OOIJEN I think a novice counselor will need more intensive supervision than somebody who's been working for many years. Um, the BASP stipulates a minimum of an hour and a half a month, but really for, a trainee, I'd say say that they need a lot more than that. Uh, ideally once every, extra at the beginning, but once every, every few sessions, some courses indeed, will uh, provide supervision after every session that a, that a trainee has had. but it's very important that they have the kind of supervision that is congruent with the training they're doing, because there are many, very many different ways in which we can counsel, or in which therapy can be practiced as person-centered, as psychodynamic, Gestalt or as existential, there's integrative, there's CBT, and it would be very confusing for a trainee, if they were saying, being trained in a person-centered approach and then had CBT supervision, that just wouldn't work. So it's very important that they have supervision from a supervisor who's completely, uh, well-versed and works in this same modality so that they can really learn all about how to work within that modality. 

00:14:05
MIKE SIMMONS And which would you say is the converse, later on in their career, it might be quite stimulating or useful to have a supervisor who works from a different modality? They're complimentary. 

00:14:15
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yes, I do, in fact I find that the more experienced people get, uh, the more they like to integrate little bits from, from other approaches, um, into the way they work, because it just fleshes it out more. They go to conferences, they heard, they read books, they find out about things, and uh, increasingly I think as people get more experienced, they might seek out a supervisor who has more to offer than the modality that they're already familiar with. 

00:14:50
MIKE SIMMONS I think we might also be worth saying that generally speaking, someone's career as a counselor, if they stick with the same supervisor for the length of that career, they're doing their selves and their clients a bit of a disservice. 

00:15:05
LESLEY SPENCER Yes, I, I think it's one of those things that, it's very easy to um, stick to one's comfort zone, and get comfortable and a bit too cozy with the supervisor that you've had for some time. Uh, and because all of us slip into bad habits, or you know, it's shorthand, I know what you're going to respond to, so you know, I think, um, it's probably healthy to change your supervisor every three to five years, um, and I think that can be a difficult process because of course it's always hard starting with somebody new. And it makes us feel vulnerable again, um, and it's also properly true to say that not all supervisors are going to suit us. So, you know, it is a process of finding a good match with somebody both in terms of, uh, modality, the theoretic approaches they use, but with somebody who kind of like, gets us as a personality and we get them. Um, it does need to involve some challenge, so it's a kind of like a healthy balance of support and challenge. And it's properly true to say that in trainee students, uh, early days, they probably need a very high level of support, um, and quite a lot of reassurance, it's not that challenge isn't there at all, but as time goes on, um, and people become more confident in their practice, they can usually uh, benefit from and enjoy a high level of challenge. 

00:16:35
MIKE SIMMONS Listening to, a moment ago, you spoke about the vulnerability of going to a new supervisor. And I guess the other thing is, that reminds us as a vulnerability to who's just gone, of someone who's just gone to see a counselor. For the first time. Cause we might be in therapy, but that first time meeting a person is a challenge. 

00:17:00
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, I think even, even though, ideally, it's a level relationship, because it's, it's a human relationship, and the same way that between client and counselor, client and therapist, we try to be equal. In reality, of course, there is a imbalance, and it's the same with supervisor-supervisee. Uh, personally, I like that to be on the level, but it isn't, and you know there's a tension there. 

00:17:25
MIKE SIMMONS There's always stuff under there. 

00:17:25
ELS VAN OOIJEN There's always stuff, always stuff underlying it. 

00:17:30
MIKE SIMMONS Lesley, uh, minute ago you just started talking about the business of, of choosing a supervisor. Now conscious for most people starting a career, they probably don't choose a supervisor, they go to an agency, and maybe it's a small agency, there's one supervisor. Uh, but at some point in their career, then they are going to start looking for a supervisor. I wonder if it's worth to start to look at what someone might look for, when they're actually going to choose a supervisor. 

00:18:05
LESLEY SPENCER Well, um, I think there are a number of different things, I think it's a very important relationship, so I think it's definitely worth, um, putting in the effort to get it right. Now, as you said, early in one's career, very often you get allocated a supervisor at an agency, um, and, you know that can be a wonderful experience, it's a very important experience. Um, but it can also be a bit hit and miss as we know from our experience of training supervisors that when they reflect on their history, very often they find, um, they've had some excellent experiences, and they've also had some experiences which perhaps have been a bit less satisfactory, and that's useful learning to have. But, but one of the things that we always say to student counselors are when they are in a position to actually choose a supervisor, is to take the time to meet the supervisor and have an honest discussion with them about how the supervisor works. It's, it's like starting any kind of relationship. So it's probably worth the student, before they go, spending a bit of time reading around supervision and thinking about it, and perhaps writing down a list of areas that um, perhaps questions they want to ask or things that they know that they need. It could be things like, you know is it the same theoretical approach as the one that I'm being trained on, it could be things like um, you know, would they be willing to listen to tapes of my practice with me and give me feedback. Uh, it could be things like, um, do I immediately engage with this person, do I feel that this person is listening to me, uh, do I feel that they want to find out about me and what I want, um, am I putting them on a pedestal so much that actually I'm a bit scared of saying certain things to them. Um, do I feel that they've got something offer me. Is there a sense that when I'm with the person I'm going to learn a lot from them? I'm excited by this? So, you know, what's start of supervision do they offer, all those sorts of things, so you're kind of um, I would encourage sort of somebody to, to start off with a phone call, and just make that an exploratory phone call, and ask various questions and then perhaps meet up. Um, I would say don't just go, yes, yes let's do that, I would sort of have a trial session and, lots of supervisors are quite happy if you just come along and meet and see how we work together does this feel like this is going to fit? So obviously the more homework you've done about thinking about what you want the better that is. 

00:20:45
MIKE SIMMONS Well you, you're saying homework but what I'm hearing is research, and I'm thinking about if I want to buy any washing machine, I'll actually do a fair bit of reading about what's the best washing machine. Uh, and this is a rather more important thing than buying a washing machine. 

00:21:00
LESLEY SPENCER It is, and I think, the trouble is it's one of those things that's, it's very often, not until you've had an experience of supervision, um, that you get clear about what it is, and what it is that you want and what it is that you don't' want. So, that you know to some extent, probably um, for a trainee counselor's first experience, see it's a bit like, well I've, just got to suck it and see and feel what it's like. But over time, as the trainee gains in confidence they will come clear about the supervision process, what they like, and what they need, because really in this relationship, if the supervisor uh, can help you think about your areas of strength, uh, and building on those, but also thinking about the areas that you need more training, you need to read more, you need more practice, and that you know, it's okay with this particular supervisor, if you can feel okay to be a bit vulnerable with them, and not just feel judged or small or put down, then, you know, it's likely going to be a growth or relationship. 

00:22:00
ELS VAN OOIJEN It's very personal. It's very personal isn't it, because one supervisor may be recommended to you, and you think oh I'll go and see them, and for whatever reason you just don't click. So sometimes it's a good idea to have a couple of conversations with a number of different supervisors and just to see, if a few fits, and of course the same goes for the supervisor. 

00:22:20
MIKE SIMMONS And you might say that if the supervisor wasn't willing to engage in that, maybe they're not the supervisor that you want anyway. So, so something about a good fit, and what about qualifications? What sort of things should I expect of someone I'm going to see as a supervisor? 

00:22:40
ELS VAN OOIJEN Well, I, I personally think that at least, obviously, have a qualification in, in therapy or counseling, and a certain amount of experience. Now, it, it used to be the case that it was very hard to find people who also had to qualification in supervision, who had done a, a supervision course. That is no longer the case, there are plenty of supervision courses at around now, so I do think it's a good idea to look for someone who had, who has some sort of qualification, who's done some sort of training. Uh, in supervision. Um, and of course talk to other people, talk to colleagues, who is good? Who is around? You know? 

00:23:20
MIKE SIMMONS Like I said, just takes us towards and they should be experienced. You don't want them to be just a jump ahead of you. 

00:23:30
ELS VAN OOIJEN Well, I feel ideally it should be somebody who's experienced, who can hold you, who is not going to be phased by anything that you might bring. Because that does sometimes happen when people first start out the, to be supervisors. You can't have come across absolutely every situation that there is. Um, so supervisors need to be open to say, well actually, um, maybe I'm not the best person for you, maybe you need to see someone else. 

00:24:00
MIKE SIMMONS You did a couple of role-plays this morning, which are gonna be part of this program. Um, one of those was a first session, uh, and I guess there are similarities there between that role-play and everyone's first session for the supervisor, even though that particular role-play was a novice counselor seeing their very first supervisor. What are the kind of things that are gonna come up in a first session? 

00:24:25
LESLEY SPENCER Well, I, I think obviously, um, you know, as you say, it's different between a, a first session for a trainee, and an experienced counselor. The more experienced you become, the clearer you get of what it is that you're looking for. And obviously therapists work in all sorts of situations, you know, private practice, increasingly they're working in schools or the health service, or EEP schemes, things like that. So, um, you're not only looking at the, the theoretical approach that the supervisor standardly works in, and whether they've got a supervision qualification and if they use supervision models, which uh, you know we would recommend that they do. You're also thinking about what their professional background is. What their experience has been. Um, you know if you're working, uh, in schools, then you're going to be looking for um, a supervisor that has experience of working with children and young people, and say, for instance, if particularly experienced in child protection issues, you know, so you're needing to think about what is my professional role, what is it I'm doing, and does the person who I'm going to for supervision, do they have that expertise to offer me, that will mean that I'm held, and, and also can, um, develop through that process of working with them. 

00:25:45
ELS VAN OOIJEN So basically it's really important to, to check, check each other out, isn't it? As the supervisee, to check out the supervisor. And the context in which you work, and does this fit. 

00:26:00
MIKE SIMMONS Els, Lesley just referred to supervision models, uh, can you expand on that a little bit? 

00:26:05
ELS VAN OOIJEN Uh, yes, I, I think it's quite, it is important uh, for supervisors to have a framework, or a model in which to work. Because without such a framework, it's very easy for the supervision not, not to go anywhere. I, I like to compare to, you were saying buying a washing machine, for example, um, I like to use the shopping analogy. If I go to the supermarket, and I haven't thought about what-, what I, what I need. Uh, and I just go to the supermarket and buy a load of stuff and I come home and I find out that I've got three cauliflowers and I've forgotten the tissues and the toilet paper, etcetera. So I think that there needs to be, there needs to be a, a framework, uh, that gives us um, something solid that we can use, where in the process, within the, within which the process can be held. Now there's a, there's a number of different models, there are models that I, um, therapy or counseling approach specific. So if you're a psycho-dynamic counselor, and you might want the psychodynamic supervisor who will work in a psychodynamic way, very similar to how they might work with a client, for example. Um, also, if you're a CBT person, a CBT supervisor might work in a much more, in, in a way that is similar to a CBT uh, client approach. Um, so that, that's one way, but increasingly there are supervision-specific models, so supervision is seen as an activity in its, in its own right. And there are models that give structure, they say first you do that, and then you do that, and then you do that, yeah? Basically, I think it's important to know how you start, unless you must referring to, in the session we did together, that maybe at the beginning you, you, uh, you say hello to each other, how are you, and then what do you want to talk about today, and you set a little bit of an agenda. Yeah? So you have a little bit of structure. But also there needs to be, managed, a process. So yeah, the whole process of reflection can be held within that structure. So if you have the kind of structure uh, like, uh, um, for instance, the cyclical model by Pagen Roscuts (ph), or the three-step model which I developed myself, that there is basically something that you do in the beginning, then you move on and there's a big reflection bit in the middle. And then you go on, okay, where are we now and how will, how will we, how will we take this, and this also means that as the supervisee, you get to, you get to know how it works. You know what's the most efficient way in which to make use of your supervision session. So you come prepared, okay, I need to talk about exes, I want to talk about Mary, and I knew why, I had some idea why you want to talk about Mary. We didn't get into that, but Mary was very depressed and I was worried about her, and I was thinking I was missing something, for example. So that the supervisee comes, okay, I know why I want to come, I know which client I want to talk about, and I actually know, roughly, what's I might want to gain from this session. So that's how you start, and that of course then gives a huge space to, to really reflect on what's going on. 

00:29:30
LESLEY SPENCER And then of course there's always, um, models that look at the process that's going on between the client and the counselor and how that might parallel what's going on between the counselor and the supervisor. 

00:29:40
ELS VAN OOIJEN Mm, absolutely, in fact, uh, the process is the most important part of the supervision. You need a structure, but then the actual process of supervision, uh, is the largest part, or should be the largest part of any supervision session. So there's a very useful, um, uh model called the uh, Seven-ite (ph) model, which are provided by Hawkins are now quite, quite a while ago, which identifies lots of different, different eyes, different lenses through which we can look at, at the work that a, a supervisee, a counselor is doing with a client. So lots of different ways in which it can, it can be done. So for example when people I knew to counseling trainees, they inevitably just want to talk about the clients. This happened to the client, and that happened to the client, and then, basically, sometimes, at the beginning, they just need to I think, at that stage, to really reiterate almost everything that, that the client has said to them. Uh, but, which doesn't leave much space, but initially, in order to be able to actually cope with hearing so much and holding so much, they need to do that. But then, quite soon, they-, they then focus on what did I do? Okay, the client said X, Y and Zed, and then I did so and so, and that's another way in which to look at it. Okay, what did you do? But then as people get more experienced, uh, they start to look at a relationship, what's happening between and the client. Uh, what's-, what's, as Lesley was saying, in the session we had, what about the client's transference, what happened, what happens between you. And then, of course, it goes even further. What happens in this session between the supervisor and the supervisee. Very interestingly, quite often, there can be a parallel. A parallel process between how the the supervisee is talking and behaving, and what's actually happening out there in their work with the client. So for example that happened when Lesley said, I'm getting a sense of, um, a sort of dragging down, and the way you're talking, and you know, and this was clearly different to how I normally talk. So I be-, she helped me to become aware that as the supervisee, I had somehow taken on something from the client, that I had not yet reflected on. And I was paralleling it in the session. And Lesley was feeling it. And that's the really rich area of reflection, all these different ways in which we use ourselves as instruments to pick up what's going on, and then reflect on that and see what it means. 

00:32:25
MIKE SIMMONS So all those different relationships, awarenesses and so forth, all informing our understanding of what's happening for the client. For the counselor, that relationship, the client, the counselor, the supervisor, and so on. 

00:32:35
ELS VAN OOIJEN It's very complex, and of course it's not just what you think, it's also what, what we sense, our intuition, what we feel in our bodies, because that was felt like what the, the one that Lesley did earlier, felt very much like a like a physical sensation of, of being dragged down. So we used all of ourselves, both in counseling, but also in supervision. It's really rich. 

00:33:00
MIKE SIMMONS So, earlier on, at the start of this discussion, I asked you what supervision was, and it was a number of things, and then as we start to talk about the process model, we can get a sense of, how it achieves those things. How it supports, how it informs, and so on. 

00:33:15
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yes, because actually, that, that example of that parallel process of, of Lesley helping me as the supervisee, to see a link between what had just happened in my, in that role-play's personal life, and what was happening with me and the client, and my reaction to the client.. Was very, felt very very supportive. It felt, it felt, it was interesting, it was a role-play, uh, but at the same time I really physically felt lighter. Ah, yes, it has been reflected upon, it has a place, I've made sense of what's happened. 

00:33:50
MIKE SIMMONS Just thinking about that, Lesley, we're talking about the session, the full session which we kind of imagine as took place about nine months after someone had been in practice. What was interesting about that watching it was the Els, the counselor, came into the room and immediately wanted to start talking about her client. And you very quickly picked up that there were other issues that, in the moment, were much more important to address, and that's what you worked with. 

00:34:20
LESLEY SPENCER Yes, I mean um, I suppose if, if I'm honest, I was slightly alarmed that she was gettin' it all straight in like that. But I could also see because I think her opening statement was, oh it's been, you know it was all the body language, she was heavy, and then you know, she was sort of expressing being a difficult week, but then she went straight into the client. I, and also, you know, I felt it was important because it is about a relationship. You know it is about the business of addressing my relationship with Els, and finding out how she is. I talked about that in, in the role play, finding out how she is, and finding out what's going on with her. Uh, and you know, maybe 90 percent of the time there is nothing particularly going on, it's an average kind of session, but sometimes it is, and it just turned out in that session there were lots of parallels, there was lots of parallel process going on. Um, and I think it, you know that was an illustration of why supervision is just so important. Because I think if we, you know, we can't always make those things up for ourselves. The, you know, I'm doing this here, and this is happening here. It, you know, you begin to understand those things more, the more experienced you are you begin to know your own history, your own material and see when those things are getting activated. But I think for people earlier on in their careers, they're not necessarily seeing, and that's just illustrates just why supervision is so important. 

00:35:45
MIKE SIMMONS So what's coming up for me is that we might talk about a client and a counselor in a room on their own, we have that awareness of confidentiality and so on, but they are by no means in a bubble that the outside world doesn't impact. The outside world is impacting on the client, and it's impacting on the therapist, in a whole range of ways, and one of the things a supervisor's going to be doing is help the counselor untangle where the outside world is impacting on them in a way that they're maybe not aware of at all. 

00:36:20
LESLEY SPENCER Yes, and I think for me that links back to, cause Els was talking earlier about Hawkins' and Joey's seven-eye modal, and there's that seventh eye, when she's kind of like, that, that wide outside world it's, um, it could be things that are going on so, you know, for the client, they were wider issues, so it's to do with, um, the marriage breakdown, finding out there was an affair. There were issues also in terms of counter-transference for Els' supervisee, um, redundancy, so it's actually looking at how the, the outside world is impacting on what's going on in there as well. 

00:36:50
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, if I can just take you back a little bit. Uh, I think it was something else said earlier on. Getting rid of the sense about how a counselor might prepare for supervision, I have an appointment at three o'clock on Tuesday afternoon. What am I going to be doing before that? What do I need to do before that? 

00:37:15
ELS VAN OOIJEN I personally think it's, it's good for, um, it's good to bear the supervision in mind all the time so that when you, when you've had a session and you think gosh that was really difficult, it would be good to reflect on that in supervision. To make a note of that. And I think Leslie was explaining that to me as the supervisee in the first session we had. So that's good. But also, to give yourself a little bit of time before a supervision session, maybe the day before, or if it's in the afternoon, in the morning, to basically just think and not even looking at your notes initially well who comes to the fore? Which client is somehow floating to the surface and wants to be talked about? So make a note of that and why. And then perhaps go through your notes of the last three sessions since you had supervision and see what, see what strikes you. And then, and then maybe make a bit of a list as to who you want to talk about, because sometimes people talk about just one client in a session, particularly if it's an hour and a half. You may want to talk about three clients. So that you come prepared. And so that you know who you need to talk about, why, you know, why you want to talk about. It could be something that you're just not clear on, there's something I'm missing I don't' know what it is, or it may be well, I, did X Y and Zed, and I'm not quite sure about that. You know something fairly, uh, specific. And then to say when you come to supervision, very experienced supervisees tend to do that, they say okay, I uh, after the meeting and the greeting and saying how are you, they'll say okay, today I'd like to talk about three clients. I'd like to talk about so and so, so and so, and so and so. I think I'll probably need most of the time on, on X, but uh, maybe also 10 or 15 minutes on the other two, yeah. So they know how they want to use the whole session, and that's really useful, because then they get what they need. 

00:39:05
MIKE SIMMONS The idea of well, I've got an hour and a half, I want to talk for 25 minutes "ish" about this client and so forth. What I'm aware of is you're talking about the cauliflower, uh, and what you're talking about here is a shopping list for supervision. This is what I want to get from supervision. 

00:39:25
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yes, and increasingly people that can take charge of the supervision if you like. Because without that, uh, if they're not prepared, they may just start talking whatever comes up, the supervisor takes something up, and they end up somewhere that was very interesting, they go away and say, oh, I needed to talk about so and so. I completely forgot. I'll have to wait now. 

00:39:45
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, I'm, I'm just wondering, it's pretty clear that if I've got a problem with a client, I need to take that client to supervision. But what if I'm in one of those periods of working when I don't really have any problems with the clients. It feels like it's going fairly well, I haven't got a particular to take? 

00:40:10
LESLEY SPENCER Well, I think that could be interesting, I mean there could be a number of things there. I mean, one of the things could be, isn't it interesting that we think we should only take problems to supervision? Um, and actually, I think supervision should also be a time for kind of celebrating when, you know, things have gone well with a client, and reflecting on what we've learnt from that. Another thing that comes to mind is that sort of sometimes, um, people uh, sort of say, I've got nothing to talk about this week, everything's fine, and that's, that's a curious one, um, which might be worth exploring. Cause, it may be even possibly on an unconscious level, a kind of, um, a reluctance, or uh, a slight unwillingness to explore things. And for me, as a supervisor, I, I might just want to sort of actually address what's going on between me and the supervisee. To see if there's something that's happened that's made them feel a little bit reluctant to open up. Um, and that maybe there's some work that we need to do in our relationship to sort of try and put it back on, uh, a more balanced position so that you do feel okay. Um, supervisees um, are just like everybody else. If we think, um, we're going to be judged in some way, uh, we tend to hold back, so it's something about checking out, what is the healthful relationship like? 

00:41:40
ELS VAN OOIJEN What was interesting about what you said made me think about that. Because sometimes it happens that there is something fairly big, but somehow the supervisee is not consciously aware of it, and says I've got nothing to talk about. And I might do what you said, and I might also say, well, uh, just talk about who've you got at the moment, who are you seeing, and how's it going, and very often, ah, why wasn't I thinking of that, yes actually I do need to talk about X, Y, and Zed. And then there's something really big that somehow was so big that, yes. Yeah, that happens too. 

00:42:20
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, I'm just wondering how a counselor can make the best use of their supervision. Clearly it's really valuable, but how can they make sure they're getting that value? 

00:42:30
ELS VAN OOIJEN I think that, uh, first of all, prepare, of course as we talked about earlier. But I think it's really important that the supervisee, the counselor, is honest with him or herself. Is this really getting me what we want? Do I feel able to tell this supervisor everything? Can I be totally open? And that's why it's really important to evaluate how the supervisor, how the supervision is going. Both at the end of a session, if it's time. You know how have we been working together? And to be honest, to be able to be honest. But also from, from time to time, maybe every three or six months, and that can be part of the contract. To actually say okay, let's have a look at the last six months. How have we been working? What, what was really useful? And what wasn't useful? And if a supervisor doesn't offer that, as a supervisee, um, put it on the agenda, say that's, that's what you would like. So that you can have a really honest discussion. And, if it isn't quite working for you, for whatever reason, the supervisor and the supervisee just don't, don't quite fit, don't quite click, this part having worked together for six or nine months, it's still not quite working properly. To be able to actually honest about, then to say, well, maybe, maybe I need a different supervisor, because I don't for whatever reason I don't feel able to talk about everything I need to talk about. 

00:43:55
MIKE SIMMONS I'd like to follow that in a moment, but I just want to go back, because I'm conscious that in some way you're talking about evaluation of the supervisory relationship. At kind of quite a macro-level, that's going to help me make the most of it. Lesley I'm also thinking about things like, we're just keeping notes of, of the supervision, things like that. 

00:44:15
LESLEY SPENCER Yes, I, you know, I think as, as we talked about in the role play demonstration, um, it's very important to come prepared, but it's also very important to take notes of what goes on in supervision. Um, you know so what you come to, you know, in terms of an agreement of, you know how you're going to work together or the ideas that you've had. Um, I think that um, therapists who are natural reflectors really get a lot out of actually writing reflective notes doing that. I think you just have to bear in mind, um, to not put to many concrete details of, of the client in there. Um, this is for, you know, data protection reasons and things like that, in that your notes. I mean, if your notes are mostly reflecting on you and your experience, and, um, the client in a more indirect way, then that's probably okay, but the more you put in concrete terms about your client, the more you move into an are where your notes could be called. 

00:45:15
MIKE SIMMONS So, there's something about keeping notes, but also making sure those notes are appropriate to keep. Uh, I think there's something um, a phrase we often used about writing for disclosure, that you have an awareness that someday, someone might have the right to see what you've written. And as a result, you need to write with that in your head. Okay now, Els, a few minutes ago we were talking about this idea of when it doesn't quite seem to be working, and I guess there's a real tension here between, well it doesn't seem to be working wait I'll get another supervisor, that's an easy answer, and avoids things that I might really need to be looking at, the other side of that coin is we can't pretend that sometimes supervisory relationships don't actually break down. Sometimes they do. What happens there, how, how do you deal with it? 

00:46:10
ELS VAN OOIJEN Honesty, really. Is the most important thing. Um, and that's why I, it's all, it all stands and falls with the relationship. Either to you're able to build up a really good working relationship where both of you are able to say what you feel so that the supervisor is not scared to challenge the supervisee. And the supervisee is not scared to challenge the supervisor. You can actually be working, working well. And, if for whatever reason that isn't happening, that needs to be addressed. Now it could be the case, of course, ideally, that's why regular evaluation is important. That you're saying, well actually, I think you're really, as a supervisee to a supervisor you're really supportive, I've really feel, um, you really support me and I do feel able to say anything, but I'd like you to be a bit more challenging, you know, and, I'm not going to break down. Feel free to challenge me. And then the supervisor will so okay, great, I can be more challenging, for example. Or, uh, it could be the other way around of course, that the supervisee feels, um, uh, feels unable to say everything they want, I don't know why, but I am aware that I'm holding back. I still feel that I'm somehow judged by you, and this can then be explored. Yeah, what that might be about. Uh, and ideally gets explored and sorted out. It could be that it's a part of the process going on, maybe there's something going on with the client that's getting in the way. But everything needs to be explored. But sometimes the two of you maybe will have to say well, it's not quite, it isn't quite working. I'm not quite sure how, how how honest most people are going to be and say that to a supervisor. I think that they'll probably say, well, actually, I've been with you for a while now, and I'd like a different approach, or, you know. 

00:48:05
MIKE SIMMONS Or it's inconvenient for me now, because I've got this other job, I can't come on the day-, an excuse. 

00:48:15
ELS VAN OOIJEN I think so, but ideally, I prefer honestly, because personally as a supervisor, will always uh, say well, let's just look at how we've been working together, was there anything that you would've liked differently, because I need to learn from this as well. Both supervisor and supervisee learn from the reflective process, that sort of openness. 

00:48:35
MIKE SIMMONS Sure, and Lesley hearing Els speak I'm very aware of the parallels between the supervisor and supervisee relationship. And the client and counselor relationship. There are enormous similarities in the way that they will, if they're working successfully, in the way that they are operated. 

00:48:55
LESLEY SPENCER I think that's absolutely the case, uh, and I suppose that's why supervision is an important learning potential, um, for a supervisee, in that if they can have a good relationship with their supervisor, where they can do this kind of process talk and honest discussion, they, you know, they will have developed those skills and will be more likely to be able to use those skills with their client work. So it's, it's to address, to say the unsaid, we'll talk about those difficult things. I mean that's a, you know, a key thing, part of what therapists need to be able to do, and to model with clients. And so that's where those parallel processes work. 

00:49:35
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. One thing I'm conscious of is the rather unique aspect of a, counselor, supervisor, relationship if the counselor is a trainee counselor and they are on a course and in some way the supervisor is going to report back to the college running the course, about the counselor's work. That feels like quite a tricky issue. 

00:50:00
LESLEY SPENCER I think it is, potentially a tricky issue, because really, um, the student is in a triangular relationship. Because there's the student, and then there's the college where they're training. And the student knows that they're out on placement um and they're there really to learn how to apply the theory that they're learning in college in practice with real clients. And so there's a partnership between um, the college, student and the supervisor representing the agency. And, um, that does, I think very often create a tension for the student because the student knows the supervisor could pass or fail them. Um, so it's important to build that good relationship with the supervisor. Uh, and you know, just as Els was demonstrating in the role play that we did, you know, at the start of that relationship there can be huge amounts of anxiety. And one of the things that I say to both, you know, counseling students and to, to supervisors in training is that, uh, it's really important that, uh, an open dialogue an ongoing dialogue takes place, um, and uh, in particular I feel that actually, you know obviously students should be asking about how they're doing on the core, uh, you know in practice, and be getting feedback from the supervise, supervisor, um, but in particular, they need to be told by the supervisor as they go along their progress. And if there are particular areas for concern, that should be fed in as it happens. Uh, what we don't want is a situation where a student suddenly find um, they get their final report and they haven't passed and they had no idea that they weren't doing very well. 

00:51:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, yes, and I guess, in, that's just a reflection of the whole academic world. Students should always know that they're doing well or that they're doing badly, it should never come as a huge surprise to them. 

00:52:05
LESLEY SPENCER I'm gonna just add to that, as far as the final report is concerned, I think we both feel that that should always done in collaboration so that the student, him or herself will reflect on how am I doing, but how do I think I'm doing, so that it's very much part of the supervision process so that the assessment is done in collaboration together. Yeah. 

00:52:25
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, I think we pretty much coming to the end here, but just one final question. What advice would you give to a trainee counselor just starting off? 

00:52:35
LESLEY SPENCER I mean I, I would say, um, supervision is uh, potentially a tremendously rich experience. Um, I've always enjoyed my supervision experiences, and actually, um, they very often involve creative methods, um, they in-, involve a time that's for you to reflect on your practice, and that you learn a tremendous amount about counseling and practicing. You also learn a tremendous amount about yourself. And that if you put the effort in, if you do the preparation, if you can find the courage to have honest conversations with your supervisor, then in a sense, there's nothing more important, and nothing more rewarding for your continuing professional development as a counselor. 

00:53:20
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yes I, concur that, I would say it's a very, potentially, a very rich resource, uh, use it, you know. And enjoy it. 

00:53:30
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. Lesley, Els, thank you very much. 

00:53:35
LESLEY SPENCER Thank you. 

00:53:35
ELS VAN OOIJEN Thank you.

role play 1 a counsellor's first superv session - the contrac 

00:54:45
LESLEY SPENCER Okay, so, welcome Els. It's good to meet you, obviously I'm Lesley. And- 

00:54:55
ELS VAN OOIJEN Uh huh, good to meet you. 

00:54:55
LESLEY SPENCER Um, you will have gathered that you've been allocated to me for supervision. 

00:55:00
ELS VAN OOIJEN That's right, Tina said that, uh, you would be my supervisor, yes. 

00:55:05
LESLEY SPENCER Okay, so, um, I guess this is our opportunity to get to know each other a bit. 

00:55:10
ELS VAN OOIJEN Mm, that'd be good. 

00:55:10
LESLEY SPENCER Because, you know, um, a supervisory relationship is, is just as important as the sort of relationship that you're building with your clients. So it's really important that, you know we have a chance to, to talk and understand how we might work with each other. Uh, and, for me to work out any way how I can best help you, so that you can get the most out of supervision. 

00:55:35
ELS VAN OOIJEN I, we had a little bit of a lecture on supervision on the course, you know I'm in my second year at the moment, but I don't really know much about it. I guess you'll be checking my work, and you have the right to report on, on my wo-, my work, I guess? 

00:55:50
LESLEY SPENCER Well, that's true, you know, but as part of your diploma, you will need to have a, a report at the end. But for me that's not necessarily the starting point, because uh, I guess that's, um, perhaps given you a message that I'm just here to assess you. 

00:56:05
ELS VAN OOIJEN Um, well, yes, and I feel a bit nervous, I have to say. 

00:56:10
LESLEY SPENCER Yes, well, I mean, it would be, um, disingenuous of me to pretend that there isn't any assessment at all, but actually, um, that's only a part of it. I mean I think the thing that's really important in supervision is that um, we build a trusting relationship. One in which you feel that you can be yourself, and it's, it's ultimately, it's about um, find out how you're working with your clients, and for you to feel safe enough to talk about your clients, but also to bring you, because counseling's all about being in a relationship. So you being in a relationship with your clients, and you know, talking about how it's going and, uh, how you might do things, how you might work with the client. But also there's a very strong focus in the sort of supervision practice and practice that I know they do on your diploma, about thinking about you within the relationship. So what's going on with you, when you're working with the client. And, because of that, that means that you're going to need to be able to feel comfortable enough to open up a little bit, and say bits about yourself. Um, and so the relationship that, that you build with me is equally important. That you need to feel you can trust me and feel safe with me and that I'm not just there to assess you, but I'm actually there to help you, and to get the best out of supervision, and to grow and develop and actually, sometimes to have perhaps have a bit of a laugh, uh, and to um, be able to feel that it's okay to say, mm, I'm not sure I got this quite right. Supervision actually should be a place where it's, it's okay to acknowledge when you've made mistakes, and not fear that you're just going to be judged or, you're going to fail something. It's actually about the fact that very often the richest learning is when we do make mistakes. 

00:58:05
ELS VAN OOIJEN Well that'd be good, because I'm sure I'll make loads of mistakes, I mean I've just been allocated my first client, and we've had a couple of sessions, two sessions actually, and you know, it's so new and very nervous, still. Uh, but you said you won't, you, this is a relationship as well, so that sounds really good. And there's you say you want to get to know me, so I'm wondering what, how is it different from counseling, then, because I'm getting a bit confused as to what the difference is here. 

00:58:35
LESLEY SPENCER Okay, so, I mean I guess, um, that might have left you wondering, oh gosh, what's she going to want to know about me, and you know, is she going to end up counseling me and I wasn't thinking I was going to have therapy here. 

00:58:50
ELS VAN OOIJEN No, because I, I've got a therapist. 

00:58:50
LESLEY SPENCER Which is brilliant, that's great, um, I think you're absolutely right, um, you know, this is about supervision, so this is about talking about your clients and how you work with your clients. Um, but counseling is the kind of activity where it's not just about talking about a client as if they're out there and they have nothing to do with this. Because the main tool that you're using is you. So within supervision, you will talk about bits of yourself. You might, for instance, be talking about um, when your client brings a story or an experience to you, um, that perhaps pushes a few personal buttons with you. You know, it happens to us all on a regular basis, maybe there's a little bit of the client's story that is similar to our story. And, then that's kind of like, difficult for us, because in our head we might be playing out things that happened to us, and that can actually stop us from being fully present at the time. And that's what supervision really there for, is to create a safe place to talk about some of those things, so what was going on for you, when you were hearing the kinds of say that. And that's where there might be just a, a bit of a crossover between supervision and therapy. Now I'm not here to be your therapist, I'm sure that's a relief. 

01:00:15
ELS VAN OOIJEN Oh good. I'm sure you'd be a very good, but uh, yeah. 

01:00:20
LESLEY SPENCER It's, I'm not here to be your therapist, I'm actually here, um, to help make sure that, um, that you are clear when you're working with clients about what is their material and what is yours. So that you stay safe and also the client stays safe. So I might over time, and it's about building a trusting relationship, it doesn't happen just like that all relationships have to be built. I might over time um, be anticipating that you would feel okay to sort of share the bits of you which are being activated, the bits of your personal story, the bits of your history that are being activated in your therapeutic work. So perhaps together, we explore them only in as much as they are affecting your client work. And should something more significant emerge, which to be honest with you happens for everybody in their career as a counselor, there'll always be things that happen in our lives that, um, you know bring out issues, for instance, having a major bereavement, or you know, having some sort of difficulty or trauma which perhaps we thought we were okay about, but when we were find ourselves working therapeutically with a client, that stuff begins to bubble up and in a way that feels uncontrollable and perhaps a bit unhelpful. And if that kind of seems to be happening when we were talking, that might be when I suggest to you that that would be a good thing to take to your own therapist. And I'm sure that you be doing that anyway. You sound a lot like you're somebody who's really motivated to get the very best out of what you're doing as a counselor in training. 

01:02:00
ELS VAN OOIJEN Oh absolutely, really enjoying the training, it's hard work, and but no, I'm really enjoying. I'm loving it, yeah. But I'm really, uh, still quite, quite nervous, um, working with clients because I'm so, it's so new, so really relieved to be starting supervision with you, and it sounds really interesting, what you're saying, about things being activated, because, and it's funny that you mentioned bereavement, because the person I'm seeing has had the bereavement, and I had one, you know a little while ago, so yeah, I, I get a sense of, of what you're talking about. Yeah. 

01:02:35
LESLEY SPENCER And I guess, you know, understandably, um, that might make you a bit more sensitive about those things, and we, could go on later on, uh, and start to look at um, perhaps one of your clients, and what. I mean certainly, in supervision, because you're in training, um, usually the policy is that you need to talk about all of the clients that you're working with. 

01:03:00
ELS VAN OOIJEN I've only got one, so far. 

01:03:00
LESLEY SPENCER You've only got one so far. So that makes it nice and straightforward. Wondering if there's any, any other questions, when you thought about coming to see me today, what sort of things bubbled up in your, your mind. Uh, and they may be, you know, questions, could they have been concerns, or they may have been things that you weren't quite sure about. 

01:03:20
ELS VAN OOIJEN Well, I'm, I'm really hoping that uh, I'll be able to talk about what, what's happened in the sessions, and I basically want to know that what I'm doing is okay. And I very much, want to learn, you know. I want to learn to be, be a good counselor. But first of all, yeah, I really want the assurance that what I've done so far is all right, it seems to be okay, and the client came back and, you know, feel reasonable confident that she'll come back next week. But, um, yeah, I didn't really know what was involved because you know they said you need a supervisor. I thought well, on the one hand that's sometimes a good idea, because otherwise I'm very much on my own, no one really knows what I'm doing. On the other hand, it sounded quite scary, you know. Uh, are you going to tell me that, oh, you're, you're, not, you don't cut it? You're useless, you know. But the way you're talking has put me at my ease a bit. 

01:04:20
LESLEY SPENCER I mean because this is a, an ongoing relationship, it's something that, it's really important that you and I together address how we're doing. How are we working together? So a usual sort of pattern for me in the supervisory relationship would be to start off the session, uh, and ask you how you are, um, and you know, kind of like getting to know you type chat, but also, I think it's very often, um, helpful when you go to supervision that if there's something really significant going on for you, that the supervisor just gets to know that. Um, just because they can support you better in that. 

01:05:05
ELS VAN OOIJEN Hm, okay, so if there was something going on in my life you mean, that was- 

01:05:05
LESLEY SPENCER Yeah, I mean, you know, uh, significant things, I know that in the past I've gone to supervision and I've said to my supervisor, I've had a really difficult week. This has happened and that's happened, and I'm just feeling a bit flakey at the moment. And because I've built a relationship of trust with my supervisor, I know they're not rushing in to judge me, but they've immediately got a kind of sense of where I am, and then would I then go on and say and how I talk about my clients, they can see that through the lens of what I've shared with them. Uh, and that means that they can then um, modify or change how they're supporting me. So it's, it's a bit about actually feeling relaxed and feeling comfortable to do that. So kind of, I suppose checking in with each other at the start, and very often there's a, a bit, you know, if we had a previous session, or there were things from the last session that were just touch base on, we might have wanted to pick up again this time. So usually there's some sort of agenda type setting. What, what it means is, you know, you've got this hour, you've got an hour and a half, how are we going to use it? 

01:06:10
ELS VAN OOIJEN Oh I see. So I guess that means I need to think about it a bit beforehand. 

01:06:15
LESLEY SPENCER Yes, actually, you know, an hour, an hour and a half sounds a long time. 

01:06:25
ELS VAN OOIJEN It does, that sounds a very long time. 

01:06:25
LESLEY SPENCER And at this stage when you've got one client, um, that might say, oh, what am I going to talk for, for all that amount of time? But you'd be very surprised how quickly that goes. 

01:06:35
ELS VAN OOIJEN Oh I've got lots to talk about already actually. 

01:06:40
LESLEY SPENCER Um, and, um, actually if you start adding more clients in, which you will do with this agency, um, then you're going to find that you're gonna need to divide your time up. And I think it's, good for you to think in advance, I'm going to supervision, so say, you know you've seen a client, and you're writing your notes afterwards, it would be really helpful if you thought about what was it that you were going to talk about in supervision in relation to this client? So, uh, if you notice that, um, I don't know, you felt uh, perhaps confused, or you weren't sure what was going on with a client, in your note-taking afterwards, be reflecting on that in that way, so then when you come to supervision, I'm gonna be saying to you, you know, okay, so we know you need to talk about your clients, but what is it particularly you want to get out of this session? And in much the same way as in a way with clients that you might work with, you say if you both have a mutual understanding, of what it is that, you know, is, needs to be the focus, then it, supervision is going to work out much better as per counseling. 

01:07:55
ELS VAN OOIJEN So I can take my notes, my client notes with me, when I come to see you? 

01:07:55
LESLEY SPENCER Yes, that would, that would be excellent. I mean, I think that, I think you'd need to check if that was okay with the agency to access that. Um, but as far as in my way, that would be fine. It certainly, having done that pre-thinking, how am I going to use this time, you know, what do I really want to know. What, what questions do I want answered. I mean, sometimes it's just, I'm not sure what's going on. Can we just think about that? 

01:08:25
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, and what to do next, you know. 

01:08:25
LESLEY SPENCER And what to do next. And that's very often actually an anxiety for people that, um, tell me what to do. Tell me what to do. 

01:08:35
ELS VAN OOIJEN It, it's very often what, people come into supervision, especially when they're training, tell me what to do, and I'll do that, and then that will be okay. And, um, actually, part of the process of supervision uh, is helping counselors-in-training to sort of, kind of reflect, learning to reflect and think about what's going on with the client themselves. To develop what's called an internal supervisor, so starting to, to monitor themselves and noticing what's going on within themselves. And, um, sometimes I might um, suggest strategies or chapters that you can read. Sometimes what we might be doing is actually just being able to sit with the client as they are, in with the problems that they have. Because there isn't always an answer. And part of what counseling does is enabling the client to sit with, to tolerate their uncertainties, their doubts. And the counselor themselves needs to be able to do that too. 

01:09:40
ELS VAN OOIJEN Phew, sounds like a lot already. But yeah, it sounds good, so, I'm really looking forward to it, I'm sure I'll be able to learn a lot, a lot from you, yeah. And can I, when I come to supervision and maybe start is it okay to write notes for myself, because- 

01:09:55
LESLEY SPENCER Absolutely, it's fine. 

01:09:55
ELS VAN OOIJEN Okay, because otherwise I may just, not remember, you know. 

01:10:00
LESLEY SPENCER I think it's, it's good to do that. It's good to have that as a reflective space and, um, obviously to, to you know, I will keep a, a record of what we talk about in supervision, and um, it would be good for you to do so also. 

01:10:15
ELS VAN OOIJEN Oh you keep a record as well? 

01:10:20
LESLEY SPENCER I do. Um, in some instances, uh, you know it can be helpful to run it a mutual record, but I think there may be additional reflective notes that you might want to take home. 

01:10:30
ELS VAN OOIJEN Probably, yeah, yeah. 

01:10:30
LESLEY SPENCER Now I mean, I want to just go back to your starting point because you said oh, am I there to assess you I'm going to be assessing you all the time. 

01:10:40
ELS VAN OOIJEN Well yes, I mean because I, in fact, I brought it with me I can show you. I have a little package for you to see, and also uh, as a report form that's, at the end of the year. Um, I think they want you to fill it in. 

01:10:50
LESLEY SPENCER Yeah, so I was talking about what we might averagely do within a supervision session, and I was talking about is it a kind of um, building a relationship, and kind of like touch and base, how are we, what's going on, etcetera, finding out about you, um, and then finding out what the focus was, and then I guess the main part of supervision might be about actually looking at your clients and thinking about them, and thinking about what's going on, uh, and um, helping you develop those skills that reflect on you and relationship with the client and you in relationship with me. And then towards the end of this session, um, we might sort of reflect on what you're taking away, or what you found useful. Um, what you're not sure about. And then that, at that very final bit, we'd probably be sort of settling okay, how have we worked together today? So there's something about really us all the time touch and base, needn't be necessarily in a huge labored way, but actually in order to make this relationship well, we need to keep on, ongoing-ly just sort of checking out. You know, I might say one day, oh, feels like we, we've had a really challenging session today, and I'm wondering how you're left. You know what are you feeling now? So it's kind of like that very honest sort of type discussion. And the reason I, I want to say that is because it, it's about actually making sure the relationship's working well, but also so that you don't feel when it comes to us writing that report, which is in, you know, seven months' time, that there are any surprises. So in other words, if I felt at any concern about your practice, I would be feeding that into all our ongoing dialogue as we go along. Um, I'm also um, going to be making suggestions for how to, um, you know, read, how to develop, you know, your skills, your knowledge-base. 

01:12:50
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, that's what I, that's what I really need. And also you mentioned you might say, suggest some chapters or articles I could read, that'd be really helpful. Yeah. 

01:13:00
LESLEY SPENCER And we're also likely to spend quite a lot of time thinking about uh, ethical practice, and um, how the ethical framework applies to the clients that you're working with. 

01:13:10
ELS VAN OOIJEN I had a look at it, but it looks really complicated, I'm not sure that I quite understand it all yet. But yeah that'd be good. 

01:13:15
LESLEY SPENCER So, so that essentially, you should have a, a pretty good idea of, of how, um, I'm experiencing you, and if I have any concerns, and I'm not anticipating those, but, but the dialogue needs to be open between us all the time, so you know where you are. And it's also a two-way transaction, so that, you know, if there's something that's going on in supervision that I'm doing that's making you feel uncomfortable or threatened or, um, making you feel reluctant to talk about client situations, then actually that's something that we really need to address. Because supervision is only as good as what we both put into it. And if there's something that's going on between you and I is making you withdraw into yourself, then the supervisory process isn't going to work very effectively, and the bottom line is that will mean that you're not talking about your client work, and you may find yourself, you know, hiding something, getting anxious about it which won't help your clients as well. 

01:14:20
ELS VAN OOIJEN No, it wouldn't. Gosh it does sound like a lot. But it'll always be here? 

01:14:25
LESLEY SPENCER It will always be here. 

01:14:25
ELS VAN OOIJEN And, and I'm not sure how, how often will it be, will it be every week, will or- 

01:14:35
LESLEY SPENCER Okay, supervision with us is, uh, one's a fortnight. For an hour and a half. Um, the, the ACP basically say that you need to have uh, an hour and a half supervision, a minimum hour and a half supervision per month. Um, and I think it's something like, uh, one out of every eight hours counseling practice. 

01:15:00
ELS VAN OOIJEN Oh, doesn't sound like a lot. 

01:15:00
LESLEY SPENCER It doesn't. And actually you're lucky because this agency here really prioritizes supervision, so you're going to get quite a lot. Uh, then we can be really looking at your training. 

01:15:10
ELS VAN OOIJEN Oh that'll be good so we'll be able to, to learn a lot. That feels really reassuring, yeah. Yeah, that feels good. Yeah. And do I need to pay for it, that wasn't made clear? 

01:15:20
LESLEY SPENCER Ah, well you don't need to pay for it, the agency pays for it. 

01:15:25
ELS VAN OOIJEN Oh, I thought that was probably the case, but I, on the course there's been some discussion- 

01:15:30
LESLEY SPENCER No you don't need to pay for it. Um, but in the future, were you to go into private practice after you've qualified- 

01:15:35
ELS VAN OOIJEN Oh I'm hoping to, yes. 

01:15:40
LESLEY SPENCER Uh, then, yes you would be paying for it. 

01:15:40
ELS VAN OOIJEN Oh, okay. 

01:15:40
LESLEY SPENCER I'm trying to think, is there anything else that I haven't covered in terms of the preliminary kind of things that you might want to know- 

01:15:50
ELS VAN OOIJEN I, I didn't know very much about it, but what you said sounds, sounds very good, it sounds like as you were saying, same as I need to build up a relationship with the client, this will be a relationship, I like, I like that. I still feel very nervous, I have to say. But, I feel, I feel a lot better, yeah. 

01:16:10
LESLEY SPENCER Well, I'm, I guess what I want to say now is that, you know, we've been dialoguing, we've been talking about, and in a way what we've been doing is sort of forming a kind of a contract between us, an understanding between us of how we're going to work together. And that's not a kind of like, you do it once and that's it. What I've been saying is it's part of an ongoing dialogue. So I'm wondering if what might be helpful here because I can understand that you're feeling a bit anxious, is if we actually move on and do a bit of supervision now? And perhaps you start to tell about your client, and then you'll get a real feel of you know how we're working and you can talk, leave a few minutes at the of the session to talk about, you know, how you're feeling now after the session. 

01:16:45
ELS VAN OOIJEN That'll be good, because I've seen this client twice, and yes, I, I really, I would really appreciate talking, talking about her, absolutely. Yeah. 

01:16:55
LESLEY SPENCER Okay, so where would you like to start? 

01:16:55
ELS VAN OOIJEN Um, okay, I've seen her twice- 

01:17:00
role play 2 supervision with a couns after about nine month 

01:17:05
[sil.] 

01:17:10
ELS VAN OOIJEN Oh, hi Lesley. 

01:17:10
LESLEY SPENCER Hi. 

01:17:10
ELS VAN OOIJEN Oh I'm so pleased to come to supervision today, I really, really need it. 

01:17:15
LESLEY SPENCER Gosh. 

01:17:15
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah. 

01:17:15
LESLEY SPENCER What's been happening? 

01:17:20
ELS VAN OOIJEN Well, uh, as you know I've got three clients now, and uh, two of them are, uh, are going fine, but the third one, I feel a bit worried about, and uh, really she's not, you know, I brought her last, last time, and um, it's, it's Mary. 

01:17:35
LESLEY SPENCER Right. 

01:17:40
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, uh, the woman in, in her late, in her late 30s was really depressed. 

01:17:45
LESLEY SPENCER Okay, so let me just check out and, and so, sounds like this, there's a lot going on for you at the moment, and you're worried about your clients. Do you want to go straight and talk about the clients, or is there anything else that you should just- 

01:17:55
ELS VAN OOIJEN Well, um, well actually, I'm um, I'm really pleased, because on the course I had my essay back, you know, that does say that's a, well, ethics, I was so worried about, and I, you know, I got a good grade, so um, it's such a relief. It's such a real relief, I have to say. But, uh, I'm a bit um, I'm a bit preoccupied as well because my husband's just been made redundant, and, uh, you know. Yes. 

01:18:25
LESLEY SPENCER Right, is that come out of the blue? 

01:18:25
ELS VAN OOIJEN Uh, well, we knew the industry wasn't doing well, but he thought he was pretty safe, you know, but uh, yeah. I mean he's got another month, but then, yeah, then, he'll have to look for another job, yeah. So that's, that's at the back of my mind I suppose, yeah. 

01:18:45
LESLEY SPENCER Well I'm noticing why I'm shocked at what you've just said, so and I'm not even directly affected so I can only imagine that's, a massive thing for you and your husband. 

01:18:55
ELS VAN OOIJEN It is, it is. So we, we do well on the course and, poss-, hopefully, being able to enter some, some more money, has become quite a burden. 

01:19:05
LESLEY SPENCER So it's, it's put your, what you're doing, the training on the course, and your future into it a different kind of perspective. 

01:19:15
ELS VAN OOIJEN Uh, it has. Hm, it is really, unless he can find something else, I mean, he's actually taking it quite well, he says, oh, I'll be all right. But he's like that, I'm the one, I'm the worrier, yeah I worry about it. Yeah. 

01:19:30
LESLEY SPENCER So it's, it's really gone in for you and it sounds like you're feeling, you're carrying the stress. And then he says, maybe like he's a little bit denying it, he's, I'll be okay- 

01:19:35
ELS VAN OOIJEN Oh he doesn't want me to be, you know, maybe he's just putting a break something because he doesn't want me to worry because he knows I do, you know, but yeah. And he's not a great talker. Yeah, you know he's great and he's a good man, but he's not a great talker. 

01:19:50
LESLEY SPENCER So, so when did you actually get this news? 

01:19:55
ELS VAN OOIJEN Last week. 

01:19:55
LESLEY SPENCER Last week, so still pretty fresh for you, I mean you must be reeling, really. 

01:20:00
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah. Mm hmm, yeah. To be honest, yeah. 

01:20:05
LESLEY SPENCER And so what's that felt like for you, cause see, now you've got three clients, you say at the moment, so what's that felt like for you? You know, having to get into client work. 

01:20:15
ELS VAN OOIJEN Well actually, it's been all right, because it's almost that, when I, you know when I come here, and I'm going to the room and I see my clients, I don't know it's almost I, I'll put it over there. Uh, I don't know where it comes in at some level, but, yeah, I just focus completely on them. Yeah. 

01:20:35
LESLEY SPENCER Right, so, in a way you you're saying you switch off from that, has actually working with clients been a distraction for you, is that what you're saying? 

01:20:45
ELS VAN OOIJEN I guess so, yeah, I guess so, yeah. Yeah, it's, it's a time when I can focus on something else. Yeah. 

01:20:50
LESLEY SPENCER Yeah, cause obviously, you know you've been on the course some time now, and we've seen quite a lot of times that are kind of like, you know, seen lots going on in us when we're working with clients and things like that. So from what you're saying, you're not consciously aware of it having intruded- 

01:21:10
ELS VAN OOIJEN No, but actually, I don't know, maybe, maybe there is something, um, regarding Mary, yeah. Yeah, maybe, I haven't really consciously thought about it maybe, because I didn't want to, but yeah. Maybe, may be worth exploring a bit I'm now thinking. 

01:21:30
LESLEY SPENCER Okay, and is that how you, you'd like to talk about Mary, I've got that, that's the number one thing- 

01:21:35
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, at this time I'd like to talk about the other two clients as well, but, but uh, Mary has been on my mind a bit. 

01:21:40
LESLEY SPENCER Okay, all right. So, it sounds like that's where you'd like to begin. 

01:21:45
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yes, of course, last time we met I'd only seen her once, and I've seen her four times now, so that means of course we've got, only got two sessions left. And, um- 

01:22:00
LESLEY SPENCER So that, that feels like that's gone quite quickly? 

01:22:05
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, well she's in such a bad state, she's really appreciative of the counseling, she says it really helps, that somebody listens to her. But, you know, her situation hasn't changed, and she's still very depressed. Uh, you know, she feels she's in a dead end job, you know, she's in in, in ataman, there's some sort of ataman typing, some sort of job for the council, and um, you know her, her marriage is, is well she's in the middle of a, of divorce. That she didn't want, you know her husband basically, went with somebody else, yeah. I think I told you that last time. Yeah, it, and uh, she's just really, really depressed, she cries in every session, and I'm thinking I've only got two sessions left, and how, what, what good am I doing, you know? How can I, how can I help this woman? Um, she comes, you know she comes every time, she comes and she appreciates it, but I, I, I listen, and I, I empathize, etcetera, but she's not in a good space. And it feels really hard. 

01:23:20
LESLEY SPENCER I guess what I'm noticing, I'm noticing within me, and I'm wondering if it's you, it sort of your energy level's changed. I'm noticing myself feeling quite flattened there, and I'm wondering if that's- 

01:23:35
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah. That is quite true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, I do feel, I, I guess I feel a bit depressed with her, maybe, cause she's so down. And she, she feels so depressed, you know she goes to work, and she comes home and then she has to look after her kids, and her husband's set up home with the, somebody else, and she, I guess she just doesn't seem a way forward, or she feels well, is, is this how my life's going to be, and I'm going to be on my own for the rest of my life, and uh, uh, and I sort of feel, uh, and I really like her, I really like her but it does feel very heavy. Yeah. 

01:24:20
LESLEY SPENCER Right, right, so you feel yourself sort of almost sliding down the chair with her. 

01:24:25
ELS VAN OOIJEN I do, really. It's not good, is it? Uh, so I could do with some ideas as to, as to what to do. You know, because we've only got two sessions left, so I feel a bit of a pressure to, to make some sort of a change, and as you know, you know at the end of the six-session we always have to say, you know, how do you feel now, on a scale of one to 10, I'd hate it to be two, you know. It wouldn't look very good, would it? But also for her, you know, I'd like to know that, I'm helping her. And I'm not, I'm not sure that I am. 

01:25:00
LESLEY SPENCER Right, so it sounds like there's a number of different things going on there. Uh, one of the things I'm hearing is, um, you feeling I've got to make things better. 

01:25:10
ELS VAN OOIJEN I know that's not what I'm supposed to be feeling, but I do. 

01:25:15
LESLEY SPENCER So, so what I'm hearing is, I've had four sessions, she's only got two left, it's, it's almost as if um, what I'm getting from you is, is a, I should've waved my magic wand and she should all be better by now. And if she isn't, then I'm, what would it be? 

01:25:30
ELS VAN OOIJEN Well, I know I can't be better because I know it's her situation but I'd guess I'd like her to see things a bit differently, yes, I would be, I would be pretty useless as a counselor. On the one hand, I know that's not what it's about, but on the other hand, what am I doing? If, if it doesn't make a difference? I guess I'd like to make some sort of a difference. Yeah. 

01:25:55
LESLEY SPENCER So you'd like to make some sort of difference, and I guess the other thing is, and let me just check this out with you, um, this is relatively recent for Mary, isn't it? 

01:26:05
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, she's going through the divorce now, I mean he moved out I think four months ago. 

01:26:10
LESLEY SPENCER Right, so, you know, if we were to, to reflect on perhaps some of the theory that you've done in college, where would you see her in terms of, um, dealing with loss, really? 

01:26:25
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, I suppose it is a loss, isn't it? Well, I think she's in the depression stage, I mean, she, she was angry at first, uh, but she's now sort of, just really sort of... down. She knows it's happening, because, yeah, it is happening. And she's just really depressed, I guess in that stage. 

01:26:50
LESLEY SPENCER So this, there's something about, thinking about where she is in, you know she's had a terrible blow, she's had a terrible loss, and uh- 

01:27:00
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, that's, that's what actually you're saying, because it did come out of the blue for her. Apparently it had been going on for a while, he's been seeing this woman, I think for two years actually, but she had absolutely no idea. When he said he was working late, she just always believed him, and so it's come as a terrible blow. 

01:27:20
LESLEY SPENCER So, the shock, unexpected, nothing to prepare her. Um, and then it's a major life change, and also the fact that he was cheating on her, so lot, lots of those sorts of things going on. 

01:27:35
ELS VAN OOIJEN And the kids of course are not seeing their father as, as often, although she said he is a good father, he sees them as often as he can, but in reality, of course it's not like how it was. 

01:27:45
LESLEY SPENCER And I, you know, so there are those things, and I'm just also mindful of the fact that you have also recently had a shock, haven't you? 

01:27:55
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah. Yeah, yeah, maybe I, yeah. I hadn't really consciously thought about that. Maybe, but yeah, I have. I'm in a different position. But, uh, you know it has been a shock, yeah. 

01:28:15
LESLEY SPENCER Because you know, obviously, um, life happens to us, doesn't it, it happens to counselors too, um, and, you know, I guess what I, what I'm wondering is, what it felt like um, you know, this thing happened with your husband, being made redundant and it was very recent, you in your own way are a likely to be reeling from that kind of shock. And then you're working with a client who's, who's really quite low at the moment. 

01:28:45
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, so I just wonder, are you saying that maybe I shouldn't, that it's not a good idea for me to see clients with those sort of problems at the moment, because of what's happened, I'm not sure. 

01:29:00
LESLEY SPENCER Well I think that would be, uh, premature for me to say that. I'm not saying that particularly. I think, um, if this were, you know, if the two of us together felt this was a, a big thing, but I guess what I'm wanting us to reflect on was, uh, and acknowledging, looking after you, that you know, you've, you've been dealing with a big thing, and actually, uh, in terms of transference and counter-transference, experiencing uh, other people's low moods, you know when we're working with very depressed clients, it's true for every single one of us that it, we kind of like, can suck it up, like a sponge. Uh, and I suppose one of the things that we might reflect on was, whether you felt as low yourself with Mary, all the time that you worked with her, or whether it felt particularly bad for you this last week, with the news that you've just been given. This body blow that you've just personally received. 

01:30:10
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, no I deeply felt it this week. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah initially I was working with her, but no, I think that is true, I wasn't, I wasn't quite as sucked in, but at the moment, I am. I hadn't really thought about that. But, I'm not depressed myself, no I'm not, because I feel well, let's see what we can do, about that, I mean that's , that's um, push him, don't need to push him to find another job, and how are we gonna manage if he doesn't, so that's, you know, sort of coping mode if you like. Uh, but yeah, you've got a point there. 

01:31:05
LESLEY SPENCER And, and that's understandable isn't it? I mean. 

01:31:05
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, I thought I could, I was leaving it out there, outside the door, but of course, I mean, yes, clearly it has affected me more and maybe that's why I sort of really feel that, depression. So is that a good thing or is that a bad thing? I'm not sure where I go with this now. 

01:31:25
LESLEY SPENCER Well, I, I guess you came through the door, really worried about Mary, but also feeling quite, kind of weighed down yourself. Um, and you know, um, you know, you were, you've been quite up front about having had this bad news um, about your husband's job and things like that. I mean really, what it comes down to is, um, how that affects you on, on a longer term basis. Now, I'm right in thinking, aren't I, of that you're in therapy, so, so you've been able to use that opportunity in the way, have you seen your therapist in the week that we've- 

01:32:05
ELS VAN OOIJEN I'm seeing him tomorrow. 

01:32:05
LESLEY SPENCER Right, okay. You know, so, you know you're doing things to look after yourself. And that's, that's also part of the function of, of supervision is that, that kind of like, supportive element of that, you know life happens to all, to therapists too, to all sorts of things like that. 

01:32:25
ELS VAN OOIJEN -to talk more and offload it, yes. Last week I, you know, um, he was away on holiday last week, so I haven't actually been able to talk about it much to anybody, so, yeah. That's also true. 

01:32:35
LESLEY SPENCER So, I mean it, it may well be that for you, personally, um, not that anything can, anyone can take that away, the fact that your husband's lost his job, but actually feeling held in therapy yourself, um, may help you feel um, less drained. Cause actually, I guess that's what I was getting from you was this sense that-, yes, I felt sliding down the chair, I felt this kind of drained-ness from you. Um, thinking about Mary as well as, you know there was the other bit which was the kind of like the anxiety of, am I, am I going to be, you didn't say this, and so this might not be quite right, but something about am I gonna be good enough. I need to prove myself in some way. I've got to do something wonderful in succession. Does that fit or not? 

01:33:25
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, I mean I guess, that is how I feel, you know. If she's as depressed as after six sessions, as she was when she came in, um, you know, would a more experienced counselor, have made more of a difference, I guess is, is what I'm wondering. 

01:33:40
LESLEY SPENCER Okay, so, so that's the fantasy. The fantasy is, the more experienced counselor would've wrapped Mary up and she'd be beaming now. 

01:33:50
ELS VAN OOIJEN Well no, that's going too far. Because there is, right, reality of her situation, but might be able to, you know, lift her a little, maybe. Yes, certainly my fantasy. 

01:34:05
LESLEY SPENCER So I'm, I'm kind of wondering, if we, um, we've kind of looked at, at your counter-transference, we've looked at the sort of things that were being activated in you, and how that might connect what's going on in your personal life. Is there anything else there that you think that we need to, to look at? In particular with regards to you? 

01:34:25
ELS VAN OOIJEN Mm, well no actually, it's, it's made me realize, because there's so much proxy over there, that's my private life, that's my client. And realizing that actually, not having been able to talk in, in therapy about it yet. Because I haven't really wanted to talk about my parents, uh, because uh, basically I haven't talked to anybody about it in particularly. Except yeah, he's lost his job, oh he'll be all right, that sort of thing, haven't really been able to talk about how I feel. Uh, and you're reminding me if you like, that, that's the case. I haven't realized I've just been getting on with it. Uh, so, makes me feel better because I know I'll be able to talk about it a little more now. That will be good. Yeah, what about Mary, though? 

01:35:15
LESLEY SPENCER Well, I just want to say I'm really glad you were able to talk about here, that felt really important. That you could be you, in here, and acknowledge those things. So, yes, perhaps what we need to do is now focus on what you're doing with Mary. So would you like to kind of give me a bit of a recap of you know, how you've been working with Mary so far, if we, not just focusing on the last session, but can you give me a kind of sense of um, those three sessions that you had before that last one, and then we'll look at the last one. 

01:35:55
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah. Yeah, in the first session, she basically just talked, you know, and I, I didn't get a chance to say very much and she cried a lot, etcetera. Uh, and then in in, in the other two, I mean, she still cries, and it does, it does, it does feel quite circular, if you like, uh, in that she says, I don't know why this has happened, I, I've been, a good wife to him, and, um, and what's happened to my life. Here I am, I've got two kids on my own now, and no husband, and um, I've got a really, a job that, you know, pays reasonably well, I don't know, it was okay, but uh, and basically, what's it all about? You know, here I am, and is this what life is for? You know? And that was particularly the case, that's, that's what she has been talking, and I, what I've done is listened, and I've also done some reframing, and I, I sort of, uh, this didn't work at all, but I asked her to keep a fold record, you know, and, um. 

01:37:15
LESLEY SPENCER So you were thinking of trying some- 

01:37:20
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah. But that didn't work. She, uh, she didn't do it. Um, but her, her thinking, she, she's definitely a glass half empty person. So what I'm doing in the session is trying to, when she says something to, um, when she says, oh well, you know I'm on my own now, and um, who's going to want a woman of, uh, 38, you know past it, and I've got two kids, and obviously I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life now. I'm sort of trying to help her to reframe that a bit, and does she know other people. That's happened to, and that sort of thing. And, you know, and that seems to work in the session. She'll say oh yeah, I've got my, there's so and so and so and so, but I can't see that happening to me. You know, uh, who's going to want me. I was never that popular with, with the boys, and you know, was so happy when uh, when Mike asked me to marry him and, you know, um, so I've been sort of prodding her a bit and challenging her a bit, if you like. But that in the last session, uh, none of that seemed to go anywhere. And she was just really depressed. And maybe I wasn't at my best actually thinking about it now, because I've got the little, useless really. Yeah. 

01:38:40
LESLEY SPENCER That sounds quite harsh. 

01:38:45
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, I, I guess, but it's how I felt. Yeah. 

01:38:45
LESLEY SPENCER You, you felt pretty useless. 

01:38:50
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, because she is so depressed. Yeah, now, I, I did actually say to her, uh, how depressed are you, you know because she, and she says, oh I would never do anything like that. I, I've got my kids. But uh, if that wasn't the case, you know, I don't know if I would wanna be here, but now, no I would never do anything. So she did say that to me too. 

01:39:20
LESLEY SPENCER Okay, so you, you've checked out, you've, you know, you've wondered about the possibility that she might be so depressed that- 

01:39:25
ELS VAN OOIJEN Well I was beginning to-, I was beginning to wonder, because she, she sort of disappointed in it all and that sort of thing. What do you think? I mean, do I need to say well, she says she, her, she herself said, oh, I would never do anything, but. You know, so. 

01:39:40
LESLEY SPENCER Well, uh, if I remember from the first session that we talked about, you know whether if they're, came from, um, the, with her GP was involved, and you know, she, her, am I right in thinking she just been put on anti-depressants? 

01:39:55
ELS VAN OOIJEN She is on anti-depressants. 

01:39:55
LESLEY SPENCER And so, you know, she's been, diagnosed by the doctors- 

01:40:00
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, I, I, yeah that's right, because she hadn't been put on, on them yet, so after our last session, I, I talked with her, and wondered whether she might, might like to go and see her GP, so she did that. And her GP did put her on, on anti-depressants. So I guess, maybe they're not quite kicking in yet. Yeah. 

01:40:25
LESLEY SPENCER That's important to make that link, isn't it? 

01:40:25
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, that's true, actually. Cause with some people it takes a bit longer than with others. 

01:40:30
LESLEY SPENCER So, uh, you know, but it's good that you were noticing that she was that depressed that, you know, suicide might be a risk. 

01:40:40
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah. 

01:40:40
LESLEY SPENCER And, you know, in a gut sense, you know, how, how convinced did you feel about her answer? 

01:40:50
ELS VAN OOIJEN Well, yes, I do, because she loves her kids, I can't imagine her doing it to her kids. But on the other hand, could she slide even further, I mean. You know, I'm, I'm pretty sure she's not going to do it now, but could she you know, and because we only have two more sessions, could she maybe finish or slide further down. 

01:41:10
LESLEY SPENCER Hm, so that, that's the worry that we might be thinking about how would you know, what would you be seeing? That would indicate to you that she was sliding down even further? 

01:41:15
ELS VAN OOIJEN Well I guess if she was more depressed, and uh, was becoming, um, less focused on her kids, maybe, you know. Feeling that she was a bad mother. Would be better-, that they would be better off without her, something like that, maybe. No, she hasn't said anything like that. 

01:41:35
LESLEY SPENCER Okay, so you're, you're monitoring that, you're thinking about those- 

01:41:40
ELS VAN OOIJEN It's on my mind. It's on my mind. Which is really heavy, yeah. 

01:41:50
LESLEY SPENCER Okay, so, you know, we've been doing some really important stuff in thinking about Mary, thinking about, in um, the parameters, really, the safety parameters that she's been with her GP, she's on tablets, um, you've done some exploratory work with her to think about whether there is a suicide risk or not. And ultimately, you know, you've got six sessions with her, um, and it may be at the end of those six sessions, if the tablets haven't kicked in sufficiently, to lift her mood, and you think that she's going downhill, uh, that may be an issue of referring her on, or asking her permission to go back to the GP. Um, and, I guess what I've picked up, with you is that you've been um, uh, you know, staying with her uh and you know she's been crying quite a lot of the time, and, you said oh it feels like we're going around in circles. I, I guess there's a sort of a level of, feeling the frustration, maybe, it's, to some extent, maybe the frustration's partly with yourself, partly with her, um, but you said oh, I feel useless. 

01:43:00
ELS VAN OOIJEN Is that what I said? Okay. I suppose I do really. Yeah, to some extent. It's also the situation she's in, but yeah, certainly this week, it, yeah. 

01:43:15
LESLEY SPENCER You said it's also the situation that she's in. So I'm wondering if we were going back to thinking about transference and counter-transference. What do you think might be going on there, Els? 

01:43:30
ELS VAN OOIJEN Uh, right, you're saying the situation she's in? 

01:43:35
LESLEY SPENCER So think about your feeling. And what might that tell you about Mary? 

01:43:40
ELS VAN OOIJEN Hm. You know I'm going completely blank. Can't think? Yeah, that's really interesting. Yeah, just, as you, as you asked me that question, it's almost as if I was grasping at something, and then I just went totally blank. I guess, I guess you're hinting at, um, me being in a difficult situation at the moment, with my husband being, being made redundant, and, and Mary's situation both for which I, it's a situation I'm in, and the situation she's in. Hm. 

01:44:25
LESLEY SPENCER So, that sounds like that's a bit of an uncomfortable thought for you, though. The parallels. 

01:44:30
ELS VAN OOIJEN Uh, well, it's not the same, but you were making, you were picking up on that I said I feel useless. And it goes, which is interesting, because as far as my husband's job is concerned, of course there's nothing I can do about that. I like to sort things out, I like to fix things, you know, I'm the one at home who sorts things out, and of course I can't. I hardly understand what he does, you know, it's, that's his world. He'll have to do it. So in a way, apart from you know, making sure he, he puts in many applications, I mean, I, I do feel useless there, I can't sort it out. I can't do anything about it. Yeah. Yeah. 

01:45:20
LESLEY SPENCER And with Mary? 

01:45:25
ELS VAN OOIJEN Oh yeah. Yeah, there's probably a similarity there. Yeah. Hm. And of course, I know it's not my, my job to sort out a situation. That's not what this is about. And I guess all I can, I know that all I can do is, be with her and support her and maybe help her to see things a little bit differently and if she isn't ready to do that, then, I guess she's not ready to do that. Because I also realize that, you know, stuff we're studying on the course, and I also know from my own experience, bereavements that it takes a lot longer than a few weeks. So she may just need to be like this for a bit. Yeah. Actually, I feel lighter now. Hm. I do feel lighter as if, you know, before I did feel like that, and it all just sort of, all right, that's there, but, yeah, you know. 

01:46:20
LESLEY SPENCER Well, I'm wondering, do you think what do you think Mary feels herself? Do you think she might feel useless? 

01:46:30
ELS VAN OOIJEN Oh yeah. I think she feels a complete failure. Well, not as a mother. I, I think she's feels pretty confident that she's a good mother. But I think she feels useless as a, as a wife, I guess. Here she was, no idea, thought she was, you know, happily married, and all the time, he's been seeing someone else. I mean that is just awful. You feel such an idiot, wouldn't you? 

01:47:05
LESLEY SPENCER Yeah, and have difficulty in trusting yourself or anybody. Because I guess she must feel duped in some sort of way. 

01:47:15
ELS VAN OOIJEN Well of course she does. Actually, it's interesting, because as I talk about it, I feel really angry, but she's more depressed than angry, you know. And more, oh well, who would want me, but uh, but I actually on the whole feel really angry. Yeah. 

01:47:30
LESLEY SPENCER So maybe you're feeling the anger that she's not able to access or hold at the moment. And that's giving you, you're noticing the change in your energy. You seem more energized. And we know those, the anger and depression are two sides. But- 

01:47:55
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah, so maybe I'm feeling what she's not feeling, you're saying. Could be. So, so as far as the um, the last two session with her then, do you feel that I s should help her to get in touch with her anger? 

01:48:10
LESLEY SPENCER Hm, what would that feel like? What would you do? 

01:48:20
ELS VAN OOIJEN Well, I guess maybe I could tell her that. I don't know what do you think I could say well actually, I feel quite angry on your behalf. Um, how about you? But I actually feel quite angry, would that be an okay thing to say? 

01:48:40
LESLEY SPENCER How do you thinks he's going to respond from what you know of her now? 

01:48:45
ELS VAN OOIJEN I don't know. Actually I'm trying, um, uh, I'm not sure that it will go anywhere at this stage. I, I just see her sort of, not doing anything with that. Somehow. Sort of, god's sake woman! You know, you've got every reason to be angry. You know, um. But no, I, at the moment I'm not sure that it would go anywhere. But maybe she should know anyway. That, uh, because I sort of feel, well, she has got a reason to be angry, she must be angry at some level, who wouldn't be? Just to, flag it up maybe, even if it doesn't go in. 

01:49:35
LESLEY SPENCER I'm, I'm wondering if you've ever had an experience where uh, perhaps, you know, your husband or your friends uh, have felt something very strongly your behalf, which you're not, you haven't been ready to feel? 

01:50:00
ELS VAN OOIJEN Hm, can't think, I'm sure that's happened. Can't really think of anything. Oh, I think, well it was quite a long time ago, when I was ill. And, I think people were worried about me, it didn't last very long. Uh, my husband was worried about me, but I wasn't at all. I was fine, just ill. And it wasn't until later that I realized how ill I had been. I don't know where I wasn't ready to feel it, I just didn't. You know. Why are they so worried? Why are they so worried, I'll be all right. Yeah. So. 

01:50:50
LESLEY SPENCER So maybe there's something about trusting that, that the anger will come from Mary. If you put your anger onto her, what's likely to happen? 

01:51:05
ELS VAN OOIJEN Oh, I don't want to put my anger onto her. But you're saying that, I guess I would just say, just wondering whether, whether she has any anger, and if she doesn't, than she doesn't, but just flag it up that, there is another way of reacting to this, and anger is one of them. That's all I would want to say, I guess. Not throw my anger, like my husband's job is, no that wouldn't be right, no. 

01:51:40
LESLEY SPENCER No, right, no that wasn't what I was suggesting. But I think it's sometimes as a counselor, because we suck up all those feelings from clients, and, and there's a process where we're feeling the feelings for them that they're not currently ready or able to acknowledge. 

01:51:55
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yes, so she may not be ready for that, yeah. Yeah, could be. 

01:52:00
LESLEY SPENCER And she's splitting it off. From herself. 

01:52:05
ELS VAN OOIJEN Yeah maybe she just wants to-, so you're saying, sounds like you're saying, maybe she just needs to be depressed for the time being, this is a normal phase of, of, a normal reaction to a loss. And it hasn't been that long. And maybe this is just how she is, but. 

01:52:25
LESLEY SPENCER Well, I guess that, there is a, you know the tension is that you've got a limited number of sessions, and you want, and you want to make changes. But she's had a huge blow. And, um, I gue-, you know, one of the things that you could explore with her was, previous experiences where this is part of a, she's had previous losses, or depressions, or times, so, you know, it feels like she's very, very low, at the moment, and, at times that difficult for you to tolerate, simply because of things that are going on for you, but also because, as a trainee counselor, you know we're all the same, we'd like to see results. So that's natural, that's understandable. So I guess it's sort of partly working between the tension of wanting to make progress, because we're working in an agency and expectations, but also, um, understanding people's processes and what you know, where they are in the moment. You know listening to your story, the thing that strikes me that's very positive, is that you said to me she doesn't feel negative as a mother, she's very positive as a mother. So, um, it's perhaps part of your task is being a able to, to sit with her, in feeling depressed and low, to tolerate that with her, because she feels perhaps very useless in the moment. But also, to be working with her in, in reinforcing the self-esteem, but where's she's still got that intact, which is in what she's doing as a mother, and how she's building that. Uh, and that, you know obviously you're going to have to see where you are at the end of the six sessions, but that, you know, her ego-strength isn't entirely depleted. She's- 

01:54:20
ELS VAN OOIJEN No, she is coping. I mean she's functioning. 

01:54:20
LESLEY SPENCER She is coping. But she's needing a safe place which you are giving her really well in order for her to be uh, at her lowest. Because where, where else can we take those things? So I don't want you ever to underestimate what you are offering her. 

01:54:40
ELS VAN OOIJEN Okay, that's really helpful. That's, that's helpful. Thank you.
