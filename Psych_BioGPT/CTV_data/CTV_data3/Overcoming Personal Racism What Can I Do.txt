MICROTRAINING ASSOCIATES (888)505-5576 www.emictrotraining.com The Psychology of Racism and Antiracism A Four Lecture Series by Derald Wing Sue, Ph.D Overcoming Personal Racism: What Can I Do? 

00:00:00
DERALD WING SUE  Okay, welcome to the third and four lecture series on the psychology of racism and antiracism. Ah, today's topic is overcoming personal racism, what can I do? Uhm, in 1997, this is something I shared with you earlier, in, in previous, uhm, ah, tapes. I was asked to testify before President Clinton's Race Advisory Board. During that period, three psychologists were invited to, ah, give their thoughts about, ah, racism and antiracism. Dr. James Jones started the entire, ah, presentation by talking about the historical embeddedness of racism in our society, ah, and historically, how it has influenced the, ah, our thoughts, and actions in this topic of biased and stereotyping. Dr. Jack Dovidio spoke next based upon his studies and research on the evolution of old-fashioned racism to, ah, contemporary forms of racism, that he felt was much more invisible and unintentional. My task, during that time, was to talk about what the average United States citizen could do to deal with overcoming and dealing with their own, uhm, racism and bias. One of the basic assumptions that I started out with, uhm, was precisely the fact that no one who is born in the United States, no one born in the United States, are free or immune from inheriting the racial biases of our forebearers. And this goes for every single group, regardless of race, culture and ethnicity. It is just impossible for any of us to be born here, raised here, culturally conditioned, educated and exposed to all of the issues, ah, and forces in our society, without inheriting biases, preconceived notions, stereotypes, ah, that affect our very, ah, basic action. It is very difficult for us to see our own biases, to see our prejudices, and to understand how we discriminate or oppress others, because of what I call ethnocentric monoculturalism. Ah, overcoming ethnocentric monoculturalism is indeed one of the major task that we, in this culture, need to do. And there are essentially five characteristics of, uhm, ethnocentric, uhm, uhm, monoculturalism. First, there is a strong belief in the superiority of one group's cultural heritage over another group. And I'm talking about, uhm, ah, language, uhm, ah, arts/crafts, ah, traditions, uhm, ah, the history and values of one particular group. Ah, these values, these, uhm, ah, you know, ah, ah, traditions, form the basic foundations of what I, ah, uhm, tend to call, ah, ethnocentric monoculturalism. These are things that are described positively, ah, and descriptors of, ah, advantage, much more civilized, uhm, tend to operate in the sense of superiority that goes with this, ah, particular definition. The second component of ethnocentric, ah, monoculturalism is that, there is a belief in the inferiority of all other group's cultural heritage; their language, their values, their customs, and their ways doing things. Uhm, other societies or groups, uhm, and particularly racial ethnic minority groups in this society, are often seen as, ah, less developed, uncivilized, and primitive. Ah, our ways of doing things are seen as inferior in one way or another. The third characteristic of ethnocentric monoculturalism is that, ah, the dominant group has the power to impose their standards upon the less powerful, uhm, ah, group. Now, this third component of power is the ultimate determination of when we begin to talk about oppression. All groups, whether Chinese, Japanese, Africans, Latin Americans, are ethnocentric to some respects. But it is the groups that have the power to impose their standards upon a less powerful group that begins to do the damage and relates very strongly, I think, to our, ah, topic of, of racism, ah, bias, and bigotry. The fourth characteristic is that, these ethnocentric values and beliefs are manifested in the programs, policies, practices structures of our institutions. They are not solely something that is conditioned within us. They permeate all of our society and as a result, they appear to be invisible. For example, our chain of command systems, our management systems, our performance appraisal systems, oftentimes achieve what I call "untouchable, godfather-like" status, ah, within an organization, in which all judgments, ah, are made. And when these, ah, policies and practices are monocultural in nature, they benefit one group, while disadvantaging, ah, ah, another group. The fifth component of ethnocentric monoculturalism is that, since all of us are products of our cultural conditioning, these values and beliefs, these worldview, is an invisible veil that prevents us from seeing how it affects our lives, how it is manifested in our actions, and how, in some sense, it may, ah, ah, place others at a disadvantage. They become so inculcated in us, that we believe, ah, they are universal that all people and groups operate in this way. And of course, if you have stuck with us in the first two, uhm, ah, video tapes, we know that different racial ethnic minority groups have different realities, and do not share in this universal, uhm, ah, assumption and belief. Now, it is very difficult for us to overcome personal racism unless we begin to look seriously at ethnocentric monoculturalism and how it affects us. It is very difficult, eh, often times when we try to push issues of bias, differences, and worldview, uhm, a stereotypes or, or the awareness of stereotypes, and the awareness of bias and, and racism into the mind of people, we get a whole host of emotional reactions. These emotive reactions I call, are so deeply embedded and nested in us, that they are very uncomfortable. So, when I pushed racism into minds of, of people, I have only found six types of the emotional responses, what I call emotional roadblocks to the path of multiculturalism and towards overcoming, uhm, ah, racism. One of the dominant feelings that people are likely to experience is the feeling of guilt. I feel guilty. When I pushed racism into the minds of people, guilt is often times, ah, manifested. It's almost like the person unconsciously or in private moments, realize, that they could be doing more. And as a result, they're hung up, or feel very, uhm, ah, uncomfortable and guilty in this way. A second type of the emotional reaction that often times comes out in many of us when we are looking at oppression and unfairness in our society is the feeling of anger. Ah, often times, when I do uhm, ah, racism and antiracism training, the audience or participants act with anger, ah, and often times, the anger is placed upon the fact that I, you know, I don't like to be seen as being wrong. And they strike out towards you, in terms of anger. And we'll come back to talk about this emotional feelings. The third one, ah, that often times occurs is the feeling of defensiveness. It's almost like the person is saying, why blame me? Uhm, I do enough already. Uhm, the fourth type of feeling, ah, that often times occurs within participants who undergo a racism awareness training workshop is they, they may say something, I feel turned off. I have other priorities in life. Uhm, you know, in some, in some sense, they are really turned off and disengaged from the issues, ah, and from exploring themselves as racial cultural beings. The fifth type of the emotional reaction that often comes out is I feel helpless. Many of my students when we be, ah, work in the racial cultural lab, have this reaction. The problem is so big, how can I, a single individual, do anything about it. I'm helpless, uhm, and this is again an emotional reaction that blocks our ability to effect change. The sixth one that often times occur is that, I feel afraid. Uhm, when you pushed racism into my mind and I understand disparities, I feel afraid, I feel that I'm going to lose something. Ah, among many white men is a fear that they will lose their jobs to people of color, which indeed is a myth in itself. But the fear, now these emotional reactions are so uncomfortable, no wonder we don't wanna think about bias, bigotry, racism; things that make us feel very uncomfortable, things that pushed buttons in us. All of these emotional reactions block our ability to explore ourselves as racial, uhm, ah, you know, cultural beings. I'd like to read to you, uhm, uhm, you know, this, uhm, a passage from Sarah(ph) Winter, a white woman, in an article she wrote on rooting out racism. This is an article that talks about the feelings and gives us some idea of the understanding about why confronting racism is so difficult and uncomfortable for many white folks. Ah, and she starts by saying, "All the White people I know deplore racism. We feel helpless about racial injustice in our society and we don't know what to do about the racism we sense in our own groups and lives. Persons of other races avoid our groups when they accurately sense the racism we don't see, just as gay spot heterosexism in straight groups and women see chauvinism among men. Few white people, like myself, socialize or work politically with people of other races, even when our goals are the same. We don't want to be racist so much of the time we go around trying not to be by pretending we're not. Yet white supremacy is basic in American social and economic history and there, these racist heritage has been internalized by American white people of all classes. We have all absorbed racism. Pretense and mystification only compound the problem. White readers, do you feel like turning to an article on some more pleasant topic? Paying attention to racism and race-related problems is very painful for me and other whites because we feel so helpless, guilty and defensive. Unfortunately, these feelings contribute to the problem. We are motivated to avoid the issues because we can feel less racism then. We avoid Black people because their presence brings painful questions to mind. Is it okay to talk about watermelon or mention black coffee? Should we use Black slang and retell racial jokes? How about talking about our experiences in Harlem? Or mentioning our Black lovers? Should we conceal the fact that our mother still employs a Mexican cleaning lady? We assume that the Black person is picking up on how racist or non-racist we are which is a projection of our own guilt. We're embarrassedly aware of trying to do our best, but to, at the same time, act natural. No wonder, we're more comfortable in all-white situations where these dilemmas don't arise. Whenever possible, we minimize our experience of racism by detonating our feelings. For example, watch the good deal of the recent Roots TV program series in a spirit of detached criticism. At one point on the second evening, I paid attention to my state, and realized I was experiencing the peculiar emotional deadness, which I have learned to recognize as a way I block out horrifying or disturbing race related materials. With this awareness, I cried as I watched. Then the detachment returned again. Through roots I had to fight to remain alive emotionally to see what I was seeing. My detachment is the mechanism, which allows us to live, allows me to live daily life, relatively unaffected, un-tormented by the racial injustice around me. Another example of minimizing racism is my tendency in life and in this article, to overlook race issues, regarding Spanish-speaking people, Asian people, and Native Americans. Not to mention anti-Semitism and stereotypes about national groups. Until about a year ago, for example, I conveniently hadn't noticed any evidence of Asian racism. The blinders began to come off when a Japanese American woman acquaintance of mine spoke to me about painful incidence of discrimination in her mainly white high school. I did not welcome becoming aware of that for her. Our relation of, ah, our relationship was tinge(ph) with associations, the pain of relating to white folks. I would certainly have preferred to stick with my prior perceptions that we were just persons. And that race didn't come in to our picture, in any important way. After all, I didn't mind the fact that she was Japanese. I have said that everyone has internalized racism in this racist society. My internalized racism is not my fault. I believe all of us took on racism against our wishes, through an impugning process that began when we were to young to recognize what was going on. Many of us can recall times that we notice evidence of racism and sense there was something wrong. I believe it hurts children to become aware of injustice and racial prosecution, especially when chaos, confusion, and dismay, is moved over by well-meaning adults themselves uncomfortable with facing their own racism. It hurts children to learn that one group of people are dirty and to be feared. As children we had no choice but to take places within the racism system, accepting it as, "Just the way things are." In this sense, we whites are also victims of racism. Our victimization is different from that of Blacks and other minorities, but it is real. We have been programmed into the oppressor roles we play without our informed consent in the process. Our unawareness is part of the programming. None of us could tolerate the oppressor roles or position, if we live with the day-to-day emotional awareness of the pain inflicted on other humans through the instruments of our behavior. However, it is obvious that in our position in the system, it is that of the oppressor one. We whites benefit in concrete ways, year in and year out, from the present racial arrangements. All my life in white neighborhoods, white schools, white jobs, and dealing with a white police, to name only a few, I have experienced advantages that are systematically not available to people of color. It does not make sense for me to blame myself for the advantages that have come my way by virtue of my whiteness. But absolving myself from guilt does not imply forgetting racial injustice or taking it lightly, as my guilt drives me to do. Whites who reap the undeserving benefits of racism are the ones capable of, and responsible, to change. Whites are also responsible for teaching other whites what to do. Now that I see what's going on, I'm not going to stop until racism ends." She asked in this paragraph as well, "White readers, how do you feel now? When someone pushes racism into my awareness, I feel guilty that I could be doing so much more. When someone plays, pushes racism into my mind, I feel angry, I don't like to feel that I'm in the wrong. When someone pushes racism into my awareness, I feel defensive. I already have two Black friends. What more can I do? When someone pushes racism into my mind, I feel turned off, because I have other priorities in life. Unfortunately, I feel guilty about that as well. When someone pushes racism into my mind, I feel helpless. The problem is so big, what can I do? I hate to feel that way. I hate this feeling. That is why I let race, race issues fade out of my awareness." Now, this, to me, really represents one of the most honest statements by a white, ah, sister, in terms of coming to grips with the meaning of her own bias discrimination and what makes it so difficult for white folks to look at themselves in an honest and direct manner. There are many barriers that prevent us from looking at ourselves honestly. One of them is that we were born and raised in this country, to believe in the equality, to believe in justice, to believe in respect for individuals and that is part of our self-image. When we begin to look at ourselves, and find that we violate those basic standards that we have been taught, those democratic ideals and principles, it is a very uncomfortable thing to realize that we maybe bigoted and racist, and this one of the primary barriers for us to deal with in racism. We find it very difficult, and avoid looking at ourselves as racial beings because it is very painful to realize that indeed, we may be racist. And, indeed, if we are racist, what does it mean for us in taking responsibility to rectify the situation? This is what makes it, uhm, ah, so difficult. Now, in the studies, uhm, during the testimony before, uhm, ah, Clinton's Race Advisory Board, I intended to outline two major areas that we have learned in the field of psychology of what creates an environment that tends to be less racist, less biased. And this can be talked about in terms of societal conditions that lead to an eradication of racism and personal things that we as individuals, uhm, ah, can do. Let me, first of all, talk about some of the, uhm, uhm, knowledge that we have acquired in social psychology, particularly, about what conditions lead to an amelioration of, uhm, ah, group hostility and conflict. There are essentially seven principles that if you go to social psychological literature, you can identify as principles that can be used to reduce, ah, or eradicate racism. Racism is most likely to diminish in the society if we can create these conditions; that people can have intimate contact with people different than yourself. Secondly, experience a cooperative rather than a competing environment. Third, our ability to work towards mutually shared goals, as opposed to individual ones. Fourth, to exchange accurate information, rather than stereotypes or misinformation about different racial ethnic groups. The fifth area is to be able to interact with one another on an equal footing, or what I call, an equal status relationship. The sixth one is to have our leadership, our authority figures supportive of inter-group harmony. And the last one, the seventh condition that we will talk about, is the ability to feel a unity and interconnectedness with one another. Let me, first of all, talk about this principles of societal, uhm, uhm, uhm, ah, you know, uhm, racism reduction. Principle one that I've mentioned before is to be able to have intimate and close contact with others. Now, one of the things that is clear is that, while many of us do have contact with people who are racially, gutturally, uhm, ah, different from one another and indeed in the work force, we work side by side, or go to school with people of, ah, of color. The truth is that these contacts tend to be superficial, and, ah, base department prescribed roles, rules and regulations that distances and keep us apart from one another. We maintain a social distance through prescribed roles that actually, ah, prevent us from getting to know one another on an intimate basis. For example, how many of us ask people of color into our homes to socialize, to dine with us? Or, ah, our, is our interactions, uhm, with them, confined primarily to the workplace where it is all task oriented rather than one that, ah, ah, allows us to do this. Now, let me give you an example of, uhm, this basic principle about having intimate contact with one another. Years ago when I joined, uhm, ah, the, ah, California State University of, ah, in Hayward, ah, one of my colleagues, Malachi Andrews, an African American professor, uhm, ah, knew that my work and research was in the area of multicultural psychology. And I recall specifically that he greeted me when, uhm, ah, I got there, and, ah, after awhile, after about the first two, ah, terms, he asked me to meet him for, ah, a beer, at the Local Lions, which was a restaurant down, uhm, ah, down the hill, ah, on the street. Now, I did not know, of course, I agreed to do it, uhm, ah, since we were good working colleagues, that I thought so, anyway, uhm, when I arrived at Lions into the cocktail bar, the thing that really struck me immediately was, my God, this entire, uhm, ah, ah, lounge area is a Black hang-out. Ah, there was not a single white person there. Uhm, there was a white bartender, along with an African American, ah, bartender. But when I went in there, I felt very uncomfortable, I didn't know what to do with my hands, I wanted to, ah, survey the place and find my colleague, Malachi, as soon as possible so that, at least there was someone to talk to and I wouldn't feel, ah, isolated. Indeed, what was happening was that, I was getting anxious. I was getting fearful. And you're talking of, ah, about someone who has written on multiculturalism, uhm, studies on African American psychology, Asian American psychology and I began to realize, I was anxious, but why was I anxious? Because I was operating under stereotypes and fears about what Black folks were like. So, uhm, I walked in, and one of things I immediately thought, uhm, that constantly echoed in my mind was I wonder if this group realizes, or notices, that I'm not Black. And the anxiety kept building and building, and I was about ready to, ah, leave when Malachi came in, and began to, ah, pull me over the table, introduced me to friends. And it took months and months of this type of contact before I've realize that I was, uhm, ah, being initiated into beginning to understand the cultural values and life experiences of a group, and much of my fears and apprehensions began to decline. Now, that's one of the basic issues, I think, we need to talk about very, uhm, ah, carefully. How do we initiate situations where we have contact, intimate contact, with one another? And we began to overcome this stereotype, these fears, these biases, uhm, ah, our negative feelings that we tend to have. Uhm, the second condition, and one thing that I'd like to, uhm, ah, talk about, ah, you know, before I get to the second principle, is that none of these principles alone is sufficient to eliminate or lower bias, bigotry and racism. They all have to exist at the same time. So, the previous principle, when I talked about contact, intimate contact, many of us know that intimate contact alone can also heighten antagonism and conflict. It is when these all operate, all of these principles are, are present. So, principle number two is important, that cooperation rather than competition. I think many of us realize that in our society, individual competition is deemed desirable and encouraged. Uhm, in fact, this goes back to our understanding that the psychosocial unit of operation in our society in the United States is the individual. Individualism and competition between individuals, is highly, uhm, ah, desired. The most, uhm, the most major and visible, uhm, ah, nature of success, is materialistic possessions or socioeconomic status. And, ah, it's really important for us to re, ah, realize that this competitives period, uhm, uhm, period, the competitive spirit and the win-lose mentality, tends to, in some sense, in our educational system, creates inter-group hostility, uhm, ah, and conflict. So that how do we begin to get Asian Americans, African Americans, White Americans, and, and so forth, to work in harmony and unison in a cooperative, rather than a competing, uhm, ah, manner. Principle number three that we have learned from studies is sharing mutual goals. It is clear that when we do not share the same goals, ah, the likelihood of having everyone work together in fruitful harmony, ah, is very difficult to do. So that antagonisms, along racial, ah, cultural ethnic lines, begin to, uhm, ah, exist. So, one of the things that our society has to begin to talk about are what are the mutual goals that are important for us to begin to share. Principle number four is exchanging accurate information. Most of our knowledge and beliefs about other racial ethnic groups do not come from experiential reality. It comes from what our family or friends say, and through the mass media, and through our educational, uhm, system. This information cannot often times be trusted to be accurate. Ah, yesterday, uhm, ah, while I was doing, ah, ah, speaking about some task, I tried to indicate that our socialization, the basis for our knowledge in this culture and society, comes to three different channels. Schooling and education, and I think, uhm, ah, is one channel that, that this occurs. The second channel is the mass media. What is portrayed in the mass media on ah, a very conscious and unconscious way, is soaked up by most people. And through, uhm, the third channel, is through personal and social groups. Uhm, let me, first of all, talk about the educational channel. If we study the history, the educational portrayal of racial ethna, ah, ethnic minorities in the United States, our social studies textbooks and history textbooks and all other educational material, tends to do one of two things. We are either neglected. Ah, when I went to school, I often times felt that a part of me was missing. Especially when we would study Western Civilization to the exclusion of, of other civilizations, nor other racial, uhm, ethnic groups. Ah, we seldom talked about Chinese Americans, Asian Americans. We seldom talked about the contributions of the Chinese, the building of the transcontinental railroad, the mining of gold, ah, the Japanese, uhm, ah, influence in agriculture. So that going to school, this was absent from the material I read, and so I felt this part of me missing. Ah, yet, when I was portrayed, when my people were portrayed, it was either in stereotypes, or we were seen as aliens. For example, the only time that the teacher would begin to talk about Chinese, uhm, ah, in any sense which when we studied the unit of Chi, in China. And my teacher would often times when we're doing this, turn to me and say, "Derald, so what do you people do when you ah, celebrate this ho, holiday?" And I would respond by saying, "I don't know." And it was a humiliating ah, experience because there were several things going on, I felt that may be I should know. But at the same time, what was communicated to me was that I am still an alien in my own country. I am not a US citizen. I am an Asian from Asia, not an Asian American. And so, these are the things in education that, uhm, ah, that, that ah, distorts thing. To be to, ah, and, uhm, Native American, and to be told that Columbus discovered America ah, many of us know that American Indians often times would ask, "Well, I was never lost, how could I be discovered? I knew where, where I was." And in essence, what we know was that Columbus was lost. He just thought he had discovered the continent of India, that's why the name Indians ah, rose. And it is a very damaging thing when you are fed this ethnocentric perspective, based upon, uhm, ah, rigid stereotypes. The mass media, also portrays racial, ethnic minorities as, and I'm talking about, uhm, uhm, movies ah, TV, uhm, reading magazines, books and so forth, uhm, often times, we are portrayed very negatively, we're, the, the, portrayed us being pathological, deviant, criminals, uncivilized, uncouth and so forth. In a recent study, I'd like to read to you that was done ah, with respect to ah, a survey on the mass media, the portrayal of racial ethnic minorities, they concluded this, that regardless of race, all children were more likely to associate, uhm, in the media, positive qualities with white characters. They were more likely seen as having more money, more well-educated, were leaders, they do well in school and ah, ah, are indeed, intelligent. With respect to, uhm, racial ethnic minorities, it was negative qualities; they break the law, or poor and lazy and so forth. Whites and African-American say that they see co, people of their race on television, while Latinos and Asians are much le, less likely to see numbers of their own race. When I came from ah, when I came to New York, one of the things that struck me, a newscast, with the absence of Asian American newscasters and this was something very, uhm, ah, ah, different in the San Francisco bay area where ah, Asians were frequently, uhm, on there. So that, one of the things was that, children tend to think that whites usually play the roles of boss, secretary, police officer and doctor in television, whereas African Americans play criminals, maid and janitor. Across all races, children agree that news media, portray African Americans and Latino people, more negatively, than Whites and Asians particularly when the news is about young, uhm, ah, people. Ah, I could go on, and, and talk about these, uhm, ah, areas to you, but it is clear to me that the mass media ah, inculcates and socializes much of our knowledge base and beliefs about racial ethnic issues. Peers and social groups also serve a major how our parents raised us, what our neighbors communicate to us. Let me read to you, again, uhm, another section of this that will bring home about how parents unconsciously and unintentionally will communicate something to their children. "It was a late summer afternoon, a group of white neighborhood mothers, obviously friends had brought their four and five-year-olds to the local McDonald's for a snack, and to play on the swings and slides provided by the restaurant. They were all seated at a table, watching their sons and daughters runabout and play, the play area. In one corner of the yard sat a small Black child, pushing a red truck along the grass. One of the white girls from the group approached the Black boy and they started a conversation. During that instant, the mother of the girl exchanged quick glances with the other mo, mothers who nodded knowingly. The mother quickly arose from the table, walked over to the two, spoke to her daughter, and gently pulled her away to join her previous playmates. Within minutes, however, the girl, again, approached the Black boy, and both began to play with the truck. At that point, all the mothers rose from the table and loudly exclaimed to their children, "It's time to go now!" Now, you, this is one of the most powerful means by which we, as parents, ah, communicate bias, uhm, ah, to our children. And no wonder, when we think that from the moment of birth, we are impacted by all of these images, we begin to realize that how strong the cultural conditioning is. Now, if we go to principle number ah, five, which I called uhm, a sharing and equal status relationship, the majority of contacts between majority group members and minority group members, are froth with inequality. I think that most of us realize that this is true, and this power imbalance represents a major barrier, uhm, to our ability to overcome bias and racism. Uhm, many groups do not wanna give up that power, liked the thought of being in ad, ah, advantage position. So that if we create, how do we, a society, create an equal status relationship, is really an effort. You cannot, uhm, ah, eradicate racism by putting a C, white CEO with a Black Latino ah, ah, custodian, in order to try to, uhm, discom, uhm, because the status relationship is to desperate(ph). Uhm, the principle number six, is that we support racial, uhm, ah, e, racial equity must be supported by leaders, by uhm, ah, groups in, in authority. When school desegregation occurred in the South, uhm, the attempt to desegregate, uhm, ah, a school, that was successful if the superintendent, the governor, community leaders, were in support of it. If indeed the governor, or the superintendent, says that that's the law, I don't believe in it, but we're going to have to, uhm, uhm, ah, desegregate our, our schools, it was unsuccessful generally, and arouse greater conflict, so that we need to begin to look to our leadership, in terms of what it is that is required in order to eradicate ah, or, or reduce racism. And the last principle that we have learned from social psychological studies is a feeling of connectedness, and experiencing a sense of belonging, that in some sense, we need to feel close to one another. We cannot separate ourselves ah, ah, in terms of saying, uhm, ah, that, that's a, uhm, ah, lower form or worse, and which we go out to kill people, we have dehumanized them, and what we have to do as a society is get back to the uhm, ah, issue that if we hurt someone else, we hurt ourselves. We need to begin to move towards, uhm, ah, this feeling of being, uhm, ah, interconnected, uhm, ah, with one another. Now, having given you a number of, uhm, these ideas, of, of principles, of what society needs to move towards, and what all of us need to do. What can we individually do, on a much more individual level in order to personally overcome a bias in racism, and now I will share with you some of the, uhm, ah, thoughts that I have, in terms of, of the work that I have done, both with the American Psychological Association and, ah, during my testimony before Clinton's race advisory board. There are five basic principles that all of us need to begin to exercise to overcome personal, uhm, racism. Principle one, number one says that we learn about people of color from sources within that group. Now, uhm, first, what I'm saying is that, you must experience and learn from many sources as possible, not just as I've said, the media, uhm, the educational system, what our friends, family, neighbors say to us, but we have to check out the validity of our knowledge and our assumptions, actually when e, experiencing ah, interactions with, uhm, ah, people of color, and one of the things that we know that is basic to this principle is a question that I can ask you, uhm, ah, ah, strongly. If you want to understand sexism, do you ask men or women? If you want to understand homophobia, do you ask straights or gays, and finally if you want to understand what racism is all about, and what people of color are all about, do you ask White folks or people of color? I think it's clear to me that the greatest sources of accuracy has to come from the, uhm, ah, group itself. Now principle number two. Ah, ah, a personal, uhm, ah, principle is that we need to learn from healthy and strong people of the culture. As a psychologist, and then working with many of, of our students, you know, in psychology, we tend to see only pathology, unfortunately in terms of a work being a counseling, psychologist doing clinical work, we see pathology and that's an unbalanced picture. A balance picture of racial ethnic minority groups requires that you spend time with strong and healthy people of that culture. The mass media and our educational texts as I've, uhm, said before, frequently portray minority groups as uncivilized, pathological criminals, and, and delinquents. You must make an effort to fight such negative conditioning and ask yourselves what are the desirable aspects of the culture, the history of the people. Ah, this can only come about if you have contact with healthy representatives of the group. Since you seldom spend time ah, or intimate time with persons of color, you're unlikely to believe uhm, ah, or break apart from many of these, uhm, uhm, you know, ah, biases, that you have. So overcoming, let me give you a few examples about what you can do. It's much harder than, ah, I'm going to outline here. I think one of things is to frequent minority owned businesses and get to know the proprietors. Attend services at a variety of churches, synagogues, temples, and other places of worship to learn about different faiths and meet church leaders. Invite colleagues, coworkers, neighbors, or students of color to your home for dinner or for a holiday. Live in an integrated or culturally diverse neighborhood and attend neighborhood organizational meetings and, or attend block parties. Now, this is something ah, I'd like to just briefly pause and talk about, now, living in integrated and culturally, ah, ah, diverse neighborhood. Columbia University, the place when I, uhm, ah, work in, especially Teachers College, is theoretically located in Harlem. Ah, even though we call it Morningside Heights, uhm, it is, resides in Harlem, and Columbia University is expanding into ah, Ha, Harlem. Some of the less expensive, uhm, ah, apartments and homes can be, in, in, uhm, the city of Manhattan is found in Harlem. Ah, in one of my workshops that I was doing, when I was saying to live in an integrated, uhm, neighborhoods, one of the white students who lived in an apartment in, uhm, ah, in Harlem, ah, felt very good about her ability, to, uhm, uhm, you know, to implement this principle, until I begin to talk to her that live, living in Harlem is different from how you live in Harlem. For example, what I'm saying to her and talked to her about was, "Do you interact with people in the community?" or "Do you go back from school, only to lock yourself in your apartment to go only to certain, uhm, ah, grocery stores?" (inaudible ) you know, and I think that that's the issue here. Do you simply live in Harlem, or is how you live in Harlem and integrated multicultural, uhm, ah, experience. Another ah, suggestion is to form community organizations on valuing diversity and invite local artists, authors, entertainers, politicians, and leaders of color to address your group. Attend street fairs, educational forums, and events put on by the uhm, ah, community. Now principle number three, ah, something that I've consistently emphasized is to learn from experiential reality. While readings, attending theater, going to museums are helpful in increasing your, uhm, understanding, you must supplement your factual understanding with the experiential reality of the groups you hope to understand. These experiences must be something, however, that is carefully planned. You have to force yourself to, in, uhm, interact with others, and one of the suggestions I have, is that perhaps you should identify a cultural guide, someone from the culture who is willing to help you understand his or her group, (clears throat) someone willing to introduce you to new experiences, someone willing to help you process your thoughts, feelings and behaviors. Now principle number four learn from constant vigilance of your biases and fears. As a person of color, I am never given an opportunity not to deal with issues of race and racism, and I ask you to be constantly vigilant to your own feelings ah, as well. For example, as you pass people of color, do you find yourself suddenly clutching your purse more tightly or checking your wallet? Or do you cross the street to avoid passing them? When you as a woman, get into an elevator with a black man, do you have apprehensions and fears? Oftentimes, paying attention to these reactions and fears will let you begin to uncover the biases and fears that you have. Ah, principle number five is to learn from being committed to personal action against racism. Dealing with racism means a personal commitment to action. It means interrupting other white Americans when they make racist jokes, uhm, or engage in racist actions, even if it is embarrassing or frightening. It means noticing the possibility for direct action against bias in family, work and your community. It means taking the initiative to vote for minority candidates or other candidates who stand for uhm, a social justice and equity. Now, uhm, I understand that our time is, uhm, ah, nearing its end, but I wanna share with you what APA has come out with, in terms of some, uhm, ah, items about ah, suggestions of overcoming, uhm, your own biases. First, to be honest. You must develop an ability to recognize, as I've said, your own biases and to be honest and non-defensive about exploring what is going on. You must be, secondly, be a partner. Volunteer to work on projects with groups different than your own. It's been found that working alongside in a cooperative way with people of color does more to eradicate and eliminate biases and misinformation. As I've indicated, uhm, ah, suggestion number three, is to be an anti-racist parent. Uhm, you must begin to raise your children to understand concepts like prejudice, discrimination and racism, and you must be active in terms of doing this. Fourth, be a role model. Whether you want to or not, parents serve as role models and, uhm, ah, in any environment that you are, whether you're a student, whether you're a CEO, whether you're a teacher, you serve as a role model. How you deal with issues of race and racism, ah, is communicated to all those around you. So, ah, ah, begin to think. Be an ally. You must reach out and become an ally of persons of color. Support victims of discrimination. Be willing to join them in advocating for fair treatment and so forth. Six, be an activist. When you see racial injustice, speak out and object. Be willing to challenge your family, I know it's difficult, friends and neighbors when they make racial jokes, slurs, or act in ways that indicate bias. Bring this to your church, your community, to your workplace as well, in terms of being an activist. Be a member. Are you a member of the numerous organizations that stand for social justice and anti-discrimination? And I'm encouraging you to join groups that, uhm, work towards equal access and opportunities, social justice, anti-discrimination and anti-racism. For example, how many of you are members of the Anti-Defamation League, The Human Rights Campaign? The National, Associa, uhm, Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, The National Council of La Raza, The National Organization for Women, or the pov, Southern Poverty Law Center? There are many organizations that we become, uhm, can become a member of, and support in terms of dealing with this. Be a teacher. As a co-worker, parent, neighbor, or teacher, you can teach others to value diversity and multiculturalism. Nine, be a student. You must realize, as I have, that, uhm, anti-racism education is a constant, lifelong, ongoing process. You must educate yourselves and others on a continuing and ongoing basis. And lastly, be secure. Don't be as, afraid or ashamed of your cultural heritage. However, it means how, uhm, recognizing both positive and negative aspects of your group. Know your strengths of, uhm, ah, strengths and limitations, and most of all, understand yourself as a racial-cultural being. I truly believe that while we may never be able to completely eradicate bias and racism, all of us, if we join hands and work actively to, uhm, ah, overcome personal racism and racism in our society. This holds, uhm, abodes(ph) well for our future. And like I was saying here, ah, what we to today, ah, what we make a commitment to, will either, uhm, ah, be, what our society will move forward to in a positive way or may mean the end of our society as we would like it to be. So thank you very much and I look forward to the, uhm, ah, last lecture, ah, that will be coming up. Thank you.
