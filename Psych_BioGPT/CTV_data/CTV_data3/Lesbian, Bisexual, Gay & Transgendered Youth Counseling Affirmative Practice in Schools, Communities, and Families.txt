These are demonstration videotapes made with actors) Adam L. Benson Jerry Hsieh Kate Howell Krispin Matthew Lisa Nagle Nelson Medina Theresa Wyre Michael W. Ryan INTRODUCTION 

00:00:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES I am Stuart Chen-Hayes. I am an assistant professor of Counseling in a graduate program at the City University of New York, Lehman College. 

00:00:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Hi and welcome. I am Dr. Lynn Haley-Banez. I'm an assistant professor here at Fairfield University and the Director of Clinical Training, as well as the Coordinator of the Community Counseling Program. And between the two of us, Stuart and I have had numerous years of experience of counseling and working with gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender youth in, ah, community settings, school settings, family, individual, ah, counseling. 

00:01:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES We are happy to bring you Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, Transgender Youth and Family Counseling 101 today. What you will be seeing after our introduction are a, a series of specific awareness and knowledge pieces to help you as a professional counselor, or, or other mental health professional, or performativity with lesbian, bisexual, gay, and transgendered youth and families, in school and/or agency settings. We have a series of things that we'd like to accomplish with this video, and our most important goal is to help you develop affirmative, culturally-competent skills in working with lesbian, bisexual, gay, transgender youth and families. Our outline of the video includes a series of definitions followed by pieces of helpful, affirmative language, what to do to challenge myths and stereotypes about lesbian, bisexual, gay, and transgendered persons, a series of frequently asked questions about affirmative sexual orientation and gender identity counseling, a list of print and internet resources, followed by, we will give you a developmentally affirming lesbian, bisexual, gay, and transgender identity development model, and last, we will have six, short, specific vignettes that illustrate each of the stages of that model. 

00:02:30
LBGT COUNSELING DEFINITIONS 

00:02:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES For affirm-- affirmative counseling with lesbian, bisexual, gay, and transgender persons and family members in schools and agencies, it's important to be clear and precise about the terms that we want to use. 

00:02:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ I think it's important to convey when you're working with gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender youth, and understanding of what, just even the basic definition of sexual orientation is, that we all are born with, have a sexual orientation and sexual identity that falls on the continuum anywhere from heterosexual, to gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or any point in between on that continuum. 

00:03:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Thank you, Lynn. I would also add to that, that sexual orientation is a multivariable, dynamic process. Uhm, people often think that sexual orientation is merely whom people have sex with, and that's ah, a small part. Sexual orientation includes who people are attracted to, it includes people's social preference of whom they wanna be around in terms of gender, it includes person's attractions, it includes person's, uhm, interests in terms of the labels that they use for themselves, do they identify as lesbian, heterosexual, bisexual, uhm, gay? Ah, it includes, uhm, who people are interested in romantically. Uhm, it's also important to look at who people's fantasies are about. Sexual orientation is the capacity to be attracted to people. It doesn't mean that people necessarily act out on it and it is fluid over time. Ah, while research would indicate that most people are set in their sexual orientation over time, we know that there are substantial numbers of people who may shift, ah, in terms of that. All right. The second major area of definition, in addition to sexual orientation, is I'll refer to as gender identity. Gender identity is a person's experience of their gender in terms of what we're, ah, talk about as masculinity and or femininity, and it's an internal experience. So, part of what we have to look at is the concept of gender is socially constructed and socially defined, and how we feel, how we experience ourselves as men, or as women, as boys, or as girls, or as someone in between, uhm, is what gender identity is all about. Uhm, within gender identity, there are series of terms that we, ah, affirmatively ref-- to, refer to, as the gender community. So, transgender persons, the term transgender is really a broad umbrella term for all sorts of people within the gender identity community, and folks include transsexuals. Transsexuals are persons who, uhm, have ah, an internal gender identity that may not necessarily match the external biology of the given sex that the person has. Uhm, cross-dressers are persons who are primarily heterosexual men and they are interested in or attracted to wearing women's clothing. Ah, drag queens and drag kings are persons who are usually lesbian or gay and are, ah, interested in wearing clothes of the opposite gender as a way to, ah, have fun, it's a way to be political, to make a statement. There are a variety of, ah, reasons behind doing drag. Inter-sex persons are persons who have been born, ah, with a, a combination of male and female genitalia and, ah, may go through life, ah, having the chance to be able to self-define in terms of who they are. Do they identify as androgynous, more as a male and more as a female? And last but not least are who we refer to as gender-blenders. Gender-blenders are persons who choose to wear or identify externally as a combination of male and female. 

00:06:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ The next definition that I, I want to talk about is, uhm, essentialism versus social constructionism, and the reason I wanna talk about that is Stuart alluded to it earlier in his definition of gender identity, and that it's socially constructed for the most part. For a long time, we've lived as essentialists, or a believer in a single truth statement. Therefore, heterosexuality was the norm and anything that fell outside of that norm was abnormal and or deviant. Uhm, as we're looking at affirming, ah, counseling with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth, I think it's important to remember there is another perspective and that is, ah, how all of this is socially constructed and that social construction allows for, ah, a multiple, ah, positions, multiple truth statements. There is no one right or wrong. Therefore, just because one is gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender, it doesn't mean they're outside of their norm. It's just a different place on the sexual identity continuum. Uhm, it was ah, originally constructed in the late 1900s. Uhm, it was constructed to label and identify a particular group of people, a particular, ah, gay, gay people, ah, the term that they came up with was "homosexuality" and it was used to oppress that group of people. Ah, so they needed to label in order to corral people around and then, ah, oppress them. Social constructionism allows us to broaden that box and say, well, there are many different people on this continuum, neither one is right, wrong, better or worse than. 

00:08:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. And so, looking at issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, it's critical that we also talk about gender role and gender. Gender is, again, socially constructed. It's what societies, ah, tell people to do in terms of how they express their being male, being female, and it varies widely around the world and across cultures. There is no one way to be a gendered person. Certain cultures have tried to say, women are all like this and men are all like this, but the reality is that there's tremendous and great difference within and around cultures around the world. And so, gender is the social construction of how people say, these are the roles that people need to play, as what it means in male or female, or boys or girls, men or women, and folks in between. Ah, gender role then is how people in their day-to-day lives, in their interactions, uhm, construct and work with what it means to be a gendered being. So there's lots of variability, there's a lot of potential for flexibility. But in certain cultures, it's very rigid and if you step out of what it means to be a traditional man or a traditional woman, traditional boy or traditional girl, uhm, a lot of stress and a lot things can occur. 

00:09:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:09:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right. Ah, next, Lynn will talk about the concept of heterosexism, internalized and externalized, and then I'll talk about transgenderism, also internalized and externalized. 

00:09:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay. Heterosexism, uhm, I think people often confuse with homophobia, and homophobia as, as most folks know is the irrational fear of, ah, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered people. Heterosexism is a different concept. Heterosexism is the oppression of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered people. It is prejudice times a power, uhm, that heterosexual people have and then imposed upon, so that would be external, ah, ah, heterosexism, when it's opposed upon. If I cannot, uhm, get married, for example, that would be societal support of heterosexism, not homophobia, but heterosexism. Internalized heterosexism will be I would have integrated all of those negative statements that I have heard about what it is to be a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgendered - 

00:10:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:10:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - as an individual, and I respond to heterosexism perhaps in a fear mode. I don't know what to do or I believe those statements to be true so I punish myself in some way or I don't allow myself to be who I truly am, uhm, without a great deal of angst. And sometimes in, uhm, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered youth, it is that expression of the internalized oppression where we see certain acting-out behaviors as we've, and have described or labeled, acting-out behaviors within that population. 

00:11:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Transgenderism then, is prejudice multiplied by power, used by persons who are traditionally-gendered to keep away access to resources to people who are non-traditionally gendered and there are lots of examples of that. Externalized transgenderism then, uhm, is what occurs from people who are traditionally gendered to try to keep people in traditional gender roles. So, for example, a transgendered youth who wants to come out of the closet as being a gender identity other than what traditionally, say, the body they were born into, uhm, is, ah, targeted for violence, for discrimination, for hatred within say, a school or family setting. Uhm, and so, externalized transgenderism is trying to keep people with non-traditional gender identities in their place. Internalized transgenderism then for us as counselors, like internalized heterosexism, is where we wanna spend a lot of time working with clients. Uhm, internalized transgenderism is when I feel there's something wrong with me or I'm not okay, or I start to believe the myths and stereotypes about all transgendered people are this way, or cross-dressers have problems, and I don't wanna be around any of them, uhm, and, ah, so there's a lot of work for us to do to help clients to look at how to empower themselves and challenge the power, that is oppression, called transgenderism. All right. Next, Lynn will talk about, ah, what it means to be a heterosexual and or traditionally gendered ally, and that I will end with talking about coming out. 

00:12:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay. Given, ah, the last two definitions that Stuart and I talked about, one of the things that's important to remember is in order for us to provide affirming ah, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered, ah, counseling, affirming and, I should say, also effective counseling, is that we need allies. Allies would be those people who do not necessarily define themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, but who are, what we have it, I guess traditionally in our society called heterosexual people as the norm, those folks entering into our lives as supporters, affirmers - 

00:13:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:13:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - ah, people who, ah, can interact with our community, ah, understand who we are as individuals as well as couples, families, and communities so that we can bridge the gap and there's a broader pool of us than, ah, working, uhm, for example, to help, uhm, a, a gay youth who has come into my office, ah, saying that they, they need something. What can I establish in terms of their community support and network that isn't just made up of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered folks? Yes, that's important. It's also important to have the broader pool, those heterosexual people who are comfortable and supportive, and affirming of those people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender. 

00:14:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. All right. And last, we need to talk about coming out. Coming out is a process that lesbian, bisexual, gay, and transgendered persons, ah, do, ah, for our entire lives in terms of talking about who we are and learning to negotiate where is it safe to be who we are, or where is it important that we not talk about who we are because we might be violated or oppressed. Ah, and it's also a process that is culturally-relative and what I mean by that is that not all lesbian, bisexual, gay, and transgendered persons, uhm, will come out or is it safe or appropriate for folks to come out. It's a very important for counselors to know that it is never the counselor or mental health professional's job to order or insist on someone to come out of the closet. People can, ah, make their decisions over time who they choose to be out with, who not. In many communities of color around the world, ah, and in certain White and the Jewish communities, it's simply not safe for people to come out, ah, and so coming out is a personalized process, it's also a political process. People need to learn how to do that within, they come out to themselves, and then be able to make choices about how and where and if they choose to be out to others. 

00:15:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ And I would just like to add one other, ah, piece to the, that the coming-out process in that once one person-- once you come out to yourself as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, ah, that process never stops. You are constantly - 

00:15:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:15:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - making decisions - 

00:15:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:15:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - even in a split second, in a, in a moment, the minute you run into somebody else. Do I come out? Don't I come out? Do I just tell them who I am? Don't I tell them who they, who I am? Do I tell them that I have a family or do I tell them that I have a partner or do I make that up? So, it's an ongoing process. 

00:16:05
LBGT COUNSELING AFFIRMATIVE LANGUAGE 

00:16:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ One of the things that's really important in, uhm, providing affirmative, effective counseling to a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered youth is the concept of language, how we use language. So, Stuart and I would like to take a few minutes to go over, ah, the use of affirmative language, ah, versus that, those, uhm, words or the, how we use language that may be less affirming. 

00:16:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Then, the term homosexuality was defined by the medical community, and it is seen as an oppressive practice in lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered communities. We have asked to be called lesbian, bisexual, gay, and transgendered. Those are terms that we have developed that we want to have used, ah, and so, we ask that people not to use the term homosexuality because we see it as pathologizing us, ah, and the negative connotations with that. 

00:17:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay, thank you Stuart. The, ah, next word is also that is of sexual preference versus sexual orientation or sexual identity, and again, sexual preference, ah, connotes that one has a choice. I can choose to be gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered, and it's not a choice. So, to use instead of sexual preference, sexual orientation or sexual identity. Stuart? 

00:17:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uhm, another area that we have to look at is that the language that we're using to describe lesbian, bisexual, gay, transgender persons and issues is English and not all people around the world or in all cultures use the terms lesbian, bisexual, gay, and or transgendered. And so, terms like true spirit, which comes from indigenous communities, ah, and it's important that many people who are in love, and or attracted to people of the same gender, may not use the terms at all. So, some people would say, men who love men, women who love women, ah, things like that. So, it's important that we not assume simply because we have those categories that they are universal enough. 

00:18:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Another, ah, language issue that's important to address is that of inclusive language. How can I use my language so that it includes a broader pool of people in an affirming way? So, instead of saying, ah, for example, uhm, you know, are you married or a couple, you may asks somebody about their relationship status, uhm, previous relationships, that allows them to, uhm, if you will, kind of move about the cabin a little bit more freely, in terms of identifying - 

00:18:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:18:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - who they've had relationships with, who they are in a relationship with, or who they may choose to be in a relationship later on in, in life. As well as the, allowing them to define, uhm, who their family is, if they have a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgendered family and what that family is made up of. Ah, so it doesn't pin one down into, if I'd say, uhm, are you married, single, widowed, or divorced, which we often see on, you know, lots of forms - 

00:19:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:19:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - it doesn't really give, ah, people ah, an opportunity to adequately express who they are. 

00:19:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES And the last pointer on language is how to use gender and gender pronouns effectively to persons who are in the transgendered community. So, for persons who are transgendered and are gender variant, it's important that we use the gender pronoun of how the person is presenting themselves externally when we work with someone. So, for example, I'm working with a transgendered youth and that person is coming in to my office and they are dressed as female, I definitely want to use pronouns like she. If the person is dressed as male, I want to use male pronouns like he. And if ever get stuck or I'm not sure, and you're not sure, as the counselor or the mental health professional, uhm, ask the client. Ask, "How would you prefer that I refer to you in this session or at this time in terms of gender?" It's very honoring. Ah, one of the things that Lynn and I both would say over and over about doing affirmative work in gender identity or sexual orientation counseling is never assume, always ask. 

00:20:15
LBGT COUNSELING MYTHS AND STEREOTYPES 

00:20:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES We'd now like you to refer to a series of slides and a leader guide in terms of the next several sections that we'd like to cover. The first are a series of myths and stereotypes related to working with lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender, ah, youth and families. And so, one of the things that we hope to accomplish with this is to have dialogue around the most common misperceptions and the things that really get professional counselors, parents, teachers, family members stuck, ah, around working affirmatively with lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender youth. 

00:20:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. While there are many myths and stereotypes about gay, lesbian and bisexual, ah, youth and/or persons, ah, one of the, ah, most salient ones for me, ah, is the whole notion that we don't belong in schools because we were either hurt their children in some way or recruit them to be gay or we will, uhm, be predators upon them i-- in some way. So, so, in some way we're gonna be hurtful to them. And I think that, in and of itself, ah, stops us from being affirmative, ah, counselors to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth because we move from our own fear, ah, component that says, "I cannot raise this as an issue. I will have an angry parent or have an angry administrator. I will have a whole group of people that will, ah, move upon me from a fear perspective. I've internalized to that fear, whether I'm gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender myself and or just an affirming ally and that shuts me down." And that's not true at all. 

00:22:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:22:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ We are not predators. We do not actively recruit people to be gay, uhm, again, it's not a choice. It's, ah, it's simply who people are and, uhm, we're just here to help them facilitate their own growth and development in a healthy way, ah, versus ending up on the street or dead. 

00:22:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:22:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Stuart? 

00:22:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Excellent. Uhm, the second area and, you'll see on the slide, we have multiple numbers and then the leader guide of the different myths and stereotypes. The second one that we felt was the most important in schools is the idea of somehow, someone being lesbian, bisexual, gay or transgendered as being just a phase. And this is an incredible myth and stereotype. 

00:22:40
LBGT COUNSELING FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

00:22:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES In these technologically advanced times, we figured that we should include a section of frequently asked questions, ah, in our teaching today. And part of what we want to do is as you go through you'll see the slide and, ah, refer to the leader guide 'cuz there are many, many frequently asked questions about these issues that we simply don't have time to address on tape. Lynn and I discussed the two that we felt most passionate about for people be affirmative to do this work in schools, ah, and in families. And so, the first issue that, ah, we wanna talk about, the first question is: "How do I help a client or a teacher or parent reconcile their religious beliefs, ah, around sexual orientation and gender identity issues, particularly if their religion is bigoted toward lesbian, bisexual, gay and the transgendered persons?" And, ah, our response to that would be that it's really important to validate that people may disagree about sex orientation or gender identity, ah, and, ah, well, for myself as an undergraduate in comparative world religions, part of what I talk about is how religion is interpreted varies dramatically both within and across religious and spiritual identities. And what's important for us in schools and in family agencies is to be respectful and affirming with all people. We could certainly choose to disagree, uhm, and at the same time I encourage people to go find people within their faith-based community who are supporter of lesbian, bisexual, gay, and transgendered persons because even in the most of conservative religious and spiritual backgrounds, there are always affirming people who are available. And that's the way to do that work. 

00:24:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. And for me, one of the questions that I often get is, " How then do I make my office in school or community, uhm, how do I make my office more affirming? How do I let students know that I'm a safe person and an affirming person to come to, and or other, ah, professionals in my school?" Uhm, one way that I'd suggest, ah, people can do that is to have their office, ah, be, ah, multiculturally inclusive. Now, earlier we talked about inclusive language. Now, I'm talking about inclusive items that you might have out, uhm, on your, on your desk, posters you might have on your wall, ah, books you may have on your bookshelf, make sure they include those things that would be affirming of, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people. You know what, ah, magazines they read, have them available in your waiting room or in your, you know, the office space outside your, uhm, smaller office where you, where you, be, ah, alone with students, ah, as well as have those resources inside your office so, you know, as students come in, they look around your office. They get a feel for who you are and one way to get a feel for who you are is they look at what literature is here, what books are here, what magazines are here. You might have a rainbow flag, which is, ah, a symbol of, uhm, gay pride, as well as a pink triangle or a black triangle. Ah, there are so many other, ah, symbols and I would encourage you to go out and, ah, resource those for yourself. But those are certainly some ideas that you can, ah, put into place almost immediately - 

00:26:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm, Uh-hmm. 

00:26:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - ah, in your office and, you know, to broaden it, there also include other, you know, cultures, and just, make your office as diverse and as inclusive as possible. And that's a non-verbal way of communicating, this is a safe place. 

00:26:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:26:15
LBGT COUNSELING IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT 

00:26:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Now that we've done a series of ah, specifics around lesbian, bisexual, gay, and transgender affirming awareness and knowledge related to language, to definitions, to frequently asked questions, what we want to move toward now, ah, is looking at a specific affirmative identity development model. Professor Anthony D'Augelli at Pennsylvania State University developed a model in the mid-1990s to work affirmatively with lesbian, bisexual and gay persons. Lynn and I have modified the model adding transgendered persons as well. It's a series of six stages, we will give an example of each of the stages and then the six vignettes will immediately follow to give you an example of how to do affirmative counseling within each of those vignettes. The first stage is, "Exiting Heterosexual and Traditional Gender Identity." And an example of this is that, ah, most of us are born in a world where we're assumed that we're heterosexual and or we're of traditional gender identity. And so, part of what youth and adults need to do is to, uhm, go through a grieving period to say goodbye to what it means to be a traditional heterosexual or, or gender-identified. And so, for example, in a school, what we may have, uhm, as a youth that comes out of the closet and says, "I'm a lesbian. Here I am, uhm, deal with me. Deal with it." And the second part of the model is developing a personal or internal lesbian, bisex-- lesbian, bisexual, gay and or transgender identity. And what this is about, uhm, is for folks to be able to say, "All right. This is who I am. I am lesbian, or bisexual, or gay, or transgendered. This is what it means to me and this is how my whole life is going to be different based on and this is my identity." So, to working on the tasks and developing what it means to be good, what it means to feel good about being lesbian, bisexual, gay and or transgendered. So, let's say, "I feel good about who I am. And now I'm thinking about, gosh, if this is who I am, I need to go out and find some other people who will affirm, teachers or parents or, or peers, who I am as a lesbian, bisexual, gay and or transgendered person." The third area of the model is developing a social identity. And so, this is the external process. This is saying, "All right, I'm not clear about who I am, if lesbian, bisexual, gay and or transgendered. And I feel good about it, uhm, and gosh, you know, I'm really interested in maybe joining a club, maybe developing a, uhm, a lesbian and gay, bisexual, transgender alliance at our school, in order to find other people, other peers, or maybe I'll go on the internet so that I can, ah, go to a chat room and find other teens or other youths who are there, who are affirming and able to say, 'Yes, externally, we are lesbian, bisexual, gay and or transgendered." The next area of the model is, developing, ah, excuse me, is becoming, a, a lesbian, bisexual, gay and or transgendered offspring. And what this means is, again, we're all in the family context and when an individual youth and or adult says, "I'm lesbian, I'm bisexual, I'm gay, I'm transgendered," all of a sudden there will be reverberations throughout the entire family system. So, sometimes what we have are youth who come out of the closet and feel very comfortable, but then we sometimes have parents or guardians who go into the closet because they're embarrassed or they're ashamed or they're frightened about what's going on. So, affirmative counseling then, in this model, is helping youth and families to work together, uhm, in terms of shifting an identity and what that means for the whole family system. The next level of the model is developing a lesbian, bisexual, gay and or transgender intimacy status. And what this means is people, ah, start the dating process or become sexual and look for other people who will match in terms of their identity developing romantic, uhm, could be short-term and/or long-term intimate relationships. And so, for example, in a high school, we may have someone who say, "Hey, you know, I, I'm having a date, ah, and I'm a bisexual man and I've fallen in love with this, or I'm a bisexual boy, I've fallen in love with this, ah, gay, boy and we're gonna go to the prom." And so, that would be an example of developing an intimacy status. And last but not the least, there's the idea of, ah, what, ah, we call entering a lesbian, bisexual, gay and or transgendered community and not all persons would be able to do this because of reasons around violence and the reasons around safety. But what we look for in this model is people's ability to say, "I'm proud of who I am internally. I'm proud of who I am externally. And now I want to share the wealth and I want to develop with other members of the community." Uhm, places that, ah, it could be a place of worship, it could be a sporting league, it could be support groups. Uhm, but it's developing a community of resources, be it family of origin or family of choice. And of the six developmental stages, it's important to know that this is not a linear model, part of why Lynn and I have selected this model as being the best that we have found for working with lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgendered youth and families, is that all six of the areas are areas that people may be working on their entire lives. So other folks from school, be it, uhm, in, in high school, in college or well beyond college. These are the major developmental tasks for all lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgendered persons.

FIRST SCENARIO AN ADOLESCENT EXITING HETEROSEXUAL/TRADITIONAL GENDER IDENTITY 

00:31:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES In the first vignette of the developmental model in working with lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgendered youth and families, what we want to illustrate, ah, is the first level of the model, Exiting Heterosexual Identity and/or a Traditional Gender Identity. In this particular vignette, Theresa is an 18-year-old high school senior and I'm the school counselor. We've been working for several sessions, so we are already into the midst of material. It's important for all of us to remember that doing this work takes a great deal of building trust and credibility and that it takes time to do this work. We will show just a few minutes of the scenario and it's also important to remember that we will be going through many issues in just a few minutes. Usually, a counselor would spend much more time in terms of working through the issues in a particular session. 

00:32:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Hey, Theresa, how are you doin'? 

00:32:25
THERESA WYRE Hello! How are you? 

00:32:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Well, I'm fine. Thank you. I'm glad that you could come for session today and - 

00:32:30
THERESA WYRE Uh-hmm. 

00:32:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES - what would you like to work on? 

00:32:30
THERESA WYRE Well, lately I've been feeling rather confused. I'm not really sure - 

00:32:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Hmm. 

00:32:35
THERESA WYRE - whether I'm lesbian or bisexual. I already shared with you, I know that I ha-- I'm attracted to other girls but - 

00:32:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:32:45
THERESA WYRE - I still kind of like boys. 

00:32:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. So, it sounds like you're not sure about who you are. And what you'd like to work on today is to get some clarity about who you really are. 

00:32:55
THERESA WYRE Right. 

00:32:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. All right, well, we had talked last time about your trying to talk to maybe some friends or getting some more information about the differences between lesbian and bisexual. What have you learned? 

00:33:10
THERESA WYRE Tsk, well, not much. I only have one friend that I can actually talk to about this. 

00:33:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:33:15
THERESA WYRE But all she keeps telling me is to just be myself, but - 

00:33:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:33:20
THERESA WYRE - I don't know who myself is. 

00:33:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. So, on the one hand, it feels good 'cuz she's affirming you but - 

00:33:25
THERESA WYRE Right. 

00:33:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES - on the other hand, it's not like she's giving you enough information. 

00:33:25
THERESA WYRE All right. 

00:33:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES So that must be pretty frustrating. 

00:33:30
THERESA WYRE It is. 

00:33:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, all right. And what about in terms of family, are you at the point, and I see your eyes get a light so that may have told me right there. Uhm, what would it be like if family found out about who you are - 

00:33:45
THERESA WYRE Oh - 

00:33:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES - or what's going on? 

00:33:45
THERESA WYRE - that is not possible right now. 

00:33:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:33:45
THERESA WYRE My family will not be very receptive to this. In our culture, my mother is West Indian. 

00:33:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:33:55
THERESA WYRE They - 

00:33:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:33:55
THERESA WYRE - they don't like lesbian and gay people. 

00:34:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Okay. So, as a young woman of West Indian ethnicity and either lesbian or bisexual identity, what does it mean to be all of whom you are? 

00:34:10
THERESA WYRE Oh, man, it's so hard. I'm 18. I'm trying to graduate from high school. I'm trying to keep my academics intact that I still - 

00:34:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:34:20
THERESA WYRE - have all of this stuff on my mind. I can't speak to - 

00:34:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:34:20
THERESA WYRE - my family because - 

00:34:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:34:25
THERESA WYRE - they won't receive this information very well - 

00:34:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:34:25
THERESA WYRE - and I don't know what to do. It's so much for me - 

00:34:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:34:30
THERESA WYRE - to deal with right now. 

00:34:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. And your friend, is she also of West Indian ethnicity, identity? 

00:34:35
THERESA WYRE Tsk, no. 

00:34:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES What is her? 

00:34:35
THERESA WYRE She's American. 

00:34:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES She's American. 

00:34:40
THERESA WYRE Yes. 

00:34:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. So, she's White or she's? 

00:34:40
THERESA WYRE Oh, no, she's Black. Yes. 

00:34:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES She's Black. Okay, all right. So, there are many similarities but there are also differences in terms of you're both Black women but there's some other, ah, challenges there as well. 

00:34:50
THERESA WYRE Right. 

00:34:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES So, if you're saying that you're suddenly confused, what can I help you specifically right now to clarify between differences of being lesbian or being bisexual? 

00:35:00
THERESA WYRE Well, I just feel like I'm more attracted to girls than I am to boys. 

00:35:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:35:10
THERESA WYRE I think I share a little more int-- intimacy with girls. 

00:35:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:35:10
THERESA WYRE But I still like boys. 

00:35:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. So, ah, if I'm hearing you correctly, you wanna be friends with everybody but if you wanna be romantic or sexual at this point, you're interested primarily in, in girls or other young women. 

00:35:20
THERESA WYRE Yes. 

00:35:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

00:35:25
THERESA WYRE Yes. 

00:35:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right. And have you had the chance to do any dating, any exploration to find out? 

00:35:30
THERESA WYRE Yes, actually - 

00:35:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Hmm. 

00:35:30
THERESA WYRE - I'm seeing someone in the school right now. A young lady. 

00:35:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Wow! Congratulations! 

00:35:35
THERESA WYRE Thank you. 

00:35:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right. And what's that like for you? 

00:35:40
THERESA WYRE Oh, it's great! I love being with her. 

00:35:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. So it feels really good? 

00:35:45
THERESA WYRE Yes, it does. 

00:35:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES That's kind of sounds like you found yourself then, is that? 

00:35:45
THERESA WYRE Ah, not really. There's still this boy that I like. 

00:35:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Ah, okay, all right. So, for now, it's fun to be dating her but there's still this boy that you like, too. 

00:35:55
THERESA WYRE Right. 

00:35:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES So you're not sure. 

00:35:55
THERESA WYRE Right, right. 

00:35:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right. Well, we talked about say, like through the internet or getting some books to read about differences between being bisexual or being lesbian. 

00:36:05
THERESA WYRE Okay. 

00:36:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Did you have the chance to do anything like that? 

00:36:05
THERESA WYRE No, I haven't done that. 

00:36:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES No. Okay, all right. There are several books that I'd like to offer you to talk about and particularly some that have examples of youth of color in them, so that you can feel like you can be all of who you are. Ho-- how would that be? To be able to read stories about other youth, that would reflect all of who you are? 

00:36:25
THERESA WYRE That would be very good because that's one of the reasons why my friend and I are not telling anyone - 

00:36:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:36:30
THERESA WYRE - because we hear so many other students speaking of, speaking badly about gay people and lesbian people. So, 

00:36:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:36:35
THERESA WYRE that's one of the reasons why - 

00:36:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Hmm. 

00:36:40
THERESA WYRE - we haven't said - 

00:36:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:36:40
THERESA WYRE - anything to anyone. 

00:36:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES So, it's pretty scary when you walk out in the halls of the school and you hear sometimes teachers or other students calling you dike or you're fag or - 

00:36:50
THERESA WYRE Yes. 

00:36:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES - these really nasty, really hateful terms. 

00:36:50
THERESA WYRE Yes. 

00:36:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES One of the things that I'd like to offer is if you hear any of that I'd like to know about that, ah, in addition, so that I can maybe work with some of the teachers or your administrators because we have a zero tolerance policy that shouldn't be going on at all. You and I both know it shouldn't. The reality is that it does. 

00:37:10
THERESA WYRE All right. 

00:37:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES So let me take that on and work with some other folks. I would never say a word about how I heard about what's going on. But clearly there's some work in the school we need to do to make this a safe place for the two of you. 

00:37:20
THERESA WYRE Okay. 

00:37:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES In addition, uhm, if your friend at this point would like to come in and talk with me, I'd love to be able to be supportive for her, too. 

00:37:30
THERESA WYRE I think that's okay. 

00:37:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right. Do you think that'll be okay? 

00:37:30
THERESA WYRE And I think she'd like that. 

00:37:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right. Or if the two of you wanna come in together to talk about what's going on. 

00:37:35
THERESA WYRE Okay. It sounds great. 

00:37:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah. Okay. Anything else that you'd like to work on today? 

00:37:40
THERESA WYRE Uhm, not really. I think that's enough for today. 

00:37:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, all right. It sounds like what we've done at this point then is to try and further clarify differences between what it means to be bisexual and lesbian. You can, being bisexual is attraction to both genders, you may or may not act on it. Being lesbian, primarily, you'd be attracted to, to women. 

00:38:00
THERESA WYRE Uh-hmm. 

00:38:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Ah, and then in addition, we've talked about what it means to be all of whom you are, as West Indian, as a young woman, as either a lesbian or bisexual, and then we've talked about what it means to survive in an environment in a high school where it's not always supportive or friendly or safe. And then talked about ways about how you can, ah, get extra support and be all of whom you are as a young woman of a non-dominant sexual orientation ethnic racial identity and gender. 

00:38:25
THERESA WYRE Okay. 

00:38:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES I look forward to seeing you again. Let's set another time for our next session. 

00:38:30
THERESA WYRE Okay, good. 

00:38:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:38:30
SECOND SCENARIO ASSISTING A TEACHER WITH DEVELOPING A STUDENT'S INTERNAL BISEXUAL IDENTITY 

00:38:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ In this second scenario, I'll be highlighting, uhm, the developmental stage of the model that speaks to developing one's gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, ah, identity. Ah, in this scenario, Michael, who is a teacher in the school in which I work is coming to me as the, ah, head of the Gay-Straight Student Alliance, ah, with a, uhm, a student who has come out to him as bisexual. This is new to him and so he's eliciting my help. Ah, Michael, you said that you wanted to spend us a little bit of private time behind closed doors discussing one of the students in your group that has come out to you as bisexual. Can you tell me just a little bit about that? 

00:39:30
MICHAEL W. RYAN Sure. I was surprised by one of the student's, uhm, decision to approach me. 

00:39:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:39:35
MICHAEL W. RYAN And, ah, uhm, declare his bisexuality or what he feels his bisexuality. 

00:39:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:39:40
MICHAEL W. RYAN Ah, I want to be there for him, be very supportive, be affirming of his decision or, ah, I don't know if I should say decision but perhaps his, ah - 

00:39:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh hmm, Uh-hmm. 

00:39:50
MICHAEL W. RYAN - ah, what he feels he, he needs to do with in his life. 

00:39:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:39:55
MICHAEL W. RYAN But at the same... 

00:39:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Do, do you mind, mind if I in, inter-- interrupt - 

00:39:55
MICHAEL W. RYAN Uh-hmm. 

00:39:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - interrupt you there and ask you, uhm, what you mean by, ah, decision, uhm, in terms of. 

00:40:05
MICHAEL W. RYAN Sure, I don't believe that it is a desic-- decision sel--, ah, whatever they may say, "Well, let me decide if I'll be gay or straight or bisexual today." 

00:40:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay. 

00:40:15
MICHAEL W. RYAN I think that it is something that is, uhm, part of them. 

00:40:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:40:15
MICHAEL W. RYAN And, the decision isn't really the, the best word to use, but perhaps I should say his, uhm, ah, discovery - 

00:40:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:40:25
MICHAEL W. RYAN - of the bisexuality. 

00:40:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:40:25
MICHAEL W. RYAN Uhm, but, uhm, what causes me some concern and what I'm hoping you can help me with is the fact that I don't know much about bisexuality at all. 

00:40:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:40:35
MICHAEL W. RYAN As a matter of fact, I don't think I even know any bisexuals, with the exception of this student. 

00:40:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:40:40
MICHAEL W. RYAN So, I need to get some information - 

00:40:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:40:45
MICHAEL W. RYAN - that I can then pass on to him - 

00:40:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:40:45
MICHAEL W. RYAN - to help him, uhm, feel more at ease, more a part of the world with, ah, the new step that he's taken in his life. 

00:40:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. One of the things for me that it sounds like is one, you're, you're se, you're seeking information, uhm - 

00:41:00
MICHAEL W. RYAN Uh-hmm. 

00:41:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - from me, sort of in a consultant role, but what's, one of the key pieces for me as well is I'm a, I'm a consultant, but there's a parallel process to what I'll be, ah, giving you in terms of information and asking you to do, do some exploration as well around your notion, your belief system, your feelings about, ah, bisexual people and then what you will be and how you may be working, ah, with this student. 

00:41:30
MICHAEL W. RYAN Uh-hmm. 

00:41:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uhm, ah, you said that you have had at this point nobody tell you before that they were, uhm, bisexual. 

00:41:40
MICHAEL W. RYAN Right. 

00:41:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Ah, but that doesn't necessarily mean there had been no bisexual people in your life. 

00:41:45
MICHAEL W. RYAN That's correct. 

00:41:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay, okay. Can you speak to me a little bit about your own, ah, feelings, thoughts, concerns, the knowledge about bisexuality? 

00:42:00
MICHAEL W. RYAN Sure, well, as I've had mentioned, I have limited or, or very little knowledge at all about bisexuality. 

00:42:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:42:05
MICHAEL W. RYAN Ah, I had tended to view, uhm, so many things as being either lesbian, gay, or straight without really taking into mind - 

00:42:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:42:15
MICHAEL W. RYAN - the fact that there are people who, uhm, who are bisexual, who do not feel that they fit into any one of the categories. 

00:42:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:42:25
MICHAEL W. RYAN Uhm, I want to be able to understand to the best of my ability, ah, bisexuality, so I don't feel that I would have to project upon the student. 

00:42:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:42:35
MICHAEL W. RYAN That it is a choice one must have to, one must be, ah, either gay or straight or, or lesbian. 

00:42:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:42:45
MICHAEL W. RYAN And, uhm, and forget about the fact that bisexuality actually does exist and it is, uhm, a possibility that this is where the student actually finds himself. 

00:42:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. And how do you feel about that? 

00:42:55
MICHAEL W. RYAN The fact that he is, ah, uhm, feeling this and coming to me about it. 

00:43:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:43:00
MICHAEL W. RYAN I think it's very wonderful - 

00:43:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:43:00
MICHAEL W. RYAN - and the fact that he is coming to me is also - 

00:43:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:43:05
MICHAEL W. RYAN - something that makes me feel very good. 

00:43:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:43:05
MICHAEL W. RYAN Uhm. 

00:43:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ It certainly speaks to your level of trust and rapport that you have with the student. But I'm more curious about your, your own emotions around, your own feelings around someone saying, "I'm bisexual." 

00:43:20
MICHAEL W. RYAN You know, I don't believe I've given it much thought, but I'd have to say that, ah, if a person, uhm, were to come to me and, and, and tell me that they are bisexual, as this student did, and then to examine my feelings of it, uhm, I think it's a, it, it's a wonderful choice. Ah, again I don't wanna use the word choice because, uhm, I don't, uhm, it's not something that I believe is that they can sit and choose, but it is, it's a wonderful, uhm, uhm, factor that they have discovered in their life, is that. 

00:43:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ It's a wonder-- it's a wonderful aspect of their identity. 

00:43:55
MICHAEL W. RYAN Yes, it is something that they have found that, ah, further explains who they are, not only to themselves and to, ah - 

00:44:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:44:00
MICHAEL W. RYAN - as to the rest of the world as well. 

00:44:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. As you're working with the student and helping he or she, uhm, develop their bisexual identity, I, I think one of the key pieces is to help him or her understand their own emotions about being bisexual and dealing with, you know, some of the myths and stereotypes that we have, even just in, within the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender community that says, "Well, you know, you're a fence sitter, you're confused, you don't know what you want, you're, eventually you're gonna end up gay, you're going to end up straight," you know, all sort of things. So why don't you, to just even, just for like a brief moment to sit back and think, "Where am I, where am I at?" in that, in that belief system. 

00:44:55
MICHAEL W. RYAN I don't want to believe that one has to label themselves as gay - 

00:45:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:45:00
MICHAEL W. RYAN - or lesbian, but they'd have certainly all the right - 

00:45:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:45:05
MICHAEL W. RYAN - to define themselves - 

00:45:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:45:05
MICHAEL W. RYAN - as bisexual. 

00:45:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:45:10
MICHAEL W. RYAN And I, uhm, want to support that 100 percent. 

00:45:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:45:15
MICHAEL W. RYAN Ah, I don't want to find that I, uhm, categorize people either. 

00:45:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:45:20
MICHAEL W. RYAN I want to be, uhm, very accepting, so I can then be affirming. 

00:45:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:45:20
MICHAEL W. RYAN To the individuals - 

00:45:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:45:25
MICHAEL W. RYAN - with, ah, how they do define themselves. 

00:45:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. I'm hearing what you want to do - 

00:45:30
MICHAEL W. RYAN Uh-hmm. 

00:45:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - and that you probably are in terms of a very affirming, ah, person, ah, ah, I mean the student probably wouldn't have come out to you as bise-- sexual, if you hadn't been that kind of person. But having it heard from you, where you're at in your, your own thought process is, for the lack of a better word, "Is bisexuality legitimate for you?" Or are you believing, " Maybe they are confused, maybe you are a fence sitter, maybe they'll discover themselves as a, a gay or lesbian person the more they participate in our group." 

00:46:10
MICHAEL W. RYAN Well, any one of those things, I think, could be possible. 

00:46:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:46:10
MICHAEL W. RYAN But because it is something that is, uhm, almost new to me, the idea of dealing with and fully - 

00:46:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:46:20
MICHAEL W. RYAN - comprehending - 

00:46:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:46:20
MICHAEL W. RYAN - bisexuality, I certainly am going to work - 

00:46:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:46:25
MICHAEL W. RYAN - at becoming very open and accepting, uhm, I can't say that it is all very, uhm, old hat to me - 

00:46:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:46:35
MICHAEL W. RYAN - because it is something new - 

00:46:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:46:35
MICHAEL W. RYAN - but I know exactly where I want to be with it - 

00:46:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:46:35
MICHAEL W. RYAN - and that's what I'll work to, to be so I can make, ah - 

00:46:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:46:40
MICHAEL W. RYAN - things comfortable not only for myself, but for those that I would be counseling - 

00:46:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:46:45
MICHAEL W. RYAN - as well. 

00:46:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay, so one of the things that you, I, I guess I would encourage you to do is to continue to explore what your own belief systems are on that, uhm, because you're gonna ask the same of this, this, this student, both as perhaps as an individual and then maybe within the context of the, of the group that you're running. Ah, I'm curious as to whether you've had any, uhm, ah, if you've read any books or have been, you know, ah, both fiction and non-fiction, saw any movies, have any, ah, sense of who bisexual people are. 

00:47:20
MICHAEL W. RYAN Well, there's been certainly, uhm, a great amount, I think, in the area of fiction that most of us have been aware, in movies, in, in literature. 

00:47:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:47:30
MICHAEL W. RYAN Uhm, but I want to, uhm, I want to for my, for my own good and for the good of my - 

00:47:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:47:35
MICHAEL W. RYAN - group and, and - 

00:47:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:47:40
MICHAEL W. RYAN - the students I'll be counseling, uhm, read and, uhm, become aware of - 

00:47:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:47:45
MICHAEL W. RYAN - non-fiction, actual personal accounts of people - 

00:47:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:47:50
MICHAEL W. RYAN - who are bisexual - 

00:47:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:47:50
MICHAEL W. RYAN - so I can learn more from that myself - 

00:47:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:47:50
MICHAEL W. RYAN - and then, ah, in turn - 

00:47:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:47:55
MICHAEL W. RYAN - be a better person to help those - 

00:47:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:47:55
MICHAEL W. RYAN - who, ah, who may come to me in question. 

00:47:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Like I said, I do have a list of resources and I will give them to you, uhm, and before we end today, but one book in particular that I would, ah, like you to look at is a book called, "Bi Any Other Name," and that's b-i, versus b-y. 

00:48:10
MICHAEL W. RYAN Uh-hmm. 

00:48:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ And to, you know read that. It's a, it's what you have, you know, were just talking about, it's like, you know, a series of personal stories and accounts of what it is to be, ah, bisexual and I think that might help you, ah, with your own process, as you're helping somebody else with their process in establishing a bisexual identity. So, are there other questions, thoughts, concerns that you might have right now that you want to address? I have my resource list here to give you, so. 

00:48:45
MICHAEL W. RYAN I think the resource list would be a very excellent start for me. 

00:48:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:48:45
MICHAEL W. RYAN And, ah, something that I can also pass on to others. 

00:48:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:48:50
MICHAEL W. RYAN And, uhm, or certainly will keep the option - 

00:48:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:48:55
MICHAEL W. RYAN - open to come back and, and find out more from you in the future. 

00:48:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay, just as a last, last thing, I would just encourage you to get to know the people around you and see if there are other bisexual people, uhm, in your life and if not, to try and to broaden your, ah, community a bit, so you know who bisexual people are and what their lives are about so. 

00:49:15
MICHAEL W. RYAN That sounds good. 

00:49:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Well, thank you so much for stopping by and feel free to come by anytime. 

00:49:20
MICHAEL W. RYAN Thank you. 

00:49:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Hmm, you're welcome. 

00:49:20
SCENARIO THREE EXTERNAL LBGT IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT; TRANSGENDER YOUTH TRANSITION ISSUES SCENARIO 

00:49:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. The third level of the model is, ah, external identity development for lesbian, bisexual, gay and or transgender person and again this is a process that occurs over the lifespan. In this particular scenario, again abbreviated because of time, Kris is an 18-year-old high school student just starting senior year and has just announced in the first session to the school counselor that Kris is transgendered and is interested in going through sex reassignment surgery and hormones to become the man that he has always wanted to be. In this scenario, ah, the school counselor works to talk about how Kris can safely do a transition in this very conservative school and community. 

00:50:15
[sil.] 

00:50:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Hey Kris, how you doing? 

00:50:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW Hanging in there. 

00:50:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Good. I know last week you shared with me that you are in the process of wanting to shift your gender identity and, ah, I was really honored that you could come and share with me such personal intimate information and I admire your courage. I know that we talked about talking this week about what in the world do you do because here you are in this very conservative school and very conservative community. 

00:50:50
KRISPIN MATTHEW Well, you know, we talked last session about, you know, some of my options and, uhm, I'd expressed to you this desire to, uhm, really make the full transition. 

00:51:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:51:00
KRISPIN MATTHEW At this point. 

00:51:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:51:00
KRISPIN MATTHEW I just, I can't take it anymore, uhm - 

00:51:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:51:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW - ah, you know, I live, I've lived this way in this body that I hate for so long - 

00:51:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:51:10
KRISPIN MATTHEW - and I just can't take it. I'm, you know, in my senior year and I wanna be able to make the transition before I go off to college. 

00:51:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:51:15
KRISPIN MATTHEW Uhm, but my fear is that since seeing you last week, I saw this movie called, "Boys Don't Cry." 

00:51:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:51:25
KRISPIN MATTHEW I don't know if you've seen it, but, uhm, the main character in that movie is me, I mean I - 

00:51:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Hmm. 

00:51:30
KRISPIN MATTHEW - it's me and, uhm, I saw it not really knowing, uhm, you know, how powerful it was gonna be that and it just struck me. 

00:51:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:51:40
KRISPIN MATTHEW It just and now, I'm just scared to death, I'm scared to death. 

00:51:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:51:45
KRISPIN MATTHEW About making this transition. 

00:51:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. I want you to hold on, take a deep breath, there's so much that's going on right now, I, I can appreciate your sharing all of it. So, at this point what I've heard you say is that you're feeling really I think, stressed, nervous, angry, upset, want to do the transition right away. Last week, I know you shared that your parents know what's going on. You've disclosed to them and - 

00:52:10
KRISPIN MATTHEW Yeah. 

00:52:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES - they're supportive, so that's terrific. 

00:52:15
KRISPIN MATTHEW Yeah, they are. 

00:52:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES And then. 

00:52:15
KRISPIN MATTHEW They're, they're really supportive. 

00:52:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah. 

00:52:15
KRISPIN MATTHEW Which is, ah, it's been great, but, you know, I, I'm gonna be out in the world soon, like - 

00:52:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh. 

00:52:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW - and, and being in school. 

00:52:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:52:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW It's just so hard. 

00:52:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:52:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW It's just so hard. 

00:52:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES And, and so at this point, you haven't shared anything to anyone in the school other than me? 

00:52:30
KRISPIN MATTHEW No. 

00:52:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Correct? 

00:52:30
KRISPIN MATTHEW No. 

00:52:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES And so as you want sounds like is to how to figure out I go about doing this in the school, okay? 

00:52:35
KRISPIN MATTHEW But I'm scared for my life. 

00:52:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:52:40
KRISPIN MATTHEW Like, I listen, you know, my whole life I've been called every name in the book - 

00:52:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:52:45
KRISPIN MATTHEW - because of the way that I dress, the way that I act. 

00:52:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:52:45
KRISPIN MATTHEW You know, I've always been - 

00:52:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:52:45
KRISPIN MATTHEW - more into guy sports, so to speak. 

00:52:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:52:50
KRISPIN MATTHEW Uhm, you know, I love baseball and football. I love hanging out with the guys. 

00:52:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:52:55
KRISPIN MATTHEW And, and that's just my thing and I've always been called, you know, that I'm weird, that I'm a dyke, that I'm, you know, just everything you could ever imagine. 

00:53:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:53:00
KRISPIN MATTHEW And, uhm, you, you know, I'm just sick of it and, but I listen to these things and the jokes that people tell all day and so if I come out as this person, you know, and come out with the truth, like I just can't imagine what they would say or do to me. 

00:53:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES So you're afraid that you might get beaten up - 

00:53:15
KRISPIN MATTHEW Oh yeah. 

00:53:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES - or you might get attacked or verbally harassed and, and some of that has already occurred. 

00:53:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW Although, yeah. 

00:53:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES It sounds like, without people knowing about who you really are. 

00:53:25
KRISPIN MATTHEW Oh, yeah, just by what they see on the outside, they. 

00:53:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah. Yeah. It sounds very scary and very frightening, yeah? 

00:53:30
KRISPIN MATTHEW Yeah. 

00:53:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Tell me about who in school you're close to in terms of other kids? 

00:53:35
KRISPIN MATTHEW At this point, not really anyone. 

00:53:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, so you really don't have any friends in the school, you were pretty isolated on your own. Your grades have been really good, uhm, and it sounds like you're close to some of the teachers? 

00:53:50
KRISPIN MATTHEW Uhm, yeah, there are a couple that I, I feel comfortable working with. They don't know. 

00:53:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES But they have no idea of who you are? 

00:53:55
KRISPIN MATTHEW No, but they seemed to just kind of accept me - 

00:53:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:53:55
KRISPIN MATTHEW - at least, you know, the way I dress - 

00:53:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:53:55
KRISPIN MATTHEW - and stuff. 

00:53:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah. So one of the things we need to work on then is to look at what it's gonna be like for the school, cuz as far as I know, you, you may not be the only one, but that you're the only one that I know of in the history of the school that has wanted to go through, uhm, a gender change operation while they're in school. You could delay until summer, is that an option? 

00:54:15
KRISPIN MATTHEW Well, I thought about that, but I, I really, it's so important for me to make this change before I get to college, so that when I get to college, people don't know what I was - 

00:54:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:54:25
KRISPIN MATTHEW - before. 

00:54:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES So, it sounds like if it seeing you at the better and part of it might be that you could do it or begin to make the transition between the semesters. 

00:54:35
KRISPIN MATTHEW Maybe. 

00:54:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm, yeah. 

00:54:35
KRISPIN MATTHEW I just, yeah, you know, I, I gotta, I have to do this. I can't take it anymore, I, I just can't. 

00:54:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:54:40
KRISPIN MATTHEW But I, I don't, but I'm scared to death to do it, like I. 

00:54:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. So on the one hand, it's like, you found out who you are and you know who you are, you're very proud, excited about - 

00:54:50
KRISPIN MATTHEW Yeah. 

00:54:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES - that on the inside and now you wanna share it with the world. But on the other hand, it's really scary - 

00:54:55
KRISPIN MATTHEW Right. 

00:55:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES - about what might occur particularly once your peers or, or teachers if they found out. 

00:55:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW Oh, yeah, I mean, that's exactly right, 

00:55:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:55:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW that's exactly right - 

00:55:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:55:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW - and I just, you know, I know what feels right. 

00:55:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:55:10
KRISPIN MATTHEW And I know, at least I think I know - 

00:55:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:55:15
KRISPIN MATTHEW - where I should be as a person and, and what - 

00:55:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:55:15
KRISPIN MATTHEW - I should really look like and - 

00:55:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

00:55:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW I wanna get there. 

00:55:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:55:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW But I, I'm scared. 

00:55:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

00:55:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW I'm just scared. 

00:55:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES You talked earlier about having seen the movie, "Boys Don't Cry." 

00:55:25
KRISPIN MATTHEW Right. 

00:55:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES And, of course, that's about, uhm, a young person who is transgendered and who ultimately ends up being killed and I would like to know how you're feeling at this point, having seen, ah, this young man that you identified with completely in the movie and knowing that he was murdered for being transgendered. 

00:55:45
KRISPIN MATTHEW Uhm. 

00:55:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES How does that make you feel? 

00:55:45
KRISPIN MATTHEW It just, it struck me ah, so tremendously, well I guess that that's what caused me to start to question this whole thing. I was feeling so confident - 

00:55:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:55:55
KRISPIN MATTHEW - about - 

00:55:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:55:55
KRISPIN MATTHEW - going through with this and just being like, you know I don't care what other people think. 

00:56:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh. 

00:56:00
KRISPIN MATTHEW I'll just be me. 

00:56:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh. 

00:56:00
KRISPIN MATTHEW Well, oh my God, that's what, you know, that's what he did and he went out - 

00:56:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh. 

00:56:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW - and he went to be the person that he felt most comfortable as and at one point in the movie, uhm, he said to his girlfriends, you know, suddenly everything just felt right. The day that he could walk out - 

00:56:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh. 

00:56:15
KRISPIN MATTHEW - and just be - 

00:56:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh. 

00:56:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW - him and I wanna get there, but, ah, as soon as he did that thing, as soon as he reached that point, his life was over, like then that, you know, everything just started to fall apart at that point, you know, people, uhm, you know, he got started getting treated more and more horribly, he was raped, he was beaten and then he was shot to death and, God, what if, what if that to me like, ah. 

00:56:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES So all this terror, all this fear has come up around that and it sounds like part of you is like pushing you to go even faster to get the transition down as soon as possible, but the scary part is what's gonna happen to you if you do let other people know what's going on. 

00:57:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW Yeah, I feel like if I can - 

00:57:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Hmm. 

00:57:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW - just get to that next point - 

00:57:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Hmm. 

00:57:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW - without anyone seeing - 

00:57:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:57:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW - the transition point - 

00:57:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:57:10
KRISPIN MATTHEW - because that's - 

00:57:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:57:10
KRISPIN MATTHEW - that's where he got in trouble, so to speak - 

00:57:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:57:10
KRISPIN MATTHEW - like they were able to recognize - 

00:57:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Hmm. 

00:57:15
KRISPIN MATTHEW - that he was really a she and, you know - 

00:57:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:57:15
KRISPIN MATTHEW - went after her for all that. 

00:57:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:57:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW For just being something that wasn't acceptable - 

00:57:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:57:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW - and that they couldn't understand - 

00:57:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:57:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW - so I feel like if I can just skip, you know, were no one - 

00:57:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Right. 

00:57:25
KRISPIN MATTHEW - sees that transition - 

00:57:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Right. Uh-hmm. 

00:57:25
KRISPIN MATTHEW Maybe, so when I get to college, I'm just a, I'm a guy. 

00:57:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Right. 

00:57:30
KRISPIN MATTHEW And no one knows what I was before. 

00:57:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES And the issue is of course you're a, a little over a year away from starting college. 

00:57:35
KRISPIN MATTHEW I, ah. 

00:57:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES And you'd like to do this during your senior year. I wonder if this would be helpful. May I have your permission to talk to some of the administrators in the school, to say that there is a student, these things are going on and how can we administratively support the student, uhm, in at this point, transition to being male? 

00:57:55
KRISPIN MATTHEW I don't know. How, how safe do you think that is? Like how... 

00:58:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES I'm, I'm not sure. I wouldn't wanna break confidentiality to do it. 

00:58:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW Right. 

00:58:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES But I'd like to at least talk with you about the possibility of preparing administrators, so they can prepare the teachers. How does that feel? 

00:58:15
KRISPIN MATTHEW I don't know, it's interesting I, I don't know how nervous I am about the teachers. 

00:58:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh. 

00:58:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW It's my classmates - 

00:58:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh. 

00:58:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW - that I'm like - 

00:58:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh. 

00:58:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW - terrified about. You know, I, I feel like the teachers in some way would be more accepting and even if they weren't, I don't see them being violent with me. 

00:58:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah, the teachers aren't gonna go after you because of who you are. 

00:58:30
KRISPIN MATTHEW I, I, yeah. 

00:58:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES The fear is that your peers . 

00:58:35
KRISPIN MATTHEW I feel protected there in some way - 

00:58:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. Uh-huh. 

00:58:35
KRISPIN MATTHEW - but with my peers , I mean, who knows, right? 

00:58:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Part of my thinking was that if we can at least alert school personnel I mean, policies behind going on right now because there isn't any protection of gender identity in the state, in this town, let alone in our school policies - 

00:58:50
KRISPIN MATTHEW Right. 

00:58:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES - and I'm wondering if structurally that would be good or we could even ask your parents if that would be all right to have their permission to meet with administrators, cuz clearly they're supportive of you in your transition. 

00:59:00
KRISPIN MATTHEW Right. Yeah, they are and I, I think they'd be okay with that, I mean any support that I could be given - 

00:59:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah. 

00:59:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW I, 

00:59:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh. 

00:59:10
KRISPIN MATTHEW - but I don't know, I'm just sort of really tentative about that. 

00:59:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh. 

00:59:10
KRISPIN MATTHEW Right now. 

00:59:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh. 

00:59:15
KRISPIN MATTHEW Maybe we cannot talk about that. 

00:59:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, yeah, would, well, so maybe in our next session, we could talk about that at least I wanna introduce the idea. The other one is, do you have access to the Internet? 

00:59:25
KRISPIN MATTHEW Yeah. 

00:59:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, have you gotten into any chat rooms or talked with any other transgendered youth at this point? 

00:59:30
KRISPIN MATTHEW Uhm, I haven't. I know you had mentioned it before. 

00:59:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:59:30
KRISPIN MATTHEW And that makes me a little nervous too, but, uhm - 

00:59:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

00:59:35
KRISPIN MATTHEW - you know, I know I should probably give it a shot, that's probably the safest way for me, at least to communicate with other people. 

00:59:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. So, why don't we give you a homework assignment, maybe by next week, you will have attempt to analyze some sites that I can give you for reference. You will attempt to contact at least one other transgendered youth and talk about - 

00:59:50
KRISPIN MATTHEW Okay. 

00:59:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES - what it's like, what's going on. 

00:59:55
KRISPIN MATTHEW Okay. 

00:59:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Cuz I hear you sounding really isolated and all alone. Is that, is that correct? All right. 

01:00:00
KRISPIN MATTHEW Yeah, I don't, Right now you're at like that. 

01:00:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. So, we've gotta break that isolation cuz I'm happy to be your ally in here for you but I'm an adult. And what we need is for you to find other peers. 

01:00:15
KRISPIN MATTHEW Okay. 

01:00:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah. All right. Well again, I, I really admire your courage and your honesty and I appreciate you being in here. And what I'd like to do then is just to have you stay in touch with me. We'll set, ah, a time to meet in the next couple of days and we'll pick up from there. Okay? 

01:00:30
KRISPIN MATTHEW Okay, okay. 

01:00:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Anything else that you'd like to share that, that we haven't talked about at this point? 

01:00:35
KRISPIN MATTHEW I don't think so. I mean, it's just all so overwhelming and, ah. 

01:00:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:00:40
KRISPIN MATTHEW I'm just really confused and frustrated right now. 

01:00:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah. 

01:00:40
KRISPIN MATTHEW And like you said, I mean I'm really, I don't have anyone to talk to about this. 

01:00:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:00:45
KRISPIN MATTHEW So, I mean, I appreciate you listening but I just, I don't know what we're gonna do. 

01:00:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. So, we will have you keep talking to your parents , keep talking with me. You do have three adults. And then you'll do the homework assignment of attempting to find some youth online, and then we'll pick up with this again next time. 

01:01:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW Okay. 

01:01:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:01:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW Uh-hmm. 

01:01:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Thanks, Kris. Take care. 

01:01:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW Thanks. 

01:01:10
SCENARIO FOUR LBGT OFFSPRING IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT; GAY MALE YOUTH SCENARIO 

01:01:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ In this next scenario, we're looking at developing a sense of becoming a lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender offspring. Ah, Jerry, who has been as, student of mine, ah, over the course of the academic year. He's 18 years old, of Chinese ethnicity. Uhm, he identifies as a gay male and we've explored that to some degree already. But now, there's a, he-- there's some concerns raised by his teachers about, uhm, his academic performance, and they think that there's more to that. So, I have invited Jerry into my office. And again, this is ah, a, a, a condensed version of a session. Ah, Jerry, we've met, ah, before, ah, you know, several times. And we talked - 

01:02:05
JERRY HSIEH Uh-hmm. 

01:02:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - about many different things about - 

01:02:05
JERRY HSIEH Yes. 

01:02:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - you know, what's going on in your life. Ah, but your teachers have raised recently some concerns about, uhm, you know, your academic grades and what might be happening at home and, and they're, they're not sure. And I'm wondering if you could just tell me what's, what's happening for you. 

01:02:20
JERRY HSIEH Yes, uhm, three years ago, my father passed away and I'm the only child. 

01:02:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:02:30
JERRY HSIEH So, for a Chinese family, my mother feel like it's, uhm, big responsibility for her to carry the family name. 

01:02:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:02:40
JERRY HSIEH But me being a gay man, I, every day I go home and when she ask me how's your school, how's your girlfriend, and I cannot answer those questions, I feel like - 

01:02:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:02:50
JERRY HSIEH - I'm living in this big lie. And even though I've, don't feel like going home now because all this problem I don't know how - 

01:03:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:03:00
JERRY HSIEH - to deal with my mother. And I don't know what to do. 

01:03:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. I can see that you're, even as you're speaking that your, your eyes are welling up a, a bit and it seems like this is a very, ah, emotional, ah - 

01:03:15
JERRY HSIEH Yes. 

01:03:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - thing for you to talk about. Ah, can you tell me a little bit more about the importance of your relationship with your mother and the, ah, need to fulfill that, uhm, the heterosexual identity. 

01:03:30
JERRY HSIEH Well for me, uhm, since I was a kid I was very close to my mother 

01:03:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:03:35
JERRY HSIEH - especially after my father passed away, we have been very close. And actually she asked me if I were a gay many times. 

01:03:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:03:45
JERRY HSIEH And I couldn't bring myself to tell her because once she told me if I were a gay, she's going to kill herself. She feel like she didn't - 

01:03:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:03:55
JERRY HSIEH - perform a good job. She didn't bring me up - 

01:04:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:04:00
JERRY HSIEH - right. So. 

01:04:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:04:00
JERRY HSIEH I'm a gay. She kind of blamed everything on herself. 

01:04:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:04:05
JERRY HSIEH But, I just want her to know that's not her fault. It's my, it's me, I'm gay. It's not because of she didn't do a good job - 

01:04:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:04:15
JERRY HSIEH - or anything. It's nothing to do with her and I don't wanna hurt her. 

01:04:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:04:20
JERRY HSIEH But I don't know what to tell her that - 

01:04:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-huh. 

01:04:20
JERRY HSIEH - my sexual orientation. 

01:04:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So, you're very mindful of her feelings and yet - 

01:04:25
JERRY HSIEH Yes. 

01:04:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - at the same time responding to there's a great deal of responsibility on me. "How can I let my," you know, " mother down." If that's in fact, you know, really what will happen. And I would like - 

01:04:40
JERRY HSIEH Yes. 

01:04:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - to take a minute to explore your level of your belief and does that really let my mother down? And the process that, ah, any parent of a gay, lesbian or bisexual or transgender child has to go through around, ah, loss of their idea of who their child is and who their child will be. 

01:05:00
JERRY HSIEH Uh-hmm. But also, my mother, she's also worried I think about the relatives or her friends - 

01:05:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:05:10
JERRY HSIEH - because she told me all her friends are asking her why I don't have a girlfriend. 

01:05:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:05:15
JERRY HSIEH And why this and why that, but I cannot answer those questions. 

01:05:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:05:20
JERRY HSIEH And I feel like I cannot go home now because every day I just feel - 

01:05:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:05:25
JERRY HSIEH - so bad I'm lying - 

01:05:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:05:25
JERRY HSIEH - to her and - 

01:05:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:05:30
JERRY HSIEH - so. 

01:05:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So, it's a very hard place to be in and one of - 

01:05:30
JERRY HSIEH Yeah. 

01:05:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - the things I certainly want you to feel is, you know, accepted and affirmed, uhm, in this office and to the best of my ability within - 

01:05:40
JERRY HSIEH Okay. 

01:05:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - within the school. Uhm, because, you know, oftentimes, gay youth can become homeless out of all of this fear. And, and I don't wanna see that happen - 

01:05:50
JERRY HSIEH Uh-hmm. 

01:05:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - for you. I'm curious as to, if you've known any other, uhm, gay, young gay, ah, men that have come out to their parents and what their experiences were. 

01:06:05
JERRY HSIEH Uhm, I have a Chinese gay friend - 

01:06:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:06:05
JERRY HSIEH - and he came out to his parents. 

01:06:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:06:10
JERRY HSIEH Uhm, but I think his parents doesn't, uhm, doesn't talk to him anymore after he came out. And I'm - 

01:06:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:06:15
JERRY HSIEH - afraid of that. 

01:06:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:06:20
JERRY HSIEH So, I don't want that happen and I wanna, I want my mother to be happy but at the - 

01:06:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:06:25
JERRY HSIEH - same time, I want me to be happy too. 

01:06:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:06:30
JERRY HSIEH So. 

01:06:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. So it's very difficult to straddle those fences - 

01:06:30
JERRY HSIEH Yes. 

01:06:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - and sound likes the one connection that you had with someone, ah, that was a, a gay male and also Chinese. 

01:06:40
JERRY HSIEH Yes. 

01:06:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ His experience was being rejected. 

01:06:40
JERRY HSIEH Yes. 

01:06:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ And, and that has helped fuel your fears - 

01:06:45
JERRY HSIEH Yes. 

01:06:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - of being rejected. One of the things I would like you to do is to explore, uhm, a little bit with me here but, you know, after the session I wanna give you a little bit of homework to explore, uhm, ah, and connect maybe with other people - 

01:07:05
JERRY HSIEH Uh-hmm. 

01:07:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - either, you know, via the internet or you, you know, you know that the school has a, has a, a group for - 

01:07:10
JERRY HSIEH Yes. 

01:07:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - uhm, gay, lesbian, and bisexual and - 

01:07:10
JERRY HSIEH Uh-hmm. 

01:07:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - transgender people and find out what their coming out stories have been to their parents. 

01:07:15
JERRY HSIEH Yeah. 

01:07:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Ah, because I think that's, that's particularly difficult - 

01:07:20
JERRY HSIEH Uh-hmm. 

01:07:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - and I think within your culture, it's particularly difficult. 

01:07:25
JERRY HSIEH Yes. 

01:07:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So, is there a way that you can, uhm, bridge that, value your culture - 

01:07:30
JERRY HSIEH Uh-hmm. 

01:07:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - and affirm who you are. 

01:07:35
JERRY HSIEH Okay. 

01:07:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ And at the same time, give your mother permission, she's gotta grieve, that's her stuff. And that's hard as a child to step away from. 

01:07:45
JERRY HSIEH Okay. 

01:07:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay? 

01:07:45
JERRY HSIEH Okay. 

01:07:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ And I can, I, and I can give you some other, ah, resources. There are some other coming out books that I think are, are very helpful - 

01:07:55
JERRY HSIEH Uh-hmm. 

01:07:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - uhm, that take into account, uhm, ethnic and cultural backgrounds. 

01:08:00
JERRY HSIEH Okay. 

01:08:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uhm, some of them don't as much. 

01:08:05
JERRY HSIEH Uh-hmm. 

01:08:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uhm, but there is a book called, ah, Coming Out With Love. And I think that would be, uhm, you know, one way to look at stories of other youths coming out to their families and how that has happened well, and to give you the idea, and then, and they help you shore up that belief system that it can happen, you know, in a wellness manner. 

01:08:30
JERRY HSIEH Okay. 

01:08:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay. 

01:08:30
JERRY HSIEH Thank you. 

01:08:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ All right, we'll talk a little more - 

01:08:30
JERRY HSIEH Okay. 

01:08:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - next time, all right? 

01:08:35
JERRY HSIEH Thank you so much. 

01:08:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Sure. 

01:08:35
SCENARIO FIVE LBGT AFFIRMING INTIMACY STATUS; INTERRACIAL GAY MALE PARENTS SCENARIO 

01:08:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES In the fourth stage of the Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, Transgender Identity Development Model, we look at developing an intimacy status. In this particular scenario, we have an interracial gay couple who's coming to see the school counselor. They have just transferred into this school district. And for the first time, they are sending their five-year-old daughter off to school. In this particular scenario, what we want to look at is how school, family and agency counselors are affirming of, ah, intimacy identity for, in this case, ah, a gay family. 

01:09:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Let's see, ah, Nelson and Adam? 

01:09:25
NELSON MEDINA Yes. 

01:09:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES And, and who's who? 

01:09:30
NELSON MEDINA I'm Nelson. 

01:09:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:09:30
ADAM L. BENSON I'm Adam. 

01:09:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Great. Adam and Nelson, wonderful to meet you, welcome to our school. 

01:09:35
NELSON MEDINA Thank you. 

01:09:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Ah, how can I be of assistance for you today? 

01:09:40
NELSON MEDINA Well, we just, ah, moved in from the city, uhm, with our five-year-old daughter. Ah, we just came from a great neighborhood. We, we're a, we're a gay couple, obviously, you know that, ah, with a five-year-old. We came from the city into the suburbs to raise our child. We've, we've brought her to this school and we had some concerns. We had a lot of concerns. 

01:09:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Okay. 

01:10:00
ADAM L. BENSON Yeah. Well, we were living in a, in a, we're coming from the city so we were in an area where there were lots of ah, validation, cuz there were other gay families there, and - 

01:10:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

01:10:10
ADAM L. BENSON - now that we, you know, our daughter wasn't going to school there, but now that we're bringing our daughter to school, we're kinda concerned about how - 

01:10:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:10:15
ADAM L. BENSON - validating - 

01:10:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:10:20
ADAM L. BENSON - your school - 

01:10:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:10:20
ADAM L. BENSON - would be for - 

01:10:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:10:20
ADAM L. BENSON - our type of family. 

01:10:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Well I wanna thank you both for coming in. I think it's terrific that you're here and, uhm, I wanna do whatever we can to be supportive of your family and all of who you are in our school. So, why don't we just let you ask questions and I'll do what I can? 

01:10:35
NELSON MEDINA Good. Well, I come from a very supportive, uhm, Puerto Rican family. 

01:10:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:10:45
NELSON MEDINA Uhm, my parents were very supportive of my sexuality - 

01:10:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:10:45
NELSON MEDINA - uhm, my two brothers and my sisters. So, I really never had a problem when it came to my lifestyle. 

01:10:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:10:50
NELSON MEDINA Uhm, now that we have our daughter, ah, and we're coming into the suburbs, we were kind of concerned of how the school community - 

01:11:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:11:00
NELSON MEDINA - ah, the staff, faculty, as well as the students - 

01:11:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:11:05
NELSON MEDINA - uhm, would nurture our child, knowing that we are a gay couple. 

01:11:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:11:10
NELSON MEDINA Ah, that's something that's really, uhm, bothering me since we really don't know the area. 

01:11:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:11:10
NELSON MEDINA Ah, we really don't know the people in the area, and we'd like to know what type of support we could be able, 

01:11:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:11:15
NELSON MEDINA that we would be able to get. 

01:11:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, okay. Well, let me think. At this point in time, as far as I know, you are the first open male couple that would be in the school and it's not to say that there aren't plenty of others around but this would be the first time - 

01:11:30
ADAM L. BENSON Uh-hmm. 

01:11:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES - that someone has come to our office and said, "This is who we are and what's going on." So, that would be a first in that way. I assume that in the school like in any other, there are certainly gay parents. Uhm, as far as I know most of the parents would identify if they are married as heterosexual but I don't know, I haven't checked. Ah, so, I think one of the things that I would like to propose is to see if I might be able to find out on my own, can I check are there others around, so that you don't have to do all the legwork with that. The second area is that there are a number of interracial couples in this particular school district, and they've actually fo-- uhm, formed a support group, and I would be confident and hopeful that that would be a place that you all could get a lot of support and, and friendship from. Again, I don't know for sure about sexual orientation. I think most of the couples would primarily identify as heterosexual, but I never assumed so, how does that sound to hear to both of those? 

01:12:25
NELSON MEDINA Sounds good to me. What do you think, Adam? 

01:12:30
ADAM L. BENSON Well, uhm, I think it might be good but I'm concerned because even, ah, the application form that I read - 

01:12:35
NELSON MEDINA Uh-hmm. 

01:12:35
ADAM L. BENSON - remember what, we were having - 

01:12:35
NELSON MEDINA Yeah. 

01:12:35
ADAM L. BENSON - some concerns about the form - 

01:12:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

01:12:40
ADAM L. BENSON - because, ah, it says on the form - 

01:12:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:12:40
ADAM L. BENSON - ah, it doesn't say parents. It says mother, father, and we're two gay dads. So, by the way, when we read the form, we thought that we were not really going to be included in the school setting. We feel, we feel that's, of, our first impression of the school was that it wasn't an inclusive school. 

01:13:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

01:13:00
PARENTS NEED SCHOOL SUPPORT 

01:13:00
NELSON MEDINA You know, we wonder, what is our daughter gonna think, the fact that they see mother, ah, ah, you know mother, father, and no dad and dad, you know. We'd like to know is there some type of support - 

01:13:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah. 

01:13:10
NELSON MEDINA - that the faculty or the teacher can provide the child. 

01:13:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Because of it's on our paperwork, if that's the paperwork, what's going on of the classrooms? 

01:13:20
NELSON MEDINA Exactly, exactly. 

01:13:20
ADAM L. BENSON Yeah. 

01:13:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Well, I, I want to apologize. I think you're absolutely right. I think those forms are horribly outdated, and it's just another reason that we need to change them so, let me make a personal commitment to talking with the principal and saying we want to update them for years, or we are moving into the next century, it's high time that we, that we do this. So, let me work on that, uhm, so that we can say parent and/or parents and guardians, things that would allow, a, a more inclusive way of looking at families. There are at least two teachers in the school who have, ah, that, that I know of, who have lesbian and gay family members, and I know that they have been very supportive, done a couple of staff workshops, things like that, but again it's a different one that's out there someone else, versus one of folks who are open with them at school. Ah, and so, I think that one of the things that I would want to offer to you is, uhm, let me talk with the teachers and the principal about your being here, and what we could do collectively to ensure that this is a safe place, not only for your five year old, uhm, but for both of you, I mean, how we would deal with if other parents have concerns or whatever. How does that sound? 

01:14:25
NELSON MEDINA That sounds pretty good. 

01:14:25
ADAM L. BENSON Yeah, pretty good. That sounds okay? 

01:14:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah, okay. 

01:14:25
NELSON MEDINA Step forward. 

01:14:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, 'cuz I think the other issue is that the two of you shouldn't have to do all the educating. 

01:14:30
NELSON MEDINA No. 

01:14:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES And in my experience, often as members of non-dominant groups, that we expect the folks who are being, you know, oppressed to do all the work, and that's not fair, okay? What else? 

01:14:45
ADAM L. BENSON Are there, ah, gay or lesbian teachers that you know of in this school? 

01:14:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. At this point in time, ah, how shall I say this? There are folks who, as you make yourselves open and known, may well be able to let you know about where they are at, but I don't have permission at this point to say there are people who were open or not. 

01:15:05
ADAM L. BENSON Uh-hmm. 

01:15:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES So, I'm giving you information, without giving you information, is that okay? 

01:15:10
NELSON MEDINA Sure. It's all right. 

01:15:10
ADAM L. BENSON Okay. 

01:15:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES If you are able to do what you're doing here, and I can say, "This is a gay couple who's out, who want to be known, and they'd love to be contacted," I am confident that you might hear something at some point in time. How does that sound? 

01:15:25
ADAM L. BENSON That sounds - 

01:15:25
NELSON MEDINA Good. 

01:15:25
ADAM L. BENSON - sounds good to me. 

01:15:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. A little more subtle than in the city, but I think you all had said that you weren't necessarily expecting ah, the same answer. You're expecting respect. You're expecting affirmation, and those are things we can definitely learn in school. We do have a safe schools mission statement. I'd be happy to share that with you, ah, and we do include sexual orientation as part of that statement. Uhm, we talk about race, ethnicity, uhm, age, ah, gender ah, social class, ah, religion, spirituality, 'cuz we want to be affirming of all children and youth and families too. 

01:15:55
ADAM L. BENSON And that's actually nice to hear. 

01:16:00
NELSON MEDINA We would appreciate the, the assistance you can provide us from the transition from the city to the suburbs cuz it's - 

01:16:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah. 

01:16:05
NELSON MEDINA - it's quite a transition. We just, we just, we're just concerned about our daughter . 

01:16:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:16:10
NELSON MEDINA We wanna make sure - 

01:16:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:16:10
NELSON MEDINA - that she's in an environment - 

01:16:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:16:10
NELSON MEDINA - that that's pretty safe - 

01:16:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:16:10
NELSON MEDINA - for her. 

01:16:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Do you all know about the Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, Transgender Community Center in our county? You heard about it? 

01:16:15
NELSON MEDINA Hmm, no. 

01:16:15
ADAM L. BENSON No. 

01:16:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. There is one, and I would suggest that you hook up with folks there immediately and give you the phone number and give you the name. Ah, there is a parent support group, although right now, ironically, I think it's primarily women, but clearly, there needs to be a men's parenting support group, ultimately a parent support group for lesbian, bisexual, gay, transgender folks. So, that might be an excellent connection as well, cuz it sounded to me like you wanted to connect with other folks. 

01:16:40
NELSON MEDINA Absolutely. 

01:16:40
ADAM L. BENSON Uh-hmm. 

01:16:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES And if we can't have you do that, say with the parents in our district, you certainly can do with plenty of parents in others. 

01:16:50
NELSON MEDINA Fine. 

01:16:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay? 

01:16:50
NELSON MEDINA Sounds good. 

01:16:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right. 

01:16:50
ADAM L. BENSON Yeah. 

01:16:50
NELSON MEDINA I'm glad we came here. 

01:16:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Terrific, terrific. Well, I'm really pleased too. Like I said, as far as I know, overtly, you're the first; covertly, I'm sure that you're not, and I will do everything that I can, stay in touch with me throughout the year, and I look forward to meeting your daughter very soon, ah, and we'll take it from there. 

01:17:05
ADAM L. BENSON Great. 

01:17:05
SCENARIO SIX DEVELOPING LBGT COMMUNITY; LESBIAN TEACHER COMING OUT AND ACTIVISM ISSUES 

01:17:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay, this final scenario is reflective of the last stage of the model, which is developing a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Uhm, Kate is a teacher in the school where I work, uhm, who has self-identified as lesbian. She's in a partnered relationship, and she knows that I'm a safe, affirming person so she, she has come to me, ah, to share some, uhm, issues she has and some current concerns about whether she should or can't come out at school because in her outside life, her non-professional life, she was very out and active in the, ah, lesbian, gay and transgender, ah, bisexual transgender community. Kate, I'm, ah, glad you stopped by. You had some concerns about, uhm, whether or not you should come out at school. Can you tell me a little bit more about - 

01:18:15
KATE HOWELL Yeah, uhm, 

01:18:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - what, what's behind to that? 

01:18:15
KATE HOWELL Uhm, I'm kind of, uhm, coming today to talk to you because of some problems that are going on in my outside life that are now going to, uhm, come to, I had, really - 

01:18:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:18:30
KATE HOWELL - whether I like them or not and it's how I'm going to handle them that I need the, 

01:18:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:18:35
KATE HOWELL the most help. Uhm, I'm very active in my, ah, outside community and - 

01:18:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:18:40
KATE HOWELL - and outside the school system, uhm, especially within the, the lesbian community that myself and my partner are involved in. 

01:18:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:18:50
KATE HOWELL And uhm, I've been very afraid to come out into the school and, uhm, come out to the school and to my staff members. I'm afraid of the ramifications that it might have on my job. 

01:19:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

01:19:05
KATE HOWELL Uhm and, ah, my role as a teacher within - 

01:19:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:19:10
KATE HOWELL - this school system which, uhm, which is a big issue for me because I've been here for a long time. 

01:19:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:19:15
KATE HOWELL Uhm, on the opposite end of it ah, my partner would really like me to come fully out - 

01:19:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:19:25
KATE HOWELL - to ah, to everyone, and I think I would like so. 

01:19:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ By fully out you mean this in all spheres of your life. 

01:19:30
KATE HOWELL Se, everyone. Yes, yeah, and uhm, I think I would like to do that just to stop the conflict - 

01:19:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:19:40
KATE HOWELL - between my, it's like I'm living two lives. 

01:19:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:19:45
KATE HOWELL Uhm, but like I said I'm afraid - 

01:19:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:19:45
KATE HOWELL - to do it, and uhm, now my, my partner and I are sharing a wonderful moment in our lives. She's pregnant, and - 

01:19:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Oh, congratulations, huh. 

01:19:55
KATE HOWELL - thanks. Thank you. And, uhm, I can't share it with, I can't share her having morning sickness. I can't share the, uhm, pictures on the ultrasound. 

01:20:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:20:05
KATE HOWELL I can't have pictures on my desk of my child. And I know that - 

01:20:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:20:15
KATE HOWELL - if I choose to do this, I'm going to have to, 

01:20:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:20:15
KATE HOWELL I'm going to have to - 

01:20:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:20:15
KATE HOWELL - let it out. So, and she's getting very frustrated at home - 

01:20:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:20:20
KATE HOWELL - because I'm not sharing this. 

01:20:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. But now, obviously, I can't, you know, make a decision for you. 

01:20:25
KATE HOWELL Uh-hmm. 

01:20:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ And since I'm your colleague, I can't, you know, do so much counseling around that I might encourage you to, ah, get some counseling around some of the harder, ah, personal issues about that. But as a colleague and an ally, I would like to, uhm, help you explore some of the fears and some of the ways that, ah, I can test, help you test the waters in terms of if you decide to, to come out more. Ah, when, when is your child due? 

01:21:00
KATE HOWELL She, well, we don't know if it's a she or he yet. 

01:21:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:21:00
KATE HOWELL It's a little bit early but, uhm, I'm, I'm guessing about seven months. 

01:21:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:21:05
KATE HOWELL Yeah. 

01:21:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So, you have roughly seven months to kind of - 

01:21:10
KATE HOWELL Uh-hmm. 

01:21:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - make a decision at, at least around this one a, aspect of your life. I mean, obviously, if you choose to stay of in the closet and not have that community he, here at work, you have obviously, there's still the di, dichotomy that you have been living, but you have all those things that you've, you've raised. 

01:21:30
KATE HOWELL Uh-hmm. 

01:21:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ What are some of your biggest fears and what if, what are some of your, uhm, concerns or even positive ideas of have, about how certain faculty or administrators, parents, students may react, ah, to you? 

01:21:45
KATE HOWELL Well, these are very, uhm, the parents that I've been dealing with are very conservative. Uhm, some of the, the newer staff, they, who have just come out - 

01:21:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:22:00
KATE HOWELL - are a little bit more open, uhm, to a realm of possibilities - 

01:22:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:22:05
KATE HOWELL - for me that the older, more tenured individuals, uhm, are not at all and that, uhm, and for the administration - 

01:22:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:22:15
KATE HOWELL - from what I've seen over, you know, the last few years, it's, it's ah, it's a tough club. 

01:22:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:22:20
KATE HOWELL And I'm very afraid that if they find out that, ah, that I am a lesbian in the life partner relationship with a child, that there's going to be a lot of pressure. 

01:22:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ What do you, what do you think some of those repercussions of that pressure might be? 

01:22:45
KATE HOWELL That they take away some of my, uhm, extra-curricular activities with the students. 

01:22:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:22:50
KATE HOWELL And, and the sports. 

01:22:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:22:50
KATE HOWELL And, uhm, and doing like the drama club - 

01:22:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

01:22:55
KATE HOWELL - and, and I'm afraid I'm gonna lose that and, 

01:22:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:23:00
KATE HOWELL and, and from that, which they can take away from me. 

01:23:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:23:00
KATE HOWELL Uhm, and in doing that, the students themselves - 

01:23:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:23:05
KATE HOWELL - are going to know - 

01:23:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:23:05
KATE HOWELL - uhm, one way or another, I mean, the way gossip travels in the school. 

01:23:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:23:10
KATE HOWELL And I'm afraid that this, I will lose my rapport with those students that I've worked - 

01:23:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:23:15
KATE HOWELL - really hard - 

01:23:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:23:15
KATE HOWELL - with them. 

01:23:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So it's, so it sounds like, right now, you're concerned about losing some of the additional duties that you do here and some of the rapport that you have with students. Ah, are you also concerned about losing your job? Or if you, it would be tensed but that probably won't happen. 

01:23:35
KATE HOWELL Well, I'm with the, with the, uhm, teachers' union. I'm very comfortable that they would, they would back me up. 

01:23:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. There is a cause, I guess. 

01:23:40
KATE HOWELL Uhm, yeah, and, uhm, so, for that, but I mean, to tell you the truth, it's a battle I just don't wanna strip myself of everything I have - 

01:23:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:23:50
KATE HOWELL - to have. 

01:23:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:23:55
KATE HOWELL And I don't know if I'm prepared for that battle. 

01:23:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:23:55
KATE HOWELL But at the same time, I'm scared I'm gonna - 

01:23:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:24:00
KATE HOWELL - have a bigger battle at home - 

01:24:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:24:00
KATE HOWELL - and, and lose the woman that I love and my child - 

01:24:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:24:05
KATE HOWELL in some way or form of an, you know, one way - 

01:24:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:24:05
KATE HOWELL - or another - 

01:24:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:24:05
KATE HOWELL - if I don't. 

01:24:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ By, uhm, being more out at, at school, how do you see that enhancing your life and therefore, uhm, enhancing your teaching? 

01:24:20
KATE HOWELL Well, I think, I will be more comfortable with - 

01:24:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:24:25
KATE HOWELL - with myself. Uhm, I think that, uhm, by empowering myself to come out - 

01:24:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:24:30
KATE HOWELL - and, and let myself, uhm, not have these split lives - 

01:24:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:24:35
KATE HOWELL - that my lives can now join one another. 

01:24:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:24:40
KATE HOWELL And, and I can be stronger because I have the strength of my family - 

01:24:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:24:45
KATE HOWELL - behind me. 

01:24:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:24:45
KATE HOWELL Uhm, and, and that I think can only benefit me. I think also it, whatever benefits to the students - 

01:24:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:24:50
KATE HOWELL - who are going through maybe some of the same life changes or, 

01:24:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:24:55
KATE HOWELL or, uhm, they, they'll be able to talk with me - 

01:25:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:25:00
KATE HOWELL - more openly. Uhm, and I don't wanna maybe use the word, the words, "role model" - 

01:25:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:25:05
KATE HOWELL - but something similar to that. 

01:25:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:25:10
KATE HOWELL Uhm, and I would be seen as a safe zone to them. 

01:25:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. So it sounds like, while you have some concerns, there are some definite strengths or positives that you can see by coming out that will. 

01:25:20
KATE HOWELL Uh-hmm. 

01:25:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ In fact, make you a more effective teacher which maybe then the administrators can respond to and say, "Well, gee," you know, "well, Kate's job is actually, im-- improved." I think, you know - 

01:25:35
KATE HOWELL Yeah. 

01:25:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - you still have some exploring to do and, you know, I can give you some, ah, referrals, uhm, for who you might do that exploring with. But I also want to reiterate that as a, ah, an affirming, ah, person in this school system, that I too can test the waters. I too can reach out to administrators and begin to ask them what, the "what if's" or "how to" or "what would happen" or you know, address some of their concerns with some real knowledge versus myths which oftentimes fuel the fears which is where we oftentimes see the parents and, ah, coming with concerns about their children. Uhm, we don't usually see that so much from the children but sometimes we do and I would be happy to, you know, do some, some guidance pieces in those classes, ah, you know, about sexuality, sexual identity, uhm, you know, those kinds of things. But then, you're not alone and you don't have to step out, uhm, by yourself, I think. Uhm, you know, by you coming here, that's one step, one connection already that says, "I'm beginning to develop a community." 

01:26:45
KATE HOWELL Right. 

01:26:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So, uhm, is there any, anything else that you'd like? 

01:26:50
KATE HOWELL No, that, I mean, that's the, the biggest step I guess is the - 

01:26:55
KATE HOWELL Okay. 

01:26:55
KATE HOWELL - first step for me, yeah. 

01:26:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay. Well, if it's okay with you, then, I'll, sort of, begin to send, send some feelers out around it, you know, different administrators and different folks. 

01:27:00
KATE HOWELL Yeah, I'd really appreciate that, yeah. 

01:27:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay. Thanks, Kate. 

01:27:05
KATE HOWELL Thank you.

01:28:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES In the first scenario we have a couple who is coming to my school counseling office because they have recently suddenly transfer their daughter into our school and they are quite concerned about, ah, at the former school their daughter was outed as a lesbian by their attendance counselor. And they're quite upset, ah, they were embarrassed in front of friends, and family and neighbors and want the counselor to assist them to ensure that, that won't occur in this school. Well welcome, ah, how can I be of assistance to you all today? 

01:29:30
THERESA WYRE We'll we are here because I, well let me explain to what happen at the last school. I went there to find out some information about my daughters attendance - 

01:29:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:29:40
THERESA WYRE - because we're receiving cut card and she was attending school. 

01:29:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:29:45
THERESA WYRE When I got there the attendance officer told me that my daughter was a lesbian and was prancing around the school with another female student. 

01:29:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:29:55
THERESA WYRE So of course I was furious I immediately withdraw her from the school and that's why we place her in this school. 

01:30:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right. Well I'm glad that you 're here although it must have been a tremendous shock, you must been very worried and initially being angry finding out such an important information about your daughter. 

01:30:10
THERESA WYRE Yes, I'm, I'm furious. I am absolutely furious. 

01:30:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. And dad how about you? 

01:30:20
UNKNOWN Well, ah, of course I'm sad about it but little girls will be little girls. 

01:30:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:30:30
UNKNOWN I love my little girl she's gonna be like that but I also think this is just a phase she is going through. 

01:30:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:30:35
THERESA WYRE A phase? You think this is just a phase? 

01:30:40
UNKNOWN I do think so. 

01:30:40
THERESA WYRE It's ridiculous, how-- first of all how do they allow the student to prance around the schools? Female and female? That craziness. I, I'm hoping that we don't have this problem in this school. 

01:30:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. So one of the things that you are looking for is to find out about what do school counselors, what the teachers do in this school? What are the kids like in this school? Things like that. What kind of an environment is there in this school? 

01:31:00
THERESA WYRE Yes. 

01:31:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES And what would be different from them. 

01:31:05
THERESA WYRE Yes. 

01:31:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right. 

01:31:05
THERESA WYRE Because we were humiliated, I was completely embarrassed, everyone in the community knows about this, the parents, ooh! 

01:31:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES That sounds horrible. Before we do that and talk about the school I'd like to find out a little bit more about you all. Tell me about your ethnicities, your religious, your cultural identities so I got an idea of the values and beliefs that you were from as a family. 

01:31:25
UNKNOWN Well I'm a Rastafarian, uhm, I'm a Rastafari as my religion - 

01:31:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:31:30
UNKNOWN - very strongly. And we don't abide by lesbians or gays. 

01:31:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:31:40
UNKNOWN But for now that's what my daughter is and as I said before she's gonna change. And I know she is, she talks to me - 

01:31:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:31:45
UNKNOWN - she's daddy's little girl of course. 

01:31:45
THERESA WYRE She talks to you, she didn't say anything to me. 

01:31:50
UNKNOWN Cause you're... 

01:31:50
THERESA WYRE I sit there and I talk and I ask a question and she just sits there. What did she say to you? 

01:31:55
UNKNOWN She tell me everything, cause you're always mean to her. I'm the one who sit and calm her, who talks to her. 

01:32:00
THERESA WYRE I am concerned, I am not mean I am concerned. 

01:32:05
UNKNOWN So did you come to me now? 

01:32:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Sounds like you both are really worried and frightened about what's going with your daughter, is that correct? 

01:32:15
UNKNOWN Yes, we are. 

01:32:15
THERESA WYRE Yes. 

01:32:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah, okay, and tell me about your ethnicity and your religious identity similar to your husbands? 

01:32:20
THERESA WYRE Ah, somewhat similar I am from West Indian background my parents are from Saint Kitts. 

01:32:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:32:25
THERESA WYRE And they are very strict. 

01:32:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:32:30
THERESA WYRE They do not tolerate any type of homosexual behavior and I am not either. 

01:32:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Okay. So what you're looking for at this point is a school were your daughter won't encounter any other kids or anyone that live and talk about being lesbian or gay. 

01:32:45
THERESA WYRE And that would be my preference, yes. 

01:32:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, all right. So one of the things that I need to say is that this is a school about of support and of affirming of all people and we have a state school statement I'd like to give you a copy of that document. Ah, do you know what I'm talking about? What a state school is? 

01:33:00
THERESA WYRE No. 

01:33:00
UNKNOWN No. 

01:33:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right. The state school statement basically says that this is a school that is affirming of all people across different culture identities. And so we'll do everything we can to be affirming of your daughter, however, there are students in this school who identify as lesbian and gay and there is no way that a teacher or a counselor or principal can stop students from interacting. That's true in any school. So I wanna be honest with you that I'm happy to support you from the values that you're at but in the public school environment there is no physical way and it wouldn't be ethical at this point to separate your daughter from other students. 

01:33:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible )? 

01:33:41
THERESA WYRE So you're telling me that this can happen again? 

01:33:41
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. I know it doesn't feel good, I sure that makes you really angry. 

01:33:50
THERESA WYRE Ah, ah... 

01:33:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Let me check out, does it? Is that make you mad? 

01:33:50
THERESA WYRE It makes me very angry. 

01:33:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. We'll think about this this way, we can control certain things in school grounds but what did happens when she leaves school? You know what I'm saying? So, what we can do at this point and what I'd love to offer you is to work with you as a family and how you work with your daughter at this point in terms of who she is. Would you be open to that? 

01:34:20
THERESA WYRE Yes. 

01:34:20
UNKNOWN I am very much open to that. 

01:34:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, what did your daughter say during this whole horribly embarrassing situation for this family? 

01:34:30
THERESA WYRE She like, I say, she doesn't say anything to me. I speak to her and she just sit there and says absolutely nothing but ask Ronnie, he must know she talks to him. 

01:34:45
UNKNOWN She has told me about couple other guys she has in counted dated so I know she is gonna change sooner or later. 

01:34:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, so she talks to you - 

01:34:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:34:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES - at this point. And when she talks to you she has shared about guys that she has dated in the past. 

01:35:00
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:35:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES And sounds like you thought as, well she has done in the past and sure will she can do in the future. 

01:35:05
UNKNOWN Of course. 

01:35:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES And sounds like you're not getting anything right? So it's like you talk and she doesn't say anything back. 

01:35:10
THERESA WYRE She doesn't say anything. 

01:35:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES So one of the things that I'd like to offer is the chance to be a facilitator, a helper for this family to help you dialogue together so that mom and daughter can talk, so that, ah, father and daughter can talk and, ah, you can really hear where she coming from what's going on? 

01:35:25
UNKNOWN All right then. 

01:35:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES I'd like to offer that, all right. However, uhm, it sounds to me also like you feeling very disappointed, uhm, I look through her file she's got like straight As, uhm, and it sounds like you've got real hope and dreams for her academically, career wise? 

01:35:45
UNKNOWN Yes, we do. 

01:35:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, tell me about where you'd like to see her, what kind of job or, what kinda like? 

01:35:50
UNKNOWN Well she have spoken to me about being a doctor. 

01:35:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:35:55
UNKNOWN And I'm loving that, I love to hear how she talk about that. And she so brilliant I just know she's gonna become, yes, gonna be doctor. 

01:36:00
THERESA WYRE How is she going to be a doctor when she is running around talking about she's a lesbian? 

01:36:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES So its like at this point it's like all you can see is your daughter is a lesbian and what I'm hearing is that - 

01:36:15
THERESA WYRE Did-- can you imagine how much ridicule she'll have to encounter? I'm, I'm feeling fearful for her. 

01:36:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, okay. I really appreciate you sharing that cause it sounds like there's a tremendous amount of fear on, on it the anger about what kind of a life is she gonna have? You have this wonderful hopes and dreams for her, career wise, academics but it sounds like your image of her in terms of your daughter it's like the picture frame the picture has shattered. That be fair though, you know what I'm saying? 

01:36:45
THERESA WYRE Yes, yes. 

01:36:45
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

01:36:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES And so at this point I encourage you all to pick up the pieces together as a family unit and I-- and talk with you and help you talk with each other about that. 

01:36:55
UNKNOWN That be nice. 

01:36:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. Is there anything else that I could help with today? 

01:37:00
THERESA WYRE No. 

01:37:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. Do you any other adults to talk to about when a child or adolescent comes out as lesbian or gay? 

01:37:10
UNKNOWN No, we don't. 

01:37:10
THERESA WYRE And, and there are, there are other people like experiencing this problem? 

01:37:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah. Uh-hmm. 

01:37:15
THERESA WYRE Well. 

01:37:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES So it sounds like you feel pretty alone and isolated right now. 

01:37:20
THERESA WYRE Yes. 

01:37:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES That be accurate? Yeah. I would like to offer you the chance either online or I can give you phone numbers to the local group is called parents and friends of lesbians and gays. Its a group of adults who, uhm, support each other when their children come out of the closet as lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender. And again at this point I haven't met your daughter, I don't know how she identifies and what's going on. But if indeed she is clear at who she is, uhm, this group could be extremely helpful to the two of you to help you break your isolation and the pain that you're feeling right now. 

01:37:50
UNKNOWN That be very nice. 

01:37:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES And, ah, in the city, in the suburbs the chapters that I'm aware of, uhm, our folks have different religious, different ethnic, racial identities. You don't have to feel all alone in terms of, ah, oh, its, its all one type of person. Yeah. So why don't I give, ah, referrals for that to ask you to check in, you could also check in online, I'll give you a website, uhm, are you open to doing them? 

01:38:15
UNKNOWN I am. 

01:38:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:38:15
THERESA WYRE Yes, I suppose. 

01:38:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, maybe its easy to negotiate which one of you would like to do that. And then why don't we set another time to meet and I'll ask you to come in with your daughter at that point in time. Okay? 

01:38:30
UNKNOWN Oh, that be very nice. 

01:38:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. Anything else how this time has been today? 

01:38:35
THERESA WYRE No. 

01:38:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES No, okay. Uhm, please do call me within the week because I'm certainly concerned of anything changes and I wanna be a support of this possible for all of you. 

01:38:45
UNKNOWN I definitely call you and let you know. 

01:38:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Great. 

01:38:50
UNKNOWN All right. 

01:38:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:38:50
THERESA WYRE Thanks. 

01:38:55
SECOND SCENARIO ASSISTING A MALE STUDENT WHO'S BEING EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY HARASSED IN SCHOOL AND CONTEMPLATIN SUICIDE 

01:39:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ In this scenario a student has sought me out for, uhm, guidance I'm not his assigned guidance counselor but because of the affirming of items in my office he felt like I was a safe place to go. Uhm, Jerry is of Chinese ethnicity and background. He, ah, self-identifies as, uhm, let's say Chinese male right now. However students have physically, ah, assaulted him to some degree writing of things such as a fag, queer, ah, those kinds of things on his jacket. Jerry having some sobby(ph) has, ah, knew what it down to who he thinks he's might be, he had his jacket dry cleaned worked to another class, uhm, and then behold after that class, something appeared on the back of his coat. So he is coming to me with coat immediately after that class, and what I need to do is try to deal with how do I help Jerry cope with this issue not, and not be his assigned guidance counselor. 

01:40:20
JERRY HSIEH So they did it again this is the third time this week. I don't know what to do, I mean, they keep writing fag and those things on my jacket. 

01:40:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

01:40:25
JERRY HSIEH I, I feel like I can't take it anymore. 

01:40:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. I can hear your-- I can hear anger and your frustration but, uhm, you know, since you're not one of, ah, my students do we could just back off a little bit, if I can get a little of, you know, knowledge about you. 

01:40:45
JERRY HSIEH Okay. 

01:40:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uhm, ah, how do you identify yourself in terms of, or, or do you at this point have a sense of who you are with your sexual identity. 

01:40:55
JERRY HSIEH Well, I, I think I'm gay but I'm not sure. 

01:41:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So not sure. Uh-hmm. But it seems like the other kids who have somehow pin this on you. 

01:41:05
JERRY HSIEH Yeah, I think they, they think I'm gay, I don't know why but... 

01:41:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

01:41:10
JERRY HSIEH I never tell anyone or, you know, would did anything with anybody but I don't know it happen. 

01:41:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. So you haven't done, ah, in, in your eyes you haven't done anything blatant, you know, hold anybody's hand or else anything - 

01:41:25
JERRY HSIEH No, not in school. 

01:41:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - advance or, you know, anything like that? Uhm, but for some reason kids are picking up on, you know, your sort of non-traditional Chinese, you, you're not an athlete, you're, ah - 

01:41:40
JERRY HSIEH Yeah. 

01:41:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - very intelligent - 

01:41:45
JERRY HSIEH Uh-hmm. 

01:41:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - and for whatever reasons that picking out. 

01:41:45

01:41:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

01:41:50

01:41:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:41:55
JERRY HSIEH People keep teasing me. 

01:41:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Ah, I wanna, a, a little bit, ah, about how you, ah, I understand you, you want how do I fix this problem? And I, I don't blame you for, for wanting to, to get to that point. 

01:42:05
JERRY HSIEH Okay. 

01:42:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ But I don't care just to, uhm, how you, ah, sought me out, ah, because you do have another guidance counselor and would like to, uhm, be that bridge - 

01:42:15
JERRY HSIEH Uh-hmm. 

01:42:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - uhm. 

01:42:20
JERRY HSIEH Because I'd know you're a lesbian. 

01:42:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:42:20
JERRY HSIEH And I feel maybe for me its more comfortable talking to you - 

01:42:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Just feel more safe. 

01:42:25
JERRY HSIEH - than a straight counselor. 

01:42:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:42:30
JERRY HSIEH That's why I'm here today. 

01:42:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Do you have some fear that your counselor might judge you? 

01:42:35
JERRY HSIEH Yes. 

01:42:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:42:35
JERRY HSIEH And I don't want them to, you know - 

01:42:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:42:40
JERRY HSIEH - tell the different point of view of me-- who I am. 

01:42:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So you're afraid of, your guidance counselor will have a, a, a critical bias judgment against you, as well as I'm fine to deal with this and what do you think, ah, he, how he may respond in terms of, ah, what's being, ah, written on your coat. 

01:43:05
JERRY HSIEH Hmm, uhm, maybe I don't know you'll think I'm, gay and you'll tell my parents I don't know want that happen. 

01:43:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So you're afraid he'll-- what he'll tell your parents. Ah, are you afraid about other things that he might do? 

01:43:20
JERRY HSIEH Or even tell the students, uhm. 

01:43:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. So you have concerns about he, he might tell the students, he may talk, uhm, he might straight its a bit and you can correct me if I'm wrong. Strai-- ah, he might tell other teachers, and maybe be seem how he way talk about you. 

01:43:40
JERRY HSIEH Yes. 

01:43:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ And that also an attack on who you are as a, as a person. 

01:43:45
JERRY HSIEH Yes. 

01:43:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ And, as a lesbian person you thought well at least she had on something, yeah. 

01:43:50
JERRY HSIEH Cause I know you have been through this before so that's one mere. 

01:43:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Yeah, so how can, how can she help me out? First of all I want to acknowledge the, the struggle - 

01:44:00
JERRY HSIEH Uh-hmm. 

01:44:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - that you are going through and that it, that is real and that is uncomfortable. Its hurtful, uhm, at the same time where you-- when you try to figure out what your sexual identity as who you are - 

01:44:10
JERRY HSIEH Uh-hmm. 

01:44:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - in terms of your sexual identity. At the same time I wa-- I do want you to know that I am an ally and I can, uhm, reach out and try to be the bridge and I really think, ah, we do have, ah, zero tolerance class in this school however its I'm sure you're well aware hasn't had a great deal impact for you personally - 

01:44:30
JERRY HSIEH Uh-hmm. 

01:44:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - because this is happening, you were, you know, the first time that happen that you think, uhm, ah, you, you told me quickly that how it at one day that its happening and you, you know you wear a coat for the rest of day, no one else said anything. 

01:44:45
JERRY HSIEH Yeah, I, I don't know and everyone was laughing behind me. 

01:44:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:44:50
JERRY HSIEH And I was so embarrassed and I feel like killing myself. 

01:44:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Can, can you, ah, elaborate more about how you feel like hurting yourself? 

01:45:00
JERRY HSIEH Because I feel like coming to school, I feel so alone and people were laughing behind me and I don't know why - 

01:45:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:45:05
JERRY HSIEH - or just because I'm gay and people laugh at me? 

01:45:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. Oh, yeah, I just, just wanna address that issue by doing and take a minute to, to, ah, ah, assess, you know, where you're at in terms of hurting yourself. Uhm, do you feel like if this continues I might kill myself tomorrow, I mean, have you given this a lot of thought? Do you have it planned or? 

01:45:35
JERRY HSIEH I don't know maybe after transferred to another school or... 

01:45:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay, so right now its a, its, its a fact but it seems like it is somewhat ambiguous thought. 

01:45:45
JERRY HSIEH Yes. 

01:45:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ There are the options like to transfer in another school or whether stop. 

01:45:45
JERRY HSIEH Yeah. 

01:45:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ And part being, you want this to stop. 

01:45:50
JERRY HSIEH Yes, I want it to stop. 

01:45:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay, I would be willing to talk to your teachers to say this needs to stop and to remind people that we do have this, this classroom policy about zero tolerance regarding, uhm, you know, people who are from different, ah, socioeconomic backgrounds, different cultures, ethnicities, races, social orientation and that we need to support that. And it was quite case its not being supported and if not we need to explore that, you know, as, ah, faculty and administration. Again the end result the behavior and the other person has to stop. 

01:46:30
JERRY HSIEH Uh-hmm. 

01:46:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ But I also want to be a bridge for you and your guidance counselor as that you can feel safe to explore some of the personal things that you are going through, am I gay? 

01:46:45
JERRY HSIEH Uh-hmm. 

01:46:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ What's happening to me? Do I feel suicidal? Do I wanna out of this? What's the e-- what are other possible ramifications. And that this is extremely hurtful. Ah, I-- you're a victim of violence right now, and that cannot feel good. 

01:47:00
JERRY HSIEH I know. So... 

01:47:05
< sp>Lynn Haley-Banez Would is-- would it be okay if I talk to some of this other folks and particularly in this one classroom or we have a good idea where this is happening? 

01:47:15
JERRY HSIEH Sure, sure. 

01:47:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So that's okay? 

01:47:20
JERRY HSIEH Yes. 

01:47:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Right. 

01:47:20
JERRY HSIEH Thank you very much. 

01:47:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:47:25

01:47:25
THIRD SCENARIO CONSULTING WITH A HETEROSEXUAL TEACHER ABOUT TO AFFIRM A LESBIAN ADOLESCENT WHO HAS COME OUT REGARDING A RELATIONSHIP 

01:47:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES In this scenario we wanna give an example of the important role of consultation for school and family counselor. Ah, heterosexual identified teacher of Puerto Rican ethnicity has come to the school counselor because he has just had a, ah, Puerto Rican lesbian student come out and she is dealing with her relationship issue with another girl that she is dating in the school. And this wonderful teacher has had no training in what to do with sexual orientation in the classroom. And so he has come to talk with school counselor about what he needs to do and how to respond in this situation. Hey, Nelson how you doing? 

01:48:15
NELSON MEDINA Pretty good Stuart, how you been? 

01:48:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, I been fine, you know, busy as can be but hanging in there so I got your message that you want to talk. What's going on? 

01:48:20
NELSON MEDINA Recently I had a student that came up to me, uhm, she just drop the (inaudible ) and, and I really don't know how to, how to take care of the situation. She just came up to me and tell me, she was lesbian. I mean, there were rumors in the school that she was lesbian and I seen her playing around with some other girl, you know, holding hand but, you know, I didn't figure anything about it. 

01:48:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:48:40
NELSON MEDINA But she just came up to me, and she's a wonderful kid. Wonderful kid I mean, she's a wonderful student of great personality - 

01:48:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:48:50
NELSON MEDINA - and she just drop the bomb and tell me she was a lesbian. Now, you know, I'm, I'm cool with the, the gay issues and the lesbian issues but she just had a, a problem, she, she wasn't sure whether she wanted to keep dating girls and that or she wanted to date this specific young lady. 

01:49:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:49:05
NELSON MEDINA Okay, uhm, I guess she identified with me because I'm also Puerto Rican and she is Puerto Rican. 

01:49:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

01:49:10
NELSON MEDINA But I don't know what to do. And you really gotta help me out so because, uhm, they didn't teach me this in teaching training ed. And, and I really didn't expect this to come on in, in, in my job. You know, I didn't know what to do. So I figured since you are, you know, pretty open with your, uhm, sexuality in this school, you know, you're gay and, and I'm not gay and I've never dealt with the, the, this type of situation I figured that and come to you. You're a great person I know that you're gonna give me good advice. 

01:49:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Oh, well, I'll do what I can thank you. Ah, I guess the first thing is, ah, say thanks for dropping by because as far as I know I'm the only gay identified person in this school so, uhm, you're not the first then assume won't be the last when someone like this goes on to come to see me which you're doing the right thing. 

01:49:55
NELSON MEDINA All right. 

01:49:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Because you're so right. Most heterosexual focus don't quite know what to do, you know, you've got a reputation as being one of the best teachers in this school, all the, all the kids love you, can talk to you. 

01:50:05
NELSON MEDINA I try my best. 

01:50:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES But it sounds like it's the first time that someone has come talk to you about the issue of like being a lesbian and being a teenager. So, I could see why you'd be, you know, not quite sure about what to say and what to do. 

01:50:15
NELSON MEDINA Yeah. 

01:50:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES So, so, give me a little bit more information about this particular young woman and what the scenario is that she's into. 

01:50:20
NELSON MEDINA Well she's a, she's senior to school. 

01:50:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:50:25
NELSON MEDINA Uhm, she is feminine, you know, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't pick up on it. I'd really didn't pick up on, uhm, she told me that she, she has this desire to be a woman, to be a girl her own age, ah, she is very friendly with them, she, she I guess she is, I don't know if she is falling in love or she is just wanting a relationship with a young lady, and she not sure she wants to be with that particu-- that particular young lady. And though she just confronted me, uhm, I don't know what to do, I mean I don't know, I, I mean, I don't know what it is to have a gay-- a relationship or a lesbian relationship because I am not a gay, you are in my rela-- ah, a lesbian. So I don't know what to do. Tell me Stuart, what should I do? 

01:51:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Sure. Well, I get my role, I can't necessarily tell you what to do but let me at least try and help you figure out the choices that you have and, and how to make the decisions you're on helping her. Ah, I-- let say that first thing would be, ah, what do you know about being lesbian? You know anything? 

01:51:25
NELSON MEDINA To me as far as I'm concern being a lesbian is just a woman in another woman. Ah, I thought being a lesbian means being a, rough, you know - 

01:51:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Oh! 

01:51:35
NELSON MEDINA - like (inaudible ) this what I thought a lesbian was. 

01:51:36
STUART CHEN-HAYES So here was this like pretty fun student, you never really have guess. 

01:51:40
NELSON MEDINA Bring me off. 

01:51:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Because she didn't match your image of what it meant to be a lesbian. 

01:51:45
NELSON MEDINA Not at all. 

01:51:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES So that, that like really blew you away. 

01:51:45
NELSON MEDINA Oh, yeah. 

01:51:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES That's number one. So one thing that you can do is really look at I need to maybe read some stuff about lesbians or gonna be about the variety because, you know, there's many different lesbians, cuz there are gay people or heterosexuals, and folks are really different. But if we don't have the information we often, ah, fall back in this stereotypes. I think the second piece is, ah, what happens during adolescents for people of any sexual orientation, developmentally. 

01:52:10
NELSON MEDINA You know what at this point I'm confuse, I, I just have this girl on my head I don't know what to think anymore. 

01:52:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:52:15
NELSON MEDINA I mean I know they are going through a lot of problems when it comes to exams, she is a senior now she had to think about what class she wants to get into, uhm... 

01:52:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES But that the reason she came to you. 

01:52:25
NELSON MEDINA Oh, no, no, no she get exploring relationship. 

01:52:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Exactly. 

01:52:25
NELSON MEDINA She's exploring... 

01:52:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES So all that adolescents the task of adolescent development that we know is to look at exploring dating relationship sexuality. So she has a whole lot in common with every other adolescent at the school about that. The differences at this point she is interested in exploring dating other girls. And that's what we need to get you, ah, accurate and appropriate information. So it also sounded like she is not comfortable or sure that this other girl that she is dating is the one. 

01:52:55
NELSON MEDINA Right, and I don't know what to tell her. 

01:52:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Right. Well, one of the first and so I ask is does anyone else know in your circle of friends? 

01:53:00
NELSON MEDINA No. Being since she confided in me I, I kept that confidential between her and myself. 

01:53:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:53:05
NELSON MEDINA Uhm, I did tell her that I was gonna consult another stuff member at the school and, and, and she said she was fine with that. So that's why... 

01:53:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES And tell her that was a school counselor, a personnel, or teacher or? 

01:53:15
NELSON MEDINA Yeah, I told her it was a school counselor that's probably, ah... 

01:53:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Did you tell her it was me directly or? Cause I don't know, I don't know what she knows about me or not. 

01:53:20
NELSON MEDINA Ah, well I didn't tell her because I didn't know if you wanted me to le-- tell, tell her. 

01:53:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES That'll be fine. 

01:53:25
NELSON MEDINA So I, I didn't really specify who I was gonna confront. 

01:53:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:53:25
NELSON MEDINA Uhm, but I did tell her I was gonna speak to someone whom knows a little bit more about the matter. 

01:53:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Great, okay. That's what I like you to do when you talk with her again and say that you spoke with me and that she is welcome to come by talk with me at any point in time sometimes because I'm out lesbian, bisexual gay, transgendered students that we have sometimes don't wanna talk to me cause they're fearful that others will associate them as, aah! That's the gay school counselor can't go talk to him, but then there are other lesbian, gay, and bisexual transgendered students who will come to me in a minute and feel very safe. I wonder too some of the youth have talked about they'd like to see us as a school stirred up a, uhm, lesbian bisexual gay transgender youth support group. And for variety reasons I haven't had the chance to develop something like that. I wonder upon talking with her, uhm, if you might be interested in the system or something like that or - 

01:54:15
NELSON MEDINA Absolutely. 

01:54:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES - like the way to, to help other folks, uhm, so that I'm not the one who is doing all the work but at the same time I could be very supportive and, and help out whatever possible. 

01:54:25
NELSON MEDINA This is a very smart young woman, she is very out-going. 

01:54:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:54:25
NELSON MEDINA Uhm, I need to be trained because of course there are I'm sure that she not the only gay students in the school, the only lesbian student at school. I'm sure there are lot more. I love all my students. 

01:54:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

01:54:35
NELSON MEDINA And what I can do to help - 

01:54:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Great. 

01:54:35
NELSON MEDINA - I'll be more than happy to, to work with you. 

01:54:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES I really wanna complement you, its that openness that caring attitude to me that shows your abilities as a professional teacher. And I guess what I also like to offer is maybe we can go to the principal for years I wanted to do this again for whatever reasons that hasn't happened and do a series of teacher trainings in the school and for administrators about how to work affectively with lesbian, bisexual, gay, transgendered youth. Again you know the politics on our system its really crazy it pretty conservative, so that be pretty careful. But if we got students now approaching people other than me in the school, that tells me that something shifted or that its time to go ahead and, and, do that. 

01:55:15
NELSON MEDINA Absolutely. 

01:55:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES So I have a whole series of resources that I'll give to you about how to work with lesbian youth things like that. Well, I think what I encouraged you to do, uhm, is sounds like you'll talk with the student again - 

01:55:25
NELSON MEDINA Sure. 

01:55:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES - find out what's going on, offer she can continue to talk to you, but then you're also not a professional counselor she wants to come see me I mean I'm happy to do that, ah, but she doesn't have to. Uhm, and then once you've talked, how about you did me a call back or visit me, ah, and we'll go for meeting. 

01:55:40
NELSON MEDINA It's all about choices, I don't given a choices and just let her take it from there and then I let you know. 

01:55:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES I couldn't have said better myself. 

01:55:45
NELSON MEDINA Right. 

01:55:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Great. Thank you. 

01:55:50
SCENARIO FOUR COUNSELING A TRANSGENDERED YOUTH DEALING WITH EMOTIONAL ABUSE AND A SUICIDE ATTEMPT 

01:55:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Well, in this scenario as a school counselor I am working with a transgendered youth, a self-identified transgender youth, girl to boy, uhm, who has just gone through, uhm, ah, recent still a major depression but has attempted suicide so she has spent some time, uhm, being hospitalized and now is returning to school and has some, ah, issues in which he would like to talk to me about. Lisa, uhm, I, I know that you've, ah, had a, a previous counselor who has talked to you about some of this issues but I'm curious as to what's happening for you since you've come back to school. 

01:56:45
KRISPIN MATTHEW Well first of all I kinda like to be, uhm, called Kris. 

01:56:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Kris, okay. 

01:56:50
KRISPIN MATTHEW Just kind any legal, right. 

01:56:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Yeah, cuz your paper works said Lisa, I'll be sure to change that. 

01:56:55
KRISPIN MATTHEW Ah, yeah, I really, I prefer to be called Kris. But, uhm, I, I'm not doing so great here. I can't believe I'm back here, uhm, this place is, it just such a horrible place for me to be right now and I just can't believe my parents put me back here. Uhm, I was really struggling before I left and, uhm, I don't know, I, I don't, I don't know what to do, 

01:57:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. K-- Kris you sa-- you sound a little bit angry I wonder if you could speak to that a little bit more, uhm, because my paper work also sho-- show that your parents were very supportive of, ah, who you are in terms of your identity. 

01:57:35
KRISPIN MATTHEW Well, its interesting because I really thought that they were very supportive. Uhm - 

01:57:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:57:40
KRISPIN MATTHEW - they had been, uhm, or at least it appeared to me that they had been I mean at home I was allowed to be who I wanted to be. 

01:57:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:57:50
KRISPIN MATTHEW Uhm, they knew I was struggling at school, uhm, with being able to be who I wanted to be. 

01:57:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:57:55
KRISPIN MATTHEW Uhm, and, that's part of the reason this really surprises me because, uhm, this school is the last place I wanna be right now and they told me that I had to come back here to finish out my senior year. And I just don't know if I can do that. 

01:58:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So part of you is angry because you feel sent back here, uhm, sent back to this awful place, uhm. 

01:58:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW Yeah, like what, ah-- I just can't believe it, this was the whole reason that, you know, I end up hurting myself the last time. 

01:58:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:58:25
KRISPIN MATTHEW I mean, you know, when I was working with the last counselor, uhm, you know, we we're working on how I could go about sharing who I was with my classmates because I really want to make this transition. I want to make this transition before I get to college because I just wanna be able to start all over. I wanna start as a boy because that's who I truly believe that I am. 

01:58:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:58:50
KRISPIN MATTHEW And, so after working with that counselor for a while, uhm, you know, we thought maybe I could take the first step in confiding in one person I felt I could trust. So, I did I confided in this - 

01:59:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:59:10
KRISPIN MATTHEW - one person in this one classmate I thought I could trust and this person spread it all over school that I am this transgendered person that they, you know, said that-- all this just horrible, horrible things - 

01:59:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:59:25
KRISPIN MATTHEW - and it went throughout the school and people started threatening me and-- i-- it just, it was so awful. 

01:59:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:59:30
KRISPIN MATTHEW And I just couldn't take it anymore. 

01:59:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Could, could, could you-- Kris could you tell me what, what was, a-- awful about that and what's awful about it now because I know you also talk about recently seeing a movie in which there was a lot of violence and in the end this person was killed. And, ah, there is a part of me wondering if you're also struggling with are these people going to attack me in the same manner? 

01:59:55
KRISPIN MATTHEW Well they started to. 

01:59:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

01:59:55
KRISPIN MATTHEW I mean that's exactly, you know, in this movie it just started with the name calling and then it move to the physical violence, ah, and yeah, the main character ended up being killed and that main character I saw myself in that main character so when the, the verbal abuse started and the name calling and people then threatened to beat me up after school and, you know, I... 

02:00:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So what was then? What was the next progression for you? Because it seem like after that person, uhm, the student which you confided in that spread it all around the school, ah, it seems like after that event, ah, was so painful so scary that you decided to take your own life. And one of my concerns is I don't want that to happen to you again. I don't want, I don't want you to, ah, attempt to or to successfully take your own life. 

02:00:50
KRISPIN MATTHEW I mean at that point it was just too hard like I didn't know how I was gonna make it. What was the point in making? 

02:00:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:01:00
KRISPIN MATTHEW Uhm, I've made the wrong choice, maybe I mean, I think I know what's gonna feel right for me but no one else dreams and think that, that's the right way for me to go. And I don't know, maybe I, I, don't deserve to be here. Maybe there is just something so wrong with me that I shouldn't be here and, uhm, that's why I took the pills, uhm, I been put on an anti-depressants for a short amount of time and at that point it was just easy to just take the whole bottle and, and be done with it. Ah - 

02:01:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:01:30
KRISPIN MATTHEW - unfortunately I wasn't successful. But, I just don't know why... 

02:01:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Wait, wait, wait when you, when you say unfortunately you weren't successful you still entertaining that as a possibility that, that would solve the problem? Ah, how would you see, I guess what would be ideal for you? 

02:01:45
KRISPIN MATTHEW Right now? 

02:01:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:01:50
KRISPIN MATTHEW Ideal for me to, would be to which is so not possible but would be-- to be able to just keep that whole transition phase that I will have to go through to get to where I wanna be. I just want to be that man at the end. That's who I am, that's where I wanna get to. 

02:02:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:02:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW And but the whole transition phase where I am gonna have to endure to get there is just more than I think I can handle right now. 

02:02:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. And my guess is when you say endure, uhm, to get there is not the process itself but the outside forces and the bents and people. 

02:02:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW Yeah, I can handle the, the physical, surgical pieces to get there done in the hormonal changes and that, that's not my fear, my fear is what people are going to say and do around me, to me, uhm, wha... 

02:02:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Is your fear that people are going to rape you, kill you, name you? 

02:02:45
KRISPIN MATTHEW Sure. Oh, my god! Yeah, I mean they have certainly threatened to do it and, you know, I'm not very large person - 

02:02:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:02:50
KRISPIN MATTHEW - and its not like I could fend them off and, uhm, ah, yeah, I just I see it happening and after I, you know, like mention that movie that I saw - 

02:03:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:03:00
KRISPIN MATTHEW - it happen there, that was a true story. 

02:03:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:03:00
KRISPIN MATTHEW And it happen to him and... 

02:03:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ On scale of, of one to ten, ah, one being you don't believe at that much, ten being I absolutely believe that someone in the school were either rape me or kill me, where, where are at in terms of your thinking? 

02:03:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW Right now I'm at about an eight or nine probably. I... 

02:03:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So its pretty high that you believe someone would actually do it. 

02:03:30
KRISPIN MATTHEW I do there was a time that I didn't, you know, I couldn't believe that people would actually get to that point and, you know, the name calling all that have endured my whole life. But the violence just, I couldn't believe it once my secret so to speak was spread out over it was unbelievable the threats that I received and, uhm, but they, they just seem so sincere - 

02:03:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:03:50
KRISPIN MATTHEW - and so real. And now I'm back in this school and I just I can't face anyone. I don't, I don't wanna walk through the halls cuz it got notes. 

02:04:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Let say, has anyone, ah, actively try to harm you? 

02:04:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW Most of them have been verbal threats, uhm - 

02:04:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:04:10
KRISPIN MATTHEW - I did have one kid throw a punch at me one day but, uhm, I ducked and I run and I didn't come back to school that day. 

02:04:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:04:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW Uhm, you know, that, that's about the extensive at right now but the threats are just so real. I just felt, I haven't given them the opportunity yet - 

02:04:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:04:30
KRISPIN MATTHEW - but there could be that time where I'm just in the wrong place at the wrong time. And I just think they'll take that opportunity. 

02:04:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Now I know that your parents are really supportive and I, I also know that there are some financial constraints and so for now they decided the only thing they can do is send you back - 

02:04:50
KRISPIN MATTHEW Right. 

02:04:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - ah, to a public school. I am also very aware of how you feel, uhm, knowing emotionally but your legitimate concerns about being, uhm, a victim of a violent act, at how scary and awful that might be. As a school counselor I think one of the things I can do is to do everything I can to address those threats. Because that shouldn't happen. 

02:05:25
KRISPIN MATTHEW How? How could you-- how can you do that? How could you poss-- what do you gonna do? 

02:05:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Well I think, ah, you know, from myself one of the things I can do is I can, ah, begin to educate people about sexual identity. I can begin to educate teachers and administrators and tap into other allies and that we just don't tolerate violence. I mean we have a, we have it, you know, zero tolerance for violence in the school. So why are we letting it happen and I-- and we have to take some of that responsibility. I also want you to know that this is a safe place and I'm also going to, ah, with your permission, ah, talk to your, ah, teachers about giving you sort of like a, a blank pass for those moments when you feel most threatened that you can come and just even sit my office whether I'm here or not or whether I'm busy, uhm, you know, or if there some other safe place that you feel in the school. Uhm, that you can just kinda give yourself a time out and move away from the violent and say, you know, I need a time out I can't ca-- I can't begin to focus on math because you know what this kids beside are really harassing me and right now I'm truly believing that they are going to hurt me. I mean in future sessions one of the things I would like us to explore is to what extent that's true and I don't know right now I don't know if, you know, there, there eight or nine range of something really violence gonna happen is true, if its gonna stop at verbal which is still not to be tolerated, uhm, but I also want you, uhm, I also want to help you find a way to, ah, cope with the strong emotions that you're feeling, uhm, because I also sense that when you said if I can just get to the other side and be a boy, be a man, be who I'm supposed to be there will be relief in that. 

02:07:40
KRISPIN MATTHEW Yeah. 

02:07:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ The hard part is the process in between that's gonna occur throughout this senior year. And its my role to kind of do what I can to diminish what's out there in terms of hallway talk, potential violence, uhm, you know, other threats, ah, I will also, uhm, ask you to, uhm, hope we feel comfortable enough with me to report any of those incidents to me so they can be adequately addressed. Cause I don't know if, if, if a big wall, you know, the whole cla-- senior class or everybody here in high school is, you know, out to get me its hard for me to make specific interventions but - 

02:08:30
KRISPIN MATTHEW Yeah, I understand. 

02:08:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - ah. 

02:08:35
KRISPIN MATTHEW I understand. 

02:08:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ You know systemically I can make specific interventions. But when someone threatens another students life I think, you know, that, that student needs to be called upon and I want you to understand that I'm committed to doing that for you. 

02:08:50
KRISPIN MATTHEW I, I appreciate that, I, I do, I just, just don't see how it kinda work but if you seem pretty confident that somehow we can make this work and, uhm, I'm certainly willing to - 

02:09:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:09:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW - to, to give it a shot, uhm... 

02:09:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Well it's not that, you know, and I wanna give you the impression its gonna be, uhm, the perfect picture, there's gonna be a magic pill I think it will still be a difficult process. I think my rule as co-- counselor is to help you, uhm, cope better with this so they not, ah, you know, attempting to take your life or doing , you know, using drugs and alcohol self-medicating doing whatever you might do that is, ah, damaging to yourself. But I also think that I need to work with the other folks who are perpetuating this, ah - 

02:09:45
KRISPIN MATTHEW Right. 

02:09:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - on you. 

02:09:50
KRISPIN MATTHEW That's interesting I mean what you are saying is similar to what my last counselor said and said, you know, he was gonna do some advocating for me - 

02:09:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:09:55
KRISPIN MATTHEW - which, uhm, yeah, I'm sure he might have tried to do I just haven't experience - 

02:10:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:10:05
KRISPIN MATTHEW - a difference and, you know, since coming from the hospital people think that I'm crazier than ever. 

02:10:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:10:10
KRISPIN MATTHEW So, ah... 

02:10:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So it sounds like you deal with a multitude or, ah, of levels one is your anger with your family because of they so supportive why do they send you back? Your peers, your other school, the other people in the school are talking about you - 

02:10:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW Yeah. 

02:10:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - in terms of who you are with you, and sexual identity. They are also talking about you now because your, uhm, suicide attempt. So I can re-imagine how that has component the problem and how hard that must be, ah, for you to get up each morning and come to school but so far I haven't heard that you haven't come to school so there's, there's, there's something kicking in there. 

02:10:55
KRISPIN MATTHEW Well, I mean every morning I go to the biggest fight of my life to get to school. But all I want is to get to the end of this year like I do wanna graduate, I, I do, I do I feel like there at least at this point that there is a chance that I can get to the other side, uhm, but then of course I have my moment where I just can't I don't how I'm gonna get there. 

02:11:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:11:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW But part of my reason for coming to school is, uhm, you know, I, I feel like there could be a life out there for me, I just need to get pass this part of it and, but I need help to get there cause I can't. 

02:11:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Can you say and I think part of that is need your own belief system and, ah, in terms of the impact of that movie that the violence is going to occur to me and, you know, i-- is that real or not I know you don't need to diminish that in any way because it, it may be very real on a large scale but again I need to, uhm, do my own homework. Ah, and it maybe that through the process as we, as we move along we look at other options with your parents in terms of is coming to the school in your best interest and, you know, in terms of your own health, ah, and mental wellbeing. Is homeschool another possibility, what are there other realms of possibility, ah, for you to educate, getting your GED. Hmm, what's gonna serve you best certainly coming from I've got to struggle each day with going to this dreadful place where I fear for my life, ah, I would hope that you do not have to live with that every day that as to me, I'm not working, you know, well with my colleagues and your other, ah, counselor is another, ah, your previous counselor is another resource and together, you know, there are other teachers other people that we can build a support network for you. It may not be up and running like that it will take a little time but in the end if its not in your best interest if its not serving you and you still feel as a, as awful as you describe today there were many to work at other options. 

02:13:20
KRISPIN MATTHEW Okay. Okay. 

02:13:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay. So, you know, lets, lets, let's try and touch base, you know, more than, than once a week I do want you to feel comfortable coming down anytime and I will before you leave write that, you know, please - 

02:13:35
KRISPIN MATTHEW Okay. 

02:13:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - let. 

02:13:35
KRISPIN MATTHEW Okay. 

02:13:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Kris come whenever he needs a time out. And I will also make a note to your teacher that you preferred to be called Kris and that your record to be like that. 

02:13:50
KRISPIN MATTHEW Okay, okay. Uh-hmm. 

02:13:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay. 

02:13:55
FIFTH SCENARIO COUNSELING MIDDLE SCHOOL INTERRACIAL LESBIAN MOM'S ABOUT THEIR SON'S DECLINING GRADES AND EMOTIONAL ABUSE AT SCHOOL 

02:14:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm, in the fifth scenario we have a school counselor who has contacted a parent because a sixth grade boy's grades are in decline. This scenario teaches affirmative skill building for professional counselors working with families that are headed by lesbians. 

02:14:20
[sil.] 

02:14:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Welcome Theresa you and I talked briefly by phone concerned about, ah, your son Daryl(ph) and you indicated to me that you wanted to bring someone else along. I said well okay, hey, why not. Help me understand, ah, who you are and how I can be of help to you, ah, and your son today? 

02:14:45
THERESA WYRE Okay well let me introduce to you this is Kate. 

02:14:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Hi. 

02:14:45
THERESA WYRE This is my significant other. 

02:14:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, a pleasure to meet you. 

02:14:50
THERESA WYRE And Kate is - 

02:14:50
KATE HOWELL Nice to meet you. 

02:14:50
THERESA WYRE - helping me to raise Daryl. 

02:14:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Terrific. 

02:14:55
THERESA WYRE Yes. 

02:14:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Well, I'm honored that you have allowed me to know all of whom you are in your family. Terrific. 

02:15:00
THERESA WYRE Yes. 

02:15:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, well so we talked about by phone, ah, certainly we're all concerned at this point about Daryl's grades. He was doing so well until toward the end of fifth grade and this year, ah, its been a mess so I talk to you, you said you are also quite concerned and let's talk about how we can try and help Daryl reverse the process. 

02:15:20
THERESA WYRE Okay, well we've recently found out that Daryl is being teased in school about our relationship. 

02:15:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

02:15:30
THERESA WYRE Yes. 

02:15:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Now I told you I had met with Daryl couple of times and he basically said nothing to me, and usually I can get kids to talk to me so I knew something was going on. Ah, and I wonder if maybe he was protecting cause he did not say a word I mean, you only refer he didn't ever say. 

02:15:45
KATE HOWELL Well that I think maybe partially, uhm, our responsibilities well because we've kind of kept this, uhm, under wraps just because its been working in the past. 

02:15:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

02:16:00
KATE HOWELL For us and for Daryl. 

02:16:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

02:16:00
KATE HOWELL And he has been functioning well enough, uhm, but now because of the teasing and his grades dropping we're both really concerned and we thought that this was a good time for us to really get involved and maybe if he sees the two of us opening up that maybe a little bit more ready to open up with you. 

02:16:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

02:16:20
KATE HOWELL And discuss with you. 

02:16:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. So it sounds like for whatever reasons you chose to do some management issues around your identities as a couple, as a family and they were working well but if Daryl is being teased about, is being teased that you ha-- well tell me the specific of what he is being teased about. 

02:16:40
THERESA WYRE Uhm, well people in the community is, ah, na-- now starting to realize that Kate and I are in a relationship. 

02:16:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

02:16:50
THERESA WYRE And that's where the teasing begin so starting with the parents - 

02:16:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

02:16:50
THERESA WYRE - and now the kids are picking up the parents bad habit and now when they see us they point and they laugh. And now Daryl is catching the brunt of it all. 

02:17:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right, so, what types of things have you said to Daryl about your relationship and how you handle it in the past and what you might be differently now? 

02:17:10
THERESA WYRE Well basically in the home, uhm, it really has had been an issue its like - 

02:17:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

02:17:20
THERESA WYRE - we, we really don't discuss very much we're happy in our home. 

02:17:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Great. Uh-hmm. 

02:17:25
THERESA WYRE So we really don't speak much about it. Its not an issue for us. 

02:17:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

02:17:25
KATE HOWELL And, and like I said we it-- its been, uhm, it hasn't been a problem, uhm, for, for a long time and, uhm, we are kind of with the if its don't fix it if it ain't broke type of thing. 

02:17:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

02:17:35
KATE HOWELL And but now we're realizing that we, we can't do this and there's so many now, there is so many more developmental - 

02:17:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

02:17:50
ADAM L. BENSON - issues that he is gonna be going through. I mean, just being 12. 

02:17:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

02:17:55
KATE HOWELL And, uhm, uhm, and we want at least help him with the part that we can. 

02:18:00
THERESA WYRE Right. 

02:18:00
KATE HOWELL You know control ourselves. 

02:18:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES I think you have certainly right, I think that developmentally, you know, about the transition of middle school, these changes, puberty all sorts of things and this is an ideal time for him to really be going what's going on, uhm, talk to me about your ethnic racial identities a little bit give me some background about religious identity too so I have a fuller picture of who you are. 

02:18:20
THERESA WYRE Okay, uhm, my parent, ah, were born and raised in Alabama so we're from the south. 

02:18:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

02:18:30
THERESA WYRE Basically we're a African Southern, Southerners. 

02:18:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES You have a particular religious affiliation? 

02:18:40
THERESA WYRE Baptist. 

02:18:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, all right. And how about you? 

02:18:45
KATE HOWELL Uhm, background is mostly, ah, White European. 

02:18:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

02:18:50
KATE HOWELL Uhm, and, uhm, my family religion has been a combination of Palestine, uhm, my parents got born in Catholic but I haven't really identified with, with any of them. 

02:19:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Okay, so as an interracial couple are you close to other interracial couples? 

02:19:10
THERESA WYRE No. 

02:19:10
KATE HOWELL Not really, there is not very many in our - 

02:19:10
THERESA WYRE Right. 

02:19:10
THERESA WYRE - in our... 

02:19:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES (inaudible ) in this town. 

02:19:15
KATE HOWELL Right. 

02:19:15
THERESA WYRE No. 

02:19:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Oh, okay. So I wonder if maybe one of the things that we might talk about is how we help you connect to other folks. Sounds like you're pretty isolated, ah, and if that's the case, you're on interracial issues what about are you around other, ah, women couples or gay male couples? 

02:19:35
THERESA WYRE Well, basically our families are pretty supportive and I have a sister who is also a lesbian - 

02:19:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Oh, great. 

02:19:40
THERESA WYRE - so, that our family was supportive so those are who usually who we surround ourselves with. 

02:19:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Family is nearby or they're far away? 

02:19:50
THERESA WYRE They're pretty close. 

02:19:50
KATE HOWELL Yeah. They're nearby us. 

02:19:50
THERESA WYRE My family is close. 

02:19:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES So the issue then is really one of kids and peer pressure and being inappropriate. 

02:19:55
THERESA WYRE Ah, right. 

02:19:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. There any other concerns that you have about Daryl at this point? Any behavior changes that you've noticed or other things that might be a part of declining grades? 

02:20:05
THERESA WYRE Uhm, I'm starting to notice that Daryl is getting angry. 

02:20:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

02:20:10
THERESA WYRE He seems to be angry of all of the time. 

02:20:15
KATE HOWELL Isolating himself. 

02:20:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

02:20:15
KRISPIN MATTHEW Yeah. 

02:20:15
THERESA WYRE Yeah. 

02:20:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES I, I'd really collaborate that, I, ah, like I said it's, it's rare that I find kids that won't open up to me and I count them at couple of times and it's just like this wall, I really couldn't get through. Uhm, do you have any reason to suspect that there might be anything else going on with him behind the anger or in additional to what we talk about so far? 

02:20:40
THERESA WYRE No, I think its the teasing because now the, the kids are starting to tell him that since we are lesbian then he is gay also and he is, he is angry about that because he doesn't identify... 

02:20:50
KATE HOWELL He's gonna catch it. 

02:20:50
THERESA WYRE Right. 

02:20:50
KATE HOWELL He is another one he is gonna, ah, you know - 

02:20:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

02:20:55
KATE HOWELL - catch it, he is gonna get it. No one will, you know, be with him and, and its, its hard for us to watch him go through that. 

02:21:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Its gotta be horrible. 

02:21:05
KATE HOWELL Yeah. 

02:21:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES It sounds like you've cracked them well, you've great support within your families but now its the external, he is coming up against the prejudice, and the messing stereotypes and all the garbage that, that we have in a, in a homophobic society. So what are the things that I could do as a school counselor to support you all in making the school, ah, a safer environment for him? 

02:21:25
THERESA WYRE Hmm. 

02:21:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Without embarrassing him because I would see he doesn't want the world to know in some ways but... 

02:21:30
KATE HOWELL I, I wouldn't really want, uhm, some of especially the teachers who are working with him directly to know about the teasing going on and maybe if they're made more aware of the situation they'll be more aware and ready to deal with any teasing. 

02:21:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Great. 

02:21:50
KATE HOWELL Uhm, in, in that sense and at least within the school - 

02:21:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

02:21:55
KATE HOWELL - uhm, we can get it tone down - 

02:22:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. 

02:22:00
KATE HOWELL - until we can come and get him more prepared internally. 

02:22:00
THERESA WYRE Right. Right. And I, I'm interested in meeting with the parents of some of these students because that's where basically most of the problems are coming from. 

02:22:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, so at this point the kids are being kids but its really adult issue. 

02:22:20
Theresa Wyre Oh, yes. 

02:22:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Well, those both sound really good. The first one I think actually is easier than the second, and I'd be delighted to offer if I have permission to say you have a student who has two moms, is that all right? May I do that? 

02:22:30
THERESA WYRE Yes. 

02:22:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Ah, yeah, let me know. 

02:22:30
THERESA WYRE It was so, it would suit her his mom. 

02:22:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right, well that's what I was hearing, I don't wanna assume. All right, uhm, and I think, ah, we could certainly do some really good step development around how do you talk about inclusiveness with all family types in classes things like that. 

02:22:45
THERESA WYRE Uh-hmm. 

02:22:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Now as you both know we, ah, have an a very conservative town. Full of folks who are extremely religious and in the religion I see that many of them are overtly hateful toward lesbians and gays. 

02:22:55
THERESA WYRE Yes. 

02:23:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES So, why I said that was lets brain storm about who might be find who are adults in the school who would be allies, who would be supportive of the two of you and all of who you are. Any ideas? 

02:23:10
THERESA WYRE Well... 

02:23:10
KATE HOWELL We haven't really networked ourselves - 

02:23:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

02:23:15
KATE HOWELL - too much within the community maybe you could help - 

02:23:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

02:23:20
KATE HOWELL - connect us or maybe ask the other if there are other parents, uhm, who, who would want out support as well as - 

02:23:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Correct. 

02:23:30
KATE HOWELL - as getting the support. 

02:23:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Great. 

02:23:30
KATE HOWELL We'd appreciate that. 

02:23:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES I, I do know of at least one other, uhm, lesbian identified couple who has children in the school system they're few years older than you are but I know that they're in the community and they are-- they ha-- they have approached, ah, us saying that if anyone else ever comes along, you know, let them know or hear so would that be all right to do that? 

02:23:50
THERESA WYRE That will be great. 

02:23:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES We got, ah, I am talking about couple of years, so I don't know if that's all right or not. But if we start we give you one set of other folks who are in the community. 

02:24:00
THERESA WYRE Okay. 

02:24:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Then I work within I, I hope - 

02:24:00
KATE HOWELL Yeah. 

02:24:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES - that something a solution. All right. And then my thought is if you would contact them then maybe, ah, we could meet together as a group about where to go with the other group of parents cause what we don't wanna do is have you all meet with the group of parents have them go off on you and then even further repercussions. Does that make sense? 

02:24:20
KATE HOWELL Yes. 

02:24:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES My thought is to address this on several levels but grow more slowly with that because of the community that we're in. 

02:24:25
KATE HOWELL Uh-hmm. 

02:24:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES And you played it very subtle obviously its a work for you but at this point its not working for your son not based on you but based on others at this point and that's where we need to do the working - 

02:24:40
KATE HOWELL Yeah. 

02:24:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES - begun. All right, so how you all feeling at this point? 

02:24:40
THERESA WYRE Hmm, I'm a little upset because I'm really concern about Daryl's grade but we'll gonna make it. 

02:24:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-hmm. Okay. I'd like to meet with you all again maybe next week and talk about working on some homework strategies, ways, I , think by your opening more up to the school at this point finding out that you have an ally here, me, ah, let's talk about some other management related issues around the academics per se, see if we get a difference, ah, have you talked with Da-- maybe have you all come in with Daryl together - 

02:25:10
KATE HOWELL I hope that would be... 

02:25:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES - that if you open to it and talk about. 

02:25:15
KATE HOWELL Yeah. That be (inaudible ) 

02:25:16
STUART CHEN-HAYES Cause I think that something will have change now that you all have come in, lets monitor watch that - 

02:25:20
THERESA WYRE Uh-hmm. 

02:25:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES - and then if this doesn't work maybe there are other issues that are there. Don't wanna rule them on entirely - 

02:25:25
THERESA WYRE Uh-hmm. 

02:25:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES - but I'm fine to start with this, we'll go from there. How does that sound? 

02:25:30
KATE HOWELL That sounds great. 

02:25:30
THERESA WYRE Its great. 

02:25:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. Oh, I will set an appointment time and I really admire your courage and honesty and appreciate your coming in today. 

02:25:35
THERESA WYRE Thank you. 

02:25:35
KATE HOWELL Thank you. 

02:25:40
THERESA WYRE Thanks a lot. 

02:25:40
KATE HOWELL Thank you very much. 

02:25:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES sure. 

02:25:40
SICTH SCENARIO AN ORTHODOX JEWISH FATHER SEEKS ASSISTANCE FOR AN 8-YEAR OLD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENT WITH UNORTHODOX GENDER INDENTITY WHO'S BEING EMOTIONALLY ABUSED AT SCHOOL 

02:25:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ In this last scenario as a school counselor I will be working with Adam who is self-identified as a heterosexual parent of an eight year old child who is in our school, ah, who was in my case load, uhm, both of which are orthodox, ah, Jewish they are an orthodox Jewish family. An Adam's concern is that his son has not been demonstrating, uhm, prop-- proper gender, ah, behavior for a young boy. And so he has come in to talk about those concerns because his son is getting picked on during transitional periods at the school, uhm, during break times, lunch and so forth. Uhm, because he is not being "a boy." So, Adam how are-- how are you doing? 

02:26:50
ADAM L. BENSON Well, ah, I came to you today, uhm, pretty concerned about my son. 

02:26:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:26:55
ADAM L. BENSON You know he's been coming to school for a while here but lately he has been coming, ah, home and he has been very upset, he has been crying and, ah, he is telling me that, ah, the children, the other children are picking on him calling him names. 

02:27:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:27:10
ADAM L. BENSON And, ah, just making fun of him and some other had threatened him. 

02:27:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:27:15

02:27:40
ADAM L. BENSON Well, my son is been, he has been coming home saying that they're calling him, ah, I think, ah, he is not really, ah, acting like the other guys in the school. He is, you know, uninterested - 

02:27:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ When, when you, when you say that what do you mean? 

02:27:50
ADAM L. BENSON He is not interested in sports and he has been more academically and kind which is something my wife and I, ah, like impressed on him. 

02:28:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

02:28:00
ADAM L. BENSON Ah, I, I don't know where he lost his interest in sports because that's something that's interesting to us too but he seems to just be motivated by the books and he is not interested in the sports and, ah, the other boys in particular are picking on him. 

02:28:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

02:28:15
ADAM L. BENSON Ah, he seems to be playing more with the girls in the, in the, in t he classroom - 

02:28:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:28:20
ADAM L. BENSON - and, ah, and they been calling him names like sissy and Queenie and I think the, the term fag he came home with and I didn't know that, never use that in our house. 

02:28:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Does he have an understanding what those words mean or does he just know that those are hurtful? 

02:28:30
ADAM L. BENSON And he-- I don't know if he knows what they-- I, I've never asked him. 

02:28:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay. 

02:28:35
ADAM L. BENSON You know, I, I just ha-- I know that he is hurt by them. 

02:28:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

02:28:40
ADAM L. BENSON You know I think they think that he is acting over girly so they call him, you know, girly type of names. 

02:28:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. So as, as a father how are you responding to that? Because obviously, uhm, maybe that's what we think maybe we need to explore the language. Ah, you have some sense of what those terms mean. 

02:29:00
ADAM L. BENSON Yeah. 

02:29:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ What are you concerns around your sons behavior? 

02:29:05
ADAM L. BENSON Well to be honest with you I'm not very comfortable at his behavior I mean, I don't, ah, I don't know what to do, he comes home and - 

02:29:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:29:15
ADAM L. BENSON - ah, he likes to play with Barbie's and he wanted my wife and I to buy him Barbie's and I was not comfortable with that and, ah, he acts he has a lot of feminine mannerisms and, uhm, I'm, I'm not comfortable with it but - 

02:29:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:29:25
ADAM L. BENSON - I guess that's something I need to work on. I'm not really sure how but I'm, I'm really concerned about the safety in your school. 

02:29:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:29:35
ADAM L. BENSON And what you're gonna do to help protect him? 

02:29:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay, I hear a couple of things, one I'm very concerned and supportive of my son. Two, my son is, ah, having a negative reaction to what's happening in school. He is, he is feeling threatened, he knows that kids are making fun from that's making him uncomfortable. And three as a parent you're concerned about his behaviors and, ah, and as I've listened to you describe his behaviors I'm wondering if you're concerned that your son will grow up to be gay, bisexual, transgender. What you've, you know, thought about that at all? 

02:30:15
ADAM L. BENSON Well, uhm, I have to be honest that I have thought of that - 

02:30:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:30:20
ADAM L. BENSON - and, ah, I hope that that's not the case, uhm, I don't know what I do. I, I certainly love my son very much. 

02:30:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:30:25
ADAM L. BENSON I am not sure what I would do how I would respond to that. 

02:30:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:30:30
ADAM L. BENSON In the meantime I'd see this behaviors that I'm very uncomfortable with. 

02:30:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. So in your eyes the idea well would be how will you one protect my son, two help to change his behaviors? 

02:30:45
ADAM L. BENSON Yeah, I, I, ah, yeah. I guess. 

02:30:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ In, in, in an ideal world. 

02:30:50
ADAM L. BENSON In an ideal world. Certainly the first one I feel very strongly about and the second one if I'm honest with myself yes I would love it. There was something you could do to change his behavior. 

02:31:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Well I can't say that, you know, I'm, I'm here as his counselor to change his behavior, uhm, what concerns me most is how kids are, are picking on him and, and how that's impact him both here at school and, you know, ha-- at home. Uhm, I would imagine he's not, ah, very happy about coming to school, ah, active and being picked on. Uhm, but I'm also a little bit concerned about how you, uhm, carry the fear of what it would be like if he grows to be anything different than what you had in mind, in terms of his sexual identity. 

02:31:45
ADAM L. BENSON Well in, ah, my religion doesn't really - 

02:31:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:31:50
ADAM L. BENSON - uhm, ah, it accepts, ah, I guess homosexual behavior. Ah, actually accepts homosexuality but it does not accept homosexual behavior. 

02:32:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:32:00
ADAM L. BENSON So I don't know what I would if I found out that my son was gay, I don't know what type of life he would be able to live and still be able to integrate that with being Jewish, or as orthodox Jewish. 

02:32:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So, so maybe one of, one of the things would be how is the school going to protect my son from threats violence, teasing and how maybe this is the point where we start exploring, uhm, as a family if this is a possibility it may not be a possibility. 

02:32:35
ADAM L. BENSON Uh-hmm. 

02:32:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ He just may have interest that are different and he is heterosexual but it sounds like in the back of your mind, you're a little bit concerned, you know, if he is anything different than that and its and maybe now is the time that we can begin to explore that. Okay. Adam what I've heard you say is really, uhm, three concerns, ah, first and foremost seems to be yours, your sons protection, ah, and how is he know physical wellbeing here in the school. The second concern is that if his behaviors and how does that fit, not fit with what you have expected or thought of him to be as a boy growing up to be a man, uhm, as an orthodox Jewish man. Uhm, and the third piece is really and opposite of that which is your own fears is, if he is manifesting this behaviors might he grow up to be gay, les-- gay, gay or bisexual, transgender. 

02:33:45
ADAM L. BENSON Uh-hmm. 

02:33:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ And what would that mean for me and my family? 

02:33:50
ADAM L. BENSON Yeah. 

02:33:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Ah, but that, I mean that may or may not be true we don't know yet, ah, could just be his behaviors and that maybe what's no-- normal for him, ah, we don't know that, uhm. 

02:34:05
ADAM L. BENSON Well my wife seems to think that its okay. I think I'm the one that's concerned about it right now. 

02:34:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So your wife... 

02:34:10
ADAM L. BENSON That's why I'm here. 

02:34:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Your wife, your wife is okay with the behaviors? 

02:34:15
ADAM L. BENSON My wife, yeah, my wife doesn't seem to feel like this any problem, you know, he said-- she says to me that, you know, he is, ah, just playing with other things and there's nothing wrong with it and why we should just let him be who he is at this point. 

02:34:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:34:30
ADAM L. BENSON I have a problem with that because I'm thinking in the future, you know, what is this? What I don't wanna support this behaviors. Again I love my son and I, I am sort of supporting him but I'm not very comfortable supporting it. 

02:34:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Because in the future, what does that mean for you? Ah, as you follow it on that? 

02:34:45
ADAM L. BENSON I'm scared that if I support this behaviors he is gonna end up being gay, I don't even think about transgender or anything like that. 

02:34:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. So the big fear was if he continues down this path my son might be gay, how I deal with it? 

02:35:00
ADAM L. BENSON How can, yeah, how would he gonna - 

02:35:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ How I integrate that, how would he deal to? 

02:35:00
ADAM L. BENSON - be able to, how can I do that, uhm. And... 

02:35:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ I wanted, I wanted you just takes a, a, a step back a moment to what something that you said about your wife being okay with his behaviors because I did as, you know, ah, invite both you and your wife, ah, to come in and meet with me and, uhm, she didn't come in. And I'm not sure if she was working or something else was happening. 

02:35:25
ADAM L. BENSON She thinks I'm over reacting I mean, she, she is concerned about his safety in the school. 

02:35:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:35:30
ADAM L. BENSON That's basically it. She thinks I'm over reacting when I'm concern about this other things. 

02:35:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Certainly one of the things that we can do, ah, in the school system and particularly I his, as his counselor, ah, is not to work on, uhm, I mean that, ah, get your fear and reaction, ah, to the statement in a minute. 

02:35:55
ADAM L. BENSON Hmm. 

02:35:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Its not to work on necessarily changing his behaviors but to work on protecting him, ah, he shouldn't not be, uhm, out there for people to make fun of. He should not be a victim of, you know, verbal abuse or physical violent. Should not have to put up with that and that's obviously impacting how we interacts with his peers, his grades, his perception of school, ah, obviously, uhm, you know, what you've articulated is you have high expectations of him in school he doing very well in school. So I wouldn't want to lose that peace. And I think there are many ways, ah, that we can do that, you know, so-- set up as support system, do some education, ah, to their role at school and... 

02:36:45
ADAM L. BENSON I just wanna say that - 

02:36:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:36:50
ADAM L. BENSON - in terms I know that, ah, in terms of being Jewish and - 

02:36:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:36:55
ADAM L. BENSON - wearing his Yakama in school you guys have done a wonderful job about that - 

02:36:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

02:36:55
ADAM L. BENSON - and educated the staff about, you know, having, having orthodox Jewish people in the school. 

02:37:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:37:05
ADAM L. BENSON But I-- in terms of being gay or get those name calling those type of names I don't know how much education you've done with the step. It certainly an, ah, ca-- ah, topic that's very uncomfortable to me as you could see. 

02:37:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Right. 

02:37:15
ADAM L. BENSON Ah. 

02:37:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Oh, we've cer-- certainly done some and we can do more, I mean your other bridges to, you know, your son is not the only person that had this particular set of behaviors. I think we can look at, you know, any one of our students in any given moment and say well, you know, this girl is not behaving and this man or this boy is not behaving in that manner. And make it global and you say, you know, we're not gonna tolerate taunting, name calling, ah, you know, beating up whatever the situation is. 

02:37:50
ADAM L. BENSON Uh-hmm. 

02:37:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ And then do some, do some education. I also think though some of the issue that you've raised in terms of your son's behaviors might have to do with your, ah, naming or labeling those behaviors to specific sexual identity which we have no idea yet, what your son who'd-- who your son would be in that realm. 

02:38:15
ADAM L. BENSON Uh-hmm. That's what my wife says. 

02:38:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ You know so I think like I said earlier one of the things we can do, uhm, as a family hopefully your, your wife will, uhm, be willing to, to come in is to begin to explore what this behaviors mean in orthodox Jewish family. And in that context I would like to ask you, uhm, because your wife isn't here, ah, is she also orthodox Jewish? Was she raised that way or is? 

02:38:50
ADAM L. BENSON Yeah, yes she was. 

02:38:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay. 

02:38:50
ADAM L. BENSON So I mean both have the same background. 

02:38:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:38:55
ADAM L. BENSON I was... 

02:38:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So you both have very similar backgrounds but you have a different takes on his behavior right now. 

02:39:00
ADAM L. BENSON Yeah. 

02:39:00
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ And it's a, its a big concern of yours because in the back of your mind now that I've asked you, you're thinking, oh my goodness my son is gonna grow up to be gay. What if it just maybe his behaviors? 

02:39:15
ADAM L. BENSON Yes, ah, I guess I'm jumping to conclusions - 

02:39:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:39:20
ADAM L. BENSON - on some level. 

02:39:20
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ How was that, ah, for you to hear? 

02:39:25
ADAM L. BENSON Ah, the whole, this whole topic is making me it makes me very anxious. 

02:39:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:39:30
ADAM L. BENSON And, ah, ah, it, ah, feel, uhm, somewhat comfortable hearing that this doesn't just because he's acting in a, a typical manner - 

02:39:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:39:45
ADAM L. BENSON - that, uhm, that doesn't... 

02:39:45
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Oh, it seems to be at a typical manner to you but to a larger population may or may not be. Its certainly what is taught to the general society but certainly there are probably, you know, more boys that have this behaviors, more girls that have stereotypical ma-- you know - 

02:40:05
ADAM L. BENSON Yeah. 

02:40:05
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - male behaviors, or boy behaviors. 

02:40:05
ADAM L. BENSON Uhm, I'm feeling like boys should be boys that's it, you know, just act like a man. 

02:40:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:40:10
ADAM L. BENSON I have a problem with my son playing with dolls, I don't know how to support that, you know, completely, I, I am, I am biting lip when, when he asks for a doll. 

02:40:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:40:25
ADAM L. BENSON I don't know what to do about that? 

02:40:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. What do you do about that? 

02:40:35
ADAM L. BENSON Ah, that's where I let my wife take over cause I, I, I don't know what to do about that. 

02:40:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. So one of the things in the future that we can do is again hopefully is that family is to explore, you know, what could you do? Should you do anything, ah, I mean, there's a, I think there's a whole realm of things that we can look at but, ah, between now and our next meeting, uhm, I would have really ask you to explore for yourself what it means for your son to have this behaviors outside of the talking that he's getting because certainly that, that's a, another issue that, ah, I can address, you know, similar to integrating, uhm, orthodox Jewish with that means, ah, ah, to be orthodox Jewish in, in this school system. 

02:41:35
ADAM L. BENSON Uh-hmm. 

02:41:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ So you know I can begin to re-address that but I would really like you to explore and your wife to explore what it means, uhm, for him to behave in ways that you think are a typical I think was your word, ah, for - 

02:41:50
ADAM L. BENSON Uh-hmm. 

02:41:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ - a boy and what you're fears and concerns are. You know what is the root of those fears and concerns. And then maybe we can address those, ah, in our next meeting, start to do that. 

02:42:05
ADAM L. BENSON Okay, all right. 

02:42:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Is that okay? 

02:42:10
ADAM L. BENSON Yeah. 

02:42:10
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ All right. You have any questions for me Adam? Hmm. Sort of like it was sort, a little bit of a hard session to kind of few things, ah, was a little bit frightening to you. 

02:42:20
ADAM L. BENSON I came here with the focus of making sure he's safe and now I'm sort of can't leaving with this, ah, a lot of different thoughts in my head - 

02:42:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm. 

02:42:30
ADAM L. BENSON - ah, that I have to think about. 

02:42:30
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ But I do wanna re-assure your, ah, on this safety issue. We will do our best to address the safety issues through education, through interrupting, though not tolerating, uhm, name calling and any kind of abusive behaviors, I do want you to understand that we will do our best system and later take care of that. But I also want you to begin to think these other things because, you know, it, ah, at some point its all going to intercept that would be nice to start now, ah, while those questions are being raised now, ah, and to begin to, uhm, reflect on them and grow with them. 

02:43:10
ADAM L. BENSON Okay. Yeah. 

02:43:15
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay, any reservations seem just quite a bit, just wanna make sure. 

02:43:20
ADAM L. BENSON Uhm, are you saying though that my is gonna, might, might not be gay. 

02:43:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Right, he, I mean, may not be. 

02:43:25
ADAM L. BENSON Okay. 

02:43:25
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ I mean we don't, we don't know. At this point those are simply his interest areas. That's are simply things he like to do. 

02:43:35
ADAM L. BENSON Okay. 

02:43:35
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Okay. 

02:43:35
ADAM L. BENSON Yeah. Thank you. 

02:43:40
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ I know that's, I know that's hard because sometimes we go back to what our what is our fear component, but, uhm. Yeah. It just simply maybe thought of is behaviors. Okay? 

02:43:50
ADAM L. BENSON Okay, yeah. 

02:43:50
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Right. Thank you. 

02:43:55
ADAM L. BENSON Thank you. 

02:43:55
LYNN HALEY-BANEZ Uh-hmm.
