CAMILLO LORIEDO Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce myself. I'm Camillo Loriedo from Rome, Italy. And I have the pleasure and honor to introduce to you, Jean Houston and the thesis of session indicated to point out the points. So, she will present, ah, about the subject of the purpose, how to be on purpose and to work on this kind of a subject. And, ah, she's consultant of United Nations, a senior consultant of United Nations. She's the founder of, ah, the moment of-- for human potentials. She wrote 28 books, so she's a very prolific author. And also she's a, a little bit Italian because the mother - 

00:00:45
JEAN HOUSTON Yeah. 

00:00:45
CAMILLO LORIEDO - comes half-Italian. So her mom come from Syracuse, so I feel a little bit at home, because also Ernie comes from Italy, too. And on this other side, we have the wizards of, ah, Ernest Rossi and Kathy Rossi. So, they will speak after so let me give the microphone to, ah, Jean Houston. Thank you. 

00:01:10
JEAN HOUSTON Thank you very much. Yup. I'm gonna hope to move all these brilliant slides that we've just had. Observing brain plasticity mirror and neurons. No. Not my field. Oh, here we are. Let me take this out of the way for those of you who can't see. Okay. Well, it's very good to be here and to be with my dear friends, Ernest and Kathryn Rossi. Bravo. This is the Italian section here. Here we are. Again, with a little story about purpose. It seems that Mrs. Rosencrantz went to her travel agent. And she said, "Listen darling. This year I have a higher purpose. This year I don't wanna go to Israel. I don't wanna go to the south of France. This year my higher purpose is to go and see the swami of the year, Swami Anandananda." He says, "Mrs. Rosencrantz, have you any idea what's involve? You have to take at least five planes and then a broken down bus and then a yak cart across the Himalayas? And then you have to walk for three months and then you're on line for two months? No. You don't wanna do it." "So, book me already," she said. So, she takes the five planes and she gets on the broken bus out of Kathmandu and she walks for three months advicing everybody on the way even though they didn't speak English or Yiddish. And then, for two months, she's on a long, long line and finally she gets up to the cave where the Great Swami Anandananda is in his profound samadhi, meditations. And a little man comes out with a little dot yellow, you know, in a saffron robe. He says, "You'll realize, of course, you can have only three words with the Great Swami Anandananda." "Three words darling. Don't worry. That's, that's all I need." And she goes in and there he is this beautiful man, coils of black hair, people chanting on either side, "Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm." And his eyes rolled up in ecstacy. And she leans over and she says, "Morris, come home!" So the variety of purposeful experience is, is very varied. Old friends, we are purposed at every stage of our development from being a fertilized egg going through the stages of our embryonic development, the stages of our physical, our personal, our social development. Often, the sense and need for purpose comes with a sense of a call. How many of you ever felt called in one way other? How many of you have the hound of heaven going, "Raf! rah-rah-rah-rah!" into your ankles in the morning. Get on with it, you know. Trully, we are called into life. We are called into learning. We are called into loving. We are called into doing. We are called into helping. We are called into reconcilling. We are called into journeying. We are called by the outward. We are called inward. We are called by the flesh. We are called by the spirit. We are called into creating. We are called beyond our limits. We are called into transcendence. And finally, we are called into death. Calling and being called seems essential to our vocation as human beings. It is part of our instinct of our evolution. The energy of purpose sounds in the back of our minds, in the beat of our heart, in the flow of our blood all the time So, it is any wonder that so often we seek the call. We seek the call. We seek the sense of purpose and yearn for a clarity that often eludes us. What is my purpose from being? What special task am I here to do? How do I respond to the lure of becoming and keep up sufficient energy, passion, momentum to light engagement fascination that I agreed to be lured and constantly lured. And, unfortunately, the stuff of everyday life often inhibits the call to lure. You say, "Not now god. Later. Maybe. Well, I don't know." When I grow up, when, when I lose weight, when I pay my taxes, when the kids grow up, or we fall into the sudden comforts of habit or the alienations of discomfort. So many books, so many seminars have emerged over the last decade with discovering one's purpose as the theme. I'd been offering several teleseminars which I expected maybe over-- the last three years, I have maybe 50 people, 10,000 people. You, you want to know where to go in your psychoanalytic process of, of seminar on purpose. I'm in Amazon lists, 143,175 books or items related to purpose. From the enormously successful, spiritually-oriented best-seller, The Purpose Driven Life Rick Warren to Formula 409 All-Purpose Cleaner. Now, what are the historic and cultural reasons for this given the unique shifts and challenges of our time? Well, for one thing. And I wonder how many of you have thought of this. I'd like your hands up if you have thought of this. We are on the eve of 2014, the 100th anniversary of World War I and humanities deadliest century. Has anybody thought of that yet? We are on the brink of ecological, financial, economic, political, and psychological collapse. The old stories that sustained us no longer stupid and the new story is not yet clear. But we're also in a time of whole system transition, a condition of interactive change that affects every aspect of life as we know it. Ah, one of my books I call it "Jump Time". It's related to what in evolutionary biology refer to as "punctuated equilibrium". Punctuated equilibrium. Change. As evolutionary theorists tell us it does not happen gradually rather things go along for a while same old, same old until in a state of living at the-- of species, living at the edge of its tolerance, experiences and in a ferment and stress to punctuate the same old oath, to punctuate the equilibrium with the sudden jump to whole new order of being. I've seen this and fossil, ah, fossil caves, fossil-- ah, ah, fossil shelves where you just see same old same thing. It just keeps as if-- and then suddenly, it is something else. Now I believe that this is happening in our time, what I called "jump time." And what it is, is the changing of the guard on every level in which in every given is literally up for grabs. It is the momentum behind the drama of the world. It is the breakdown and breakthrough of every old way of being, knowing, relating, governing and believing. It is shaking the foundations of all and everything and we find ourselves at present in the midst of the most massive shift of perspective humankind has ever known. Well, of course, all the times thought they were it, they're wrong. This is it. This is it. And it's driving the sense of finding purpose in people of the world over. So, everything in transition. We can no longer afford to live as remedial members of the human race. A new set of values, holistic, syncretic, relationship, and process-oriented, organic, spiritual is rising within us and around us. And though8 old forces and traditions and fear seek to restrain us. What I refer to is galloping entropy, you know. We know there is no going back. Or, a complex time requires a wiser use of our capacities, a richer music of the instrument we have been given. The world will thrive only if we can grow. The possible society will become a reality only if we learn to be the possible humans we are capable of being. What may also be driving the search for purpose is that we are the pilgrims and the parents of this emerging new world, and no old formulas and stopgap solutions will do. So, my big question is always be, how can we in gender the passion for the possible in our human development while discovering what that possible is? Is it even possible to become an artist of destiny capable of decoding the patterns, the clues, the relationships that point you to the mystery that cannot be known directly, ultimately when it comes down to fascination with purpose? Are we fooling ourselves, or are we present at the birth of an opportunity that exceeds our imagination? Now, a lot of my work is both on the micro stage and the macro stage. On the macro stage, ah, during the last, what, 12 or 13 years, I have been around the globe in part having to do with the millennium development goals of the UN. The eight Millennium Development Goals, high purpose goals which range from making-- just cutting in halve extreme poverty, empowering women, lessening child mortality, working for gender equality, ensuring environmental sustainability, global partnerships were development, halting the spread of HIV, AIDS, providing for universal primary education, all by the target gate of 2015. In some places, we are very far ahead, in others not at all. But this was a blueprint. A blueprint of purpose agreed to by all the world's countries and all the world's leading development institutions. And-- but they have is galvanize unprecedented efforts to make a better world. Now, the problem is that to do this, this requires very different means, new ways of being. Now, apart from the UN and along with it, I have worked in many countries. I've worked to date over the last 50 years in 108 countries. And what I do is I treat cultures like persons, and I treat persons like cultures training at every level from heads of state and the White House, too, to the poorest of the poor. And one of the most interesting things that I have found is something that I would have to call "regenopause". Women of a-- I guess the nice way putting it is of a certain age, meaning my age, wanting to find meaning through purpose now that their biological and sometimes their professional duties are done, looking for a second destiny. We might call it the grandma ethic of changing the world. Just several weeks ago, I was in England with, ah, something that I've called together. I wa-- I was, was wondering what would a world designed by women look like? So I brought together 14 of some of the most interesting women in the world. Some of their names you would know and you would not. And it was fascinating how-- for one thing, they all got along. There was no ego. There was no, ah, trying to stop each other. There was very deep conversation and a, a phenomenal dedication. Uhm, it was really quite interesting, too because at one point Halloween night, they decided to all break out. Now, these are very well-known people. And they went madly, wildly dancing. Madly, wildly dancing. And you-- with us was the great, ah, mythologist and bearing about 83 now. And she saw this ecstatic wild dancing and she said, "I've never, hmm, I've never quite--" I said, "You've never seen anything dancing like that?" "Oh, yes, yes. Once, once in Rome. Many years ago, my husband and I saw a performance of Aida and I believe during the dance sequence there was something like this." But, but, but, but what I'm finding with the grandma ethic, friends is, is fascinating because it's these women of a certain age who are-- nobody's writing about this, but it's true leading the way in social change. Taking on the initiatives, creating the programs, educating the young men and young women, and nobody's writing about it. And maybe it's a good thing too because it's an extraordinary movement the world over. Certainly, the rise of women to full partnership with men or the attempt to do so over the whole agenda of human affairs as probably the biggest shift in human history and that is making a huge difference. Massive difference. Terrible backlash. But it is what is happening. And it's an engaging purpose at many, many levels. Now, I find that the sense and power of purpose can be found through working-- and I'm working with people both individually and culturally with four great levels of human consciousness. The sensory physical realm, the psychological realm, the mythic/symbolic realm, and the spiritual or integral realm. Because what happens is that each of these realms opens up new capacities. Each contains energies and images that potentiate the sense and the particulars of purpose. Ultimately, they tend to align and prime people to different orders or purpose and passion for the possible, cooking on more burners, new ways of being, thinking, acting, that give perspective ideas and energy to purpose. So, for example, in the first one, the sensory and physical realm. When you work to enhance sensory and physical life that is in order to use your body, your mind, your heart, in ways that directly aid to the discovery of deeper purpose, fascinating things began to happen. Let's just talk about the sensory systems. No, I am-- I, I, I-- I'm going to disappoint you although I think, ah, Kathryn and Ernest Rossi will not that-- I'm not gonna talk about the neurology or the-- or-- of, of this, but all I can tell you is that when you get beneath a surface cross of consciousness of ordinary consciousness which often inhibits the sense of purpose, then the things higher sense-- orders of purpose tend to arise. I once made a study of 55 of some of the most sustained creative people in North America. Among them were Margaret Mead. Margaret Mead lived with my husband and I for the last six years of her life often on. She decided, "I need another daughter so that's probably you." So, anyway that was my adoption. And her-- she had incredibles in her sensory systems. I mean, she could hear and touch and taste and smell and feel ideas. Ah, Joseph Campbell was a-- also-- and he and I worked together for 28 years in giving seminars and panels and such. And he also, apart from visual imagery which he did not have, but he had very, very high kinesthetic. He was a great athlete imagery. And he would act-- that's why you have the hero's journey not the hero symbol cuz he was high kinesthetic. Ah, Linus-- not Linus Pauling, that was briefly, but, ah, ah, Buckminster Fuller was a research subject of mine. Uhm, Jonas Salk and other people whose name you wouldn't know. But all of these people were archaeologists of their own mind. They were spelunkers in the caves of their own creativity and like were fascinated by the way their minds work. You train people to activate the interior proprioceptors, the inner sensory system. And what happens is both purpose and creativity which seemed to come go hand and hand begin to rise. If I may use a metaphor, I would have to say that beneath the surface crust of consciousness, the creative process is going on all the time which is why I have certain, ah, resistance to thinking that it's all a kind of brain, ah, explosion. I think the brain is there sometimes to serve things that are beyond what we might think of is our brain. Imagination may lead us to what I call the imaginal level, the sophists refer to as the "alam al-mithal", the geopsychic realm, the original realm, the realm of the cosmos. Because we do not just live in the universe, the universe lives in us. And to try to separate us out as distinctive, you know, featherless bipeds running around apart from the universe, I think is a terrible mistake. But that we are cosmological beings. And so, when we tap it and we activate, I'm sure there's many exercises which I'm gonna show this afternoon when I do the three-hour seminar, ah, on the Wizard of Oz, the Wizard of Oz. When you activate interior imagery, so it would becomes rich and sexy and potent and succulent. Then, what happens is you simply have more hooks and eyes on the creative process whether it is your own imaginative or, ah, exploratory process, or ideas and images that seemed to rise from what Jung might have referred to as the collective unconscious or the collective consciousness but also could be rising, eyes believe, from the universe, the world itself. Cuz if we are all part of the singular living organism, then we have access to the ideas, the explorations, the, the possibilities of that larger organism. So it's a question of creating embodied exercises. Movement is critical because we are, we are more than we used to think of we, we are. Ah, and we know that as you can use imagery to change or health-- to help your body restore itself to more optimal condition. And as that condition changes so as your mood. I've been asked to say something that I would normally never say, and this is the first time I'm gonna it in public. It has gotten very embarrassing for me that I am close to 80 and I don't age. I just don't do it. That's-- part of it cuz I'm half-Sicilian and that's 4,000 years of olive oil. But he looks great, too. And he's Italian and he's 80. So, I mean, you know, part of it is genetic. But one of the reasons that I do not and I've been tested, and I test it has decades longer, younger than I am. Part of it is what I do, you know. Part of it is the orchestration not only of states of consciousness but also of, uhm, images of an optimal template that I can inhabit. Because-- ah, let's face it. Ah, we are the only mammals species that does not live to 10 to 12 times the age of puberty. And we probably should. I, I don't know that I wanna be 120 and-- though I had a lovely marriage and he finally died, you know, five years ago, after 43 years, I can't quite see starring at the same pla-- face over the breakfast table for a 140 years. But that's-- anyway, uhm, another aspect of purpose that rises from what I called "the field of inner intelligences, personalities, and capacities." You all know you have many different kinds of intelligence. Yes? Street smart, emotional intelligence, intuitive intelligence, analytical, mathematical, etcetera. And-- but these kinds of intelligences also allow you to access the various members of your inner cruew. If schizophrenia is a disease of the human condition, then maybe polyphrenia, the orchestration of our many, many other persona, ah, what Dr. Polster refers to the heterogeneous self. Maybe our expanded self. I'll give you an example from my own life, ah, about this polyphrenia cuz we are not encapsulated bags of skin dragging around dreary little egos. We are organism environments, I believe and we are symbiotic with the vast ecology of selves. Uhm, this insular self is actually a fairly recent invention. And, for example, I do a great deal of work with indigenous societies and they consider-- many of them consider as crazy those of the western because we have blocked off the rest of ourselves. Uhm, all right, example. I hate to write. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. But I've written a great deal. People say-- my new age friends say, "And do you channel your work?" I say, "I'd fight for every damn word you know." But, but, uhm, there's something that I am which is not a writer. I happened to be a very good cook. It's the two things I do very well in this world. I can talk to any dog and I'm a very good cook. And I'm very good cook because my mother, Maria Annunciata Serafina Graziella Fiorina Perpetua Todaro from Syracuse, Sicily married Jack Houston of Texas. They hated each other. They hated it. And to try to keep them together, I became the world's first fusion cook. And to try to keep them together, I became the world's first cook at making chicken fried polenta and things like that, you know. Now, so I became the fusion cook and I'm, I'm a very good cook. But I do not like to write. So the cook I actually assume absolutely or pretty a, a lot, a lot of it-- I-- my gene goes to the background and my cook comes to the foreground. And I stir in, a melange of flavors of ideas and I add the spices of different associations. And I have no blacks whatsoever particularly, you know. Now the fact is that you can learn how to access different persona cuz you have to play with it and you have at least suspend disbelieve. You know, you might say we're walking the edge of madness, yes, from a psychiatric point of view. But, creatively, it certainly works, that you can acquire very rapidly different skills sets I first acquiring and allowing these different persona. So, if I said to you how many of you are cooks? Have a cook inside you? How many of you have a mystic inside of you? How many of you hav a healer? How many of you have an athlete? A dancer? A singer? A writer? God help you. Yeah, he is a-- now, you see, we have so many selves. A wild man. A wild woman. A child. Very old wise being. And these different sets again allow a very different use of, of, of different possibilities. I mean, the continuum of creativity that is bubbling just beneath the surface of ordinary reality. There are so many techniques which I believe Dr. Rossi maybe referring to to tune in to this creativity. Ah, so these di-- inner experts or personas will help you navigate not just the complexity of life will give you a different know-how, a, a, a kind of innocent sensitivity with regard to purpose. Because ordinary same old, same old serial monotony of everyday waking consciousness. Your habit patterns of decades will often inhibit this sense of purpose whereas different realities within us will not. Another aspect is discovering the nature of your own mythic life and a lowny-- line-- lining with your destiny. My own autobiography is called "A Mythic Life". Calling upon the power of myth to help in realizing that your life is not a trivial story. You begin-- instead of moving beyond, instead of pathologizing, you mythologize. You see the largest story. And this will help you get back on your feet despite setbacks. How to travel beneath the surface of your everyday life to access the surging power of myth that is innate in the human condition? Now, dear old Joseph Campbell who talked about the hero's journey. And he and I used to have terrible fights about this because he insisted there is no heroin's journey. And I said there certainly is. They're just nicer, you know. You know, she takes care. She goes with the team, you know. She's not this lonely adolescent battling his own toxicities. She is there, you know. Ah, and I used as an example something that is my recent book, The Wizard of Oz-- I called The Wizard of Oz. And this is why my friends are dressed as wizards here. But the fact is look at you have. You have the classical journey. When it is called-- Dorothy has called beyond an outvoted situation of living in dreary, dust-written 1930s Kansas. In state of deep yearning, so the call is often one of your-- how many of you have yearned so deeply that something almost has to happen? And, of course, what happens is a tornado. Cuz sometimes you are kick out of little local self, little local situation by an inseemingly impossible situation. Tornado. And where does she arrive? She arrives in the kingdom. But the kingdom has problems. She arrives in a high sensate area totally unlike anything that she has ever seen before. So, this means her senses have to be activated which they are. She is deeply recognized. I mean, these little munchkins are running around doing radical darshan on her all the time, you know. And, and then of course the intelli-key shows up. The intelli-key is the deeper higher purposeful self often known as seen as an archetypal personification of oneself. And that would be Glinda. But also the negative, the demonic persona showing up as the witch because she always have this dialectic in archetypal structures between one and the other. In this case, it's the good witch and the bad witch. She is put on the road of spiritual pollen, the yellow brick road. Then immediately she meets the disempowered parts of herself, the disempowered mind cuz her-- she's a fine mind but it was never appreciated. The Scarecrow. The disempowered heart. Her enormous sympathy and empathy is empowered. The Tin Man. And of course, the disempowered state of courage cuz she has not yet known how to get out of that situation. And then, of course, together they are on the great road of trials, the classical journey, the road of adventures wherein they finally get to the optimal city of the Emerald City and are not allowed to be seen until they are willing to hang in there to see the wizard. They finally do and they are given the impossible task. How many of you have been absolutely impossible task when you had to really use your plucking, your cunning to get passed? And that's of course again the, the recapitulation of the great journey of getting rid, getting passed the guardian of the gate. And they finally get the witches broom. Thy bring it back and he will not do anything. Until they insist. Until they hang in there. Until the little dog who is really the one that has activated the whole journey pulls back the curtain. "Dog, look at that man behind that curtain!" But what happens? It's too late. And he gives them a tremendous psychotherapy. He shows them that they always had these high, high, high skills but they just didn't know it. And so they gave them the beautiful journey to discover that they had extraordinary mind, phenomenal heart, raging courage. And it turns out he's really not that great wizard but he's a tremendous psychotherapist. You know, when you look at that story. And then, of course, ultimately she finds that the Ruby's slippers were the way. With the help of her intelli-key, Glinda had to go home. And when she gets home, she says, "Oh, it was always in my own backyard!" Meaning the 1939 version of the creative unconscious of the human race that each of us resides in our own backyard. So one of the things that I do in me-- every culture that I work with is I find what is the core myth. If I'm working in India, I work with the Ramayana. If work in Australia with indigenous people, I work with the great stories of creation, the Dreamtime. I mean, wherever you go, you find what is the core story of a people. You see? And then when you work with individuals, you help them find their own unique personal mythology cuz myth is the coded DNA of the human psyche. It is the lure of the coming that gives us answers and possibilities beyond our old ways of being. It opens up the territory. It is a phenomenal and often fears and beautiful country that takes us into the realms of the self wherein we gain access from the personal particulars of our everyday life to the personal universals of great life. So, finally, the spiritual level. How to realize and cultivate your true nature and essence as embodied infinite. I sometimes think that the Selfing Game is what infinity does for fun. How to engage to spiritual practices? This is the first time in human history where we have a harvest of the wisdom and the spiritual practices of, of the whole world. It's never been there before. So, it maybe that I am turning with roomy rather than doing what was there in my childhood. Hail Mary, full of grace. Holy Mary, mother of god. It maybe that I am really seeing the extension of the female face of God whereas one really could not in the old ways. It maybe that some of you-- how many people here have flirted with Buddhism? How many of you actually got into it? How about sophism? How about native American who were indigenous people? How many of you invented your own religion? You let go of all the hands. But the fact is that we're in another axial age, the great axial age of the 64th century when you have within a very short period of time Buddha, Zoroaster, ah, Confucius, Lao Tzu, Parmenides, Pythagoras. When there is that rising of a sensibility of spirit and now it is happening all over the world. And I don't care if, if neurophysiologists say, "Well, it's just an inflation in the right hemisphere of the brain." I think that is a redacting, ah, and of certain-- we are more than that. We are organism environment symbiotic with a much larger field of being. And it's not for nothing that you have this rising sensibility of a renewed spirituality happening literally all over the world. So, finally, how to decode the emerging patterns? Several years ago, I was working with NASA actually training their major main scientists. I'm looking at the sensibility of being human from a cosmological point of view. And it was so fascinating how we really discovered that the cosmos is us. And the great patterns that orchestrate the cosmos are the same patterns that orchestrate us. We are-- maybe we are holographic beings. It it some-- maybe we are God seeds, if you will, incarnate in spacetime suits. In a God school. In a school of so much stress, torment, glory, beauty that we're being called to a much larger life. One of the ways you can find the performs of purpose is to track the great positive fractal themes of your life which reoccur time, and again, these themes of reoccurence. I'm a teacher, or I'm a traveler, or I'm one who is able to stand in a state of radical empathy before the other and I've been doing that since I was three years old. And not I'm talking about me, I'm talking about you. So that you can-- that you are availing yourself of some deeper purpose that has positioned to you in the spacetime continuum to open the journey for so many others. What is your positive fractal? Often, the positive repetitive fractals have to do with the major purposes of your life and how to work with them so as to benefit us in higher more successful ways. Old friends, we have actively move it to a time when we are ask to become worthy of the process that has been thrust upon us. That is that we have become response able for evolutionary and biological governance of this planet. Fifty years ago, no one could have predicted that it would have come upon us so fast. The world for which many of us have been prepared belongs not only to another era, it belongs to an entirely different frame of mind. One in which we needed far fewer capacities than we need today. One into which the calls and the sense of purpose were simpler and often does serving the needs of biology in the tribe. But then the calls coming our way have staggering import. And it is our luck of response to them that has led to very grave and enormous problems. Was Robert Walser said, "What is remarkable? What is remarkable about this era is not only the sculpt and urgency of our problems. It is that for the first time in millions of years of evolution. All the major threats to our survival are human caused. Problems like starvation, pollution, nuclear plants, nuclear weapons stemmed directly from our own behavior. And the hopes and fears, and phobias, and fantasies, and desires, and delusions that power this behavior. The state of the world in other words, reflects the state of our minds, the conflicts without us, reflects the conflicts within us as you as psychotherapist so deeply and richly know. So, but now friends, we find ourselves living in a time in which it seems-- and I really believe this from my work all over the world-- it seems that our very nature is in transition. The sculpt of change is calling for patterns and potentials at purposes in the human brain, mind, system that as far as we know were never need it before. Things that have to do with possibly living in a planetary or global society in which what we do profoundly makes a difference. None of us, are interest, are innocent of present history. Things that were relegated to the unconscious of becoming conscious. Things that belong to extraordinary experiences reality are becoming ordinary. And many of the maps of the human possibilities are undergoing awesome change. We are being called. We are being lured. I do believe, we are being primed with a sense of purpose. Thank you.

JEAN HOUSTON So, Mr. and Mrs. Rossi. 

00:41:00
CAMILLO LORIEDO Yes, Jean. 

00:41:00
JEAN HOUSTON What do you have to say? Well, they're on the front. Go ahead now. God ahed. 

00:41:10
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI I'm betwixt and between Jean. Should we have a little dialogue first, or shall I show some slides first to powerbacking you up... 

00:41:20
JEAN HOUSTON What do you wanna do? What do are you gonna do? 

00:41:20
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI Well, you're a towering personality. All of us have taken much inspiration from you. You're a model for so many of us. I'm thinking it might be nice if you could share with the audience how Jean Houston became Jean Houston. Are there are many memories from childhood from--example, that foreshadowed The Purpose Driven Life? Are there any members from teens when you were getting some ideas as a young adult? What-- or there any right foods? "Oh! This is how I..."

JEAN HOUSTON Well, now that you asked, that was not my intention, I wanted you to talk. All right. So I'm eighth years old. My father is the comedy writer. He's a comedy writer for, ah, Bob Hope and Jack Benny and people like that. Often, he was the only non-Jewish member of the comedy writer team. And they would say, "Hey, Jack! Hey, go issue uo the jokes so the hicks in Kansas understand them." So, he was the comedy goy. But anyway, uhm, he was also writing at one point the Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy Show. And he said to me, "Hey, kiddo! You wanna come with me and talk to Charlie?" How-- is anybody old enough to remember Charlie McCarthy? He was the, the little puppet, you know. So, and I said, "Yeah, Daddy. Let's go." So, we went and there was Bergen in his hotel room. We could see his face half, you know, from the side but he, he was so absorbed in what he was doing. He didn't see us enter. And he was talking to Charlie. Now, he wasn't rehearsing. He was asking Charlie ultimate questions. "Charlie, what is the nature of life? What does it mean to truly love? Charlie, where is the mind?" And this funny little dummy or saying, "Well, Oregon," and answering with the wisdom of thousands of years. And he would get so excited. "Yes, yes, but what is the difference between nature and spirit?" "Well, Bergen," you know, "great questions. Tremendous beautiful answers." Funny, my father, Jack Houston who was an agnostic Baptist, you know, couldn't stand it and he coughed. And Bergen turned around and he turned bit red. And he said, "Oh, hello, Jack. Hi, Jean. I see you caught us." And my father said, "Yeah, Edgar. What in the world are you doing?" He said, "Well, I'm, I'm talking to Charlie. He's the wisest person I know." And my father said, "Eh, that's you. That's you mind. In fact, you could see." When he was talking to Charlie his eyes were bugged out in wonder. "My mind was going on like that, you know." "Eh, that's you. It's your mind." He answered, "Well, I, I supposed ultimately it is, Jack. But you know when I asked him these questions and he answers, it's so much more than I know. I never know what he's going to say." And I thought, "Woah! I could feel that hair in my head rise. I know my preacher had come to funk." There's so much more beneath the surface crust of consciousness that we all have. And at that point, something in me clicked and I knew I had a dedication to explore and evoke to so much more. So, that was my, my tale from childhood. Adolescence, I won't go into a long story. But I ran into an old man who I called Mr. Teilhard when I was 14. And I knocked him down and I picked him up and he said, "Are you running to run like that for the rest of your life." I said, "Yes, sir. It looks that way." "Well, bon voyage. Bon voyage." Following we go as walking at my fox terrier chap." And he said, "Ah, my friend a runner. You have a fox terrier. I knew one many years ago. Where are you going?" "Well, I'm going to Central Park." "I will go with you. I will take my constitution." Well, he was something. He had no, he had no self-consciousness at all. None. And, ah, he had a long French name but it sounded to me like Mr. Teilhard, so I called him Mr. Teilhard. He would fall to the ground. "Oh, Jean, look, a caterpillar, hmm, moving, chancing, transforming, metamorphosis. Ah, Jean, can you feel yourself to be a caterpillar?" "Oh, very easily, Mr. Teilhard." You know, 14 years old, five, eight, 11 red dots on face. I feel like a caterpillar, you know. "Ah, what are you? Will you finally become a papillon, a butterfly?" When he said butterfly I was like, "Ah, yes, you know, you know, it is part of you." And this is the first time I heard the word intelli-key, your deeper purpose. "Well, I think when I'm, when I'm a papillon, a butterfly, ah, I'll, I'll fly all over the world and I hope people--" "Oh, no, no, no. Oh, Jean, sniff the wind same wind once sniffed by Jesus Christ." I said, "Jesus Christ sniff this wind. I'll better hold my breath, you know." "Ah, I'm a Marie Antoinette, ah, Voltaire, lot of French people. And when, ah, Genghis Khan. Not so good. Joan of Arc be filled with the tides of history." And we would-- he would-- we would go into the mu-- not the museum, the 64 Street Zoo and we would-- he would go through all the stages of evolution, you know, of the animals and birds and things and finally look at a baby and say, "The next stage. The next stage." Everything was filled with meaning around him. He had me reading Alfred North Whitehead adventures and ideas and Lecomte Du Noüy on Human Destiny. And the last time I saw him, cuz we walked often on for three years, I had it in the shell of a snail and he went to rupture. And he talked about the floor and shark, cathedral, and the galaxies, and the brain, and the world, pattern of flowers, the great, great spiral of becoming. And finally he said, "Omega. Omega. Omega." And he gave me back the shell. He said, "Oh, what Jean?" I said, "Oh, we're warm Mr. Teilhard. I'll see you on Tuesday." And the dog didn't wanna go. And the dog going, "Uhmm, uhmm, uhmm, uhmm." "Come on, Jim. Come on. Come on." "Uhmm, uhmm." Ah, Tuesday I waited for him, he did not show up. Thursday I waited, he did not show up. Eight weeks I waited, he never showed up. He had died that is the Sunday I did not know it. It should have been on April, 1955. And years later, somebody gave me a book without a cover called The Phenomenon of Man. I read it. It was too familiar. Metamorphosis. Newsberry(ph) kept talking about omega. And he-- and finally she gave me the cover. And there was no forgetting that man, Mr. Teilhard had been, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin who lived across the street from the-- out of, out of Park Avenue. So, he would with his sense that we are not just human beings having a spiritual experience, that we are spiritual beings having a human experience and tracking it through the great structures and designs of evolution. That is what certainly was a very, very deep, deep pattern in my life. And that is you Ro-- Er-- Ernesto, como esta? Como. Tanto bene cosi. Eh. 

00:49:05
CAMILLO LORIEDO She wants you. 

00:49:05
JEAN HOUSTON Or Kathryn. Come. 

00:49:05
KATHRYN LANE ROSSI We'll all come. 

00:49:05
JEAN HOUSTON We'll all come. 

00:49:10
KATHRYN LANE ROSSI The wizard understood the wizard. 

00:49:15
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI Thank you, Jean. 

00:49:15
KATHRYN LANE ROSSI We're all wizards, too. We're all wizards together. 

00:49:20
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI We are the support system, the scientific support system. 

00:49:25
KATHRYN LANE ROSSI You have a microphone. 

00:49:30
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI Oh, I have a microphone. Oh, where did... 

00:49:30
KATHRYN LANE ROSSI It's a miracle. 

00:49:30
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI Thank you. 

00:49:30
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI Okay. The Purpose Driven Life that Jean is talking about this morning, it has a fantastic history goes back a long time of course. It goes back to Lao Tzu and ancient China. It goes back to Buddha in India. It goes back to Christ. Always these forerunners talking about a new life. There was Moses, there was Mohammed. All of them bringing us new calls. So, it occurs to me especially-- what is different at this time, Jean? How do we know we are in a new world? You say, the univer-- we were living in the universe, there's also a universe inside of us. How come? How did that evolve? Well, this is what we wizards have been doing in the background. We're trying to find the scientific basis of the universe out there as well as the universe inside.

Facilitating RNA/DNA Epigenomics of Creating New Consciousness 2013 Evolution of Psychotherapy: Point/Counterpoint #6 • Δ Observing Consciousness → • Δ Mirror Neurons → Δ Gene Expression/Protein Synthesis Cycle • → • Δ Brain Plasticity 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:50:55
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI So, if I show this first slide, is that going to be possible? Oh, here we go. So, here is I believe Jean Houston in that nutshell. On the top, we have observing consciousness, the sensory perceptual world that she talks about as the first level. Then, we have this consciousness reflecting the universe, the neu-- neuroscientist calls them the mirror neurons. And these mirror neurons somehow translate our sensations, our perceptions, our mind, our thoughts, and here we come to an essence of it. Our mind and thoughts that reflect the outside world turned on what the scientist calls RNA. RNA? What is that? Will you all know what DNA is? RNA was there before DNA. And it's RNA that's delivering that arrow from observing consciousness to the mirror neurons and that is a new kind of RNA that's turning on gene expression, the DNA. And that gene expression makes new proteins that build the new cells in the brain, and that's we today call the brain plasticity. Standard cells in the brain, under those cells, in response to sensory perceptual and psychological processes, now sympathize mature into new brain cells. They create new neuron networks and this becomes a basis of observing conscuiousness. So, we have a complete cycle from observing consciousness today turning on our mirror neurons, turning on the RNA. The RNAs carries that message from the outside world into our genes and turns on certain patterns of genes to make new brain cells, for what, to form new neuron networks. They are willing to create new observing consciousness. Let's see if I can get this thing to work.

CREATING CONSCIOUSNESS HOW THERAPISTS CAN FACILITATE WONDER, WISDOM, TRUTH & BEAUTY SELECTED PAPERS OF ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI Volume 2, 2006-2012 EDITED BY KATHRYN LANE ROSSI HEALING TRANSFORMATIONS A 100 YEARS PSYCHOLINGUISTIC STUDY 

00:53:45
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI Okay. So, this is one of my recent books, Creating Consciousness: How Therapists can Facilitate Wonder, Wisdom and Beauty. Is this the inspiration, Jean, would you say we're looking for that wonder, for that beauty, that inspires, that fascinates us? In this book, I try to get to some of the science background. Here is a wonderful study of the past 100 years from the Google new tool of the N-grams of 5 billion books from around the world up to current periodicals measuring how often different words were recorded. And what we see here is since 1950. The big leaping purple curve going up is DNA. This is a kind of objective evidence that, yes, DNA is very important to, to current consciousness. Right below it, the green line, the cognitive. How amazing that there's a connect-- is there a connection between DNA and a cognitive? That's what, we, little wizards have been trying to figure out because this becomes the basis of medicine, in particular, translational medicine. And you see over the past 100 years, medicine has been progressing at a leisurely pace and now it's being pulled up by DNA and the cognitive. Then, coming down, lay down, I'm sorry to say-- we talked about meditation. We talked about the psychotherapy. We talked about the hypnosis. Oh, my goodness! We also talked about hypnosis on the floor. These are all languages lead by the DNA cognitive connection. Some people cu-- in cultures call it meditation, we in our culture call it psychotherapy or counseling. And you know what's behind that psychotherapy that my own gene coni-- the indication. And we say, it's-- well, it's a placebo. You've-- I feel good. But what is a placebo? Hyno-- hypnotherapists trying to focus that placebo. But notice it's been hovering and just barely making it. How do we enhance our meditation, psychotherapy, placebo, hypnosis? This is what the wizards are trying to figure out.

RNA/DNA BIRD SONG DYNAMICS Micro RNAs RESPOND to THOUGHT 

00:57:05
ERNEST ROSSI So, now we have two darling birds and this was the first insight, the first inkling I had of the new RNA/DNA Theory of Consciousness and Mind-Body Healing. There was a researcher, a bird researcher, birdsong researcher, and here are two lovely finches, the same kind of finches by the way that Darwin study years ago. I always see the male finch has lot more colors. The female finch is a little bit more dowdy. But we-- there's no mistake in this body language. This guy-- this pretty guy has get-- he got a strong tweet to this potential lady but the lady is holding back. She's not so sure. She likes his song. She's gonna take her to hymn about whether she's gonna become his mate. Well, it all depends upon his song. Does she likes his song? How did this little guy learn his song? Well, what's when he was a little twittower? He'd listened to his daddy. And he said thoughts, "Someday I'm gonna grow up, bit big and pretty like my daddy but I gotta learn his song." And so, he grunts and he tweets and he starts getting an approximation of his daddy's song. But you know, the little guy, wonderful and brightest, he has-- he makes mistakes, so his song isn't quite like his daddy's. He's evolving into a new generation. His individual song is different. He makes different mistakes than other guys in his generation. So, what is this little female? She is listening to what an essence. It's his identity. Does his song pleased her? She doesn't know anything about evolution. She doesn't know that, that individuality that created him actually was a series of quantum processes upon certainty than actually led to mistakes. But the mistakes are creating a new melody, a new psychosocial synthesis. Now, when researchers studied, oh, what's happening in the female at its great new song? It's being sung only for her. 

01:00:05
eRNA/DNA MIND & BABY SONG 

01:00:10
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI They found that as a trace to map the sound in the female's brain, it goes to s-- auditory area of course and it starts turning on RNA. What-- what's RNA got to do with it? Well, the RNA now becomes a molecular messenger to turn on the DNA to adapt to new life circumstances. This has been known for about three or four years how we got the bird model. Now we know the mother who is singing those early nursery rhymes to her baby. 

01:01:00
KATHRYN LANE ROSSI Itsy bitsy spider went up the waterspout. 

01:01:05
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI What is the mother doing? She's giving the baby cognitive training that starting to turn further RNAs. And these RNAs are turning DNA to facilitate the babies new protein and new brain structures. And those brain structures are beginning even in the womb. So, a newborn baby will turn his head to its mother in the direction of his mother's place. So, the incredible wonder of this. We can trace now from daddy's message to mother, and now mother to child by now the cognitive. So, you-- this is what new. This is what the new transformative consciousness today. Lao Tzu didn't know about this. Buddha didn't know about this. They created beautiful metaphors. Yes, motherhood is wonderful. But now we're learning the molecular dynamics behind the myths behind the sagas. So, we go from the sensory perceptual to the psychological, from the psychological to the molecular, picking up, making sense of all the myths of the past, and then we go on to... 

01:02:50
4-Stage Creative Process Novelty-Numiosu-Neurogenesis Effect 

01:02:55
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI Well, that little baby grows up the human baby, it continually goes to a process that we call "the four-stage creative process." Many years ago, people like Leonardo da Vinci first talked about the creative process, it was in seven stages he said. And then, other people on modern-- our era said, "Well, it's-- yes, it's the monomyth of mankind and that was Joseph Campbell and he can dance clear all da Vinci's seven stages into four-- to six stages. Then I came along in the early '60s and '70s and I reduced it. And my very first papers published in the Journal of Humanistic Psychology, I said we can reduce it to just four stages. And these four stages are actually the creative foundation of psychotherapy. Psychotherapy is as a creative process. And this was back in the late 1960s, the Journal of Humanistic Psychology. I mean, it's obvious what's happening here. This is a diagram I got from a science magazine. It's actually five stages. But the first stage of the creative process the-- is the wheels are turning in the mind? Then, the students starts scribbling. And this illustrates the Pythagorean theorem. So those two are the first fascination, interest as Jean Houston talks in her presentation. It lures interest, fascination, mysterious, and has a tremendous pull on us. But then he truly creative process. Stage two is this middle panel. And here we see what. The, the student is obviously stuck. He-- and he's working hard, so hard that smoke has coming out of his brain, his brain. Well, of course, this is a cartoon. But, remember, Leonardo da Vinci centuries ago, he said there was a stage in the middle when the brain "se fumo", it smokes. In other words, there was a heat. There was an activity driving the brain. And it was humorous since it smokes. So, later on that da Vinci had these ideas centuries ago. And then coming up to our present age, we discover that after this hot piece of work, boom, there's a flash of light. The cartoonist plans out how the student drops his pencil and his pen. And surprise! He's surprised by this flash of wonderful insight. It seems to come out of-- and stage four, look how happy she is. She says, "Magic! Bravo!" It seems like magic. It came all by itself. She forgets that just maybe half an hour ago, she was sweating it out. She was in stage two. This is a difficult stage. So, all of us go through this everyday. And the main thing I found out from Erickson was that this has-- this process usually last about an hour and a half. And so I spent all the 1980s after Erickson passed on, is there really a cycle biological basis of the creative process? And does it take about an hour and a half which was Erickson's typical psychotherapy length session? 

01:07:10
4-STAGE RNA/DNA THEORY MIND/GENE DIALOGUES 1 Mind Crisis & Opportunities 2 eRNAs Mirror Neurons Intuition 3 HARs Epi-genomics Adapt & Heal 4 DRD4 Brain & Body Insight & Applications 

01:07:15
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI To all that, I would answer of course, yes. I eventually in the late '80s and '90s. I edited volumes of the mind, body, rhythms with David Loy, the professor of microbiology in England. And this is the latest iteration of that research. We edited researchers from around the globe that were doing the top notch research. And we finally got a molecular basis for the four-stage creative process. When people come to us, they're in a crisis that's why they're coming to us. "Help me. Please, help." And that's our job. Our job is to turn their crisis into opportunities. Helping the client recognize they're in a resources. What are we doing thereby? We're actually-- meaning the mind mirror neurons are seem to turn on RNAs. And these RNAs will turn on epigenomics. The human accelerated region just recently within our generation, researchers have found that there's a special part of the-- our genome that's different from our nearest relatives, the chimpan-- chimpanzees. So, these human accelerator noticed a name, human accelerator. What it's accelerating? It's accelerating a communication from mind to mirror neurons to the genes. What for? To produce a new protein, to new neurotransmitters, to new hormones. One of them in particular, with the so role of it to what Dr. Houston talks about is the dopamine receptor chain. DRD4. What is that? That's a gene that was turned on by novelty situations. Why does Dr. Houston talked about fascination, wonder, the mysterious? Actually, there was a German scholar called. His name was Rudolf Otto. Back in 1923, he published a book called "The Idea of the Holy". What did he mean by that? Well, he was a theologian. He's studying the lifetime of Christ, Moses, Mohammad. Any leader of a new religious movement-- and what was it that inspired those spiritual process? I see, I have 15 minutes? 

01:10:25
KATHRYN LANE ROSSI Well, actually Ernie, there's people in the audience there dying to ask questions. 

01:10:30
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI Oh, okay. 

01:10:30
KATHRYN LANE ROSSI You see it. So... 

01:10:30
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI Well he... 

01:10:30
KATHRYN LANE ROSSI And also... 

01:10:35
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI I'll stop here. This is the essence of a new RNA/DNA theory. We'll be talking more about it this afternoon in workshop 11 and tomorrow in the workshop 12 in our point counterpoint with Cloé Madanes. This is just a foretaste. Let's hear where we can go to with the tunes, inspiration, and the, the new connects with the molecular genomics of human existence. 

01:11:05
JEAN HOUSTON It's wonderful. Thank you so much Ernie. Just brilliant. Brilliant. See friends, we're a full service organization here. You get the mind. You get the body. You get the biology. Uhm, this is the question time. So, questions-- are there stations where people can ask questions or you just shout and hope to be heard? Where are the red flag-- where are the red flags? Okay, so you can ask questions of, ah, Ernest Rossi or myself or both of us. Yes, speak as louder as you can cuz it's not coming on. I'll repeat the question. 

01:11:45
 It seems to me this conference should be called The Evolution of Consciousness rather The Evolution of Psychotherapy which is a lot more as parochial. But I'm wondering, this emergent of consciousness, is it so robust that it is really not as dependent upon our anticipation as we seemed to think? 

01:12:05
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI Is it so robust-- I'm sorry-- there's a, there's a feedback. 

01:12:10
 Yes. Is this emerging consciousness so strong, so robust that it isn't as dependent upon our anticipation as we like to think? 

01:12:20
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI See. Did you hear the question? Is, is this emergence of consciousness so robust that it does not necessarily depend on our participation. It just is. I think it's both end plus much, much more. Certainly, in my work around the world, I see a fascination often with different metaphors of the whole notion of consciousness. Ah, my friend where I have to be tomorrow with the, ah, departure where I do seminar together, calls summoning the sacred and he has launched this big consciousness movement. Uhm, I, I think it's something-- it's, it's timing. It's something that whose time has come. Because quite frankly, if we do not elevate what we call consciousness, at least conscious of consciousness, we're in for a very bad time. If we keep on same old, same old, ah, where say culture has become a satellite to economics instead of economics being the satellite of culture. Ah, I, I see a sort of more or less out of here within 200 years. I mean, it will be a million of us looking like Quasimoto, you know, stumbling over abandoned electronic appliances. But it maybe that-- maybe-- all right, let me create a, a myth for you. Let's suppose it's a 1,000 years in the future, and a young woman is taking whatever is the equivalent of the doctorate in planetary organization. And she now has access to say a 100 planets with high civilizational development. Of course, they all look very different but they're there. And she sees that there is this tremendous period of, of, ah, speciation. Great many species emerging and there are some dominant species like here is the humanoids. Others, ah, maybe look-- they may look different. But-- and then you the females creating a great many replications of themselves. And at certain, point you reach a place where the planet can no longer sustain that. When you have the rise of-- then the male and the female of the species and the rare fact that the level of challenge, of complexity, of crisis has reached a point that it cannot go much further and there's all kinds of wobblings around the planet, then their emerges out of this level of crisis and ferment, just as in the punctuated equilibrium which I talked at, a massive rise of psyche in which the symbols of different cultures rise. Spiritual technologies, meta-technologies, scientific technologies, all are coming together at the same time. Is it at that point that the world mind begins to take a walk with itself, as for example, is happening now. And not just in terms of visiting other cultures but the rise of the internet, Facebook, ah, who knows what they're called in other, you know, other realms. So, that she does he that, that is that, that point where the male and female get together in a reasonable level of co-creative ecology. There is a sufficiency of the science to sustain it. It is then that the jump time is reached and the consciousness begins another order of consciousness rise. So, their effect that were linked, you know, I coughed and somebody in Vietnam sees it. It's, it's, it's, it's-- we are in a hyperlinked world. It is both angelic and demonic, but it is happening. So I just wonder whether the external forms of consciousness relating has not activated the internal cook forms both of the collective rise of consciousness as well as a kind of, uhm, time release capsule. I used a metaphor advisedly in which then consciousness and cosmos begin to come together and actuate a, a, a movement toward not only complexity but to connectivity. But at the same time, that's happening. Radical and radical entropy also rises, so we could lose it all cuz we're finding now having just gone through the most-- the bloodiest century, you know, in history. So, do I believe that there is an autonomous force whether you call it god, whether you call it consciousness, and you call that the cosmic mind that has minding it all, whether you call it this-- the particular evolutional, uhm, experience at this space and time, I believe that that is true. And that's why I say this is the most interesting and challenging time in human history because we could lose it. And I think that it is conferences like this that as I think you rightly say our addressing this issue of not just psychotherapy but even a kind of mesotherapy which is becoming conscious of the conscious shifts in space, time, and in psyche. Next question. 

01:17:50
 Uhm, I work a lot with adolescents in Virginia adults and I was wondering if what you're talking about how that intersects with the seemingly appear-- uhm, emerging trend of a, a theorem being ordinary and desiring in external-- extraordinary to be extraordinary. 

01:18:15
JEAN HOUSTON Ah, what an interesting question. 

01:18:15
 And if, if - 

01:18:15
JEAN HOUSTON Yeah. 

01:18:15
 - maybe that desire is more of the surface level, and more missing that point completely. In what you're talking about, I'm missing the, the deeper level - 

01:18:25
JEAN HOUSTON Yeah. 

01:18:25
 - based on that. 

01:18:25
JEAN HOUSTON Well, if you look at the Superman music of movies, the Iron Man, ah, all these movies of metamorphs, people who are in stage of trend, redoing their physical systems so that they can be stronger, more powerful, etcetera. I think that's a pop version of transformation. But I think that what that is speaking to is the transformational imperative that maybe part of who and what and where we are on the planet at this time. Ah, you've always had that in times of radical transition. The pop metaphor of the unique person has always emerged in many, many, many cultures. And we see this, by the way, all over the world. It's all over Japan, for example, the pop metaphor of the-- pop metaphor of the metamorph. Uhm, but I think also, ah, what I see, you know, with young people around the world is a desire to serve. I mean, I find it just a phenomenal thing. Now, I was a girl scout till I was 18 years old. I was selling cookies while I was reading Hegel, you know, for God's sake. But-- and I found that, that kind of guidance is, is remarkable. I've just created something which is called launch out, ah, which was going on or it's starting all over the world for young people to learn different forms of human development and social development and to serve. If you allow for service and you give opportunities for service where people can really take their late adolescence and emerging adulthood and we put it to real work, I think that-- well, I have seen, I have seen the, the extraordinary growth and transformation. Do you wanna address this also - 

01:20:15
CAMILLO LORIEDO What's, what's the, what's the question? 

01:20:20
JEAN HOUSTON - or, or Kathryn? 

01:20:20
KATHRYN LANE ROSSI Uhm, well the, the, the question, the question Ernie is, is about the, ah, ah, you know, the, the emergence in teenagers - 

01:20:30
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI Yes. 

01:20:30
KATHRYN LANE ROSSI - and, uhm, and you know, wanting to be extraordinary. 

01:20:35
ERNEST LAWRENCE ROSSI Yes. This is exactly what I was talking about when I talked about DRD4. That's the gene system that turns on responsiveness to novelty. That's teenager that wants to be extraordinary has a lot of talent. They have a lot of what they follow. A lot of leaders. What are they doing with all their cellular communication? They're looking for movie stars or looking for scientists. They're looking for leaders. And as these leaders that are like a mother feeding them some inspiration that's gonna turn on the RNA, to turn on the DNA, and in particular, the human accelerator DNA that's gonna make the kind of neurotransmitters that come out of the DRD4 genes. Do you begin to see how extraordinariness-- in the beginning, it's how alive, how good your genes and seem what's new. And then that what's new, if you have the courage to pursue it to follow your passion that some people like Campbell said, "Yes, follow your passion." But it's more than just sexual passion that was Freud's idea is more than our type of structuring that was Young's idea. Genes embrace all of them. And what we're presuming to do is find the molecular dynamics between a thought, a perception, something interesting in the outside world. You like music and while the first time you hear something of Beethoven, for example, or Bach, you're inspired. "Wow! Is this the human spirit?" So this is what's behind the arts. So many people talk about how they arts are different than the sciences. But all the artists just as scientists are inspired by the novel, the new, the mysterious.
