The Evolution of Psychotherapy Workshop 37 Reality is Negotiable: Absorbing People in Positive Possibilities with Michael D. Yapko, Ph.D. Sunday, December 15, 2013 

00:00:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Good morning everybody. 

00:00:00
UNKNOWN Good morning. 

00:00:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Sunday morning, 9 o'clock-- 9:15, day five of this conference. Are your brains fried yet? 

00:00:10
UNKNOWN Slight. 

00:00:10
MICHAEL D. YAPKO I can tell you that by the time we get around to doing the group hypnosis you're gonna be real happy to get there. It's like, "Finally, I get a few minutes of peace here, you know." Somebody wri-- someone in my last workshop say, "Can we stop the workshop? My brain is full." Not quite yet. Okay, well anyway good morning and thank you so much for coming out on this Sunday morning. It has been a fantastic conference, hasn't it? Yeah. It's been, ah, so many smart people all in one place and then there are the presenters. Uhm, ah, so, it-- it's really, ah, been treat our heads, so many great conversations with people in the hallways and few people that showed in my shower this morning. Then I was just it couldn't-- out people everywhere. So let's just been great. Anyway, that you have topic for this morning is, you know, is to talk about hypnosis and, ah, I'd like to share some observations with you about things that have been going on in the field, things that may, ah, I don't think will surprise any of you unless you really haven't been much in touch with the literature in, in recent years but, ah, you know, hyp-- hypnosis goes through these ups and downs in terms of people's acceptance and interest. 

00:01:40
How do people generally regard hypnosis? It's a mixed reaction from both professionals and the general public; a curiosity about hypnosis mixed with skepticism and misapprehension based on commonly held misconceptions 

00:01:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO And when we look at the, ah, general way that people regard hypnosis is such a mixed reaction which is, "Oh, he's so curious to me." People that are curious about it on one hand and afraid of it on the other hand and the last thing that I would ever want is for somebody to be afraid of what's going on inside their own mind or to be afraid of, of what's going on inside their own internal subjective phenomenology but, ah, that peculiarity, you know, what other field faces things like, you know, if, if you go to Las Vegas and you see all these X-rated hypnosis shows, they're doesn't really portray hypnosis in the best light. In, in other fields just don't face that, you know, you go to Las Vegas so there are no X-rated mindfulness shows. They just, you know, they've-- they're just, just aren't and yet-- the one of the things I'll talk about in greater depth is that when you look at mindfulness and when you look at hypnosis, the amount of overlap is huge. The differences are far smaller than the similarities and there too you have a process in which you secure someone's attention. You grab someone's attention and you start to direct it in ways that invite the person to start to engage what different qualities of experience than they normally engage with. So to start to focus someone on the merits of compassion, to start to orient someone to the experience of empathy and these are experiential processes, it's not something, it-- it's isn't logical. The whole thing about these approaches is they defy logic. People have abilities to respond in ways that you would never predict. Things that don't really make a lot of sense and sometimes are quite unpredictable. I'm just curious, how many of you are at the demonstration I did in the arena the other day? Quite a few of you. Now for those of you that were there, you see what I'm talking about, I meet this woman for the first time, she gives me really very little information-- I'll tell about that in, in, ah, a moment but you know, I also respect the fact that when I'm doing clinical demonstrations, the last thing that I wanna do is just unzipped somebody and have their guts spill out on the stage. So how much information do you need to really have a sense of what the person's goals are, what they need and you know, she is presenting trust issues. Well, you know, one of the things that people often called Erickson kind of a mind reader but it isn't mind reading at all. If I'm your new client and I walk in, sit down and I do this. 

00:05:05

00:05:10
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Before I finally say, "I have trust issues." If I don't tell you anything else, what do you know? What do you know is in this person's background? Predictably, betrayal, we don't know the content, we don't know when, we don't by whom, we don't under what conditions and we don't need too. All of that is content. It helps for the person to be able to tell the stories so you gonna get to hear the content anyway but my point is if this person says nothing else. Got it. You were betrayed by somebody who, who you trusted, somebody violated that trust and now you response to it was to form the over generalization that nobody can be trusted. Now, anyone of you is a clinician would wanna say to this person some variation of, there are lot of wonderful people out there who can be trusted and there are a lot of people out there who are not nice people and they can't be trusted and your job is to learn how to tell who's who. And here's the empowerment side of the equation, I want you to be somebody and you have the ability to assess them, note who they are and what they're capable of before you invest in ways that make you vulnerable. The whole idea of being in an intimate relationship with someone is to be vulnerable with someone who's not gonna take advantage to that vulnerability but if you have that hypervigilant global don't trust anybody, you're the one who suffers that you're always have in a look around for where are you gonna get blind-sighted next. So in a sense that's what happen in that session. She starts telling me about the people who haven't live up to her expectations about what they should do, how they should be and all those things. And to use the hypnosis to introduce the possibilities that you can start to develop the skills of having more realistic expectations for people, you can sharpen your assessments skills to know who's trustworthy and who isn't. You can marshal the resources when you have intelligently trusted someone and they'd betrayed you anyway that the you have the resources of resilience, the ability to bounce back. Now, if you say to somebody very clearly, very logically, "Hey, you can bounce back." That's when they'll flip your recording and say, "Thanks for seeing me." What you're saying is technically correct, you can develop the resources to bounce back and love again or do whatever else you need to but how do we take that as a logical piece of input that is entirely correct and bring it to life and that's what the experience of hypnosis has meant to do. How do we take these ideas and have them be felt experiences? How do we take these ideas and have them be things that operate multidimensionally? Now that's certainly part of doing psychotherapy. We want our psychotherapeutic interventions to be multidimensional. We don't want to just approach people cognitively as much as I love cognitive therapy and as much it's well integrated into my books, my work. Cognitive therapy has one fairly serious limitation built right into it. It's so cognitive. And that doesn't take away its value but it's a point-- it's a foundational component of experience. We need to deal with the quality of people's thinking but we also need to deal with the quality of their feeling and we also need to deal with the quality of their behavior and we also need to deal with the quality of their relationships and we also need to help them contextually when they walk in the situations that they don't feel empowered to handle. So that when we look at all the different dimensions of experience, cognitive, behavioral, effective, relational, symbolic, contextual, historical, now the question is, at any given moment in an-- in an intervention where do we wanna aim the treatment? What's gonna be the most valuable for this person to be able to experience and learn from and in that respect this is I think of principle point in this. 

00:10:35
How do people generally regard hypnosis? It's a mixed reaction from both professionals and the general public; a curiosity about hypnosis mixed with skepticism and misapprehension based on commonly held misconceptions 

00:10:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO The first misconception that people have about hypnosis is I think is that they think of hypnosis as a therapy. People who even used the term hypnotherapy, you'll notice I don't use the term hypnotherapy cuz to me it doesn't say anything. Hypnosis is a vehicle for delivering ideas. If you think about that session that many of you saw that session was a cognitive behavioral intervention done hypnotically orienting her to the idea that there are people who can be trusted but if you have the expectation that this person is gonna look out for you and you've never really assessed is this person capable of that quality of selflessness then you gonna get hurt because if you think love conquers all and you assumed this person is capable of deep love, I mean, this is-- this is one of the things that we have to acknowledge as people don't come with all of the equipment they need to live well. Not everybody knows how to love. Not everybody knows how to be selfless. Not everybody is character logically generous and even questions like how deep are people capable of being. So many therapist operate on what I call the hidden gem hypothesis that if you dig deeply and often someone you'll find others valuable stuff. The problem is that there are a lot of people that deep down they're very superficial. So that's part of having a better understanding of what is this person capable of. Now, if I simply say that to someone, "Hey, before you get attached to someone it will be good to know what they're capable of doing and not capable of doing." And they'll certainly accept that idea. It's self-evident, it's sensible but now how do we instill in this person a reflexive response that when they meet someone and their little heart starts to go pitter-patter, that something bubbles up that says, "I'm really attracted to this person which is great and there's so much I don't know about this person." All kinds of things that could be a deal breaker. You have no way of knowing whether under he's three-piece suit. He's wearing a bra and panties. Things that might make a difference to you. So, you know, it's gonna take a little while in how do we build the impulse control, how do we build the frustration tolerance, how do we build the kinds of skills that make it easy for someone to get connected and stay connected in the healthiest of ways. And so, what I'm really describing to you is the value of hypnosis and I say hypnosis and it wouldn't matter to me if we're talking about mindfulness or guided imagery or visualization or any of these experiential approaches that differ in content but are structurally identical. And so, well, I'm hoping I can provide in this short time that we're together is a sense of what I mean by the structure. The differences between content, the details that you give people and the structural experiences. So you, you can talk to somebody about each of their failed marriages or each of their failed relationships and here's what happened in marriage number one and here's what happened in marriage number two and here's what happened in marriage number three and you can deal with the different details of what went wrong in each relationship. But on a whole different level if we change something introduce shifts into how this person chooses who they get attached to, it's obviously gonna change what happens and it's those structural shifts that are so interestingly amenable in hypnosis that happen in faster ways. You know, many of people were surprised in the demonstration, a couple of people even commented on it afterwards when I opened it up to questions of how was it possible to so quickly get to the shifts that she reported and how she felt about the issue of trust when we were done. I'd-- I didn't talk to her about the disappointments with her spouse and the disappointments with their kids and the disappointments with I could of but I was there to demonstrate hypnosis. First of all, I had one hour and it seemed to me the most useful use the time was can I introduce the shift, a possible shift in the way that she thinks about how she defines her relationships with other people to be more self-aware of what our expectations are and what her needs are to know what you want and need in a relationship and then to be skilled enough in assessing to find out, can this person do this? Can this person do this? We're not doing it because they're, ah, malicious, necessarily, a lot of times people just don't know any better but that's what so curious to me is as I'm describing hypnosis to you now as a process of absorption. The capacity to get experientially absorb, a much more multidimensional approach based on what your aimed up. So in one hypnosis session I might be aiming at shifting or introducing different quality of cognition, a different thought pattern. In another session, I'm working with someone's emotions to either help them express them or even back enough to encourage emotional differentiation, do you even know what you're feeling? And you say hypnosis on an emotional level. Somebody else comes to see me, there in physical pain. So many of the people that I work with terminal cancer patients, people with their mask, people with various debilitating diseases and conditions that are painful and I'm using hypnosis to shift physiology and shifts sensory awareness and in fact, that might surprise some of you that is the empirically supported application of hypnosis is in the world of pain - management. Volumes written about it and why most pain treatment centers have a full time hypnosis person there because hypnosis for pain management works so well. And it goes beyond mindfulness or imagery or visualization because it adds in a very different elements, the quality of dissociation. You wouldn't do a mindfulness session with someone and then, wheeled them into the operating room to have their body cut open surgically, with hypnosis that's done routinely. There are many physicians in many places where hypnosis is used either as the soul anesthetic or as a primary anesthetic in major surgical procedures. Now, when you see that done it's extraordinary. I've been at this 40 years, I have seen things that would knock your socks off. Things that while I'm watching it, I'm saying to myself, "No way." There's no way and I'm gonna show you one of those in the second hour and you-- and while you're watching it, you're gonna go, risky, tingle, fast track. So, the, ah, help people generally regard hypnosis people have an experience about or even clinicians, you know, people who think of hypnosis is somehow outdated, some people and somehow think that hypnosis is doing something to someone that it's robbing the person of their choices or individuality and nothing could be further from the truth and, and for those of you that watch the session use-- you know, what I'm talking about. It's not-- it, it parallels therapy entirely. You're introducing possibilities to people. I can't make someone relax. I can't make someone focus. All I can do is introduce possibilities to people. So to be able to say to someone gently perhaps you could experience this and maybe possible for you to notice more this. I wouldn't be surprised if it occurred to you that very easy and respectful kinds of suggestions about what somebody might consider. It's no different in what any of you would do. You know, when, when you say to your client on the way out the door, pat around the back and say, "Have good week." That's a nice suggestion probably a little more authoritarian then I would use I might be more incline to say, it's entirely possible that you could have a great week but when you think about how many different ways there are to say something and this is what the study of hypnosis in composes. You're studying the language, you're studying the effects of language and when you look at the extraordinary array of neuroscientific research about what's going on in people's brains, when you use language that is sensory based compared to when you don't, that if I say, " that man has hands like leather." It creates a very different MRI signature then if you say, "that man has strong hands." If I say, "the singer she has the most velvety smooth voice." He has a very different signature then if you say, "She is a good singer." So the quality of language, now with the nu-- the recent advances in neuroscience be actually be able to look at what happens if we use language that's more cognitive and in electoral and detached versus language that is more sensory based and experiential, something that has been advocated in the field of hypnosis forever. There just wasn't the evidence for it. There was the report of the clients of how much better they got into it and it was like that more sensory based and experience for them but now there is the actual neuroscientific evidence. 

00:23:10
Unfortunately, people react to the word, not the experience The baggage (i.e., negative associations) of the word "hypnosis" 

00:23:10
MICHAEL D. YAPKO So, in, in, in that respect for the people who haven't really gotten the sense of what the field of hypnosis is about. They react to the word not the experience and I always find that troublesome of course, you say to somebody, "You want to do hypnosis," and they went themselves and went screaming from your office. You say, "You wanna do some focusing and relaxation?" They go, "Cool." They never respond to the description of the experience negatively, they just react to the word hypnosis. So from here on I'm just gonna call it rough, okay. We're, we're talking about rough processes today, okay. 

00:24:05
Too many professionals hold the misconception that hypnosis is the therapy ("hypnotherapy") and thereby miss the salient points: Whatever therapy approach you use, what is the most influential language to use? And what is the quality of absorption the client will need to 

00:24:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO So the, the idea that hypnosis is somehow a therapy misses the point that any therapist and every therapist is going to be using suggestions inevitably. Now that sounds obvious I think but I'll tell you when I was researching my book, Mindfulness and Hypnosis wanting to draw people's attention to the overlaps between hypnosis and mindfulness the suggestive procedures the use of languages, the quality of meditative experience, the goal orientation that clients have despite clinician saying that's attention without intention. In actuality you're doing it because there is an intention. You're clients wants to feel better and you're saying to them, "Here's a mindfulness meditation. It will help you feel better." It is purposeful despite the fact that people sometimes portray it as not but I interviewed virtually all of the experts for my book, the names you know and I was shocked that how many of the said, "Oh, why don't use suggestion in my work." And I'm like, "Are you kidding me?" Are you really that self-deceptive to think that you've got this pure spiritual practice that transcends language. What happens when you say to people, "Close your eyes." What happens when you say to people, "Focus on the breath." When your mind wanders come back to the breath. Did those sound like suggestions to you? Extraordinary, of course, they're highly suggestive, highly directive and to think that you can just awakened the Buddha within that, that somehow you're not part of the process of what you illicit is more self-deception. Now, that's not to take anything away from the clinical and spiritual merits of mindfulness but I'm really talking now about the language that we use as we introduce these things to people and to study suggestion to understand the different qualities of suggestions, the different structures of suggestions, the different ways of appliance suggestions, the many different ways of saying the same thing. You said it like this, they didn't get it. What if you say it like this, they still don't get it. What if you say it a different way like this and they still don't get it and then you say the different way and this time they'll go, got it. So that is an important part of understanding what it's all about. 

00:27:00
Some of the Many Key Domains of Hypnotic Inquiry • Neuroscience, neural mechanisms, and morphological differences across individuals 

00:27:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO From the other dimensions of study, the things that we have been learning along the way, so many great scientific studies the neuroscience trying to understand the neural mechanisms of these processes really. Why I can mumble a few words to somebody and their body goes numb and now they can have their body cut open surgically? All right, I'm "inexpert" on hypnosis. I wrote the leading the text in the field since fourth edition. If you ask me as the expert, "How does that happen?" My deeply insightful answer is, "Hell if I know." I don't know and I don't know anybody who does know but that's what's attracted now in the last decade, a whole new generation of neuroscientist who are asking that and many others similar questions. What's going on in the brains of people who are able to go through surgical procedures without a chemical anesthetic? What's going on in the brains of people who are able to relieve these experiences in what's called an age regression where the experience is generating the same neurological signatures as when the person actually had the experience. Now that's-- that whole exploration of how hypnosis affects memory and the morphological difference is refers to either differences in brain structures between people who are more responsive compared to people who are less responsive. 

00:29:00
• Hypnotic responsiveness (hypnotizability) as a general phenomenon 

00:29:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO So looking at that phenomenon of hypnotic responsiveness just as an example. It certainly one of the things that we've come to appreciate, you know this from your own direct clinical experience and especially if you do experiential things like mindfulness then you really know what I'm talking about. How is it that you do a hypnosis session with someone or a mindfulness guided meditation with someone or an imagery, or visualization or some experiential process and 20 minutes later, this person sits up and opens their eyes and goes, "Wow! That was amazing!" And other people sit up and open their eyes and go, "So?" You have this wide spectrum of responses. Now let me do something hookey with you just to show you what I'm talking about. This is actually an test item from the most widely used hypnotizability scale on the planet. It's called the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale. It was developed at Stanford University, the famed Stanford Hypnosis Research Lab that was run for decades. Well, it was the, the place to study hypnosis, Ernest Hilgard and André Weitzenhoffer. They developed the test. Its got 12 items on it. This is one of them. If you can do it stand up where you are please so we can do this quick exercise just to make the point that I'm making cuz it opens up the curious question. Now, if you would extend your arms out in front of you without hitting the person in front of you unless you really want to. Close your eyes for a moment and take in a deep breath continuing to have your arms out, extended in front of you palms up. Now consider this if you will and exercise an imagination. I want you to imagine that I'm gonna come around to each person in the room including you and I'm going to place in the palm of your right hand a very heavy rock and I'm going to tie to the wrist of your left hand a very large helium balloon. Now, what I would like you to focus on is now imagine I'm placing the rock in your right hand literally focus on the imagery, the feelings, the sensations of having this heavy rock in your right hand. Feel the greedy texture of the rock and you'll notice how the rock because it's heavy starts to weigh you down it brings. It's very hard to hold it up at the same level and now if you'd imagine I'm tying to your left wrist this huge helium balloon. A balloon so large, so light. It would literally lift you off the face of the earth if it wasn't for this rock holding you down. And so, the rock holding you down on the right side the balloon lifting you higher. On the left side, lifting weightlessly in your left side and a very, very heavy on the right side. Heavier and heavier still, lighter and lighter still. Now, pause, open your eyes look around the room. Don't move your arms. Look around the room and get a sense of the distribution of responses. Some people literally like this, more people like this, some people still like this going, "What the hell?" Go ahead and sit back down. Now, that-- I framed it as just an exercise in imagination. I didn't do a hypnotic induction with you. I didn't get you absorb in the depth of your capacity for different experiences but even with that instruction, imagine the response you discover how there are some people with great imaginative ability and it translates into actual physical responses. Now, how is that happen? How is it that somebody can actually feel the greediness of the rock, the lightness of the balloon? And how is it that other people have no idea in the range of responses? Now, if you didn't respond much to that so what? That's part of the discovery in this whole thing. The fact that people differ in their quality of hypnotic responsiveness, that's are given. You know, the field of hypnosis is internally divided. There are many different view points, many different perspectives about this ambiguous phenomenon called hypnosis. Even people who are hypnosis experts who don't believe there such a thing as hypnosis all the way that people give it a very tight, well-defined, structured kind of definition and description and the fact that the field is internally divided the same way to psychotherapy field is how many different models of psychotherapy are there, four or 500. So there, there are divisions and you'd expect those divisions of different viewpoints about it. So there are a lot of things in the field of hypnosis that people are entirely unanimous on but one of the things that they are entirely unanimous on is the recognition that people differed in their quality of responsiveness. Now, what that opens up then is the question of why. What is different about the different people that lead one person to be more responsive or one person to be less responsive? That has direct clinical relevance to you. Don't you wanna know why some people are more responsive to your treatments and why some people are responsive to your treatment? They has immediate relevance and so there is a huge body of literature addressing the question of what gives rise to hypnotic responsiveness? Now if somebody says, "Well, I don't think I can be hypnotize." You're not flattering yourself if you say that because part of what we do know is that there is a correlation with people being more imaginative, people being less reality bound, for the people who are the most concrete and the most-- unless they can see it here, feel it, touch it, taste it right now, they are the ones that have the hardest time with hypnosis or mindfulness for that matter same principles, you know, all the things that I say about hypnosis apply across the board to this other things. That, you know, for, for somebody who's tries to do mindfulness and their mind keeps running to what they have to do today that quality of reality orientation of having to be connected to the immediacy of what's going on, works against having this broader, more transcendent kinds of experiences in whatever modality your working but when you look at all the studies that have been done this hypnotic responsiveness tied to age? No. Gender? No. Education level? No. Socioeconomic status? No. Personality the big five? No. So what gives rise to it? There are so many different factors involved but there are the same factors that operate in psychotherapy in general. Hypnosis is a microcosm, a concentrated version of what's gonna go on in therapy anway and those factors fall in three domain. The personal factors that includes things like the person's previous experience with this kinds of approaches. It includes the person's quality of expectations and as will talk about in the second hour when I start to focus specifically on expectancy. Expectations are the strongest predictor, strongest influence on clinical outcome. That's true by the way for anti-depressant medications perhaps surprisingly but it-- its true of psychotherapy. The single greatest factor that determines clinical outcome is the quality of the client's expectations. Now, if I have a room full of therapist and I say, "Do you think it's important for the client to have positive expectations for treatment?" Everyone unanimously says, "Yes." And then, if I ask, "Okay, so what do you do to build positive expectancy?" That's when most therapist go. 

00:38:35
[sil.] 

00:38:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO It's such a critical factor and people don't really pay much attention to it but this is what I mean by the process side of the equation. Can I use hypnosis or, or parallel processes to absorb the person and the idea that things can change? And if you summarize the essence of negative expectations, the person says, "Why should I go to therapy talking to someone's never gonna help me? Why should I do the homework assignment? It's never gonna help the quality of negative expectancy? So there's a good reason why I'm gonna focus on the expectation issue a little bit later on. 

00:39:25
Some of the Many Key Domains of Hypnotic Inquiry • Neuroscience, neural mechanisms, and morphological differences across individuals • Hypnotic responsiveness (hypnotizability) as a general phenomenon • Differences in hypnotizability across individuals and groups, including the social and cognitive factors that underlie responsiveness 

00:39:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Looking at differences in hypnotizability across individuals and groups highlighting that there are lots of social factors and cognitive factors that mediate responsiveness. When you look at the modern neural science, you know, the, the word trance has disappeared from the language. What modern scientist focus on is a quality of people's attention and the fact that there are different qualities of attention, different attentional subsystems in the brain. So the reason that trance has largely disappeared from the more scientific literature is all those slew of studies of asking people about their experience and people didn't feel like they were "in a trance" they were aware, they knew what was happening, they were proactively participating in the process and I think that surprises people who have the older misconceptions. If you do hypnosis with somebody for surgery let say and there's the patient is on the operating table, the surgeon has made the incision, there's the incision, it's all right there and you ask the person, "How are you doing?" The patient says, "Fine." "Any difficulty?" "No." "Are you comfortable?" "Yes." You're talking to them. They just happen to be having surgery at the moment. Its mind-blowing. Forty years later, it still blows my mind because I don't get it. I know how to use it but I can't say I or anybody else understands the physiopathways that make these kinds of experiences not only possible but available to people and to me that's why if I emperor of the therapy universe, it's be-- it would be first skills that you would learn. You'd first learn the skills of hypnosis to know how it introduce ideas to people, when to introduce ideas to people, how to suggest possibilities for shifts in all kinds of ways that make a difference. 

00:41:55
Hypnosis Provides Vital Insights Regarding: • Brain functions • Information processing • Mind-body relationships; epigenetics • Expectancy and treatment response • Components of clinical effectiveness • Relationship (therapeutic alliance) dynamics 

00:41:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Let me-- look at this we're talking about the brain functions, information processing, the mind-body relationships, epigenetics, study that just came out of Harvard that show that even one people they, they did DNA microassays before hypnosis training, relaxation training and then DNA microassays afterwards 1500 genes change expression. I mean, that's what epigenetic does as it changes genetic expression, ah, so the, the fact that it's demonstrable biologically okay, that's great but that's not what you and I were doing in and we're not doing it to change the quality of the person's gene expression. This was the consequence. We're doing it so that the person feels empowered. Can you imagine for even a moment, what it's like for somebody to learn to self-hypnosis to the degree where they regulate pain in their body and go have some medical procedure done even if it's a small one, even if it's just getting your arm stitched up or something and the person does it without any anesthetic, this person comes bouncing out of the clinic or the hospital like rocky and while the most misconception is that hypnosis is somehow gonna disempower people nothing could be further from the truth, what holds me here is the ability to empower people to do things they didn't know they could do. Can you imagine what it's like for somebody to discover that they can regulate sensation in their body when they've been suffering and now they're not? They've their medications in half where they've eliminated it all together. It's extraordinary and instead of it seeming cosmic and mysterious as if its somehow beyond you. What I'm hoping comes across is, is a simple extension of what you're already doing. You're already focusing people, you're already talking to people and introducing ideas to them but now to be able to do that at a far more experiential levels what we're really talking about expectancy and treatment response, components of clinical effectiveness, relationship dynamics. These are all the things that hypnosis has been studying from the very beginning and once you get all the ritualistic stuff out of the way, I mean, this what we've come to know, you don't need a rituals for hypnosis. You don't need the swinging watch and you don't need to say to people, "10 relax, nine deeper, deeper, deeper, eight, relax, relax, relax, seven, going deeper and deeper and deeper, six, five, four, three, two, one," you know, that-- that's what I mean by a ritual. Counting numbers at somebody, how relaxing is that exactly? Especially if they have a math phobia, you know, it's just-- there-- there are all kinds of ways of engaging someone's attention. You don't need the rituals, you do need the suggestions and that what's been so interesting. There's, ah, there's a one specific model of hypnosis, there are many, as you've been walking around here most principally you've been exposed to the Ericksonian approach, no surprise, it's the Erickson Foundation sponsoring the meaning and the Ericksonian approach is one that I'm philosophically and pragmatically allied with but there are also other models that are very instructive and of-- one of those principal models is known as the social cognitive perspective of hypnosis. The social cognitive perspective focuses on the social factors what is it about defining this as a hypnotic experience as well as the cognitive factors, the quality of the person's thinking. How different it is to do hypnosis with somebody who is a concrete thinker versus an abstract thinker? How different it is do hypnosis with somebody who is brain is lightning fast and somebody else where I thought wave hits them roughly every two minutes? Everybody is different and that's part of the study of hypnosis is how do you adjust your approach to the nature of the person that you're working with, that's what take so much time to learn. If I was just gonna teach somebody to read a hypnosis script as long as you can read that-- that I'll take about five minutes to teach you that but if or you really wanna do is engaged with people in very personal ways that make it very absorbing for them, now it's a considerably more involve training process but not ridiculously, you know, to be able to spend some days learning how to do these things to help people in pain. It is extraordinarily lifesaving. 

00:47:05
During Hypnosis, People Can Experience Marked Shifts in: • Physiology (breathing slows, muscles relax, etc.) 

00:47:10
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, when we look at it more specifically, the kinds of things that were trying to introduce to people the shifts in their experience. Certainly the shifts in physiology, the people become aware of, typically people's breathing slows down, they feel like their muscles relaxing, uhm, pulse rate goes down, blood pressure goes down. So if all you wanted to do was a physical relaxation process, great. Given a number of stress-related disorders and anxiety disorders even just doing relaxation helps but that is an exceedingly limited and superficial use of hypnosis. Now superficial to me isn't bad so there's nothing, ah, demeaning when someone says, "That's a superficial intervention." Sleep is for example, a critically important issue in people's lives especially in the world I live in, ah, treating depression. Sleep has diagnostic value. It has prognostic value helping people gets learn how to sleep better, has a positive impact that's measurable under depression but if you're gonna do relaxation to help people fall asleep more easily and stay asleep more easily. This is not a deep intervention but its an exceptionally important one. So doesn't have to be deep in order for it to be incredibly valuable. 

00:48:40
• Sensory perception (temp, weight, distance, etc.) 

00:48:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO So the sensory perceptions to be able to shift your sense of temperature in your body, or the weight of your body or the weight of part of your body, or the sense of distance from it, how detached you might feel from for example, that painful part of your body or increase sensory awareness, you know, for people who do sexual therapy, sex therapy to get people connected to their bodies so that they can have normal and healthy and satisfying sexual experiences, to be able to connect to your body so that you eat less, so that you're eating mindfully, to be able to connect to your body and all kinds of ways that are meant to be helpful to people. Probably don't need that they are right now. 

00:49:30
• Cognition (thoughts clearer, slower, detached, etc.) 

00:49:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO So these shifts in people's experience. They're used by you clinically for su-- the support of therapeutic outcomes. The, the use of hypnosis to introduce shifts in cognition. Now people trained in cognitive behavioral therapy learn about automatic thoughts. Cognitive therapy did not discover automatic thoughts. Fifty years earlier in the hypnosis literature, you'll find volumes about what is called ideocognition. That's what automatic thoughts were called before. They were called automatic thoughts. Now, I don't know if you have ever had the chance to see this but if you to YouTube and you type in the search engine Aaron Beck, Michael Yapko a discussion will come up that one of the things that I, I, ah, got into a discussion with him about because Dr. Beck has no training in hypnosis or didn't at that time. He didn't really know how I was blending hypnosis with CBT for working with depressed people and when I started talking about one of the most curious things about hypnosis is this capacity for automaticity, what called automaticity. The fact that people can have this responses that arise involuntarily or non-volitionally. So the idea of instead of identifying automatic thoughts and correcting distorted automatic thoughts, I talked with him about the use of hypnosis to instill positive automatic thoughts and when we-- when we're talking about this, you can practically see his both eyes twirling. Still the only guy who know who can look cool on a bow tie as, as you'll see later this morning. So, you know, the, the, the fact is I'm describing now how hypnosis can be integrated with cognitive and behavioral approaches. 

00:51:50
• Affect (happier, sadder, curious, etc.) 

00:51:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO So to be-- the-- but that's-- it's this notion of automaticity to do what's called the induction of affect. The ability to use hypnosis has a vehicle for introducing and shifting emotional states. So mindfulness does this beautifully. If you're gonna do a mindfulness session about compassion you're doing from a hypnotic perspective the induction of affect. Can I help this person develop the feelings of being more compassionate or the feelings of being more empathetic or the feelings of being curious? So often when I'm working with people who suffer anxiety a lot of what I'm doing is induction of affect of how can I move you away from fear and engage you with a sense of curiosity? So that you're more afraid it and more curious about it than you are afraid of it. So really interesting quality of intervention and how quickly it happens that in the span of 20 minutes, this person went from terrified to wondering about it. And when I say 20 minutes, I'm not exaggerated and instead enduring quality see I, I should make the statement to make it vulnerably clear. Hypnosis cures nothing. Hypnosis cures nothing. It isn't doing hypnosis with somebody that's therapeutic, it's what happens during the hypnosis, the new understandings, the new things that click for this person and for those of you that worth the demonstration you heard her described during and afterwards, hears this whole different perspective that evolved during the course of a half-hour session or however long that was and that is what so interesting but you, you see that same thing in mindfulness when people go through this compassion meditation and they come out, sit up, open their eyes and hears this blissful look on your face as they reach a level of compassion for themselves that replaces all that nasty self-criticism and compassion for other people that translates into and embracing utmost the tolerance at least for other people and their differences. But I'm interested in the process part of it. How can I suggest compassion or how can I suggest curiosity and it becomes reflexive for the person? That's what I mean by a non-volitional response. So the, the induction of affect, the shift in behaviors. Can I send you out with some new behavior to do? 

00:54:55
• Behavior (self-help, new behavior, proactive, etc.) 

00:55:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Now, you know, for people who have gone through my, my $100 training they know that I'm a big fan of homework assignments. Most therapist say, "Yay! I used homework assignments." But one of the best ways we actually get people to do them, giving them as one thing, getting people they actually do them is another and of the artistries of introducing assignments is when in hypnosis, you do a process called seeding. Seeding where you orient the person to some behavior, some experiment you're gonna ask this person to do later after the session is over and you're encouraging this person to engage in some new behavior. You wanna feel better, do something different. You wanna be able to solve a problem, do something different. What you do is every bit as important as what you feel. 

00:56:00
• Temporal orientation (past, present, future focus) 

00:56:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO And of course, the ability to work in the realm of temporal orientation, you know, the quality of people's problems, all problems have embedded within them are temporal element. So here's another way of describing hypnosis training when you study hypnosis you're learning about how people structure their experiences which is a very different question than why. Why is the person having the problem? You can speculate endlessly. How the person is having the problem is clearly identifiable. First they do this, then they do this, then they do this, then they do this and then they have the panic attack or whatever the problem behavior is. Every problem has embedded within it as you start looking at structural components of people's problems and by now you're getting the idea, this is a theoretical. I'm not interested in or promoting anyone's specific theory. All the different theories are great. There, there good metaphors. Hypnosis is big on use of metaphor, use of stories sometimes of course, people forget that a theories are metaphors. They forget that there is no inner child unless you're pregnant. It's a metaphor. It's a way of thinking about things but it isn't reality but the, the idea that you can look at these different theories and be enlightened by them is great but at the level beneath that I'm more interested as a clinician of what to say and what to do here, how can I interrupt this sequence by which this person generates the symptoms? The symptom patterns. So every symptom is made up of many different components. There's a cognitive component and emotional component or behavioral component or relational component or contextual component and one of the components is a temporal component. 

00:58:20
During Hypnosis, People Can Experience Marked Shifts in: • Physiology (breathing slows, muscles relax, etc.) • Sensory perception (temp, weight, distance, etc.) • Cognition (thoughts clearer, slower, detached, etc.) • Affect (happier, sadder, curious, etc.) • Behavior (self-help, new behavior, proactive, etc.) • Temporal orientation (past, present, future focus) 

00:58:20
MICHAEL D. YAPKO So that you can easily see how if somebody suffers anxiety disorders. Is that a disorder that's geared more towards past, present or future? Say it. The future. This person doesn't have an airplane phobia because they were in a fatal plane crash. They're having flashbacks. They're having flash-forwards to what could go wrong. How are you gonna shift that view of the future? Somebody who has an impulse disorder, past, present or future? By definition, present. Right now, they want that substance. Right now, they want that whatever it is right now. You take something like depression, past oriented. People come in and they tell you, you know, every disappointment, every rejection, every humiliation and then they use the past as the reference point even for predicting the future. So they say things like,"I'll never be happy." Why not? Because I never have been. Past predicting the future. So the use hypnosis as a vehicle for orienting the person to a dimension of time, you know, from a psychotherapeutic point of view, the most commonly applied hypnotic phenomenon, I said in behavioral medicine anesthesia was the most commonly applied phenomenon. In the world of psychotherapy the most commonly applied phenomenon is age regression. Age regression is defined as the intense utilization of memory. The experiential utilization of memory and the person can get into a memory from a more detached perspective if that's what you want to do, what's called an observer memory or the person can literally step into the memory and be in it as if it's going on right now, what's called the field memory. And can you predict which is gonna have a greater emotional wallop? The field memory. Now, that's interesting because part of again, what you have to decide strategically and what I'm always emphasizing is the strategic applications of hypnosis and by that I mean, very clear what the outcome is that you're going after and to be able to delineate the steps for being able to get there. So there will be some times that you have people wrapped up very intensely in this memory or you wanna help them step out of it and then there's other times when people really haven't connected to thought about process or you want them to step into it and, and guide them through that process and from my perspective that is the clinicians responsibility to have sense of where this session is going. Now, I talked about this in my last workshops, some of you were there that, you know, again therapist philosophy, your own personal view of things and how much that impacts your clients. So that if I'm gonna, you know, hypnosis is an unapologetically goal-oriented process, you're doing hypnosis for a reason. There's a connection I'm trying to help this person make not only quickly but powerfully that there, there not gonna make just through discussion but when a therapist say to me, "Well, you know, Michael, I really like your work a lot but you're so goal-oriented." And then, here comes the lecture. Don't you know, it isn't about the destination, it's about the journey. Only therapist say that. Clients never say that. Clients don't come in for treatment and go, ah, "I'd like to go on a journey." And of course, it's not that these are even mutually exclusive. You can have the journey but you also wanna help people reach destinations along the way to be able to help them with there depression, anxiety, pain or whatever it is and empower them to live better, make better choices, have greater access to their own personal resources. Now, I can go talk, go-- I'm talking about that endlessly. I'd like to start talking about hypnosis and I'd like to do some. So with your permission, I would like to invite you to arrange yourself in a positions that's comfortable. If you're happy sitting where you're sitting, great. If you preferred to lie down or lean up against the wall or whatever you wanna do that, you know, helps you, ah, get comfortable, uhm, I'm all for it. Good time also to check that your cellphones are off. Now, I have spoken to the issue of expectancy and I was certainly say more about that but that's just to give a general indicator before we begin, that's what this session is gonna be about. I'm gonna speak to the topic of expectancy. So ones you have arrange yourself in a position that's comfortable, you can take in a few deep relaxing breaths and orient yourself now to internal experience for a little while. Now when I say, orient yourself to internal experience, that's a gradual evolution. You don't really just jumped in to deeply absorb experience instantly but certainly you have enough self-awareness to know what the experience of comfort is like. You certainly had lots of experiences of getting yourself focused and absorbed. And so is little by little, that your awareness can grow for the different qualities of your internal experience. It starts out of course in the more obvious ways of breathing, slowing down, body growing more comfortable and then, as your thoughts also slow down and become more focused, you just makes it that much easier to enjoy that process of self-discovery and in a way it's how I think about each experience of hypnosis, of focusing. It is creating an internal atmosphere that's gentle and kind because it gives you the opportunity to notice, to notice where your thoughts go when they don't have to go anywhere. And you get to discover whether your thoughts go the same routine mundane things or whether you use the space to start to notice something different about yourself and what I like about it is the more internally absorbed you get, the less it matters who's around or what's going on out there. It's really about your time with you and to orient you to hold the kinds of shifts that are possible. I really like the idea and the reality of knowing that these changes are inevitable all levels. There are lots of times that I like to get lost in thought just imagining. Sometimes I think I'm predicting but imagining what are the things that 20 years from now will be different in the world around us? What will change in medicine for example, things that are puzzling to us now that will have the answers to just as we have answers know to things that 10 years ago we didn't know what to do about. Or 15 years from now what kinds of forms of transportation people might be using that don't even exist today. How will social structure change over time? Who could have predicted the impact of Facebook or tweeting 10 years ago? It's such an enjoyable thing sometimes to think about things that have happened that could have never been predicted when Henry Ford invented the automobile could he have pro-- possibly predicted that there will be millions of miles of pave roads all over the world? Hundred years ago, who would have predicted landing a human on the moon and bringing him back again? But the same as true for you as an individual. Think about the things that you're capable of now. That you had no idea, you would be capable of ways that you've surprise yourself in the best of ways by evolving skills and awareness' that have made your life so much richer 

01:12:15
[sil.] 

01:12:20
MICHAEL D. YAPKO And if you were to consider just one or two of the things that are already a part of who you are that 20 years ago you would have never predicted and that's a wonderful thing but I'm interested in the process. How did you get from there and then to here and now? All the times that you didn't think you could and then you did and has it change your view of yourself when you take the time to consider. Sometimes I think people forget. They know how easy it is to forget that where they are in a given time in their life, isn't where they're going to be? Where you are right now isn't, where you're going to be necessarily in 10 years or 15 years or 20 years? 

01:14:20
An Example of Automaticity Glove anesthesia and blood flow control 

01:14:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO The things that even right now seem reflexing and troublesome that deep down you can know you'll move through to come out the other side a little wiser, a little more self-aware, perhaps a lot more self-aware. And so when you consider, all that is in front of you of the next few days, weeks, months and years. I'd love to know 10 years from now just how you surprise yourself in the past decade. The things that seemed so important to you that became unimportant and were easy to let go. And that process of letting go, it's really worth thinking about because as you know and I know every step forward means leaving something behind, every step forward means leaving something behind all the thing that you've outgrown whether it was childhood toys or people that mattered once that just don't matter much anymore or causes that mattered a lot at one time that have been replaced by new things that you care about more. And here we are at the evolution of psychotherapy but I'm really talking about the evolution of you. 

01:17:30
[sil.] 

01:17:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO I'm going to be silent for 30 seconds and you can use those 30 seconds to deepen you absorption and to enjoy that sense of optimism, that pervasive sense of optimism that goes along with realizing, your evolving at this very moment and when I again speak to you in 30 seconds my voice can just deepen your comfort, deepen your relaxation and the 30 seconds of silence begin now. 

01:18:30
[sil.] 

01:19:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO And you can just continue relax, continue to be at ease and resting comfortably. Now later this morning, we all have the opportunity to see and hear two of the finest people this field has produced representing simultaneously the history and the future of our field and you're gonna see the evolution of psychotherapy logo all over the place and when you see it I wouldn't be surprised if you heard yourself reading it as the evolution of me looking forward, looking forward. We can start to bring this experience now to a comfortable close, start the process of integrating and absorbing all the deeper implications of the things that I've talked about and then when you feel like you're ready too you can start the process of reorienting yourself gradually, reconnecting to your body, reconnecting to this environment, letting your eyes open, reorienting yourself completely, fully alert, relaxed, comfortable, optimistic, alert. Take a moment. Enjoy. Let it settle. Feel good? It's nice, isn't it? Yeah. Thanks. Thank you. You did. I was just chattering away, different possibilities. So I'm looking at the time and realizing there's a million things I'd love to talk about. I promise you I'd show you one quick clip that would, ah, give you an indication of what so remarkable. This happens to be a, ah, friend and colleague of mine doing a demonstration of what's glove anesthesia. The induces a sense of numbness, you know, woman's hand and inserts a needle into her hand and then when he is going to pull the needle out tells her, well, when I pull the needle out, it could-- there could be no blood at all or could bleed on both puncture points or could bleed on this one puncture point or it could bleed on that one puncture point and he's laying out the options for her, watch what happens. 

01:22:35
[sil.] 

01:22:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO This is-- I'll levitate. Pop it up way up. 

01:22:40
UNKNOWN Just let me know by raising the finger again and we'll test it together and what I'm going to do now I was just take an alcohol sponge and wipe away any remaining feeling that Maria might have in this hand allowing it to be free of any unnecessary feeling and then I'm just going to take sterile needle show Maria what she can accomplish with her subconscious mind. Just passing it through the skin. 

01:23:05
UNKNOWN Uhm, she didn' t feel any pain. 

01:23:05
UNKNOWN No. 

01:23:10
UNKNOWN I didn't see one reaction. 

01:23:10
UNKNOWN Not at all. Now Maria is a very subject and indeed if we allow this to be the S finger and this the no finger. Maria are having any discomfort at the present time. That's fine. 

01:23:20
UNKNOWN Signals no. 

01:23:20
UNKNOWN That's right. Maria is having no discomfort whatsoever. 

01:23:25
UNKNOWN It's amazing. 

01:23:25
UNKNOWN It is rather amazing what the unconscious mind can accomplished. Now, one of the interesting things that one can do at this point is that when one removes the needs there are four possible eventualities, four things can occur. One of the possible things is that there could be a tiny drop of blood at this side at the puncture wound in which event that Maria can decide which she'll choose and will allow this finger to be the signal for that to occur. There could be a tiny drop of blood on the other side and we can allow this finger to indicate that choice or there could be two tiny drops of blood one on either puncture wound in which event, I'll ask Maria to move this finger or they're could be no bleeding whatsoever in which even I'll ask her to move in. And Maria which of this four possibilities would to choose to have happen? Right into that. You know, just a tiny drop of blood on one side. 

01:24:15
UNKNOWN All right. 

01:24:15
UNKNOWN On this side over here. 

01:24:15
UNKNOWN Uhm-mm. 

01:24:15
UNKNOWN All right Maria, when you're ready show me to remove the needle just let me know. Focus your attention on that and when you're ready for the needle to come out just let me know by raising that finger and we'll see what happens. Okay, there we are. 

01:24:30
UNKNOWN Needle went out. 

01:24:30
UNKNOWN Just a tiny drop of blood on the right hand side puncture wound. There we are. 

01:24:35
UNKNOWN And there it is. 

01:24:35
UNKNOWN That's right. 

01:24:35
UNKNOWN None on the other side, and she is done here, she didn't feel a thing. 

01:24:40
UNKNOWN Not at all. 

01:24:45
[sil.] 

01:24:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO "So Maria I'm gonna pull the needle out, where are you gonna bleed?" She says, "Over here." Now if you had here and you ask her directly, "Maria, how did you do that?" Predictably she will say, "That's what keeps me up at night." But isn't it curious to you that she has the ability to demonstrate that level of physiological control under a very specific condition in response to a very specific suggestion and this response is entirely appropriate she chose it and it still and a non-volitional response. She can't make that happen consciously and deliberately and it's now as you enter the world of neuroscience using let-- there's a huge body of literature of what is called priming. The use of words and symbols to stimulate unconscious processes and then studying the, the, ah, relationship between this unconscious influences and very deliberate and purposeful responses. It's an extraordinary body of literature but when you study hypnosis which I hope you will, ah, I'm doing trainings the next one doing as in Chicago in May would love to have people there for that to really learn the skills of what it takes to be able to produce this kinds of responses with people is extraordinary. 

01:26:40
It is the future, not the past, that determines the present; the prophecy of the event leads to the even of the prophecy Paul Watzlawick 

01:26:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO So there is obviously so much more to say about this but this was meant to be really a, ah, a reminder about the possibilities. Paul Watzlawick was a huge hypnosis aficionado one of the architects strategic therapy of course, he said it's so beautifully, "it's the future, not the past, that determines the present; the prophecy of the event leads to the event of the prophecy another way of thinking about hypnosis." How can you instill a self-fulfilling prophecy so if the person will align their behavior and bring it about without it being so, so effortful, so difficult for the person. 

01:27:25
A Simplified Generic Structure for Building Expectancy • Induction • Response set regarding possibilities • Theme: The past doesn't necessarily predict the future • Theme: Take sensible action now with tomorrow in mind • Theme: Try and try again, but vary approaches • Post-hypnotic suggestion: Integrating optimism • Closure and disengagement Why Learn Hypnosis? • Empirical evidence it works, i.e., hypnosis objectively enhances treatment outcomes • All therapy involves the use of suggestion • Provides insights into subjective experience • Highlights the malleability of experience • Enhances one's sense of personal control • Multi-dimensional applications • Enhances cognitive, behavioral and emotional 

01:27:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, all of the things that I'd hope to be able to say in any event, you know, give me the reasons why it's worth learning. Evidence say it work lots of empirical literature, recognition of the use for suggestions, insights in the subjective experience, highlights the malleability of experience, increases a person sense of control. They didn't know they could do that and certainly the fact that we can use it in so many different ways, okay.

Trancework An Introduction to the Practice of Clinical Hypnosis FOURTH EDITION THANKS FOR COMING! Michael D. Yapko, Ph.D. michael@yapko.com www.yapko.com 

01:27:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO All right. Ah, Trancework is, is my book. We end it there. Thanks so much for coming. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank so much. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to be able to take questions so I've left 15 minutes now. I know some people always leaving the question and the answer parts so I'm-- you can do that but I really wanted to be able to or those on the back of the people as well? They should be. Uhm, if we can come to the microphones and I will be happy to address any particular questions you might have. 

01:28:40
UNKNOWN Thank you very much that was great. I enjoy it. 

01:28:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Great. Thank you.

Evolution of Psychotherapy Welcome! The 7th Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference The World's Largest Psychotherapy Conference Anaheim, California • 2013 

01:28:45
UNKNOWN So I have, ah, I have a circumstance it happens to me whenever I do participating something like this, it happen to me the other day during your presentation when I've watched, ah, DDDs of various people performing hypnotic inductions and demonstrating things. I, I get to the well, for example in this induction, the focusing internally and so forth and then, my mind was everywhere et cetera on, on what you were saying. 

01:29:15
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Uhm-mm. 

01:29:15
UNKNOWN Until you starting giving the suggestion to reorient back into the room. 

01:29:20
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Uhm-mm. 

01:29:20
UNKNOWN So I was awake but I was not here. 

01:29:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Uhm-mm. 

01:29:25
UNKNOWN Uhm, and that typically happens to me now when I work with patients I assumed and I think that's great that-- that's what's happening cuz I assumed unconsciously they're picking it up and they're running with it. 

01:29:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Maybe so. 

01:29:35
UNKNOWN But. 

01:29:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO But maybe not. 

01:29:40
UNKNOWN Maybe so but maybe not and I don't know what's happening with me and whether I can trust that I'm unconsciously picking up what I need to pick up and I'm wondering if you have any suggestions as to how I can maybe ensure that that's happening. 

01:29:50
THANKS FOR COMING! Michael D. Yapko, Ph.D. michael@yapko.com www.yapko.com 

01:29:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO I do. You know, first of all, the, the fact that somebody is mind wanders through the experience is hardly unusual. The person having surgery would say the exact same thing. By the way, you know, that, that their attention goes all different places that-- that's to be expected. You hope over time the person gets more focused but when people have competing internal distractions whatever those might be easiest thing in the world to do is open your eyes or you orient for 10 second, go right back and again and do that multiple times to somebody have to be eyes closed to do hypnosis, no. To somebody have to be relaxed to do hypnosis, no. You know, the, the thing that he finds hypnosis is not relaxation, you know, ah, in the, in the pre-conference on Tuesday I showed a video of hypnosis being done in what is called inactive alert mode. A woman paddling away furiously on a stationary bike, eyes open, looking ahead while the person doing the hypnosis in this case Hilgard is literally standing behind reading the script to her and still generating these various hypnotic responses. The thing that happens in a group that doesn't happen one on one. When I'm working with somebody one on one I have the opportunity to check in with you to find out what's going on. What's easier for you to engaged with? What's tougher for you to engaged with? When do you spin off into something else and when do you reeve it right back to what's going on and to increase that over time but it's not the kind of thing I'm concerned about because again first thing I'm going to assess is when you come back next week for next week's session if you're my client I get to ask you, "Okay, did you notice anything different this week?" You say to me, "Well, you know, I have a lot of amnesia for last week's session but Wednesday night I was in the grocery store and I started thinking about this and when I start to thinking about then I also and I realize this and I mean word for word," they're telling what I said within hypnosis but they have source amnesia for it, that's the person where you can trust their unconscious. On the other hand, you come back a week later and I say, "Anything different?" And you say, "No." Okay, your unconscious I'm not gonna trust. So feedback is a everything and even shaping it during the experience very different work in one on one than it is working in groups where I don't have the ability to interact with people and keep it focused. Yes?

01:32:40
UNKNOWN Ah, I'm, I'm just maybe sort of a complex area to address but we know that when working with trauma, interoception going within tends to cause flooding. 

01:32:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Uhm-mm. 

01:32:50
UNKNOWN It looks like hypnosis directs us into proprioception internally but... 

01:32:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO De-- depending how you structure it. 

01:33:00
UNKNOWN Can you say... 

01:33:00
THANKS FOR COMING! Michael D. Yapko, Ph.D. michael@yapko.com www.yapko.com 

01:33:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Can I use hypnosis to orient someone externally? If what I want to do is encourage you to be more observant in social interaction so that you don't say silly stuff to people my hypnosis session for example would be to orient you externally but even take the thing about flooding. Tuesday I showed a video of a guy with a history of massive amounts of physical abuse, violence at the hand of his father. That's what he does as he floods. I use the hypnosis to focus him internally but on a very specific skill namely the skill of compartmentalization. How do you help people who are flooding? They have to learn compartmentalization skills but again here-- here's the difference if you're not experienced with these things people who say, "Okay, I'd like to do hypnosis." They do it with somebody that has a history of trauma they say, "Okay. Sit back. Close your eyes." And where does the person go instantly? Right to the trauma and then the therapist says, "Wooh! I'm not gonna do that anymore." Wrong, that's the person who most needs it because they have such a rigid response of as soon as they close their eyes they go to the trauma. I want them to be able to close their eyes and go inside and find some good things in there. Okay, yes ma'am.

01:34:25
UNKNOWN I was just wondering be-- because so many clients have sleep problems what you said about helping to encourage... 

01:34:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yeah. 

01:34:35
UNKNOWN Deeper sleep. Could you just say a little more about, you know, specific suggestions you know, in the time we have quickly the-- can you help us with that one? 

01:34:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yeah, yes. You know, if you look at the, ah, sleep disturbance insomia been the most common symptom associated with both depression and anxiety. So you run into it all the time. A lot of therapist never ask their clients about the quality of sleep but let me, let me illustrate the point to you for a second. Is there anybody in here who is a very good sleeper. Okay. A man. You're a very good sleeper? What's your name? Alex? Okay. When you go to sleep, what do you think about? There it is. There it is. She's your role model. Now let me think about anything, she'll know. Now if you ask people who are suffering a sleep disturbance, when you go to sleep what do you thinking about, they don't say nothing they say? 

01:35:50
UNKNOWN Everything. 

01:35:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Everything. So when you study people who are good sleepers one of the patterns that they have is they have the ability to detached from the events of the day, detached from the events of tomorrow they're not processing all these things and the problems and contemplating then analyzing, they're not ruminating. Now, in the literature this is what's called cognitive arousal and it's a well-known pattern of people with insomnia. They are thinking about their problems, it stimulates all kinds of stress hormone productions, elevated levels of cortisol and epinephrine and it's a problem so we want to encourage both physiological relaxation but also cognitive relaxation. So I want your sleep disturbed client to learn to do what she does. I want them to think about nothing, that they are number of things to do to help in that from the hypnosis side of the equation to be able to introduce keeping the focus on the immediacy of experience. Here's were being in the now is a really good strategy so that you're only focus on the immediacy of how your beds feels beneath you or how your pillow feels under your head the routine sounds of the environment and in the same way in mindfulness you would say, come back to the breath, come back to the breath, come back to the breath that kind of an approach but come back to all the sensory experiences of being comfortable in bed. Now for some people it helps them to have an external source for that. So you know, it-- it's why I-- I've made sleep CD's where people can use to help themselves fall asleep, focus on me and I'm the one who's telling you focus on the immediacy of experience, feel the calmness of your sheets and, ah, comfort of your pillow and all those kinds of things. But every person needs process in time and so to support that besides teaching the person to compartmentalize and focus on the immediacy of sleep, you're also want to make sure that the person has other times during the day to do the problem solving that they need to do so that they're not doing it at bedtime, you know, to simplify it bedtime is not the time to problem solve, bedtime is a time to just stay focus on the immediacy of the comfort of falling asleep. Okay, yes sir. 

01:38:30
THANKS FOR COMING! Michael D. Yapko, Ph.D. michael@yapko.com www.yapko.com 

01:38:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, in terms of the issue like keeps you up at night. 

01:38:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yeah. 

01:38:35
UNKNOWN You mentioned the, ah, like the girl how she was able to predict where she was gonna bleed from. When I read some of the, uhm, case histories of Milton Erickson, it seems that he had a clear idea or some sort of map as to how the conscious, unconscious mind in the body are all interacting and somehow he is able to intervene in the certain-- it's a very specific ways to create the affects you wanted even on a, on a, on a physical, uhm, developmental level. So I was wondering first of all, if, if you have the sense also that he really had to map he had to, he hadn't a, a clear workout map of how these things interrelated or was it just an intuitive sense that he had based on his own history in experience, that's the first question and the second one is, is there anyone that's researching this specific aspect of Erickson's work and trying to understand how he saw these connections during the conscious, unconscious in, in body? 

01:39:35
THANKS FOR COMING! Michael D. Yapko, Ph.D. michael@yapko.com www.yapko.com 

01:39:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yes and yes. Question one, yes he had maps. He has-- he had guidelines. He wasn't psychic, he wasn't intuitive. He had a clear cut sense and you know, in the same way if you think about where I started the workshop, somebody walks and sits down says, "I have trust issues." Now, does this person need to spell it out for you or do you know people think that's intuitive on my part, you know, people ask me after my demonstration that exact question of, "How did you know this about her and how did you know that about her?" You know, if you, if you understand the concept of sequencing of how did somebody get here, what are the steps of somebody would had to follow to get to this point. Somebody doesn't reach that issue of suspicion and trust without betrayal in their background. Now we're just getting to the details of who and when and why and under what conditions. So yes, there is absolutely a map and in terms of people studying Erickson, oh my, I mean, go to the Erickson foundation website and look at the huge volume of literature of everybody who's been analyzing Erickson's work for the last 40 years. And, ah, you know, different people have different view points of course, you know, Ro-- Rosley has so much more into psychic viewpoint, ah, linking has so much more cognitive viewpoint. Different people have different viewpoints about his work, you know, Jay Haley had a developmental framework. You know, Jay Haley's book Uncommon Therapy if you haven't read that was an extraordinary book and you know, Ja-- Jay was a mentor and friend to me for many, many years and, and not, not long before he passed away I said to him, "You know, I still read Uncommon Therapy once a year just to look at what therapeutic genius looks like." Jay said, "You know, I think everybody should read Uncommon Therapy once a year and buy a new copy each time." But the point is, there are lots of very smart people that have analyze Erickson's work and taken it beyond what he himself could explain because he was a very prolific writer and very prolific teacher. There are lots of his lectures on tape. There are lots of his writings where he's explaining exactly what he was doing and why he was doing it. 

01:42:00
UNKNOWN Could I just a-- could I just answer the question a little bit. 

01:42:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Uhm. 

01:42:00
THANKS FOR COMING! Michael D. Yapko, Ph.D. michael@yapko.com www.yapko.com 

01:42:00
UNKNOWN There's, there's one particular story that, that intrigues me and every time I read it I can't figure out what the life of you know, what he was doing is a story of a girl I, I mentioned it from earlier that a girl who came to him that was diagnosed with schizophrenic and she also had issues with developing breaths and through the use of hypnosis and he's version of, of psychotherapy he was able to cure her of, of both those issues. So I was just wondering if there's anyone that elucidates exactly how he was able to tap into the-- I guess the hormonal responses in endocrine system through the use of hypnosis. 

01:42:35
THANKS FOR COMING! Michael D. Yapko, Ph.D. michael@yapko.com www.yapko.com 

01:42:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO The whole thing is what, what, what the Ericksonian hypnosis is founded on in Erickson's own words, the principle of utilization which is accept and utilize. Now what that means in practical terms is you introduce a possibility to someone, I introduce a possibility to you that you can control the bleeding in your hand. I can't guarantee it. Let's see what happens. I suggest the possibility now is there a way for you to mobilize that possibility into an actuality and there's where are the gap is in our knowledge. I don't know what happened in her that made that possible. Erickson would never be able to explain to you why this happened. All he did was create the conditions to make it possible, okay. One more. 

01:43:30
THANKS FOR COMING! Michael D. Yapko, Ph.D. michael@yapko.com www.yapko.com 

01:43:30
UNKNOWN Excuse me. 

01:43:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Wooh-oh. Where are the other hand? 

01:43:35
UNKNOWN I was first. 

01:43:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO I'm so glad you're assertive about it. I didn't even see you. 

01:43:40
UNKNOWN Okay. Uhm, I-- you might of just answer my question. I work with people with schizo affective disorder. 

01:43:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Ah-huh. 

01:43:45
UNKNOWN As well as schizophrenia. 

01:43:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Uhm. 

01:43:50
UNKNOWN And what is role of hypnotherapy if any? 

01:43:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Hypnotherapy. Let me ask the... 

01:43:55
UNKNOWN Oh, I'm sorry. 

01:43:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, let me ask the question. Forget hypnosis for a second. 

01:44:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:44:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO What would you wanna teach this person? 

01:44:05
UNKNOWN To love themselves and to be, uhm,... 

01:44:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO That's not gonna cure their schizo affective disorder. 

01:44:10
UNKNOWN I know. 

01:44:10
THANKS FOR COMING! Michael D. Yapko, Ph.D. michael@yapko.com www.yapko.com 

01:44:10
MICHAEL D. YAPKO You're gonna wanna teach them to be more reality-based? You're gonna wanna teach them a discrimination strategy for how to distinguish imagination from fact? You're gonna want to teach them social skills to be able to engage with other people? You're gonna wanna teach them to be more flexible in there interactions so there not imposing their viewpoints and turning people off? Now as soon as you start thinking in terms of what do I wanna teach to this person in the therapeutic context, here comes the role of hypnosis. How do I get you focused on externals to be able to see reality? How do I orient you to the idea that the things that you think aren't always necessarily true? So I, I can do a session with you here's what you're feeling is now, how can we test out whether that's really going on out there? Then send you out to do the homework assignment but using the hypnosis to build the base that you might discover things out there that turn out to contradict what's in here and not only can you tolerate that but you can use it as a basis for growth. 

01:45:15
UNKNOWN So it is possible to slow the line down? 

01:45:20
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Is there any person, any person you wouldn't wanna have a meaningful conversation with? 

01:45:25
UNKNOWN No. Okay. Thank you. 

01:45:25
THANKS FOR COMING! Michael D. Yapko, Ph.D. michael@yapko.com www.yapko.com 

01:45:30
UNKNOWN I love about question just proceeded mine and I that answer probably was my favorite part of this lecture beyond the experiential piece. I was just gonna ask you if you can please, uhm, say a bit about false memories and whether you've had such an experience what you do especially around trauma and alongside that whether you think that it may reflect some incompetence from the clinician... 

01:45:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Uhm-mm. 

01:45:55
UNKNOWN Or whether that's just something that you work around? 

01:46:00
THANKS FOR COMING! Michael D. Yapko, Ph.D. michael@yapko.com www.yapko.com 

01:46:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Are, are you asking me that because you know my history with the issue or do you not know? I wrote the first book on the subject that's called suggestions of abuse. It was front page New York Times, it exploded the false memory thing, it was everywhere. It was the first book on the subject and I'd paid the price for it in some ways because a lot of therapist had no idea that the very act of digging for this presumably refreshed memories could create them. And so, when we start to look at how, you know, when I said that age regression is the most commonly applied hypnotic phenomenon as soon as you get into the realm of memory, if you don't know how memory works, if you don't know that memory is highly suggestible, if you don't know that you can create memories for having suffered abuses that never actually happened and the person will swear to it and, and integrate it into their view of themselves as they "abuse survivor". So I was strongly encourage you to read the book Suggestions of Abuse, I could have written it yesterday. It's still that fresh and I'll tell you when it first came out I got slammed from both sides. The subtitle of the book is true and false memories of childhood sexual trauma. So the recovery people slammed to me for suggesting that the memories could be false, others slammed me for suggesting that the memories could be true and, ah, I just said, what is still true today? There is no objective way to distinguished a confabulation from authentic memory without external evidence. So a lot of what goes on in my trainings when we're talking about this is how to prevent false memories, how to work with people's memories without contaminating the memories, how to that skillfully because you absolutely can instill false memories in people. These was in the mid 90s. The, the issue that just ripped this field apart. People who became mortal enemies because of what happened during this. This whole episode and the problem was that so many of the people who were doing trauma work knew nothing about memory because in the 1960s and 1970s there were more than 300 police departments across the country that had full time hypnotize on stuff for the purpose of enhancing eye witness testimony. Hypnotizing people to get more details about crimes so the researchers appropriately got into the act to asked the question so does hypnosis do this? Does hypnosis increase the amount of accurate recall? And as it turns out hypnosis works in the worst of ways because it increases the amount of inaccurate recall and increases the person's level of certainty. So they are very wrong and very sure. So it's an, an issue that has to be handled very delicately and in that book Suggestions of Abuse I provided the first guidelines that anybody had provided cuz it was the first book on the subject. I tell the whole story of why it became such a big deal but soon after it came out the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association adopted everyone of the guidelines I provide still in place for how to deal with this memories realistically. So thanks you ask. 

01:50:00
UNKNOWN Thank you. I'm glad you were the, ah, you were the one to ask and I ask. 

01:50:00
