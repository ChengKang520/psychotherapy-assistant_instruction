Psychotropic Medications: 

00:00:05
Adverse Drug Reactions 

00:00:10
Medication Specific Disorders 

00:00:15
[music] 

00:00:20
SEAN HARRIGAN In our first program in this series on Adverse Drug Reactions, we looked at the generalize side effects for Psychotropic Medications used in the treatment of mental disorders. Many of the side effects mentioned were those that occurred across multiple classes of Psychotropic Medications. They were further categorized by their decrease severity or potential to be life threatening. In this program we will examine the adverse drug reactions specific to a certain medication class or even an individual medication within that class. Many of these adverse reactions also pose an increase danger to the patient. However, it is important to remember that all side effects should be treated with the same care and sensitivity as they can all present challenges to the patient seeking treatment for a medal disorder. Just as these medications can manifest themselves in a variety of ways depending on the patient, so too can each patient be affected differently by the presence of these symptoms in both their treatment and lives. 

00:01:25
ANTIPSYCHOTICS 

00:01:30
[music] 

00:01:35
SEAN HARRIGAN Antipsychotic agents fall under two broad categories. First generation agents called Typical Agents and second and third generation known Atypical Agents. 

00:01:50
Typical Agents 

00:01:55
[music] 

00:02:00
SEAN HARRIGAN The Atypical agents include such drugs as Haloperidol, Haldol. Thioridazine, Melleril. 

00:02:10
[music] 

00:02:15
SEAN HARRIGAN Thiothixene, Navane. Fluphenazine, Prolixin 

00:02:25
[music] 

00:02:30
SEAN HARRIGAN And Chlorpromazine, Thorazine. Significant side effects more common to typical agents include extrapyramidal side effects or movement disorders. However, because of the variety and expansiveness of the topic of movement disorders, we will be devoting the third program in this series to discussing their symptoms and treatment. 

00:02:55
ATYPICAL AGENTS 

00:03:00
[music] 

00:03:10
SEAN HARRIGAN The atypical agents include Aripiprazole, Abilify. Clozapine, Clozaril. 

00:03:20
[music] 

00:03:25
SEAN HARRIGAN Ziprasidone, Geodon. Risperidone, Risperdal. 

00:03:35
[music] 

00:03:40
SEAN HARRIGAN Quetiapine, Seroquel. And Olanzapine, Zyprexa. Atypical agents are known to increase the incidents of hyperglycemia and diabetes. If the individual is already diabetic, prior to beginning treatment, blood, sugar levels must routinely be monitored as glucose control can worsen. Patients at risk for diabetes need a fasting blood glucose test prior to beginning treatment and then in a minutely there after. Patients should be told to report signs of hyperglycemia including Polydipsia, Polyuria, Polyphagia and Weakness. While the typical agents have been known to cause the adverse drug reaction Agranulocytosis. It is most common with the Atypical agent Clozapine, Clozaril. Agranulocytosis is the loss of white cell production in the bone marrow. It is characterized by an extremely low white blood cell count suppressing the immune system. It can be fatal. Initial symptoms are that of common illnesses including soar throat, fever, and malaise. ACBC or complete blood count will assist in differentiating Agranulocytosis from other illnesses. Before beginning Clozapine a baseline white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count or ANC is obtained and then monitored weekly for the first six months of treatment. If the count remains within acceptable parameters after that time period, the physician may vary the frequency of testing. 

00:05:30
TYPICAL AND ATYPICAL AGENTS 

00:05:35
[music] 

00:05:45
SEAN HARRIGAN Both classes of anti-psychotics can cause changes in electrocardiogram readings, including prolongation of arrhythmias. These drugs are used with caution and patients who have a history of arrhythmias by screening ECGs before beginning the treatment and intermittently thereafter. Instruct patients to report symptoms of dizziness, palpitations, syncope, weakness, dyspnea, and peripheral edema. Studies have shown an increased risk of fatality among elderly patients receiving psychotropics for dementia-related psychosis, usually related to infection or cardiovascular problems. The FDA no longer approves these drugs for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis. 

00:06:35
[music] 

00:06:40
ANTIDEPRESSANTS 

00:06:45
[music] 

00:06:50
SEAN HARRIGAN There are four classifications of agents used for treating depression. Tricyclic antidepressants known as TCAs, MAOIs or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs and dual mechanisms antidepressants. 

00:07:10
TRICYCLICS 

00:07:15
[music] 

00:07:20
SEAN HARRIGAN Tricyclics include Clomipramine, Anafranil. 

00:07:25
[music] 

00:07:30
SEAN HARRIGAN Amitriptyline, Elavil. Desipramine, Norpramin. Imipramine, Tofranil 

00:07:45
[music] 

00:07:50
SEAN HARRIGAN And Protriptyline, Vivactil. A potentially serious side effect that may occur with TCA's is Atropinic or anticholinergic overload. And old but descriptive phrase outlines the more obvious symptoms. Red as a Beet, Dry as a Bone and Mad as a Hatter. Red as a Beet describes the patients skin tone which becomes obviously flush due to the ensuing hyperpyrexia. Dry as a Bone refers to the extreme dryness of the mouth and skin on extension of the more common anticholinergic effect seen with normal doses, often marked by an intense desire of fluid. Mad as a Hatter refers to an increase in psychotic symptoms, including delirium, agitation, hallucinations, hyptertension, twitching and seizures. This symptom may lead to the misdiagnosis of receiving too little medication. Excessive medication is a primary factor in atropinic overload. So increasing the dose will only worsen the symptoms. Some atropinic-like chemicals are components in a variety of cold and gastrointestinal medications. In addition to try cyclic antidepressants, drug classes that can contribute to atropinic overload include antihistamines and some Neuroleptic and Antiparkinson agents. If these symptoms arise, hold the next dose of medication, take the patients vital signs and notify the physician and pharmacist immediately. 

00:09:40
MAOIs 

00:09:45
[music] 

00:09:50
SEAN HARRIGAN MAOIs include Phenelzine, Nardil and Tranylcypromine, Parnate. They have serious drug food and drug, drug interactions. Hypertensive crisis are sudden severe rise in blood pressure is the most common. 

00:10:15
DAVID SANTANA You all right? 

00:10:20
BRENNAN KELLEHER Yeah, I'm good. I'm just feeling nicely like a timeout for a second. 

00:10:20
DAVID SANTANA Okay. 

00:10:20
BRENNAN KELLEHER I'm taking some new medication. 

00:10:25
DAVID SANTANA Oh, all right. Do you want to like sit down or something? 

00:10:30
BRENNAN KELLEHER Yeah. 

00:10:30

00:10:30
BRENNAN KELLEHER Yeah. 

00:10:30
DAVID SANTANA You're like… 

00:10:35
SEAN HARRIGAN Patients taking MAOIs must be warned against eating foods containing Tyramine, including aged meats and cheeses, chocolate, caffeine containing beverages, beer, and red wine. They must also avoid decongestants, stimulants, Dextromethorphan, a common ingredient in over the counter cough medicine, appetite suppressants, Carbamazepine, Tegretol and other antidepressants. In addition to the marked increase in blood pressure, severe occipital headaches, heart palpitations, nausea, vomiting, nuchal rigidity or neck stiffness, intolerance to light and headache, high fever, sweating, chest pain and coma may occur. 

00:11:35
BRENNAN KELLEHER Let me just, maybe it's better standing. 

00:11:35
DAVID SANTANA Okay. 

00:11:40

[music] 

00:11:45
BRENNAN KELLEHER No. 

00:11:50
DAVID SANTANA Okay. You want like some… 

00:11:50
SEAN HARRIGAN Hypertensive crisis is a lift threatening side effect and the physician must be notified immediately. 

00:11:55
BRENNAN KELLEHER It's okay now. 

00:12:00
DAVID SANTANA Okay. Do you want me… Do you want me maybe like care center or something like that?

BRENNAN KELLEHER Yeah, it's not… I don't need to go like… Yeah, just like… 

00:12:05
DAVID SANTANA Okay. 

00:12:10
SEAN HARRIGAN Because of this and other side effects, MAOI's are now less commonly prescribed. 

00:12:15
BRENNAN KELLEHER I'll be here. 

00:12:15
DAVID SANTANA Okay. I'll be right back. 

00:12:15
BRENNAN KELLEHER Thank you. 

00:12:20

JOSH DOMINGO Yeah. Just… 

00:14:05
NATASHA HARRIS Just a little… 

00:14:05
JOSH DOMINGO You know the weather is gonna nauseated and it grows. 

00:14:10
SEAN HARRIGAN Serotonin Syndrome is a potentially life threatening drug reaction related to the use of SSRIs and SNRIs. It is also called Hyperserontonemia, Serotonin Toxicity or Serotonergic Syndrome. It occurs when nerve cells produce excessive serotonin or prevent the body from clearing it. This usually occurs when two drugs interact causing both increase production and reduced clearing of serotonin. For example combining Triptans or serotonin receptor agonists use for treating migrane headaches such as Sumatriptan, Imitrex, with an SSRI or SNRI could accelerate the build-up of serotonin. Symptoms of Serotonin Syndrome include agitation, nausea, diarrhea, tachycardia, elevation or rapid fluctuations in blood pressure, hallucinations, fever, sweating, shivering, Ataxia, 

00:15:20
[sil.] 

00:15:30
SEAN HARRIGAN Hyperreflexia, and myoclonus. 

00:15:35
[sil.] 

00:15:40
SEAN HARRIGAN Serotonin Syndrome usually occurs when the medication is first prescribed or the dose is increased and can happen within minutes. 

00:15:45
NATASHA HARRIS Okay. How is your hand's beeing shaking? Like that has that been… How long is that being going on? 

00:15:55
JOSH DOMINGO This afternoon. 

00:15:55
NATASHA HARRIS This afternoon. Okay. 

00:16:00
JOSH DOMINGO Yeah. And I figure it's drug, new drug, right? 

00:16:00
NATASHA HARRIS Right. 

00:16:05
SEAN HARRIGAN Misdiagnosis may occur because symptoms may resemble those of infection, intoxication, metabolic disorders, neuroleptic malignant syndrome or drug withdrawal. This can delay treatment and increase the potential for a bad outcome. Other medications associated with Serotonin Syndrome include MAOIs, Meperidine, Demerol and Dextromethorphan. Drugs of abuse including Ecstacy and LSD have also been associated with the syndrome. And overdose of cocaine, Lithium or an MAOI can mimic Serotonin Syndrome. Treatments includes Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, Valium or Lorazepam, Ativan, IV fluids and withdrawal of the medications that trigger the event. A drug such as Cyproheptadine, Periactin maybe given to block serotonin production allowing levels to normalize. Discontinuation Syndrome may occur if an antidepressant is stopped abruptly. Symptoms will vary depending on the class of antidepressant. With SSRIs symptoms include nausea, dizziness, lethargy and headache, while abrupt withdrawal tricyclics can cause hypomania, akathisia, cardiac arrthythmias, GI upset and panic attacks. MAOIs symptoms include flulike symptoms, confusion, hypomania, and the worsening of depression. Because of this all antidepressants should be tapered gradually. 

00:18:00
MISCELLANEOUS SIDE EFFECTS 

00:18:05
[music] 

00:18:10
UNKNOWN Well, talk to me about it. 

00:18:10
SEAN HARRIGAN Priapism or a prolonged or inappropriate penile erection is a rare side effect, sometimes associated with the medication Trazodone, Desyrel. If this occurs, the medication should be seized immediately and the physician notified. Potentially fatal liver failure has been reported with a use of Nefazodone, Serzone. Patients prescribed this drug should be warned about potential symptoms of liver dysfunction including jaundice, anorexia, GI complaints or malaise. And to report them should they arise. 

00:18:50
MOOD STABILIZING AGENTS 

00:18:55
[music] 

00:19:00
BIPOLAR DISORDER 

00:19:05
MANIC DEPRESSIVE 

00:19:10
SEAN HARRIGAN Lithium remains the most common drug used for the treatment of bipolar disorder. It is commonly paired with other psychotropic medications for better symptom control. Lithium Toxicity can occur whether or not the patient is on more than one drug. However combining lithium with other medications can sometimes compound the problem by compromising the body's ability to eliminate the drug through the kidneys. Acute toxicity occurs with accidental or deliberate overdose. Toxicity can also occur more slowly and become chronic when someone is on a dose that is a little too high. It can also occur if a patient on a correct dose for an extended period of time takes just a little too much, such as forgetting that the medication has been taken and taking it again. Acute or chronic dehydration as well as other health conditions can also have an adverse effect on systemic concentration or clearing of the drug. Symptoms of lithium toxicity include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, incontinence, abdominal pain, weakness, an unsteady gait or slurring of speech that mimes intoxication and memory problems. There may be muscle twitches, slurred speech, nystagmus and fine motor tremors that can interfere with the ability to write, draw or use tools. Blood level greater than 1.5 mmol/liter can become life threatening. At 2 mmols greater, the patient can experience seizers, coma and even death. Cardiac problems are relatively rare, but do occur. Ongoing serum levels and monitoring of urine output, well, on the drug can alert the healthcare provider of developing problems before there are obvious symptoms. Intervention should begin immediately when an adverse reaction is suspected. If recognized early, elevated lithium levels can be quickly lowered usually with few or no []. However severe or prolonged low grade toxicity can be damaging to the kidneys and neurologic system. Patients on lithium and their caregiver should be told that excessive heat or sunlight should be avoided while on the drug. If toxicity is suspected, lithium levels should be drawn immediately and intervention begun. Diagnostic and treatment modalities include rehydration with IV fluids, providing medications to control nausea and decrease vomiting and in some cases renal dialysis. In acute overdose, activated charcoal via NG tube and orogastric lavage maybe ordered. Patients with neurologic symptoms may have permanent effects including memory loss, and mood disorders. The incidents of these increases, the longer the toxicity is left undressed. 

00:22:30
ANTICONVULSANTS 

00:22:35
[music] 

00:22:40
SEAN HARRIGAN Anticonvulsants have several potential adverse reactions. The Pyruvic Acid, Depakote can prolong bleeding time. The platelet count and bleeding time should be monitored and the patient observe for spontaneous bleeding or unexplained bruising. Topiramate, Topamax can decrease the effect of oral contraceptives. So women will need education regarding the need for alternate contraceptives while on this medication. All antiepileptic drugs increase the risk of suicide. Symptoms to be reported include escalation of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior and odd changes in mood or behavior. 

00:23:25
ANTIANXIETY AGENTS 

00:23:30
[music] 

00:23:35
SEAN HARRIGAN In addition to antipsychotics and antidepressants, other medications may be used for the treatment of anxiety, including Benzodiazepine such as Clonazepam, Klonopin, 

00:23:45
[music] 

00:23:50
SEAN HARRIGAN Lorazepam, Ativan, and Alprazolam, Xanax. 

00:24:00
[music] 

00:24:05
SEAN HARRIGAN Clonazepam is an anticonvulsant and carries an FDA black box warning regarding an increase in suicide and suicide ideation when taken for depression. Benzodiazepines have a rapid onset, but carry increase risks of both dependants and tolerance. They are usually reserved for short-term use then slowly withdrawn or during an acute episode when rapid onset is needed. The most common side effects are drowsiness and dizziness. Buspirone, BuSpar, is an antianxiety medication used to treat GAD or Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Although effective, it takes at least two weeks for Buspirone to begin. It has a relatively low side-effect profile, but because of the slow onset is not used as a prn medication for acute episodes. 

00:25:00
[sil.] 

00:25:05
SEAN HARRIGAN Sometimes these drugs cause paradoxical excitement which manifests as excessive talkativeness, excitement, movement or emotional release, symptoms which need to be reported to the physician. They may also increase the effects of other CNS depressants. Patients on antianxiety medications should avoid alcohol and not take other CNS depressants. Because the side-effects of psychotropic medications are extensive with a wide variety of symptoms, perhaps the most important task for the caregiver is to be attentive to anything on unusual and the symptoms the patient's reports or in the behavioral or physical symptoms that they exhibit. When this awareness is coupled with a sound understanding of the psychotropic medications and their side-effects. The caregiver should be able to recognize these symptoms when they occur and take the actions needed to remedy them. Doing so can not only help ease the patient through their treatment, but may also have the potential to save the patients life.
