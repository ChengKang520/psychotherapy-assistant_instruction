The Evolution of Psychotherapy OUT OF THE BLUE: Six Non-Medication Ways to Relieve Depression Bill O'Hanlon 

00:00:00
BILL O'HANLON All right, let's start. I'm Bill O'Hanlon. Uhm , I left my cellphone up here to remind me to tell you to turn your cellphones off or on to the stun mood or whatever won't disturb the people around you, uhm, or yourself, or me. Uhm, so thank if you'd remember that. I know it's little hard your making your calls and doing your text. Uhm, and this Out of the Blue: Six Non-Medication Ways to Relieve Depression. I have book on that with its title come out in April from Norton. Uhm, it's my 36 book stop maybe before I write again.

00:00:45
BILL O'HANLON And there's a whirlwind tour cuz obviously there's a lot to this so I'm gonna give you as much of the details I can in the time that we have allotted and hopefully, we'll have some time for questions as well, uhm, but we'll just have to see how the, the, ah, times goes.

The Evolution of Psychotherapy OUT OF THE BLUE: Six Non-Medication Ways to Relieve Depression Bill O'Hanlon Visiting Depresso-Land • My Story 

00:01:05
BILL O'HANLON So the first thing because, oh, my eyes. My eyes is something strange. Uhm, I'll start in a little personal way. I, I sort to became a therapist because I was depressed when I was younger. I, uhm, I grow up in a big Irish Catholic Family around Chicago, Chicago Suburbs. I grew up in La Grange, Illinois and family had this value that when you're 18, you went out to work or you went to university. Fa-- first of all, they needed your room but secondly, they wanted to encourage independence and I was the middle child, I was the least prepared to go out. I was very shy, very anxious, ah, kid and they really encourage you to go and I went a long way. I went to Arizona State University so it's thousands of miles away from my home in, ah, in Chicago and I was lost. You know, I go into the 101 class, it'd be 500 people and I was so shy. I made a couple of friends but they were about shy and alienated as I was. 

00:02:20
Visiting Depresso-Land • My Story 

00:02:20
BILL O'HANLON I become a hippie, I grow my hair down here, and experimented with some of those psychotropic, ah, substances that were popular at the time when I was first go into college and start taking philosophy in both. Why I mention the psychotropic drugs is and the, and the philosophy as both of those combined and then leaving the nest of my, uhm, quite big and almost village like family that I begin to question everything. You know, and it was that time of, you know, the hippie rebellion and protesting against the world and everything was, you know, in question. It was sort of epistemological questioning time and I just lost my sense of reality. You know, I'm like can you even trust anything? You know, I take a couple of micrograms of this substance and awhile it start to melt and you know, it's as solid as I thought and I took philosophy and they say there's anything really real. And you know, when I start reading Jean Paul Sartre and, you know, Nausea, not a good thing to read when you're getting depress. Uhm, and I just became more and more isolated. I start to sleep four hours every day. I have no idea about depression at the time but I became severely depressed and after month, and nobody missed me at school because there were 500 people in the class. They wouldn't tell if I were there or not and, uhm, finally, I just decided I just-- why do people get out of bed? What's the po-- why? What's the point? I mean everything is sort of an illusion and everything is fake. There's no meaning on anything. It takes a lot of effort to do this stuff and, you know, I just couldn't be around people. I felt like I had no skin on. I was so sensitive and, you know, everything hurt. I just felt like I was all exposed nerves to be around people and I was-- at the same time I was lonely and, you know, but I couldn't talk to people cuz I was sort of bound up inside. So it just became worst and worst and finally, I decided I'm gonna do myself, man. I just can't do this anymore. 

00:04:15
Visiting Depresso-Land • My Story 

00:04:15
BILL O'HANLON And, you know, I was a nice Midwest kid so I was thinking on, am I gonna do this to my friends? I gotta go and say goodbye to them so they won't be, you know, shock and I won't be rude just checking out without saying goodbye. So I got to my first couple of friends and basically, their reaction cuz they're really depressed and unhappy and, you know, they're like, their, their responses, "I admire your courage. I would do that but I'm so afraid to die." And so you know, they were pretty supportive and, uhm, and we also had this had this word, you know, "I'll see you next life. I'm sure that'll be better because we suffered so much in this life. We'll have better life next time." So, so, then I came in third and final friend that I was gonna say goodbye to and she was more normal and she was like, "What? You kill, kill you-- you can't kill you. Why would you kill yourself? That is just not o-- well, what do you mean?" I was like though the other ones were so supportive I wouldn't have my arguments marshal very well but finally, I got myself together and I said, "Look, you know, I just can't do this. I, I'm too sensitive to be around people. Even when I'm with myself I unhappy so there's no safe place." So I said, "You know, all I wanna do is write poetry, not be around people. I, you know, I, I sleep 20 hours a day so how am I gonna earn a living? You know, we're in this protected environment at the university. In a couple of year, I'm gonna have to go and get a job for some American evil corporation, you know, that makes napalm to drop on babies so I think I just can't do it, you know. Morally, I just don't think I can't do it and physically, I just can't do it so what, you know, the future is even worse than the pre-- I just won't be able to do it so why not just check out and I'll save myself a couple of years of misery." And so, she's like, no, no, no. She said, "Look, I have three aunts that have never married. They have no children. I'm their favorite niece. They live in Nebraska which is where my folks where from so I knew the area." And they said-- and she said, "They've told me when they die, I'm gonna inherent everything from them. They've save their money. They've been very frugal but they've also invested their money and one of the things they invested in is farmland. So if you'll promise me you won't kill yourself, I will promise when one of those aunts dies, you can go live rent free in one of the farmhouses on one of these empty farms, you know, cuz the neighbors has farmed it cuz the farm were sold and move to town. Now, there's empty farmhouse, you can go and live in one of these empty farmhouses. You don't have to be around with anybody. You can write your poetry, you can grow your own food so you don't have to earn money. " And then my delusional state reading, mother at news at 19, I was sure I can grow my own food. You and I, I actually try it years later, it's really hard to grow your own food and you can't grow a pizza. I discover it takes a lot of year to get a pizza together. Uhm, so, so, you know, I was like, hmm, and that really sort of grab me and I-- but I didn't jump yet I said, you know, so that's a possibility. I said, "How old are your aunts?" She said, "They're are in their 60s." And to me at 19 like they're almost dead, you know, now that I'm in that age, I'm like this pretty young really as relatively you know, and, ah, and it turned out those aunts live like 100. There's something in the water in Nebraska. They never died and it did that I wouldn't have made it, you know, if I waited for them but I, I convince myself. You know, there three of them and the odds are while I'm just has gonna kick off in the next couple of years. You know, they're really old and so I agree with her not to kill myself. Now, the first thing that happen when that happened is I was no longer suicidal. I just-- suicide went away. I was still depressed though and I became obsessed with how do people find meaning, you know, it's DeFra-- DeFranco question may answers from meaning. How did they get along with themselves and other people so that they're not so miserable when they're lead medium become a psychotherapist. Of course, thank you. That was a nice story. They liked it over there. Wow, geez, really. Yeah. Let's show them a true applause sounds like, yeah, an appreciation, you know, and acknowledge and so thank you for that. All right, that's wonderful.

00:08:45
BILL O'HANLON So, you know, I was on those days just so you know, I'm not lying to you. I never had a picture taken when it was now over there but that's how I spent most of my time and got really good at guitar. I would sit for hours and when I wasn't sleeping and play the blues in me, I can play the blues in me like almost nobody know. It's really good. Uhm, and there's the farmhouse in my future but I never got to live there because on the way to, you know, waiting for that farmhouse to be available when those damn aunts to die, I found meaning, I found purpose and I found a way to get along with myself and other people and I found, you know, a reason to live, if you will, and a way out of that depression. It took me awhile. It wasn't as bad as time went on but it lasted for awhile. So I tell you that because I'm gonna tell you some things that are not orthodoxy in terms of helping people emerge from the tough stuff that, that can be depression. You know I want you to know I take it seriously even though that star was lighthearted, it was try of the hardest thing I ever went through with my life. And I really-- so I developed a real sensitivity and a real empathy for people who are going through that dark night of soul as people call it, right?

Challenging Myths • Myths about depression • Cause is known (biochemical and genetic) • Despite the ads one sees on TV, th e cause of depression is not known and has not been established as biochemical or genetic • "For most common diseases, specific genes are almost never associated with more than a 20-30% chance of getting sick," explains Bryan Welser, CEO of gene discovery company Perlegen Sciences. (Quoted in Wired, Nov. 009, p.121) • "The strongest predictor of major depression is still your life experience. There aren't genes that make you depressed. There are genes that make you vulnerable to depression." -Kenneth Kendler, M.D., Professor of Psychiatry and Genetics Medical College of Virginia, TIME, March, 2001 • Cause determines intervention 

00:10:05
BILL O'HANLON So let's talk about some of the myths first and then I'll talk-- tell you these six methods, the six ways of thinking about and approaching depression. Uhm, so the first one is that, if you look at TV commercials, they will try and convince that the cause for depression is known. They show there's cool little chart with all these neurotransmitters going and then getting messed up and their medication. We'll fix it and that is just not science, it's in theory and it's an interesting theory but the cause of depression is not known yet. It's the great scientific consensus that says this is true. We have hypothesis and I'm gonna give you a couple of hypothesis. Despite the ads cuz, you know, the cure for depression is not again known, the cause of it and the cure for this is not known and it's not clearly established as primarily a biochemical or genetic, although, a few asked almost everyone in modern societies, they will tell you. It's a brain disease but again, here is one of the CEOs of, ah, gene discovery com-- company who knows a lot about genetics and here's what he says, this physician. "For most common diseases, specific genes are almost never associated with more than a 20 to 30% chance of getting sick," he was talking generally about, uhm, disease process. "The strongest predictor of major depression is still your life experiences. There aren't genes that make you depressed," says another physician, professor of psychiatry. "There are genes that make you vulnerable to depression." So this genetic causation is an overstatement of the ideas and their pharmaceutical companies that have an eye, you know, have a stake in convincing as to that and the-- and this is a common idea. The second thing is even if it were true and establish as the truth that biochemistry or genetics causes depression that doesn't necessarily mean the intervention has to be biochemical or, you know a medications, right? If you truly believe in the mind, body connection, then you know, they're talking to people changes their brains interacting with people being in a different environment change a bit. When people move from a different country to another country. They start to develop depression at the rate of that country. I suspect that their genetics don't change. Maybe, their biochemistry does cuz they eat differently in their different environment but their genetics certainly don't change when they move from one country to another. So we know there's-- it's basically, multifactorial thing. So I see some people taking pictures to that size. It's totally fine with me if you do but I'm gonna give you this slides so you don't have to if you don't want. There'll be on my website as soon as we're done so don't worry about it. If you don't, if you don't want to, you wanna take pictures of that's totally fine with me and the other thing I'll say I've-- I have handouts on the website if you haven't gotten those and when I give you this slides you're welcome to use them in any way you would like if you wanna share this stuff with colleagues or anybody else that's appropriately with. I always give you permission to use my slides and my handouts so feel free to do it. You're welcome.

00:13:20
BILL O'HANLON I've got enough money. I'm out here to change the world. So the other myth is antidepressants and the only effective treatment. And I think most of you here probably don't believe that but a lot of people in general public do and all physicians do isn't just the truth and either presents aren't the only one effective treatment. You even talk to Scott Miller who is back earlier, I don't know if he's still back there but he'll, he'll hang you for a couple of hours about that but, uhm, he knows the research a lot better than I do. 

00:13:45
What This Presentation Offers • Six strategies: New possibilities for effective intervention • These are alternate approaches to use with clients/patients with whom your usual approaches have not helped or to supplement your current methods and approaches 

00:13:50
BILL O'HANLON So I'm not so interested in all of that. Let somebody else have those debates. What I'm interested in is helping people relieve their suffering because I know it from the inside out and I don't think people need to suffer and we all know that sometimes you treat them with medications and it does help them a bit but it doesn't solve everything. And then there are some people that don't get help on medications. There's some people who have bad side effects. There's some people who won't take them. You know, there are lots of reasons so I started my career as a drug and alcohol treatment, in a drug and alcohol treatment facility and there was only one way to help people in that time. We only helped about 20 to 30% of people ultimately and took them years often to get solved it and to really s-- has stopped having those problems. Now, there's a little more diversity, Bill Miller is here, another Miller, ah, who's talked about another approach to approaching people with drug and alcohol issues and I hope we get more because we're not helping everybody. We need to help same thing with depression, we're not helping 100% until we do. We shouldn't stop with an orthodoxy. We should have as many possible approaches that might help relieve suffering. So this is my idea, I ha-- I've come up with over the years base on my training, my clinical experience, and may look at the research, six alternate interventions that can either be combined with medication or, or alternate to, uhm, medications and some of the traditional treatments. Again, these are alternate approaches so if you're skeptical about them you can just use them with the people your traditional stuff or your regular stuff doesn't work with or you'll-- some of these will validate what you're already doing because you'll go I do that and that's good. But if you're not using this, just try this out to supplement your other approaches, the rest an alternatives. So again, because I'm a fairly lighthearted person at this point and I use humor to teach, I want you to know I do take the experience to depression very seriously in the suffering of it and I was listening to radio interview of Terry Gross' Fresh Air for some of you know that cuz we were in United States probably, you know, she's a terrific interview and she's interviewing Andrew Solomon who wrote a book on depression called The Noonday Demon, uhm, after he suffered a severe depression and she's been interviewing him asking about his depression and his recovery and he had the most poignant description. That was the closest to my experience of depression I've ever heard. You know, it's hard cuz when you're in that stage it's sort a null and bleak and, you now, it's really hard to have language to even communicate to people and so I wanted to play this so we know what we're dealing with. 

00:16:25
What This Presentation Offers • Six strategies: New possibilities for effective intervention • These are alternate approaches to use with clients/patients with whom your usual approaches have not helped or to supplement your current methods and approaches Depression can be devastating Andrew Solomon (author of "The NoonDay Demon") 

00:16:25
BILL O'HANLON So we're on the same page, you know, what we're dealing with and also the-- have you hear Andrew Solomon who's I think very articulate spoke person for depress people. That was the best description I have ever heard of my experience of depression and a lot of people with whom I've worked. Obviously, it's different for different people and different moments but you'll hear from Andrew Solomon when they get a couple of times during this presentation, uhm, because I think you has, uhm, uhm, but he's very articulate. He went around the world studying how different cultures a lot of what we call depression and how they go about helping people with the experience of depression. 

00:17:00
Depression as multi-factored • Biochemistry is only part of the story 

00:17:00
BILL O'HANLON So, uhm, I would make a, a broader point and then I think it's multifactorial, you know, people want us simplified and say, "This is the cause of it. This is a quick solution." You know, it's different for everybody and it's multifactorial. That's why I played you that little clip. And here is the guy who takes a bunch of medications, whose father is a pharmaceutical executive and he says it's more complicated than that. So that's introduction I wanna give you. 

00:17:25
The Six Strategies #1 Walking out of depresso-land #2 Undoing depression #3 Shifting relationship with depression #4 Challenging isolation/restoring and strengthening connections #5 A future with possibilities #6 Re-starting brain growth 

00:17:25
BILL O'HANLON Now, let's gets to the six strategies. I'll just give you the quick overview so if you wanna leave right away you just know already what's gonna be in here. Uhm, cuz there's a lot of other cool people presenting right now, seven of them, and I can tell you that and I wanna see some of those people too. Uhm, walking out of depresso-land is the first one. The second one, I'll call undoing depression. The third one, we'll talk about shifting the relationship with depression. The fourth one, we'll talk about challenging isolation, restoring, and strengthening connections. Fifth one, a future with possibilities. The last one, re-starting brain growth. 

00:18:00
#1 Walking out of depresso-land Mapping times of depression and feeling better • Investigate times and aspects of non-depression while finding out about depressive experience 

00:18:00
BILL O'HANLON Uhm, so let's take them one at time. We'll go through them as quickly as we can. As long as we cover them comprehensively. The first thing I do, you know, when I was on the graduate student in psychology, I had a professor who studied state dependent learning, a guy named Rossi the different, different Rossi in the (inaudible ) is here and he has to put goggles on chickens and stuff. He did really weird, ah, experiment and, uhm, and, and perceptual psyche and he really was doing a lot of the primary research in, in state dependent learning. When you're in one state, you tend to associate a lot of stuff and when you're in that, you know, it's like you study in the blue room. Do you take the test in the blue room. You'll recall more than if you take the test in the red room. They are just cues internally and externally that evokes certain states and this Rossi or any Rossi has written about that as well and when people are-- I'm sure you've experience this or heard about it, when they're depressed, sometimes they think they never had a good experience in their life. They have no good memory. You asked them about a good memory. I've never had anything good happen to me. Now, if they get better and they start feel better, yeah, yeah, this happen and we tend to remember the state we're in. It's you know affect affects it and things like that. So one of the first things I do is I help people walk out of depression land by mapping what their experience to depression is and what their experience have knocked depression is. And I sometime call this marveling. I'm gonna ask about depression then you know, so tell me about the day, ah, you know, what's it like when you've been depress? And then, contrast that with the day when you haven't been depress. You know, do you get out of bed any quicker and do you sleep longer. Do you sleep? You know, I just asked and I start to go back and forth and it starts to evoke non depress states is all I can say. And then they're not so stuck in it when I start to do other interventions that might invite them more out of this experience with depression. All right, so I wanna investigate times and aspect of non-depression while finding out about the depressive experience while really listening to them and connecting to them and learning about their experience which is again always individual. I think with the way I learned when I was trainer in psychotherapist to ask about depression is. Tell me about your family history of depression, tell me about your experience to depression and they don't do this marveling and sometimes people got more depressed. Just because we were revoking more but it kind of if you will reinforcing it. 

00:20:35
Focul mainly on Depression could add to the problem • A recent study shows that extensive discussions of problems and encouragement of "problem talk," rehashing the details of problems, speculating about problems, and dwelling on negative affect in particular, leads to a significant increase in the stress hormone cortisol, which predicts increased depression and anxiety over time. Byrd-Craven, J., Geary, D. C., Rose, A. J., & Ponzi, D. (2008). "Co-ruminating increase stress hormone levels in women," Hormones and Behavior, 53, 489-492. 

00:20:35
BILL O'HANLON You know, there's some research on this that focusing mainly on depression could actually add to the stress and depression. Ah, study, uhm, show that extensive discussion of problems and encouragement of problem talk, rehashing the details of problems, speculating about problems, dwelling on negative affect in particular leads to a significant increase in the stress hormone cortisol which predicts increased depression and anxiety over time. So the more you're talking about and the therapy, the way I learn therapy before I started to study with Milton Erickson and before I started to create my own ideas about the solution orient approach is sort a bias towards the negative. 

00:21:10
Therapy often focuses on what is wrong "Look, making you happy is out of the question but I can give you a compelling narrative for your misery." 

00:21:15
BILL O'HANLON Here's this New Yorker cartoon, you know, and it says, that you know, we can-- making you happy is out of the question but we can give you a really compelling narrative for your misery. You know, that's, that's what therapist can do for you. And I think that there'll be often focuses on what's wrong. Ah, ah, it has-- that's change over the last few years as result the positive psychology in solution and strength base approaches. 

00:21:35
Acknowledgment and Possibility • An alternative is to move back and forth between discussions of depression and non-depressive moments and experiences. • This moves the person out of state-dependent memories and biases for brief interludes and makes change easier • This not only respectfully acknowledges the person's painful and discouraging experiences, but gives them a reminder they aren't and haven't always been depressed. • It can also illuminate and give hints to skills, abilities, and connections that can potentially lead out of depression or at least reduce depression levels. 

00:21:35
BILL O'HANLON So I think good therapy of any kind of problem stands on two legs. One is the acknowledgment, the joining of them in their misery and stuckness. And the other one is inviting them into new possibilities and challenging that place. And so the best therapy that moves fluidly back and forth between joining and inviting. Joining and acknowledging and opening possibilities and so that's what this method does. It really moves back and forth between discussions of the depressive and non depressive moments an experiences in environments, in thoughts, and all that kind of stuff and it moves that person of that state dependence stuff. It respectfully acknowledge to the person painful and discouraging experiences but gives them a reminder they aren't and haven't always been depressed and they may not always be depress in the future. And they can also illuminate and give hints to skills, abilities and connections, resources that can potentially lead out of depression or a least reduce depression levels. 

00:22:40
Letter from Abraham Lincoln to Fanny McCullough after she was distraught over the loss of her father in the Civil War Dear Fanny It is with deep grief that I learn of the death of your kind and brave Father; and, especially, that it is affecting your young heart beyond what is common in such cases. In this sad world of ours, sorrow comes to all; and, to the young, it comes with bitterest agony, because it takes them unawares. The older have learned to ever expect it. I am anxious to afford some alleviation of your present distress. Perfect relief is not possible, except with time. You cannot now realize that you will ever feel better. Is not this so? And yet it is a mistake. You are sure to be happy again. To know this, which is certainly true, will make you some less miserable now. I have had experience enough to know what I say; and you need only to believe it, to feel better at once.

00:22:40
BILL O'HANLON Now, uhm, I gonna give you, I gonna give you an introduction to this. I was, uhm, ah, giving a workshop in Oklahoma and I was asked to the night before my two-day workshop to come to, uhm, a banquet that they were having the, the fro-- as a fund raiser from mental health services in the community in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And they had a keynote speaker who written a book called Lincoln's Melancholy and I had no idea about this. Lincoln was suicidality depressed twice in his life and he had a tendency towards depression his whole life. Uhm, and he therefo-- ah, but he learned a way to handle it. He was sort of had a tendency of depression all his life but he never went back into a suicidal or deep depression after his first two which were in relatively his young years and his early adult years. And, uhm, he-- this acknowledgement possibility, this keynote speaker that was doing this at the ban-- at the fundraising banquet with the night for a guy name Joshua Shenk Wolf wrote a book called Lincoln's Melancholy and he read a letter than Lincoln wrote in the middle civil war when the north was losing the civil war and he was really busy. Everybody wanted peace and everybody was criticizing him. His generals were doing what he wanted and he took some time out of his busy schedule and he wrote a very short letter to the daughter of one of his chi-- ah, generals that have been killed the year before and after her father died, she took to her and been depressed for a year and she was 21 years old. And, you know, he was-- he heard about this to the great, finally, he sat down and wrote this letter and to me this letter illustrates this first principle that we're talking about. About bal-- marveling depression and non-depression, the hopelessness and hope. And if those of you who know Milton Erickson's work, it also sounds in one section a great idea like what Milton Erickson did. You'll recognize the piece if you know Ericksonian work. All right, so let me just read you this, uhm, this letter, ah, which again you can find in Lincoln's Melancholy. And you can also find it, I think, in, ah, Team of Rivals, Doris Kearns Goodwin, ah, book. 

00:24:40

00:24:40
BILL O'HANLON Dear Fanny, it is with deep grief that I learn of the death of your kind and brave Father; and, especially, that it is affecting your young heart beyond what is common in such cases. Now, I have italicized the part that I think is really the invitation to change. He's, he's validating her. He's joining with her. He's sympathizing with her and he's inviting her beyond the depression. And, especially, that it is affecting your young heart beyond what is common in such cases. In this sad world of ours, sorrow comes to all and, to the young, it comes with bitterest agony, because it takes them unawares. The older have learned to ever expect it. I am anxious to afford some alleviation of your present distress. Perfect relief is not possible, except with time. You cannot now realize that you will ever feel better. Is not this so? I feel like reading that in Erickson's voice for some reason because it sounds a lot like what the kind of stuff he said to people. You cannot now realize that you will ever feel better. Is not this so? And yet it is a mistake. You're sure to be happy again. To know this, which is certainly true, will make you some less miserable now. I have had experience enough to know what I say; and you need only to believe it, to feel better at once. It's such a kind and sympathetic letter and also he said, "You're gonna come out to this. I know it, you're gonna come out of this and if you know that, that will help you get through it a lot better." And that is the essence of what I'm talking about with this first strategy, join with people invite them out. Join with people invite them out and they will tell you when they're ready to move. They won't move until they are.

Make maps of depresso-land and non-depresso-land • Compare and contrast and build maps of feelings, actions, thoughts, focus of attention, interactions and contexts associated with both depressive experience and non-depressive experience 

00:26:30
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, it won't happen so here's the-- one of the ways I do this. I, I even make a map sometimes of depresso-land and non-depresso-land. You know, I-- if we're gonna be geographers or anthropologist and we were gonna study this land of depression, what would be features of it or be the thoughts, the behaviors, the interactions, the clothing, the, you know, environment you're in? Tell me about depression and then tell me about non-depression. All right, so we're gonna compare and contrast and go back and forth if you dwell too much on the negative. They might get sink into it. If you dwell too much in the positive and only do solution talk, they won't feel heard and understood. They won't follow you there. 

00:27:15
Elaine's map Depresso-land Confident/Competent-land Gets out of bed by 9 a.m. Stays in bed until noon Spends time with women friends Stays alone; talks only to depressed friend or therapist Focuses on good things she has accomplished in the past Focuses on bad things happening in the future Contacts friends Goes to lunch alone Has a job; Goes to work Doesn't have a job or quits job Eats breakfast foods all day Plays music 

00:27:15
BILL O'HANLON So it's both. I play too much to those. I want you to see sort of like I'm just saying how is this, how is this, how is this? And this is Elaine after 12 minutes in that conversation, I and you if you watched it, would know how to do a depression the Elaine's way. So I'm gonna teach you right now how to do a good depression the Elaine way because she was good at it. She knew how to do it and she, she didn't know she knew how to do it. It was interesting. So here's depresso-land at compa-- what she called confidence and competent-land, right? So it was, if she was feeling confident and competent, she will get out of bed by nine o'clock. You didn't hear that. Let's specify till we get back to it and she would go to work or she would get up and go see a friend, or have meet a friend for breakfast. If she (inaudible ) over the weekend or went, or while working. Okay, if she was depressed, she stay in bed until noon. Now, uhm, if she was feeling confident, she would spend time with women friends as opposed to when she was depressed, she would be alone, she would, uhm, talk only to her one of her friends that was really depress and they would commiserate how terrible they felt and how bad the world was and, or she would call her therapist quite regularly in desperation. I'm so depressed. I can't do anything and if her therapist felt she was the dependent personality because she was so needy and was getting irritated with her and that's why she brought her for a consultation. Uhm, she would-- when she was feeling confident and competent, she would focus something she done in the recent past or the long past that she felt good about. She's like, well, you did that, you brush your teeth today. Or, you know, you went out yesterday and apply for a job. That's was good. When she was feeling depressed, she would think about how much worst the future was gonna be that she was gonna deteriorate even more. She prior have to move in with her father and step-mother. She didn't like father too much. She likes her step-mother. Uhm, and then, if they couldn't take care where she'd have to go into psychiatric hospital and she'd be hospitalize for life. So that was the kind of thinking she did when she was depressed, right. So when she was feeling better, she would contact friends, if she was feeling some stress or upset because that was good for to kinda be around her women friends typically. And when she was feeling depressed and she was still working, she would go out to lunch alone and get even more depressed. She would have a job typical. When she's feeling better, she would go to work, when she's not she would spend time alone. She didn't have a job or she quit her job. She would, ah, eat breakfast foods all day when she was depressed. She would stay in her night clothes until seven o'clock at night when might take a shower, all right. She would play music when she was feeling better. Now if, I said, "Okay, in the next movie, you're-- you got a movie part. You're gonna play depressed Elaine. You would know how to do it at least part of it and would know how get yourself to do the good Elaine depression." Well, it's interesting because you also now know how to do the confident, non-depress confident Elaine. Go out with your women friends, get up out of bed by nine o'clock. Now, as we finish this conversation, it was about 50-minute conversation, we made a plan and the plan was she-- and I said, "Where are you now?" And she said, "I'm in the middle of one of these two months depressions." And I said, "Okay, so let's see if we can walk you out of it little more quickly. Let's see if we can walk go out you out of depression land over to a feeling confident and competent. So let's chose one of these things that you could do that doable, that's possible for you to do." And when she decided that seeing her girlfriends and making herse-- making an appointment when she was-- ah, at night when she was feeling a little more energy, she'd call up a girl friend, make an appointment for breakfast the next day before nine o'clock. Because she wouldn't stand up her friends. She would always met her obligation and I said you have to make an appointment everyday this next week because otherwise, you'll tend to have a depress day. You won't get up. You'll stay in your night clothes, you'll eat breakfast cereal, you'll be alone, and she got herself out of bed every day for the next week and she wasn't depressed anymore. She started to come out and, you know, she would then felt wonderful but she started to come out that deep depression. And she told me later, she said, "That's the first time I had a sense I could do anything about it. I used to have just think I had to wait till the biochemical storm passed. I had to wait for my therapist to get me out of it and that took a long time. It didn't happen." So importing things from dep-- from confidence land into depresso-land or getting her to walk out depresso-land and walk over to confidence land. Now you might have a client or a patient and you'd say, if I tell him to get, you know, to get out of bed and get up and, you know, meet a friend. They say, "I can't do that. I'm too depressed. I can't get out of bed." But can you see anything else on that list they could do while their sitting in bed, lay-- lying in bed? They could think about one good thing they've done in the last while. They could just put-- now, maybe they won't be able to do that either but, ah, most to my clients can at least think of one thing they can get themselves credit for. They'll be one thing on this list that doesn't require them getting up or doing stuff. It will be a mental operation. It will be an intentional operation something else like that and so that would have been my fallback position if she said, "I just, you know, that sounds like a good idea but I can't get out of bed." I just wanna find something that's within their realm of possibilities for them to do and to practice it regularly when they're in the midst of depression to find out if they can marvel that experience, or use that as scaffolding to start to move out of that depression. 

00:33:20
Inclusion • Permission • To and not to • "It's okay to feel depressed." • "You don't have to have hope right now." • Inclusion of opposites • "You can be hopeless and have hope at the same time." • Exceptions • "You feel hopeless except when you don't." 

00:33:20
BILL O'HANLON All right, the next thing I do with this in this, terms of this marveling and walking out of depression is a technique that I really learn from learning hypnosis from Erickson. Erickson would did a different kind of hypnosis then that you will go deeply into trance, you know, you will obey. He didn't do authoritarian hypnosis. He did what I call permissive hypnosis. He'd say, "Now, you can go into a trance. You might go into light trance or medium trance, or deep trance and it's okay to go into trance and you don't have to go into a trance. Your unconscious mind, if it's-- that what's right for you can help you go deeper to a trance." He would do this very permissive thing and I start this doing this with people. One and a few of my clients said, "You know what, don't do the rest of hypnosis. Just do more that. For some reason, when you say this, I feel permission just to be as I am," and it's like carriages on steroid. They were feeling so positively regarded and so much permission to be as they were. That was healing in itself and I found this because there's often lot of shame and a lot of self criticism with depression like why am I this way? Why can I just get up? Why can I be cheerful? Why am I such a burden on people? That, that giving them permission and sometimes complex permission so we'll talk about this can-- and I call this inclusion. You know, whatever they think is bad and they should get rid off and shouldn't be a part of them and is shameful, I just bring back in a gentle way and just value it, I guess, and give them permission for. So the first thing is permission to and permission not to have to or not to. So it's okay to feel depressed. They're getting down to themselves. Maybe, some people in their lives are saying you know, snap out of it. Be feel better. Well, you know, you're just making yourself depressed, that kind of stuff. And you don't have to feel, have hope right now. Given permission not to have to have something that they've pressuring themselves or other people are pressuring them to be, or feel, or do and, you know, it's okay to feel depress. So it's okay and you don't have to. It's okay not to and then, there's some more complex thing which is having experience to pressure myself. I wanted to die and I didn't wanna die, right? It's just the truth. I-- death and only wanted to die and I didn't wanna die. I wanted to die and I didn't wanna suffer like this. If there was way to, you know, get out of suffering and that's was the only way. That was good. There was another way, I wanted to have that too. So I didn't wanna suffer, I didn't wanna die, I didn't wanna live. It was a complex reality so that's the second level of inclusion that I often include. You can be hopeless and I have hope at the same time. And, you know, I don't know if you ever experience this but you get somebody come to your office and they announce very seriously and you have take them seriously, "I've got to kill myself. I can't go on." And in the back of my mind, I'm thinking, "You roll out of bed like that dress, put on makeup, fix your hair, and came into my office and tell me you can't go anymore." I think, you know, you have to take it soon, 99% who wants to die and 1% of them is hoping you'll talk, you'll talk them out. That there is somehow, why would they bother? You know, the people are really serious, stayed home, and killed themselves. They never give us a chance to intervene. You know, you're suicidal. You call the suicidal hotline, "I have to kill myself." What? You know, w-- why would tell somebody that because you're hoping that maybe they'll talk you out or rather say something that will relieve the suffering or the panic or whatever it is. So I think, they can-- they have hope and hopelessness at the same moment. And I think just acknowledging that is a great relief for some people cuz they're taking sides sometimes. You know, they're taking one side to the other. All right, and then noticing reception which is the whole basis of what people call solution focus there but yes, just finding exceptions. Tell me about the time when you aren't depress. Tell me about the time when you felt more hope. You feel hopeless except when you don't, right? Because no-- almost no experience to depression is uniform. It waxes and wanes, things like that. 

00:37:30
Discover exceptions, resources and solutions • Find out about moments of non-depression • Find out about what happens when the depression starts to lift differently than during it • Ask why the problem isn't worse • Import strengths and abilities from contexts of competence • Investigate resilience and times of bouncing back from setbacks, tragedies, trauma and troubles 

00:37:30
BILL O'HANLON So that's, ah, you know, again we won't spent too much time cuz there many books about this and training courses and people are presenting here about this but to sort of exceptions resources and solution approach finding out about moments of non-depression, finding out what happens when the depression starts to lift even if they're-- they can't remember moments of depression. How they start to come out of it. That's pretty interesting thing. Ask why the problem isn't worse. You know, sometimes get resources that that way. Import strengths and abilities from some context which they feel competent. You know, their work, a hobby, friendship, any place that you can find it. Investigate resilience and times of bouncing back from any kind of setbacks, or tragedies , or traumas, and troubles in some way. So again, this is the, it's not all depression in our life. When they come in, they're sitting in front of you and it looks like it's all depression but there's a more complex story and I'm saying let's marvel it, okay. 

00:38:30
Depression as a bad trance • Symptom trance vs. coming out of bad trance • Repetition as trance induction 

00:38:30
BILL O'HANLON So I think that sometimes is depression as a bad trance. It's just a place they've got into and it's really, it's kind of self hypnosis in a bad way and it repeats again and again, the same thoughts, the same feelings, the same biochemistry, the same actions or lack of actions, and, you know, so what do I mean by that, I, I think of it as like a symptom trance. Like they're, they are so stuck in this state of it's this kind of a self hypnotic state of misery that they can't find their way out of it very easily and we'll talk about the ne-- and one of the next interventions will be another way to bring people out. It's a second way of talking about it but I'll just give you introduction. Years ago, I, uhm, read this book, Sense and Nonsense in Psychology by Hans Eysenck and it had, it had a section on hypnosis which is partly why I was interested in the book cuz I was learning hypnosis at the time and it tells a story about, ah, British surgeon-- no, no, a medical doctor in training, he's gonna be a surgeon but he didn't quite finish his medical training before he was call up in World War I as a British soldier. So he's out on the battle field in France in World War I and he's just a soldier but he has all his medical training and a French soldier next to him gets blown up, got split apart and he falls on the ground, and he's writhing, and the more he moves the more he's-- more-- hurting himself and the doctor who speak no French just, you know, not much, he knows a little French but not much, he's trying to get the guy to calm down cuz he knows if can get him stop moving, they might be able to get him back to the surgical tech cuz he has been trained in surgery and save his life. But if he keeps moving around, he's dead on the battle field. So in desperate-- he tries to talk to the guy, you know, stop moving and he doesn't know on a French. In finding him desperation, he remembers a demonstration of hypnosis that he saw on medical school. Just one demonstration and remembers the-- what the hypnotist said. So in the little French he has, he start saying to the guy, "Your eyes will close, your eyes will close. Your eyes will close, your eyes will close." To his amazement, the guy goes into a trance and stops moving. And so, you know, they get him back to the tent and the surgeon do save his life and he's in their kinda bragging to the surgeon about how he got this, he hypnotize this guy, you know, based on one lecture that he see on hypnosis and he starts telling him what he said and this, this guys know some of a French and some of a British. They know French much better than he does and they tell him what he actually said is, "Your nose is closing, your nose is closing. Your nose is closing." But it worked anyway because he just kept repeating it. So sometimes you go into trance because of the repetition, right? And your ears are closing, your ears are closing. 

00:41:20
#2 Undoing depression • Pattern intervention •Discover repeating patterns involved with and associated with depressive experience and help the person change those patterns in small or big ways • Patterns of doing, viewing and context • Highlight any places around depression that the person has moments of choice 

00:41:25
BILL O'HANLON So that leads to the second kind of intervention which I call undoing depression. I have a friend, ah, Richard O'Connor who's a psychologist, who wrote a book called this but I think he meant something slightly different than I do but it was somewhat similar. I learned early on when I was I trainer as a marriage and family therapist, I learn systemic approaches. And then, I went to study with Erickson who had a kind of approach that he just help people change their patterns and said he didn't care where they came from, why they had-- it wasn't very a theoretical. He just figure out what they were doing and they gonna do something different. Think something different, feel something different, neurologically do something different, perceptually do something different, and I think that the thing we called depression is not the thing, it's a process. And so without being disrespectful, I think, how do you do a depression? How do you do it neurologically? How do you do it biochemically? How do you do it emotionally? How do you do it relationally? How do you do it cognitively? And if you're a cognitive therapist but you're gonna focus on the cognitive patterns but I think it's multi, again, multifactorial and multiprocess, that is you're doing it in a lot of ways, with other people, by yourself, within your body, outside, with your environment, all that kind of stuff. There's a pattern to it. So we're gonna do this pattern intervention figure out what the repeating patterns are that are hypnotizing the person in part into depression. And then, interrupt those change those patterns and help the person, you know, challenge those patterns in small or big ways so I'll give you some examples and I think there are three places we typically challenge a pattern then in this approach. One is what I call the doing, the next one is the viewing, and the other is the context. The doing includes-- and then we can highlight at any place they have at moment of choice to get and to make those changes. The doing includes the actions, interactions, and they how speak about it that's things they do. And sometimes people have the most choice in the doing cuz they can just talk about it. You say, "I can u-- use a different word with that, you know, rather that I'm such a loser." You got them to change what they say. If they-- we're at a certain clu-- I have remember a years ago I held green while I had this article and he always knew when a patient who is prone to depression. She would come in every six months and she'd be dress all in black and he'd say, "Here we go. She was gonna go into one of her depressive episode. She would dress all in Black." And he has told her one time when she wasn't depress to dress in black, "Will you come in next time dress on black." She came in and started to change the pattern. So that's weird so that was sort of paradoxical step but, ah, the viewing has to do with what your paying attention to and also what meaning you scribe to it. The context is everything that happens around it. Who you around? Where you are? Time and space patterns, connection pattern, we'll get into some of those stuff as we go along 

00:44:30
Undoing depression: Case example • Erickson sends a depressed person to the library 

00:44:30
BILL O'HANLON All right. So let me give you this weird case example. When I was studying with Erickson who would-- could be mystifying. He wasn't the most explicit teacher you ever met. You'd asked him a question, he'll tell you a story. You know, I was like why did you do that, Dr. Erickson? Well, in 1952, there were two psychiatrist came, you know, and it's like and then about an hour later, you think, what question that I asked him and I wonder if he answered it. And you know, and he wouldn't answer directly so I had to figure out from myself. One time he gave me this cases out. He's working with this guy who's depressed and he just couldn't get the guy out of it and they weren't met this in the 50's, they went medications and you know, he didn't use many anyway and, you know, he just couldn't get this guy out of it. So he tells the guy, "Okay, I want you to go," he-- the guy was staying home everyday sleeping and not going out and being really depress. "So I want you to go to the public library and be depressed there." And Erickson is telling me this story and I'm thinking what? Really, what? But of course, like all Erickson's stories, the guy gets totally cured and everything works out. You know, I'm right. So, but I'm like how did going to, you know, so he tells me the story. So the guy goes to the library every day. He used to be depressed at the library instead of being depressed at home. He goes on for months. Erickson still sees him but nothing is changing and one day the guy comes in and tells him the story. You know, I was at the library and it's boring to be sitting at the library all day not doing anything just being depressed so I got and I asked the librarian, you know, do you have any books and articles on spelunking, cave exploring. I've always wanted to know about that. I've never done it. And the librarian leads him over to the stocks and find some periodicals and some, you know books about, this and he begins to take them back to his table and read them. And one day when he shows up to the stock, after a week or two of this exploring, ah, you know, this idea of cave, uhm, cave exploring, he as at the stocks and a guy is there pulling out some of the books and they kinda eye each other wearily and find the guy talks to me and he says, "Look at, you're interested in caving exploring. I've never done it. Have you ever done it?" You know, I'm just reading about it and then, the patient, the guy who have Erickson's say, "No, I, I never done it. I've just read about to it, too." He says, "Look, why don't we go together? There's a cave I'm reading about one of these periodicals in southern Arizona here. Why don't we go together and explore this cave?" And they go and they become friends and they start going out every week and you know, it's like he comes out of his depression. He makes a friend. He start to do things differently. He moves out of his depression. I'm like how did Erickson know that he would go the library and he met somebody and did spelunking. He was like genius, you know, guy and then I've, you know after got less intimidate by Erickson and I start changing his work and writing about and I realize he didn't tell me about the 99 guys he sent to the library that never had anything happen. They were just depressed at the library. He just of course, tell me about the one that had work but you, if you think at the logic, if this guy is sending in his house, nobody is gonna met him and go spelunking with. Nothing new is gonna happened. He's in the same environment doing the same thing, thinking the same thought, eating the same foods and nothing is gonna happen particularly. Because the therapy, something might happen but something wasn't happening so Erickson just change anything he can think of. And you find a thousand if you read Jay Haley's Uncommon Therapy you'll find 100 examples of that kind of (inaudible ) not always with depression, with other things well, in anxiety and marital problems, things like that, eating disorders. Erickson would just had people change the pattern and, you know, for those of your who really into what it is all mean and what's the cause of it. This makes no sense but if you think of how the brain, now, we know about brain plasticity, the more you do the same the more the brain gets screwed, the more you do something different, you learn something new and gets some new experiences. So Erickson knew this long ago about brain plasticity and neurological plasticity and emotional plasticity, and relational plasticity and I think this came out of that. If you keep, you know, it's the old 12 steps saying. You know, if you keep doing what you're do, you'll keep getting what you got, that kind of thing and I think Erickson used that principle and I certainly used that with some of my client. 

00:48:55
How to do a good depression • Stay still, don't do anything that makes you breathe fast or hard • Stay in bed if you can: if not, sit in the same chair or lay on the couch • Isolate: avoid other people • If you can't avoid other people, try to talk to the same person or few people • Talk to them about the same topic, usually how depressed/unhappy you/they are • Sleep during the day and have insomnia at night • Brood on the past, fears, faults and resentments • Imagine the future will be the same or worse than the past or present • Eat terribly; overeat or undereat (whichever one you specialize in), eat junk foods, sugar, fat • Don't pursue hobbies, passions or spiritual interests • Don't drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, and/or use other drugs • Don't ask for help 

00:48:55
BILL O'HANLON So, I, I have made a list one time with one of my clients. We were sort of playing around and I said, "Look, I majored in depression in college and you're really good at depression." So, you know, I know because I've treated a lot of people and you know it cuz experience this. So let's make a list. If we were gonna teach people how do a really good depression, what will be on that list? And this is what we came up with, you know, like, okay, first thing is, if your depressed make sure, you don't go out exercise doing thing that makes you breathe rapidly cuz your depression will be really in danger of going a way. So do not exercise and that he's laughing as he's telling me this, you know, I like yeah, that was true for me I would stay in bed or if I got up, I would sit in a chair and I would read books that's how I escape from reality. I would actually read self help books about depression. I would never do the exercise. I would just read about what was wrong with me and I would get more and more depress as I read that book and I realize how much more dysfunctional I and my family were when I was reading these books? I'm like wow, I more screwed up than I never knew and, uhm, so he said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good one." So stay in bed if you can, if not, sit in the same chair or lay on the couch, all right? All right. Now, isolate and avoid other people. If you run out of people, new input, something can change. Now, if you are around other people, if you can't avoid other people, don't talk to anybody new. Try and stay with the same folks and talk about the same subjects if you can, right? All right. Talk to them about how miserable, unhappy, or you know, you are they are. That be a good topic. Don't stray from that too much. Don't, don't like watch PBS or anything, you know, learn something new. Nothing like that, don't talk about new topics. All right, sleep during the day and have insomnia at night. This is a really good pattern. Brood on the past, you faults, your fears and your resentments. That's a good one. Imagine the future will be the same or worse than the pres-- past or the present. Uhm, eat terribly either overeat or under eat depends on which one you specialize in. Eat junk foods, sugar or fat. Don't pursue hobbies, passions or spiritual interests. Drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, and use other drugs. That's probably good plan and don't ask for help. Now these, if you can get people to do this, you will create for most people a good depressions. Some people stop being able the risk. They are just, you know, immune for some reason but not me. I would be prone for some depression if I did all that stuff and my clients said and then, so, so I've used that list instead since then with some of my client. I go, okay, but here's the list my, my client and I came up with. Do you specialize in any of these? They'll go, "I do number three. Oh, yeah, I'm really good at that." And, you know, and they, they start to laugh a little with me and say, "Oh, that's the one I specialize." You see, I don't read self help book. I read fantasy, science fiction, and that's how I escape. And then, when I come back, nothing is different, the bill collector is still calling cuz I'm at work, you know, that's kind of stuff. 

00:51:50
Undoing depression: Identifying patterns • Location/places • Activities • Timing/Duration • Sequences • People 

00:51:50
BILL O'HANLON And it's a light hearted way to say what part of it is in your influence, is under your influence? A biochemistry is probably not so directly under your influence but where you sit, that's under your influence, probably. You could probably change that. So location and places, you do your depression. Again, I don't mean do your depression in a blaming way, I'm just saying what parts you have access to change. And then activities, what activities or non-activities? The timing and the duration of things. The sequences, what happens first? Then, that's follow by that, follow by that if you can mess around with those sequences. Sometimes, things change, right and the people around. These are pretty typical patterns that I work with people on to find out any place where they have a moment of choice. And then finally, where they can experiment with it to create possibilities, all right. 

00:52:40
Challenging pessimism and building optimism • One study found that even naturally pessimistic people who spent one week doing exercises in which they identified and wrote down times in the past in which they were at their best, their personal strengths, expressing gratitude to someone they have never properly thanked, and writing down three good things that happened were happier when their happiness levels were measured six months later. Seligman, M., Sterm, T., Park, N & Peterson, C. (2005) "Positive Psychology progress: Empirical validation of interventions," American Psychologist, 60: 410-421. • Seligman reports a study done by himself and Jeff Levy with people who scored as severely depressed in a depression inventory. Participants were instructed to recall and write down three good things that happened each day for 15 days. 94% of them went from severely depressed to mildly to moderately depressed during that time. Cited in Authentic Happiness, Seligman, Martin E.P., 2002. NY: Free Press. 

00:52:45
BILL O'HANLON So there's some research on this. Uhm, in passive psychology, they just found with Seligman is here. He's gonna give the last, ah, address I think of this conference, did a study with people who are severely depressed and he found by reorienting their attention to three things they were grateful for in the past or, uhm, you know doing, ah, ex-- ah, doing, uhm, write down times in the past when they were at their best. Their personal strengths, expressing gratitude to someone they have been express. He did random assignments to really severely depressed people. They had them do this for, uhm, a week and, uhm, they went back six months later and they happiness levels where greater. The depressed people, and they came out of severe depression into moderate depression, 94% of them went from severely depressed to mildly to moderately depressed after 15 days of doing this exercise. So you think that seems so unrealistic. My depressed clients, patients would never do this. They won't be able to rethink of these things. Well, they have do this and reorienting their attention, changing the viewing was, if I can get my really severely depressed people to mildly and moderately depressed, we make a lot faster progress in the therapy. I can tell you that cuz when they're so depressed, it's hardly get them to do almost anything. So I can get them a little detraction out of the depression. That's good enough for me and that's what this research is Seligman may speak about this but he wrote about in Authentic Happiness, right.

#3: Shifting relationship to depression 

00:54:15
BILL O'HANLON So the next one, the next strategy of the six-- do we need to take a break or you just wanna like take breaks on your own? What do you think? Keep going and take a break, okay. Well, how many people that we'd be better if, ah, we took it like a 10, 15 minute break? That be better cuz this is really hard to sit here. How many people just wanna keep going? Oh, men, that's a hard, ah, that's a hard one. Well, how about if I promise not to say anything important you still about to the bathroom. How's that it say? It all be fluff next session. No, no, I'm just joking. So can you just take yourself a break, is that all right? And maybe, and maybe how about if we just stand and place this stretch cuz I've been down there, it's like, let's do it a quick stretch break and if you really need to go to the bathroom run. All right, just-- it's hard to sit on those chairs. When I'm down there, I'm thinking why don't they take a break. When I'm up here, I'm thinking, I got so much to say. I don't wanna take a break, you know. All right, good and if this is your chance that you need to go and see somebody else, I won't be insulted. All right, let's all back down or it's gonna turn into a real break. All right. All right. All right, please sit down. Thank you. We'll start again. Thank you for that and I'm sorry for the people that really wanted to take a break. I apologize for that but I, I have a lot of materials and I really like to get through it and maybe get a few questions. Okay, so here we go. The third strategy is to shift your relationship to depression and I'm gonna give you a couple of ways to do this. There's some good research on some of this stuff and some of this just clinical strategy that I've come up with. 

00:56:10
#3: Shifting relationship to depression • Mindfulness: Noticing without judging and noticing variations in sensations, feeling, feeling, thoughts and experiences around depression • Externalizing: From domination and intrusion to taking back power from depression • Valuing depression: Stop resisting depression to reduce the suffering • Follow your wound: Making meaning and finding direction from the crisis and pain of depression 

00:56:10
BILL O'HANLON All right, so let me give you the list of what we're gonna cover and again, I-- there's a lot more details we can cover if we had a lot more time. I sometimes do this. This is a two or three-day workshop and I'm reading a whole book as I said. The, they may surprise you, there is good research that helping people to be mindful of their depression can alleviate their depression and even prevent relapses so that a recurrences. There's good research, pretty good, ah, designed research. Uhm, some of you know the narrative approach to therapy and they had good results by technique called externalizing and I'm gonna talk about two kinds of externalizing. Both that narrative therapy technique and the one I learned from Erickson and the Ericksonian approach which is a physical externalizing of depression. And so we'll talk about those and that we'll talk about valuing depression. You know, it seems such an, ah, unremittingly terrible thing that that's an interesting thing to say but I'll make my case for it and again not trivala-- trivialize the suffering because I think the suffering is pretty terrible, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Well, maybe I'd wish it on to some people but, uhm, most people I wouldn't wish it on and, uhm, you know, when I gonna talking about this following-- follow your wound by making meaning post depression and I think that certainly would happen for me. I, I wouldn't recommend depression to anybody but I would not give up having hand experience to depression in me, a better therapist, a kinder human being or sensitive to people and it lead to my life career. So you know, that's I'm gonna make a case for how that's possible that it just didn't have this devastating suffering and no meaning from and then no aftermath that could be valuable. 

00:58:00

00:58:00
BILL O'HANLON So let's talk about the mindfulness stuff first. Uhm, mindfulness, you know, there's a lot of definitions of it but my understanding of it having a study Buddhism for a while and knowing people who are quite expert in this is just noticing what's happening without judging. And one of the things that happens with depression is people get down on themselves. I shouldn't feel this way. It's bad to feel this way or this is a bad experience. I hate this feeling. They have judgment. They're trying to get rid of it. They're trying to fix it and noticing variations in sensations is part, and feeling, and thoughts, and experiences around depression. Part of mindfulness is noticing what's changing and most people that are depressed, think it's a unitary. This is just my depression. This is the way it is. It waxes and wanes. It changes. Body sensation is change, thoughts change, and people don't notice that sometimes because they think of it as a thing. I have depression and witnessing rather than getting caught up with or being with the experience in depression rather than trying to fix get rid of it, get out of it, sometimes the more you're trying to get out, the more the suffering increases. So we'll-- well, we'll show this in the research here and getting curious about it. Like, you know, what is this stuff, this experience, depression, rather than again trying to stand against it, stay with it off, get rid of it, kill it off. That this is the mindfulness that we're hearing so much about. It's come to the foreground in western society and in psychotherapy in recent years. Uhm, so some of the main researcher is a guy name Teasdale, uhm, who has done some of the control research on this and they call this approach, it's-- they call it-- and here is the main, ah, book they've written about. The first main book they wrote about The Mindful Way Through Depression: Freeing yourself from chronic unhappiness published by Guilford in 2007. Ah, so Zindel Segal, Jon Kabat-Zinn, uhm, Teasdale, and Williams, a guy from the UK, and they call it Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy.

Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MCBT) • MBCT proved as effective as maintenance anti-depressants in preventing a relapse and more effective in enhancing peoples' quality of life. The study also showed MBCT to be as cost-effective as prescription drugs in helping people with a history of depression stay well in the longer-term. • Over the 15 months after the trial, 47% of the group following the MBCT course experienced a relapse compared with 60% of those continuing their normal treatment, including anti-depressant drugs. In addition, the group on the MBCT programme reported a higher quality of life, in terms of their overall enjoyment of daily living and physical well-being. Kuyken, Willem, et. al. (2008). "Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy to Prevent Relapse in Recurrent Depression," Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, December; 76, (6): 966-978. 

01:00:05
BILL O'HANLON All right and so they, of course, go into initials. Anytime you wanna sell your therapy, you can put it into initials. Ah, MBCT and they have pretty good research. It's proved as effective as, ah, maintenance anti-depressants in preventing a relapse and more effective in enhancing peoples' quality of life, post depression. Uhm, it's cost as effe-- as cost-effective as prescription drugs, ah, in helping people with a history of depression stay well in the longer-term. So even, if they use medication, if you teach them, uhm, mindfulness based cognitive therapy methods for depression, it seems to work better and obviously a few less side effects on medication. Ah, over the 15 months after the trial, they did a major trial, they did, ah, this control research, 47% of the group following the, ah, mindfulness based cognitive therapy course experienced a relapse compared with 60% of those continuing their normal treatment, including anti-depressant drugs. In addition, the group on the MBCT program reported a higher quality of life, in terms of their overall enjoyment of daily living and physical well-being. So again, I've given this, uhm, resources and you go explore more if you want.

01:01:15
BILL O'HANLON Uhm, there are bunch of other studies and again, when you get this slide, you can go and look at this research but it pretty good quality research. They really took care to do some con-- first correlational and policy studies and good correlation or good, uhm, good experimental design, I think. 

01:01:30
Externalizing • Help people separate depression from their identity • Speak about depression as an undermining • Investigate times when depression has dominated • Investigate times when they have escaped from or stood up to depression • Build on those exceptions to uncover personal qualities and identity stories that show the person to be a hero and competent • Spread the story socially and extend it into the past and the future 

01:01:30
BILL O'HANLON Uhm, externalizing. Narrative therapy, by this approach, I came across in the late 80s and I met the, the, ah, proponents of, ah, uhm, a guy name Michael White who's no longer with us, who was part of this conference, ah, several times, and an Australian guy social worker and, ah, David Epstein, a Canadian, now living in New Zealand social worker. And, uhm, they have this idea that it's, that it's very highfalutin idea that came from Foucault that the history, if you read Foucault history of, uhm, psychiatric disorders. He was a social historian. He said, "First we started with the idea that when people had behavioral and emotional disturbances and psychological disturbances, it was caused by the guys," so I was outside of it. "And then, it was cause by their temperament or their humors in their blood." Right, start to go inside people and they found that with, ah, Foucault found, the more we internalize the idea of the cause of mental illness to the insides, now it's probably a broken vein or whatever, uhm, or partly genetics the more we marginalize people. That is they found that they're used to be the town crazy or fool and then we've made a silence and we put them at the edge of town. And in Europe, they even put people on ships. They would call the ships of fools, thinking that taking-- they were taking a voyage to insanity where you put of bunch of people, they didn't know how to sail a ship that were essentially having psychotic experience that didn't go well. Uhm, and, you know, no way to get food and everything. They put them on ships and send away. Those will call the ship of fool. So you were trying to marginalize those crazy people cuz we don't want to be part our society. And so they said that's an impressive experience and let's start to externalize troubles so that we can start to welcome people back into the community that was there political and social justice goal. So that was like their psychi-- psychological and psychotherapy goal and they came over this technique called externalizing where they would use the language to invite the person not to consider their troubles as part of them. Instead of saying, tell me about your depression, that's an internalizing question, they would say, when depression comes to visit, what does it tell you about yourself? Are there any times you ever have stood up to depression and said, "I don't believe that about myself." or do you always believe what depression is telling you? I had a client who sad, when we start to talk this way and he said, you know, "My depression, I'm depressed. My depression, my depressive personality," and I started, I use this externalizing language and he told me that when he'd-- had the experience to depression, he'd never went to his bedroom. He just stayed on his couch and he would eat-- he was used to be on the health and fitness and he would now just order pizzas to go. They would deliver it to his apartment and he stop going to work. He work for himself. He stop working and he would just lay in the couch, kinda getting, you know, slug-like in the far shaking down himself cuz now he's gaining weight. You know, he's really bad and I said, "So, you know, when depression moved in, it kick you out of your bedroom and, and sentence you, you've stay on the couch." He said, "Yeah, I never thought of it that way." And I said, you know, "So what would it take for you to kick out your bad roommate depression so you could moved back into the bedroom and have a normal life again?" And we start talking that way and he said, "You know, I have to call friends. I have to working out again. I have to stop ordering pizza and eat a little healthier food." You know, he had all this way that he could kinda get back to the bedroom and kick out it's like he invited someone each day who'd taken over his life. You know, it's like a bad movie with Bill Murray or something and, you know, he wanted to find strategies than to kick this guy out, his unwanted roommate from his apartment. That's a much different sense of depression than it's in my genes, in my blood, in my humors and as part of my personality. So that gives you sometimes a little distant and a little leeway with the depression. So this is externalizing and there are bunch of steps to it, uhm, helping people separate depression from their identity, speak about depression as an undermining influence, investigate time when depression has dominate their lives, and then find those exceptions when they have escaped from the domination of it. Start to build on those exceptions, undercover heroic or healthy personal qualities that could stand against the influence of depression and then spread a new story to them, to the people in their environment. Spread the story into the past and into the future. This it the quick course in narrative therapy which you should spend about six months or a year or two-year studying but I like to give you the clip notes on the Reader's Digest version. 

01:06:15
Valuing depression • Stop resisting depression to reduce the suffering 

01:06:20
BILL O'HANLON Uhm, okay, so another strategy with this to value depression. To-- well, let me just give you one-- ah, another example. Uhm, Jeff Sych, who is the organizer of this conference, once told me a story about, ah, ah, patient that he had and, uhm, this is a woman who is really depressed and again, Jeff was working with her and he wasn't willing very well. And finally, Jeff suggested to her, "What I like you to do is go get the, the biggest rock you can possibly carry around in your purse as be really big and really heavy." So she found one and he said, "I want to spray-- paint it black and I want you to carry it around in your purse for the next week." And she's like, you know, walking around with this thing and finally, finally on the other week so they go, okay, "Now go find a place that's meaningful for you to leave that rock." And her depression start to lift, she had him viewed that rock with the heaviness of the feeling that she had and that's a different kind of externalization. That's a physical externalization of depression. So there's a whole literature Ronald Vanderhorst is not here, a friend of Bessel van der Kolk is actually from, ah, Holland has a whole book about rituals in psychotherapy that include some of this physical metaphor or rituals. I think that's a nice strategy as well. Uhm, so valuing depression, stop resisting depression. This is the Buddhist approach, you know. It's just the more you resist it the worse it gets basically, it's the idea. Whatever your resist either increases a suffering or persist more. 

01:07:50
Follow Your Wound • Depression can be a spur to a new life direction 

01:07:55
BILL O'HANLON So I talk about this as what happen for me, I call it you know, Joseph Campbell, years ago said, uhm, said this quotation when Bill Morris was interviewing him on public television, you know on this myth program, The Power of Myth, ah, he said, "You know, if you had a student that came to you and one of them didn't know how to live their life. What would you say to him?" And Joseph Campbell said, "I'd say follow your bliss. You know, that life will work out if you follow your bliss," so that became, ah, a little big saying. I live in Santa Fe and we have a little bumper stickers, you're following my bliss, you know. Uhm, and Joseph Campbell regretted that after I said, "You know, people-- we've realize that and they were, you know, like do what feels good." That is what I meant by following your bliss. I meant really your soul is calling this deep calling. It doesn't always feel good to follow your bliss. You know it's hard sometimes to takes you on dangerous and tough paths. He said, "Maybe, I should have said follow your blisters instead. That would've a little better and that's what I mean by this. Like, again, you know, the hundred times in the (inaudible ) journalist that I hate to recommend sex drugs and rock and roll but they always work for me and mys-- my variation to that saying is I hate to recommend having a major breakdown but it always work for me as of growth experience. And I bet this work for a few of you but for me that depression led to my curiosity about the human mind, human relationships lead me then to become a therapist. When I became a therapist, I got so pissed off on the discouraging nature of psychotherapy and how it's so focused on pathology. I went on to write 36 books to try and fix it. I'm up there on the stage because of my depression. So again, when to recommend people painful experience to go through, I almost died from it but if you can come out of it and find a way to turn it in this a life direction and meaning and be more sensitive to the suffering of other people, be more committed to helping other people not go there or recover from it that is pretty good stuff. 

01:09:50
Pissed and Dissed as Life Energies and Guides to Life Directions • Pissed as a clue for what to do with the rest of your life • Dissed as a clue for what to do with the rest of your life 

01:09:50
BILL O'HANLON That's when you can mind the meaning the value from depression so that's one thing to do and I think there are two energies that our clients usually come with when they're depressed and I call them pissed and dissed. You know their energy, you know, there's the bliss energy and that's a nice energy but most of our clients don't come in bliss. They come in and they've been dissed, disrespected, wounded, dissatisfied, or they come in angry and pissed and I think you can mind those to as guides for life direction. You know, I was pissed so I wrote a bunch of books and became a psychotherapy presenter and it came right out of that and about the first 17 books then I calm down a little and then I learn to write. I had other thing to say but, uhm, dissed was where have you been disrespected by life by other people, where you have been wounded. Can you take, you know, the cheap thing that they say about, so you've heard this I'm sure most of you, you know, oh, you only became a psychotherapist because you're all messed up and you wanted to fix your family or fix yourself. And I say, "Yes, of course, but the more new one's way of saying that is I became a psychotherapist because I was the sensitive one in my family and I was sensitive to the stuff that other people either notice or pay for it over o r whatever it maybe and I wanted to prevent the suffering of other people like I suffered. And I think a lot of you where in that situation. Some of you grow up in normal or functional family. I don't know what you're doing as therapist but whatever. Uhm, you know, uhm, I think that we who have been wounded and suffered become more sensitive to the suffering of others and if we can come out of that, obviously, it's not great to just stay there if you can come out of that and bring that sensitivity to the healing of other people of the classic wounded healer kind off, uhm, archetype and turned it into something good that's when depression can actually be possibly valuable even though it's weird to say depression could be valuable cuz it's just tough stuff as I was talking earlier right? 

01:11:55
Disrespected: Wounded/Cursed or Dissatisfied: Righteously Indignant/ Dissatisfied 

01:11:55
BILL O'HANLON So let me give you an example to this. Let me see if I can get them to come on. Uhm, so again, ah, you know, it's this, in two ways, this is what I mean by this, wounded or cursed or dissatisfied, righteously indignant and, you know, dissatisfied with the current state of affairs. 

01:12:10
Transforming the "negative" energy of anger and hurts into positive energy 

01:12:10
BILL O'HANLON Uhm, they key though is not just to have it be terrible but to transform this negative stuff pissed or dissed into positive energy that contributes in some way. 

01:12:20
Disrespected: Wounded/Cursed Patsy Rodenberg Voice coach for actors and public speakers 

01:12:25
BILL O'HANLON Uhm, so let me, again, so this one became a vocal coach. She helps people find their voice. She was electively mot-- mute for two years during her childhood because she was made so much fun of and so brutalize by this woman who was assigned to help her overcome her speech impediment. And I think that's a perfect example of finding your wound and then turning it to a life direction. 

01:12:45
Leonard Cohen: There's a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in. 

01:12:50
BILL O'HANLON You know, uhm, I think Cohen says, "There's a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in." It's from Anthem, write his poem in song. 

01:12:55
Ann Rice- A wound transformed Daughter who died of leukemia at 5. Rice wrote a novel that featured a 5-year-old who could never die. (Interview with a vampire) 

01:13:00
BILL O'HANLON Ann Rice, a novelist had a daughter who died of leukemia at 5 years old and she sank into a deep depression. And she had time off work, she was legal assistant, and she had time off work and when her compassionate leave was up, her husband look at her and said, "You had no shape to go back to work. Yeah, you're still grieving. You're still depressed and, you know, you've always want to write a book why don't you just stay home and we'll make do somehow without the extra income and write your book." And she immediately began working on the book that later became Interview with a Vampire and she put a 5-year-old character in there, if you ever read the book or seen the movie, who could never die. And she in viewed that character with the qualities of her daughter because she was terribly afraid that she would forget what her daughter was like and that was her way of dealing with depressive grief that she was going through. It's externalizing in certain way but to use this sort of life direction and obviously, you know, she went on to have quite a career as a novelist. That was the first impulse to write if you will.

Sam Keen - Wounds as invitations to healing self and others We all leave childhood with wounds. In time we may transform our liabilities into gifts. The faults that pockmark the psyche may become the source of a man or a woman's beauty. The injuries we have suffered invite us to assume the most human of all vocations - to heal ourselves and others. - Sam Keen 

01:14:10
BILL O'HANLON Sam Keen, the former-- the editor of psychology today says it this way, " We all leave childhood with wounds. In time we may transform our liabilities into gifts. The faults that pockmark the psyche may become the source of a man or a woman's beauty. The injuries we have suffered invite us to assume the most human of all vocations - to heal ourselves and others."

I thank God for my handicaps, for through them I have found myself, my work and my God. - Helen Keller Real suffering burns clean; neurotic suffering creates more and more soot. - Marion Woodman 

01:14:35
BILL O'HANLON Now, Helen Keller says, "I thank God for my handicaps, for through them I have found myself, my work and my God." And, ah, Jungian analyst, Marion Woodman says, "Real suffering burns clean; neurotic suffering creates more and more soot." And I think somebody has been through such a severe depression that's real suffering. And if they can come through that, sometimes it forges them into a different kind of person. 

01:15:00
Assessment of the wound • Where have you been wounded • Where or about what have you been accused? • What would you like to change about the world or other people? • What would you talk about if given an hour of prime time television to influence the nation or the world? • How can you turn this wound or disrespect or curse into a blessing or contribution? 

01:15:00
BILL O'HANLON So, you know, the question I always have is where have you been wounded? Where or about what have you been accused? What would you like to change about the world or other people? What would you talk about if given an hour of prime time television to influence the nation or the world? Some of you know is this-- since I ask a question, some of you know exactly what you're talking about. That's your life mission. If you're not doing that, I think that's a good idea to start considering, how can you turn this wound or disrespect or curse into a blessing or contribution. That's the question here. 

01:15:30
The Possible Value of Depression • Evolutionary Psychologists have speculated that depression might serve some survival function for the individual or the group • Perhaps helping people get realistic and give up positive illusions; perhaps helps them change course when some direction or effort is not working; might help them connect with others and help social cohesion • Ruminating can help maintain a focus on problem solving and think more clearly See How Sadness Survived and Schwarz, N., and Bless, H. (1991), "Happy and mindless, but sad and smart? The impact of affective states on analytic reasoning." In J.P. Forgas (Ed.), Emotion and social judgments (pp.55-71), Elmsford, NY: Pergamon Press 

01:15:30
BILL O'HANLON Now, evolutionary psychologist, this one doesn't sit well with me but I just started mention it in this category. They said, "Why do 10% of the world's population all over the place get depressed? What possible evolutionary value could depression have?" So they've tried to speculate, I don't know what they gotten that far but basically, there's a few research studies that show that there might be some value to depression that most of us are wearing rose colored glass and wear kind of psychotically delusionary optimistic. And the depressed people actually see the world a little more like it is. Little more realistically. So there maybe, there's a value in populations have somebody who sees, you know, like, yeah, global warming really could happen. No, we hav-- the scientist also figure that, we don't have to worry about that, the rest of us say or we're busy with our everyday life. The depressed people are brooding on that, thinking, yeah, we're all gonna die.

BILL O'HANLON And so, you know, it might be-- it seems to be that people-- they did experiments and they found that people who are depressed thought more deeply and more realistically about problems that the rest of us sort to skip over the surface sometimes so for the most us-- for the most analysis and problem solving by focusing attention in the problem and reducing distractibility cuz depressed people tend to ruminate on what the problem is. It doesn't really do it for me but I just thought I've mention it to you that maybe someday we'll figure out what the point of this is, uhm, and why it might possibly be a value to the human race.

Depression can help social cooperation and decision making Happy or secure participants showed shorter decision times and imitated others' behavior, whereas sad or insecure participants exhibited more systematic and rational behavior.

The 3 Cs • Connection • Compassion • Contribution 

01:17:05
BILL O'HANLON Sorry, I'll give you the introduction to this and probably just turn it down a little. Ah, this Andrew Solomon again and he's still talking with Terry Gross and Terry Gross is asking him, you know, like what do you-- he said, "You know, I think once you've come out in depression, there's some value to it." She's like, "What did you bring a value?" So he said, "You know, I, you know, again, I was-- I think once you come out of depression, you can find that it's change you as a person." She said, "How did it change you?" He said, "Ah, that I'm kinder and I have a joy in everyday life. You know, I'm not depressed then I realized that every moment cuz I went so devastating." And I've done some study and some thinking and some writing about what I've call post depression thriving. Like what actually makes the difference between just being wounded by that terrible experience in depression and being writer if we're going back there and actually thriving in the wake of it and I think he mention a couple of things and I'm gonna give you another, ah, example pretty quick. But I think if you can make deeper connection to yourself, through the depression which I certainly did to myself. I didn't know myself very well, and I spent a lot of time thinking about my life and then with others. Like my friends saved my life and then I learned better how to connect other people and not be so isolated and lonely and if you can connect to the bigger meaning. If you want, if you wanna call it spiritually of God that's great. For me, it was life purpose that are connecting me to and that helped in this post depression thriving. The second he said, "I became a kinder person." If you can become more compassionate to yourself and others in the you kept depression, I think you can start to develop this post depression thriving. And the last one is can you find a way to make a contribution. My depression lead me to write 36 books, if you will, and trying to contribute to those lessening of suffering in the world in the more effective approach to the psychotherapy so, uhm, you know, I've done some thinking about this and we'll give, ah, another example of this in a couple of minutes when I give you one more, ah, audio. 

01:19:10
#4 Challenging isolation • Depression invites people to isolation and disconnection • Connections as essential healing and preventive factors 

01:19:10
BILL O'HANLON But, let's go into the fourth one cuz we gotta get to the sixth one. Eventually, we had to cover six of these so we'll pretty much on track and we'll pry up time for a couple of questions. Depression invites people to isolation and disconnection. I think most emotional psychological disturbances invite people to isolate and be, you know, either people shun them or they pull away from people. In depression both, if, if you ever live with somebody who's depressed, you know, despite your best intentions, it's really hard to connect with it. They don't want they feel like burden on you often. They push you away, they push you away with their behavior. They pull away because they're so hard to be around people or nothing, you know, they can't make the effort to even be civil or, you know, it's an isolating problem. It pulls you, it pushes you away from other people and we know because of the way we evolved is in groups. You know, from the, you know, primates and then into the humans, the ones that get push to the side, they die. You know, the ones that they, they tried to leaves behind. They don't survive very well. It's stressful to be alone. Stress hormones get release when you're alone, when you're lonely. It's not a good thing and depression has some correlation with stress so, so, there you go, I'm connecting. Uhm, so let me give you an example of this so Andrew Solomon, I mention to, ah, is, is this interview that I sort of playing that the treating that goes through this. He travel all around the world and someone told me he ought to Cambodia. There's a woman there who's treating depression in the most unusual way. In the wake of the Pol Pot Killing Fields that, you know, that they slaughtered half of the country and anybody who wore glasses was instantly killed because they were intellectual kind of weird stuff like. You know, they did some of those atrocity where they've raped people. They make them raped people in front of them. They raped their children, different terrible stuff happened, and mass, mass murder, genocide by Pol Pot and the regime. And, uhm, this woman who's also lost her children, relatives, and husband, and, you know, had seen terrible devastation, arrives at the refugee camp after it starts to come down. And she sees these women sitting next to here who are so depressed. They've just had a baby and they won't feed their baby. The baby is crying next to them. They can't even pick them up and feed them. And she's like, she goes to the camp organizer and say, "Look, nobody is treating these women. They're severely depressed. You need to have a program." And they go, "We don't have the money. We don't have the resources." She goes, "Okay, I'm starting a program, is that okay?" And the go, "Yeah, great, go for it." She's just a Cambodian woman who just starts this program but she comes up with something that works. 

01:21:50
Social Isolation is Becoming More Common Social connections are at risk in a modern societies • Shared family dinners and family vacations are down over a third in the last 25 years • Having friends over to the house is down by 45% over the last 25 years • Participation in clubs and civic organizations is down by over 50% in the last 25 years • Church attendance is down by about a third since the 1960s • The average number of people we consider close confidants dropped nearly one-third, from 2.94 in 1985 to 2.09 in 2004 • The average American has only two close friends • 1 in 4 American (25%) report that they have no one to confide in • Average household size has decreased by about 10% during the past twenty years, to 2.5 people • In 1990, more than 1 in 5 households were headed by a single parent: currently it is 1 in 3 • 6.27 million people in the U.S. live alone and that is expected to increase to 29 million by 2010 • People with five or more close friends (excluding family members) are 50 percent more likely to describe themselves as "very happy" than respondents with fewer 

01:21:50
BILL O'HANLON So let's hear about it. So the trend as that Robert Putnam of Bowling Loan-- ah, the author of Bowling Loan as psycho-- sociologist and he has all these researches, shared family, dinners and f family vacations are down over a third of the last 25 years. Having friends over the house is down by 45% over the last 25 years. Participation in clubs and civic organizations is down by 50% in the last 25 years. Church attendance is down by a third since the '60s. The average number of people we consider close confidants dropped nearly one-third, form 2.94 in '85 to 2.09 in 2004. Average American has only two close friends. One of four Americans report they have no one to confide in. Ah, average household size has decreased by 10% the last 25 years. This, this, ah, trend line change a little during the recession but not that much. In 1990, more than one in five households were headed by a single parent currently is one in three. 6.27, uhm, million this was written a while ago, people in the U.S. live alone that's expected increase by-- to 29 million by 2010. People with five or more close friends excluding family members reported their 50% more happy and describe themselves you know, as more happy than responses with fewer than five, ah, close friends that aren't family members and people are having less friends. Social isolation is just becoming more and more common and it turns out that you know, that as they say is stressful. It's physically stressful. Their stress hormones release when you're isolate, when you're lonely and when you're not connected to people. 

01:23:25
Seven pathways to connection • Inner self; deep self: heart: soul: intuition • Body: physical self and sensations • Another being • Others; group; community • Art • Nature • Bigger meaning/purpose; God/higher power 

01:23:25
BILL O'HANLON So I think there are seven pathways of connections that are endanger these days and that you often find with people that are depressed that there are afraid connections in some of these. So one of the things that I do is I assess where are the connections, where are the disconnections, where can we strengthen their connection not just the social ones but the personal one. Some people are disconnect from themselves. They don't have a clue what's going on with them. We see those people to therapy. You know, I have a, a couple one time and the, the guy had an affair then they got back together after being separated for a year and then he got the flu one week and or cold or something and it is-- he was acting like he did when he was having affair which was really distant and his wife got really worried and she said, you know, he's-- she can't bug him. "What's going on with you? What's going on with you?" He couldn't answer first of all he's a little sick. Second of all, he had no insight of what's going on to him. He said, "I'm the last person to know what's going with me." She usually knows what's going on long before I know what's going on." And I thought that was such a great. I've seen them in thousands of men that I worked with. They're the last person to know what's going on, and so I think sometimes were isolated from ourselves and sometimes women are so concern with taking care of others they don't attend to themselves. So they are, you know, they are various kind of-- I think risk with that when people are depressed are often-- I'll touch with themselves and if they have that post-depression thriving, they sometimes learn to know each other, ah, and themselves in a new way connect with themselves. Sometimes we're disconnecting from our bodies without taking care of our bodies, our physical self or sensations, this whole movement towards, mindfulness, I think is good, you know because it starting to get us back to paying attention to our experience and being connected with it. Connecting with another being right because we're so isolated. Ah, I used to say another person, tell other client who the only connection she had was her dog. The only reason she didn't kill herself is wasn't gonna leave that dog cuz nobody else would love it and care for it like she did and that was her only connection. She was disconnect from herself, disconnect from other people, no meaning in her life, no purpose, no high, no religion or anything spirituality, and that was her connection. And then we built on that once she had that connection and try to make some other connections. Then there's a more social connection not just to one person or one animal but to a group in the community and that suffers a lot in modern society as we just found out. Connection through art, creativity. Some expression either that you get from other people because you consume their art or you create yourself and I think we often see some reconnection through the artistic process. And then connect in the nature where, you know, there's all these books nature deficits disorder, you know that that's a new, ah, thing they are trying to propose because there seems to be some need to connect to nature in some way and we spend a lot of time in this kind of rooms, right, at work, ah, you know, at workshops. Things like that. And then, the last one is connecting to something bigger. Bigger meaning and purpose or God or higher power. So the first two, our self connections, the next two are interpersonal or social connections, and the last four, I would call transpersonal. They're beyond people connections. So I think a lot of the people that I've seen get disconnected in some way and I, and you'll often find they're disconnected in a lot of these areas. So here's a little research by, uhm, in psychology research about a researcher, about the connections to nature and the healing effects of the connection to the nature this is done, there's a pad-- bad quality video. I took it after a website of the university so it's a little, uhm, shaky and-- but I thought it's so funny. They put a plant behind them to, you know, like make a connection in it. 

01:27:00
#5 A Future With Possibilities • Connecting to a future with meaning and hope • Often in depression, there is a collapse of future-mindedness and hope •We can help reconnect the person with future possibilities 

01:27:05
BILL O'HANLON I've-- we'll move through this one pretty quickly and get to number six and, and I'll have some time for questions. A future with possibilities. Now, if you're here at the beginning and somebody wanted it in a little late, you remember the story I told about what happened for me. I was suicidal, depressed, and then a friend said, "You can go live in the farmhouse in the future when my aunts die." That pulled me, started to pull me out of, and I call this future pull. If you have a future to live into, you can sometimes live through a lot of stuff and I think depression is one of those things. It's hard to live through. It's hard to, you know, so do you have a future with possibilities? As soon as I had that future with possibility of that one who is suicidal one. I'm so depressed that alleviate the depression a little just to have that hope, that sense of hope for the future. So, you know, often in depression, I think, there is a collapse of future-mindedness and hope. It's part of the par-- parcels of some of the bleakness that goes a long with it and we can help connect the future, the person with future possibilities. 

01:28:10
Future Pull • Victor Frankl • The farmhouse in my future 

01:28:10
BILL O'HANLON You know that, ah, Victor Frankl had a great example of this when he's almost killed during the his fourth, uhm, imprisonment in the-- during the World War II by the Nazis and he almost dies one day and he has this vision of himself giving a lecture in post-war Vienna and that pulls him through this terrible mo-- when he almost gave so that I can't go on anymore. This is too much. And, you know, so he, he told that story at the Evolution of Psychotherapy in 1990. I was thinking in the front row and he talks about he was envisioning himself giving a lecture in post-war Vienna to 200 people and when I saw he gave a lecture to 7,000 people and they gave him standing ovation. So he live into that future through the terrible trauma that he went through and when he said that I thought, "Well, that's what happen to me with the farmhouse." I had a future to live into that I had to go meet and I just had to hold on by my fingernails till I could get to the future and then I-- on the way to that farmhouse future I found another future that was worth living into which is me standing here. 

01:29:15
Future Pull • Problems into preferences • Positive expectancy language • Letter from one's future • Starting therapy from post-depression perspective 

01:29:15
BILL O'HANLON Right, so there are techniques not all of us are Victor Frankl, let's just say that and so we can always do it so well. Our clients, if they find it hard when they're depressed to connect to a future with possibilities. So I've come up with some techniques and the one that again I was influence by Erickson because he used a lot of these language methods that pre-suppose things like how quickly will you go into a trance? He has to say, "Will you go into trance?" How quickly, that's all we're talking about. Now, so he would pre-supposed things and I learned to use his language based so I'll give you two of them really quickly that I think you can use with any client who is depressed and it's like language with the virus. They start to get infected with the virus of hope. So the first one is sort to Carl Rogers with a twist. Instead of just reflecting what people tell you when they tell you something bad, they usually complain about the past, the painful past or the troublesome present. This method reflects what they've said to validate what they've said but puts it into the future and turns it from a problem into a preference. So if the person says, "I have no energy. I can't get out of bed." I say, "So you really, in the work, we do here, you really like to be able, to be able to get out of bed a little more quickly and have more energy." And they nod as if I just repeated what they've said but I haven't repeated what they've said. I've twisted it into a future with possibilities. If they say, you know, "I feel like such a burden on everybody. I just don't wanna talk to anybody or have anybody around me." I might say in response to that, "So you like to get into the place where you won't feel like you're such a burden and where you can connect a little better with the people who care for you." Now, again that if they nod, you validated what they've said and you reflected it but I've reflected it with the twist so I take it from the past and what they don't want into the future and what they would want. Now I'm just guessing but if you know the person, you're gonna have a pretty good guess and is usually opposite of whatever they're complaining about. You know, like, you know, I had a terrible childhood and I want my kids to have the same kind of childhood that I had so one of the things is you wanna get better because you wanna make sure that you-- your kids don't have the same kind of troublesome experience you had and they go, "Yeah, that's right." Now they're oriented to the future not the past, not the present, you know, which is troublesome but the future and that's a small way of doing that Victor Frankl or me in the farmhouse in the future. It's a very small reorientation from everything stuck in bad here to there was a possibility and hope out there, that's the first method. The second method is related to that and it's positive expectancy language. After you come out of this depression, I might ask as part of my assessment, when you're feeling more energy, before we get into how to help you get over this depression, before you start to feel better, I wanna ask you a little about how you've been feeling. And you hear all those, what are they pre-suppose, persons getting it better someday, sometime. We plant the seed of hope with the language. I said instead, the next time you're depressed, I want you to, that plants the seed for the next depression. If I were gonna talk about, I'd say, "If you ever get depressed again, how do you think you'll be able to prevent yourself from growing as low as you went this last time." Well, that's a seeding of the future possibility. So if I'm talking about a negative is gonna happen to the future, I'll use the conditional if. When I'm talking about the stuff that we wanna have happen, I'll use the more certainty when, after, before, so that's this positive expectancy language that I see through my, through my assessment. When I first start to ask him about their situation, I'm already talking about the future filled with hope, right. Another technique is sometimes I give people an assignment to write themselves a letter from the fut-- their future self when they come through depression and they're on the other side of it. You know, what is he or she thinking then? What is he or she doing then? What do you think he or she would say to you right now back to your present self who's suffering from depression? What would, ah, what would your future self say to you cuz you've gotten through it? It's a year from now, it's six months from now, it's five years from now, it's three months from now. What would your future self say to your present self? You know, don't be so hard into yourself, the future self might say or hang on, you'll get through this. These letters are so moving when they come in and read me that letters, I'm like crying. They're so compassionate and so kind, and so wise sometimes. Like tell your therapist to tell you this, you know, and then, I'm going like this, you know, how to, ah,-- thanks future self as my supervisor. I really like that, yeah. They have this kinda wisdom and kindness in their future self that reflects that kind of hope cuz they say, "I can't do it." You say, "Well, if you, you know, pretend doing as if, you don't have to be perfect." Starting therapy from post-depression perspective, you actually start that but it probably went by pretty quickly. I asked Elaine in that video, that brief video excerpt I'd showed you, I say, "When you're-- we're done with therapy and you were you wanna be, what will be happening?" "I almost always start on my therapy in the future." Like, went strange to start therapy in the past, tell me about where you came from or what are the influences on you? When did this start. I almost always start it in the future in resolution. Even when I asked that many of my clients go back and tell me about the past but now I planted the seed, when it's over we can-- I used to-- Virginia Contreras once say to a couple, "If we wave a magic wand and everything was better, what would your relation be like?" The solution focus folks have the miracle question which is on variation on that. Erickson used to have a technique that was call pseudo-orientation in time where he had people hallucinate during hypnosis everything, you know, their future in, you know, in an already result. He, he told me once, he said, "Sometimes, when I can't get anywhere with someone, I'll put him in trance. I'll have them hallu-- I'll do time," distortion is called, "time orientation change and I'll do future orientation. I'll have them say, 'Okay, time is changing.' It's a year after your therapy with me finished and we finished successful and you're back for a follow up visit. Tell me what did I do during therapy that was so helpful to you." And they would tell him all the great stuff he'd say and all the insights they had, and all the changes they'd made. Then he put him in trance and he get them-- he de-- he help him developed amnesia so they forget they told him that. They bring about the trance and do the therapy they told him to do and I was so amazed by that. And he said, "People have a blue print for how they gonna change even if they don't know they have that blue print." They have this kind of idea about how it's gonna happen and he could have listed it through the hypnotic process and Steve de Shazer once called me up, who's no longer with us, who created this miracle question, he said-- I said, "What do you up into?" And he said, "We've just created a question on our clinic that's Erickson sort to orientation in time the crystal ball technique without using trance. We just asked people if a miracle happen tonight, you woke up tomorrow and you were through with your problem. What would be happening? How would other people know?" And he said, "It's working just like the hypnosis Erickson talk about. People will tell their solutions as soon as you orient him to a future with hope and possibility." It's like, oh, wow, that's a really great thing. I went into my next session, try it, I feel flat, never work-- I never used it again but I have other ways of doing it because I learn them from other places and I developed myself but whenever ha-- whenever you can do this like that is orient people to experientially into a future with possibilities and hope because that's part of what's missing for most people who are depress can be really helpful.

#6 Restarting brain growth The neurogenic/neuroatrophy hypothesis and how to use it in treatment 

01:37:55
BILL O'HANLON Now, this is the one that I the most excited about, ah, because it's so new for me. I knew a lot of those from the other therapy trainings that's I've had. This one is so exciting to me. I am not one of these people who's a medication basher. I know this-- the name of this presentation is non-medication ways but it seems to me, if medications help people great I'm before it. I don't believe the stories they tell about medications. It's often, obviously, there are side effects sometimes but I was excited about this because it sort of encompasses medications but it goes beyond those. So this is call-- this, this number six category is called restarting brain growth and it comes from what we can call, well, there's more and more evidence for this hypothesis. Again, nobody knows what causes depression. Nobody know it's multifactoral-- fa-- factorial but this is called the neurogenic and neuroatrophy hypothesis and I'll tell you about it and I'll tell you how to use them in treatment. 

01:38:55
The New Brain Science • Old view: Brain had fixed structure and set number of brain cells, which declined over the aging process and with damage from trauma • New view: Brain plasticity • Brain can grow new cells and make new connections throughout life • Brain and body experience alters the structure and connections in the brain, strengthening, growing or weakening them and changing structure 

01:38:55
BILL O'HANLON So let's just take it like a step at time here. So you've heard a lot this new brain science stuff that's coming out. When I was in psychology school, that was a few years ago, carbon date me, they taught me that the brain was fixed after adolescence. It not-- worst than fixed, you lost brain function as time went on. No new br-- you were born with the certain amount, they developed the loose connections that happen up until you're adolescence, late adolescence maybe, a lot through infancy and childhood, and then it slowed down, and then you just deteriorated from their lost brain cells that was it. I had a health, ah, professor in, ah, since high school said, "Don't ride on motorcycle cuz you only have so many brain cells and that jiggle so much, you're gonna lose like millions, uhm, each motorcycle." Every time I ride on motorcycle, I don't know, I'm just thinking a little brain cells dying after that. But it turns out that was not right. It was just a belief and it turned out the belief wasn't true. It had-- the idea brain has fix structures and it set number of cells and it set number of connections and that's it. Now we know, you know, and it took a lot-- it was par-- ah, with those Thomas Kuhn, paradigm changes because the old neurologist fought against this. They massacred the people who published the first, you know, scientifically, who published the first study challenging this. You know, they did bird studies and then there was a guy who's father recovered from the massive stroke and he wrote about he grew new brain cells. He did, ah, he did an autopsy in his father own brain. He was a physician. After his father died and said there was brain growth in the areas that were damaged by stroke after he had a stroke and as the other scientist that's impossible. It's just not possible. Brains do not grow new cell after certain age. Well, now we know they do. That's the new brain, ah, idea of plasticity. There are two parts of this, brains can grow new cells and make new connection throughout life. There, so there's two parts. There's the connectivity part and the new brain cells. It turns out the hippocampus pumps up brain cells, new brains cells all through life except when it doesn't and when it doesn't, it's when it's under massive stress for a long time. First, brain cell growth slows and then it stops. They've examined brains like the DNA and stuff. They've examined brains where there's been untreated depression for a long time and they find lesions in the brain. Brain cells do grow-- die off, connectivity dies off if there's untreated of long term severe depression. So brain cells can, that's why I put, they can grow new cells and make new creativity throughout life. And brain and body experience alter the structure of the brain and connections in the brain, strengthening, or growing or weakening them and changing structure. They first found this in London cabbies. They have certain London cabbies in London, England who are called master cabbies and then order to be master cabby, not only they have to drive and do all the safety things, you have to memorize what called the London A through Z which is a street atlas. And if you ever in the London, there are some streets that are like 5 feet long. There are thousands of street in London and you have to be able to-- if they give you a quiz, you have to tell them where that street is. You know, and they'll chose really obscure ones, they're only a block long and in nowhere else in London. The y have to memorize those and those cabbies submitted themselves to brain imaging study and when they die they don't enter their brains to science and they found that the visual parts of their brain were radically expanding. Now these cabbies had learned to be master cabbies as adults so they knew that adults brains change structure. That's one of the first things they did with (inaudible ), ah, Mr. Nick(ph) who's, ah, here in California did some of the stuff and, uhm, there a lot of evidence start to a crew so the old paradigm clap, the new one said, "Things can change and they change through experience." All right, now I was-- I have a newsletter that I send out every month and I always recommend books sort of great videos of whatever and I have a newsletter reader who's one of my favorite reader. She always sends me recommendations for great videos and she's a great reader and she said, "You know in your net, last newsletter, you talk about this thing, I think you should read this book. It was great book. I just read it. It's Norman Doidge's The Brain That Changes Itself." And I read this book and, you know, she-- I-- her recommendation had been pretty good so I bought the book and I read it and, and that book stunned me. It was this adventure story of the discovery of neuroplasticity. Norman Doidge has became a friend of mine. He's really amazing fellow. This book is like a novel in how it reads. It's so well written and it really, you know, tells the story of the re-- or the discovery of brain plasticity and the neuroplasticity and, uhm, and the opposite which is neuroatrophy, that is if you do things to stress the brain or damage the brain, brain cells can die off, brain connectivity starts to weaken and they're trouble and so he's examined both side of it but it's mostly about neuroplasticity and I get to the end of this stuff and I just have to tell you a little about myself. I was a dedicated couch potato most of my adult life. All-- ah, my favorite sport are indoor sports. I like to read, I like to play music, I like to work on the computer, I like to talk to people. I was never an athletic kid, ah, when I was younger and then as an adult was blessed with the kind of a naturally thin body. I didn't need extras that much and I didn't, I didn't like it. You know, this is hard. It gets ready and it's hard. You know, it takes time and I was busy. I have four kids and I really-- and I never exercise. And I read this book and at the end of its pieces, people asked me what can you do the best thing for brain plasticity and neurogenesis to grow in your brain cells to exercise? And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, right. Okay." "Is there any vitamins you can take or something, you know?" 

01:45:05
Neurogenic/Neuroatrophy Hypothesis So far, the evidence for the theory is sketchy, but intriguing. Recent findings show a pattern that fits with the theory. Stress, which plays a key role in triggering depression, suppresses neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Antidepressants, on the other hand, encourage the birth of new brain cells. Animals must take antidepressants for two or three weeks before they bump up the birth rate of brain cells, and the cells take maybe another two weeks to start functioning. That's consistent with the lag time antidepressants show before they lift mood in people. If an antidepressant is given during a period of chronic stress, it prevents the decline in neurogenesis that normally occurs. 

01:45:05
BILL O'HANLON And I sort to ignore it and this hypothesis, let's get back to that, okay. So, here's the neurogenic neuroatrophy hypothesis. So far, the evidence is sketchy but it's, it's getting better. It's intriguing. Uhm, recent findings show a pattern that fits with the theory. Stress which plays a key role in triggering depression, suppresses neurogenesis in the, in the hippocampus. That's where your pumping out new brain cells when they pump out and when you get on to your chronic stress less and then none after awhile. Antidepressants, on the other hand, encourage the birth of new brain cells. There's other stuff on TV saying, "Oh, there's serotonin and they helps it," that's to-- you think that's true? I know you-- some of you do. You think it's true because you saw it on the commercials and the psychiatrist told you but it's not true. It's a hypothesis and there's some evidence against that hypothesis. And more and more evidence starting to say, one of the things that antidepressant might do because it changes a neurotransmitters is increase the likelihood of the growth of the new brain cells in connectivity, synaptogenesis or neurogenesis and work against neuroatrophy or, or the death of cells and so little, we'll get back to this. Animals must take antidepressants for two or three weeks before they bump up the birth rate of brain cells and the cells take maybe another two weeks to start functioning. That's consistent with the time-- the lag time antidepressants show before they lift mood in people. Although, some people, as soon as they take their first antidepressants feel better that may be the placebo effect. But if you actually studied in the animal model, brain cell start to, to come be more likely to be born after a few-- three or four weeks, month, two months, interesting. Okay, if an antidepressant is given during a period of chronic stress, it prevents the decline in neurogenesis so they stress mice and then they give them antidepressants and they don't lose the brain cells, that they lose an untreated stress, right. Okay, interesting. 

01:47:10
Neurogenic/Neuroatrophy Hypothesis People with head injuries in early adulthood experience higher rates of depression over their lifetimes. Exercise, which combats depression in people, also promotes neurogenesis in the hippocampus So does electroconvulsive therapy, popularly known as shock treatment, which works in human cases of severe depression. Scientists have also found evidence that the hippocampus shrinks in people who have had long-standing depression. • Altair, C.A., et. al. (2003), "Effects of electroconvulsive seizures and antidepressant drugs on brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein in rat brain." Biological Psychiatry. 54(7):703-709. • Ruso-Neustadt, A.A, et al. (2004), "Hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression following treatment with reboxetine, citalopram, and physical exercise." Neuropsychopharmacology, 29(12):2189-2199. 

01:47:10
BILL O'HANLON Let me give you a few more here, right. People with head injuries in early adulthood experience higher rates of depression over their lifetimes. That's correlational but it suggest it, all right. Exercise which combats depression in people also promotes neurogenesis in the hippocampus, right. So does electroconvulsive therapy, popularly known as shock treatment, which works in human cases in severe depression. You know, when I started then to study exercise a little more because I wasn't in exercise. Then, I started to read books about exercise, I learned this things which maybe some of you who are lifelong sports people and exercise knew when you run, you're damaging your bones. That is there's little cracks that appear in your bones and then the body goes hey, cracks, you're damage. Let's sense some, you know, immune system repair and then your bones grow stronger. When you're lifting weights that are so hard for you to lift, you're tearing your muscles. That's why I didn't exercise really. You're hurting yourself. Damn, now, you're hurting your body when you're doing this stuff but if you hurt it in a little way, your body mobilizes you. Well, it's interesting because, if you let you shock the brain, they don't know why it works. Again, there's theories about it. Well, one of the theories is the brain goes hey, we're under attack, builds some new brain cells. Makes some new connectivity. So if it gets damage by that, we've heard that but it may ultimately stimulate the brain to begin to produce new brain cells and create new connect-- connectivity. It's like wow, I never thought of electroconvulsive therapy like that but that's one of the theories, right. Scientists have also found evidence that the hippocampus shrinks in people who have had long-standing depression. That's where you see the DNA and brain scans. There's like a hole where the hippocampus, you know, was pumping out brain cells. Before, it's weird, it gets smaller, right? 

01:49:05
Neurogenic/Neuroatrophy Hypothesis • Postmortem studies have shown that depressed patients had decreased hippocampal and cortical BDNF levels • Several studies have shown increased BDNF when people are treated with anti-depressants for some time Altair, C.A. (1999). "Neurotrophins and depression," Trends in Pharmacological Science, 20(2):59-61. Karege, F. et al. (2002). "Decreased serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in major depressed patients," Psychiatry Research, 109(2):143-148. Sen, S. et al. (2008). "Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor, depression, and anti-depressant medications: meta-analyses and implications," Biological Psychiatry, 64:527-532. 

01:49:05
BILL O'HANLON All right, so, uhm, so this is neurogenesis neuro-- ah, atrophy hypothesis. Postmortem studies have shown that depressed people had depress-- decreased hippocampal and cortical what they call BDNF levels. This is the miracle growth of the brain. Uhm, several studies show that increased BDNF when people are treated with anti-depressants for some times. So it's brain derived neurotrophic factor which the some people (inaudible ) guy called the neuro, ah, uhm, this growth factor for the brains. It-- it's an hormone that helps to grow new brain stuff. Now, there's also other hormones that have you grew-- grow new brain vessel-- blood vessels in the brain which then feeds new cells. 

01:49:45
Neurogenic/Neuroatrophy Hypothesis • 27 depressed patients and 19 control participants were presented with visual images intended to evoke either a positive or a negative emotional response. While viewing these images, participants were instructed to use cognitive strategies to increase, decrease or maintain their emotional responses to the images by imagining themselves in similar scenarios • Experimenters used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity in the activity in the brain target areas. The scientists examined the extent to which activation in the brain's reward centers to positive pictures was sustained over time. • The experiment found that depressed patients showed normal levels of sustained activity in the reward centers early on in the experiment. However, towards the end of the experiment, those levels of activity dropped off precipitously. Heller, A. et. al. (2009), "Reduced capacity to sustain positive emotion in major depression reflects diminished maintenance of frontostriatal brain activation." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, doi: 10.1073/pnas.0910651106. 

01:49:50
BILL O'HANLON So there are a bunch of hormones that we'll talk about. Uhm, in this control study, 27 depressed, ah, patients and, uhm, 19 control participants were presented with visual images intended to evoke either a positive or a negative emotional response and the people who are depressed couldn't hold the po-- they can feel positive emotions. They just couldn't hold them. There was no brain scaffolding the whole of the positive emotions because they were losing brain cells and they were not having an easy time making connectivity. 

01:50:20
Dr. R. Douglas Fields, NIH neuroscientist and researcher • From the neurotransmitter theory to brain connectivity and plasticity • The brain becomes less plastic, less able to adapt and learn when the person becomes seriously depressed • Brain atrophy/damage can take place with the stress of longer-term depression that is untreated • Exercise can increase levels of BDNF and other factors that can oppose that atrophy and damage Smita Thakker-Varia, Jennifer Jernstedt Krol, Jacob Nettleton, Parizad M.

01:50:20
BILL O'HANLON So they could remember positive thinking and they couldn't hold it very well. So that's, ah, researcher who's actually studying glions as part of depression, a very interesting stuff and was part of brain growth. Uhm, you know, that they didn't know that stuff, uhm, had anything where there's the white matter instead of gray matter. It's very interesting stuff that Douglas Fields and he say, "Look, you know, this is the stuff that we found really makes the difference. There's, ah, brain growth stuff, ah, with exercise." 

01:50:45
The mechanisms for brain cell growth (neurogenesis) • IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor) • VEGF (vascular endothial growth factor) • BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) "Miracle Grow for the brain" 

01:50:45
BILL O'HANLON And so here's the mechanism for that brain growth. So far, again, this is early stuff but insulin-like growth factor that get stimulated by exercise and some other things. Ah, vascular en-- endothial growth factor which helps the blood vessel growth in the brain and, ah, BDNF brain-derived neurotrophic factor which has been called the miracle grow for the brain, right. 

01:51:10
What affects brain growth and connection? • Learning new things that stretch your abilities (not too much) and repeating those things through deliberate practice • Top things • New language • Music Among expert musicians, certain areas of the cortex are up to 5% larger than in people with little or no musical training, recent research shows. In musicians who started their training in early childhood, the neural bridge that links the brain's hemispheres, called the corpus callosum, is up to 15% larger. A professional musician's auditory cortex - the part of the brain associated with hearing - contains 130% more gray matter than that of non-musicians. • New physical abilities (juggling, typing and so on) • Exercise (vigorous aerobic) 

01:51:10
BILL O'HANLON So, what affects brain growth and connection? Learning new things that stretch your abilities but not too much and repeating those things through deliberate practice make new connections. Throughout life, if you have the brain cells there to do it. All right, and that's top things that people have been using are learning a new language. Learning a new language has been shown to be correlated with, you know, longer time for onset of, ah, dementia or Alzheimer's and, you know, new brain connections and things like that. Music seems to have a whole brain effect of growing brain cells or accumulating of growth of brain cells or new connections. Uhm, they, they, they've have shown that, ah, certain areas to the cortex of expert musicians are 5% larger than in people with little or no musical training and, ah, musicians who started their training in early childhood, the neural bridge that links the brain's hemispheres is the corpus callosum, is up to 15% larger than, ah, compared with average, ah, folks. And a professional musician's auditory corn-- cortex that contains 130 more-- 130% more gray matter than that of non-musicians. New physical abilities, typing, juggling, whatever in physical activities and then the last one is vigorous aerobic, exercise which is the-- that was the depressing new for me. Man, a book called Spark by another psychiatrist named John Ratey. John Ratey, interesting guy, he wrote Driven to Distraction with Ed Hallowell and then, he was in practice, he didn't practice and he had a patient come in who is a physician and this guy was a runner and then, he blood his knee. He couldn't run anymore and the guy got severely depressed. He'd been a runner all his adult life and he never had major depression and he said, "I think I was depressed when I was younger then I started running and I was never subject to severe depression. But when I couldn't run anymore I think it's knock up on me." And Ratey said, "You know, I've seen this before." And he said, "Interestingly, I used to run marathon and I have ADHD." And he said, "When I stop running marathon, my ADHD got really a lot worst." And he said, "So, I wonder if there's a connection between mood disorders and exercise." And he went look in the literature and he hired a research assistant and he found that there was and in the end of that book, he, he talked about the evidence. This book is called Sparks and it's a really nice book, you can get it if you want. I think it's worth awhile, worth reading. And at the end of that book, someone asked him, "How much exercise do you recommend for brain growth?" And he said, "Six days a week, 15 minutes a day, a vi-- vigorous aerobic exercise." Really, really? There's no other like shortcut or whatever and I started exercising every day. Six days a week, vigorous aerobic exercise. Not for any health reasons because I wanted to work better. I love learning, I love reading, I love, you know, and I was like and I lost little weight and I got a little healthier and maybe I'll die a little later, a little better because of that but, you know, it was really for my brain. I was so into it and I think if I had a client. Now you, it went by fast on Dean Norris but he said, "Walking three times a week has been shown increase brain size." So you don't have to run, I did because that, they said that's the most you can do, eat well, don't have stress, and exercise six days a week, 15 minutes a day. And I was like, okay, all right, if that's what I have to do and I gradually got used to it and it didn't, didn't bother me so much. 

01:54:50
Exercise and brain blood vessel growth In people ages 60-80, those who aerobically exercised 3+ hours a week over the course of 10 years showed: • An increase in the number of large blood vessels in the cerebral region of the brain • An increase in blood flow in the 3 major cerebral arteries • The cerebral area controls consciousness, memory, initiation of activity, emotional response, language and word associations • Narrowing and loss of blood vessels may be associated with cognitive decline Rahman, Feraz, et. al (2008). Study presented at Radiological Society of North America; UNC Chapel Hill researchers. 

01:54:50
BILL O'HANLON So there was a lot of research about exercise and brain growth. There's-- it seems to me a couple of mechanisms. One is as with the heart, the more you exercise the less your arteries are clog and the more br-- blood gets to your brain so it can help it to function well. So there's some e-- evidence on this that you-- if you get better blood, ah, flow to the brain, those people who exercise three plus hours a week over the course of 10 years and they were 60 to 80 years old showed an increase in the number of large blood vessels in the cerebral region of the brain, an increase in blood flow to the major three cerebral arteries, and the cerebral area controls consciousness, memory, initiation of activity, emotional response, language, and word associations. Now do you remember early on when Andrew Solomon said, "I stood there thinking, you just reach over a new dial of the telephone but I couldn't do it." There's a part of the brain that's in the cerebral cortex that controls initiation, right. He couldn't initiate an activity. When someone call they can pick up the phone in reaction but there was damage to that part of the brain from the depressive stress, I think he was under and so this is a way to kinda counteract that, ah, narrowing and loss of blood vessels, of course, is, is associated with cognitive decline so having those is good for the brain in general. 

01:56:15
Exercise and Mood Disorders • Growing evidence of strong and lasting effects of exercise on depression and anxiety, as well as anger • Beats medications in some trials for lingering positive effects • Has been shown to work on people who are not responding to medications 

01:56:15
BILL O'HANLON Now, there's a bunch of evidence about mood disorders and that's of course what we're talking about here with depression. There's strong evidence of lasting effects in possitie effects on of exercise on depression and anxiety, as well as anger, actually. And it beats medications in some of the trials for lingering positive effects and it's been shown to work on people who are not responding well to medications so called treatment resistant, ah, patients in psychiatric treatment. And, uhm, I came across another book to summarize this tre-- this, ah, research by a psychologist named Keith Johnsgard, Conquering Depression and Anxiety Through Exercise. 

01:56:50
SMILE (Standard Medical Intervention and Long Term Exercise) • 156 adults, diagnosed w/Major Depression Randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups • 1) Exercise treatment • Exercise consisted of brisk walking, jogging or stationary bicycle riding 3x/week • 10 min. warm-up; 30-min. exercise; 5-minute cool down 2) Zoloft treatment 3) Combined treatment "Exercise and Pharmacotherapy in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder," James A. Blumenthal, PhD et. al, Psychosomatic Medicine, 69:587-596 (2007). 

01:56:55
BILL O'HANLON And this is the, the best study today, I think. The SMILE study done-- they do, do or they do a lot of work with weight loss and, and problems and everything. They did study and they as has called it that they have this cute name for SMILE, the Standard Medical Intervention and Long Term Exercise trial. They had 156 adults, all d-- diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. They randomly assigned with three treatment groups. The first one had Zoloft. Their exercise treatment and exercise treatment involved, uhm, exercising, ah, the warm up time, uhm, so you see the walking, the jogging, or stationary bicycle three times a week. There was a 10-minute warm-up, ah, 30-minute exercise, five-minute cool down. And then Zoloft treatment was second condition and the third condition was combined, exercise and Zoloft. Okay. 

01:57:40
SMILE (Standard Medical Intervention and Long Term Exercise) • At the end of 4 months, 60-70% of the participants were "vastly improved" or "symptom-free" in all 3 conditions • On 10-month follow-up: • 38% of Zoloft condition subjects had recurrence • 31% of the combined condition had recurrence • 8% of the exercise only had recurrence (and people who continued to exercise were less likely as a group to have recurrence) Hypothesis: Self-efficacy; brain growth 

01:57:40
BILL O'HANLON And so here was the result, they all worked, okay. At the end of four months, 60 to 70% of the participants were vastly improved or symptom-free in all three conditions. But here's the interesting thing, on 10-month follow-up, the Zoloft condition 38% even when they stay on Zoloft had recurrence, 31% of the combined condition, Zoloft plus exercise, had recurrence so few less. That's nice, that helped. Here was the stunning thing, only 8% of the exercise only people had recurrence. Now, I don't know the explanation from that. There's a few hypothesis. One is they did it themselves so they contribution to the medication. Maybe that last a little longer. Self-efficacy, we'll here half of the vendor are talking about that. Our vendor are talking about that but brain growth could have been another thing. Maybe exercise is way better for brain growth and antidepressants. I-- we don't know yet. 

01:58:35
SMILE (Standard Medical Intervention and Long Term Exercise) How much exercise matters: Every 50 minutes of exercise per week correlated with a 50% drop in depression levels "Exercise and Pharmacotherapy in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder," James A. Blumenthal, PhD et. al, Psychosomatic Medicine, 69:587-596 (2007). 

01:58:40
BILL O'HANLON But here's the interesting thing too, the more exercise they did, the less depressed they got. Fif-- every 50 minutes of exercise per week correlated with a 50% drop in depression levels, 50% drop in depression levels, that's pretty good, right. All right. 

01:58:55
Exercise and Mood: Depression research Two studies found: • People who participated in moderately intense aerobics, such as exercising on a treadmill or stationary bicycle - whether it was for three or five days per week - experienced a decline in depressive symptoms by an average of 47% after 12 weeks • Those in the low-intensity exercise groups showed a 30% reduction in symptoms • Exercise also helped people who were unresponsive to medications Trivedi, M.H., Greer, T.L., Grannemann, B.D., Chambliss, H.O., Jordan, A.N, "Exercise as an Augmentation Strategy for Treatment of Major Depression." Journal of Psychiatric Practice, 12(4):205-13, 2006 Andrea L. Dunn, Madhukar H. Trivedi, James B. Kampert, Camillia G. Clark and Heather O. Chambliss, "Exercise treatment for depression: Efficacy and dose response," American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 28, Issue 1, January 2005, Pages 1-8 

01:58:55
BILL O'HANLON So, uhm, let's give you a couple of more and then we'll talk about how you might implement as a treatment. People who partici-- so there was another psychiatrist who decided to do some research, a guy named Trivedi, down in, ah, Texas and he said, "I have these patients. I treat people with medications but these patients are treatment resistant. They either won't take medications or they can't tolerate them. Side effects are there or we can't find anyone that really works to alleviate the depression." I won-- and he read this trial and he said, "I wonder if exercise work for my treatment resistant people." So they created another trial. Basically, he had them a moderately intensive aerobics such as exercising on a treadmill or stationary bicycle, three or five days a week, they experienced, ah, a decline in depressive symptoms by an average of 47% after 12 weeks in the exercise trial. Those in the low-intensity exercise groups showed a 30% reduction in symptoms and it also helped people who were unresponsive to medications. 

01:59:50
Exercise and Mood: Depression research A Purdue University study found: Middle-aged runners who had been running 3-5 times/week for 3-10 years were markedly less depressed than a matched comparison group. D. Lobstein et al., "Depression as a Powerful Discriminator Between Physically Active and Sedentary Middle-Aged Men," Journal of Psychosomatic Medicine, 27 (1983):69-76. 

01:59:50
BILL O'HANLON So this is Trivedi and he's done a several trials with other people. Uhm, a Purdue University study this is a correlational study, not ah, not designed study. Uhm, middle-aged runners who had been running three to five times a week for three to 10 years were markedly less depressed than a matched comparison group. 

02:00:10
ACTIVE (Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly) Study Cognitive/brain training that increased speed of processing in the elderly decreased the likelihood of developing depression (compared with a control group) by 38% as measured one year out. Fredric D. Wolinsky et. al. (2009). "The ACTIVE Cognitive Training Interventions and the Onset of and Recovery from Suspected Clinical Depression," The Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences, 64B(5):577-585 

02:00:10
BILL O'HANLON Now again, they're probably self selected so that's not a great study. Here is one that, that's another cute acronym, ah, Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly. If you don't love, uhm, exercising, they had them do brain exercising like this Luminosity you see on TV now. You know, there's, ah, the Brain HQ from, ah, from Merzenich's, ah, company and there are this-- there are control studies that show the more you exercise your brain, the more you create new brain connections and go a new brain cells. So they did with most elderly people. They gave a cognitive brain training that increased speed of processing in the elderly compared with, ah,-- and they'll decreased the likelihood 38% as measured one year out of having them, having them be depressed and depression is a common problem as people age, right. 

02:00:55
Exercise improves mood in elderly Seniors who had never exercised before experienced a mood-lifting effect (less depression and anxiety and better reported quality of life) from regular aerobic exercise (3X/week on alternate days for 6 months) Antunes, H.K. et. al. (2005). "Depression, anxiety, and quality of life scores in seniors after an endurance exercise program," Brasileira de Psiquiatria, 27(4):266-271. 

02:00:55
BILL O'HANLON Exercise improves mood in elderly. Seniors who had never exercised before started experiencing a mood-lifting effect, uhm, less depression and anxiety and better reported quality of life, from regular aerobic exercise, three times a week on alternate days for six months. Uhm, exercise worked as wel-- as well as an antidepressant in relieving minor depression, minor depression in seniors had the added effect of improving physical functioning such as walking more briskly. 

02:01:20
Exercise and Mood: Depression research A University of Virginia study found: • Exercise had the most profound mood-lifting effect on people who were depressed • The effect increased with the amount of exercise • The study also found reductions in anger and anxiety through exercise R. Brown et. al (1978). "The Prescription of Exercise for Depression," Physician and Sportsmedicine, 6:34-49. 

02:01:20
BILL O'HANLON So, ah, University of Virginia studied, exercise had the most profound mood-lifting effect on people who were depressed. When I started to exercise 6 days a week, I didn't feel that much happier. I wasn't depress and I was thinking, "You know, that was mood stuff. That doesn't really-- well, I don't experience that but I wasn't depressed." So it didn't have that much on effect with me but for people who are depressed, typically has an effect, the effect increase with the amount of exercise. Study also found reductions in anger and anxiety through exercise. 

02:01:50
Exercise and Mood: Depression research Beware of "overtraining," or exercising too much (as in anorexia and other compulsive problems) • The evidence shows that over-exercising (exercising several times a day at training levels that are at or near maximal) is correlated with depressed moods W. Morgan et. al (1991). "Psychological Monitoring of Overtraining and Staleness," British Journal of Sports Medicine, 12:146-59 

02:01:50
BILL O'HANLON So that's kind of a nice side effect. All right, let's give you just a few more. Here is the problem. Some people get so into this if you over exercise you can get depressed. Albertos-- ah, Alberto Salazar who won the New York City marathon, after he won, next year he got severely depressed. He had over trained. Now most of us are not endanger of over training, I just want you to know. But people who had the anorexia may be do that, you know, uhm, of severe-- you know, people really in exercising. Over exercising is defined as exercising several times a day at training levels that are at or near maximal training levels. I have never approach this. So I just wanted you to know and I'm pretty dedicated exerciser but some people might so you have to watch out for that. 

02:02:35
Dr. John Ratey on exercise and mood disorders • Serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine levels and regulation affected by exercise 

02:02:40
BILL O'HANLON It's not just exercise more and you'll get more effect. There's at lab diminishing-- let me just skip that because it's not a great quality of audio. Uhm, so my fiance who's a psychiatrist and who's a dedicated exerciser. When I started to exercise she said, "Read this book, if you're not an exerciser." So I recommend this to some of my clients, uhm, the, ah, younger next year as written by a physician and he's patient and this patient came in at 70 and said, "What's your favorite--" he got a new doctor and he said, "What's your favorite kind of patient?" He said, "The one who's willing to do, well, he needs to do to be younger next year, physiologically younger next year." He said, "I'll be your guinea pig." And they did this book together and the, the guy who's the patient is a hilarious writer and the doctor is a very good writer and they read-- wri-- write each other, ah, ah, every other chapter and I learn more about growing brain cells and doing it sensibly through this book and that was a nice motivation book. Younger Next Year, there's a younger next year for women. Uhm, this is a general one and it's mostly, you know, orient towards men but you can read it. Uhm, and I recommend this to my clients sometimes if they find it helpful. 

02:03:45
Getting people to exercise • Walking sessions • Baby steps • The solution-oriented method • The buddy system • Linking to motivation • Away from/toward 

02:03:45
BILL O'HANLON So how do you get people depressed people to exercise? You'd maybe thinking. I'm sure some of you are. You know, they can't get out of bed kind of thing, all right., the simple as way as to do walking sessions. You're sitting in your office talking to them or in the hospital talking to them, get up walk around the corridor in the hospital. Get up walk around the block. If you're living a place like I grow up in Chicago go to the shopping mall and do your walking session there. For depressed people, get them moving. Even walking around to your office would be a little better than sitting there. So that's a way to do it, ah, baby steps. When I got on that treadmill for the first time, you may laugh but five minutes I was totally winded and I never wanted to do it again and so I'd had okay, I, I know, I know my tendency. I'm gonna dive into this. I'm gonna do it really hard then I'm gonna quit. So I did five minutes a day which was-- I, I want you to know, I was totally out of breath the first week, five minutes a day but I wouldn't go anymore in five minutes. And then I did six minutes the next week and I did ba-- I just walk myself up so I could now run for 50 minutes. And I-- if you were to said that I-- you could run for 50 minutes, I said you are insane. I never gonna be able to run for 50 minutes like five minutes I was almost having heart attack. So, uhm, baby steps, small, small thing so when I say six times a week, 50 minutes of, you know, intense aerobic exercise. I didn't start there and most people won't get there but if they can walk once a week that's good. They can go up to stairs, park their car a little farther away from the, you know grocery store, that's were something, right. So get him to do small things that are movement oriented, I use the solution oriented method. You know, have we ever done anything that's difficult before? That you really were resisting and it was hard for you and they tell me how they've done that. I say, "Can you apply that to getting moving?" And I don't call it exercise, I said, "Just, you gotta get moving a little more to stimulate your brain." So, so have you ever exercise before and how did you do it? And they'll tell you sometimes cuz they've been able to do it or they've gotten moving. Oh, you know, I'm, you know I stared walking up to steps when the elevator was broken one day and I'm just kept it up and that was cool. Okay, so why don't you take the steps? So the buddy system, there's some researcher says, "If you make a commitment to someone else, you're more likely fall through when your will flags." And they are more likely to fall through and you help them fall through. So he met a friend at the corner and they were at the corner and you take a walk together. And they're counting on you and even when you-- I wanna go to the-- well, they're waiting for me, I gotta go. You know, I got to call them make an excuse, right. So it's harder. The buddy system seems to work pretty well. Linking it to motivation. So I did have two motivations. I was always thin but I developed a midlife tummy which I didn't like so I had the positive motivation which is I wanna grow a new brain cells and be a lifelong learner and at the negative motivation, I wanna get rid of this fat belly, right. So what are away from and toward motivations is if you can link the exercise so that's an obviously in the case of depression, they don't wanna feel so bad but maybe they have some positive motivation to that they wanna be healthy for their grand kids or, yeah, I don't what, you know, something that they want and something that they wanna get away from unusually the depression is something they wanna get away from. 

02:07:10
Recommendations for among of exercise • For anxiety, maybe as little as 10-15 mins. can reduce anxiety • 3x/week for at least 20 mins. aerobic exercise at 50-70% of maximum heart rate for relief of depression • For maximum brain growth and learning: 6x/week for 50 minutes at 50-70% of maximum heart rate • And then learn something new in the next 24 hours • Stretch yourself by doing/learning something beyond your comfort 

02:07:10
STEPHANIE DAILEY All right. So, again, what are the recommendations from-- that I've gather from this stuff? For anxiety, we haven't been talking about that here but maybe as little as 10 or 15 minutes of exercise, aerobic exercise can reduce anxiety. I could list some evidence that anaerobic exercise can increase anxiety but won't get in to that here. Uhm, three times a week at least 20 minutes, ah, aerobic exercise for-- at 50 to 70% of maximum heart rate for relief of depression. That seems to be the minimal that seems to help depression pretty powerfully and, you know, obviously, it's good for your heart and your brain and things like that. Uhm, for maximal brain growth and learning, six times a week for 50 minutes of 50 to 70% of maximum heart rate and if you don't our heart rate read that book. It's somebody use an exercise of the show you these heart monitors that you can strap on your chest and things like that and you find out your heart rate where, where you're in the zone there. And then, if you wanna really stimulate your brain, learn something new in the next 24 hours. When I first start exercising, I would do this then now, I played music. I would go learn the new song right away and it was something that was a bit of stretch for me because I wanted to use that new brain power just, you know, pump out brain cells, who cares? But, you know, get to learn something and put something in the brain, you know. Exercise the cranium, something like that and then, stretch yourself by doing or learning something that slightly beyond your comfort zone. It can't be something you already know cuz there's no learning there. You have to get yourself to move in a new way learn something new, perceive something in a new way, and that's stimulates the brain in certain way. Okay, it make sense. 

02:08:45
How to translate this in clinical work • Consider doing "walking sessions" • Encourage clients/patients to move as much as they are able 

02:08:45
BILL O'HANLON All right, so how to translate this in clinical work? Again, consider doing walking sessions. Encourage clients and patients to move as much as they are able, right.

02:10:10
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

02:10:10
BILL O'HANLON Carry on, on it. Just speak. Yeah, that's one. 

02:10:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:10:15
BILL O'HANLON No, no. 

02:10:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, there we go. 

02:10:15
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

02:10:15
UNKNOWN Ah, whenever you're talking out music helping with neurogenesis is that listening or just playing. 

02:10:20
BILL O'HANLON Ah, listening can help but playing, I think it's the physical movement I think that's really part of it but it's the integration of the listening and the playing that seems to be the most powerful but listening to music can help. Yeah. 

02:10:35
UNKNOWN Ah, it's a q-- I have a question about the mindfulness plan. 

02:10:35
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

02:10:35
UNKNOWN Bo-- both your description of depression and Solomon's description of depression, they were depressed about being depressed. 

02:10:45
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

02:10:45
UNKNOWN And, ah, in a very deep way and it seems like saying, "Okay, don't be depressed to be mindful." And it doesn't seems like that will be anywhere near as effective. 

02:10:55
BILL O'HANLON The mindfulness is just notice your depression without anything that's second layer. You know, it's like we have nothing to fear but fear itself. If you're afraid of being afraid it amplifies it but if you just notice I'm depressed without saying I shouldn't be depressed or I'm depressed about being depressed. The noticing seems to at least to solve one later of depression. That make sense or am I answering your question or I haven't said anything? 

02:11:20
UNKNOWN But it, it seems like, ah, ah, I don't understand how you get to that. What would you tell someone who you want to bring to that when they say, "Well, I'm, I'm, I'm a bad person, become ashamed to depressed." What do you get asked that? 

02:11:30
BILL O'HANLON It's sort of a witnessing. It's sort of like, okay, notice, you know, it's Jeffrey Schwartz does this, of the OCD. You know, Jeffrey Schwartz were-- he gets people to notice that the OCD is saying you didn't lock the door. You didn't turn off the stove. He gets them to be a witness to the thoughts and mindfulness is, you know, in the Buddhist centers, you sit there and noted some-- but I think the essence of mindfulness is not be your thoughts but to notice your thoughts, not be the sensation in your body but notice it. So you're helping them to develop an observer of experience rather than get swept in the storm or ba-- buy into the assessment. You know, like I didn't turn off the stove and the people in Schwartz', ah, group where he trained. Somebody say, "That's my OCD telling me I didn't turn off the stove." They notice it rather than, oh, I didn't turn of the stove and I'm anxious about that it might else gonna burn down. 

02:12:30
UNKNOWN Oh, I'm being depressed about being depressed. 

02:12:30
BILL O'HANLON Right, and notice that you're being depressed about being depressed. 

02:12:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:12:35
BILL O'HANLON Isn't that interesting? Yeah, just to be curious about it. Good, good question. Yeah. 

02:12:40
UNKNOWN Uhm, my question is about the contrast between the treasure of being depressed and being in that depress state because we have many like even psychologists, great writers, and philosophers who, who were depressed the whole life and even commit suicide and their brain cells didn't die and even it grows and they were always super active, super creative in their mind. But on the other side, we have the brain cells die in the depress state. Because, you know, for me my head-- the patients with depression are better than the dep-- ah, deep persons who are norm and just following the ordinary life. I, I really invite depression and I feel happy when I see a patient with depression and I say, "Okay, fine." At least we have something to work on and your psyche and your soul is inviting you to in any realm but the brain cell is just making me confuse that, okay, that's the realm of treasure. 

02:13:50
BILL O'HANLON Well, so I'll tell you two things. One is I told you the hypothesis. I'm not telling you the truth. I'm just giving a story and it's a scientific, possibly, a scientific story. We'll find out more that are not as time goes on so that's one thing. The second thing is some people functioning very highly and they're under great deal stress and stress we find thus tend to decrease neurogenesis and neuroconnectivity and so, it maybe both. They are functioning really high and they really have great brain capacities and they're also suffering from that stress. I don't know, I don't know the answer to that question but that would just be two speculations. 

02:14:30
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:14:30
BILL O'HANLON And, you know, the fact that you go, this is so great. I bet that sort of shifting for them because they're thinking not so great and you go on, oh, great. Now, we got something to work with and energy that you're infusing into it probably is part of the healing process I would think. 

02:14:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:14:45
BILL O'HANLON Now, you're giving them-- you feel hope. You don't go, oh, no, another depress but you can go, great, another depress person. 

02:14:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, I always tell them that great, you're a depressed. We have something to work on. 

02:14:55
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, and they're like geez, psychotically optimistic. What's going on with them? Yeah, but you, you know with it, you do feel hope and that communication of hope, I think is part of that future pull that you're communicating from the very first moment. They tell you that they're depress and I think that's powerful. 

02:15:10
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

02:15:10
BILL O'HANLON Good, thank you. 

02:15:10
UNKNOWN Forgive me for making two comment rather than question, okay. 

02:15:15
BILL O'HANLON It's not a problem that you chose to say comments. 

02:15:15
UNKNOWN I, I, I notice that omission. I think it's really important that would motivate people. People are more scared of Alzheimer's and dementia than for anything else more than cancer these days. 

02:15:25
BILL O'HANLON Right. 

02:15:25
UNKNOWN And exercise is a risk reducer for-- I can't say preventive. 

02:15:30
BILL O'HANLON No, it's not so clear. 

02:15:30
UNKNOWN But it reduces risk very much. 

02:15:35
BILL O'HANLON More and more evidence is coming. 

02:15:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

02:15:35
BILL O'HANLON The more you've learned through your life and the more active you are. 

02:15:40
UNKNOWN So the physical exercise reduces risk for dementia. 

02:15:40
BILL O'HANLON That's good. Good. 

02:15:40
UNKNOWN Okay, and second thing, for people who hate to exercise, I was one of those but I do it anyway, it's much more tolerable if you listen into an audio book while you're running or jogging and then you're doing both at the same time. 

02:15:55
BILL O'HANLON I u-- used that. I distract myself so I don't actually know I'm exercising. That's right. Really have-- and I'm learning something new. Actually, you don't learn quite as well when you're exercising but after you exercise but you can ju-- you know, you, you can learn well enough. I mean, your brain still functions but I, ah, that's how I did. I would say things that I really wanted to listen and I was a I'm not gonna be able to listen to rest of that audio book or watch that thing until I'm on that treadmill and that was a really good motivator for me. You're right, great tip. Yeah. 

02:16:25
UNKNOWN Hi, I was just interested in, ah, your comments about the use of antidepressants and, uhm, neurogenesis in the brain. Uhm, are you recommending the use in your patient in order to save in your own and so you can work on these all the methods with them. 

02:16:40
BILL O'HANLON If I were as depressed as I was I didn't, I couldn't get myself to a therapist or a psychiatrist or physician. I wasn't even that confident when I was depressed. I didn't know about it very well. I wasn't very educated. If I were as depressed as I was then enda-- especially endanger of dying, I take medica-- I'm, Im not big on medication but I would taka medications in a heartbeat and I would recommend anyone I love to take them. I would even recommend it if they were an untreatable, unresponsive depression to medication. I'd recommend electroshock there. We would the electroconvulsive therapy that, that is now. I would recommend that and I've had friends that had been so severely depressed. I have friends that gonna lose, I might say, "Look and consider electroconvulsive therapy." But they go, "No, I'd rather die," and I think, "You may die, I would do it if I had no other alternative." Because there are some evidence that for unresponsive depression it works and I'm not for that stuff. I'm not big on it. I'm not big on medications. I'm not big on ECT but the suffering is so severe. Yes, I would do it and I'm, in case to a psychiatrist and she has the medication to great effect. She specializes in mood disorder and she believes in it and she actually believes that it changes your serotonin so, ah, we have this discussion all the time. Uhm, and she is in the great effect and she's a compassionate Buddhist person and I think she does great work with people and I see people get better. 

02:18:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:18:05
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

02:18:05
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

02:18:10
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

02:18:10
UNKNOWN Question. 

02:18:10
BILL O'HANLON Thank you. Where are you? 

02:18:10
UNKNOWN Oh, here. 

02:18:10
BILL O'HANLON Thank you, thank you. 

02:18:10
UNKNOWN I'm sorry. Uhm, what about EMDR, what, what would you recommend on that one? 

02:18:20
BILL O'HANLON You know, I learned EMDR for trauma then I start to use it for pain. I've never actually use it for depression but if there are that are stressful related to traumas and unresolved, unprocessed stuff as, as Francine calls it. Sure, what the heck? And I do think it changes patterns. I think EMDR changes your brain patterns, changes your physiological patterns. So it-- it's in line with one of the things that I said, I would certainly try it. Yeah. 

02:18:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:18:45
BILL O'HANLON That was good. I've never personally use it but I'm sure other people have and Francine (inaudible ) even some research that she knows about that. You can ask her. 

02:18:50
UNKNOWN Yes, she talk about some new research on not trauma based but just depression and anxiety. 

02:18:55
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, mood disorders, stuff like that and I, I had first heard the expansion but she was talking about learning. She said she was using with people with learning problem - 

02:19:05
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:19:05
BILL O'HANLON - cuz it put the brain into a better learning state so you can imagine, you probably has some of these neurotrophic effects but I don't know for sure. 

02:19:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:19:10
BILL O'HANLON But thanks, it's a good question. 

02:19:15
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

02:19:15
BILL O'HANLON Good observation. Is anybody else have a question or comment before we... 

02:19:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

02:19:20
BILL O'HANLON Oh, thank you. 

02:19:20
UNKNOWN Uhm, I work with pregnant women so I see a lot of women who suffer from postpartum depression. 

02:19:25
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

02:19:25
UNKNOWN So are-- when you-- so when I was, I was hearing your discussion I kind of wonder does are, are you thinking women who are depressed also after delivery or is that an inner category all by itself? 

02:19:45
BILL O'HANLON I don't know the answer to that. 

02:19:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:19:45
BILL O'HANLON I don't, I don't-- I'm not much been expert on that. I didn't know about it but I don't know. That's a good question because I suspect there is something hormonally and they're given a lot of their nutrition to their baby. 

02:19:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:19:55
BILL O'HANLON I'm not sure what, you know, as much as we need to about that and I would really, you know, be interesting cuz your more of an expert and expert in what you discover about better what you're observations. 

02:20:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. Right. 

02:20:05
BILL O'HANLON Especially, putting this together. I'm sure some of this you've used already. 

02:20:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, well, I've suffered from postpartum depression. 

02:20:10
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

02:20:10
UNKNOWN And that's why I was so interested in getting more, you know, information and now working with a lot of women, so... 

02:20:20
BILL O'HANLON That same follow your wound thing, huh? 

02:20:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:20:20
BILL O'HANLON You know you were sensitize that and now you make the contribution that's a great thing for your recovery and likelihood of not experiencing again I think. 

02:20:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:20:30
BILL O'HANLON That's according to my idea so good for you. Thanks. 

02:20:35
UNKNOWN Hi. 

02:20:35
BILL O'HANLON Hi. 

02:20:35
UNKNOWN I-- at first one I just say appreciated you, uhm, talking about narrative therapy and Michael White because you're the first person that at this presentation that I heard mention him and I... 

02:20:45
BILL O'HANLON That's all right. 

02:20:45
UNKNOWN I enjoy that. 

02:20:45
BILL O'HANLON Thank you. 

02:20:45
UNKNOWN And then I wanted to say that I work with people have traumatic brain injuries and I wondered if you have any experience working these methods with people that have traumatic brain injuries? 

02:21:00
BILL O'HANLON I have but I wasn't thinking exactly like this when I, when I did but I think, you know, you have a lot more experience with that but I think, you know, I think people used to be told when you have, you know, the-- those brain cells got up that part of your brain is emplace anymore. There's no recovery and again, you know, that brain that changes itself, uhm, and, ah, I think that shows you that there's hope for folks like we that shouldn't dismissed the possibility, you know, and they probably will have limitations but maybe not the narrow limitations we thought they would have for life. There's a possibility of more rehab based on this stuff and I, I again where in early days and there's also a lot of depression that goes all around too, you know. 

02:21:45
UNKNOWN Definitely. 

02:21:45
BILL O'HANLON Because they weren't functioning like they were before. The relationship shift, you know, they found on themselves all that stuff I'm sure you know and so, yeah, I think all this stuff could be useful but again I think it's early days in this stuff and, ah, we'll have to have you and other people, ah, pioneered little more. 

02:22:00
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

02:22:05
BILL O'HANLON Thank you, yeah, okay. Okay. Maybe la-- last one here, thanks. 

02:22:05
UNKNOWN Hey, I was wondering if there was significance to depresso-land being a map or would you use a different metaphor in such situations? 

02:22:15
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, if it gets-- it seems this is an interesting thing because I did that before I learn narrative therapy which is a different kind of percep-- idea about it. I was thinking with the place they are and that they can move out of it that as special metaphor and then, you know, narrative therapy has this, it's an external influence on you so it's not exactly a pla-- it's sort of a place but it's not a place they go and yeah, so that's just was the one I used for long time because, well, I'll just tell you a little story. When I was younger, until I was about 26, I was painfully shy. I mean just like, you know, I heard as comedian one time say, "I just played a gig in an accountants convention," and he says, "You know what the definition of an outgoing accountant is?" "No." "He looks at your shoes rather than his own shoes," and that was me. I was always looking my own shoes, you know, and I was about 25 and I was unsatisfied being this shy because I couldn't say what I wanted to say to people. I would, I would do that anything I would go home and I think about what I should have said for hours when I would be so frustrated cuz I hadn't said anything during the conversation. I'd feel like a fool and I get all anxious and you know, very much ruminate and I s-- I read something I, I'm not shy you've notice now these days and I read something that started to change from shy to not shy and I read "Maybe you're not shy, maybe you learned to do shy," and I can't tell you the electrifying liberating effect that had on me cuz I thought it was how I was and I started to think it's how I did my for self. I did my life and that is how I-- when I first started working with depression that's how I thought of it this is something that they do rather than something that they are and that was a liberating idea for me cuz I thought of it as a process or a changeable thing rather than a set state and the next metaphor that occurred to me is that the place they were, they were staying and they needed to move someplace else and they had experience being out of places. So I could draw up on that and that was the metaphor that occurred to me but that's not the only or the best metaphor because I'm in true metaphor. It's just a special one that uses an island or a land or something as a, as an idea and I like the narrative one a little better actually as time went on but that's the one that naturally occurred to me special activity metaphor or action metaphor. Yes, very good. Stood of you to notice that, actually. You were paying attention. 

02:25:00
UNKNOWN I'm still in student mode this is like... 

02:25:00
BILL O'HANLON Okay, yeah, good, good. 

02:25:00
UNKNOWN My first semester of... 

02:25:00
BILL O'HANLON Don't worry your brain will stop worrying very soon as you get out of here and that would be a chronic condition. You'll get in the practice and, you know, you'll get in. No, just joking but thank you. 

02:25:10
UNKNOWN Thank you.
