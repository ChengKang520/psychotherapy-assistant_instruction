SCOTT D. MILLER Good morning, if I can invite everybody to their seats we'll go ahead and get started with this presentation called REACH, here at the 2010 Evolution Conference. And here would you give yourselves a hand for showing up? All right. I am glad as hell to be out of Chicago. Uhm, I have to tell where it was -14°, ah, yesterday, ah, really very cold. I'm gonna talk to you about REACH, the work of my colleagues and I are doing right now at the present time. I am Scott Miller. Uhm, all of the information of-- thank you very much. All of the information that I'm going to present you can find on my website which is at scottdmiller.com, scottdmiller.com. You have to have the D in between Scott and Miller, ah, or you end up at another guy's website, ah, who is a very nice guy, Scott Miller. He's a very nice guy but it's not me. Ah, actually he is a Nashville Bluegrass musician, ah, and he and I trade e-mail back and forth, ah, every so often because I get asked to come to Anaheim to play bluegrass, ah, and I promise, ah, you do not want me singing, ah, or dancing, playing any musical instruments, etcetera. And he gets ask to come do workshops on psychotherapy, true story, ah, which he says he's been in by the way. Uhm, but other than that he doesn't know anything about it, go to scottdmiller.com, scroll down here to the fourth bullet point, ah, Scholarly Publications Handouts view to click right there and I promise you, you can download these handouts and the handouts that I do in other presentations and also, ah, here at the Evolution Conference and elsewhere. I hope you'll do that. My twitter handling in case you're twitting from the evolution conferences scott_dm, ah, I would love to connect with you on the Twitter. There are thousands and thousands of people who are talking about the ideas that you're going to be hearing about today. I'm also a part of these group called the International Center for Clinical Excellence. Ah, this is the largest web-based organization of mental health professionals in the world. ah, and it's completely free. Ah, there are no cost, no charges, no secret hidden levels from premium content. It's just putting clinicians shoulder to shoulder with each other, ah, to help each other. I'm going to point out you're going to hear in this presentation and others that I do here at the Evolution Conference that expertise is always local, it's always contextual. So, you have to rub shoulders with the people you're working with, I can certainly pass on some ideas here today but really in order to drive these ideas home, to make them work in your practice you'll have to talk to other clinicians, ICCE is the place to do it. There are hundreds and hundreds of, ah, how to videos, books, tapes etcetera and right here in the audience today we also have our community manager, ah, Cynthia Maeschalck. She's sitting right here in the audience, wave your hand Cynthia, ah, you can talk to her if you'd like about the ICCE. Okay, enough of the advertisements here, uhm, this is where I come from. Uhm, yeah, this is Chicago and, ah, it looks this one day a year. Ah, ah, the, ah, the, the, ah, and so whenever it looks like this we run at the top of the Hancock building and this picture is, ah, ah, pointing north and we take a picture to ri-- to remind us why we live there, ah, for the rest of the year. And I live right there, can you see it? Right there. Just the east of the Chicago River in case you wanna find me, let me point it out again. Ah, when you-- when you-- when you come you can find me there. But as I say most of the time it doesn't look like that it, ah, looks like this. Ah, and so what I do is most weeks, uhm, I get on a plane and I fly somewhere and I'm talking to people like you.

SCOTT D. MILLER Ah, I'm talking to mental health professionals, psychologist, psychiatrist, social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapist. I'm talking to administrators. Ah, people who are running the agencies and clinics, system of care, I'm talking to researchers, ah, and with researchers, payers, business executives and, of course, the all important regulators, the people who passed the rules, ah, that, ah, guide our profession, ah, or structure the profession in some way. And as I travel around no matter whether I'm here in the United States or abroad, uhm, I'm hearing one theme and one thing consistently, I'm sure you're hearing about it too and that is what does the evidence say about our work. Ah, it's not good enough to do good clinical work anymore, to fill in your forms and send them up. Remember those healthy, young days? The hick of 1500 form? Remember that? Yeah. What a-- what, what , ah, pain in the ass we thought that was. Ah, and now we recognize what a great and glorious time that was, ah, in the man-- or single piece of paper and then they send you money, ah, for doing the work. It's amazing. Not like that anymore, people want evidence, they want proof that what you do has value and merit. So, before I talk about pushing our clinical performance to the next level, why I'd like to do is talk about what is the evidence say about us now? It's important to hang on to this particular message because as the presentation lengthens, ah, and we talk more and more, it will be very easy to get discouraged by my message. Ah, so I want you to hang on to what we're gonna talk about right now because our evidence is good. And here's what it says. 

00:05:30
THE EVIDENCE • In most studies of treatment conducted over the last 40 years, the average treated person is better off than 80% of the untreated sample. • The outcome of behavioral health services equals and, in most cases, exceeds medical treatments. • On average, mental health professionals achieve outcomes on par with success rates obtained in randomized clinical trials (with and without co-morbidity).

00:05:30
SCOTT D. MILLER It says that in most studies of psychological treatments conducted over the last 40 years, in most studies the average treated person is better off in 80% of the untreated sample in those studies. This is referred to by researchers as an effect size, how big of an effect do we get compared to a similar group of untreated people, am I making sense to you? I am not saying that we are successful with 80% of the people we meet with. This is the strange rarefied way that researchers speak to one another. Researchers are always comparing the treated group to the untreated group. So, in a room full of untreated people with approximately the same issue are concern, in a room full of people with the same concern, ah, the one person who gets treatment, that one person who gets treatment is gonna better off than 80% of those who do not get treatment. Are you with me here? All right. Ah, the news is very good, our effect sizes are really-- comparable to most of medicine fact, take a look right up here, uhm, the outcome of behavioral health services equals and, in most cases, exceeds most medical treatments, it's amazing. Did you know psychotherapy has the same effect size as coronary artery bypass surgery, did you know this? Yeah, you don't see insurance companies doling out one vein in the cardiac process at a time. They don't do it, they value the procedure, the effects are large and here's the other cool part about all of you. You have a far more tolerable side effect profile. If there were an ad on TV and I'm waiting in vain for one to happen but if there were and ad on TV for what you do everyday, it wouldn't have to have that little black marks ad at the end that says, "May cause diarrhea, dizziness, lack of breath, a brain tumor, a death or worst of all in erection lasting four hours." My God, and here's the point about your work if your clients left your office with an erection that lasted four hours, that be the point. Ah, that sort of be what you were shooting for in some way. But in our business again our side effect profile is very tolerable. Here's the other piece of news and I, I mean it seriously. You kill hardly anybody. I'm serious, I'm serious. Medicine is killing people left and right everyday. People can't seem to get enough of that shit. Uhm, and us we, we don't do that. Our outcomes are really very good and they are comparable with the most medical procedures. Let me give you one more example of this just in case you're wondering. Most of you this morning when you got up, I know, on your way to the conference I'm imagining the-- and the person next to you is hoping you brush your teeth. Now, in toothpaste there is a variety of flavors and ways they dispense toothpaste and colors and grit and everything else. But really there's only one active ingredient, that ingredient is fluoride, that's exactly right. Now, here's the cool part about your work. Psychotherapy has an effect size, it is four times larger than the effect size of fluoride in the prevention of dental care. Are you amazed? You should be, you should put yourself in a tube this what you should do. You know, every morning people wake up and they pop out and they say hi-- we say "How the hell are you anyway?" ah, really. What we do really works, it works really quite well, it's on par with the most medical procedures and in fact let's take a look at the third finding here. 

00:09:00
THE EVIDENCE • In most studies of treatment conducted over the last 40 years, the average treated person is better off than 80% of the untreated sample. • The outcome of behavioral health services equals and, in most cases, exceeds medical treatments. • On average, mental health professionals achieve outcomes on par with success rates obtained in randomized clinical trials (with and without co-morbidity).

00:09:00
SCOTT D. MILLER On average, mental health professionals, that's real people. I'm not talking about rarefied studies done in academic centers but real mental health professionals achieve outcomes on par with success rates obtained in tightly controlled randomized clinical trials. Now I want you to think about how important that is because RCTs are being used to guide practice at the present time, to create lists in various countries including the United States about which treatments are deemed evidence-based and therefore approved for payment. Am I making sense to you? And your outcomes are already there. When you compare the outcomes of the field in general our outcomes are in par with randomized clinical trials. And again the cool part is you're often working with a clientele that is much more, shall we say, messy than those who seen in randomized clinical trials. In randomized clinical trials even though we've made progress and we have made progress we have to admit, our researchers have made progress, even though we've made progress we're including more and more studies with comorbidity. Uhm, still our s-- many of the studies that come out suffer from diagnostic singularity. What do I mean by that? They test clients that have a single problem. Now think about that. You think about this, let me just ask you, have you ever met a client? Does anyone in your family only have a single problem? It's kind of amazing when you think about it that they get research grants for this stuff. And yet when you're meeting with clients you're are working-- think of somebody, by the way, think of somebody who did come in and say, "You know, I only have problem." Think of somebody, think of that. Think of they did come in and they said you know I just have one. That's it. Yeah, just one problem-- I'm just depressed, that's all. Just depressed, yeah. How your finances? Great, yeah. Yeah. I have more money than I know how to do it, you know. Family, loving and supportive, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Any criminal history? No. What? Do you see criminals here? Oh, I'm not coming back. How about drug and alcohol? No, no, no, you know, I have occasional glass of wine but no, not really, think about this. Think about if this company somebody come here and said you know, I'm just depressed, that's it. And, ah, it's started last Tuesday, ah, by the way. Some getting kind of worried about it. Ah, I'll hope you can help me out, these are the kinds of clients that, yeah, they got academics, get to work with not true with you. Ah, you're working with messy clients and once again on average, we, mental health professionals achieve outcomes on par with success rates obtained and tightly controlled randomized clinical trials. What you do works? I want you to hang on to that, in fact, will you do me all the favor? Would you turn to the person next to you, stretch out your hand, shake their hand, pat them on the shoulder and say, "Damn good job." Would you do that? Now, I don't say this kind of thing just to be funny. I mean it because where we're going in this presentation is going to be challenging from here on. Ah, so hang on to this particular feeling and I'm gonna have to remind you because it can become discouraging, ah, what I'm about to say. We do have very good results. Again, take a look at those results. We do have very good results. Here is the problem with our results. Over the last 40 years, the same 40-year period researchers have tested and look for, ah, improvements in our work and here's what they found, there is no improvement. 

00:12:20
No Improvement Duncan, B., Miller, S., Wampold, B., & Hubble, M. (eds.) (2009). The Heart and Soul of Change: Delivering What Works. Washington, D.C.: APA Press.

SCOTTDMILLER.COM International Center for Clinical Excellence 

00:12:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Absolutely zero, no improvement in treatment outcomes over the same-- all the way back to 1976 in the first meta-analytic research by Smith and Glass fast forward to 2013, uhm, and the latest meta, meta-analytic research if you look at the overall effect sizes the outcomes are exactly the same. No improvement, none, zero, zip, nada. Now, think about that 1976, 1976, now I'm looking out here in the audience and I'm thinking there are few people in this room that weren't born in 1976. Am I right about that? Yeah, I knew I am. The rest of you, think what you were wearing in 1976. You're still showing up for work in those same clothes, driving that same car. Remember 1976, no desktop computer. No mobile pho-- here's how you dialed your phone, do you remember this? We thought that was a big advance when you let like this that was amazing. And you still had to get the extension on your chord, that was long distance. 

00:13:20
UNKNOWN Yeah.

Therapists No Improvement 

00:13:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Right? In fact, remember long distance we've given up this idea that there is such a thing. Flat rate calling, etcetera are outcomes of not improve and it's really very scary if you think about it. So, how could that be especially when you compare us for example to, ah, say, ah, athletes. You know, I have no sound now in my computer, now, there we go, there we go beautiful I don't want to be without the sound effects here. Over the last and if you can compare us to say athletes. Over the last century the best performance for every single Olympic event, every single one has improved. In some cases by more than 50% and I'm not just talking about 100-meter run here or the various swimming competitions. I'm also talking about the beer stein carrying event. All of them have improved in some cases by 50%. Us? Nothing. It's strange when you think about it. In fact, take a look at this right up here, when you think, ah, that today's best high school running time in the marathon beat the 1908, Olympic gold medal winning time by more than 20 minutes. In other words, we are as a group running faster. Us as a profession? No improvement, none, zero, zip, nada. We're not getting any better, ah, at what we do. In the tour to treatment we are riding on a stationary bike. We are pedaling like mad and we may look svelte at the end but we all we really are is sweaty and the scenery hasn't changed. It's exactly the same as it's have been for the last 40 years and that's pretty discouraging when you think about it, we have not-- now, we-- I think it was two years ago and I don't quote me to this, I could be wrong about this. Two years ago or three, uhm, a 74-year-old man I was get part of this wrong. A 74-year-old man beat the 1912, in the Chicago marathon, beat the 1912 gold medal winning time by four minutes. Us? No one improvement. It's amazing when you think about it and the troubling. Let's compare us to another group here, ah, and that is, ah, here we go back to the slides there he go. Ah, that is ballerinas. Take a look here, ah, about the same time period we, as a professional, have been researching developing models etcetera. Look back at the 1962, here we have a standard po-- position. Arabesque, those of you who did ballet you remember this. Step, toe, step, arabesque, remember that stuff? 1962 all the way forward to 2003, look at the leg extension of these ballerinas. Look, it's a near linear appro-- improvement year after year in that particular area in field. Us? No improvement, none, zero, zip, nada and the question really is why? How could so many of us others work so hard, trained so much, pay such grand sums to learn what this particular filed abhor, even spend times in conferences, listening lectures drawn on and come so little distance. So, here's what I would like you to do. I would like you for a moment turn to that neighbor that you just shook their hand and congratulate it. And I would act-- like you to ask them to explain themselves. How is it that you are no better than you were when you started? I mean that's pretty sad when you think about. It's very sad. I want you to turn to your neighbor and explain and then would you please make a note because I'll ask for some of these back in moment. I'd like you to make a note of what excuse, reasons they come with for why they haven't gotten better. I'm just gonna give you 30 seconds maybe 45 seconds, turn your neighbor have a chat there. 

00:17:05
[sil.] 

00:17:05
THE EVIDENCE ? 

00:17:45
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. Let me stop you here and ask what did you come up with. Give me, give me a hand and shout it out . Yes, right up here in front. 

00:17:55
UNKNOWN I really thought that as a trainee I was much better than when I became licensed. 

00:18:00
SCOTT D. MILLER You really thought that as a trainee you beca-- you were much better than you are now that your licensed? 

00:18:05
UNKNOWN Yes. Yes, because, because I listen to my client. 

00:18:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Because you listen to your clients. 

00:18:10
UNKNOWN We got a lot of curiosity. 

00:18:10
SCOTT D. MILLER You were curious. 

00:18:10
UNKNOWN And I wasn't judgmental. 

00:18:15
SCOTT D. MILLER And you were in judgmental. Now, that you're professional you can do all those things. 

00:18:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:18:20
SCOTT D. MILLER It reminds of a joke by the way. Do you wanna hear it? There are these two psychologists and they're showing up for work and there was a young one and an older-- an elderly one and the elderly one and they look very nice. It's the beginning of the day, they're walking into their office, they bid each other, "Hello." They go into their offices and they spend all day meeting clients. At the end of the day the young psychologist comes out in a short tails are pulled out and his hair is all messed up and he's walking out at the end of the day. Meanwhile, he meets the elderly psychologist psychiatrist who walks out, his hair is an exactly the same perfectly quaffed position it was before, he looks fabulous and the young psychologist looks at him and says, "My God! Look at you, how can you manage to listen to their stories hour after hour and come out looking so wonderful?" And the elderly psychiatrist says, "What?" So, maybe we are different as trainees, it could be part of the issue. Any other ideas? Yes, again right in front. 

00:19:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. Maybe the research hasn't been captured. 

00:19:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Maybe the research hasn't captured to how effective we become. I love this. Who, who said, who said it's only clients who live in denial? All right. Yes. Right back here. 

00:19:40
UNKNOWN I think that all those other platforms - 

00:19:40
THE EVIDENCE ARABESQUE PENCHEE Leg elevation (deg) DEVELOPPE A LA SECONDE Leg elevation (deg) 

00:19:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Yes. 

00:19:45
UNKNOWN - (inaudible ). 

00:19:46
SCOTT D. MILLER So all the other categories are more singular and we are more complex and so if you control for the complexity we had actually doing better. It's a really smart argument, here is the issue. In this studies they've actually made sure to compare like to like. Equally serious to equally serious from year to year. They have controlled for severity and the outcomes basically stay the same and in some areas I'll tell you the outcomes are slightly worse than they were 20, 30 years ago. Way at the back will do one more. Yes, go ahead. Go ahead, yes, yes. Maybe we fall in the clinical habits, we're creatures of habit and then we just don't manage to get better overtime. It's sort of an interesting idea as well. Ah, none of it really excuses our bad behavior, it may explain it. Ah, in, in some way, well, let's go back to the presentation here, ah, a little bit. You've been asking yourselves why aren't we getting better, uhm, and so you've given some ideas here. 

00:20:45
THE EVIDENCE ? •A massive, 20-year, multinational study of 11,000 therapists; •Collected and analyzed detailed reports about the way therapists experienced their work and professional development.

New York: Cambridge University Press. INTERNATIONAL CENTER for CLINICAL EXCELLENCE •The majority of therapists s themselves as developing professionally over the course of their careers. 

00:20:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Let's take a look at a-- some, some of the research evidence. This is a study done by one of my mentors, ah, gentleman by the name of David Orlinsky, one of the prime-- of primary researchers, outcome researchers in our field at the University of Chicago, really an incredible person, contributed all of the versions of the handbook of psychotherapy and behavior change. Uhm, and he, together with Rønnestad, who is a Norwegian researcher, uhm, very well known in that country and worldwide conducted this massive study, massive study, ah, multinational study of 11,000 therapists, it was a big job. They track these therapists, ah, over a long period 20, 20-year period collect and analyze detailed reports about the way these therapists experience their work and their professional development. So, they were looking at how we see ourselves and whether or not we develop, ah, overtime. Would you like to see what he found? Okay, here we go. Here's what they-- here's what they, they found that the majority of therapists see themselves as developing professionally over the course of their careers, that we actually do see ourselves as developing. You know, the problem is, is that it's just really no evidence that, that's what we do as a matter of fact. Again if you look at our outcomes overtime, our outcomes stay relatively flat and again the question is why? How come we don't get much better over the course of our careers. 

00:22:15
THE EVIDENCE How Do Therapists Develop? •The effectiveness of the "average" helper plateaus very early. Performance Expert Performance Arrested Development Everyday Skills Experience 

00:22:15
SCOTT D. MILLER In fact, here's what the work seems to say. The work seems to say that the effectiveness of the average helper plateaus very early in their careers. Would you like to know how early? 

00:22:30
UNKNOWN No. 

00:22:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Are you ready? 

00:22:30
UNKNOWN No.

00:22:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Are you sure? Here we go. Fifty hours of direct service. Yeah. And then its plateau after that, now you-- from the laughter in the room it's very clear that this conflicts with our perceived self, the way we see ourselves as developing getting by-- and let me just ask come on let me ask. Truthfully speaking now, how many of you by show of hands feel like you're, except you, feel like you are a better at this than when you first started? Come on, yeah, yeah. And those of you are raising your hand you are a liar. You're lying. You think you are because, "Oh going to be the humble one in the room full of arrogant idiots." No, no. You, you wa-- do we see ourselves as developing but the data is, ah, leaves us to-- the feeling perhaps less sanguine about that. If we can go back to the slides again here, the effectiveness of the average helper plateaus very early. And in fact, there appears to be little or no difference in outcome between professionals, students and para-professionals. Now, let that sink in of it. Let that sink in because this just doesn't have implications for us. It also has implications for our clients and for payment systems. If systems of care can't tell the difference between us and minimally trained para-professionals, why should we get the big box? And right now, you probably know there is a huge movement. I'm not arguing against it, I'm just talking about the trend here towards peer supports and peer counselors. They are in many places re-- replacing fully licensed MSWs, MFTs and Ph.Ds, they are in the process and their argument has to be why not? They're doesn't seem to be a whole heck of a lot difference we can show in terms of our outcome. Now I told you this what get discouraging. 

00:24:25
THE EVIDENCE How Do Therapists Develop? •The effectiveness of the "average" helper plateus very early. • Little or no difference in outcome between professionals, students and para-professionals. •The Stubborn Problems •Drop out rates average 47%; •Mental health professionals frequently fail to identify failing cases; •1 out of 10 consumers accounts for 60-70% of expenditures. 

00:24:25
SCOTT D. MILLER The whole peer is in a Calvinistic way to get you to do something about it if you haven't figure that out, ah, ah, at the moment. Let's go back to the slides again here, that little or no difference in outcome between professionals and para-professionals, this is research that goes back 10, 15, 20 years. And there are a couple of other stubborn facts about our field now hang with here. Here are some stubborn troubling facts. Number one, our dropout rates in mental health in general average about 47%, 47%. In other words, we do great work with the people who stay, that's right. But half of our customers decide early on "I'd rather be mentally ill than be forced to meet with you one more time." Think how troubling that is. That's very troubling, 47% of our customers dropout before achieving a reliable improvement in their functioning. No other business could survive this really if you think about it. We'll come to that a little bit later. Forty-seven percent dropout rate, uhm, and if you're working in with the children's population even higher on average. Ah, number two, mental health professionals frequently failed to identify failing cases. We don't think we fail to identify failing cases. The research suggest that we do. Ah, the last time this was looked at, was by a researcher by the name of Hanen. Here's what Hanen did, ah, in, in, in general terms. He basically assigned about, ah, 500 clients to 25 different therapist and he charged them with one task and one task only in addition to doing their regular clinical job. And that was he said, "Tell me which of your clients get worst while you working with them?" That was it just tell me which clients are getting worst deteriorating in your care. He then used a measurement tool to track the clients at every single visit and the therapist did their work. Now-- oh, one other piece I forgot to tell you about. He also told them what the average rate of deterioration is in our field. It's a very robust figure, it goes back-- again about two and a half decades that figure is 10%. Approximately 10% of the people we start with end up worst off than they were when they started. Now, you may feel bad about that, that's why I love about therapists guilty consciences, right? But you shouldn't feel bad. To compare it to medicine, it's walking on water, ah, in terms of side effects. Again, you hardly kill anybody. Ah, medicine is killing people left and right. Uhm, 10%, 10% so if, if you do some simple math you figure out that out of the 500 that means there should have been 50 cases if the average is held. In this study, there were 40 deteriorated cases, do the math? About an 8% deterioration rate, 40. Therapist's job where to identify which of the ones were getting worse, therapist identified out of the 40 exactly one correctly, one. We are a terminally and forever hopeful group of people. We think people are gonna change right up to the moment they don't come back. And then we go, "Damn, you know, we almost had them this time," all right. We just don't "hmm, hmm," see this thing coming. We don't see clients deteriorating, we don't see clients at risk for dropping out, we just don't see it. Ah, and, and, and you may be sitting in the audience thinking I don't have, ah, clients that dropout. Most of my client stayed. That as well is double-edged sword. If you're helping them great, if you're not well that's not such good news which leads to finding number three on the slides and that is one out of 10 consumers ends up accounting for 60 to 70% of the expenditures in behavioral services here in the U.S. Let that sink in again. About one out of 10 consumers accounts for 60 to 70% of the expenditures in behavioral services in the United Sates. Let me just ask, do you know the people who I referring to you here? Uhmm. These are your frequent flyer clients, I'm serious. These are the clients have truth be told you wish would dropout but they won't. They just keep coming back every week and you say, "Am I helping you?" And they say, "Every week." Every week and these clients collect like plaque on the arteries of the treatment system and they don't let go. I'm not making this up, this actual research. Two researchers back in the 1980s, Steinberger(ph) and Howard. They were looking at roughly the same-- this same phenomenon, how non-progressing clients collect on clinicians' case loads in an agency settings. And what this at-- what happens? That means it creates a bottleneck at the entry point. Let it sink in. We have fewer clients leaving them coming in, this is a recipe for waiting list etcetera. So, they did a couple of studies, they didn't know that they were researching essentially the same topic with, ah, one another. Here's what they did, they took newly minted social workers. Newly minted social workers showing up their first day on the job. Now, think back to your first day at the agency, remember that day. Remember that, think about that, think about that how full of hope you were, you know, you hadn't grown into a cynical person yet, about change etcetera. You hadn't attended the advanced training for people who don't know what to do next, right. You hadn't. You were there and showed up the first day. You had your diploma, remember that? With its wall mark frame, remember that? You had your Freud's lunchbox, you know. You're coming in you looking at all the other lunchboxes around, see who might be sympathical(ph) with me. That very first day-- they, they had, of course, you starting zero clients and zero experience. Imagine this as a grid, zero clients and zero experience. They were gonna track these clinicians over an 18-month period to find out how these clinicians develop a caseload. Well, in the beginning if you been in this position you know exactly what happens. They found that the new therapists, the new clinicians inherited about 20% of their cases within a week of starting. Do you remember that? These are the clients that have been at the agency forever. Nobody can remember where they came from, why they started, what they want. Their records come in a truck. Peep, peep, peep, peep, peep. And the clients are passed down like a family bible or watch. This is the Jones family, they're some of our first clients. Help this found with the agency. They're now your responsibility. Do you remember this? Twenty percent. That leaves you 80% of your time to take in new cases, new clients. It's also why when you showed up that first week all the experienced therapists had that look on their face, this look. Yeah. Glad your here. Yeah, part of the team now. And for every 10 clients you took in, one stays. Ten more come in, one stays. Ten more come in one stays. Ten more come in-- are you getting the picture here? And with an 18 man-- months rather, in 18 months that 20-80 pattern, 20 taken 80 free turns in to an 80-20 pattern. Eighty percent of your time taking managing clients that are going sideways or that we say need long term ineffective treatment. About 20% of our time now is open and available. And by that time you've learned how to avoid new cases at the agency. When somebody says we have new clients, somebody goes, woo, woo, woo I'm very busy, I'm very busy, bring in the students, all right. Hopefully they can help us solve this particular problem. In our past we have solved this issue of bottlenecks in one way, and I would call that management fiat. We pass rules and regulations. In times of economic plenty which at least in the United States we are not in at the present time. In times of economic plenty we hire more clinicians and we expand programming. We have lots of special programming, we have a depression program for women. Right, ah, we have lots of specialized program. However, when the faucet runs dry we have another management fiat and we begin passing rules that really make no clinical sense like you get five visits. You get five visits and we make the acceptance criteria in our specialized programs more and more difficult to pass through. Are you with me? So now we have a depression program for women, ah, who were once nuns and missing their big toe. Oh, you have all your toes consider yourself fortunate, right? It gets harder and harder when really what we need to do is identify those clients that are not getting better, so that we can in fact do something else. Clients at risk for dropping out clients at risk for continuing without improvement, am I making my point? If we can extend our reach some because remember despite everything I said, our outcomes are really quite good. Then the area we may need to reach further is keeping people who need care and would benefit in treatment and getting people to another service or treatment when what I'm doing or what we are isn't working. Am I making sense about this? This is the whole idea of extending our reach looking to the inefficiency. So, I guess I should say the following. You've actually all made the Olympic trials. The question for us as a field now is, gold, silver or bronze or nothing and few people really remember anything else about the Olympics. Will we get there, can we get there, uhm, is the question.

THE EVIDENCE Average is over "In the past, workers with average skills, doing an average job, could earn an average lifestyle. But today average is officially over. Being average just won't earn you what it used to. It can't when so many more employers have access to so much more above average, inexpensive labor..." REACH •Specific Models and Methods 

00:35:45
SCOTT D. MILLER And so, here, is what, ah, Tom Friedman, ah, the, ah, Pulitzer Prize winning author, the author of the Earth Is Flat, uhm, wrote in a New York Times editorial about, a little over a year ago, uhm, I was in Denmark doing some work and reading the, ah, Herald-Tribune, uhm, open the page and this was the article that they were. He said, "Average is over." Now of course Friedman it wasn't talking about mental health professionals, he was talking a global phenomenon which, if you haven't noticed, we've been caught up in and that global phenomenon said leads to the following. He says, "Average is over. In the past workers with average skills doing an average job could earn an average lifestyle. But today average is officially over. Being average just won't earn you what it used to. It can't when so many more employers have access to" and if I could pull this down I-- it says, "So much more inexpensive and cheap but highly effective labor." Are you with me here? We're not trying to outrun the, ah, the regular folks, we're trying outrun ourselves in many ways. Ah, competing with ourselves, how can we do that? Well, here's an idea about what, ah, we can do if we can go back to the slides, we need to reach. Reach further than what we've done before in the past. Again, the question is, what could we reach for? So, let me just say, that if I look at my own development as a clinician back all the way to 1985 when I attended the first Evolution Conference and wore a red hat, volunteered, sat at the back and watched people talk about what was important in our filed. The thing that I got in my head was it was important to learn a model of therapy and there was a lot of choices about that, uhm, many, many choices, ah, to-- for a specific model and method and that's what I did. I learned a particular method, I learned it very well. Ah, the method that I happened to be involved in was the solution focused therapy and work with Steve de Shazer and Insoo Berg in a city of Milwaukee for about five years and then something troubling happened. Here's what it was. We invited researchers in to take a look at the work that we were doing. One from Calvin College, ah, in Michigan and the other from Texas Women's University and they were going to follow up with our clients to find out just how effective we actually work. They ran the numbers, they contacted the clients, they did the follow up and here's what they found, the good news first, we were effective. The bad news is no more effective than any other approach. No more brief than any other approach. No more fewer dropouts than any other approach, we were exactly the same. This is like toothpaste. It all works the same. I love this ad for Crest. Do you remember the ad for Crest? It goes like this, "No toothpaste fights cavities better than Crest." Let that sink in. What it's really saying is Crest is as shitty as the rest and I think my phrase is a little more catchy, really. It's not any better than anything else which I have to tell you if you've worked very hard learning the model or developing a model is a very dissatisfying place to find yourself in. Would you agree? We don't come by our training for free. Both in terms of money and time, we invest the great deal. What happened of the team? It blew up right around this issue. What we were saying didn't seem to get us where we needed to go. We wanted our clients to be better than what they would be had we not developed this particular ideas. 

00:39:25
REACH •Specific Models and Methods •Common factors •Measurement of Outcomes •Expertise and Excellence 

00:39:25
SCOTT D. MILLER So we moved on. And where did we go? We move to common factors. We started talking about common factors, factors that were in common with all treatment models and here was our idea, our idea and we thought the idea was so fantastic that was since there was no difference between different treatment models and there isn't despite what you hear. Since there is no difference and outcome between models maybe if we focused on the factors they all shared we've be able to improve our outcomes. Good. We research this and then one day we're all talking about it and Mark Hubble, one of my co-authors made the following observations. He said, "Wait the minute, if all models work because of the common factors, why learn the common factors? Why not just stick with your model? Do you get it?" That meant we all went, "Geez! Why didn't you say that 10 years ago?" It was a very dispiriting finding, a very dispiriting thought plus people ask us how do you the common factors? It would refer us right back to the specific models. There was no reason to learn common factors. And so as a team starting in about 1999, ah, we changed directions again, and here's what we said, "You know what? Who knows how this whole thing works, this psychotherapy thing? We do know that it works." And so maybe all we should do is start measuring our outcomes. Each of us begin measuring our outcomes, that's what I'm gonna talk in part about on Friday that my peers how to measure our outcomes. And so we did start measuring our outcomes and what did we find. We found something quite curious and also a bit unnerving. We found that some therapists routinely achieved better outcomes than others. Now, that is not a comfortable finding. And it didn't seem to have much to do with their age, their gender, their experience level, the types of people they were seem, how difficult those clients were. Routinely and consistently they achieved better outcomes. We didn't know how to understand this. So here's what our team did. We started watching videotapes of them work and here's what we found, I would watch these tapes and would I-- I'm serious, here was my reaction, "This is shit. It's not elegant, it's not nice, why don't they do this technique? That technique?" But you couldn't argue with the effects. Are you following me? But we could figure out from watching this video what the hell they were doing in the room, maybe they were feeding people something before or after, we didn't know. We couldn't figure it out. Maybe that's because we were idiots ourselves or something and it was very discouraging. For awhile we said, "Ah, these people, they're just random, they're results will eventually go down. Everybody's great for a short while. We just have to track them further," not true. When we adjusted the baseline performance levels, equalized all the outcomes amongst all of the participants in our studies, those therapists continue excel. Are you with me here? And we thought there must be a clue. How is it that they got better and I just happened to be riding on a plane, ah, as I've said, I swear I spend a lot of my time, I don't know if you've had this experience I was stuck in the middle seat and it was like an 11-hour flight home from Israel or something. Ah, and I'm stuck in the middle seat and you, you can't eat anymore and you're so tired and you've seen the movie and you're just sitting there and, and you can't, you know, nothing is-- nothing won't make you happy. And you-- and I opened up the little sleeve and I pulled out a magazine. It's a magazine I'd never read Fortune magazine. I don't read it for obvious reasons. Ah, and you know, the, the feel. It's just right on fortune underneath the mass that says it's not for therapists. Ah, but I opened up this magazine and, and I start reading some of the articles and thinking about what if I'd chosen another profession? Ah, what I might do and then I come across this article by a guy name K. Anders Ericsson. K. Anders Ericsson is the experts on expertise. You may never have heard of this person, he's been doing research as a psychologist in the United States and in Sweden for the last three decades. Studying all sorts of people athletes, musicians, financial people, computer programmers, teachers, etcetera, trying to understand why some within each group are experts at what they do while the rest of us remain sadly average. Are you with me here? I'd never read anything like it, he summarized his work in this massive tome called the Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance, 896 double column, 10 point font pages and if you have a sleeping problem, this book is a phenomenal resource. Just open it up and it is like riding-- reading the book of numbers out of the bible, it's an instant snooze, ah, and if really in the pages don't put you to sleep then you can just hit yourself with the book in the head. It's the half of it, it so massive you'll be unconscious for a week. In any event reading his work was enlightening, he'd been looking at top performers for 30 years and identifying what was different about them and here's what he found that was so intriguing. Across domains of expertise teaching, metal work, wood working, leather craft, surgery, etcetera, there was a very a common thing these folks did. It's just that it wasn't very sexy or interesting, ah, really. What was that thing he did? 

00:45:15
REACH An Experiment 

00:45:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, you know, he-- in essence was looking at, uhm, ah, what people did before and after the work that they did, not during. We were looking within the frame, psychotherapy, looking for a model that we could replicate like a virus so that all of us could do the same thing. That's the promise of most models, is it not? Copy my procedures and you'll get better outcomes, uhm. I say show me the data, show me the data. We've invested 40 years, millions of human hours and time and money without, without achieving much, ah, over that period of time. So here's what I'd like to do. I'd like you to experience more than you me-- having me just tell you what Ericsson found. Uhm, so if I can have my slide back I'm gonna-- I'm gonna ask you to engage with me in an experience. Uhm, in a moment I'm going to show a picture. Now, if you've seen this picture before I'd just ask you do take a look, be quite don't say anything. I doubt you've seen it but if you have, take a look, be quiet. Uhm, in this picture there are sheep and what I would like you to do is count the number of sheep in the picture. Now, when you look at the picture, unfortunately, it's not going to be up there long enough to actually count them in the usual way in a, remember this word, deliberate fashion. You're going to have to do what you do in your office on a day by day basis with your clients, guess. Does this sound familiar? Now remember our guess has usually lead to good results, are you with me here? Except when they don't. And the problem is when our guesses don't work we often think they did work and we stick with that same idea. This is what Kahneman in his fabulous book Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow. Have you read this? Oh, my gosh, this is a book, don't go to the bookstore and buy my book, I'm serious. Buy Kahneman's book and other, and other Nobel Prize winning psychologist called Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow. I believe it will change your life and your work. He identifies two systems, two ways of two cognitive systems. Number one-- system one is, ah, it operates automatically, it's how we walk, it's how we talk. Think about if you had to monitor every word before you said it. If you're here from out of the country and English isn't our second language, you know what I'm talking about, you have to think of every word. 

00:47:55
REACH How Many Sheep? 

00:47:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Now you stay here whole week and suddenly you'll become more fluid and fluid. Am I making sense? More system one, we love, as a species, we love system one because then we can relax, right? We don't have to do shit because it's gonna happen no matter what we do. The problem is were on system one all the time. When, in fact, sometimes we need to be in system two which is conscious and deliberate. Are you with me here? Now, you can't be in system two all the time otherwise people won't stay around to talk with you. They'll wanna get away from you because you seems like something's wrong with you, seriously wrong. So, the question is how do we find out when to be in system two. Are you with me here? And we get in the system one very, very fast. I'm gonna show you a little experiment about that in a minute. But first this picture. I'm gonna have you look at this picture and try to guess how many sheep are in the picture and I know you are not a sheep farmers but what I'd like you to do is write down the number, just write down the number on a piece of paper and please do not turn to the person next to you and say, blah, blah, don't say the answer. Do not say anything to the person next to you, just write down the number, are you ready for this? The pictures going to be up there for about three seconds. Here we go, one, two. Write down your number. How many sheep were in the picture? How many sheep were in the picture? Does anyone need more time? So, let me just ask how many of you said 16? Okay, take a look around the room, 17, 18, 19, one, two, three, 20, oh, my. Twenty-three, 22, 24, let's go the other way. Fifteen, look we got more hands, 14, 13, 12, lots of 12, 11, now wait a second here. I don't know if you've noticed this but your guess and all the hell all over the place. Basically, what you're guessing is not like that. I think it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. One person up here said zero. I say, you got to open your eyes and see the picture. This is a fairly simple task, just try to and do it number sheep were going 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, blah-blah-blah. Now, let me ask you or let me just say, the actual number was 16. Who feels good about themselves right now? And look I got more hands this is just like Woodstock thing here. I got more hands and yeah, I was 16. I do, I was 16. Now, those of you who were think 15 or 17 you're going, hey, I was close. All right. We usually get a big bumped at 12 I'm not exactly sure why, uhm, but the actual number was 16. Now, here's my question, here's my question. Does anybody, don't shout it loud but does anybody in the room-- did anybody else have a feeling that there was something else about this picture. So just by show of hands, anybody have a feeling that there was something else, okay. Now, can anybody actually put and you don't say that out loud-- can anybody actually put a name to that what they felt funny about. So, Al what's the funny thing? You think you saw a wolf and sheep's clothing. Now, let me just ask Al, did anybody else see a wolf in sheep's clothing? Oh look, look, oh, wait a second Al, Al, is not alone. Al is not alone. There are five or six or seven people, ah, eight, nine, 10 people who saw this. Now, I don't know how many people in the room right now, I'm, I'm guessing about 800, 900 people and we got about 10 people going, ah, there's a wolf in there. There's a wolf in there, the rest of us are going one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Can we have the slides back one more time, let's take a look here, uhm, in fact. 

00:52:35
UNKNOWN Oh. 

00:52:40
SCOTT D. MILLER You see in here? Yeah. Now, here is my point. It is possible to see more than what most see. Do you get it? And the best therapist manage to see slightly more than the rest of us. Now, let me just make one another point. If a wolf is in your office, it's probably a good thing to notice. As opposed to going one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Think about that. It's amazing. And my point here is it is possible to see but most of us didn't, why? We were in system one, we were stuck, that's what we were seeing and to the people who saw it, to the people saw it if we get on my slides back come again it actually seems obvious to them. Quite often effect, it's looks like this to them. They're thinking God can't you guy see it, I mean it sitting right there this is what we noticed about experts they would see things. You probably had this experience when you were student and you had, ah, ah, mentor as a clinician. A mentor who said, "Did you noticed this?" and you go, "Oh, my God that's right." I can't believe I missed it. And you see many more things than others. At the same time in order to be able to improve we're going to have to see more. Are you following me? It 's going to have to be just as obvious as it was to Al and the other folks in the room and it is possible, it is possible. Most of us don't, but it is possible to push our performance to the next level. The question is what do we need to do in order to do that and the answer is we need to move out of system one. And system one is so compelling. In fact all I had to do was structure this in a-- in a-- in a very simple way and most of us were blind to what was in the picture. So, let me in fact show you one of you-- one other little experiment with you. Uhm, ah, just to show you how fast system one can get into operation. So, the effect of this is going to be most profound for people sort of in the center, ah, of the room. Maybe I don't know can we zoom in on this a little bit? Oh, very good. Now, this-- oh, that's perfect, right there it's perfect. Now, you-- just make a choice now whether you gonna watch mine or you're gonna watch the, the one on the screen up here it doesn't really matter. Uhm, here's what I'd like you to do and this is not hypnosis. I am not going to do, you're not going to go and you have not. You're not, I promise that's not what it is about. Uhm, but I promise if you do what I'm about to engage you in you will have an experience not like anything since you stop taking drugs. Okay? So, what I would like you to do is stay focus right here on the center and I'm going to spin this. I'm going to spin it for 30 seconds. You will be tempted to look away. I'm asking you to stay focus on the center after 30 seconds which all count out in my head, ah, I'm going to count from one to 10 at when I get the 10 I'm going to ask to do one more thing, instructions clear? System one is what we're talking about and we're going start right now. Just stay focus on the center, don't look away no matter how tempting it is, just stay focus on the center you were not going to go into trends, just stay focused on the center. Don't look away. Stay focused on the center, don't look away. Stay focus on the center don't look away. I'm counting in my head but you stay focus in the center. Stay focus in the center don't look away. Getting close, stay focused on the center. Almost there, stay focused on the center, don't look away, I'm gonna begin to count from one to 10. Stay focused on the center, one, two, three, four, stay focus on the center, six, seven, eight, stay focused on the center, nine and 10, look at my head.

THE BEST AND THE REST Know More See More Do more THE BEST HAVE MORE DEEP, DOMAIN-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE THAN THE REST 

00:57:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Did you see it? Let me just tell you my head did not get bigger no matter what you think. This happened in your head. So quickly are we able to get stock in system one habituate to the world around us something is to happen so we can move out of that system one process and what is that particular process? Well, it's something that top performers do. The best performers, the best no more, see more and can do more. Let me give you a couple examples like promise were gonna drill down to our fields, psychotherapy. Uhm, the-- for example master tennis players, let me just ask you a question don't say it out loud let's-- I'll, I'll ask you for a vote. Master tennis players along the baseline waiting to receive service. When do they start adjusting in receive of the serve? I'm gonna give you three a choices, don't shout it out. Three choices number one, the ball-- opponent's ball is in their hand, the, ah, the racket is at their side. Number two, the racket is just moving a bit and the ball is just starting to leave the hand, number three, the ball is out of the hand and the racket is up. When do they adjust along baseline? A in the hand, B just leaving the hand, the racket just beginning to move, C out of the hand, the racket coming up to hit the ball, A , B, C , let's take a vote. Who says A? Who says B? Who says C? 

00:59:05
[sil.] 

00:59:10
SCOTT D. MILLER We've got people voting in every group, ah, it's, it's just reading, the answer is A. A if, if-- when you're playing that level of tennis. If you wait to the ball leaves the hand at all. It--they serve so fast it's impossible to adjust to receive serve. Now you may be thinking why the hell can you know that? How can you-- how-- they don't-- the top performer see clues the rest of us don't, are you with me? Number two is NICU nurses a neonatal intensive care units, there are people Ericsson studied, nurses that manage to see blood disorders, blood infections, prior to the blood work showing that there is an infection. How do they do it? They see it before the test come back. They see a pattern that the rest of us don't see. And last but not the least are skilled typist. Uhm, at some point shear physics makes an impossible for your fingers to move any faster. So, how is it that certain typist can type so much faster than the rest? Ericsson found it's because they read 50 to 80% further ahead on the page. Are you following me? They don't ever have to stop and look they are seem much further ahead than the rest of us. The question is how do they do it? How do they do this? How do they get this deep domain-specific knowledge? One more time. The best have a highly contextualized deep and domain-specific knowledge, they literally know and see and can do more than the rest. Thinking that information can be pass to you in a textbook is the problem. You can't get it out of a textbook because most of that information is far too vague and decontextualized to give you an edge. Are you with me here? What you have to engage in is a process that creates that deep domain-specific knowledge, I wanna make sure you're hearing me here. Let me say it one more time because this is the reaction I'm getting. All right, wake up here we go. You can't get deep domain-specific knowledge by reading a book or even by practicing you have to do something else before and after your work to create that deep domain-specific knowledge, engage in a process that creates the opportunity for the acquisition of domain-specific knowledge in your job, ah, or your work.

REACH How to Improve Performance How could a chess player in a club be able to keep improving? •Hours spent playing; •Active participation in tournaments; •Studying books

SCOTT D. MILLER So, let me ask you another question, A, B and C. And Norwegians are not allowed to answer this question. An there's a reason that all the Norwegians know and that's because the grand master-- the grand champion is now from Norway and he is how old? Is it 22, 21? Twenty-two, uhm, and will talk about how it is he manages to, to do this in any event, how can a chess player in a club be able to keep improving? Three choices, this is Ericsson's work and wait, wait, wait, please translate this to therapy. Think about what the equivalent would be in the therapy. So, number one how could a chess player in a club be able to keep improving? A, hours spent playing chess. In other words play more chess. B, active participation in chess tournaments, engage in contest where you find out are you winning or losing with your strategies. And C, studying books about chess. A, B, or C, let's take a vote right here in Anaheim. Are you ready for this? Who says, let's go back, A, hours spent playing chess. All right, we've got some hands. Who says B active participation in che-- now, look around the room. Active participation in chess tournaments. I'm trying to forgot exactly what the psychotherapy equivalent is of that. Is that going to supervision and saying, "Hahaha, I don't have any failing cases." I do-- I don't know think about it and C studying books about chess. Now, let me-- let me ask you sir at the back, are you a chess player? You are a chess player. The answer to this question let's take a look-- let's take a look here. Ah, back to hours spent playing chess is actually negatively correlative with performance. It's the same in psychotherapy. The more you do, the worse you get. So keep going. Think about that experience is not a reliable predictor of improvement. Experience is not, it's never been that finding we talked about earlier, recall, it's not been but you hear people say, "Oh, you have 20 years of experience and I think so you're not very good, are you?" Think about that number B, B active participation in chess tournaments is no correlation. That's what most of us voted for. You have to put your skills on display. Here's the problem, when you're in a contest just like when you're in your office-- and I guess you could sort of view that is a contest. Can I engage this person in something that might be helpful to them instead of the behavior they've engaged in the past? I guess you could view it like that. Here's the problem, you don't have enough time to rethink and reflect on your work at the time you're doing it. Are you with me? You can't, you have to go on auto pilot and every once in a while the client will be quiet long enough for you to squeeze in a thought. Otherwise they're just going, blah-blah-blah. And just try to think while I do that, blah-blah-blah, it's very hard, you can't possibly reflect enough to get better on your work even though a tournament likely shows your errors, ah, very easily. So the only thing and that's why I ask if this gentlemen back here was a chess player the only thing that is positively correlated with improving chess performance is studying books about chess. That's it. Why? Because both this in contrast to the prior two choices are things you have to do when you're not playing chess. You cannot get better at therapy while you're doing therapy period. You can't do it. You cannot get better at therapy by going to a workshop, period. You can't do it. You cannot and will not get better by learning a new therapy model especially if you don't know how effective you are right now. How can you improve, well, if you don't know where you're starting from. It just makes no sense, ah, when you think about it.

REACH •Research indicates that performers (math, science , sports, chess, etc.) reliant on general cognitive strategies or inference methods behave expertly on almost no tasks; •Similarly, available evidence shows that training clinicians in "evidence-based," manualized therapies, diagnosis, and even the alliance has little if any impact on outcome. 

01:05:25
SCOTT D. MILLER And in fact, uhm, if we go back research indicates, ah, this is Ericsson's research that performers in math, science, sports, chess, psychotherapy we've managed to chorale(ph) Anders Ericsson to work with us that are reliant on general cognitive strategies or inference methods behave expertly on almost no tasks. Now, let that sink in. What that essential means is that the level of model and you know this if you been in the field for a while. The level of model is far too decontextualized and abstract to help that person. You have to take that information and translate it into something meaningful for this person. And it's gonna be different for-- to from that person. Are you with me here? And we hope and the process we learn something but nowadays we're running so fast and so hard we hardly have any time to think about or talk about anything about our work when were not at work. It's, it's intriguing. So, ah, they be fe-- and so and that's the same in our field the available evidence shows that training clinicians in evidence-based manualized therapies, diagnosis and even the alliance has little, if any, impact on outcome. Why? It's decontextualized. It-- I'm not saying it doesn't get us the results we have, it did. Our results are very good, remember? The question is, how to get better? How to extend our reach and these ways of working are not likely to accomplish that in. So, where do we go? Where are we going to go if we don't do these things if, if we stay at that level.

01:07:00
SCOTT D. MILLER And Ericsson says, we have to engage in deliberate practice. Deliberate practice. Deliberate, conscious, systems two oriented reflecting about our work. Deliberate practice is the way that top performers extend their reach. The problem with this is it's not interesting and it's not sexy, it's painful and time consuming, etcetera but it is the thing that leads to improve performance in a variety of fields. And I'm happy at this event to be able to share with you research that has just been completed by our team led by a, ah, psychologist by the name of Daryl Chow who's in Singapore. And what we've done is look at the difference between average clinicians and top performing clinicians and applied Ericsson's methodology. Here's what Ericsson found that you all read about in a popular format by Malcolm Gladwell in his book Outliers. This is what his-- but it was completely based on Ericsson's work. Ericcson's work found, ah, they followed for example, ah, kids learning to play the violin for about a10, 10 or 11-year period. When the kid-- here's the critical part. When the kids started playing around age four around age five you can see the difference in their ability was indistinguishable, they were all the same. Teachers could not tell or look at the difference between them on standardized test of their ability. And then overtime, the groups begin to separate. And the question they had was why did some end up as world class players 17 years in, ah, to their, ah, to their musical study and Ericsson found out take a look here. The top group, these are in clean tiles, the top group here by the 17th or 16th year had practiced solo on their own outside of formal performances, they had put in about 7,000 hours studying and practicing solo. Take a look at the bottom, the bottom group here we had put in about-- let's give them a benefit of the doubt here about 500 hours. In other words the top had put in 12 times as many hours or more than the bottom group. Are you following me? Actually 14, correct? Yeah. Fourteen times, well, we wanted to find out about the same thing with therapist. After all we've watched their video tapes, I couldn't figure out what they were doing in the room. So, Daryl Chow does this massive study. He looks at the therapist first eight years of time in practice and what they did and at the same time we tracked their outcomes. We measure the outcomes of all of their clients over that same time period. And here's what we've found, take a look. Look at the graph. This is a graph that is divided into thirds. The top third, the top third, the middle third and the bottom third. And within the first 8 years the therapist, that's the squares, with the best outcomes, just follow it over, the therapist with the best outcomes had put in about 3500 hours. Coming down here to this group ri-- right here that could be put in about 50 hours in the first 8 years outside of work reflecting and studying. In other words about 14 times, are you with me here? It's shocking really when you think about it. What distinguished the best from the rest was their model, their gender, their skills level as rated by outside experts but rather how much time they spent outside of work thinking, planning, studying and reflecting on their work. And the best by 8 years had put in 14 times more. By the way, this probably is why many of us as we get older don't take up instruments because it's very hard to catch up. Now, Ericsson's work shows that you can learn virtually anything even a language, you may never get the dialect exactly right but you can learn the grammar perfectly almost at any age if you're willing to put in the time. That's it. But again the problem is who wants to hear that? Who wants to hear that shit? You mean I got to do shit at home? No. I want to practice at work. No, Ericsson's message is you have to practice outside of your practice. That's what it amounts to, it's a discouraging message in some ways. In other ways, it really freeze us up to do something else.

01:11:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Here's the issue, "Unlike play," Ericsson says, "deliberate practice is not inherently motivating and unlike work it does not lead to immediate social and monetary rewards actually generates costs." You can see why. You're having the study, get a coach, connect with people, take time away from family and friends, etcetera, am I making my point? It's a pain in the butt. And so the question is, why would anyone do it when average suffices? And the truth is average is no longer likely to suffice. Going forward, we are going to be-- those that survive, I'm guessing, will have to stand out with regard to their outcomes. It's just a guess. Of course, my crystal ball is as foggy as everyone else's. Uhm, but deliberate practice is not fog and I don't want to imply it's fogged. If you engage in it, well, you're probably gonna feel like this person right here. Let me just-- let me just, ah, let me just show this a bit of a-- of a video here, uhm, about what it's like.

DEEP, DOMAIN-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE •Researchers Anderson, Ogles, Lambert & Vermeersch (2009): •25 therapists treating 1100+ clients; •Variety of demographic variables; •Measure of interpersonal skills (SSI). •Domain-specific interpersonal knowledge tested by using therapist responses to challenging therapeutic interactions: •Four problematic therapeutic process segments; •Multiple challenging interpersonal patterns (e.g., angry, dependent, confused, blaming, controlling, etc.). 

01:15:15
SCOTT D. MILLER And then go off some place private and keep trying. Deliberate practice is frustrating, each of our team members picked up a hobby, ah, while we've approach this research trying to do something that we had never done before. For one of my colleagues it was singing, for others it was playing the guitar, trying to apply these lessons but let me tell you it is not fun. And secondly, it's hugely discouraging to be so bad at something when you look like you should be good at it. That's the idea that we want to deliberately practice. The question is what could we do as a profession to deliberately practice. And so, let me tell you about something in our field that I think is very important to study that came out in 2009. Uhm, by a number of colleagues of mine, Tim Anderson and Ben Ogles, ah, ah, at, ah, Ohio of state. Mike Lambert at BYU, David Ramirez, too, I believe right now is at Loma Linda, ah, out here in California. Very interesting study, they had 25 therapists who were, ah, who worked with a total of 1100 clients. For all of these clients they measured the outcome. So they knew exactly how effective the therapist were with these 1100 clients split between them. They also measured a variety of demographic variables of the therapists, their age, their gender, their experience, their approach, the hours they spent for a week providing services, etcetera and they also, given what some of us believe and our team believed it as well, they had a control for social skills. They measured how socially apt, adept the people were. How much emotional intelligence they had and ability to connect with folks because they wanted to make sure that that wasn't the variable that accounted for what they did find. They then, ah, rank the therapists in order from least effective to most effective, oh, I know that grades. I know but let me say it again once they measured they then rank order the therapist from least effective to most. Now, for those of you who are worried, remember, most of us are average. We are, most of us are average. Just so you know I'm average therapist. Yeah. I'm an average therapist. I wish I were a supershrink but I'm not. I'm an average therapist that's why I'm here teaching. You know, if I could do this shit I'd stay home. Yeah, I can talk about it. That's what I'm good at. There's a reason why I'm not better than average and now will come back to that, ah, in a minute. In any event they, they rank order the therapist from least effective the most say just to be reassure you. Even the least effective therapist in the sample were effective, it's just they weren't as effective as the, the best. Now, we can all say, "Yeah, you don't have to be good enough." I agree with that in large measure but if it's your child who do you want them seen by? Then you wanna know this person really can do what they say and they do it better than the person next door. You wanna weigh to make a decision about this stuff. It's fair to our clients, why isn't it for us? So in any event, they then put them, after they measure all these things, they then put them in a bit of a test. Now, here's the test. Uhm, they put them in front of, ah, a, ah, computer and they had a 4x4 matrix of films they shown. Now, hang with me here, I don't have anything to write on so I'm just gonna try to draw it within the air. Four different therapeutic issues or concerns that most people considered challenging, four different. For example, a client says, "I'm gonna kill myself." Now, if you've been there before, you know, this is not easy necessarily to deal with. A client who says I'm not coming back the next session because I don't like you personally, that's another one. So, two to be-- they had four of those along the top and they had four emotional valences with which these different problems were presented. So for example they had a client who was angry and suicidal, allright. "I'm gonna kill myself, ah," they had a dependent suicidal client. "I'm gonna kill myself, please stop me." They had, ah, confuse to suicidal client. "You know, I think I'm gonna kill myself or maybe not. You know, either-- I, I think I will-- no I-- maybe I'm already dead. Ah, I, I don't know." And they had a blaming suicidal client, "I'm gonna kill myself," and you've been here before. So, they had four emotional valences and four different clinical scenarios, are you with me? So for the client who's gonna dropout, he doesn't like you, they'd also be angry, hostile, dependent, etcetera. One at the time, they had a 4x4 grid. So, they measure the therapist's outcomes, what do they do next? They sat them in front of the computer screen and they had made snippets, short snippets of interactions between that client and a real therapist. They would show the short, short-- well, that's hard to say, they would show the short snippet. You try it. They would show the short the snippet and then midstream the film went to a stop and you had to type in what you would say next and you couldn't go, "Go on." Neither could you say, "Uh-uh." Well, you could but everyone in the study knew that their responses were being rated on a measure called the facilitative skills inventory, the FIS. This is a very complicated measurement tool that measures responses to-- let me just start over. FIS uses two independent raters who will look at your response and rate it on three qualities. Here they are, empathy, empathy, collaboration and distance. Empathy, collaboration and distance. How much distance does you-- your response put between you and your client? let me give you an example, client says, "I'm suicidal," and you say, "We all have to make choices." This would be distancing response, right? And that was a little more complicated. So I remember a student. this a true story. I remember a student, ah, I remember student that I'm behind the mirror at brief and I'm, I'm supervising and this student is really what would you call it earnest, very earnest. And so this guy, she's talking with this guy, not Al but, you know, be-- Al, you'll be my proxy here there's-- she's talking back and forth. And a guy is anxious, that's his presenting complaint. And, ah, the student's listening, she has this look of empathy, uhm, on her face and she's really trying very hard and the client is talking more and more about being anxious and then finally he discloses. He says, "You know, he says, ah, when I'm anxious I masturbate." And my student says, "So do I." And I couldn't pick up the phone fast enough, you know, that's, ah. This would be actually low on the empathy scale. It's something else, I don't know what you call it, ah, but it's not-- it's not that. So, you get my point here the FIS, the FIS, ah, two independent raters and here's the kid cool part the raters have to agree. If they don't agree then there's a third rater brought in for the-- to break the tie about the, the score. In this particular study the inter-rater agreement was something like 95 or 96%, don't hold me to that, it was way high. So, they really did judge how effective therapist responded to these statements in the 16 different domains on the FIS. 

01:23:10
Considerable differences in outcome between clinicians (~9%): •Age, gender, percentage of work and time spent conducting therapy, theoretical orientation not correlated with outcome; •General interpersonal skills not correlated with outcome; •Only domain-specific interpersonal knowledge predicted outcome 

01:23:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Are you ready to fear-- hear what they found? Here's what they found. They found that there were in fact considerable differences in outcome between clinicians, about 9% of the variants. The figure you hear is between five and 9% then you may be thinking five and 9% that's not very much in our work five and 9% is so big you could drive a truck through it. If you were getting five to 9% and you're retiring investments, most of us would be happy with that in this down economy. Five to 9% improvement in the-- in the sell of your house that's a-- that's a big amount. So, it's big. And here's what they also found, age, gender, percentage of work time spent conducting therapy, theoretical orientation not correlated with differences and outcome. In other words, you cannot predict the best from the rest simply by hearing those variables. Are you with me here? They didn't reliably differentiate what did predict? What predicted, oh, one more thing it didn't predict, general interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence it did not predict. Whether or not certain therapist were better than others, right? It's too general. It's too decontextualized. This is about a very specific skill knowing what to say to whom at this moment presenting this way at this time. Are you with me? And you may think, oh, my God how do you get that? Deliberate practice. You have to force that craft into your head because we rely on system one generalizations all too much. And why do we rely on them, because a lot of the time it works. It's when it doesn't work that's the problem when we still see things as system one. So, general interpersonal skills did not correlate with outcome. What correlated only domain-specific interpersonal knowledge what this mean? The better-- hang with me here-- visual, the better the clinician was, the more empathic collaborative and less distance and they were in a broader range of those interpersonal challenges. Let me say it again, the more effective the therapist was the more empathic collaborative and less distancing they were in a-- in a more broad and diverse, ah, a emotional environment with their clients. In other words, they knew exactly what to say to whom at the right time with this person with that problem. Are you with me? The question is, how the hell do you get it? Because our training by nature has to stay at the general level. You can get the basics you know that, at school you can get it here at this conference including this particular workshop to get it at a different level you have to go home and try the stuff out and spend time afterwards thinking about it. Am I making sense?

01:25:45
SCOTT D. MILLER So, how do we do that? How can we, ah, deliberately practice and move this, ah, move our knowledge to a new level. We like to describe a process we called TAR getting knowledge's to stick in your head and it's specific to you. What you need to know to help your clients is going to be different from the person next to you not because everybody is so different it's not about that, it's because what you know is different in the person next to you. And you have to play to your errors to the things that you don't do well. It's the only way to get better. Think, act and reflect is the acronym we use, ah, to talk about this process of deliberate practice in our particular field. I'd like to go into detail teach you how to do that but I'm mindful you've now been sitting for 90 minutes. And so, if, if it's acceptable to you I think if-- it will be okay, could we take five minutes stand up, if you need a drink move around and then I promise I'll promptly start in five to seven minutes, all right? I hope you'll stick with me. Alright, welcome back. After this short break I appreciate your willingness to take just a brief break, give me a chance to rest my voice you could grab a drink and some questions and after we're finished at one o'clock if you don't have an urgent engagement to get to I'm more than willing to hang out and try a bit, ah, an answer your questions I know that this format makes a more me talking act you rather than engaging your, ah, ah, in a conversation about it which is my preference. So, where have we gone? Outcomes have stayed the same that's where we're at. And we have tried desperately as a field to improve our outcomes, it's not for lack of trying, it's not for lack of motivation, we've studied models, we've written books, we've gone to workshops, we practice long and hard at the work we do but our outcomes haven't seem to improve. In addition for most of us we achieve a certain level of a proficiency outcome and we don't get much better and the research if you wanna know the truth actually indicates-- well let me-- let me just show you this isn't part of the presentation but I think it will be fun to look at, ah, if in a sort of Gallo's humor kind of way. Uhm, ah, let see here, uhm, if I can find it quickly. There some work that was done early on, ah, by a researcher, ah, by the name of, uhm, Paul Clement. Uhm, and Paul Clement a very interesting guy in the 19-- what year would it have been in the 19, ah, hang with me here where is it, oh, geez, I'm not gonna able to get this, one more time. Sorry about this hang with me. Here we go. In the, uhm, in 1994 I think it was I've been in the field for about five years. And I came across this study by this guy Paul Clement. And it was very disturbing to me and I-- I've, I've have do most of my career kept up a folder in my office about studies that I find disturbing and I don't want anybody else to find. 

01:29:10
Achieving Clinical Excellence: Sources of Inferior Performance •Psychologist Paul Clement publishes a quantitative study of 26 years as a psychologist •683 cases falling into 84 different DSM categories. 

01:29:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Uhm, ah, and Paul he does this study where he looks back and Paul's right here from California lives over in Pasadena's practice there for a very long time. And when I read this article what I thought was is that, ah, he is certainly been an org-- at a conference like this. If only because he was one brave dude, uhm, he published 26 years quantitative study of 26 years of his work, this is a guy starts in 1968, and he's monitoring carefully the outcome of his work something most of us don't even do in 2013 carefully measuring, carefully following up with clients nobody paid him for this by the way, he just felt driven to find out how effective am I. And so Paul does this study here, 26 years, 683 cases falling in the 84 different DSM categories and he publishes it in one of APAs most prominent professional journals, professional psychology I thought-- and here's what he says, she says, "Uhm, I had expected to find that I had gotten better and better over the years. Uhm, but then he said... 

01:30:10
UNKNOWN "Holy nightmare." 

01:30:10
SCOTT D. MILLER That my data failed to suggest any changes in my therapeutic effectiveness across the 26 years in question. Ah, you know, I know what yet is easy to think and I thought the same thing I thought you know poor Paul. Uhm, ah, you know, it an outlier to the rest of us, ah, who are obviously getting better there has to be in a sort of the low score, ah, at somewhere and it must be him. Ah, and I means-- I mean actually in San Diego doing a conference and somebody comes up to me this person maybe here in the audience today I don't know. And, and he says, he says, ah, do you know Paul that's right, ah, he says do you know Paul Clement and you can tell if I'm telling the story and I agree and I said no, I don't he says well, I know Paul Clement quite well was my supervisor we've been interacted for a long period of time. He says would you like to meet Paul Clement and I said, "Oh, shit." You know, cuz I, I know maybe Paul was embarrassed by this study you know. Something he published in his youth and maybe he was intoxicated at that the time. Ah, he didn't think it was good to published this, no, he says, I, you know, I give him my card and, ah, and , ah, about three weeks later I get a-- I get an in my office I get a manila envelop and in that manila envelope is a study, uhm, and that study is outcomes from 40 years of psychotherapy practice. Now, this is one anal dude. This is a guy whose going above and beyond the call of duty, he deserves the gold star in our field he really does. For publishing this 40 years of outcome research nobody pays for that kind of stuff. He did it on his own, uhm, interesting. By the way here's another little interesting finding, uhm, if you're-- if you are having your x-ray's read in particular chest x-rays, it may happened that they are not read by a physician in the country in which you live. They maybe outsourced to other countries where the labor is cheaper globalization is here, ah, to stay. Now, Ericsson see this is a research opportunity, what does Ericsson find? He finds that certain of these external readers actually have a much higher hit rate than others. When he follows up to find out why is this particular physician or reads his x -rays on a screen separated from the pages better here's what he finds. After they read the film which is what they got paid for by the way. The payments stopped after they look to the film type their note no more payment. These physicians were much more likely to pick up the phone called the physician overseas and say, "Was I right." Do you get it ? There was follow up, there was feedback the rest of us we do our job. What Paul Clement did was he said, "Was I right? Did it help, did it work for you." 

01:33:00
Achieving Clinical Excellence: Sources of Inferior Performance •Reported results from a 40 year period, nearly 2000 different clients: •Outcomes not only to improve but actually began to decrease! 

01:33:00
SCOTT D. MILLER And so he does this study, ah, 40 years nearly 2000 different clients he's been able to follow up overtime and here's what he writes in his article, he finds that actually his outcomes not only failed to improve but it actually got worse. Something for all of us to look forward to. And yet you know this is true, if you've done even the slightest bit of reading about skill maintenance. You know, that if you don't work like the devil you begin in an inexorable decline in your performance it's not something we want to pay attention to and thank goodness system once says, "don't look." Don't pay attention of that pesky little man behind the curtain that's telling you're actually getting worse, don't do it in any event Paul Clement he was the person who pointed this out first and I think we've understood a little better now why it might be that we haven't gotten better and what we need to do in order to make this happen.

SCOTT D. MILLER So think, act and reflect. Now, I will say I did have several people approach me on the break and say, "Did you know there's a typo?" Now if you didn't notice the typo welcome to the need for deliberate practice. Several people came up and said, "You know, you're missing an L in the word, some of you are still looking on what typo as-- it must be those little pesky letters down here. You know, what did they say, "No, its the big one." It's the big one, the biggest giant word reflect says refect actually. Uhm, and most people go it it now. Ah, think, act and reflect. Let's talk about each one of these and illustrate them a bit. Think, when you think if your deliberate practice is going to be effective you ask the first identify the limits of your realm of reliable performance. You can't just think about your cases, you have to think about your cases in a particular way where your abilities have broken down that edge. If you don't practice at the edge of your performance abilities you won't get any better. Let me give you an example from an alternate field to help-- I hope clear-- clarify. Uhm, Ericsson also studied, ah, figure skaters and in the last, ah, ah, 2006 rather Olympics in Turin, ah, he was have-- having the figure skaters keep lugs of how they spent their time their practice time on ice. Here's what he found that I think is quite telling. He found that the better the figure skater did at the Olympics the more time they spent practicing their part of their routine that they didn't have mastered. Are you with me? They were practicing at their age-- now wait the minute-- wait the minute not too far over the edge because then you are prone to injury. And not before the edge because that just merely feels good, if your work is feeling good you're not deliberately practicing. You've got to push yourself beyond what you know and know how to do come to-- I'm not talking about I'm gonna learn how to treat trauma, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about whatever the cases in your door are you able to engage that particular person and when you're not that is your edge. Think, identify the limits of your realm of reliable performance and then number two develop a specific plan of action with the description of two things, your process objectives what will I be doing when I do this plan of action and number two the outcome objective. How will I know I did it? How will I know? Very specific, now, if you already thinking, ah, gee, this sounds like a lot of work. It's, okay, to be average it's really is. You don't have to push beyond, I'm telling you, your average results are really pretty good, ah, they really are. I'm talking about actually writing this stuff out by hand making an specific plan once you identify, oh, by the way here's one hint about how to identify the realm of reliable performance, you will need to measure your performance in some way. And what I mean by measurement is you're gonna have to probably use a standardized scale. That's why they teach scales in music so that we know if you're varying from the scale and which scale are you on? Are you with me here? It give us something common to hang on to in judge our variations from it. So, also you may have to measure-- I'm gonna talk about that on Friday at our workshop called feedback-informed treatment. Develop that specific plan of action, ah, and description of the intended outcome. I thought it-- like to show you just a small brief film, ah, of a somebody who engages in a great deal of a-- of, of deliberate practice and this is from a conference we did this last year. Uhm, achieving clinical excellence, ah, conference and this particular we, we invited K. Anders Ericsson was there for example, he did one of the keynote addresses if you ever have a chance to see him absolutely phenomenal researcher, ah, and speaker. He, ah, he was there and before each speaking event we invited performance for a variety of domains, sports, music, dance, ah, magic, comedy to entertain before the speaker went on. The idea was to both inspire and educate or it defy. Uhm, so we wanted a, a moving performance before then the boring science speakers would come on. Ah, and, ah, and, ah, it help us figure out how to-- acha-- achieve that. So, we had a great luck, we manage to get, ah, Rachel Hsu who is, ah, a concert pianist to come in play prelude opening music at this event. And she chose for her piece before Ericsson went on to play, ah, Un Suspiro, Un Suspiro I know nothing about music I already admitted that so what I'm telling you-- they told me if it's a lie, ah, I can't be responsible. Ah, here's what-- here's what she said, ah, they she said that, uhm, most people consider least quite difficult anyway. In fact, during the time, during his contemporaries couldn't play his music it was so difficult which is a great way to do at the competition. All right, you just-- you just do shit, it so hard nobody else can even do it. Ah, and so they-- she plays Un Suspiro, ah, sigh and this piece they say is about a 12 on a scale of one to 10. It has three steps which I guess is hard. And you have to-- in order to play it correctly you have to constantly crash your hands back and forth. If you play it right then it suppose to sound like a bubbling brook water in a brook. If you play it wrong it sounds like disorganized chaos, ah, perhaps more like a waterfall, ah, instead. Rachel Hsu gets up there and she plays this piece and it is so its, it so moving people in the audience could hardly speak, ah, and at-- so when I went to introduce Anders after this I say and Anders Ericsson people like, ohhhhhh, oh, I forgot to tell you Rachel Hsu is 8 years old. Yeah. Oh , by the way would you like to see her. Don't go-- okay, wait a second, hang on. Wait s second, here we go, hang on. Hang with me here, here's Rachel Hsu. 

01:39:55
Top Performers: Rachel Hsu & Roger Shen 

01:40:00
[music] 

01:40:05
SCOTT D. MILLER By the way she also plays the violin. Yeah, it just makes you wanna joker. Ah, ah, really. Uhm, Rachel is, ah, and we didn't ask her to do this by the way can we have the video back. We didn't-- we didn't actually ask her to do this you're gonna see that is the camera panned, you're gonna see people who are actually at breakfast much like they were here at the pre-conference they're eating breakfast and this little thing shows up and starts playing the violin and people aren't exactly sure like what-- how to take this. Like is this like a street urchin we should put money, ah, in, into our hand who is this little thing? Ah, ah, later I said, I said Rachel why-- we didn't ask you to do that, why did you do that? Rachel says no kidding she says, "I was trying to get a feel for the audience." I'm thinking, uh, you know, okay, all right. Here we go. Can you see here, people-- look people don't know what to do about this they can't figure it out. Now, this is Roger Shen he played at the second-- his, his 9 years old. 

01:41:10
[music] 

01:41:20
SCOTT D. MILLER By the way you think a New York kid right now? You're going to screw that man. I think you ought to take something easier like crayon coloring. All right. Here's the way, okay, okay, here we go back to back to back to our-- and then comes Rachel. 

01:41:40
[music] 

01:42:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Are you moved? It was really remarkable being in the room with her and then-- and the expectation of people, ah, at the conference and then they see this little thing playing this piece. Uhm, and like I said afterwards she was done and people were sort of they didn't know like to they were and so they were sitting and I said, "And now, Anders Ericsson, people went, ohhh, bring on the kid." And I was like what it's Anders Ericsson Mr. expertise, boo, shut up, you know, it's a more than guy here, ah, ah, so I, I said, okay, wait sorry Anders to bring Rachel up and so we brought Rachel up and sat with her and I said to the audience I said, "What do you wanna talk about with Rachel?" Ah, and somebody raise her hand in the audience and said, ah, she, she was so bold over, ah, quite emotion she said, "Where did that come from? Where did that come from?" and Rachel Hsu at this particular point she's transformed into an 8-year-old kid. She kind a go and she just say, she says, "I don't know what you're asking." Right. And then of course the adult did what adults do when kids don't understand and they talk more slowly, you know, is where did that come-- Rachel just says I don't under-- these seems go back and forth very useful dialogue. And finally, I think it done on Rachel, uhm, that what's being ask and she says, "Oh, do you mean like does somebody in my pi-- in my family play the play?" Yes. Nobody plays, wait the minute not your mother? No. Father? No. Brother? No. Nobody plays a violin, grandparents nothing no. I'm the only one who plays a piano. Ha, so she ask again, "Then where like where you just born this way?" Rachel Hsu says, "No." She says, four hours a day everyday of the week Saturdays and Sundays my birthday and Christmas that's what she says. She says last year, last year my family went on a vacation to Italy. My mother called ahead everytime to make sure there was a piano there so I could get in my practice hours. Now, this is one I'm listening to Rachel when I'm leaning back to my chair thinking and you know what, average is looking better and better. Give me the remote and pass me a beer. All right. Now, we as a group we don't have to put in four hours a day and some part of me also thinks you know, part of the reason Rachel can do this is because she's a kid. She doesn't have any other shit to do like me. All right. Work I have to do to play for the damn piano lessons. And she hasn't have enough to do any of that stuff, she gets to practice and that is a priority for everybody around her. And as a result she gets accessed to better and better teachers overtime-- you following me and it creates a virtual cycle of increasing expertise which opens more doors to better teachers which lead to a better performance etcetera and etcetera. And at some point, at some point although deliberate practice isn't inherently rewarding from the outset it becomes rewarding. The challenge of moving your skill just one sliver that's one piece. The second piece is this, I got to ask question of Rachel which is stock the answer-- her answer stock with me for a long time. Largely because I think it came out of the mouth of an 8-year-old kid. I said and I don't know maybe there were some ulterior for me asking, but I said to Rachel, I said, "Rachel, did you make any mistakes?" I ask her in front of the whole group I said, "Did you make any mistakes?" And Rachel again she have that-- she was 8-- she's 8 years old. She has this lovely giggle, she goes, and she says, "I made a lot of mistakes. I made a lot." And I said, "I didn't hear one." And Rachel said, "That's because you're no good." 

01:45:45
[sil.] 

01:45:50
SCOTT D. MILLER I said, "Get off the stage you little brat." You know, no, ah, ah, and then she said the most profoundly, she said, "You cannot get better at playing the piano while you're playing the piano." And I was thinking this would sound good in your voice, all right. "Uhm, I cannot be better playing the piano or not." Right. I'm thinking what, what, what this is I mean, yes, and what do you mean by that she says, "I can't correct what I've done wrong while I'm playing. I have to play through." She says but afterwards and my teacher whose sitting now in the audience she's listening I'm listening I can hear it. I say, "Well, what you do?" She says, "I isolate those small ears they're not growth, they're not big ears and untrained ear can't hear him, I can." She says I need that audience remember to say this piece and then she says I pull those out and I practice those over and over and over again. Does it make sense to you? So, deliberate practice will also probably be a bit boring. Because you have to do-- it's very tempting cuz you wanna start all the way at the beginning of the performance when she make a mistake. So, here's a little clue, pick a small thing very, very small thing right at the edge of your performance and practice that, that practice that piece. It maybe it's how you invite clients into your office? Maybe it's a small piece of which chair you ask them to sit in etcetera, whatever it might be right at the edge of your performance. Am I making sense? Alright. This is also why, it make no sense at the general level to teach this skill simply because what will-- what will be your edge will be different for the next person.

DELIBERATE PRACTICE T.A.R. ACT: • Execute the plan of action •Note the steps of the plan that were missed • Identify any actions taken not part of the original plan Miller, S.D. , Hubble, M.A., & Duncan, B.L. (2007).

01:47:25
SCOTT D. MILLER The second piece is to act. You've got act. So you've thought this through, you've developed your plan with process and outcome goals. This is key, not just outcomes goals but also process goals what will tell me I am on the way. Of course Rachel Hsu's outcome goal is to play Un Suspiro flawlessly but her process goal is to play this one stanza these three notes perfectly in terms of timing etcetera. And she says, infuriatingly you practice this part and it's like a cartoon character this part pops up. Ah, it somehow that's not any good you have to practice that piece, ah, again. So, uhm, act execute your plan of action. So you're in your session you're executing your plan of action. Now, if you're thinking about doing deliberate practice I'm telling you the chances of you being able to do this with all your clients is zero. You're gonna have to pick one client or you practice this new skill. Maybe it's-- depending on what your edge is, a new start client how you introduced them, ah, to your office in your room. The, the so you're gonna execute the plan of action. Immediately afterwards, immediately afterwards you need to go through your deliberate plan and note this steps of the plan that were missed. You might have hopped over that particular step or just forgotten about it. Don't judge this negatively. Ask yourself why did I hop over that step? If I forgot it and you think it might have been useful you're gonna have to remind yourself how to be, ah, conscious of that next time. But many times in the moment you'll be sensitive to contextual clues and will say this isn't right. You wanna pay attention to that so you can modify your plan. Am I making sense to you? Number three, identify any actions taken that were not part of your original plan. Sometimes you're good for no damn good reason. You wanna notice the step that you missed. Ah, ah, that, that you didn't take and ask yourself why. Can we put, ah, slide and thank you. Identify any actions rather taken that were not part of your original plan, this is all immediately afterwards. Now, let me tell you, if you've been consciously practicing during that session the last thing you want to do it at the end of the session is think about it because you'll be tired. Deliberate practice sessions are at the, ah, at their longest when they are 45 minutes. And here's why. You cannot sustain conscious attention that long. So, if you're not tired by the way if ee-- people will say why deliberately practice I feel energized by it. I'm telling you you're not deliberately practicing. Deliberate practice is cognitively depleting, you have to attend to every moment so work to be depleted, work hard to be conscious of all of those steps the ones you took, the ones you hopped over, ah, that weren't part of that original plan perfect you're going to act. 

01:50:20
DELIBERATE PRACTICE T.A.R. REFLECT: •Review the plan and execution •Identify errors •Outline alternative actions Miller, S.D. , Hubble, M.A., & Duncan, B.L. (2007).

01:50:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Uhm, the, ah, third step is reflect, you're going to reflect. And this is done later, maybe later in the day or overtime. Ah, you're gonna reflect while you review your plan and the execution and you identify errors, small processed errors, ah, that you-- that you may have made, ah, in, in that particular, ah, execution of your plan. And you're going to outline alt-- excuse me, alternative actions. So, I'm gonna give an example of this in moment but right now let's just say the more alternative actions you think about the more possibilities there will be once you go in the room. I think of people who were known as deliberate practice or there's lots of famous stories for example about Ericsson, Milton Ericsson who would sit down and write out a induction long hand. Then he would go back later and, and eliminate certain parts. Come back later again, another person who deliberately practice was Benjamin Franklin. If you read about how Benjamin Franklin learn to write what he did was he copied verbatim transcripts out of books and writings he admired. Then here's what he did, he once copied he would put the book away think about-- think about this, he would put book the away and days later he would try to rewrite it from memory. Rewriting and constructing those senses then he would go back and he would compare the two. Are you getting drift here? If you're a psychologist or psychiatrist and you're doing mental status exams let me give you a challenge, don't go in there and ask people to do serial sevens and who the president it is, go in there and see if you can get a sense of people's mental status. Leave the room guess about how they'll answer then go back in later and do the metal status exam. Are you following me? Now, you're putting other skills and observations to work rather than relying on the tool you will stretch your performance. You can do the same thing with your clients. Think about the last session you have. Let me-- let's just do these right now, think about the last session you had and the last two weeks or month when you think you were doing some of your best work think about it, just think about that session. Not a full treatment but a session where you felt like this was me at my best clinically. Now, ask yourself don't say out loud, ask yourself the name of the person you were treating at the time. What was that person's name? When you go home tonight here's what I'd like you to do, I'd like you to write out and you won't do it most of us won't do it. I'd like you to write out long hand a description of what you did in the room that makes that a good example of you, what your best. Write it that long hand what you said, what you did who you are, what was going on around you. Then for the following week, hang with me after each session you have or a group of sessions on a particular day meet with your client and afterwards look at your description and ask what was I missing? So that this wasn't like this, are you following me? this is what top performers do, they're constantly making this comparison reflecting on their work asking how come this varied from my usual high quality work. Have I made sense to you? These are just some minor suggestions here that you can do, review the plan, identify errors outline, ah, alternative actions. 

01:53:45
DELIBERATE PRACTICE THINK •Identify the limits of one's "realm of reliable performance" •Develop a specific plan of action and description of the intended outcome DELIBERATE PRACTICE THINK •Research on the power of the relationship reflected in over 1100 research findings. •Independent of the approach, diagnosis, researcher allegiance, or time assessment.

01:53:45
SCOTT D. MILLER So, deliberate practice, let's go into a little bit more detail-- about something we could work with each of us. And this is merely a suggestion, ah, based on my observations as I travel around and teach its process about what would probably benefit most of us to focus more attention on. Thinking means identifying the limits of one's realm of reliable performance. So, what could you do some thinking about. And I'm going to suggest that one area all of us could improve on is our ability to align and engage with the people we work with. Alliance why talk about alliance because it is the most evidence-based concept in the treatment literature. Eleven hundred separate research findings suggesting the alliance is a robust predictor of outcome and yet-- unless you're from very approaches, chances of you having spent lot of time studying, practicing the alliance or that it's very small number. In addition, we just finished the study here's the cool study this is done with their old child as well. We gave therapist, hold on to your seats here, we, we ask therapist to participate in an online survey. Now, because we are psychologist part of the research we did involved deception of the subjects. All right, that's the fun part about being a psychologist. You get to lie for scientific reasons, all right. And so, what we did is we made up the survey really the survey had nothing to do with anything we didn't even care what the responses were because what we wanted people to do was choose a price that they would get. If they won the raffle for having participated in doing the study. Are you with me here? And we had six different choices, looks like a lot of choices but really the two-- there were only two choices they varied in only one of two ways. Are you with me so far? Three of the choices were about some new model of treatment and we made up model names, the neuropsychological brain-based amygdala oriented treatment. We made up these ideas and then we had three that were based on alliance. Relationship abilities connecting with clients engaging the difficult person. All we were looking at was, what did therapist likely choose? Let me ask you, can you guess? Why, why do we do these? I, I honestly I don't get it we are fascinated with what is fascinating, ah, to, to the field. In any event, uhm, the alliance is one thing I think we could focus on because it's also independent of the approach diagnosis, researcher, allegiance and time of assessment in the research. What about the alliance would you focus on? Well, ah, let me tell you a study, ah, and I'm wha-- I'll promise will get there, Baldwin 2007. Scott Baldwin is one of my heroes, ah, right up there with Paul Clement. Baldwin does a study 331 clients, 81 clinicians. Now, let me measure and say it again, 331 clients treated by 81 clinicians they measure the outcomes and they rank order the therapist again. From least effective to most. Even the least effective were effective just for anyone worried in the audience. But some or more effective than others once again who do you want treating your child. So, what they were trying to look at was what accounted for the difference. Why were some therapist more effective than others? Are you with me? And here's what they found, I sight this study because you never see this kind of research in our field. The, the gist of the evidence. Here's what they found, they found that therapist variability in the alliance that is our ability to connect with that person or that one, or that one, or that one. Therapist difference in ability to connect with a client in terms of the alliance accounted for 97% of the difference in outcome. Think about that, 97% of the difference in outcome accounted for by therapist variability in the alliance. Now, let me just contrast that and then you think of the implications. The contrast is by contrast, can we have the slide please. Zero percent of the-- of the difference in outcome was accounted for by client variability in the alliance, zero. In other words, it is not the clients job to connect with us, it's our job to connect with the client. And the question is, does the language you use shift that burden to you or to the client? Are you following me? If you hear yourself saying my client is resisting, you have shift to the burden to the client. It's not their job to be cooperative, it's your job to foster cooperation. Now, you may think Scott, you can't have an alliance with every client. And I say, "That's right, you can't marry everyone you date." All right, you can't. Lord know some of us have tried. But where that ends is your edge of professional development. That's why I think honestly most of us go to workshops about models and methods, we hope we'll be able to extend the last saw of change around one additional client. How bet you've come to this conference with the client or two in your head. They are hoping I'll get some idea about them. Uhm, interesting process, so the alliance, what does it that mean, 97% of the difference in outcome accounted for by therapist variability in the alliance, what do I need to do? Extend my ability to connect with a broader, more clinically complex, and emotionally different client than I'm used too. Does it make sense? 

01:59:45
DELIBERATE PRACTICE An Experiment INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR CLINICAL EXCELLENCE 

01:59:50
SCOTT D. MILLER The only way to do that is to somehow measure in the process. So, let me do a little experiment with you. Let me do one more little experiment. How can you pay attention to this? So, in a minute I'm going to show you a video and in this video you've all been prime now, pay attention. In this video, ah, you are going to watch a, uhm, a magic trick. Now, you may-- you may not be a magician I'm guessing you're not. But here's your task, your task is to figure out how the trick is done. That's it. Figure out how the trick is done. Now, let me give one other piece of advice, it's very simple and stupid. In fact, most magic tricks are simple and stupid, we make them complex because the way they're presented seem so impossible, so I want you to think simple. Now, here's the other piece, I do not want to talk with each other and some of you will be attempted to share your insights with the person next to you. I ask you take a look be quite don't share. Just try to figure out how this trick is done and say nothing else to each other while you watch. Let me think if there's anything else. When I end then I'm going to ask you to talk to your neighbor and I'm gonna give you 15 seconds to describe how it was done. Now, if at the end this you have no idea you were just mystified and entertained that's perfectly fine turn to your neighbor and say I have no idea how this was done. I was mystified and entertain. But if you have an idea I'd like you to keep that idea limited to simply telling people about the method, how was the trick accomplished, nothing else. Are you with me here? Here we go. Let me come back here and put the video on.

The Amazing Color Changing Card Trick 

02:01:35
[sil.] 

02:01:45
RICHARD Hi, I'm Richard(ph) this is Sara(ph) and we're going to perform the amazing color changing card trick with this blue back deck of cards. Now, the idea is very simple I'm just gonna spread the cards in front of Sara and ask her to push any card towards the camera. 

02:02:00
SARA Okay. I wanna key that finger. I wanna go for this card here. 

02:02:05
RICHARD Okay, now, Sara(ph) could have selected any card at all from the deck but she has selected the card which is now face down on the table, all I'm going to ask is to do is show us which card she selected. 

02:02:20
SARA I might the card I had chose was in fact is three of diamonds. 

02:02:25
RICHARD The three of diamonds, okay, excellent choice that card goes back into the deck. Now, I'm just going to spread the cards face off on the table. Okay, this is a quick looking this and you will see the Sara's(ph) card here has now got a blue back noticeably surprising, what slightly more surprising is all of the other cards have got red backs and that is the amazing color changing card trick. 

02:02:50
The End 

02:02:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Now, now hang with me here. Uhm, what I'd like you to do at this point is simply turn to your neighbor and describe how the trick was done. And I'd like to keep your conversation to that for the moment. How was this trick done 15 seconds have fun. 

02:03:15
[sil.] 

02:03:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Five seconds. All right, stop. And let me ask, who has an idea about how this trick was done? And is fairly confident about it? Yes, sir, how was the trick done? He switched decks. Now, let me ask you in the audience, how many of you have somewhat the same idea, a deck switch? All right, we-- okay, that's interesting a lot of people are don't have another idea or don't know but a lot of people said a deck switch and so now I'm gonna tell you something that we'll probably get-- me kicked out of the fraternity of magicians. This is what happened. In, in actually magicians have a name for it, it's called a deck switch. I kid you not. And a good magician doesn't use camera work like here. They can actually do a deck switch as you're looking or as they would say burning their hands, you burn their hands and you don't see it. So, if you want away cool experience tonight you go back to your hotel room and you're done looking at porn go on to what? You go on to YouTube and type in Dean Dil, the name Dean and then Dil like a pickle, Dean Dil Blizzard. And you're gonna get about four or five demonstrations of an effect created by a magician named Dean Dil, ah, it was one of the fields most, ah, prolific contributors and Dean Dill has this effect blizzard and in blizzard it invo-- I'm not supposed to tell you this but it involves a deck switch. And the deck switch occurs right when you're look at it. And my guesses you have to watch the video about five or six times before you see it. If you ever see it all it is so smooth. Which is in interesting idea if that's what this were about. But this video is not about that it was about something else entirely, hang with me here. 

02:05:20
Did you notice? This video is not about the color changing cards There were four other color changes 1 2 3 4 Start of video 

02:05:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Let me go back to the film. Here we go. 

02:05:35

02:05:35
Start of video Here's the "bigger" picture 

02:05:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Now let me ask I love this, I love of it in a big cross, like, ohhh, ahhh, I love it, it feels so, so let me ask you how many be honest now, how many of you who would never seen this video before, saw all four color changes. one, two, three, four, five in a room of maybe 905 people saw all four colored changes and I've never seen before that's pretty amazing. Here's my question what the hell were the rest of you looking at? Because, yeah, ah, we are looking at the cards we have an excuse. We did our paper work, right. Think about this and the color changes weren't exactly minor. It didn't go from purple to mob, it went from a black table cloth to beige, a black background to red and the two presenters change shirts. And what did all of you doing? You're going that's an interesting card trick there. All sort of shits going on and you're thinking, "I know how this trick's done. That's not gonna fool me, uh-uh, I got my act together I'm a licensed." Think about that. Now, if I go back and show you the video again you go, "Oh, yeah, there's a color there I see it, yeah, there's color," but that doesn't count except for some people who are able to see it. What do we need to keep our eye on when our alliance isn't engaging to the client. We say a lot of stuff that doesn't engage people its-- hard to spent an hour a day with that or an hour with that particular person. So, let me just-- we need something to help us broaden the frame to see where our errors are. So let me broaden the frame honest video one more time, here's what I'd like you to do, just watch don't talk to your neighbor, here we go. Let me just broaden the frame of it. Broaden the frame what can we do to broaden the frame, switch from system one to system two. 

02:07:50
Start of video Here's the "bigger" picture 

02:07:55
RICHARD Hi, I'm Richard(ph) this is Sara(ph), ah, we got to form the amazing color changing card trick with this blue back deck of cards. Now idea is very simple, I'm just gonna spread the cards in front of Sara(ph) and ask her to push any card towards the camera. 

02:08:10
SARA Okay, let's see on it, I'm gonna get for this card here. 

02:08:15
RICHARD Okay, now Sara(ph) who's selecting any card at all from the deck which she selected the card which is now face down on the table. What I'm going to ask as you to do is show us which card she selected. 

02:08:30
SARA Right, so the card I chose was in fact is three of diamonds. 

02:08:35
RICHARD The three of diamonds, okay, excellent choice. That card goes back into the deck. Now, I'm just going to spread the cards face off on the table. You know, just a chick of the fingers and you'll see that Sara's(ph) card here has now got a blue back not surprising, what's likely more surprising is all of the other cards have got red backs and that is the amazing color changing card trick. 

02:09:05
SCOTT D. MILLER So we need something to help us broaden out-- and let me tell you some interesting research that's been done by, this by the way is a psychologist from Scotland his name is Richard Wiseman, it's a fantastic YouTube channel if you've never seen it before, most of his videos can be found there. Uhm, but, ah, researchers actually fit people with the helmet that bounces as a laser off their eye while they're watching films like this. To see where your looking and the truth is most of us is look right at the color changes but we do not see them, we system one, tells us not important. And then in one way it wasn't important unless it was. And then you have-- because the truth is you can't have to face it on complete all the time you'll be overwhelmed. So have to know when to broaden out the frame. Uhm, so let me just ask you one last question and I want you to think about this for a moment before you answer here. You've now watch this fil-- film and let me just ask you in the audience who, who by show of hands has no idea what I'm talking about when I ask the rest of you did you see the gorilla in the room? So let me just ask who did not see a gorilla in the room, please, please raise your hands it's, okay. It's okay. We'll laugh at you and then it will be all right. Raise your hands come on in shame raise your hands, it's okay. Now, I want you to look at this all these people-- who saw the gorilla, all right. So we have about-- people are, look there's some people didn't raise their hands probably they're going-- did we watch a film, is the what we did? I don't remember was there film up there that's interesting. All right. So, about half of the people who raise their hand saw no gorilla which is pretty amazing if you think about it there was a gorilla sitting right there during the entire video. Now, and let me just make a point if there's a gorilla in your office. It's probably important to see that shit. How could you miss it, it's sitting right, so I know people were going, "There was no gorilla this is some kind of trick this film here." I'm not gonna trust the thing this guy says in the future. Let me-- let me just back it up here we go, just really watch you for a second. Here we go watch. 

02:11:10
RICHARD You'll see that's Sara's(ph) card here has now got a blue back noticeably surprising... 

02:11:15
SCOTT D. MILLER By, by the way for those who of you, here now seeing the gorilla doesn't that remind you of supervision? Does it remind you when you're going, "Oh, shit, yeah." There it is. So, here's another way to deliberately practice. You've got to have other people watch your work, whose work you admire. Let me say it again. You've got to have other people watch your work whose work you admire. I'm not talking just about watching in an adult rate of fashion your videos you will fall dead from boredom if you do that. Number two, you will be so self-critical, you will disrupt what you do well. Let me say it again, this is not a recipe for taken video of your work and then watching them hour after hour. You know, a good-- whose a golfer in the room? Now, we got golfers in the room? If you are golfer you know how to mess up at the golfers game. Here's what you do, ask they're about ready tee off unless they're super practiced, as they're ready tee off. What you do is you say, hey, can I ask you a question. I'm just wondering cuz I've so admire your swing and I figure this some-- something to do with that. Do you breathe in or exhale when you swing? Think what we have done, we have switched this person from my system one effective system one process to system two. Now you're disrupted, you can't do the thing naturally that your normally do. So, I am not advising that you go video all your work unless you have an excellent coach like Rachel who can say that little piece of this video is the part you should practice. Are you following me? Otherwise there will be a flood of information that will be disrupted to the patterns that you use, ah, that actually work for you. Ah, the gorilla in the room is that process learning to find out when what we do, ah, needs to have some kind of adjustment. So, here we go, that's the experiment let me move on, ah, to the next slide hopefully-- there we go.

02:13:15
SCOTT D. MILLER How can you begin to figure out when you need to broaden your frame? How can you do that? Well, I said earlier you've got to measure in some way. And our team is created a very simple scale that can be use ongoing basis with your clients. Now, usually the first question that comes up is, do I need to use this scale with every client at every hour? I say, "If you want to know where your errors are you have to use it all the time," that's right. At least for awhile while your practicing these particular skill. You can access this scale for free on my website scottdmiller.com scroll down to the fifth bullet point which says performance metrics and you'll be able to download the scale in about 27 or 28 different languages everything from Arabic to Finnish, ah, most recently we translated it into Malaysian, ah, so that the scale exist if you want to use it and here's how it looks. Your gonna give this at the end of your visit. If you're working in the traditional outpatient's setting, the end of your visit and it's going to ask the client about the various components in the alliance. It's using a simple construct of the alliance developed in, ah, by Borden back in the 1970s. What is a good alliance? Three things, agreement on goals, agreement on task, uhm, ah, it does the client feel understood et cetera. Agreement on goals, agreement on task and does the client feel hurt? Have they-- have you responded them in empathic way? To that process we add something called preferences, uhm that are we providing services in a way that fit with clients view of themselves and we're ask the client to feel this out at the end of every visit. Uhm, you give it and the client can rate on each of four lines in various domains. Low scores, negative score here, positive scores here for the relationship goes on topics approach and method and then overall. Now, just so you know, each of these lines is or should be 10 centimeters in length. So, when you printed out on your home computer you wanna make sure that you measure it to ensure that they print out in 10 centimeters you are free to adjust them so that they-- so that they do. How do you score it? Clients put a mark. Low to this side, high to this side this simply put a mark on each of the four lines you get your metric ruler out and you measure in centimeters to the nearest millimeter of the clients mark. Let me say it again. Zero of the ruler here, zero to the nearest centimeter to the nearest millimeter of the clients mark. There are four, 10 centimeter lines total possible number of points is 40. We're measuring in centimeters to the nearest millimeter. And then here is the key, you're going to discuss the scores anytime the total score falls below 36. Ah, oh, there's was no, uhm, that is, let me say it again, let me say it again. You're going to discuss the total whenever it falls below 36. Uhm, talk to me about how that strikes you. It's like 95%, its very high and here's why. Scores on alliance skills are very negatively excu-- execute, meaning you can do a lot of stuff to people. You can kick them, uh, you can spit on them and you can pop in the eyes, and most of them will say, that was pretty good. You know, that I poking thing. I'm beginning to see things differently now. In other words most people score you high and score has meaning when the scores are less than perfect. When you get perfect scores it doesn't mean the client is thinking you're great. It might mean that but it can also mean can I go now? Are you with me here? That's what it might mean remember that person who said you-- yes you were the best. You were the best lover I ever had. High scores mean maybe, you're gonna have ask extra questions. Scores 36 or lower only 25% of the time you're gonna get scores like this. Sometimes people ask me are there cultural differences, ah, we have a study in Holland for example they found that the cut off was about 35. So, for me it says that right around that number and you start needing to be concerned there some small error that's going on here. Are you with me? And now let me give you one additional clue. Of course we would love it if the person they gave the-- they gave the mark would tell us what it means. You get three questions. After three attempts to understand what it means you become annoying. So you get three times to ask a question which means if you want to deliberately practice something, deliberately practice, asking questions that will get you to feedback you need to improve your performance. And you're gonna think that skills should just be part of your usual, ah, box of skills-- I'm telling you it won't be. In fact, you start using the SRS I'm gonna make a broad prediction for most of you. You will get perfect scores from almost all your clients. And then you will say, the measure doesn't work A or B the clients won't be on us. Can you hear the burden shifting, the burden of shifting back to the client why aren't they more on us? And the answer is they figure out you can't take it. All right. They don't wanna waste anymore time with you.

SCOTT D. MILLER Thirty-six can we do slides, thank you. Uhm, and we have skills for children this is valid from 12 down to eight right around there. We also have a young child version seven and younger by the way the adult version of the SRS is at the six grade reading level. Ah, so if you're were working with folks who may have cognitive limitations the-- these particular one right here is at the second grade reading level for kids. And if you have kids that have reading difficulties you can use the non-scorable version, let me say it again, non-scorable version. This doesn't have a number associated with it, uhm, but you can ask kids to fill out and all they do is simply circle the face that best fits their experience of the visit or they can draw their own face. And you just wait if you think kids won't tell you. Frankly I find kids much more willing to tell me how bad I am than the adults. It-- by the time you're adult you've learn to be polite and how to abide your time. Kids don't know yet that if they've tell you how you suck you're gonna have to talk more a-- about it. All right. So, they can circle or in the last case they can draw their own face. Now, honesty, how do we get an honest response on the SRS. The first thing is I would love it if you would just that word from your vocabulary. Honestly is not in them or in us, it's in the interaction. And so we've got to do things that invite people to do something that is not obviously in their self-interest, let me say it again. We're inviting people to engage in something that is not in their obvious self-interest which is to critic the person they're relying on for help. Are you with me? So, we've somehow got to get them to tell us how things really are, ah, about us in, in small ways. Remember small movements-- we're not talking about the low scores but the difference between 37 and 36, so we did a little study here. Uhm, this is the study that's currently being replicated in, ah, another large sample. This sample is giant. Look at it, 9,000 episodes of care. And here's what we have, we have outcomes effect sizes going up, ah, the, ah, vertical side here of the graph. And we have the different types of alliances at the first and last session. Let me give you more detail. The numbers going up vertically are effect sizes, the larger the number the bigger the effect size. The average effect size of psychological treatment is 0.8 to one, there's the average of psycho-- psychotherapist that have been tested so far. Along the bottom, we have the first alliance score and the last, so it started good and it ended good. Let me give you the score the actual scores. A good alliance score was a 39 or a 40. A fairer line score was 37 and 38. A poorer line score was 36 or lower. You see how tight the ranges here. One point movement and you are getting feedback even if the client can't quite put their finger on it. You've had the experience. You're at a restaurant and the meal just doesn't come together but what was wrong with it isn't immediately obvious. If the server came over and say, what don't you like about it? You know, the way you're likely to say, the whole thing, I don't know I can't parse it out actually what you're likely to say, it was fine, it was fine. Please, go away. Really.

SCOTT D. MILLER So, here we go along the bottom again we have good to good 39 to 40, 39 to 40 at the end. Fair to good 37, 38 at the beginning, ah, 39 to 40 at the end, poor 36 and lower to 39 and 40 good and so on. Does it make sense to you? Now, I want you to look at the graph in terms of effectiveness and tell me, which bar standout to you and in order to aide incomprehension I have circle the important one's. What one stand out to you talk to me? poor to good. Take a look at this poor to good has an outcome an average outcome. If you start poor and get good you end up with an outcome that is 50% greater than average. If-- now let me state that again. If you can get the clients to tell you early on that you suck, then you are in. It takes no talent to get the clients to tell how good you are, how meaningful it was. Now, now wait a second-- wait a second I know we are in many cases instrument to thinkers, we, we like models and methods as a field and so about six months ago I'm talking about this research and some guy raises his hand-- true story. I won't mention his name David but he, he is that's not what his name was Peter. Ah, he, he, he raise his hand and he says, he says to me, he says, wait a minute Scott, is that mean if what you're saying is true does that mean that I should purposefully make mistakes in order to get low scores. And I said, no you'll make enough by accident. The key here is to get them to tell you about those and that will take deliberate practice because you're asking clients to do something that is not in their apparent self-interest. Tell you the little parts that they didn't like about you even if you're sitting there and you're warm loving empathic, receptive, read it, tell me I can take it. Your clients will go, no. You really can't take it I promised you can take it. So, we got to get the clients to tell us that and then take a look at the opposite pattern, good to poor, good to poor. You end up with outcomes that are five times less than average and seven times less in the reverse pattern. So let me give you a little hint. Here is a system one-way of thinking. System one-way of thinking automatic unconscious. Well, it takes time for clients to align with me for me to build the relationship and tell me how they feel. If you're thinking that I promise you your outcomes are less effective than they could be. Now, it exact ly the right thing to say in the room if the clients scores go down and say, "Thank you." If that happen this is not the time to go, she sure in for about outcome now honey. Okay. Not the time to do that, not the time. That's gonna happened but you neither, neither should you accept that as effect to complete. You should not be saying that's perfectly fine. You know-- you need to do something to turn that score around. Clients do not take time to get to know us. How do we know that? Research, you can have an alliance that is just as strong at this moment when you first meet as it is three months from now. The key is being in the alliance at the level and type the client wants to have with you at this moment. Am I making sense? 

02:26:15
CULTURE OF FEEDBACK A Question INTERNATIONAL CENTER for CLINICAL EXCELLENCE 

02:26:15
SCOTT D. MILLER How do you gonna find out if you there, got to measure, got to measure you can use the SRS. So here's my question to you, think about this for a minute, when was the last time you were ask to give feedback? It may have been for these conference. It may have been at breakfast this morning. It may have been when you picked up your rental car, flew on the plane, check out of the-- of the hotel. Let me ask you, did you give it? So, let's do it. Last time fix that in your head you were ask to give feedback and did you do it. Yes, I did, look at the hands. No, I did not, look at this the knows when, and my question is why didn't you, why didn't you give feedback you naughty people? Why didn't you give feedback? Whatever your reason is, whatever your reason is this is the same your reason your client has for not giving you feedback now. That's what we have to overcome, am I making sense? And you'll be tempted-- you will be tempted to wing it. I beg you don't wing it will be depressing the results. So, let me just show you a short video of a clinician that, uhm, is actually one of our top performing clinicians and, ah, this particular clinician, ah, she, she would probably be here, she was at the last Evolution Conference, ah, but she had an accident unfortunately, uhm, and this in sort of-- injured at the present times so she couldn't be here at the Evolution Conference. Uhm, she's not somebody whose written a book. Ah, she's just a amazingly effective as a clinician. She, ah, and she works by the way with clients I think most of us would consider challenging. Ah, she works with clients who, ah, were tortured in their country of Oregon. Ah, in this particular person we notice early on had remarkable results. And so we started asking her questions and one of the questions was, how do you introduced this SRS forms to your clients. How do you do it? Uhm, interestingly enough we didn't tell her to use the form she just simply did, so let me just show you her, ah, form or her way of introducing the measure. Here's what she says, 

02:28:40
WENDY That bit on the back is crucial for me... for me to develop myself. As a therapist I' m already dependent on you That bit in the back is crucial for me... 

02:28:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Let me start this over again and hang on with me. And, and just say that this particular person her name is Wendy, and she works in the U.K. Uhm, and, ah, Wendy isn't just a little more effective than the rest of us. s he is like way effective and it doesn't matter who she's around. She has kind of a mildest therapeutic touch adults, children, alcohol and drug problems, trauma et cetera. She does it all. Uhm, and so at one point we just wanted to get in the room with her and talk with her. We learn that she was using the SRS, never attended the workshop she found it and was asking for a feedback. And so we ask her, "How do you introduce it?" And it was so different than how we the people who develop the scale introduce it. Here what-- here's what Wendy says. 

02:29:35
WENDY That bit on the back is crucial for me... for me to develop myself. As a therapist I' m already dependent on you 

02:29:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. She has this SRS on the reverse side of an outcome tool that she uses. She's laminated, copy them and laminated the copies and she uses a dry erase marker. And so she hands to-- this in form to the client at the end of our visit and she says, "That bit on the back is crucial for my professional development." Imagine these words coming of your mouth. It's not what's Scott Miller says Scott Miller says stuffs like, you know this form is designed to help me, help you better to get on your track, blah, blah, blah. Not when that she cut straight to the chase. Essentially what she's saying is, "Look, honey, I've been listening to you, yeber, yeber, about your problems for 15 minutes." Now, it's time for some give back, alright. I want to get on the road I wanna develop a little bit as a clinician here and nits on your shoulders. Ah, think about that it's kind of amazing, it's gutsy I think. 

02:30:40
WENDY ... for that bit on the back as I am on the bit on the front. So when we come to the bit on the back... I really do emphasize that this is not about pleasing me... or, ehm, helping me to feel good It's purely to help me to develop... 

02:31:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Think of all the things she is saying and by the way if you're not writing down what she saying what are you doing? You're not gonna remember this stuff I promise you won't-- she says, "This is about my professional development and by the way, I really the help I'm dependent on you to help move my skills to the next level. And I want to hear just how you experience it." And she goes on, here we go it will help me to develop. 

02:31:25
WENDY It's my professional development, and I need it Because I'll always be developing. 

02:31:25
SCOTT D. MILLER And I need it. By the way do you believe her? What is it about this woman? What is it did they just makes go let me criticize you straight away? What is it about here she just as vi-- I tell you what it is for me, Wendy is one of the most egoless people I've ever met. She is invested in you, she is not invested-- and you-- her investment in you makes her want to take the feedback regardless. Are you with me here? Cuz she seems strong enough to take it, it doesn't seem like she 's gonna be crashed. Ah, if she gets-- she doesn't say, I'd really like your feedback I really, really would, I really would. Please give me a feedback, you know, ah, ah, she doesn't do it. She's very congruent, here we go let's keep going. 

02:32:15
WENDY Ehm. A score of ten out of ten doesn't actually tell me anything... And it's actually quite unrealistic 'cause life's not perfect and neither I am 

02:32:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Think about this. She says, you know, a score of 10 out of 10 doesn't mean very much to me. Life is not perfect neither am I. I love this, she's, she's priming the pump here she's telling people, don't give me a 10. And surprisingly they don't, they don't give her a 10. Now, you know, me I am corporate this and I say, you know, "Life is not perfect we already know you're not perfect." So, I'm here to help you to get more perfect like me. Now, Wendy she says, life is not perfect neither am I, I don't know everything but I really wanna know. There's another way can add from another super performer. Here's what he said, he said things like this, you know, what it could be something big but most of the time it's not. It's the little things in life that usually drive us crazy overtime. And you may think it's so little it's not even worth mentioning cuz the just of that was pretty good. I beg you don't keep it to yourself. Get it down on the table and let's decide together whether it mean something. Are you with me? Listen to the comment here, these people they just don't have their ego on the table. What they're invested in is you getting what you came here for. When he says, a 10 out of 10 it doesn't mean very much to me, life is not perfect neither am I. And then the interviewer who is a lovely man, ah, Bill Andrews also from the U.K. ask her the following question, here we go. 

02:33:45
WENDY So it's an opportunity for you to help me to really develop as a therapist so... 

02:33:45
BILL ANDREWS And how do you find people engage with that Wendy? 

02:33:50
WENDY Very well. 

02:33:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Now, Wendy answers I believe in the-- I-- you-- you'll see when I play the rest of it. So, Bill ask her he says, you know, "How do you find people engage with that?" Uhm, ah, and, ah, the Wendy says, "Very well." What she's talking about is the clients. But watch what she says next. Watch what she says next. 

02:34:10
WENDY I do get some low scores... 

02:34:10
SCOTT D. MILLER She did as you know I do get some, ohhh, low scores. I love this, Wendy is embarrass by this in a way. She does get some low score she doesn't know at the time the this interview was done. What we know about her which is she was super effective. By the way, I can show you if you want what she said when we said she was super effective . Uhm, its, ah, it's, it's interesting but I don't think you 'll be terribly surprise by-- she said I do get some low scores, ohhh, and then she says... 

02:34:40
WENDY And I find that I don't get as consistently high as I'm aware many colleagues report. 

02:34:50
SCOTT D. MILLER I-- do you find, do you get it? I don't get this consistently high as all my colleagues are reporting. Her colleagues are when around going you know, you obviously have work to do Wendy. Not me I get 40s cuz I am superliner, you know, whatever it is. Amazing really. We could all work on the alliance, we can't engage everybody people are different, we can have some general skills, the idea here is find when you don't engage that person deliberately practice, think, make the plan, act and reflect. Am I making sense here? What could we act upon? What could we do, ah, to get better outcomes. Well, I'd like to turn back to Wendy and actually show you another piece that happened during the same interview. And what I-- as, as you listen I hope you listen for how she deliberately practices. Ah, these ideas in her work. So, she's talking about some feedback that she's gotten. Uhm, over the course of her career and use of the measures, so here's what she says. 

02:35:55
WENDY Another client who, ehm, marked the X The four marks weren't too low, but the top one heard understood, and respected again' was lower than the other three. 

02:36:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Now, think about Wendy I told you the cut off is 36. What that leads most of us to do me included is look for 36 and lower because we are rule followers we want to do it the right way. Are you following me here? But that's not what Wendy says, she says, the full box went to low, what she's saying is wasn't below 36. But the top one heard and understood and respected it was lower yet. So we're talking here about a quarter of a centimeter. Now, me Scott Miller I'm sitting in the office I'm kind of tired, have to go to the bathroom and the client gives me one quar-- quarter point or un-- understanding, right, and I think it's good enough to get out. What is Wendy think? It's a quarter lower, holy shit batman. I'd better find out what this is about. Are you with me? Now, listen to two things, listen to the types of questions Wendy frames and how she response to this questions. So, the top one was lower yet. 

02:37:10
WENDY And I said "I was just wondering about this" And the client said: 

02:37:10
SCOTT D. MILLER You know, I'm just wondering about this. Most people who ask questions for feedback they ask too big of questions. Just like at the restaurant when the person said, "How's the meal?" We mean like the whole thing at once or this little piece. It's up in the little that the drivers crazy when she say, I was just wondering about this one right here, a little quite right lower rate. That's what I wanna know about, that's what I wanna know about. Here we go. 

02:37:35
WENDY "No, no... it's nothing it's probably me." 

02:37:40
SCOTT D. MILLER So, Wendy says, you know, this one is quite a bit lower this one. And then client is no, no, probably nothing, it's probably me. Now, wait a minute. What does your traditional training tempt you to think at this point? That's right. It is you, inside is happening. That's why I'm sitting in the big chair. Not Wendy, watch what Wendy does, she's not satisfied we do it probably me tha client shifts the burden to her. Wendy says, "No." The alliance is not your responsibility 0% of the variability. The alliance is my responsibility, watch out she says. 

02:38:25
WENDY "I really would like you to be utterly be honest with me." 

02:38:30
SCOTT D. MILLER I-- what is Wendy do? She pleads and begs which is a much underrated treatment intervention. BPT, begging and pleading therapy. Please God will you do what I ask. Will you do it, please. I get down on my knees up already , whatever. Wendy pleads and pleads, please let me. Here's what-- here's what the client says. 

02:39:00
WENDY Something must have just been there. And she said, "well, it's probably nothing but... but it's just, ehm, it's your facial expression." 

02:39:15
SCOTT D. MILLER So the client I love how much she had this, she says, you know, the kinds of, wow, you know, she says, it's probably nothing, it probably about me, ah, but you know, if we got right to the chassis that face of yours. You know, that face who got I'd be change it if I didn't have to look at you. You think you can put a bag in that thing? Cuts some holes from their be unknown therapist. "Hi, how do you feeling?" Think about that. That some pretty hard stuff to hear isn't it? You know, I-- your face could stop the march of human progress. Now think about what you would say because I know what my traditional trai-- training attempts me to think. My traditional training attempts me to think, it's a transparence. Oh, oh, silly child how sick you really are. This is not about my face, this is about your toxic injured that's damn it. But not Wendy she's not gonna say that. Wendy is gonna say it's about my face. I've got to engage you that's my responsibility, are you following? She sees this is a deliberate practice opportunity in other words she doesn't ride system one on her theory. She takes system two what's happening at the moment. Clients giving me feedback I'm gonna take it, here we go. 

02:40:35
WENDY And I said, "On what, what, what do you think?" And she said, "Well it looks rather disapproving." 

02:40:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Oh, oh, oh, oh, it's even harder now. Not just sleep into this-- that into system one especially if the clients feedback it doesn't fit with yourself perception. Ah-ah, am I right about that, disapproving. I spit on disapproving. I am not disapproving, I have loving for having sex can't see you it I've listen to you for an hour. 

02:41:05
[sil.] 

02:41:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Not Wendy, not Wendy here what she says. 

02:41:15
WENDY And I said, "I'm very sorry, ehm..." 

02:41:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Wait a minute, what is Wendy say first? When was the last time he apologies. It's an important intervention, alliance bridge you know, you didn't feel like I understood, yeah, I'm sorry about that. Watt was it and say it again? That's powerful stuff man. I'm not talking about having apology is a sort of like, ah, yeah, ah, yeah, okay, I'm sorry. I'd got a bad news says I'm sorry. And I'm talking some I'm talking about mean in it when he says I'm sorry, I'm sorry and then she does something so cool. 

02:41:45
WENDY And I said "Could you help me kind of you know... if I can try and get it there to what it is 'cause I'm very, I'm so unaware of it." I said, "This is just fantastic!" 

02:41:55
SCOTT D. MILLER What? Think about what she does. She says, I'm so sorry and then she invites the clients for more feedback she's look, I don't know, I, I, I have no idea what I'm doing here. And so can you lets play this game I'm gonna make faces Wendy says, I'm gonna make faces and when you see the disapproving face will you show it to me that's what she's doing. And I love what she says, she says the kind this is fantastic. My face is causing you to be stock fantastic and the truth is you can't fake this shit. Wendy really means it tell me what's going on. So tell me what's going on so she plays this game when she says, just a second I gonna make some faces when you see so when it goes this are, are you ready? 

02:42:40
[sil.] 

02:42:45
SCOTT D. MILLER And the clients funny goes that's it. And he goes right here, like this. She says that's a face. When she says let me look at the mirror. okay, I see the face. And exactly what will Wendy says, they start doing this watch what Wendy says. 

02:43:00
WENDY And we had this funny little exercise, where I got this woman , but she's in therapy... And we were giggling away... And she said, "No, there it is! There it is!" And it was some weird, it was like... 

02:43:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. So what's happens Wendy sees the face. And they start to giggle. If Wendy is trying in the moment to overcome an alliance bridge in engagement error I can't think of much better way to engage people than to laughter. And specially at ourselves after all there so much material to work with, right? And so she says, she says, that's the face. And Wendy says this face right here. Wendy looks in the mirror and then she does something that most of us I'm talking me too included, don't do what does she do after the session ends? She does thank her after that. Yes, sir. She starts to ask somebody else about her face in a moment were gonna get to that. But you're on the right track. She's going to contextualized new knowledge because you have to know when does it apply and when it doesn't it apply. Are you with me? That 's the second step. Next step, she does validate. One more thing, she practices in the mirror. Everyday she shows up a work. This is what separates Wendy from the rest of it. You can teach this, you can't teach the none offensive smile approach to treatment. Don't ever hold your face like this. Clients are gonna upset with that. This is just BS I mean on its faces BS but think about the workshop you were then it's a lot like that. So Wendy gets in front of the mirror and she makes the face. And then she steps away from there she wipes the face clean while not looking in the mirror think Ben Franklin here. While not looking mirror she remakes the face she step in front of the mirror. When Bill ask her, "what the hell are you doing here? What way you doing that?" She says, "I didn't know I was making the face. I'm trying to feel it when it comes in my face." Are you with me here? She does this for six weeks. Now, let me ask you this when was the last time a client says something to you and it made you look in the mirror. If it isn't recent then no wonder our outcomes are on coast. Are you following me? I'm not saying it's easy but in the same time it's awful small if we did it deliberately over longer periods of time. Wendy eventually goes back and she's starts to contextualized. Here's what she does. She goes home and she is sitting on the davenport while my grandma stand-- Steenie used to call the davenport, the big a comfy couch in the front room. And she's waiting for a husband to come home. 

02:45:30
WENDY Anyway, wrapped it up... My husband came home from work and I rushed out... and I said, "John, John, could you tell me something about this facial expression?" 

02:45:40
SCOTT D. MILLER So she sit on the davenport waiting looking out the big picture window. Waiting for her husband to come home. And he pulls up in the drive way, uh-uh-uh, and what does she do? She rushes out. Okay, she doesn't sent her. She rush us out and she rushes up to John whose just pulled up and what is she going to do, show him the face. Think about this there is an immediacy to this she's going-- she's says, she was like, John have you seen this face? 

02:46:15
WENDY John, John could you tell me something about this facial expression? And he said, "Oh, I hated that!" He said, "That always drives me mad, that expression of yours." 

02:46:25
[sil.] 

02:46:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay, I hate that face. Alright. 

02:46:35
WENDY He said, that always drives me mad, that expression of yours. 

02:46:45
SCOTT D. MILLER He never mention that the bastard. Think about what she's done here. She's gotten his feedback and it would so attempting to bury her feedback in a basket of theory. Under why it was she was doing that, don't ask for client feedback and then do that to your client. Don't do it no wonder they won't give us feedback they know we can't take it. Then deliberately practice those small things. The message is good our outcomes are really good. That though once you're in the Olympic trials makes improvement even harder requiring more time and attention to count, ah, millimeter or a, a millisecond. Am I making sense? Thanks for listening for today, thank you very much. Thank you.
