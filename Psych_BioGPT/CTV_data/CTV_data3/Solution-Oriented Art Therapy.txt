00:30:15
JENNY Because it was like more visual, we had a map in front of us, and then he said, okay, I want you to write. And then, he gave us a map and then he numbered each of the states and then he gave us a piece of paper with two columns. One column, we write the state and the other column we write the capital. And it was just more a visual, so it was easier to put a face to a name. 

00:30:40
 Because it was more visual. We had a map in front of us and he said, I want you to write. He gave us a map he numbered each of the states and he gave us a piece of paper with two columns.

It was seventh time. And so it was kind of nervous. But I was like kind of -- I don't care anymore. I'm not going to pass it anyway, I didn't pass it before, why I get my hopes up and then, and I went in there, and I passed it. 

00:31:50
 It was -- Well, I didn't really care as much and before, every single time I had my boyfriend over and he'd check off all the ones I got wrong and he'll go over them and over and I still wouldn't pass and he'll laugh at me every time I didn't pass and he said, I'm gonna seriously tell everyone that you didn't pass.
