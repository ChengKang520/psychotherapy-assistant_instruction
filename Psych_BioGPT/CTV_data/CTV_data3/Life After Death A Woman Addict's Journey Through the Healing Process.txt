LIFE AFTER DEATH AN ADDICT'S JOURNEY THROUGH THE HEALING PROCESS 

00:00:15
God, 

00:00:15
grant me the serenity, 

00:00:15
to accept the things I can not change, 

00:00:15
the courage to change the things I can, 

00:00:15
and the wisdom to know the difference. 

00:00:15
Amen. 

00:00:15
Dr. Peter Martin Addiction Psychiatrist, Vanderbilt University 

00:00:15
PETER MARTIN Addiction really pertains to why the organism goes from point a to point b. The notion of free choice, the notion of choice, why do people choose, why do they- why are they in an out of control situation, in a situation that they know is self destructive? 

00:01:10
Sonny Sharp Facilitator, Restore Ministries 

00:01:10
SONNY SHARP We peel back the layers of the onion and we get to the real issues of, this is something that if I don't change it, is going to impair my recovery, or it's going to impair me feeling and acting the way I want to be, the kind of person that I want to be, the kind of person I want to be, the kind of husband I want to be, the kind of wife I want to be, and it's not hard to do. 

00:01:30
PETER MARTIN I believe that addiction is an illness like all other illnesses. I think that it is important for us to treat it as an illness, otherwise we make addicts, lepers. We don't want addicts to think that they don't belong to the human race, that they're unique. They just have an illness of their central nervous system. The role of the therapist, the role of the psychiatrist, is to help you understand, what in the environment is tripping your triggers. That can only be done by understanding what happens before you drink, why it is you drink, what are the origins of those feelings? Once you recognize that, you may be able to do something about it. 

00:02:35
SONNY SHARP Everybody comes with different challenges, but they realize very quickly, that each challenge is as life controlling for the individual as their personal challenges. I might come as an alcoholic, struggling with learning how to take control of my life back, somebody else might come with an eating disorder, somebody might come because of gambling, some people come because of internet pornography. It really doesn't matter, an addiction is an addiction is an addiction, and what happens these life controlling issues, they they handicap everyone of us from being hopeful and joyful and peaceful. 

00:03:25
PETER MARTIN Addiction is not just addiction to drugs, addiction, I tend to view addiction as a unitary problem of human drives. Now those drives were developed just for that purpose to help our species sustain itself. However, those drives an go awry, and in many ways it's those drives gone awry, that what- is what addiction is. 

00:04:00
Meet Angela Reed 

00:04:00
This is her story. 

00:04:00
ANGELA REED At the age of 11, my mother died of cancer, I didn't know really how to deal with that...being 11 years old and losing your mom, and that being your whole world, you just- I mean you're too young to understand, and- So, remember I got into the wrong group of kids at school, I was in middle school then, in fifth and sixth grade, and got in some kids, started smoking cigarettes, got to drinking, it progressed into smoking pot, before I knew it I was doing heavier drugs. I remember on my 16th birthday, calling dope man to get an eight ball of cocaine. A lot of kids celebrate their driver's license getting a car and all, all I was worrying about was getting high. 

00:05:20
Larry Reed Angela's Father 

00:05:20
LARRY REED During this period of time when she was on drugs, there was a lot of times that I would go from six months to a year and never know where Angela was, and never know what she was doing and most of the time when I would finally find out, where she was or what she was in to, was when she'd get locked up in jail. 

00:05:40
ANGELA REED I went to foster homes, school to school, skipped school, would come back to the foster home, hang out there, do dope all day long to the point when I was about 17 going on 18 I got into exotic dancing, being a stripper, and it was the fast life. You know, you make real good money, you get all the attention, you get what you think is love, drugs are plentiful in that nature of business, you just think you have it made. I was miserable, but to fill the void of course you just do your drugs. I thought the men loved me for me, and of course they didn't want nothing but the sex...All the girls that's in the same line of business, of course, did the same thing you do, and it got into the point that I had a man offer me a job at escort service. So, already having clientele, through exotic dancing, and exchanging sex for money, that was no big deal for me. He told me the money would be better, the hours would be less, the work would be less, never knowing the misery would be more. I got started in the escort business working three or four days a week. 

00:07:20
[music] 

00:07:20
Angela has five felony charges and over 172 misdemeanors for such crimes as distribution of narcotics, robbery, and prostitution. 

00:07:20
ANGELA REED You know ten or twelve hours at a time, you go out, you're with whoever, for whatever, you know, you just- you're in there with numerous men and you're at their beckoned call for their cash and money, just degrading yourself and you're so high on drugs you didn't care. Before I knew it I found out I was pregnant, back in- I found out I was pregnant in 2000. I thought this would really change my life, but it didn't. Went for a few months straight while I was pregnant, then I relapsed again, using drugs for several months while I was pregnant. 

00:08:15
Paula McClure Counseling Supervisor, Hope Center 

00:08:15
PAULA MCCLURE Her lifestyle was drugs, alcohol, selling drugs, prostitution, anything she had to do to get the drugs, she did it. She had one little boy that was taken away from her already. She had another child, a little girl, that while she was pregnant with that child, she was on drugs also, and so that child was born with drugs in her body. They had to take that child away from her, she never got to leave the hospital with her, and she still turned around that drug, that addiction, was so powerful in her life that she couldn't do it, she couldn't do it by herself. And she walked out of the hospital, and right back onto the street. 

00:09:15
ANGELA REED I remember riding down Dickerson road with my son in-between me and his father, smoking dope, hoping out of the truck, going to find a trick to make some more money, father would pick me back up, we'd go back to the projects or whatever to get our dope and do it all over while my few month old baby was riding right along with me. My son was found in a bed with a loaded, sawed off shotgun that night drugs was in the house, several folks were in the house using drugs, and I remember the day that DCS pulled up to take him. 

00:09:55
[music] 

00:09:55
ANGELA REED I had to hide, I had to hide in the closet from my son so he wouldn't know where I was at, 'cause all he kept hollering was where's my mama, where's my mama. They took him away that day, that's been the last time I've seen him. 

00:10:15
Laurie Lokey Counselor for Restore Ministries 

00:10:15
LAURIE LOKEY When they come to understand in the addiction area that if they're using the alcohol or they're using the, you know, food or relationships or sex or TV. or whatever it is, or work, that they're trying to cover up their pain, the pain of their losses. And so what I do with my clients, is I try to get to the core of the pain. Their addiction is just their symptom, it's just what they're doing to cope, but what is it that they're needing at their core, and that is usually to be loved. 

00:10:50
ANGELA REED I remember kicking, I remember kicking the windshield, I remember busting the windshield wide open. That was the last thing I remembered. Woke up later in the hospital found out a few kids had found me, this man had sliced my throat, and I was butt naked hung up in a tree with duct tape and rope, and he had left me there to die. Just, I remember just screaming out to god, please don't let me die, please don't let me die. Finally a car had come by and stopped, and called the police. They come got me and took me to the hospital again, they put me in surgery, removed the bullets from my legs. I had been shot three times in the back of my right leg, and I remember coming out of surgery and them having a monitor on my stomach. And I was like, what are ya'll doing, and I knew what kind of monitor this was, and they said well ma'am you're pregnant. And all I thought was this is all I need, not thinking about the well being of the child or anything, no. Didn't know who the father was, didn't care who the father was. 

00:12:15
PETER MARTIN It's not uncommon to have, most of my patients who are addicted, tell me that they grew up in a family where, you know, it was very very difficult for them. They were hurt, their family- you know, the mother was always out carousing, there wasn't enough time for the child, their needs weren't being met. And my collegues often say that addiction psychiatry is like child psychiatry, and adolescent psychiatry, because a lot of our patients, whether they're 30 or 40, are functioning at the level of early teens. There is lots of research that shows that people who, you know, little children, who are not cared for develop all kinds of problems, and there are changes in their brain chemistry, changes in their brain activation, changes in their level of trust, and trust is fundamental to recovery. 

00:13:25
Scott Reall Director, Restore Ministries 

00:13:25
SCOTT REALL In my own personal recovery, I mean, I tried, I failed, I tried, I failed, I tried, I failed. I mean, I just could not just stay, you know, sober, and then finally I- you know, that was working against me. Because every time I'd relapse, you know, I'd beat myself up and say you know what, you just need to drop out of this, and that's, you know, people can get very- despair there is deep, but what began to change for me was I began to say OK. Training versus trying, recycling versus relapse, and that almost you can expect, early on especially, that you probably are going to have slips, you are going to have failures, and in giving yourself permission that compassion that Carnes was talking about, is I extend myself compassion then Meridith Myers says, you know, giving yourself permission to get back. 

00:14:20
PETER MARTIN Look at patient for example, who has been in treatment five, ten, fifteen times, they always keep on coming back. That's why, I think, people like that really must have a careful psychiatric evaluation. Because usually patients like that have other illnesses in addition to addiction, other psychiatric illnesses, they could also have medical illnesses. Let's say a person has chronic arthritus, their pain continually makes them want to use drugs. What if we can treat some of that arthritis properly? So the point is we can't just put everything else out of our mind just because the person is drinking alcohol, we have to do a meticulous, comprehensive, medical, psychiatric evaluation. 

00:15:20
[music] 

00:15:20
In order to succeed you must fail, so that you know what not to do the next time. -Anthony J. D'Angelo- 

00:15:20
SONNY SHARP Most people see relapse as failure, and in addictive thinking, once I've failed I might as well go all the way. But in Restore, we teach, and were taught, that we're in training. We're not trying to change, we're training, and in training, if I want to run a four minute mile, I know I've got to go out there and run a bunch of miles, and it's not likely that they're all going to be four minutes. You know, there's times I'm going to fail, there's times I'm going to go out and practice, and I'm not going to do the time I did last week. I don't see it as a failure, I'm in training. So changing the approach to relapse, to show us that it's part of the training process, is a very healthy thing. 

00:16:20
SCOTT REALL The single most important factor, I believe, in recovery, is that the individual comes out of isolation and enters into a healing community, and in that healing community that is a safe place, he begins to be vulnerable, he begins to do this inward journey, build awareness around what is going on in their life, really looking into their hearts, and then when they begin to see the truth, they acknowledge it and then they set themselves on a course of committing to taking action. 

00:16:45
SONNY SHARP Yeah, you know, our god is a god of relationship, and one of the first things that goes when we enter in to cross that threshold into addiction, or any life controlling issue that handicaps us, is we lose the fellowship, we lose the relationship that's the first thing we start to isolate, and we lose that one on one bond with people who truly care about us. So, in these group settings, we find this place where people actually care about us. They don't know us except for what they've heard in this group, but what they see is what they see when they look in the mirror. That here's somebody that is being honest, that needs help and really wants to change and there's something encouraging about that. 

00:17:35
PETER MARTIN Addicts are not different from anyone else, so the whole notion of a single treatment program being the cure all, and the be all, be all and the cure all, is a major major misconception. These are chronic disorders, chronic relapsing disorders, that need to be managed rather than diluting ourselves that with one spiritual experience we will be better for all time. 

00:18:05
SCOTT REALL And see what we believe is that it is only in the context of a group process, a small, safe, group, where individual builds those safe relationships, that they can find accountability that they need, that connection. See I'm connected to my group 24/7. 

00:18:25
SONNY SHARP I think what this kind of structured program does with the right kind of facilitation, is it not only answers the questions what do I need to change, but it helps us understand how we can actually make these changes. And it encourages accountability, which most people with life controlling issues or addictions have always shied away from accountability. But accountability is so important, if I know that the next time I see you you're going to ask me, Sonny how you doing on that diet you're working on? [laughs] You know? Just knowing that you care about me, and knowing that the next time you see me you're going to ask me encourages me to stay on my program, you know, to keep doing it. 

00:19:05
[music] 

00:19:05
Back to Angela... 

00:19:05
ANGELA REED Me and one other girl ran the streets together, and we got a guy pick us up one night, we went to his house, we took a lot of jewelry from his house, we conned him in to going back out. I'd robbed him for several thousands of dollars that he didn't even know I had took. Me and the other girl, they called us a cab to go to a hotel, the guy pulled up in his truck, hopped out with a pistol, by this time he knew I had robbed him, or me and the girl as he thought, had robbed him. The girl was in the house getting some stuff, I was standing out front with the other guy that stayed in the car, the guy hopped out of the truck, pulled a pistol on me, and told me I was fixing to die. Shot at me, the guy that was standing beside me, we called him Bubba, and he shot him, it hit him. Blew his heart almost plumb out of his chest. And of course at this time again, I was pregnant for my third time running, you know, doing all this. When they told me he was dead it was just like something had smacked me harder than it ever had in my face. When the detective came back in I told him I said look, he said are you ready to go, I said no. He said what do you mean you're not ready to go? And I told him I said look, I've got warrants on me. You need to look me up, you need to go ahead and arrest me I'm pregnant, fout months pregnant I couldn't do it no more. I was tired. I was tired of the running, I was tired of losing the kids, I was tired of the misery, the loneliness, I was tired of all of it. I said this is it. 

00:20:55
PAULA MCCLURE At that point she prayed and asked the lord to be her savior, but she didn't have a lot of training, and she didn't really know where she was headed. She knew she did not want to go back to the street, and she said, she told me, her driving force was that baby that she was carrying. 

00:21:15
Rev. Rollie Grauman Hope Center Director 

00:21:15
ROLLIE GRAUMAN The recovery process of the Hope Center and it begins really in the family life center which is next door, where the lady calls they do an intake there. The woman says I may be a homeless person, says I'm sick and tired of this kind of life, and living on the streets and doing all this stuff. It may be a lady who's referred from another part of the state. 

00:21:40
About 126 women stay at the Hope Center each year. 

00:21:40
74% will not recover from their addiction 

00:21:40
ROLLIE GRAUMAN Or another part in another state where someone who has they've told somebody else who's told somebody else, and they've gotten help and they'll call and say I just need to get off drugs, I can't take this anymore. 

00:21:55
ANGELA REED I remember coming in these doors at the Nashville rescue mission, I came in with the clothes I had on, and a pack of cigarettes, and I remember praying OK god, this is the beginning of my journey, and wherever you lead me I'm going. This was going to be the start, I was going to dig into my program, I was going to be dedicated, I was going to do the right thing, I was going to be a good mother. 

00:22:20
ROLLIE GRAUMAN In the beginning we didn't know if she was going to make it or not, but then as she began to grow and develop it was just amazing to watch the changes, and then later in the program I learned all these things about had happened in her life and I had no idea, as, you know, maybe her counselors did, but I didn't. 

00:22:40
ANGELA REED I had prayed for so long, god I need something to direct my life, Mc Donalds is not where I want to be all my life. I need you to give me something to do, you know, something. I wanted to be in this kind of field of working with girls who had been what I'd been through. Giving them hope, you know that, you know I was on them streets in addiction for close to 20 years, showing them that it can be done. But it only can be done through the power of Jesus Christ too. I went online, got registered for Liberty, started my classes last week, been very blessed with them, they're very hard, my major I'm working on a bachelors in psychology right now. You know, I work full time, I'm a full time mother, now I'm a full time student. God has blessed me in many ways. Through this program I have learned strength and knowledge and wisdom and how to grasp hold of that anything could be done through the will of Jesus Christ. Isaiah, my son, is 17 months old now, and he's the highlight of my life. You know, my father and my family's in my life today, brothers and sisters back in my life...I know my daddy...my daddy use to say when he'd get a phone call from me he would think that it would be to come identify my body, and now today he tells me to quit calling him so much. [laughs] Cause I talk to him daily, you know, and it's just, it's a blessing. 

00:24:30
LARRY REED She has stayed straight, she's got her life back together, and she's joined a church, she's living for the lord, and I'm proud that Angela finally saw the light, and has got her life back together. She's doing good, she's a single mom, she works, she has her own apartment, she takes care of her kid, she takes care of her bills, she goes to church, and I feel like that Angela's on the right track. 

00:25:00
ANGELA REED I still have everyday struggles, it's hardly a week that goes by that you don't think about using still, you having using dreams, but it's the point of acting on it, of what to do, of how to handle it, of who to call out to. I take my job very seriously, I know that one thing I could say, could do, or do could make or break one of these ladies here. It could save their life. 

00:25:35
Tracee Smith 

00:25:35
TRACEE SMITH Angela helps me nurture myself spiritually, she loves my children, and Angela is like the first family that I've ever really had, you know, I had relatives but they're not family like Angela has been to me. Angela is blood to me, she's just incredible, she's incredible and I know that if Angela's my friend and if she's praying for me, I'm going to be OK. 

00:26:10
PAULA MCCLURE I love her like a child of my own, and she is going to do things. She's getting ready, she's studying right now, she's wanting to study psychology, she's wanting to give back to people what someone has given to her, and she's going to do it. She's got a determination in her, a fire in her heart, and a stubborn streak yes, but a stick-to-it-ness, and it's all for god. She's an inspiration, any woman in this program will tell you. 

00:26:45
ANGELA REED I never could do it without the lord, Jesus Christ. He is my number one, my son is my number two, you know, I'm number three [laughs] and I still have, you know, a struggle financially a lot, but my bills are paid and it just amazes me how sometimes I get to the end of a pay period and I wonder how I'm going to make it, and god always supplied a way. He has always supplied a way for me. 

00:27:20
PETER MARTIN There's very, very, good data that shows, that people who go through treatment, you know, who undertake to- who undertake to challenge their addiction. Do better than those who don't. 

00:27:45
SCOTT REALL There's three keys in, I believe in, in recovery. Number one is consistancy and consistency is not that you do it right every time, but consistency is you just keep showing up, and I did that. For eight years I just kept going to my groups, I kept connecting with my people, no matter how bad I was doing or how good I was doing, I kept showing up. Second piece to that is time, you know, a lot of time started to go by, a year, after year, after year, and slowly god started to get things clear to me and began to work this process of changing me and I had the time also just for me, to grow and to mature in my recovery, and then the third part of that is grace. Grace is the most powerful force in the universe and that consistency of showing up and giving god time, and myself time, being in god's grace, he transformed me. 

00:28:45
LAURIE LOKEY There is a process of recovery, and- and it's more than just doing good and doing right and not taking that next drink even though that's a part of it. Many times I would go to church and I would say, you know, why they- I had been told I'm just sinning, I'm sinning against god, and what I have learned is that didn't compel me to get well. It wasn't- I didn't want to sin against god, I wanted to be well. 

00:29:20
PETER MARTIN These are very tall tasks, very hard tasks to accomplish, and by helping people put their lives in order and help them develop some of the skills and some of the attitudes that they didn't develop when it was their time to develop them. People can become better, people can recover, people can have fulfilling lives that are balanced, that are where they develop relationships that are fulfilling. 

00:29:55
SCOTT REALL I don't believe there is failure, we you know, it's going to be a process of growth over time, two steps forward and one step back and eventually it begins to take really root, and the positive part of my recovery starts getting stronger, and stronger, stronger and finally, what I believe is that through that community, through continuing to train, I start to believe that you know what, I am changing and I am becoming this new man. 

00:30:25
PETER MARTIN There are so many things humans share, and the most important thing is the need for other humans, and the capacity to learn from each other and the capacity to help each other. 

00:30:40
SONNY SHARP It's what fuels all of the change and all of the process that we go through, is realizing that I can't do this if I could do this, I'd have done it a long time ago. So here I am when I tried hard and it didn't work, I tried harder. When I worked long and it didn't work I worked longer. You know, when I didn't think I had enough information, I got more information. But soon I came, well soon, 27 years for me, I came to the realization that my way wasn't working and that I needed help. 

00:31:15
PETER MARTIN The serenity prayer is an extremely valuable, monumental insight...It just means that we need to recognize that there are some things that are under our control, and there are other things that never will be. If we know the difference we can devote our energy to the things that we have some power over, and let the rest go. Don't beat yourself up, and understand, understand, understand what made you the way you are, so you can do something about it. 

00:32:00
[music] 

00:32:00
PETER MARTIN So you can parcel it in to little bits, that are amenable to some change. 

00:32:05
LAURIE LOKEY You can not surrender to angry, judgmental, condemning god. But you can surrender to a god who says because I have loved you, I died for you, and that's where change occurs. Don't give up, don't give up, keep coming back, there is hope and I will tell you I have been without hope and there were people who stood by me, and walked with me, and said don't give up. 

00:32:40
ANGELA REED God, I just can't emphasize how much god has really blessed my life, I just, that's about really it you know. I was tired, I got it together, and because of the lord Jesus Christ I'm where I'm at today, so... 

00:33:00
SCOTT REALL Never ever give up, because god will never, ever give up on us, god will make a way. 

00:33:10
[music] 

00:33:10
God, 

00:33:10
grant me the serenity, 

00:33:10
to accept the things I can not change, 

00:33:10
the courage to change the things I can, 

00:33:10
and the wisdom to know the difference. 

00:33:10
Amen.
