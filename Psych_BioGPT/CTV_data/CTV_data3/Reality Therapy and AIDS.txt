00:05:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:05:25
JOHN I would have found something. You know, I'm recovering alcoholic. I mean, that's, you know, no big deal to give up an addiction. This time, it's kind of like an ambivalence, you know, like what am I giving it up for, okay?

00:06:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:06:15
JOHN  When you're no longer, you know, up and, and vibrant and, uhm, a participant in life. And I... (crosstalk)

00:06:45
JOHN Uh hmm. 

00:06:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Well, how realistic is it for you to abandon all those feelings and that kind of turmoil that you have? 

00:06:55

DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:07:15

00:20:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:20:10
JOHN ...I said in the beginning. 

00:20:10

JOHN I'm not real comfortable with what I'm doing. (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:20:15
JOHN And, you know, if, I'd rather be in Philadelphia or... (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Yeah. Sure. Sure. Sure. 

00:20:20
JOHN ...anywhere else that, that where I'm at right now. 

00:20:20
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sure. 

00:20:20
JOHN And I thought that I have, you know, the, the coping mechanisms and all that to really handle this thing and I don't. (crosstalk) 

00:20:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:20:25
JOHN You know, and it is really, it's really... (crosstalk) 

00:20:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:20:25
JOHN A tough thing to say. It's like I don't know if I can make to the end of the road on this thing. (crosstalk) 

00:20:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, Uh hmm. 

00:20:30
JOHN You know? 

00:20:30
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Well, who does have the coping mechanisms? 

00:20:35
JOHN I don't know. I mean, we, we, we tend to, like in society... (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sure. 

00:20:40
JOHN ...like glorify death that, you know, everybody goes out and just this wonderful, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:20:40
JOHN ...sunny little way with, you know, with, surrounded by family. I just don't see that happening. (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:20:45
JOHN  You know, and I'm scared to death of this thing. 

00:20:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:20:50
JOHN Uhm. 

00:20:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Well, what, what I'd like to, to, to ask you about is, and talk about is some ways to lessen the fear. I don't think, I don't think there, the fear is gonna go vanish and, and, you know, you're gonna just be eager to, to, to face all of this but I think that it might be less painful. And, and ah, the way I look at it is that the more you do things and you've identified a number of those things, the more you do those things, the more pause you get. And can put this on hold. I mean, you're not one to deny it, the, the sweep it under the rug... (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
JOHN No. 

00:21:25
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...and, my goodness, look at all the things you're doing to, to confront it. But the, but maybe it's just real, more realistic to have a pause and to increase that pause from an hour to an hour and 15 minutes to an hour and a half. So that, it makes those moments and hours that you, that you talk, think about it more bearable. 

00:21:40
JOHN  Yeah. That's what I'm trying to do. (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:21:45
JOHN And, and now, this is a period where my energy's coming back up and I can do it. (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. 

00:21:50
JOHN You know, it's, it's, uhm, coming out of a bad period into, (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:21:50
JOHN uhm, okay period, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hhmm, how do you know that? 

00:21:55
JOHN I can tell. (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:21:55
JOHN I mean, I can tell. You know, I've, I've been on the go today since 6:30 this morning... 

00:22:00
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:22:00
JOHN ...yesterday, I, I would have, if I gotten up at 6:30 and... (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:22:05
JOHN ...by eight o'clock, I would've been back on the couch. (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:22:05
JOHN It's, you know, you, you get to know your body after... (crosstalk) 

00:22:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sure. 

00:22:10
JOHN ...a while. 

00:22:10
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sure. Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:22:10
JOHN You know, your blood work tells you one thing but your own body tells... (crosstalk) 

00:22:15
DR. ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. 

00:22:15
JOHN You a whole lot, too. (crosstalk) 

00:22:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. Uh hmm. So, these things, when you do these activities that really... (crosstalk) 

00:22:20
JOHN Uh hmm. 

00:22:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...are, maybe not direct communication but they're kind of altruistic activities. Use, you, you were able to kind of put this in the background. 

00:22:30
JOHN Yeah, yeah. 

00:22:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:22:30
JOHN  For a while. 

00:22:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING For a while, for a while... (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
JOHN For a while. Yes. 

00:22:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. And I'm thinking maybe if you can do them a little more often, would they help you or hurt you? 

00:22:40
JOHN I think they would help. I think the one thing that I tried to do altruistically... (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:22:45
JOHN ...is in my relationship and with other people, is not talk about my feelings. 

00:22:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:22:50
JOHN And not, you know, like, uhm, try to go through this as a hero. Uhm. 

00:22:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hmm. How's that work? 

00:23:00
JOHN (laughs) Oh, it quite not hasn't, I mean, you know, uhm, you know, but I mean not to open up to, now I cry in front of people. 

00:23:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Yeah. 

00:23:10
JOHN Now, I tell them... (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:23:10
JOHN You know, uhm, I don't look, I don't feel well, you know? 

00:23:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
JOHN And Kevin will always say, "But you look so healthy." And it's like, "What do you want me to do?" I mean, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Right. 

00:23:15
JOHN  uhm, you know, but I, I, I'm, but I don't, you know, like I have this whole people pleasing thing, too, that I don't wanna sound like... (crosstalk) 

00:23:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:23:25
JOHN ...a whiney, sick person. Okay. You know, I don't wanna ask for help, all right? 'Coz it's been incredibly... (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sure. 

00:23:30
JOHN ...slow in coming. 

00:23:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Yeah. 

00:23:35
JOHN You know? Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, it's a new task for you. I mean, it's a new, it's a new responsibility. 

00:23:35
JOHN  Yeah, one that I don't like. It, it even makes dying look pretty good. 

00:23:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
JOHN Yeah, the problem with there's, I met a point, too, where I'm ambivalent about dying. Uhm, there's part of me that just feel like ten years is enough. 

00:23:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:23:50
JOHN You know, uhm, I feel like I've been through a washer for, for ten years... (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:23:55
JOHN ...and I'm tired. 

00:23:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:23:55
JOHN You know, and I'm, and, and that's the only way I can, I'm physically and I'm psychically tired. And I'm out of tricks. 

00:24:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
JOHN  You know, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING When you ask for help, does that do anything to this fatigue? Does it less. (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
JOHN Yeah, it does. 

00:24:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING  What does it do? (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
JOHN Yeah, it does. It lifts. It does. (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Oh. 

00:24:10
JOHN Yeah, yeah. When I, there, I'm, I'm into this thing that, that if I can say, I can only do. (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:24:15
JOHN  You know? I can partialize what I can do when I set boundaries. You know, I don't get the anxiety that goes along with the fatigue. But if I don't, what I find is that I don't sleep well the night before, you know, uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:24:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:24:30
JOHN ...but if I'm able to say this is all I can do now, you know, this is where John's at. (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING So, it helps you physically, emotionally? 

00:24:35
JOHN Right. Right. Yeah. 

00:24:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Probably, intellectually in some ways. 

00:24:40
JOHN Yeah. 

00:24:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You might be able to think clearer? 

00:24:40
JOHN  Yes. 

00:24:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:24:45
JOHN Yeah. 

00:24:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING So asking for help, asking for help and doing kind of altruistic things or, for want of a better word, distracting things... (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
JOHN Right. 

00:24:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...seems to help you escape this kinda dark cloud. 

00:25:00
JOHN Yeah. And winter's over. 

00:25:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Maybe that's all you can do is escape it for a little while. 

00:25:00
JOHN  I know, that's it. You know, I think that everyone though wants to... (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING I mean, rather than feeling good about all this, how, how realistic is that? 

00:25:10
JOHN It isn't, it isn't. I mean, it just doesn't. Uhm, I think that I've just tried to feel good about it. I think I tried to, you know, to stress that, you know? 

00:25:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
JOHN Uhm, I think I'm just asserting(ph) that a positive attitude means accepting the fact that I am going to die. You know, accepting the fact... (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:25:25
JOHN That there may not be new medications and that, you know, that, that, you know, my life may end in the next year, two years, or whatever. And I'm not happy about that. But before, it was like... (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:25:35
JOHN  You know, like. (crosstalk) 

00:25:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING But we don't know. 

00:25:40
JOHN No, I know. I know. Now, there may be a cure around the corner. 

00:25:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hhmm. 

00:25:45
JOHN But I'm so tired of that. 

00:25:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You got to that? Yeah. But, but with cure or no cure, you got today, you got tomorrow? 

00:25:50
JOHN That's true. 

00:25:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hmm. I mean... (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
JOHN  That's true. 

00:25:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...this long range, how's this long-range planning and thinking, how's, where's it getting you? 

00:26:00
JOHN It's getting me nowhere because I can't do it. 

00:26:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING It's kind of increasing the pain, though. (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
JOHN It is. And the anxiety... (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:26:05
JOHN And the, and frustration and, yeah. It's just I'm becoming aware of that... (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:26:10
JOHN That you know, that, uhm, you know, getting back to it day by day thing and... (crosstalk) 

00:26:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. Do you have a program or like a program, a day-by-day program you can read and think about? 

00:26:20
JOHN Yeah. I have them. I have them. There's a, there's a good one, actually, that's written for AIDS. 

00:26:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:26:25
JOHN And I do read it, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You read it every day? 

00:26:25
JOHN Not every day. But I, I read something... (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
JOHN ...inspirational every day. 

00:26:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. Uhm, what do you think about reading some kind of philosophy built around just for today every day? 

00:26:40
JOHN It's fine. I mean, I've done it for a number of years. So. (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. You know, I start off the day every day with a, you know, " Just for the day, I live through this day only." 

00:26:50
JOHN Yeah? 

00:26:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You know that philosophy? 

00:26:50
JOHN Yes. 

00:26:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:26:50
JOHN Yeah. 

00:26:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING  I read that every day. 

00:26:55
JOHN I, I should practice it a little bit more. It's just getting, now, (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hmm. 

00:26:55
JOHN  just like a little overwhelming of the future, you know? 

00:27:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You should, I don't about this should... (crosstalk) 

00:27:00
JOHN Yeah, I should. 

00:27:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...should, but, uhm, well, I'm able to lessen my anxiety and fear with just that little, a few percentage points as a result of reading that. It doesn't cure anything but I just thought I'd throw that out. 

00:27:15
JOHN No, it's a great idea. (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hmm. 

00:27:15
JOHN It's one probably that, that I should. 

00:27:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Not should. 

00:27:20
JOHN Well, I've tried, I've done before, you know, but sometimes you just like, well, you know, it doesn't work. 

00:27:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hhmm, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:27:25
JOHN You know, there's anger and like... (crosstalk) 

00:27:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:27:25
JOHN ...all thing's not working and buttons... (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Oh, that's the time you read it? 

00:27:30
JOHN Your own buttons aren't there. You know, your own buttons are moved. 

00:27:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:27:30
JOHN Uhm, and you're not even aware of where your own buttons are, anymore. You know, so that there's nothing to push for the joy button anymore. 

00:27:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:27:40
JOHN You know, and I have to find that somewhere. And there's, there is, you know? 

00:27:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, can you find it in just searching for a feeling? Can you find it in searching for a thought? Or can you find it by doing something? Which is easier? 

00:27:50
JOHN  I think at different times, I can do it all three ways, okay? Uhm, sometimes the most difficult is doing something because of fatigue. 

00:28:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Oh yeah, yeah. 

00:28:05
JOHN Okay. 

00:28:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING But I mean, when you feel like it? 

00:28:05
JOHN But, yeah. I mean, the thing is that what I want is stability. You know like just let me, let there be consistencies... (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. 

00:28:10
JOHN So I can do so much, even just two hours of good health a day, that, that's, that's fine. Uhm, I can find it, though, on that, I can block it. I can block ideas. You know, thoughts when I'm not feeling well. 

00:28:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:28:25
JOHN It's actually, I'm able to cope with things much better when I'm not feeling well than I am when I begin to feel better. 

00:28:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Uh hmm. 

00:28:35
JOHN Okay. 

00:28:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Do these things just kinda rise up, you know, in, in mind? (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
JOHN No, it's in the agenda that's been going on for, you know, for uhm, you know, yeah, the, the. (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING What I mean, during the day, the feeling, does it just come, come over? (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
JOHN No. It's, it's induced by something. 

00:28:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Oh. 

00:28:45
JOHN It's something that happens. I mean, you know, ah, health concerns happen after a doctor's appointment... (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:28:50
JOHN And, and, you know that. I mean, I can pin it to something. You know, uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
JOHN ...financial stress comes after a bill comes in that, you know, that ah, insurance didn't pay for, you know, or prescriptions that aren't paid for under my program... (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:29:05
JOHN ...but, you know, they're coming out of pocket. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Okay, I wanna ask you about another question. What about your, ah, family? I think you have some brothers and, ah, your mother's still living? (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
JOHN Yeah. Uhm, boy, you rough one, we, my mother is 86 years old... (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
JOHN ...and born in Ireland. Uhm, she's an alcoholic. 

00:29:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:29:30
JOHN  Uhm, although she doesn't admit that and, uhm, when I applied for Social Security in 1993, uhm, I was working in a hospital and I was really getting beat up in my work. And I was not feeling well at all. And I just said, you know, this is my time. I made the decision. 

00:29:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Uh hmm. 

00:29:55
JOHN Uhm, my mother cut me off. And. (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. Do you wanna get closer to her? 

00:29:55
JOHN  I'm afraid to get closer to her. We're, we have a relationship. She, ah, fell and broke her leg last year... (crosstalk) 

00:30:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:30:05
JOHN ...and, uhm, I sent her flowers. You know, that was a first movement. (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING When have you seen her? When have you seen her? 

00:30:10
JOHN I'll see her Easter. I'm having the family for Easter. 

00:30:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING When was the last time you saw her? 

00:30:10
JOHN  Uhm, I saw her at a fune, her sister's funeral in January. 

00:30:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING So, you see her about three or four months? 

00:30:20
JOHN No, I'd say a little bit, maybe every one or two months. 

00:30:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. 

00:30:20
JOHN  She doesn't want to get close either. I'll call her... (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, that's my question. (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
JOHN Yeah. 

00:30:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Do you want to be closer? I said do you want to and you said you're afraid to. 

00:30:30
JOHN I'm afraid to be close to my mother. 

00:30:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:30:30
JOHN Uhm, I, my mother is someone who's not very accepting of me. She's very, you know, very much the Irish matriarch in the family. She controls all of her sons, you know, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. So are you saying you'd, you know, there's nothing you wanna do about this? I mean, maybe close isn't the word. Do you wanna spend some time with her? 

00:30:50
JOHN  Do I want to? 

00:30:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:30:55
JOHN No. 

00:30:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
JOHN No. 

00:30:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Let's talk about. (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
JOHN No. to be honestly, I don't. 

00:30:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING  All right. All right. But let's talk about your brothers. What about them? Do you wanna spend time with them? 

00:31:00
JOHN  Yes. Actually, we're beginning to establish a relationship... (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:31:05
JOHN ...away from my mother. Uhm, and, ah, it's, it's going well. Uhm, my older brother and I are like only 21 months apart so there's always sibling rivalry and, and... (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:31:15
JOHN ...a lot animosity. And we've pretty well buried that. And he is being... (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:31:20
JOHN ...for the first time, nice to me... (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:31:25
JOHN ...in all my life. And uhm, it feels pretty good. And we're, we're able to be honest with each other. You know, instead that I'd, you know, like it was easier, life was easier without my family for the five years. It really was. (crosstalk) 

00:31:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING So, when was the last time you saw him? 

00:31:35
JOHN Uhm, I saw him at my aunt's funeral in January. 

00:31:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. 

00:31:40
JOHN I'll see him again on Easter. 

00:31:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. So, uhm, you know, my, my thought is that when you increase relationships, which you want to increase, if you don't want to... (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
JOHN Uh hmm. 

00:31:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...then that, that's, ah, that's another thing. But if you want to in, ah, ah, to spend some time with these people around you, this is going to help lift some of this, ah, fatigue and some of these upset feelings. 

00:32:00
JOHN  I have like an extended family, though. I mean, the thing is... (crosstalk) 

00:32:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:32:05
JOHN ...that when, when you kind of like have a breakdown of the family like we had. 

00:32:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:32:10
JOHN You know, it could've made me fall apart. It didn't. 

00:32:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:32:10
JOHN It made me stronger. 

00:32:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
JOHN Uhm, and I have some really good friends that are family. 

00:32:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Uh hmm, yeah. 

00:32:20
JOHN You know, uhm, and it's kind of like we're before my family was very important to me. 

00:32:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:32:25
JOHN  Way too important to me. 

00:32:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:32:30
JOHN You know, they're, you know, they're way too value-laden. 

00:32:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
JOHN It's not there anymore. 

00:32:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. So you don't wanna spend time. (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
JOHN No, I, I'm glad to spend some time with them. 

00:32:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. 

00:32:40
JOHN But I, I do spend quality time... (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. Okay. 

00:32:40
JOHN ...with other people and get my emotional needs from other people. 

00:32:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. Well, that's what I'm, that's what I'm asking. 

00:32:45
JOHN Yeah, yeah. It just, kind like a family, it's like right now, it's like I'm glad I did what I did. But it's very stressful. 

00:32:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
JOHN They're, you know, they're more stressful than they are. (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. Okay. 

00:32:55
JOHN You know, stress reducing. 

00:32:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sure, sure. Well, you don't need any more stress. 

00:32:55
JOHN  No, I guess not. 

00:33:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING So the extended family that you have... (crosstalk) 

00:33:00
JOHN Uh hmm. 

00:33:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...and you spend time with them? See them often? 

00:33:05
JOHN Uh hmm. 

00:33:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. They're friends that... (crosstalk) 

00:33:05
JOHN Yeah. 

00:33:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...come over and, you know, you talk with them, go to their houses and... (crosstalk) 

00:33:10
JOHN Right. 

00:33:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...things like that. 

00:33:10
JOHN Right. 

00:33:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING That, is that satisfactory to you? The way it's working now? 

00:33:10
JOHN  It's hard, I think the hardest thing is this having, uhm, you know, most people are working during the day and having uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:33:20
JOHN ...a long day. That's the hard thing. 

00:33:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You have a long day. 

00:33:20
JOHN  Yeah. Yeah, I do. 

00:33:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. So, what are you gonna do tomorrow to make it a short day? 

00:33:30
JOHN You know, I haven't even thought about it. It's a, an interesting thing that I kinda stop thinking about tomorrow. Uhm, well, we're a week before Easter and, uhm, I've, you know, I'm kinda like excited about having the family. (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. Uh hmm. 

00:33:40
JOHN So, I'm, and I'm learning to like slow things down so I don't do everything, you know, try to do everything in one day... (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. Sure. 

00:33:50
JOHN ...and then be exhausted for two days. 

00:33:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, what will you do that would restrict, re, re, reduce the turmoil and the stress just maybe like five percent? 

00:33:55
JOHN I have like three or four errands a day that can be done tomorrow even though... (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:34:00
JOHN ...it's a week before, you know, that can be done ahead of time. And I'll do those. Uhm, and be out and that I, I have this part time job of. (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:34:10
JOHN You know, graduated from college to become a dog walker. But I like... (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Oh. 

00:34:10
JOHN  the dog, It's just kinda fun. And it, and I'm with the dogs so. (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING And you're not so upset when you do that? I mean. (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
JOHN No. I like, it, it, you know, when I can get outside of myself... (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. 

00:34:20
JOHN ...and get in to that two dogs that are these big things that I'm afraid they're gonna knock me over, you know? Ah. 

00:34:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sounds like maybe you need to find more dogs? 

00:34:30
JOHN Yeah, there's a possibility that maybe my career now as a dog walker... (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You know, see, I have a little motto, if something works, do more of it. 

00:34:35
JOHN Yeah. That's ah. (crosstalk) 

00:34:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING If something doesn't help, do less of it. 

00:34:40
JOHN I like that. 

00:34:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING It's the essence of the kinda counseling, the work that I do. (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
JOHN Okay. I think what I've done is... (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING It doesn't matter and we're not... (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
JOHN ...kinda like knocking my head against the wall... (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING And. 

00:34:45
JOHN ...and trying to make something work. 

00:34:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. And maybe stop worrying about dealing with this thing. 

00:34:50
JOHN  How do I do that? 

00:34:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING By doing more of what those work. 

00:34:55
JOHN Okay. 

00:34:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING  That's why I said, if you were good at denial, we'd be trying to help you deal with that, but you're not good at denial. You're, you're good at taking it on board. So, maybe, maybe the opposite is better for you, is to, to, to do some things that would distract you. I mean, that's something against your. 

00:35:15
JOHN You know very much, though. 

00:35:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:35:20
[sil.] 

00:35:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Relationships, activities, maybe some self-talk like when, when you're afraid and you start, you know, these things start bothering you. And just saying, "I'm gonna put it on hold for a few minutes. I'll put it on hold 'til five o'clock." 

00:35:45
JOHN Yeah. Yeah, that is, I've tried. 

00:35:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Have you tried that? 

00:35:50
JOHN Yeah. 

00:35:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING How's that work? 

00:35:50
JOHN It works well. I think the other thing... (crosstalk) 

00:35:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:35:50
JOHN ...too, of just saying to someone else... (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hhmm. 

00:35:55
JOHN ...I'm frightened? 

00:35:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:35:55
JOHN Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Communicating the relationship. 

00:35:55
JOHN You know, of, uhm, you know, breaking... (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:36:00
JOHN ...down to being human, (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:36:00
JOHN you know, of saying this is overwhelming and it's ghastly and, you know, uhm, and I don't know how to handle it. 

00:36:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Yeah. Yeah. Is any consolation, I don't, I don't know if this is useful comment or not. But is it any consolation to know that almost nobody can handle these things? 

00:36:20
JOHN Yes, it is. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:36:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING How can we handle this? We have no training for this. All of our training in all of our lives is built just to live. 

00:36:30
JOHN Yeah. 

00:36:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING  And none, none of it's, but, we don't, we're not... (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
JOHN No. 

00:36:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...equipped to deal with these as human beings. I'm not trying to brush it off or anything but. 

00:36:40
JOHN  You're not. 

00:36:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hhmm. 

00:36:45
JOHN I think what you're saying is, uhm, you know that I don't have... (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hhmm. 

00:36:50
JOHN ...to this perfectly. And that there is no book and there's no course, you know, uhm, and there's no road, and, uhm, you know, you can read Bernie Seagal and it helps. 

00:37:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:37:00
JOHN And, you know, you can read a thousand different things, but it's, it's in a unique. (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING But Bernie is not John. 

00:37:05
JOHN  No. Exactly. That's what I was trying to get to it along the way. 

00:37:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:37:10
JOHN You know? 

00:37:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING  But you can do some things. You can reach out to these people. You said it helps. That's your judgment. You can schedule in you upsetness for the later in the day. 

00:37:25
JOHN Yeah. 

00:37:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING And this reminds me of a situation I had talking to somebody some years ago and, he was worried, it wasn't, you know, ah, ah, like your situation. But he was worried and constantly worried, constantly worried and, and he scheduled in worrying for ten minutes a day. And when he felt these worries coming over him, he'd say, he'd say to himself, "I'm gonna put them on hold 'til five o'clock." 

00:37:50
JOHN Hhmm. 

00:37:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING He called me after doing this for three weeks. And he made this unsolicited comment to me. He said, "The last three weeks had been the best three weeks I've had in ten years." 

00:37:55
JOHN  I like that, though. I like that... (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. 

00:38:00
JOHN To, to schedule a time for worrying. 

00:38:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Hhmm. 

00:38:00
JOHN So I think the, the problem is this that before I had things to fight for, I had to fight to get Social Security and they got me (inaudible )... (crosstalk) 

00:38:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. You had a crusade. 

00:38:10
JOHN And I don't have anything now. 

00:38:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING It's a whole new... (crosstalk) 

00:38:10
JOHN Yeah. 

00:38:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING ...life for you now. 

00:38:10
JOHN I mean, that's like a new, you know, ah, ah, it's new now. 

00:38:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING It's a new life. 

00:38:15
JOHN Yeah, yeah. And I don't like it. (laughs) And that's a big step, though, just to say, "I don't like it." (crosstalk) 

00:38:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING I know, you're right. 

00:38:20
JOHN  You know. 

00:38:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING I know, that's a courageous step. 

00:38:25
JOHN Yeah, yeah. I think what I've, I'm kind, gathering from this is that there's a lot of reasons I haven't quit smoking. 

00:38:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING  Uh hmm. 

00:38:40
JOHN You know? 

00:38:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:38:40
JOHN But I do have, that's one, I do have the tools inside. I'm starting the process... (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. Uh hmm. 

00:38:45
JOHN ...but, you know, uhm, some people who watch this tape will, ah, will be chagrined when I say easy does it is actually the thing that's gonna have to work for that. And it will fall in place when it falls... (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:38:55
JOHN In place, you know? 

00:38:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:38:55
JOHN  Or else I'll die with a cigarette in my hand. 

00:39:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Do you enjoy smoking? 

00:39:00
JOHN  You know what, I don't anymore. 

00:39:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:39:05
JOHN You know, I really enjoyed not smoking. 

00:39:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:39:05
JOHN  Uhm, that year was the best year of my life. I really felt... (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:39:10
JOHN ...clean. My energy level was wonderful so I know that, you know, that. (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:39:15
JOHN You know. (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:39:15
JOHN  Uhm, it really was wonderful. It's just, I can't seem to grab, see, I'm go, trying to go back to where I was to do it again. And I can't ' coz I'm not there anymore. 

00:39:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:39:30
JOHN And this whole new life thing is like it's, you're right, it's a whole new life. 

00:39:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING It's a whole new life. 

00:39:30
JOHN And I don't understand it. Okay? 

00:39:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Uh hmm. 

00:39:35
JOHN You know, it's like. (crosstalk) 

00:39:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING What if you told yourself that every day? "It's a whole new life for me." 

00:39:40
JOHN Yeah, and just scrap all the other crap. 

00:39:45
[sil.] 

00:39:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING  I think you got a better ide... (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
JOHN Never like that idea. 

00:39:50

00:39:50
JOHN Well, but I, I think that's what you said. I mean, you know, just like, you just got, well, if you're gonna have a new life... (crosstalk)

00:40:20
JOHN ...of control in my life. 

00:40:20

00:40:20
JOHN  You know? But, you know, I can kind of, like, control the picture of what my life is from now on, you know? (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING That may be a good, a good thing to say every day, "Today, what can I control?"
