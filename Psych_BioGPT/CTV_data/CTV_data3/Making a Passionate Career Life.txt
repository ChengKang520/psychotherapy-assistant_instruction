BYRON WALLER  Thank you. In 160 the average employment tenure was 22 point five years. Today, the average tenure is three point six years. So there have been a big change between 1960 and now. Today’s worker before the age of 38 will have to change jobs between 10 and 14 times. Contact and part time workers have increased. Will have increased to about 40 to 60 percent of our labor market. So things are changing very quickly. A matter of fact, technology, technology, changes every two years. And we wonder why we have to get those cell phones every two years. Technology changes every two years. The world is a fast place, ever changing place. The world is changing very quickly. I was at a dinner party and I began to discuss retirement and what that would look like. And there was this gentleman who – who came up and he began to talk about his retirement. And he said, I have to work five more years. Just five more years and then I can begin living. I – I begin having a life. He even said that his health was really bad. But yet he had to continue living in order to have a life. But truth of that matter is, most of us do want to be in that position. We don’t want to have to wait to live. We want to live now as we work in our careers. We want to have meaning. We want to have purpose in what we do as we work for a level of success. But the question is, in an environment that’s ever changing, in an environment that is uncertain, in an environment that does not guarantee very much for each individual how is it possible to do that. How then can we help ourselves, and how can we help other people navigate their way through this ever changing work environment. Well today, I want to talk about three things that we can do in order to help people to become more successful in that search. Let’s start off by giving a quote what Steve Jobs said. He said, your time is limited. So don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma. Which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others opinion drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. Its time for us not to follow what other people say about our lives, about our careers. It’s important for us to take the initiative and begin to make decisions based upon what’s best for us. What our heart is saying to us, and what our intuition is saying to us. We must be willing to follow what our passions are. And what are passions. Passions is that thing that you will do even if you didn’t get paid for it. Passions is that strong uncontrollable feeling that motivates you to do something. It’s that deep down desire that you have and that you – it compels you to action. It compels you to do something. It’s deep down within. And it’s that passionate part of us. So how then can we allow for that passion, that’s part of us in order to help us in this ever changing world. Well the first thing that we can do, first thing is that we can create a space where we can explore our inner selves. We can explore our subjective selves. You see, in order to really identity where our passions are, we must first look inside of us. We must begin to know ourselves, know what drives us, what – know what we desire. And begin to listen to that small voice that we have inside of us. And then – so that we can interpret what that means. We must be willing to search both the rational and objective information that we get. But also to pay attention to that – that subjective experiences that we know. We must be willing to hear ourselves in a very different way. And we must be willing to explore ourselves in that very different way. Nelson Mandela said, there is no passion to be found playing small. And settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living. We have a life that we’re capable of living. And it becomes really important for us to allow for passion to live the life that we really want to live. Harry Tubman she said, that every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember you have within you the strength, the patience and the passion to reach for the stars, to change the world. We have these opportunities, we have this passion within us. But we must begin, first of all, by looking to see what’s there. And for long it can be very easy to remain and continue to do the old things that we do. And not begin to look for the new ways of how we can change our thinking, and change how we see the world. We must begin to create for ourselves a new narrative, a new story that will allow for our passions to have impact our lives. There are many career theorists who began to look at this concept in a very, very different way. We have HP Jalat and positive uncertainty. We have Stanley Crumbolts and happenstance theory. We have Mark Sevecka who looks at life design theory. We have Carol Vikio and her center point model. We have people who are beginning to say although this is the old way in which the careers used to operate, this is the new way. And the new way in which we can have a career that allows for us to live out our passions is beginning to hear our own narrative. It’s beginning to hear ourselves in a different way. And these theories are beginning to promote that idea. So that’s the first thing that we can do. We can begin to look inside of ourselves. The second thing that we can do in order to find our -- our passions and begin this passion search is that we can begin to learn how to follow our intuition. And I know when I say intuition many people I can see some eyebrows raise up, intuition. Yes, intuition. Intuition is one ability to understand something without the need for conscious reasoning. It’s, you know, it’s that ability where you know something without knowing why you know it. It’s that gut feeling that you have about something that you really didn’t research. It’s your instincts. And that was a very, very important part of human kind. I mean if we look back in our history, we can see how for our survival we were required to pay attention to our intuition. There are times in which we knew that we had to go to the water in order to get water. Because we shared it with animals who might eat us. But we had to listen to our intuition when it came to when to go and when not to go. And we relied on that. It was an ability that we had. And it was innate. However, when we began to become more rational we sort of left that behind. And we don’t really trust or even pay attention to this intuitive part of us. But some of us do. Like Albert Einstein. He said, that the intuitive mind is a sacred gift. And the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift. We have forgotten the gift of intuition. And how scientists like Albert Einstein relied on this intuitive part that is really important for us. He also said, I believe in intuition and inspiration. At times I feel certain and I’m right while not knowing the reason. He relied on his intuition. And we know that Albert Einstein was one of the most brilliant scientists that ever lived. So we must begin to follow our intuition. And then how can we do that. Let me give you just a couple suggestions. One thing that we can do I – I, uh, have followed – I got this – a lot of this information from my – from my research partners of Carol Vikio, and she said four things we can do in order to follow our intuition. One, we can become more aware of our intuition. Awareness. Because for most of us we don’t really – we don’t really pay attention to it. The second thing that we can do, we can name it. When we get that feeling that instinct, we can name it, that is intuition. We can strengthen it. And the only way that we can strengthen it is by using it. And number four, we can get committed to it. Now when we feel this intuitive part of us, is telling us to do something, we name it. We strengthen it and we commit ourselves to do it. Now, I know many of you are saying then how then do I determine when I do it and when I not. Well, we can pay attention to two things. One we can pay attention to the energy. When there’s time for us to do something and we want to follow that intuitive part of us, our energy is up. And we’re able to do it. But then there are times in which we have – might have an intuitive gut feeling about something and we feel some resistance. The resistance is telling us not to do it. So we have to pay attention to the energy, and pay attention to the resistance as we learn how to follow our intuition. In fact, Oprah Winfrey said this, she said, learning to trust your instinct, use your – using your intuitive sense of what’s best for you, is paramount for any lasting success. I’ve trusted this still small voice of intuition my entire life. And the only time I’ve made a mistake is when I didn’t listen. She pays attention to her intuitive voice. And she even says, for all the major moves in my life this is how I’ve done it. I’ve trusted my instincts. I’ve taken all of the information I can gather. I listen to the proposals, the ideas and advice then I go with my gut. What my heart feels most strongly. And for us it’s the same thing. It’s important for us, again, to take in as much information as we can. But then we must make a decision based upon what we feel our gut or this intuitive part is saying to us. So we must follow this intuition. The third thing we can do, we must become willing to try new things. And not stay in the same old ways. Stanley Crumbolt in his happenstance theory talked about five things that we can do in order to try these news things and allowing for this intuition uh, part. And to – to allow for us to search for our passions. The first thing we can do is be curious. And to be curious means that we’re going to search for these learning opportunities. And more than searching, we’re going to create them so that we can be curious and see what’s really out there. The second thing that we can do is that we can persistence. We can deal with the obstacles. Because we know once we get out there looking for opportunities, there will – will be some obstacles. But we allow again, for our passions to – to – that will compel us. And we continue on. The third thing we need to do, is to be flexible. We adjust all the situations that we’re in. We – we’re constantly optimistic and moving forward. And finally, we must be willing to take risk. Because in taking those risks, we will find the path that best allows for our passions and our intuitions to follow us. The last thing I want to talk you about is then how – if we’re going to follow our passions, begin this search and this intuition and try new things, some ideas that I think is important to leave you with. It’s from a person, Harrison Owens and he talks about the idea of open spaces. And this would allows us to move forward. Open spaces. And this is what they say. Whoever comes is the right person. Whatever happens is the only thing that could happen. Whenever it starts is the right time. When it’s over, it’s over. Then he has a law. And it’s the law of two feet. If at any time you find yourself in any situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet. And move to someplace more to your liking. And I’m going to encourage you to use your two feet by following your passion. Listening to your intuition. And doing new things. Thank you.

00:15:30
SHANNON DERMER Dr. Waller thank you. You’re very passionate about your career passion. Um, what got you interested in speaking about this subject? 

00:15:40
BYRON WALLER Well because I noticed how, um, the world is changing. And, uh, I – I tend to – I attend the National Career Development Association. And we get a chance to talk about careers in a long – in a – in a long term way, rather than what’s going on on present. So about seven years ago, I began to do research regarding how the environment is changing. And I happened to connect with a couple of other people who were on the same page as I. And we began to look at this idea of passion. Uh, one of my friends happened to be really connected to this idea of passion search. So for us, we continued to – to do the research and present on the idea of passion. 

00:16:20
SHANNON DERMER Great. Do you think that, um, you, uh, you quoted some statistics now that people change jobs about every three to four years. 

00:16:25
BYRON WALLER Yes. 

00:16:25
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:16:25
SHANNON DERMER Do you think that is a friend or foe to keeping your passion. The fact that people are moving jobs like that. 

00:16:35
BYRON WALLER Well, I – I would because it depends on your perspective. And how I tend to see it as this, we now have new types of careers now that we have boundary list careers. Where we no longer have – have to go home. In which we at home and we can work, you know. And then we have what they call protein careers. Where you can actually have the career that you want. You can work the number of hours you want and you can work in different places you want. How – how many of us now can actually live in another city and actually work somewhere else. It provides us with opportunity. Especially if we see it as opportunity. We can actually shape the type of career. You no longer have to do only one thing. We can do several things. And actually mold it to the lifestyle that we want. So it provides us with an opportunity. And it’s really is for those who willing to put themselves in that position and take advantage of that. So I see it pretty positively. 

00:17:30
SHANNON DERMER Okay. Um, now besides sleeping, basically, where we spend our most time is typically at work. 

00:17:40
BYRON WALLER Yes. 

00:17:40
SHANNON DERMER Um, and so a lot of our relationships I think occur at work. So how do you see this a boundary – boundary-less jobs where you can be more at home or moving every few years. How does that effect your ability to make relationships in your career. 

00:17:55
Byron Waller, Ph.D. 

00:17:55
BYRON WALLER  Well now, again, we have technology that’s very, very different. So many people continue to – to stay connected even when they’re not in the same location. So therefore, now we have social media, we – now we have email. We have other ways to – in order to stay connected. And those people who are most successful are those who are able to maintain those types of connections. And – and that also talks about the changing nature of career. The same – changing nature of those who may be stuck in the old way of – of being, has to -- 

00:18:30
SHANNON DERMER Did you just call me old. 

00:18:30
BYRON WALLER No I -- 

00:18:35
SHANNON DERMER So those stuck in the old way of being. You said you had to change your mind set. 

00:18:35
BYRON WALLER Yes. We have to be more innovative. You have to innovate. We have to look and see how it would benefit us. For those who are, uh, innovative and willing to change are the ones who continue to progress and find the level of success that they want. 

00:18:50
SHANNON DERMER Okay. I had a question here that – um, what do you think holds people back the most from finding their passion in a career. 

00:19:05
BYRON WALLER Will say fear. The truth is, most people want a certain amount of security. And they look for security and they say, if I stay in this one position then I don’t have to worry about change. I’ll stay here and it’ll be very comfortable for me. It will be very secure for me. But if we look at the market we see that things have changed. How many people can we identify who stayed in the particular position and they have been downsized. And then have been in – individuals who have not innovated, how have not stayed current on their training. And those are the individuals that we have to begin – those are individuals that we actually see in career counseling. For those who now have to make changes. But now, it’s become imperative that we’re always innovating, we’re always updating. And that has become part of our career process. Lifelong learners. This is part of the process for our careers right now. 

00:20:05
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:20:05
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. My, um, grandfather, who actually was very innovative, um, and he was a biochemist he – he would always say you’re never too, um – you’re never too smart, uh, to learn something new. You’re never too old or too smart to learn something new. And I think that actually is why he was pretty successful in his career. And it was his passion. He would consult all around the world. Um, so you’re saying even – even if you plan to stay in the same job for 10 years, it – you shouldn’t stop being – seeking out, uh, updating yourself and your skills and your knowledge. 

00:20:40
BYRON WALLER It’s necessary. We looked at the statistic it says that most people stay at a job for only three point six years now. So even if you wanted to stay in that position you’re not sure whether the position would be there for you. A matter of fact, most of the top careers that are out there are ones that have been recently created. Most of the careers in the future have not been created yet. So we have to continue to innovate and update in order to stay employable. 

00:21:10
SHANNON DERMER So it doesn’t matter what your plan is, you need to be prepared for the fact that your job may change and you might have to switch to a different job or even a different career. So you always need to be ready to be flexible and meet the needs of the, um – of the employment. Of the – the career opportunities. 

00:21:30
BYRON WALLER Yes. The job market is changing a lot. And it’s very difficult for the – for people to make those types of adjustments. But it’s necessary. Could you image now, we have young people who have to change jobs 10 to 14 times before they’re 38 years old. So in other words, this is going to be a part of the process. And for us who have been in the labor market for awhile, it may be – sound very, very difficult. But for younger people it will be part of the process. And they’ll be able to make those adjustments very easily. 

00:22:00
SHANNON DERMER Okay. Now I had asked you a question a little bit ago about, like, what – what, uh, gets in people’s way of, um, finding their career sometimes and you said fear. Um, I know someone who I was talking to, um, who wanted, you know, a career but every job that we discuss it’s like, well, but, well but, you know. Well but that doesn’t pay enough. Or well but that doesn’t really match my passion. Well but, you know, this or that. And there’s – there’s part of me that goes, yeah, but you just need a job. You know, or no job or no career is perfect. I love my job. Uh, I love my career. Um, but it’s not perfect. So talk to me a little bit about that. Why people get stuck. They want the perfect career, the perfect job. But I think people who have a passion for their career wouldn’t say, it’s perfect. But how – how can they can make it work. 

00:22:50
Byron Waller, Ph.D. 

00:22:50
BYRON WALLER Well, I think you hit it really, uh, an important point. Is that even in our career that we have passion, there will be a part of it that we may not like very much. But we still know that we have to be responsible and do it anyway. And clearly there’s a difference even in your question between a job and a career. You know, of course a job is something you do in order to make money. To make ends meet. That’s what you do. A career is something you build over time. So the decisions that you make are based upon which direction you want to move. So therefore you thinking, what skill do I have to add. What license do I have to get. What type of certificate do I have to – I need in order to move in the direction that I want to move. Now, we must manage our own careers. Rather than allow for someone to tell us what we need to do. We need to be more, uh – um, involved in making those types of decisions. And so most people are in that position of where I can have a career. But I can create it in the way that I want it. I only want to work you know, 30 hours a week. Then how do I create that. I may be unable to do it right now. But over time, how do I move in that direction that I want. And so – and that’s really what we’re talking about here. We are now in a context where individuals can make decisions about how they would like their lifestyle to be. And not wait until they’re retired to get it. 

00:24:20
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:24:20
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So – I mean, you know my background is really marriage and family therapy. And I teach couples counseling and things like that. So I like to make a lot of analogies to relationships. So, kind of when you’re at job it’s kind of like when you’re dating. But when you really commit to someone you have a really good relationship, that’s like your – your passionate career. And I think there are some things that, um, no relationship is perfect. But if you have a passion for it you, kind of, uh, don’t give a lot of weight to the negative things. And you get very excited about the positive things. 

00:24:50
BYRON WALLER Yes. And you can develop it over time. Because in your relationship with people, you know over time, it can get deeper and deeper and deeper. Because you’re now making decisions that will make that relationship better. And that’s how we can manage our own careers too. 

00:25:05
SHANNON DERMER So let me ask you then, because you do a, um, presentation – and I know part of your expertise is in financial infidelity. 

00:25:15
BYRON WALLER Yes. 

00:25:15
SHANNON DERMER In the relationships. Is there career infidelity then. If you’re always thinking about what can I do next and what can – how can I,uh, go to a different place and have a different experience. Do you think there’s career infidelity. 

00:25:25
Byron Waller, Ph.D. 

00:25:25
BYRON WALLER I would say, no. I would say really the truth is, that career is in your hands. There was a time when we had a social contract. Where a company will say, I’m going to take care of you. I’m going to make sure that you have retirement. I’m going to make sure that you have all those things that you need to have. But the contract, the social contract have been broken. So therefore, who’s responsible now. You are. So therefore you have to take responsibility for it. You have to manage it. Because if they’re not going to say – employers are not going to say, I’m going to take responsibility for you, then you have to take reasonability for yourself. And make those decisions that are best for you. 

00:26:05
SHANNON DERMER That’s a really good point. The social contract really has changed, hasn’t it. You know, yeah, there was a time where if you worked for a company for 25 years they gave you a good pension. They gave you a nice retirement party. They gave you – you know, all of these things. But that social contract is different. Not just on the part of the – the worker, the employee. But also on the part of corporations and employers. They don’t – there isn’t that kind of marriage and that long term relationship. Be – from the employer side also not just the employee side. 

00:26:40
BYRON WALLER And the – but that’s what makes it more, uh, into the hands of the individual. Who have to think about, okay, so what lifestyle do I want. How am I managing myself for retirement. How am I doing all those things necessary for me to get to where I really want to go. And so therefore, I need to take responsibility for that. I need to make decisions for that. And so, I’m responsible for it. So that over time, I can get to where I really want to be. 

00:27:00
SHANNON DERMER  So you – it sounded like when you were – I mean, because you quoted a lot of very inspirational – inspirational people. And, um, all of them, I would say definitely had a passion for their career. It sounds like you have a lot of, um, respect for that idea of passion. It sounds like you’re saying too that the most successful people are the people who have a passionate career. 

00:27:25
BYRON WALLER Yes. Because it can sustain their effort. They can not only have interest but they have passion for it. And then when things get difficult, they can continue on. Because it’s their passion for it that drives them, that compels them. And so, we can learn from them. They’ve had a certain level of success. And we’re not just talking about success for money. I’m talking success in having a life the lifestyle that they really want for themselves. So many can have the success and not be you know, as well known as Einstein or Oprah Winfrey or Steve Jobs. They can have a certain level of success in their own lives. 

00:28:00
SHANNON DERMER So that passion gives you a certain level of resilience. 

00:28:05
BYRON WALLER Yes. 

00:28:05
SHANNON DERMER And happiness whether you’re making a million dollars or famous or whether you’re making, you know, 20,000 dollars a year and you’re just famous in your own circle. That, uh, it sounds like you’re saying it gives you resilience and flexibility and – and happiness. 

00:28:20
BYRON WALLER Yes. And meaning and purpose. You can feel more purposeful what you’re doing. Because it’s what you’ve decided. You can even have meaning in what you do. Because it’s what you’ve decided. So we have opportunity. But the question is, are we going to follow it. And are we going to learn how to use it for the best way that we can. 

00:28:40
SHANNON DERMER All right. Good. So your passion gives you meaning in your career. And I hope you got a lot of meaning out of this presentation today. It was fascinating talk about passion and career. And how the landscape of career has changed. If you’d like to know more about this topic or other, uh, presentations by Dr. Waller or other experts in the counseling field, please make sure to check out the Alexander Street Press website. And I want to thank Dr. Waller for his passion on this topic. It was fascinating. Thank you.
