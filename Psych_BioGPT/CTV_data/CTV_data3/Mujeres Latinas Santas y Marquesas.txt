Mujeres Latinas: Santas y Marquesas Patricia Arredondo, Ed.D. 

00:00:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO  Good afternoon. I'm Patricia Arredondo, professor at Arizona State University. And my comments today are based on my Division 45 Presidential Address, " Mujeres Latinas: Santas y Marquesas." And what this represents is a reflection on the experiences, for myself, of growing up Latina, but some of the influences that historical icons and other cultural experiences have had on mujeres Latinas. The, ah, speech, itself, is dedicated to Maria Morales de Saldivar(ph), my abuela, or my grandmother, because in, in many ways in my own history, she becomes an icon as well, and has, she has served as a role model, as well as an icon. I'd like to quote, first of all, Gloria Anzaldua, a feminist Chicana writer from Texas, who has talked about the borderland experience. And this quote really speaks a lot to, what it is to be bicultural, to be bilingual and to live in this zone that is called, La Frontera, or the borderlands. Anzaldua talks about, "Living in a state of psychic unrest, in a borderland, is what makes poets write and artists create." In many respects, she captures some of the psychic phenomena, the psychic confusion of mujeres Latinas, and what it is to grow up as a mujer in what is called the borderlands or what, ah, Cordelia Candelaria calls, the "Wild Zone". In my talk today, I'm going to be framing several theoretical concepts and talking from three or four theoretical frameworks. The first is the multicultural and culture-specific competencies. But because what we talked about in, in psychology and in, ah, counseling psychology in particular, is to know how important culture is. The Surgeon General's report that was published in, ah, the year 2001, suggest that culture counts. And a culture counts with respects to understanding mental health. It counts with respect to educational development and training, as well as into personal development. So I'm gonna speak a little bit about the competencies. Also referencing to psycho-historical framework. Because this is the piece of all of us that we need to bring more to life. That is, how does history affect our psyche? How does history affect the kind of psychological processes we experience? Tenets of Mestizo psychology, Mestizo psychology puts more emphasis on what it means to be a Mexican- American. As a Mexican-American woman, this has been a fascination for me for many years. What is this indigenous part of myself and how does that affect who I am, ah, both consciously and unconsciously? Feminine psychology, and beginning in the '70s, there began to be more value on feminine psychology. What it means to be a woman? That women have a different identity development process than men, and that men don't have to be the norm. Well, beyond that feminist psychology is Latina feminist thinking. And that thinking, again, introduces the fact that this borderland, ah, this bicultural experience is one that needs to be, ah, counted on, taken into account, uhm, calculated into discussions about mental health. Let me talk for a minute about the his, psycho-historical landscape. Ah, this comes primarily from the work of Erik Erikson. And as many of us know, Erikson talked about identity development as being a key tenet to all of our formation. Uhm, and Erikson, of course, was a product of his own work because, ah, he was for many years, trying to understand who he was as a German-Jew growing up in Europe and, uhm, adopted our, or had, a, a, of, of, not of, I think it was his mother, but I think he had a stepfather and so the Erikson name came in, which was Swedish. Ah, but Erikson really did formulate this model as, of, of identity development but again from his own very personal perspective, but it still has a lot of value. What I liked about the psycho-historical landscape that Erikson talks about is that it allows us to understand the interaction of both conscious and unconscious processes. Some of the images that come up, based on cultural learnings, what's been communicated through our families, that sometimes, we hear as children and then some, ah, somehow becomes more manifest as adults. Uhm, so I could think about, you know, some of the stories, my abuela in this case would talk about in terms of growing up in, in Mejico. And the kind of rural experience and think about how that influenced her and how she became a much more acculturated modern woman when she was in the United States, but she still hung on to, what I would say, the residue of the past in her contemporary thinking. So, a lot of the morals, a lot of the values, a lot of the way of life was still how she wanted to practice her life here in the United States. And how some of that residue affects our emotions. So what affects me? I remember the first time I went to Mexico, and, uhm, I was in a restaurant very, we went to all, all sorts of nice, fine restaurants, and I felt very moved by having people of other, ah, other Mexican people waiting on me and I, I, I don't get that same sentimentality as I used to, but there was something about that, uhm, seeing someone in a, I guess, in a situation that I could've been in. And, kinda identifying with it and yet knowing that wasn't my situation but feeling some simpatico for what I saw. So that kind of sentimentality or emotion comes through as well because they're, these people are part of you. Uhm, the psycho-historical landscape also provides meaning for what we call this, "individual and collective consciousness". And so, when you get together with other Latinos, for example, there's this collective consciousness that emerges because there's a sense of knowing each other even though you don't know each other. And I know it happens for a lot of my African-American friends and colleagues, and they'll see each other, out of context and there's a "hello," and, you know, an acknowledgement because there's that sense of a collective knowing consciousness, ah, that we can identify with one another. And finally, the psycho-historical landscape introduces contextual synergy because it allows us to look at socio-political, uhm, psycho-cultural forces that have affected our iden, our, our, our identity development, as well as our empowerment, our sense of empowerment or our sense of disempowerment. So, we have to look at the broader context and how it's affected Latinas as women. And more importantly, I'm talking about the Mexican-American experiences which leads me into my next comment about forces that shape the mestizo or mestiza worldview . Just as though, a, a quick way of, of defining it, uhm, mestizo represents the legacy of the intermarriage of the Europeans and the indigenous people. And again, in this case, we're looking at the, uhm, intermarriage of the people in what were Nuevo Mejico, as the Spaniards called it, the New World, and the European Conquistadores. And, I'll talk in a few minutes more about some of the historical icons and that gave birth to the mestizo identity, to the mestizo culture. But some of these forces, if we, if we stop to think about it for a minute, is that the Indian, Indians of that time, Los Indigenas, really had to survive in an environment in spite of many, many invasions. And these invasions, in fact, were ones that could've totally wiped them out and we would've had a turk, totally European experience or, you know, we survived and continued and, and, again, I'm here today because I'm a product of what has continued. So the survival of, of the Indians occurred because of cooperation, collaboration and the learning of new skills. So, they had to be adaptable. They had to be flexible in order to take on the, uhm, practices of the Europeans, some of the thinking. And this came out particularly in religion, ah, where we saw the mixture of the indigenous beliefs. Uhm, if you're in Arizona, you know, the, the Native American philosophy is very powerful and it very much is about a belief system of unity and harmony with the land and the people and the trees. And this is very much how Los Indios of Mejico were very much oriented to their environment, much more contextual. But they had to take on the European traditions of Catholicism. Ah, which had different practices and, and really pretty much condemned what were considered pagan practices of the Indians. So, in spite of that, there was a synthesis of the Native American and European religious practices. And, of course, throughout a number of centuries, there has been, ah, a history of, of revolutions against European domination. And this led to what, uhm, Manuel Ramirez and Jose Vasconcelos talked about as La Raza Cosmica, or the Cosmic Race. Ah, and that has a sense of, uhm, of affecting what we call a pluralistic identity for mestizos. So, this is some of the backdrop as I talk about now what are the historical icons of mujeres Latinas. And I'm going to begin that with three particular perspectives, as I talk about mujeres Latinas. First is this notion of mestizaje. And the mestizaje again talks about the borderland experience, ah, la frontera. And this "wild zone" thesis that comes again out of work of anthropologists, and was, ah, popularized, I, I, uhm, popularized probably not the best word, but in the writing of Chicana, uhm, scholar, such as, Dr. Cordelia Cande, Candelaria, who talks about the "wild zone" thesis that Latinas have to live, and again, bridging the gap, ah, multiculturally , cross-culturally. The second, uhm, context that affects Latinas very strongly is that of la cultura, as we call it, and that la cultura embodies the family, the comunidad. Uhm, and then, the synergy and, and play, interplay between what is still traditional hierarchy of masculine domination, uhm, and yet feminist energy. Because there is a lot of feminist energy as you'll see through the literature, through the icons that I'm going to be talking about. And the third context that we've taken to account in understanding la mujer Latina are the fuerzas dominantes of history of these social systems, of political systems, and, of course, of religion, and how that all has affected the psyche and the development and the sense of empowerment of Latina women. The three figures I'm going to be talking about as examples of liderazgo, ejemplos historicos de liderazgo are La Malinche or Doña Marina, who's considered the mother, la madre de la raza cosmica/mestiza, La Virgen de Guadalupe, and Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz. And I will speak about all three of them briefly. Ah, La Malinche is a very interesting story. This is a woman who was an Indian woman, who was bartered by her mother, ah, as a young woman when her father died because her mother wanted her dowry so she could take care of her son when she married him. Ah, so she bartered here daughter to another Indian tribe. And this is what the story, the history, as it is written says. And so, she ended up moving away from her homeland in Southern Mexico and began to live among other tribes of, of Indians, and therefore, learned other languages, because the Spanish language again was introduced by los conquistadores. Uhm, the Indian tribes, particularly, the Aztecs spoke what we call Nahuatl. So there were a number of other dialects of Nahuatl as well. So, she learned all of those languages, learned to live among these people. So, she really developed a sense of pluralism as an individual. And that enriched her, and enriched her experiences. So, as she, ah, came, ah, into her own, there are multiple stories about La Malinche and how she became, uhm, part of the court of Hernan Cortes. Uhm, this particular slide depicts, depicts her and other Indian women being in a way given to Cortes and other conquistadores. That's one of the stories, and this is, a, a bit of, ah, as they say, ah, almost a fantasy, ah, image of, of how that happened. Another story is that the, ah, Indian Chief at that time, Montezuma, had her in his court because he, ah, she's somehow have come into his court because she was a valuable person, a very intelligent woman, and she was already working in the court of Montezuma. And because of her ability to learn languages, and because of her, again, intelligence, she became part of a, she became like a cultural broker with Cortes. And we also keep in mind that the Aztecs at first really viewed the Europeans as gods. So they, uhm, trusted them, and they entrusted, ah, Cortes. So, they gave away their power in a sense by doing that. But, ah, one of the stories goes that La Malinche was given to Cortes, ah, as a gift. But she became then his, if you would, uhm, became his property. Ah, and that's how things worked in those days. But she also became his cultural broker. So, I think we have one of the slides here, uhm, that shows, ah, La Malinche. Again, another, uhm, fantasy, ah, type image of, ah, La, of La Malinche in a little boat with Hernan Cortes, and she's holding up a book, and somehow, either reading or transmitting some information to him. And I think what this suggest is again the fact that this was a wise young woman, ah, but that she was a person who commanded the attention of, of two men who were very powerful, ah, Montezuma and Hernan Cortes. So be, she became this cultural broker and, uhm, what is, is, well, history again talks about the fact that because of the, her information to Cortes, she was able to help them, uhm, has(ph) elude, ah, a revolt by, ah, some of the Indian tribes. And this is the depiction of one of the battles, uhm, of, uhm, Chololla(ph). And here again, we see La Malinche informing Cortes on this kind of animated horse, and that they were then putting down the Indians. So, this is one of the stories about how she, in fact, ah, became this influence and this power. Uhm, and I think the other, the, the other part of the story is, of course, that, uhm, in that, as a woman, a, a, a, an Indian woman, she had to, to walk a very tight rope. She had to really be in the zone ah, of two cultures. A lot of people think she betrayed the Indian people because she was in the company of Cortes, but, ah, the other part of the history also says the Indian tribes of those days were also fighting among themselves. So, you know, to put the blame on her for the demise of, of the Aztec Empire is probably a little bit farfetched. But that's, you know, one, one account of history. And this particular, ah, slide here, it comes from, ah, a book that talks about La Malinche, and it's, uhm, the title of it is, ah, " Undoing the Myth of La Malinche: El Derrumbe De Un Mito." Because again, there're a lot of myths that talk about her as being the downfall of the Az, of the Aztec, ah, ampa, Empire, ah, were, in fact, you know, she was a woman who was in a way playing out her role, a subordinate role, which a lot of Mejicanas have had to do as well because the tradition of a hierarchy suggests that. But La Malinche again is called the mother or la madre de la raza cosmica, la raza mestiza because she gave birth to the son of Hernan Cortes, ah, who was named Martin after his father. And they renamed her. They baptized her, of course, because she was with Cortes. And she became known as Doña Marina. So, from there flow a number of, num, number of stories, and, uhm, she has become an icon for, ah, Mexicans, for feminist writers of Mexican-American heritage. And the context of talking about mujeres Latinas, particularly, Mexican Americans, ah, La Malinche is an icon we need to look at. The second, ah, image or icon I'd like to talk about is La Virgen de Guadalupe. Now, to Latinos, ah, perhaps, Mexicans more, in particular, La Virgen of Guadalupe is the patron saint of Mexico. But she's also the patron saint of North America. And the story goes that the, uhm, Virgin appeared outside of Mexico City, ah, in a church to an Indian, a poor Indian, who worked for the, ah, parish priest, la, in the, in la parroquia, the parish. Hence, what was the miracle about this apparition was that it was in December, and that, ah, the priest did not believe that this Juan Diego had seen La Virgen de Guadalupe. You know, after all, he was an Indian man and what did, you know, what did he know. And again, it, it was that kind of hierarchy and power. Uhm, so, he want a proof that Juan had seen La Virgen, so Juan came in to the rectory, and opened his cloak, and out of the cloak fell all of these roses, and that gave proof to the miracle because it was December and, and flowers were not blooming, roses were not blooming in December. One of the important, uhm, there are lot of important, uhm, facts about La Virgen de Guadalupe, because she is the Virgen that really am, amplifies, or exemplifies, the mestiza. She's a dark virgin. Ah, she always, al, also you see her in her robes, and these are the terracotta and turquoise robe, which again, ironically are southwest colors, or maybe not ironically are southwest colors. And, uhm, she never changes in her ima, this is the classic image of La Virgen de Guadalupe, ah, with her hands folded looking very pious, ah, looking to one side. And with this mantilla type, uhm, robe over her head, ah, which again is very symbolic of las, uhm, mujeres in Méjico, who, mujeres Latinas, putting on this, this kinda shawl, or rebozo, but hers is a long robe. Ah, and, and, in the story, again, the Virgen talks about how she's going to protect individuals. Ah, "I am your mother, and do not grieve or be disturbed by anything," supposedly the words of Our Lady to Juan Diego. So, she is considered the protectress who fights evil, and you can see the way she's, ah, standing there, the horns of the devil put on the arms of the angel. So there's a, a counterpoint here going on with La Virgen de Guadalupe. And more importantly because La Virgen symbolizes, is a woman, uhm, in the Catholic faith, uhm, and in the Latino culture, uhm, women are really esteemed as mothers, as protectress of children, as nurturers of children. So this particular images of La Virgen with Los Niños, con Los Niños, and they're praying to her. I also find this, ah, a very interesting image because of the children are very Anglo looking. And, ah, so I don't, ah, I'm a little confused by that, but anyway, ah, since she is the patroness too, of, of North America. And this one actually, she's a little whiter than some of the other ones. Ah, however, La Virgen still is considered the patroness of North America, of Méjico. And in battle, it is said that, uhm, the soldiers carried the banner of La Virgen de Guadalupe, ah, in one of the, uhm, wars, I think it was the war when, ah, when Méjico got its freedom from Spain, ah, the priest, ah, Padre Hidalgo, ah, carried the banner of La Virgen de Guadalupe into, into the war, ah, and that some of the other revolutionaries, later on, Zapata, also carried the image of the Virgin Mary. So, she has been, ah, considered the protectress, and also, this icon, not just for, for women, but for men. Ah, and there's a national celebration each year, a, a novena, nine days novena, to La Virgen de Guadalupe. And, again, it's not just in Méjico, it happens in the United States for, for families, for individuals, who wanna continue the practice, and pray for indulgences, and, ah, protection. The third icon I'd like to speak about is another figure from history called Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, a very, very fascinating woman, and a fascinating story about Sor, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz. Ah, she was born in the 16th century in Méjico, and was of a woman of, ah, privileged title background. However, even in those days, woman of privilege did not have the opportunity to go on to study at the university. And one of the stories that is said is that, uhm, Sor Juana told her parents when she ol, she was dre, about seven-years-old, and she came down to see(ph) her parents and she was dressed as a boy. And she told them, I wanna go study at the university. And she dressed as a boy because she knew that was the only way she could go. Uhm, well, they understood that, ah, this was important to her, so they sent her to live with some relatives in, uhm, Mexico City, and there, she began to be tutored privately. Uhm, and it said that she wrote some of her first poetry, ah, when she was about 11 years old. So she's a poet. Ah, she's a literary scholar, uhm, she's just so into dramas, a lot of theater works at that time. But she also realized that her way of becoming a scholar, ah, was by becoming a nun. And in those days, ah, if you had some privilege, becoming a nun was the best way to do it. Uhm, so she became a nun at age 19, and this again is one of the classic pictures of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz in her library, ah, surrounded by all her tomes, all her contributions to the literature. And it is said that people, when they were, ah, royalty and important families, when they were getting married, when they were having a particular celebration, would ask her to write something special for them. So they would have that as well, uhm, her contributions, and, and in return, she received many gifts from these families, ah, which was as a nun, she was able to have what we might look at as, as luxuries. Musical instruments, uhm, mathematical instruments, she was also known for her, ah, attunement to math. So she had all of these, in a way, all of these material acquisitions. However, uhm, Sor Juana was also, ah, had a calling, and, uhm, she was also interested in social justice issues and issues of the people. So when a famine hit in Méjico, a lar, large devastation hits, ah, it is said that she sold all of her instruments, and her, her books and her tomes, and used that money to help the, ah, the folks who really were poverty stricken and, and, ah, ill. And so she was able to buy healthcare products, remedies, and, and really engage other folks in helping those who were less, ah, privileged and had less economic means. One of the other statements that is made about Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, in terms of her feminist orientation, is that in fact, she was a strong feminist. And, there's, a, a book that she wrote in the, again, in the, ah, 16th century that's, uhm, talked about, is almost a magna carta for the time of woman's emancipation . And that she was able to speak very, very strong words about, ah, how women needed to be emancipated, how woman needed to have their own voice, and their own place in, in, in the world, and this is coming from, ah, a nun. So, in many respects, she was out of her league, but in many respects, because of what she wrote, and because of the way she was able to, ah, I guess infiltrate the system through her literature, she is considered an icon by both women and men of, a, of Latino heritage. Now, from these common number of themes and experiences, as we talk about mujeres Latinas, what we hear in the story of, of, of the icons, and in the story of many other Latinas, is the history of colonization. And that all Latinas, all meztizas, Méjicanas, our, our products, our legacy is colonization. At the same time, from models such as La Malinche, and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, we have this notion of emancipation and empowerment, ah, that we, we use our intelligence, that we use our skills, our flexibility, ah, to do, on behalf of others, to be these culture brokers. With the, uhm, the image of, of La Virgen de Guadalupe, we have, ah, examples of holiness and sacredness, as well as that self-containment that a lot of Latinas were talked, that you, you know, you have to be modest. You can't really talk about yourself. So you have to be, you can be your own person, but you have to do it in a way that you don't show it off. So there's, ah, a real dichotomy and a real challenge if you, in fact, have to downplay who you are and your strengths and your, your own wisdom. A lot of the themes for mujeres Latinas are about perfection. And I think those are some of the, ah, again, messages that, ah, we grew up with as Latinas, that you have to be the very best woman, ah, and that best woman meant, you know, you really couldn't, ah, make too many mistakes, you had to be loyal to the family, ah, you had to share good example for the family. Ah, and so that's, a, a hard road to walk if, in fact, you're, you're trying to be, a, a teenager or a young adult. The other themes are about wisdom and compassion. And that Latina women, our icons, our historical icons, did demonstrate both wisdom and compassion. As a cultural broker, La Malinche obviously was a very, very wise woman. Ah, but she also had compassion, ah, because she had to be brokering among two different types, or three different types of people. Again, she was a multicultural broker. And we see that also through Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz. And then finally, we have this other message of beauty and modesty that all Latinas grow up with. So, if we look at some of the early messages, we can begin to understand how we've been socialized as Latinas, and how much religion also plays into this. Because the messages growing up Catholic, in particular again, I currently speak from my experience growing up Catholic, and you kinda say now where's, where is that religion and where is the culture? You know, because they, they do play very closely together in terms of what are the rules for, for mujeres Latinas? And what we have in contemporary literature is what we call this concept of Marianismo. And this concept of Marianismo is one that's become more popularize. We have the book of, ah, a book called " The Maria Paradox," that talks about the rules for mujeres Latinas. And the rules are pik, ah, this two, uhm, psychotherapists , ah, did, case studies based on the therapy work they were conducting. Ah, on some of the themes that mujeres Latinas talked about, what it meant to be a mujer Latina. And these were some of the rules that they came up with. There were 10 of them, but I just have a few here. As a woman, you're taught do not forsake, or do not forget, your place as a woman. That meant in the family, in the hierarchy, in many ways that's stay in your place. You know, don't speak up. You have to be subordinate. Do not forsake tradition. And I remember, uhm, speaking to a, a group of women in the spring. We were teaching a course, in Yuma, Arizona. And, we had a number of Mejicanas, Mexican-American women in there, and, and they were talking about the traditions, but also in terms of the practices and who had to do what in the family and how in spite of it being, you know, the year 2001, that in some of their families, the men were still doing certain traditional tasks, and the women were still waiting on the men who were very capable of getting up and doing it. But they were still maintaining that traditional role. Another rule is not to be single, self-supporting, or independent-minded. And you'll still hear that from young women today who are, ah, battling with the idea of going to college. Earlier, we had a, a conversation with women from another university who were giving voice to how they came into higher education, and sort of the challenges of wanting to move away from home, and in some cases their parents, and this is not that many years ago, maybe within the last five to 10 years saying you can't. You know, you have to go to community college, you can leave home. So, those are the challenges about being independent minded. Another one of the rules, and sometimes we all laugh at this, is do not forget that sex is for making babies, not for pleasure. Ah, so there's a lot of this, uhm, attitude in, in Latino culture and, and I think more on religion. It more it comes from the Catholic religion that there's a purpose for having sex, and it's, and it is for reproduction, for progeny. And finally one of the other rules or one of the other commandments is do not ask for help. And a lot of women talk about this whether they're Latinas or not, you know, about being self-sufficient, about really trying to, ah, manage on their own. I like this quote from, a, a book by Denise Chavez, and Denise Chavez is, a, a wonderful Mexican contemporary writer, ah, does a lot in, ah, what we call Spanglish, but if, if you're Latina, you read this and you she, she, you get some passages in Spanish as well. And she talks about the pain and glory of being una mujer Latina. And this deems some of the contradictions, La Pena y La Gloria/The Pain and The Glory. And, from her book sheet, ah, the quote comes that the Mejicano version of what a mother is, of what a madre is, and should be, is the following. You place her up on the altar where all Mejicanos place their mothers next to God. So this is a tall order. And it comes mostly from men and the culture, who really revere their mothers. And so what Denise Chavez is saying in this book is, and she was referring to the protagonist who was saying that the protagonist boyfriend had this image that his mother had to be placed up on the altar next to God, which means you can't make too many mistakes, if you are up there next to God. So, this is some of the backdrop as we kinda look at some of the rules and some of the messages for mujeres Latinas, and looking at contemporary women today. And there are some contemporary examples of leadership among mujeres Latinas. Julia de Burgos is a Puerto Rican poet, writer, a, a great feminist as well, died in 1953. But one of her classic poems, I was my own road, I was my own path, "Yo Misma Fue Mi, Yo Misma Fui Mi Ruta." She talks about how she had to chart her own path. That there were rules about who she was going to be as a Puerto Rican woman, and that they were rules set up by the men. But she tried those and they didn't work for her, so she had to go her own way. So that's Julia de Burgos who's a very strong role model for many mujeres Latinas, especially Puerto Rican women. Dolores Huerta, who alongside of Cesar Chavez, led the migrant farmer, ah, movement. And, the, again, the rights for migrant farm workers and Dolores Huerta is still alive and, and she talks in her autobiography, "I would have meant to grow up as a, a woman with a mind," and the challenges she faced as a mujer Mejicano with a mind. Ah, nevertheless, she chartered her way into the mainstream, ah, albeit through the root of the migrant farm worker movement. And then Antonia Pantoja, another Puerto Rican woman who established an organization in New York that was designed to help Puerto Rican education and children called ASPIRA. And ASPIRA means to aspire. So, all of these three women again probably took pathways that the culture and the times were really, I guess counter indicating. These women all really began their work prior to the women's movement in the '70s. So, they were pioneers, and they are all mujeres Latinas. But there are other images of Latinas that I wanna briefly comment on, and these are women who are more into contemporary, uhm, I guess venue if we would call it that. Ah, some of them are what we look at as cross over artists. I remember in preparing this presentation on the web page, they on, uhm, AOL. They talked about Latina Lovelies, and you were able to cast your vote who, for the Latina Lovely. This is of course the year 2001, so they had up there, Jennifer Lopez, Selena, not Selena, uhm, Jennifer Lopez, Penelope Cruz, and some of those other women who have Latina last names. Christina Aguilar, and, I thought it was rather amusing, because there are more Latinas, it's okay to be Latina today, and a lot of these women are claiming that part of their identity. Uhm, but it was someone like re, Rita Moreno for example back in the 50's when the West Side Story was, was produced, uhm, and she did not have the major role of Maria who is a Puerto Rican girl in the story. Rita had one of the secondary roles, and it was Natalie Wood who played Maria, who is Puerto Rican. So, you know, that, that was how casting occurred in those times. You know, I remembered growing up and only seeing in the movies, images of women, uhm, Mejicanas or Latinas that were not positive ones. You know, women who were, either in, impoverished mothers, or women who worked in bars. So, you didn't have a real positive role model through the media. Some of the other, ah, crossover artists as we know are Gloria Estefan and her music, Nancy Lopez who became a famous golfer, Selena and, ah, Selena is a very interesting, uhm, figure because in her post her death, in fact she's gotten even greater fame, and greater recognition, ah, by the mainstream culture. Jennifer Lopez as we commented, and then Selma Hayek who's another, ah, contemporary, ah, movie star. And again, Selma right now is trying to, uhm, embody the role of Frida Kahlo through, ah, a movie that, ah, she's learned how to come across as Frida, and these are some of the other artists that, ah, I wanted to comment on because Frida Kahlo has probably taken on a bigger life also post death than any, uhm, than even Diego Rivera. She's really kinda come into her own. And we're gonna share a few icons of Frida, ah, Kahlo in a couple of minutes, ah, few, uhm, images or few pieces of her artwork. But again, Frida Kahlo is a contradictory woman also, of, of being part of two cultures even though her whole experience was in Mejico. Some of these other names are people who are writers, who are communicating this identity development process. I talked about Gloria Anzaldua at the beginning, the feminist writer who talks about "entre fronteras," between borderland experiences. Sandra Cisneros, who wrote the famous book, "The House on Mango Street," growing up, "Chicana Mejicana" and "Chicago" on Mango Street. And in, in that little story, that little book she, ah, has one of the entries about Esperanza. And Esperanza was a young woman who was questioning her identity. The word "esperanza" means "hope" in English. So, Esperanza was always wondering now, "Why was I given this name? Ah, is it because, ah, it was for my grandmother or, ah, is, is, is it mean that I need to hope more." And she was trying to get all sorts of meaning out of what it meant to be called Esperanza or "hope." " Thus, am I always gonna be hoping for something, waiting for something." Julia Alvarez is a Dominican writer. And Alvarez talked about when the, ah, Alvarez, no, when the girls lost their accent, and I'm forgetting about the storyline in terms of the real titer, title of the story. Ah, but she talked about four sisters who migrated to the United States with their parents, at the time of the revolution in the Dominican Re, Republic. And the experience of growing up biculturally with parents who wanted to maintain a lot of the traditions with their four daughters, and the challenge of coming into the country with an accent. And that was when the Garcia girls lost their accent. And how they lost their accent. And what it meant when they started dating Anglo boys. And so, you know, the accent became the metaphor for being bicultural, and also for that identity search. Denise Chavez, I've talked about in, in, ah, her books are "The Menu Girls," ah, "Loving Pedro Infante." And, ah, again, Denise Chavez talks about that experience primarily in New Mexico in the southwest. So, again, if you grow up here, you can relate to a lot, her, her stories. And then, finally, Esmeralda Santiago, whose famous book title says it all, "Growing Up Puerto Rican" and it's, ah, titled "When I was Puerto Rican". And, she talks about growing up Puerto Rican in New York, lea, leaving the island of Puerto Rico, growing up in New York, and then moving to Boston, and, and what it meant to grow up Puerto Rican in this very famous book, "When I was Puerto Rican." In a, in a way, the themes of all of these, ah, writers is about this identity search, and that it's not a, a, once in your adolescent development process, that it's an ongoing process of understanding who you are. The composite of your psyche, both consciously and unconsciously, and all these messages that you've picked up from your family, from the environment about what's okay, and what's not okay about being a mujer Latina or Puerto Rican or Mexican-American. I think, again, it's captured through the work of Frida Kahlo. This is, ah, these are few depictions of Frida Kahlo's. This is her, her very famous self-portrait. This is one of, actually, the more beautiful pictures of Frida Kahlo, ah, that she portrays of herself. Many others are, are less, uhm, I guess, less beautiful. But this one really captures her in her simplicity and, and her beauty. And, again, the story about Frida Kahlo was that, as a young woman, she had a very serious accident, ah, and lived in, and most of her life, in a brace. And she took up art because when she was, uhm, in, in bed, and she couldn't move, she, she needed to do something. So, art became her, her voice. Art became her, her message. The second slide shows Frida, uhm, again, walking between her two cultures of the indigenous culture, in the background, we see the, some of the pyramids, images of the pyramids. In the foreground, too, we see some of those, ah, ruins, ah, ah, Mayan ruins here in the front. And then we have the modern technology in the background. We even see the United States flag there which represents the colonizer to her, because she was really much a woman who wanted to push back, and you see, she's turning the Mexican flag in her hand. So, she's looking at all of, she's portraying all of these cross-sections of, of history, of culture, of domination and, and yet she is, she emerges in all of these, looking quite pure, ah, and quite, ah, again, a woman who knows who she is, because she's carrying her Mexican flag with her. But she's, she's been able to crossover into a number of different sectors of society, politically, and socially. And, finally, as we look at, uhm, this other image of, of Frida, this is where she begins to, uhm, talk about herself in, into, through different, uhm, I guess, again, it's metaphors and images. And where she, she looks again that, like she's been attacked, and she portrays herself as a deer, and you have, on many ways, you can play on this, you know, the innocence of this woman. Ah, and at the same time, ah, we know that her, her artwork is very powerful. But it's how she combines, this women who might be lost in the woods and, and sort of, under attack and, uhm, a, a, again, a woman, a woman who, uhm, wanted to communicate in both voices. If we look at our, our own life stories, I think what we also see is that there are icons that are in our own experiences. And I'd like to talk a couple of minutes about a personal icon for me who was "mi abuela." And this is La Abuela Doña Maria, as we used to call our, as well, we didn't call her Doña Maria, we called her Mama, uhm, instead of Abuela, we call her Mama. Everybody called her that. Ah, but the, the neighbors, the people in that community always called her Doña Maria. And I'd like to talk about her as an icon for myself, uhm, because, in fact, there are many things I learned about her, based on how she lived her life that really spoke to these messages of emancipation, and empowerment, and charting your own path. Ah, my grandmother grew up in Wahaca, Mejico, which is the southern part, so she's very Indian. And she ran away from home when she was 13. And at the story that she told us, and again, there are all sorts of little stories that she told us over the years, uhm, was that her life was very much probably going to be like the life of "La Malinche," which is she was going to be indentured to her family, because she was the oldest daughter. And it was a tough life. Ah, they were poor. They were in the rural community. And, she realized that this was not the life she wanted at some point. And, you know, I wish, again, we had had more time to kinda sit down and do an oral history with her to really explore sort of the, the thinking that went through her, her mind at that time as to, ah, what she saw, and why she wanted to leave it. But she, she did tell us about her life, you know, washing clothes down by the river, of cooking over those hot coals and, uhm, really being a servant for the family. So, her, ah, an aunt and uncle decided they were going to leave Mejico because, you know, they need, they just needed a better life. So, she ran away with them. And she ran north with them, and she had a lot of great stories to tell about running into Pancho Villa on the way, and how they all had to kind of lay low because they didn't know what side to be on. And, and they knew they were running. Uhm, and even in those days, this was, oh, I guess, she was 19, before the turn of the century. Uhm, so, she, uhm, she, eventually went, they went, the, one of the routes they went, northwest of Kansas. And, uhm, she spent a little time in Kansas, met my grandfather there "mi abuelo," and then they migrated to Illinois, and they followed the industry line. They weren't, uhm, farm workers. They fo, followed the industry. So, they ended up in the Chicago area where my mother was born, and then, eventually migrated further east to Ohio, ah, Lorain, Ohio, outside of Cleveland. I think what's a, a, a great story about my abuela is that, you know, she was a very, ah, diligent madre, like all of the madres that we talked about in, in Mexican culture. Ah, she was there for her daughters, she was there for her husband. And her true emancipation came when my grandfather died. And he died in 1944, before I was born. And, ah, my grandfather was not a, you know, a real wonderful guy. He was a great guy. He was a literary person. He was a very cultured person. He would know Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz. He know, knew poetry, and music, he taught all of his daughters music. But he was also an alcoholic. And so, it was not, you know, they had a tough life with him, 'coz he was very unpredictable. So, he died young, and, uhm, when he died, my grandmother went to work at the steel mill. And she began to really develop herself and her independence. Ah, she never remarried, ah, she outlived him by 46 years which is rather remarkable too, as you can tell, you know, she wasn't really, ah, a person who is going to lay herself down, but what she did throughout that time was, ah, what I think, I look at is very feminist behavior, not only did she go to work and, and become her own breadwinner, but she was able to save her money and leverage that to buy her first home. And she was also smart enough to know that if you had a home and her daughters, were all gone and, and ah, married, ah, well, you know, how else can you have a another income, a second income? So, she took in boarders, and she had immigrant men who were coming to work at the steel mills, also living there and she would prepare their meals, and they would, you know, just rent a room from her. And I remember the first house that I knew of, ah, as a child and, she had, she rented the basement, so, there was a guy who would stay down the basement, and up in the second floor, she had three rooms and then somebody actually lived in the attic. So, you know, she really optimized her space and she, she prepared, she had their meals ready for them at the beginning of the day and at the end of the day. Meanwhile, she continued to work until she retired. I don't know how old she was when she retired, to be honest with you, but I remember as a child, uhm, she would, we worked, we lived about a block away from the steel mill, uhm, on 29th street, and the steel mill run all the way down 28th. So, it was really, we had a lot of the nice fall out from the steel mill. But she lived a little further down and we would see, I would see her in the winter walking to work especially when she work the early shift. We would be getting up to go to school early. And she would be walking down the street, carrying her lunch pail going to work. And it was sort of a, it was just, ah, ah, I think at the time, I would look at then and just kinda wonder, you know, this is my grandmother. She's working at the steel mill and, ah, I don't know, it just, ah, kinda confused me at the time. I don't, confuse is the right word. I admire her but I also felt sorry for her 'coz it just seem like such(ph) a, such a tough thing for your grandmother to be doing, which was going to work at the steel mill under heart conditions. But she did and she, she persisted, uhm, and this picture was taken in 19, ah, 88, a year before she died and ah, were sitting on the front porch, and she was ill at the time, so she was looking very frail already. Ah, but she was a woman who really came into her own, as I say, because she had a lot of courage, uhm, she had a lot of pride and she was very, very, very religious. She had a lot of faith in God. And that's something that you hear in storylines from a lot of Mujeres Latinas, is their faith. Uhm, and she was just, again, she knew her background she was a very humble woman. Una mujer humilde con orgullo, but with pride. You know, she'd really wanted all of us to know about that sense of pride as women and as Mexicanos. She was definitely determined and tenacious. I look at her as having this multiple, and you know, roles and identities of a steel worker, an entrepreneur, you know, a woman running her homes and a story teller, very intelligent, great emotional maturity, because she had to transcend illiteracy. And as I said, she had strong faith in God and La Virgen de Guadalupe. She always had her altar that she prayed to La Virgen with her candles, and she was a very self-empowered woman. So, what are the messages we come away with when we think about Mujeres Latinas Santas y Marquesas, which is the title? Well, we see that this be, between borders and living in the wild zone experience is, is continuing. But at the same time, women, mujeres Latinas are transmitters of La Cultura. We transmit the culture. Many of us are trail-blazers. And many who came before us are trail-blazers, cultural brokers, very regal and saintly, very self-contained, and yet we have this paradox of trying to manage hierarchical and patriarchal societies. We channel on behalf of others and we're also women of wisdom. So, what are some of the closing comments here, as we look at, uhm, what the challenge is for mueres Latinas? According to Gloria Anzaldua, " To live on the borderlands means knowing that the India, the Indian women in you betrayed for 500 years is no longer speaking to you, that Mexicanas can tell you rajetas, can tell you different versions of what it is to be a Mexicana, and that denying the Anglo inside of you is as bad as having denied the Indian or Black". So, she's telling us that we need to know who we are. We need to know the colonization experience. We need to know these different strands of reality that are part of who we are, the Anglo, the Indian, the Black and claim all of those. "To survive the Borderlands, you must live sin fronteras and be a crossroads." Thank you for, for being with us this afternoon. And I think what the suggestions for competencies tell us is that psychologist must have an understanding of cultural heritage and other biographical data in order to really begin to appreciate the professional identity, the professional persona of themselves and others. The competencies suggest that psychologists' understanding of others worldviews, be they peer, clients or students is essential. And finally, that the competencies tell us that we must appreciate the historical, political and societal forces that influence the experiences of psychologist and others. We are all part of this equation. Thank you very much for being part of this presentation with me today.
