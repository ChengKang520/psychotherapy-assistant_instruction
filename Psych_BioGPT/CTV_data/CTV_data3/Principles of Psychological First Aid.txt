RICHARD HILL The year is sometime in the first half of the last century. The place is somewhere in the developed world. The disaster is one that will be repeated many times over in the coming decades. Let's say it's a flood whose rising waters have not only cut a wide sway of devastation as homes, businesses, and communities are submerged but also cause death and widespread hopelessness as those effected scramble to higher ground, usually with no more than the clothes on their backs. You're a trained disaster relief helper, perhaps from the army or possibly a member of the region's civil disaster team. You know that your job is to work with a highly specified chain of command to make sure that people are rescued off rooftops and other last resort places to the relative safety of shelters. You're experienced at the logistics of handing out food, water, blankets... and once this is organized you know that you have done your job well. Now, let's fast forward to the current millennium. The place is now anywhere in the world. The disaster is the same except possibly more devastating in its scope. The communities it effects are just as traumatized but there is a difference. In the twenty first century there is common understanding among disaster experts and professionals that just because people are safely housed in evacuation centers with food, water, and a matt and some blankets it does not mean that your helping job is finished. In the current disaster scene you need to know more than rescue and supply logistics. All those continue to be crucial. In today's world there is a general understanding that the mental health of survivors will be vulnerable. So, now you must tend to that level of their wellbeing as well. You need to be trained in psychological first aid.

Core Actions of Psychological First Aid 

00:02:30
RICHARD HILL Hi. My name is Richard Hill. Over the next 30 minutes or so, I'll be talking about a relatively recent phenomenon in the disaster scene, psychological first aid. While this video lecture and the companion video, "Core Actions of Psychological First Aid" won't by themselves totally equip you to enter a disaster relief scene, they will introduce you to the core principles and actions of psychological first aid. Here in the first part, I'll be defining it, identifying its characteristics, and explaining why our modern world demands this level of assistance. After I explain the five principles of psychological first aid, we'll see who's at risk of traumatic reaction and who tends to survive better. You might wonder what the symptoms of post incident stress reaction are, so we'll look at those too. The second part will illustrate through a psychological first aider's experiences in the field, the eight actions that spring from the five principles. We'll examine the issues of readiness to enter the field and also look briefly at the five competency areas a psychological first aider needs to be able to display in the field. Psychological first aid may be one of the most difficult volunteer jobs you will ever do but it's heartfelt work so, put your volunteer cap on. Let's get stuck in.

Principles of Psychological First Aid 

00:04:10
Psychological First Aid is a means of providing psychosocial support to individuals and families immediately after a disaster, terrorist or traumatic event, or other emergency. 

00:04:10
It is common sense 

00:04:10
It meets basic standards 

00:04:10
It is community-based 

00:04:10
It is designed for field delivery 

00:04:15
RICHARD HILL So, in trying to get a handle of PFA, psychological first aid, the first question is what is it? Is it what I am calling psychological first aid the same thing that you were thinking of getting involved in? What are its characteristics? Why do we need it? Psychological first aid is a means of providing psychosocial support to individuals and families immediately after a disaster, terrorist, or traumatic event, or other emergency. It consists of a set of helping actions which are systematically undertaken in order to reduce initial post-traumatic stress and to support short and long-term adaptive functioning. Based on the principle of "do no harm" it's provided increasingly by members of the general population, although mental health professionals are almost always involved as well. PFA has four characteristics, now, first of all, it's common sense. Second, it meets basic standards, third, it's community based, and fourth it's designed for field delivery. So, you might be saying a practical, consistent with research approach which is inserted (ph) in the medical profession and can be practiced at shelters, schools, hospitals, or, where, wherever there are survivors and that sounds great. 

00:05:45
Why do we need Psychological First Aid? 

00:05:45
18% to 21% indicated "severe" to "very severe" impairment 

00:05:45
Prevention 

00:05:50
RICHARD HILL Still, why do we need psychological first aid? Well, here's my take on the "so what" question. Disasters, both natural and human made can strike at any time. Sometimes we get a warning, sometimes we do not. Uh, it's estimated that being involved in a significant traumatic event which causes post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, will mean a lifetime of that event continuing to be prevalent for about 61% of men and 51% of women. In a study of 60,000 disaster survivors between 18 and 21 percent indicated severe to very severe impairment. Disasters and emergencies are shocking events whose effects can stay with us for a long time, if not a lifetime and ever since PTSD has been recognized as a disorder in the late 1970s, experts have realized that the psychological wellbeing of survivors and disaster effected people needs to be tended to, as, as, well as the physical aspects. Most people are resilient enough, say mental health and disaster response experts, that if they're given psychosocial support right after a disruptive event, they will eventually go back to normal without additional specialized mental health intervention. So, psychological first aid is helpful as assistance that prevents more serious problems happening later on. 

00:07:15
The origins of PFA 

00:07:20
RICHARD HILL Aye, are you curious just to how psychological aid first started? Well let's look. The need for it was recognized as early as 1922 when the war offices in the United States sought to support its military personnel experiencing combat stress. Those sitting up for the programs for the, uh, soldiers, acknowledged the need for the same five elements which have grown into today's psychological first aid. That is they appreciated that the soldiers needed to be made safe, to be calmed, empowered, connected to loved ones, and instilled with hope. Nevertheless, the main criterion for success of these interventions was not relief of stress syndro-, uh, of, stress symptoms, not syndrome, I mean, certainly that's a syndrome that we have. Rather, it was whether the soldiers could be made functional again and especially whether they could return to active duty. Given that most disaster survivors whom you will be assisting were not on active combat duty when the disaster struck. Your goal in providing first aid would be to help them return to as normal a condition as possible as soon as possible. First look at the principles that will help them to do that.

Psychological First Aid: The Framework 

00:08:40
AIPC Lecture Series 

00:08:40
Principles of Psychological First Aid 

00:08:45
RICHARD HILL While most, uh, eh, experts writing about psychological first aid are at pains to say that there is not a wide basis of research findings from which to find consensus about the best type of support after a disaster. Most medical and disaster response experts consider the psychological first aid framework to contain the, quote, best intervention practices, unquote, based, as I said earlier, on the five principles. 

00:09:15
Principle #1: Promoting a sense of safety 

00:09:15
Restoring the 'protective shield' 

00:09:15
Reducing deeply embedded neurobiological reactions that come with fear and anxiety 

00:09:15
Correcting trauma-influenced views about the "dangerousness" of the world 

00:09:15
Safety in the social system, including safety from rumours and unbalanced information 

00:09:15
Safety challenges due to media presentation 

00:09:15
Principle #2: Promoting a sense of calm 

00:09:15
RICHARD HILL Principle number one is promoting a sense of safety. It seems self-evident that a number one goal in reducing trauma is to help a survivor or a disaster effected individual to relative safety and yet there are, several, several, angles to this issue. An important consideration is that of restoring the protective shield. Now this means dealing with both the objective reality of safety, that is the person's really out of danger, but also the person's felt sense that they are out of danger. That is the subjective experience of safety. Traumatic events threaten to disrupt the protective shield, that ongoing sense of having a safe life, that gives stability to life and underlies the development and maintenance of mental health. It's this that must be restored in first aid efforts. Another aspect of safety is that of reducing deeply embedded neurobiological reactions that come with fear and anxiety. The fight or flight reaction is profoundly hardwired into our human brains. It's an old survival response that is evoked with fear and anxiety. Reducing fear reduces the neurobiological reaction and may also reduce subsequent PTSD. A third consideration in restoring safety is that of correcting trauma-influenced views about the dangerousness of the world. Research has shown that holding a belief that the world is extremely dangerous is one of the main though patterns that increases the risk of developing PTSD. So, promoting safety in these cases means breaking the linkages survivors have made in their minds between harmless images, people, and things and dangerous stimuli associated with the original traumatic event. As a psychological first aider you also need to deal with safety in the social system, including safety from rumors and unbalanced information. Unfortunately, there is often little information at hand, especially as an event is unfolding, so the rumor mill runs rife with people sharing horror stories and survivors thus being re-exposed to trauma. The intervention required of leaders is to present accurate, balanced, and well organized information to increase the perception of safety. Now finally, you must be a tune to safety challenges due to media presentation. Similarly, the quieting of the rumor machine, psychological first aid is promoting safety, must attempt to prevent the spread of fear in a community that can be endangered through government issued and other messages delivered via the media. Messages must be well orchestrated to prevent the escalation of anxiety but unfortunately, uh, sometimes politicians, uh, prone to exaggerate situations for their own political ends. Well, you know, for instance the stance of, elect me and I'll protect you. These are the main issues concerning a sense of safety and really, these words just allow for a comfortable Segway into principle number two, which is about promoting a sense of calm. There are several interventions that promote a sense of calm among survivors and trauma effected people. Most of them involve some form of retraining to remind people that they're no longer in a danger zone and that their thoughts and feelings are not dangerous in the way that the original disaster was. Their stress reactions need to be normalized. That is, with, with, statements like, uh, uh, you are neither sick or crazy. You are having a normal reaction to an abnormal situation and they need to be able to see the problems engendered by the crisis. Often, seeing it's, you know, one big insoluble problem, you know, floods, hurricanes, all these things, but they can be broken down into manageable bits and solved. 

00:14:15
Therapeutic grounding 

00:14:15
Breathing retraining 

00:14:15
Deep muscle relaxation, yoga, and mindful meditation 

00:14:15
Stress inoculation training 

00:14:15
Normalisation 

00:14:15
Positive emotions 

00:14:15
Problem-focused coping 

00:14:15
Psycho-education techniques (as part of community outreach) 

00:14:15
Anxiety management for mass consumption (through the media and internet) 

00:14:15
Interventions to furnish needed resources 

00:14:15
RICHARD HILL Now, here's some of the techniques, and they include: Therapeutic grounding, breathing retraining, deep muscle relaxation, yoga, mindfulness meditation, stress inoculation training, normalization, positive emotion training, problem-focused coping, psycho-education techniques, this is as part of a community outreach, anxiety management for mass consumption through the media and the internet, interventions to furnish needed resources. 

00:14:55
Principle #3: Promoting a sense of self-efficacy 

00:14:55
Self efficacy 

00:14:55
Collective efficacy 

00:14:55
Survivors must be helped to avoid "spreading incompetency" 

00:14:55
RICHARD HILL Principle number three says that we must promote a sense of self-efficacy. That's a wonderful term developed by Albert Bandura. Probably no construct or component of recovery has received as much attention in psychology as the importance of having some sense of control over positive outcomes. So, the belief in individuals that they are empowered to help themselves, to sort out problems. It's a major factor in them and acting (ph) the behaviors to do so. This sense of being empowered has two important aspects, self-efficacy, where individuals that their actions are likely to lead to generally positive outcomes. They can do this through regulating their thoughts, their emotions, and their behavior, and there's collective efficacy, a sense that one belongs to a group that is likely to achieve positive outcomes. The achievement of efficacy has some interesting twists and turns, so, let's look at these as a way of understanding which interventions might work to promote this all important characteristic. Survivors must be helped to avoid spreading incompetency, lack of self-efficacy. Let's say you survive the horrible disaster, let's call it extreme flooding, uh, that I proposed at the start of the talk and you and your family are intact but with almost no possessions. All credit cards, plus other forms of identification were swept away in the floods. You, you, know that you will need these to reestablish your life. I mean, even to lease a place while decisions are being made about how to, replou-, replace, your house but you feel so overwhelmed by events that you can't think of what cards you had in what wallet. Goodness gracious, let, al-, let alone how to replace them. You assume that this is just a temporary situation brought on by the shock and you'll soon feel better, and, and, more able to complete these tasks. As the weeks go by, however, you come to the unfortunate realization that just the opposite is happening. You're experiencing a sense of "can't do it" in just about everything. Not only flood related tasks but in all areas of your life. This is happening, you're experiencing spreading incompetency. Moreover, you used to have pride in your little community and its "can do" attitude, but since the flood it seems that the whole community has gotten bogged down in endless red tape. Everyone's in the same boat as you so nothing seems to be happening. Going from your empowered former selves to this sadly shrunken individual in a community that you've become, uh, you see in the mirror and around you, now, now, is a discouraging experience. In short, you've lost your sense of both personal and collective efficacy and restoring it is hard, but this is one of the primary tasks of psychological first aid. These major points needs to be kept in mind in order to enhance survivor's damaged sense of empowerment and self-efficacy. 

00:18:35
1. Self-efficacy cannot occur in a vacuum; it must happen in collaboration with concerned parties when large-scale problems - beyond the reach of any single individual - are to be solved. 

00:18:35
2. The family must be strengthened to build efficacy in the community, as it is an important source of social capital, and also the main place from which traumatized survivors will initially draw support and mental health care. 

00:18:35
3. Self- and collective efficacy require the knowing of certain behaviours and skills. It is important to have a belief in one's capacity to solve problems, but if that is not backed up by some basic skills at problem-solving, the belief collapses fairly quickly. If there is reasonable evidence of potential risk, it is useful to practice situations that might come up to build skills before the disaster hits. 

00:18:35
4. Empowerment without resources is counterproductive. No matter how strong the self-belief of an individual or community, if there are not resources available to act with/on, people feel demoralised, and recover is delayed. 

00:18:40
RICHARD HILL For one, self-efficacy cannot occur in a vacuum. It must happen in collaboration with concerned parties when large-scale problems, beyond the reach of any single individual, are to be solved. Two, the family must be strengthened to build efficacy in the community as it is an important source of the social capital and also the main place from which traumatized survivors will initially draw support and mental health care. Three, self and collective efficacy require the knowing of certain behaviors and skills. It's important to have a belief in one's capacity to solve a problem but if this isn't backed up by some basic skills at problem solving, the belief can collapse fairly quickly. If there's reasonable evidence of potential risk, it's useful to practice situations that might come up to build skills even before the disaster hits. this can happen even in the short term when an impending disaster, as can happen with floods, can be known. Four, empowerment without resources is counterproductive. No matter how strong the self-belief of an individual or a community, if there are not resources available to act with or on, people, they feel demoralized and recover is delayed. 

00:20:05
Principle #4: Promoting connectedness 

00:20:05
Enhances opportunities to find out information essential to disaster response 

00:20:05
Provides opportunities for problem-solving, emotional understanding, and acceptance 

00:20:05
Increases sharing and processing of traumatic experiences 

00:20:05
Engenders mutual instruction about coping 

00:20:10
RICHARD HILL Principle number four is about promoting connectedness. An internet search of social support yields thousands of articles on the importance of social support for people in distress. This is because social support and social connectedness enhances opportunities to find out information essential to disaster response. It provides opportunities for problem-solving, emotional understanding, and acceptance. It increases sharing and processing of traumatic experiences and it helps to normalize reactions and experiences. It engenders mutual instruction about coping, and all of this can lead to the community efficacy that I've just been discussing. There's just one problem, there is very little empirical evidence on how to translate these, well, these, well, validated, principles into a psychological first aid intervention. So, providers of psychological first aid are called upon to get creative about how to enact this principle. It's important though, because here are some glitches that can happen if there was no social support or poor social support. 

00:21:30
Lack of connectedness breeds trauma reaction 

00:21:30
Not all support is created equal 

00:21:30
Support can deteriorate quickly 

00:21:30
Not all "support" is supportive 

00:21:35
RICHARD HILL One, more, (ph) really important one is of this lack of connectedness, it breeds trauma reaction. In the wake of the 9/11 attack, and, and, the collapse of the twin towers in New York and also following terrorist attacks in Israel, one of the most common coping responses was to identify and link with loved ones. When connections with loved ones were delayed because, the London bombings, you remember those, they were, there was increased incidents of subsequent trauma and research on disasters and terrorist attacks in countries as disparaging as the United States, Israel, Mexico, Palestine, Turkey, Bosnia, all show that social support is related to better emotional well-being and recovering following mass trauma. However, it's important to note that not all support is created equal. Support can deteriorate quickly. As with funerals there is often an outpouring of assistance, support, and comfort when a disaster effects a community. Survivor's psychological distress is mitigated by the, expresses, expressions, of concern and, the, the, helping that they receive. The reality for most social supporters however is that at some stage, they, well simply, they need to get on with their own lives and they cannot realistically continue to offer support at the same level. So, when the survivor may be still mired in grief and shock needs to receive continuing support, there's a mismatch where it requires further adjustment, on the, on the, part of the survivor to cope with the social support leaving. Not all support is supportive. This is a difficult one because sometimes so-called supporters, in fact, can undermine survivor's recovery through minimizing their problems and needs, holding unrealistic expectations about recovery, giving invalidated messages, blaming the effected person. This can be particularly detrimental to a person, uh, towards his efforts (ph) to come back to normal. I mean, obviously, it's crucial to identify early on who is receiving or likely to receive such support, or, or, who, such as socially isolated people may have poor support systems, but similarly it would be difficult to make, intervection, interventions, connecting people to support systems when the community that those systems were part of have been evacuated or destroyed in the disaster. Intervention in these cases should be a priority. 

00:24:15
Religious, ethnic, and tribal divisions become more salient when resources are scarce 

00:24:20
RICHARD HILL Religious, ethnic, and tribal divisions become more salient when resources are scarce. Disasters and terrorists even, don't just happen where the communities are perfect. They can occur in areas where long before the disaster there were schisms in the community according to their religious, their racial, ethnic, social, tribal lines. They're difficulties that occur between people. When we're in good times, uh, a sub, pop-, population in a community, uh, may be able to, tolera-, tolerate, another group but threats of violence, death, and the concomitant loss of resources from a disaster can result in groups becoming more, specis-, suspicious of one another and less tolerant. This means that just when extra social support is needed, less is available. 

00:25:10
Stevan Hobfoll, PhD, has authored and edited 11 books, including Traumatic Stress, The Ecology of Stress, and Stress Culture and Community 

00:25:10
Principle #5: Promoting Hope 

00:25:15
RICHARD HILL Stevan Hobfoll and his colleagues found that during a period of high terrorist activity, both Jews and Arabs became more xenophobic and as their PTSD increased especially. Overall, despite the research gap, experts agree that there is enough experiential evidence from the post 9/11 environment to declare that promoting connectedness after disaster and terrorist activity is a best practice intervention. The fifth principle of psychological first aid is that of promoting hope. There's really quite a lot of definition, uh, a controversy about, uh, what hope means, how we define it, but regardless of this, it's reasonable to think of hope as related to a person's sense that things will improve both within themselves and in what becomes available to them. On that, sort of, rather generalized basis, let's look at the importance of hope. There's a saying that in a mass disaster, hope is one of the first victims. Mass trauma is often accompanied by a sense of one's view of the world has been completely shattered and that the future has been shortened. There is a feeling that all is lost. Yet those who remain optimistic are likely to have better outcomes after experiencing mass trauma because they can maintain a reasonable hope for the future. So what can psychological first aiders do to promote hope? 

00:26:45
CBT and Positive Psychology 

00:26:45
Normalising 

00:26:45
Survivors retain hope better when we help them de-catastrophise 

00:26:50
RICHARD HILL One way is to use CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology. When some individuals experience loss they exaggerate their personal responsibility, believing wrongly that what happened, perhaps, was their fault. Therapies can help to create the most hope for those using things such as CBT to help people reduce such irrational beliefs. In addition, the learned optimism and positive psychology model attempts to identify strengths in people at risk and amplify them. In their strength building activity, positive psychologists concentrate on hope and show survivor clients how to dispute the catastrophic and exaggerated, linking, thinking, that would otherwise undermine hope. Another technique to install hope is that of normalizing. As with promoting calming, normalizing interventions help people to understand that their reactions are predictable normal responses to an abnormal situation, and often effective normalizing remark is to indicate to survivors and to disaster effected that most people recover on their own without additional mental health interventions. This in itself instills hope as the effected person can then counter-thought such as, "I'm inadequate" or "my reactions are a sign that I can't take it", similarly, survivors retain hope better when we help them de-catastrophize, an intervention component that is crucial to preserving and restoring hope. De-catastrophizing can help counter negative thought patterns. Many people catastrophize in order to prepare for the worst, uh, while doing this can have some adaptive, uh, sense in some cases, it, it, really more often leads to a failure to cope. The better option is to envision a realistic, challenging outcome. For instance, "it will take some time to rebuild my house but I can", rather than, "I'll never own a home again". 

00:29:05
Community-level interventions foster hope by building social-ecological resilience 

00:29:10
RICHARD HILL And finally community level interventions foster hope by building social-ecological resilience. An important determinative community's capacity for recovering from disaster is how well they can mobilize assets, networks, and social capital, both to prepare for coming disasters and to recover from those which have already, ca-, occurred. Different segments of the community which tend to have a leadership role, churches, schools, community centers, can be instrumental in helping people to set positive goal, build strengths, and also provide a place to tell their story. The grand advantage of community inspired initiatives is that they can implement hope building interventions such as community organized clean-ups, home visits, blood drives, that's always something that's necessary, and other needed initiatives that involve community members who would otherwise feel like the problem's too big for one person to tackle alone. So there we have it, a simple framework for action involving the promotion of safety, calm, empowerment, connectedness, hope. Yet not all survivors will react the same to these interventions. We need to ask who is at greatest risk for traumatic reaction?

00:30:35
Those with significant loss of possessions (for example, home, pets, family, memorabilia 

00:30:40
RICHARD HILL Often, psychological first aid field guides try to alert volunteers to the many factors and classes of individuals which carry a higher probability of mental problems after a disaster, commonly included on the factor lists are those that have been exposed longer or to greater magnitude disasters. Those who have been exposed first hand to extreme life threats or those that have repeated threatening experiences, those who have been in a high degree of personal danger and those who have been acquainted with victims who have died. Similarly, those who have mental health issues before hand, either personally or in their families, those who come from cultural backgrounds which respond poorly to adversity and perhaps even those who have had recent tragedies or disruption to their lives and communities. They're all at greater risk for traumatic reaction. Having to deal with media interference doesn't help much either. In addition to the above situation factors, there are individuals that are at special risk after, da-, disaster, and some of these include: children, especially those separated from parents and caregivers. Those who have been injured. Those who have multiple relocations and displacements, medically frail children and adults. Those with serious mental illness. Those with physical disabilities, illness, or sensory deficits, adolescents who may be risk takers, adolescents and adults with substance abuse problems, pregnant women, mothers with babies and small children, disaster response personnel, we must never forget them. Those with significant loss of possessions, for example, your home, pets, family, memorabilia. All these things are very important and very difficult and these are the ones that we want to particularly look out for post-disaster as they're less likely to come through with resilience, but let's turn to that question and ask, after the disaster, who survives better?

Principles of Psychological First Aid 

00:33:20
RICHARD HILL In recent years, many disaster response experts and mental health researchers have switched their focus from looking exclusively at the at-risk populations in the aftermath of an emergency to asking what are the protective factors? What situations, experiences, or, or, personal traits help people to come through a traumatic incident more resiliently? And here are some of the factors negatively correlated with PTSD and out of post-disaster mental disorders, they help protect against trauma response. 

00:34:00
If you have an optimistic outlook and positive expectations 

00:34:00
If you having coping skills gained from previous distressing events and experiences 

00:34:00
If you receive good social support from others 

00:34:00
If you possess emotional stability 

00:34:00
If you have been a disaster worker in environments that are less horror-filled and/or more rewarding 

00:34:00
If you have had relatively light loss of resources 

00:34:00
If you have been provided with basic resources (food, shelter, emotional support) early on 

00:34:00
If you have a strong moral belief system or spiritual holding 

00:34:00
If you are able to return to "normal" life (i.e., reduce disruption) relatively sooner and 

00:34:00
If you have a strong sense of cultural/racial identity 

00:34:05
RICHARD HILL If you have an optimistic outlook and positive expectations. If you have coping skills gained from a previous distressing event, and, or, experience. If you receive good social support from others. If you possess emotional stability. If you have been a disaster worker in environments that are less horror-filled and are more rewarding. If you've had relatively light loss of resources. If you've been provided with basic resources, food, shelter, emotion, res-, uh, and support early on. If you have a strong moral belief system or spiritual holding. If you're able to return to normal life with, uh, you know, there's a reduced disruption, you know, relatively sooner than others so there still are some things you can return to. If you have a strong sense of cultural, racial, identity. These things, very important and very helpful. Finally we want to know if someone does end up being traumatized, what does a post-incident stress reaction look like?

RICHARD HILL So looking for symptoms of trauma in the wake of a disaster is different from gauging client reactions in the calm confines of a therapy room. I mean, every emergency and traumatic experience is unique and so it's a myriad of reactions that survivors have, but the world health organization notes that if you see any of these stress reactions, this is of concern. 

00:35:55
1. Physical symptoms (for example, shaking, headaches, feeling very tired, loss of appetite, aches and pains) 

00:35:55
2. Crying, sadness, depressed mood, grief 

00:35:55
3. Anxiety, fear 

00:35:55
4. Being "on guard" or "jumpy" (hypervigilance) 

00:35:55
5. Worry that something really bad is going to happen 

00:35:55
6. Insomnia, nightmares 

00:35:55
7. Flashbacks or scenes from the disaster coming back intrusively to mind 

00:35:55
8. Irritability, anger 

00:35:55
9. Impulsiveness (especially for adolescents, who may take unwarranted risks) 

00:35:55
10. Guilt, shame (for example, for having survived, or for not helping or saving others) 

00:35:55
11. Confused, emotionally numb, or feeling unreal or in a daze 

00:35:55
12. Appearing withdrawn or very still (not moving) 

00:35:55
13. Not responding to others, not speaking at all, being "shut down" 

00:35:55
14. Disorientation (for example, not knowing their own name, where they are from, or what happened 

00:35:55
15. Not being able to care for themselves or their children (for example, not eating or drinking, not able to make simple decisions) 

00:35:55
RICHARD HILL Physical symptoms, for example, shaking, headaches, feeling very tired, loss of appetite, aches and pains. Crying, sadness, depressed mood, and grief. Showing anxiety and fear. Being on guard or jumpy, you might have heard the term hypervigilance, we'd describe for that. Worrying that something really bad is going to happen or that negative attitude to the future. Insomnia or nightmares. Flashbacks or scene from the disaster coming back intrusively to mind to, you know, these early PTSD symptoms. Irritability and anger. Impulsiveness, especially you see this in adolescents who may take unwarranted risks or have unwanted, sort of, uh, ways to change things. Guilt or shame, for example, having survived, uh, and for not having helped save others. Confused, emotionally numb, or feeling unreal in, sort of, a daze. Appearing withdrawn, being very still. Not responding to others, not speaking at all, being very shut down, and disorientation, for example, not knowing their name, where they're from, what happened, what the date is, what time frame you're in. Not being able to care for themselves or their children, for example, not eating or drinking and not being able to make simple decisions in self-care. I want to note, it's vital to make sure that severely distressed people are not left alone. It may be up to you as the psychological first aider to try to keep them safe until the reaction passes or until you can find help from health personnel, local leaders, uh, other community members in the area.

"Core Actions of Psychological First Aid" 

00:38:00
RICHARD HILL Over the last half hour or so I've been talking about a crucial component of modern disaster recovery, psychological first aid, for survivors and trauma exposed people. I, I've defined it. I've talked about why we need it. We've looked fairly extensively at the five principles, uh, promoting safety, calmness, self-efficacy, connectedness, and hope, which are the foundations of psychological first aid no matter the particular circumstances in which it's delivered. I identified the factors in the groups which are at great risk and the factors which tend to help people survive better. Of course, it's imperative for you if you will be volunteering in a disaster scene, to recognize the symptoms of stress reaction, so I named the chief ones that you might see. In the next psychological first aid video we talk about looking at the eight actions which spring from these core principles and also discuss five areas in which you should have competency if you are thinking of entering the field. In the same vein, we assess how ready you might be to do field work. Stay with us, there's a lot to know, yeah, sure, but if you take these concepts on board, the positive impact you ma have is immeasurable.
