00:00:20
MARIANNE I am quite unnerved about following my dear colleagues in introducing people. I think the best – I mean there's been a lot of good talks, but I think the – the introductions have been among the best; and now, it's my turn and I've got double-duty here and I never know exactly what I'm going to say, but I was talking to Lorraine Hedtke earlier and I said, how long have you and John been married? And she – I said, because I've got to introduce them today and she said, well, Gerald and John were married long before Lorraine and I. So the old partnership continues. It's also the case that we've had some love affairs develop out of our conventions, our conferences, our work shops and so forth. But I think the most successful one so far has actually been Lorraine and John and maybe Gerald and John are another good couple. They have New Zealand side, they are both – worked together in New Zealand a long time ago doing work in narrative therapy and narrative mediation, and they are really well known for their work in narrative mediation and I was fortunate enough to be a reader on their latest book which is being published – has been published and is now available in our bookstore, and it's called When Stories Clash, Addressing Conflict with Narrative Mediation. And I think it's just an absolutely wonderful book that would be able to be shared among students as well as faculty and other people in the public because it so clearly addresses how to go about this type of work and it's written in an interesting fashion as well. They've written longer, broader books on the same topic and they've been collaborating for a long time in this arena. Gerald has actually a job here in San Diego and he was one of the inspirational leaders in having this conference here. He also works in the Department of Counseling and School Psychology, its San Diego State and he is in the marriage and family therapy program. And you may know that all of our volunteers are his students who have yet to be graded for the semester, right. 

00:03:20
GERALD MONK Yeah. 

00:03:20
MARIANNE  So we thank them for their – their work here. John has a job, a day job as well as a Professor in CalTech at San Bernardino. Bernardin? 

00:03:40
JOHN WINSLADE Bernardino. 

00:03:40
MARIANNE Bernardino. And then, another school that I don't know how to pronounce, but it's Dominguez? 

00:03:50
JOHN WINSLADE Dominguez Hills. 

00:03:55
MARIANNE Forget Dominguez Hills, okay. And John also does workshops all over the world and is – is just a darling in his presentations and the two of them are going to be with us today to express their views on narrative mediation, mediation conflict and intimate relationships. And I also should mention that Gerald has a special – specialty which is collaborative divorce. So if any of you have thoughts along those lines, he's the guy we'll talk to. So without further ado, I'll let you start and is always alphabetical? 

00:04:45
GERALD MONK Yes. 

00:04:45
JOHN WINSLADE He's got the mike. 

00:04:45
GERALD MONK  Thank you, Marianne. It was a pleasure to be introduced by you. 

00:04:55
JOHN WINSLADE Thank you, Marianne. 

00:04:55
GERALD MONK  It was a heartache to follow when I saw you on stage in 1997 at the Young Scientific Psychologies Conference in New York and you started disrobing on stage. Do you remember that? We can't follow that. 

00:05:10
MARIANNE Yes. 

00:05:10
JOHN WINSLADE  Yes. 

00:05:15
GERALD MONK It was quite a lot. I'm – I want to say a couple of things. We're going to backwards and forwards with our presentation. I'm going to say of few, John is. The idea we had was we wanted to move quite fast through some – some slides to give you a – a snapshot or a Readers' Digest version of narrative mediation. So we're going to go pretty fast and then at the end, we've got some clips to show you that are illustrating some of the ideas in our work. And John was cracking up this morning when he said, people are very enthusiastic about how I last spoke because we started with 278 pages and now we've got it down to 120 and the next publication is a pamphlet. So we're going in the right direction. 

00:06:15
Mediating Conflict in Intimate 

00:06:15
Relationships 

00:06:15
Gerald Monk and John Winslade 

00:06:15
GERALD MONK So Mediating Conflict in Intimate Relationships. Intimate relationships, we're thinking of things like mediating couples who are divorcing, conflict in families with siblings, with parents, and intimate relationships like doctors and patients who work together and there's been some kind of breach of trust in some way, things of that nature we think of mediating intimate relationships. 

00:06:45
A narrative perspective 

00:06:45
In conflict, people often feel caught up in a story that is 

00:06:45
painful and they are not happy about it. 

00:06:45
They would prefer the relationship with the other person to 

00:06:45
be in a different place. 

00:06:45
Narrative conflict resolution involves separating from the 

00:06:45
conflict story and growing the story of relationship they 

00:06:45
would prefer 

00:06:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, so this is an effort, this slide, to put it into three sentences, it's an effort towards the pamphlet, if you like. So I'm – I'll just sort of speak to these three sentences and then if anyone needs to catch the early bus. And I'm not going to read the slide out, but you can read it over there, but I want to just emphasize two or three aspects. One is the idea that people get caught up in a story as I think often we know the sense of being involved in some sense of conflict without having the intention of getting into it. Well, the conscious desire to – to start a conflict, but we often find ourselves caught up in it which is why children's say something like, you know, he started it; no, she started it; no, he started it. So I – I – I think of conflict experiences as very often like that. 

00:07:35
A narrative perspective 

00:07:35
In conflict, people often feel caught up in a story that is 

00:07:35
painful and they are not happy about it. 

00:07:35
They would prefer the relationship with the other person to 

00:07:35
be in a different place. 

00:07:35
Narrative conflict resolution involves separating from the 

00:07:35
conflict story and growing the story of relationship they 

00:07:35
would prefer 

00:07:35
JOHN WINSLADE And – and there are some people who perhaps really enjoy being in conflict or will get a buzz out of it, maybe all of us do at some point; but in my experience, many of us actually find it painful and struggle with it when we're in the middle of something that is – that is conflictual. And if we do that, then, there's often a sense which is implicit that we would prefer something else and what we understand is a process that helps bringing out that implicit desire or preference for something else to make it more explicit. 

00:08:10
A narrative perspective 

00:08:10
In conflict, people often feel caught up in a story that is 

00:08:10
painful and they are not happy about it. 

00:08:10
They would prefer the relationship with the other person to 

00:08:10
be in a different place. 

00:08:10
Narrative conflict resolution involves separating from the 

00:08:10
conflict story and growing the story of relationship they 

00:08:10
would prefer 

00:08:10
JOHN WINSLADE  Now, the third sentence is a critical one and it in many ways departs from what has often been thought about and has often been written about and trained about in the conflict resolution mediation especially field where in my reading of it, people are often invited to solve a conflict, solve the conflict story and what we're suggesting here is that you don't actually always need to solve the conflict, you sometimes need to just find the different story that takes people onto different trajectory that maybe sits alongside or somewhere after the side of the conflict story and once we can identify that, we can help people separate from a story that is bringing about a conflict and move to a different story of relationship and help to grow there so that it stands as an option for people and competes with the – the story of the conflict. So that's a slightly different aim, I believe, than what is often thought about in terms of conflict resolution. We go to the next slide. 

00:09:20
People live their lives through stories 

00:09:20
Stories that people tell themselves 

00:09:20
Stories people tell each other 

00:09:20
Background stories from our cultural world 

00:09:20
Some stories are more coherent than others 

00:09:20
Some stories are more rehearsed than others 

00:09:20
Some stories dominate others 

00:09:20
GERALD MONK  I'm interested in connecting with Mark's story, the one about the guys ready to take the person's wallet and we look up here the – the notion that background stories emerge from the cultural world. We all kind of know that when we're in a dark alley and there are six men approach us, wanting something from us, we kind of know how normally that unfolds. There are cultural stories about being in dark allies and about what it means for six men to come together at a time in the night and then we're expecting something to follow. It's – that's really a cultural story, a background set of assumptions and one of the things that we're interested in as narrative mediators is disrupting dominant cultural stories and being creative and do things on the spur of the moment to interrupt the trajectory of those cultural ideas about how we should go on or what we should do next. So I – I – I thought that was just such a wonderful story to connect with what we were doing. 

00:10:45
People live their lives through stories 

00:10:45
Stories that people tell themselves 

00:10:45
Stories people tell each other 

00:10:45
Background stories from our cultural world 

00:10:45
Some stories are more coherent than others 

00:10:45
Some stories are more rehearsed than others 

00:10:45
Some stories dominate others 

00:10:45
GERALD MONK We all know that people tell stories about you, right. 

00:10:55
MARIANNE No. 

00:10:55
GERALD MONK Every one of you -- and I just saw one about you. 

00:11:00
JOHN WINSLADE You just saw something. 

00:11:00
GERALD MONK We grow – we grow up – we – we grow up with stories that are told about us right from when we were really young and the parents and the siblings are the ones often the first ones to tell stories about who we are as people in the world and those stories matter. Teachers have stories about us and their stories matter a lot in terms of learning. So there are – this story is so powerful in shaping our lives. We are – we are meaning making creatures. We have to – we have to put events together to make meaning and we use the narrative, don't we? All of us do. So this – so we're harnessing the very practices that human beings have always lived by. So not only do we have stories about the other and when you're having a conflict, guess how the story goes. When you're having a conflict with someone, they are the perpetrator, they are the violator, they – they are the betrayer; and often, the person who's telling the story is the benign reporter. So we tell stories and conflicts like this and not only do we – not only do we are so positioned and afflicted by other people's stories, but we also create stories about ourselves. So we're interested in both those elements. 

00:12:35
JOHN WINSLADE Don't complicate that a little bit, dude, because -- 

00:12:35
GERALD MONK You always have complicated things, John, right from the first word today. 

00:12:40
JOHN WINSLADE Fine. And I think it's also – I mean a lot of people think about narrative practices being – being about the stories that people tell and changing the stories and getting to a difficult story told. I think it's also important to note that stories are lived and performed, not just told and sometimes, the telling is actually implicit in a conversation and often a good mediation is about shaping the story differently through the way it is built in conversation, not just told as a single story so far. 

00:13:10
People live their lives through stories 

00:13:10
Stories that people tell themselves 

00:13:10
Stories people tell each other 

00:13:10
Background stories from our cultural world 

00:13:10
Some stories are more coherent than others 

00:13:10
Some stories are more rehearsed than others 

00:13:10
Some stories dominate others 

00:13:10
JOHN WINSLADE And some stories, of course, are different than others; some are more coherent than others. Now, thinking of the – the parent who tells a lengthy story about what's going on in the family and you ask the – the young teenager, you know, to say what their experience and their perspective was and you get three words. So the – that's – the young person's story needs to be developed in order to grow greater coherence. Some stories are more rehearsed, they're repeated many times, they're told to many people, and they get a quality about the result of that, that often gives them a sense of strength and power; and some stories are dominant because they carry more cultural resonance with the discourses of the world in which we live than others. I want to also add another complication, if you like, and that is to refer to the concepts that developed out of the work of Michel Foucault and particularly his uses of the word discourse because he talked about how discourses work as under just sort of slightly below the surface shaping many of the things that people say and do or giving form to them or, you know, giving background assumptions and meanings out of which people draw to make sense of – of their own experience and he often has talked about how these discourses could be represented in statements, statements which sort of summarize the taken for granted assumptions that people operate from. Here are some examples of those. 

00:14:40
Narratives are formed out of discourse 

00:14:40
Discursive assumptions: statements 

00:14:40
a man should be the head of the household 

00:14:40
while privilege is based on natural superiority 

00:14:40
women are more emotional than men 

00:14:40
homosexuality is not natural 

00:14:40
disabled persons should not be sexual 

00:14:40
Michel Foucault 

00:14:40
JOHN WINSLADE You can see that those are often – they're often unremarkable, but these are examples of some of the statements which are – have been strongly contested and we can all think about the counter discourses that might be formed in relation to some of those particular discourses. So the stories that people live and tell and share and bring into conflict situations, I think, draw from these background discourses as well. 

00:15:05
We are all multi-storied 

00:15:05
Life is more complex than any one story. 

00:15:05
There are always gaps, contradictions, exceptions, 

00:15:05
alternative storylines. 

00:15:05
GERALD MONK Now, we've heard this idea before. I referred to Ken's book, The Saturated Self which spoke about multiphrenic human beings; and of course, when we – we think about our lives, we have multiple ways of being in multiple contexts and so do people in conflict that we can be seduced into believing when people are in a very strong conflict that the interactions that they have can seem like the only account of what has happened, the only description of what has occurred, but as narrative mediators, we know that there's so much more beyond the rigid, narrow, tightly-focused conflict story. We know this – we know this so much more and Michael White in the photograph was hugely important in helping us think about the value of the story and its relationship to conflict and conflict transformation. And John is going to speak a little about Michael just right now. 

00:16:25
JOHN WINSLADE You know, it's – it's quite a big thing for New Zealanders to create Australians, but – but Michael really deserved it and one of the reasons we wanted to bring his photograph here, we – we could have had the photo of Ken Gergen into The Saturated Self there, but we chose to have Michael White's photo there because four and a half years ago, Michael White was in here in San Diego and he spoke in his final workshop about this very concept about multi-storied selves, multi-storied, what he was talking about all kinds of aspects of multiple stories and later that evening when Gerald and I were – were having dinner with him, with Lorraine and Stacey and Walter Bera, he collapsed and died about four days later. So it's – it seems significant to be at a conference in San Diego and to honor that contribution and to mention this in the – in the midst of our presentation today. So I just wanted to do that. 

00:17:35
Goal of narrative mediation 

00:17:35
Separate from close identification with conflict story 

00:17:35
Identify a counter-story of relationship 

00:17:35
Re-author the relationship story in order to resolve 

00:17:35
the conflict. 

00:17:35
Establish a narrative that is incompatible with the 

00:17:35
ongoing conflict 

00:17:35
Negotiate from within counter-story 

00:17:35
JOHN WINSLADE So what are we trying to do in a narrative mediation process? What might be the goal of it, if you like? I want to draw a distinction, I'm not going to read those slide -- the statements on the slide out, but I want to draw a distinction between what I read in the problem-solving mode of mediation which is most common which I think goes like this. Let's try and do a deal that solves the problem between us so that we can restore the relationship back to a better footing and I think when I tried to do that, the difficult part was that people often in a state of conflict between each other when they're kind of deeply committed to two – so two very competing and powerfully conflicted stories only reluctantly do a deal and the deal sometimes falls apart later and it falls apart because this – the – the deal is not rooted strongly enough in a relationship story which is sustainable. So what we have tried to focus on is doing it the other way around. So instead of doing a deal, solving the problem in order to fix the relationship, shifting the relationship onto a different footing first, identifying a story of relationship that is going in a different trajectory and a different direction, and then using that to invoke a spirit of difference that within which people can then negotiate and often, in my experience, negotiate much more easily and fluently than they do when they're kind of embedded in a – in stories that are very conflicted. So I just want to highlight, if you like, that contrast and that difference between what we're trying to do and some of the other approaches to mediation. 

00:19:25
Double listening 

00:19:25
There is always Listen for the but 

00:19:25
a conflict story Hear the word “but” as 

00:19:25
indicating two stories 

00:19:25
a counter story of a 

00:19:25
different relationship “I was really angry at the 

00:19:25
time but I calmed down 

00:19:25
later.“ 

00:19:25
Conflict resolution is about 

00:19:25
accessing the different 

00:19:25
story & asking which one 

00:19:25
they prefer 

00:19:25
GERALD MONK I love this concept of double listening. I am going to read some things from the slides. There is always a conflict story, a counter story of a different relationship is always there too. Some of my students, some of them here, when we've done training together and they read about narrative mediation, narrative therapy, they get very excited and go, these are very, very cool ideas and they so want to talk about the alternative story, the – the story of cooperation, the story of peace, the story of things working out, and they just can't wait to get there and they start off and yeah, I got to hear a little bit about the problem, and then, okay, let's go to the counter story, let's – let's hear the story of – of hope and – but my client doesn't want to join the story of hope, they're not wanting to go there. 

00:20:25
JOHN WINSLADE  So obvious. 

00:20:30
GERALD MONK It's so obvious, it's like this so many things there, but they don't want to go there and I don't even know what actually is working there, all I can hear is problem after problem, I don't even know it. Maybe I'll get another theory that might help me better and – and one of the things that people forget about when you're – when you're a mediator and you've got parties in conflict, people forget about the processes that individuals have gone through to come to the table in the first place, how did people get to sit with a mediator in the first place and what does that mean? And so double listening is always paying attention to what is not front and center, what's not the problem story and looking always for other descriptions. 

00:21:25
Double listening 

00:21:25
There is always Listen for the but 

00:21:25
a conflict story Hear the word “but” as 

00:21:25
indicating two stories 

00:21:25
a counter story of a 

00:21:25
different relationship “I was really angry at the 

00:21:25
time but I calmed down 

00:21:25
later.“ 

00:21:25
Conflict resolution is about 

00:21:25
accessing the different 

00:21:25
story & asking which one 

00:21:25
they prefer 

00:21:25
GERALD MONK And the example there is I was really angry at the time, oh, we're so good at tuning into people being really angry, they were really angry, did you notice how angry they were? But then, I calm down later. So tell me more about how angry you were, no, no, no, tell us how you calm down, how did that happen? So double listening is always listening for what's in-between, what's implied, what follows the but. 

00:22:00
JOHN WINSLADE Whatever. I had a couple who came – did a – did a divorce mediation with a couple once and in the middle of the conflict, they were intensely arguing about custody issues to do with their two young children and in the middle of this – in the middle of the conflict, they told us – they told me in the – just as an aside in the middle of the conversation like it didn't matter, they just sort of dropped this in as a little piece of information and then just moved on and they said, one of our children recently got sick and ended up in a hospital and for the two weeks that the child was in hospital, they stopped arguing, they stopped the conflict completely and during those two weeks, they worked out a roster by which they – they cared for each of the children, one would be at the hospital and the other would be at home, they cared for – they talked together on the phone, they made arrangements, they looked after the children, and the word they use, they actually used this word, they described it as teamwork and then the child got better and came out of hospital and they dropped the teamwork and went back to the argument, and they told me this and then started to move on. And I said, hang on a second, I'd like to understand more about the – the teamwork that you went through, how did you go about that? And they actually said to me, why do you want to know that – about that, it's not important, that's not what we're here for? And I said, well, I'm interested in that because if you could do teamwork during those two weeks, if we paid attention to that and studied it a little bit, it might help us to understand how you might do teamwork in this new situation that you're entering into. And they, with a little bit of explanation and persuasion, were willing to have that conversation and -- and that's what we mean by double listening and sometimes, it involves hearing those little moments of aside, the little things that people drop into the conversation without actually giving much importance, the little moments when people say, well, of course, such and such; paying attention to those often brings forward a different story. 

00:24:15
The person is 

00:24:15
not the problem; 

00:24:15
the problem is 

00:24:15
the problem. 

00:24:15
Michael White 

00:24:15
JOHN WINSLADE  Now, back to – continuing to honor Michael White, we wanted to include his important statement, his aphorism which I still find full of all kinds of resonance. And the person is not the problem; the problem is the problem, a simple statement that steps out of deficit discourse, steps out of pathologizing, steps out of the blame that people are often trading in the course of conflict and the stories that they tell about what's been going on in a relationship and says, let's pay attention to the problem as a problem and keep it separate from any kind of attribution to the personhood of any individual and it sets up what the next slide is about. Could we slip – move to that one? 

00:25:05
Build an externalizing conversation 

00:25:05
Speak about the conflict as a 3rd party. 

00:25:05
Attribute the suffering to the conflict. 

00:25:05
Ask how the dispute caused difficulties between the parties 

00:25:05
rather than how the parties caused the dispute 

00:25:05
JOHN WINSLADE  It sets up the practice of externalizing conversation. Gerald, do you want to speak about that? 

00:25:10
GERALD MONK You speak that well. And then I'll do the job, you go after that. 

00:25:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. You have a little rest there, Gerald. 

00:25:20
[sil.] 

00:25:25
JOHN WINSLADE Ken spoke about this last night, the – the grammatical shift that externalizing language used in conversations and mediation and – and another context as well can bring about, it's kind of a grammatical or linguistic shift that -- that produces if we continue with it and use it consistently a shift in the grammar of relationship as well. And by the way, it's not just therapists and mediators who use it, advertisers use the concept of externalizing language all the time. Here's one example that I heard once on the radio, it went like this. Has your credit card run away with you over the holiday period? You can see that avoids making the person into the problem, blames the credit card and produces a smile and a much more response -- much more powerful response. And advertisers know what works, right, because they get a response in terms of business and – and money for a particular organization, it's – it was obviously a credit consolidation kind of agency. So using those kind of externalizing language brings out a different grammar of relationship. 

00:26:40
GERALD MONK And there are some examples. When you're working with couples who are divorcing, issues of betrayal are very prominent, issues are humiliation, distrust, hatefulness. And couples never come to us and say, you know, I'm – I've been really badly affected by betrayal, it's – it's – the distrust is really – has harmed me and our relationship a lot, but have never heard that. Instead, I say – instead, we hear, you know, this hateful, betraying, a despicable human being and it's in conflict stories, the person giving the account of the other, it's always an internalized description about their character, their personality, their – the human beingness, it's never about the relationship. 

00:27:45
Externalizing questions 

00:27:45
What might we call this whole situation? 

00:27:45
How is the anxiety interfering with you? 

00:27:45
How did the idea that you were entitled to treat her that 

00:27:45
way convince you? 

00:27:45
What does that voice try to persuade you about? 

00:27:45
GERALD MONK And so externalizing is all about the dance of moving away from internalizing descriptions of the other, to saying, what has this betrayal done to your relationship that stopped you being able to work together to assist your children to have your support or how has this distrust stopped you from being able to figure out some of the tough financial issues you've got to grapple with? Externalizing creates so much space and so much freedom to be able to go places in the mediation that you just are not otherwise able to go to. So it's being an enormous assistance, that particular practice. 

00:28:30
Mapping the effects 

00:28:30
Ask about the effects of Past, present & future 

00:28:30
the conflict (or IT) What damage has it done? 

00:28:30
Asking about causes What effect is it having 

00:28:30
makes the conflict seem right now? 

00:28:30
inevitable 

00:28:30
It is more productive of If it were to keep on 

00:28:30
change to ask about happening where might 

00:28:30
effects things end up? 

00:28:30
GERALD MONK So there, I'm giving some examples, not – not only of externalizing but also about mapping the effects of the problem on persons and so we might use the externalized description this conflict, if we don't quite know what to name it yet, because it's not come in the form of betrayal, people don't talk that way yet; we might just start off with it, what has this situation or what has it done to you? How is it affecting you? The point there about asking about causes makes the conflict seem inevitable. We found it's not helpful to dwell on trying to problem solve by first figuring out who caused what, very appreciate inquiry for Diana – Diana is nodding. It doesn't tend to help but looking at the effects of events that have transpired, that creates opportunities for people to be galvanized into some new action.

00:29:35
JOHN WINSLADE  The effects you notice there on the right-hand column can be in the past, they can be right there in the room in the present or they can be in the future. So it's often very powerful question to ask if this was to keep on going, if this conflict was to keep on going for the next week, the next month, the next year, what would that be like? And often, people shudder at the thought that it would continue and it becomes, I think, quite motivating for people to think about what they would prefer in by way of some kind of difference. Next, thanks.

00:30:15
JOHN WINSLADE The next task is to grow the counter story and this might be begun by asking the question which I've founded increasingly important to ask when people are telling, have told a story of great suffering and pain and conflict and what would you prefer? What might be better? It's the kind of point where often appreciative inquiry takes up the questioning, if you like. And – and what we get are the – the different ideas, the story of teamwork in that example that I told. Maybe people have a sense of a different kind of conversation or they have moments when things have gone better or in divorcing couples, the pickup and drop-off of children has just happened smoothly rather than being painful and protracted and argumentative and then we're interested in exploring how that happened and linking exceptions as they – they are found, exceptions to the conflict and its dominance when those exceptions are found and they're linked together, they become a story because the story is something that moves through time and actually has some coherence because it's organized according to some ideas and some themes. That's the way to grow a story; and of course, it's going to take a little while before it has enough strength to compete with the – the problem story or the conflict story that has had already a lot of energy built into it. And – and – and in the process, people's value systems might be invoked, which do you value more, like how does this – this preferred story fit with what you value and what you believe in and what you care about and gradually, that story might be strengthened.

GERALD MONK  Well, now that you heard what Jacob said, what difference does that make? Yesterday, we – was that yesterday we did the training? 

00:32:20
JOHN WINSLADE It was only yesterday, yes. 

00:32:20
GERALD MONK Yes, yes, we – we work with this – this scenario all day of a employee who had a – a dear friend who they worked with in this restaurant called Pastor and Coffee and this person was killed in an accident and the person who – that was in the accident, the another employee had accidentally killed them, they were in a car and the person who died was in a motorcycle and so we had two participants in this conflict, one was the manager of the restaurant who didn't quite know what to do with this awful situation of this loss and just decided the best way to do it was to carry on and get the job done. But this other employee who had lost their dear friend was so mortified and – that this wasn't being paid attention to in the workplace was so distressed, contacted her union and said, this is not okay. I want that man who killed my friend fired. I want them gone. That's what I want. And so that was the request of one of the parties, just fire – just fire that employee and then my life can return to – to normal. When we interviewed the manager, we discovered that the manager had – the way they had dealt with the loss in – in the past had done it privately, you know, you lose someone who's a member of the family, you don't make a fuss of it, it's like that very Anglo, British, New Zealand, pakeha idea that you just suck it up and you move on because someone has died and you don't make a thing of it and when the two came together, the manager said, you know, what was in my mind was thinking that the way to deal with this loss, the best thing to do was just to move on, because that's what I did with my – with my brother when he died and so when the story started, it was, hey, look, I'm the manager, I'm trying to make this – this restaurant work and just get the job done, I thought it was the right thing. When the employee who had lost her friend heard the manager listen to her and listen to her distress, the manager was very moved and said, you know what, I had never thought about addressing a death before in a way that you're telling me I should as the manger; this is very moving to me, I need to rethink about how to be a manger and also, I need to rethink about the loss that has occurred with my own brother. The employee who wanted – I think his name was Rodriguez, fired saw the – saw the emerging changes in the manager forgot all about the idea of wanting to fire the employee, her – her – her colleague and realized that things have changed and so I – I'm thinking of that story yesterday in contrasting that how the story was when it began which was I just want this problem solved and this person fired and I hate my workplace, change to we can create something different. Now, right there, we went backwards and forwards, seeing the effects of the problem story and – and – and the counter story; and it's not that the problem story is going to go away because those memories are still there, those events transpired, it's not that they disappear, evaporate, it's still hanging around, it could be quite ready to come back if the manager started not paying attention to the relational space of the – of the restaurant. So I thought – I thought of that – that scenario when we were talking about counter story.

JOHN WINSLADE  Thank you. Next slide. So this is just the last slide of the – the summary of – of our kind of ideas and approach and context that we've been focusing on, and it kind of maps out the process which goes in a nice, neat, tidy, linear, movement from A to Z; and I hope you'll appreciate that I said zee instead of zed; and of course, that's how all conversations go and all relationships go, right, but the idea here is not that we kind of are suggesting that actually, it's more that, you know, when I'm in the middle of a conversation, I need some idea in my head when I'm getting stuck about where we're going and where we might – and so I can answer the question where are we up to. So it might start with kind of rather than doing what many people do which is let's identify the problem, start with people's hopes, start with their – with some element that might eventually become part of a counter story, don't always do this but often, it's very, very helpful. What are you hoping for? What has affected you here in this room, express, as – in terms of some kind of hope? Moving on to doing it, listening to the – the stories of what's happened, doing the kind of double listening that we talked about, using externalizing language and mapping the effects of a problem issue and then gradually opening a counter story and growing it, giving it a name, maybe, to give it more strength, finding the back story behind it, that grows it and it's – and gives it a history and exploring what kind of future it might lead to. So now, we're going to actually move to showing you some clips that we've taken from several videos, a couple of videos actually and sort of giving you examples of what we're talking about in action. So let's abstract more actual. Yes. Let's try this first clip. Oh, sorry, before you start, Naveed, yeah, this – these are from a couple of videos that Lucy Vail has – was the director for and what we've done is in order to show a brief one or two-minute clips taken pieces out of the video and just edited them down so that some things are omitted. What I need you to understand is that the rough editing that you'll see is mine, not Lucy's, right. Lucy had it beautifully arranged, but I've kind of condensed it a little bit for the sake of getting to the earl bus, you know. 

00:39:35
Groundrules are negotiated 

00:39:35
rather than imposed 

00:39:35
JOHN WINSLADE Any other sort of safety issues or – or guidelines that you'd like to put in place that would help us to go as the way you want it to go? 

00:39:45
GEENA  Safety issues. 

00:39:50
JOHN WINSLADE  Yeah, like sometimes, people are concerned with, you know, ruling out some ways of speaking as being off-limits or no – no shouting or no -- 

00:40:05
BRENDA Name calling. 

00:40:10
JOHN WINSLADE Name calling, that kind of stuff, right, what are you – what are you thinking, what would you – what would make it okay for you to have a good conversation? 

00:40:15
BRENDA I think, yeah, just keeping the voices down. 

00:40:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So voices down and you agreed on that. Anything else? 

00:40:25
GEENA  Basically that I think we've had a problem with that in the past where we would yell over each other and we didn't accomplish anything. So we'll just sieve them down. 

00:40:40
JOHN WINSLADE So you'd like something different than that? 

00:40:40
GEENA Yeah, so we can listen to each other. 

00:40:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So one of the guidelines for our conversation was being that it would involve and keeping voices down. 

00:40:45
GEENA  Yes. 

00:40:50
BRENDA Hmm. 

00:40:50
JOHN WINSLADE Is it right for you? 

00:40:50
BRENDA Hmm. 

00:40:50
JOHN WINSLADE Anything else? 

00:40:50
BRENDA  I think also talking. 

00:40:55
JOHN WINSLADE Talking? 

00:40:55
BRENDA Because when I can get anywhere, we're not – we're ignoring the problem not talking. 

00:41:05
JOHN WINSLADE So it's important to address and talk about the problems -- 

00:41:05
BRENDA Yes. 

00:41:05
JOHN WINSLADE That are here. 

00:41:05
BRENDA Yes. 

00:41:05
JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. Okay. Anything else? 

00:41:10
GEENA  Maybe can we validate each other's feelings, could it ever get to that point? Let's hope so, but -- 

00:41:20
JOHN WINSLADE So there are – there are strong feelings that your feeling need to be validated between you? 

00:41:25
GEENA Yes. 

00:41:25
JOHN WINSLADE  How does that sound to you? 

00:41:30
BRENDA Hmm. 

00:41:30
Hopes for the conversation are 

00:41:30
first elements of a counter story 

00:41:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. The question I was going to just ask you is about what you're hoping for out of this conversation and I guess you're starting to speak about that, that will be a kind of conversation where people would listen to each other, they would talk about the important issues and they would validate each other's feelings. Anything else that you would be hoping for? 

00:41:55
GEENA We would learn how to communicate because I don't think we ever learned how to communicate. 

00:42:00
JOHN WINSLADE  Really. You were going to say something? 

00:42:05
BRENDA I would say pertaining to this particular issue that we can kind of come to a resolution here and not have to take it to lawyers or to the court, that we can resolve it amongst ourselves, you know, this kind of family issue and I think that we – it's important that we resolve it between ourselves. 

00:42:25
JOHN WINSLADE So there's a need for the kind of communication that we've described and there's also a need to resolve some things. Is that fair enough? Is that what you're saying? 

00:42:35
BRENDA Yes. 

00:42:35
JOHN WINSLADE Do you agree with that? 

00:42:35
GEENA Yes. 

00:42:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:42:40
JOHN WINSLADE These are two – this is a story of two sisters who are in a dispute over will after their mother died and this just comes from early in the conversation where I had actually asked them about guidelines for the conversation, like what kind of guidelines did they want to have? Now, a lot of people treat that as being just a simple process issue. I think the content is equally important because what they're saying here is not just an entry point to, you know, rules for the conversation, it's more about what they – that contained within their assumption – their ideas about talking nicely to each other or not raising voices or addressing issues or whatever are – are intentions for where they want their relationship to go. So I'm hearing that if I'm double listening, it's more than just about the guidelines and the rules, it's actually – and I do this deliberately by inviting them to talk about those rather than me setting the guidelines or the rules and what comes out are elements of a what may be later built into a counter story. It's followed up with a question about their hopes for where the conversation may go and Gerald is going to show a clip that will illustrate that anymore unless you wanted to comment anymore about this. 

00:43:55
GERALD MONK I do. 

00:43:55
JOHN WINSLADE What do you want? 

00:43:55
GERALD MONK Did you notice John wasn't satisfied with the first answer and said, was there anything else? Or do you have anything else to add? I think forgot exactly the – the phrasing. But it does give good illustrations of narrative mediation, of the stance of the mediator being very curious and knowing that there is a lot more that's not yet being said and by being a little persistent and not interrogatory but creatively persistent, you find – you keep getting more and more information than you would have got if you had just accepted the first answer. So I thought this – this was a great example of that. 

00:44:40
JOHN WINSLADE Can I just respond to that? Actually, what I've come to think of is that I actually have a favorite question that I like to ask in all kinds of interviews more than any other question and it's a really simple one, it's got two words and the question is what else? It often is one of the most productive things to ask in my experience. Next slide. 

00:45:00
GERALD MONK  I always like to start with the – the final outcome in mind and so what I'd like for you each to do for a few minutes is to think about what would be a – a – a good outcome from our time together and even to think about this time we have, this session, as we're kind of completing the session, what would be some of the things you would be most appreciating about what your – the progress you're making and what you're getting out of talking together. So I'm fine about either of you starting off and we'll just go backwards and forwards through the – through the process. 

00:45:40
DAVID Well, it's actually something that we've both talked about at the beginning of this process. We've had friends who have gone through some bitter custody battles and divorce and we've really, both of us, you know, back when we were together saw just how it tore the family apart and the destructive cause it had on both the relationship of both parents and with the child, you know, dragging the child in and we've both had a discussion. 

00:46:15
GERALD MONK Now that your child, I understand it's Sam. 

00:46:15
DAVID Sam. 

00:46:15
MONICA Hmm. 

00:46:15
GERALD MONK Who is five years old, is that correct? 

00:46:15
DAVID That's right, yeah. 

00:46:15
GERALD MONK  Okay. Yes. 

00:46:20
DAVID And we both agree that if, you know, whenever it came down to it or something ever came up that bring us into a situation like we're in now, we would go mediation and try and have a – you know, a collaborative divorce as opposed to, you know, having one of these long, drawn-out custody battles. So -- 

00:46:40
GERALD MONK So one of the things you're wanting is to be able to collaborate together to work through whatever needs to be worked through with an outcome that's collaborative and doesn't end up in some long, drawn-out legal process that is like your friends. 

00:46:55
DAVID Right. 

00:46:55
GERALD MONK So that's one of the things that you'd love. Okay. So how about you, Monica, what – what would be a great outcome for you? Let's think about even this session. 

00:47:10
MONICA Well, I mean the most important thing for me is just to make sure Sam is going to be okay. My main concern is that he's going to safe wherever he goes, that he's going to not feel the tension of whatever is going on. 

00:47:30
GERALD MONK Hmm. 

00:47:30
MONICA So I just – I just want to make sure he's going to be okay, that's my main concern. 

00:47:35
GERALD MONK Okay. 

00:47:35
MONICA That we work together as parents, you know, to just make sure he's okay, that's – that's my main thing. And make sure we take care of everything that needs to get taken care of and as best the way as we can, like David said before, we've just seen some horrible situations and I don't want to go that route. I mean -- 

00:48:00
GERALD MONK Okay. When I ask you that, you – you think of Sam and you want him to be protected. 

00:48:05
MONICA Yes. 

00:48:05
GERALD MONK Not harmed at all by this or -- 

00:48:05
MONICA No. 

00:48:05
GERALD MONK  To diminish the harm of this process that – that you're going through -- 

00:48:10
MONICA Right. 

00:48:10
GERALD MONK  Separating and to have his interest in mind and that he's safe, cared for. 

00:48:20
GERALD MONK So there you see a couple recently separated, having trouble negotiating, primary care arrangements, custodial care, and the dropping off, picking up of the child, and so that each parent is having time with the child. So we'll see a few clips of this couple trying to figure out, negotiate making a better arrangement for their child. 

00:48:50
JOHN WINSLADE The thing I wanted to comment on was the last point that the husband here is saying because it's often – it's wonderful that he's actually articulating there the difference between two kinds of relationship. One is the spousal relationship and the other is the parenting relationship. And often, I think in – in divorce mediation, the leftover pieces from the spousal relationship which – which have a lot of heat and – and fire in them contaminate the other relationship which people have struggled or have difficulty keeping separate. So I often find it really useful to keep those things – to establish those things as two separate relationships that these two people have, keep them as contrasted and separate as possible in the way that we talk about them and then when things do start to get heated up and – and problematic and the – the conflict story starts to be performed actively in front of our eyes, we can then say, now, is this part of your spousal relationship to what you were just saying or is this part of your relationship as parents, and do you wish you want to be which is important to focus on at this time, which one are we trying to actually keep in the center of our attention? So we're going -- 

00:50:05
GERALD MONK So now, distrust looms like a big shadow over the two of you in stopping you being able to see Sam and having the time you want with him and to build – keep building those connections and it creates for you this kind of – you kind of did this with your hands like this kind of I forgot the words you used, but this – I kind of feel like a sort of a tortured kind of experience on the one hand hearing Sam, what he's wanting to do and feeling really, really sad and seeing that, that could be resolved by Sam having those experiences and yet on the other hand, kind of protection is there and -- 

00:50:50
Evaluating Preferences and 

00:50:50
Exploring Future Directions 

00:50:50
GERALD MONK And so here you are at this point and I'm not in charge of what decisions you're going to make or what processes you will use, you've got some ideas, I think quite definite ideas about how this could be resolved. Your response to that is one where that's not acceptable. You see that as kind of an intrusion on your life, kind of some kind of violation and so what do you do to maintain us to have this sense of collaboration a sense of the best interest for Sam at this point, like I'm not – I'm not sure what I could offer you or suggest to you, I'm – I'm really asking you what do you do at this point? 

00:51:35
MONICA  No, I think I've already -- 

00:51:40
GERALD MONK You've come up with your – your best shot? 

00:51:45
MONICA And I want to like I want him to take a moment because I think that would be great, you know, I think that's enough time they would go to games together all the time and I'm not opposed to that at all, you know. 

00:51:55
GERALD MONK Right. 

00:51:55
MONICA And I – it's like – and it would help me out too, I mean I'm not going to lie and say, oh, I'm going to – you know-- 

00:52:05
GERALD MONK Do you – are you finding you're getting some – some wise advice, some counsel from the people that know you to help you manage the distrust issue? Is this – because oftentimes, in situations like that, people talk with their family, their friends, for advice, what do I do, like I want to protect Sam, but I also want to not be sad by cutting him off his – his dad and I'm just wondering what resources you're having to assist you to make the next step. 

00:52:35
GERALD MONK Did you notice the skill that I was endeavoring to model there? Externalizing what I – was what I was wanting to illustrate and focusing on the effects of distrust and what it – what it was doing to them and then also being aware of those of you that work in this area know that the people who are not in the room become enormously influential in shaping what goes forward, because you can have some really meaningful decisions, experiences made in the room of the people participating in this conflict and then they go home and then they start talking to their friends and their friends say, you didn't give in, did you? You weren't – you weren't going to let him have it, were you? Oh, I can't believe you did that, you need to be strong, you need to do some other thing. And so that was in my mind as I was asking about the kind of advice and guidance this fellow was receiving regarding managing building relationship. 

00:53:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, and one other thing to comment on in there, people who have had a background in therapy often need to sort of think through the issue in mediation of what to actually externalize because in therapy, you can maybe working with one person, you might be able to externalize something that someone is internalizing into themselves maybe as some kind of an identify story, what – what you're experiencing is problematic. You can't in mediation just do two of those because what you end up doing is still actually talking about two separate things and two different people's context. So I find it – I mean this – there are occasions when you can to do that temporarily, but the most useful externalizing and mediation is something that refers to the situation between the two people in the relationship and here the word distrust fitted for both of them and that's the important thing here, it fitted as a – as a description of what both of them were – were talking about and were able to experience and – and could see themselves as wanting to separate from and identify some preferred story in relation to that. 

00:54:55
JOHN WINSLADE  I mean that's a sort of an emotional response is having any other effects? I mean on your – I don't know, your health, well-being, finances, relationships, anything else? 

00:55:15
BRENDA Well, like stress. 

00:55:15
JOHN WINSLADE Stress? 

00:55:15
BRENDA Yeah, because I'm – I'm in the middle of trying to start a real business and you're not having really any support, you know, because you know, our parents have passed and she's my only sister and you know, not having that support and so she was just adding stress. 

00:55:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:55:30
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:55:30
JOHN WINSLADE And it sounds like it's a stressful time in terms of the business anyway, right. 

00:55:35
BRENDA Yeah, oh, yeah. 

00:55:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Anything else? 

00:55:35
BRENDA  No. 

00:55:40
JOHN WINSLADE I don't read, okay. 

00:55:40
BRENDA That's plenty. 

00:55:40
JOHN WINSLADE That it sounds plenty, yeah. 

00:55:40
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:55:40
GEENA Yeah. 

00:55:40
JOHN WINSLADE So what's the whole thing been doing to you, Jeena? 

00:55:45
GEENA Well, like I agree, stress, definitely. 

00:55:50
JOHN WINSLADE Stress for you too? 

00:55:50
GEENA Yeah, I quit my job to take care of our mother and – and it is sad that I expected more than what I got, but now we have to move and I don't know, the biggest thing is we would end everything, would end all conflict between each other if the will is split fairly, but I've had a hard time talking with her in the past and so that's why this time, I just want to take it out with somebody who can – my attorney or somebody that can help out split it fairly. 

00:56:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:56:25
GEENA Because her view of what's fair in my – I – my point of view isn't very. 

00:56:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:56:30
GEENA And so that's why I haven't been talking to you, kind of wanted to hold off on that for a while and – and I felt that Joey was part of it and that's my son. He didn't get to see his aunt on his birthday. It was a hard decision but I had to do that, I had to be firm for myself and there's just a lot of things that are going on. So -- 

00:56:55
Listening for 

00:56:55
the counter story 

00:56:55
JOHN WINSLADE Does it sort of go against your normal grain that you would not talk and not invite her – not invite Brenda to the birthday? 

00:57:00
GEENA  Yeah, I've never – not done that before -- 

00:57:05
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:57:05
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:57:05
GEENA With any family member, but it's how bad it hurt, that's how I thought it betrayed. 

00:57:10
JOHN WINSLADE So that was like an expression of how this conflict was affecting you. 

00:57:15
GEENA Exactly. 

00:57:15
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:57:15
JOHN WINSLADE  So several things there. One, you heard a small piece of the performance of the – of the conflict story, the things that were – that were eating away at the two – two sisters and then when they paused, what I sought to do was to refer to what they had talked about and there was more to it than this little clip as a standoff. So the problem was not them, it was the standoff between them; and it had them, it was having an affect on them, it was having the affect of – of not – not of – Brenda not being invited to a birthday part for Jeena's son. So that's the value of externalizing is that the – the blame is taken out, the – the lack of the invitation is not about any kind of intention to hurt so much as an effect, it's a downstream effect of the standoff and therefore gradually, the sense of blame starts to be diminished potentially if we keep talking in this vein. The other thing that's there is also a little element of – of double listening where I was asking the question, you know, on the one hand, this is what you're doing; but on the other hand, does that fit with how you normally want to think about your relationship with your sister? And she's able to say, no, it doesn't fit. So we've got an action taking place that doesn't fit with a preferred story of relationship and those double listening tries to sort of bring those discrepancies, those contradictions out, those complexities and actually put them to use. 

00:59:00
Scaling Questions 

00:59:00
GERALD MONK  With these things, it's never all or nothing completely, like let's say, for example, distrust was a percentage of how much distrust you had and some let's say that on one end of the continuum, someone was completely and utterly distrusting of everything of the other person and clearly, that's not the case because you're considering really wanting to have David have his time. So you obviously have some trust and zero was complete and utter trust so that you're completely, absolutely fine with no hesitation. What – what would you rate yourself right now in terms of the level of distrust that's keeping you kind of in the mode that you're in with Sam? 

00:59:50
MONICA So zero is –? 

00:59:55
GERALD MONK Zero is trust. 

00:59:55
MONICA Oh, trust? 

00:59:55
GERALD MONK Zero is trust, zero is no distrust percent at all and a 100% is complete and utter distrust, no trust whatsoever, you wouldn't be letting Sam near David and under any circumstance of distrust had got to the point where it was a 100%, what would it be right now? 

01:00:10
GERALD MONK  So that's a rather inarticulate, not well-presented example of scaling. If some of you do a solution – first, it's kind of embarrassing to show this clip in front of the students, but the scaling idea is – is also very helpful in illustrating, exemplifying the problem as an external description, and when you rate its effects, you're going to be able to create room for talking about the counter story because if distrust is not a 100%, as soon as it becomes 99, we're into the counter story of what is otherwise. So that was the point of that. 

01:01:00
Summarizing conflict effects 

01:01:00
JOHN WINSLADE So there are a number of things and I've just made a list of these here, the things that are – that it has done, this whole situation to affect you both and to affect your relationship and I'm wondering whether you want this to continue and perhaps develop further or whether you would prefer things to be in a different place. 

01:01:25
Asking the clients to take a 

01:01:25
position on the conflict 

01:01:25
JOHN WINSLADE And I know you kind of hinted at that already, but I just wanted to just be checking in relation to these effects that you just talked about what you would prefer. 

01:01:35
BRENDA Much rather have a better relationship and be able to use each other for support and really be more nice sisters, I guess. 

01:01:50
GEENA Yeah. 

01:01:50
JOHN WINSLADE Have a better relationship, use each other for support, you're right? 

01:01:55
BRENDA Hmm. 

01:01:55
JOHN WINSLADE  And what was that last thing about a sister relationship, what was it? 

01:02:05
BRENDA I guess actually act like sisters. 

01:02:05
GEENA Yeah. 

01:02:05
JOHN WINSLADE  Act like sisters, okay. And do you want to probably just ask Brenda a couple more things about that? 

01:02:20
GEENA Sure. 

01:02:20
Inquiring into the history 

01:02:20
of the counter story 

01:02:20
JOHN WINSLADE What – so what's the history of you supporting each other? I mean is that – you know, you've described between you over the years, but I'm just interested in the history of that. 

01:02:35
BRENDA I think we've intended to be there for each other, you know, like we've had the intentions, but I think we can do a lot better and -- 

01:02:45
JOHN WINSLADE So you – you would describe it as an intention that has sometimes not quite been carried as far as you would – 

01:02:55
BRENDA Yeah. 

01:02:55
JOHN WINSLADE You would like it, preferably? 

01:02:55
BRENDA Yeah. 

01:02:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:02:55
BRENDA Yeah. 

01:02:55
JOHN WINSLADE  So has that intention ever been manifested? I mean are there – are there any ways in which you have a sense of offering your support to Geena or experiencing her offering support to you? 

01:03:10
BRENDA Well, like I've – I'll come over and watch Joey or -- 

01:03:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, okay. 

01:03:15
BRENDA Or she's been actually showing up every now and then with me trying – get into my photography and -- 

01:03:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, how has she done that? 

01:03:25
BRENDA  Well, she came with me, I was going to different studios to rent and spaces for that, so she was actually there for that. 

01:03:35
JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. And what did that mean to you she did that? 

01:03:40
Landscape of meaning question 

01:03:40
BRENDA  That it was actually important to her, you know that – you know – you know, I'm not married and have – don't have kids and that whole family that – that still what I do is, you know, worthwhile and is not just some – I mean that it is important to me like she kind of realized it and it just that I guess she realized it was important to me even though other people might not see it as important. 

01:04:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So it was somehow validating for you? 

01:04:10
BRENDA Hmm. 

01:04:10
JOHN WINSLADE Is that fair? 

01:04:10
BRENDA Hmm, yeah, yeah. 

01:04:10
JOHN WINSLADE  That she took seriously something that some other people may not have taken seriously and saw how it important it was to you? 

01:04:20
BRENDA Yeah. 

01:04:20
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

01:04:20
BRENDA Hmm. 

01:04:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. And was that – does that qualify as acting like sisters? 

01:04:25
Suggesting a title for 

01:04:25
the counter story 

01:04:25
BRENDA I guess so. 

01:04:25
JOHN WINSLADE  It did at the time? 

01:04:30
BRENDA Hmm. 

01:04:30
JOHN WINSLADE And that's sort of what you had preferred to have more of here, right. 

01:04:30
BRENDA Yeah. 

01:04:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. How about you, Geena, try and come back and ask you the same question? I mean -- 

01:04:40
GEENA Sure. 

01:04:40
JOHN WINSLADE What would you prefer? I mean you said that you don't want these affects of this conflict between you to carry on and to create that ongoing distance between you. So what would you prefer, what would you – how would you describe it? 

01:04:50
JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. Several things there, one is we're here at this point moving from their statement of what they would prefer to kind of building some back story into those preferences. What they would prefer is to act like sisters, to be supportive of each other, to validate each other. But that's – those are nice, little ideas that won't actually compete with the effects of a – of a will and a discrepancy and an argument about that unless they are added to and built up into something that actually can be the basis for something different. So I was interested to help that – that story to grow and to be built. So I needed to ask about the background to it and what was interesting was when Geena responded to me asking about the background to validation of feelings, twice she said things like can't think of anything, I'll have to get back to you on that. And at that point, I can think one of two things. One, I can think, okay, I'm a hopeless mediator, this idea doesn't work, narrative mediation better be thrown out at this point, this doesn't get anywhere; or I can think the other thought which actually is the one I chose which is, um, it's only to be expected that if a story has been strong enough and dominant enough that it will actually take over somebody's experience and make them blind to other options, make them blind and make it harder to notice, make it harder to bring to mind even things that actually are that run counter to that. So once again, the other as well as asking what else, I'm asking the same question three times and persisting with it because I'm working on the I think a reasonable assumption that if you've got two people who have been sisters for this length of time, there has to be some moment in their experience where they've validated each other, supported each other, or acted like sisters and if they're not able to come up with it, it's because something else was dominating and blinding them to that rather than that it doesn't exist. 

01:07:00
JOHN WINSLADE So if your dad could speak, if your mom could speak in this meeting, what would they perhaps suggest as ways of discussing this so that you could reach some kind of agreement? I mean what – what kind of ideas would they suggest being brought up for you? 

01:07:20
GEENA  I think our dad would be mad at our mother for making the changes the end. 

01:07:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. What do you think? 

01:07:30
BRENDA  Think also that I mean where our intentions may be the will would be to make sure that we are – you know, we are okay and that we have hus, that we have someone to live and -- 

01:07:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

01:07:45
BRENDA You know, that -- that, that, you know, like their intentions would just to be to make sure that we're okay. 

01:07:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So if you could speak to each other in a way that kept your mom's and your dad's voices alive, what would you – what could you sort of suggest or offer to each other that would help resolve this at this time? 

01:08:10
GEENA  I'll give you the Francis skinwear and jewelry for painting, I don't know, but like something like maybe we can talk to or something. 

01:08:25
BRENDA Yeah. 

01:08:25
GEENA You know, because -- 

01:08:25
BRENDA  That isn't so much that the will has to stay set how it was I guess because it's more about us being happy and not so much about like they're – you know, what they had written down in the past, you know, and maybe things have changed and their intentions were addressed to -- 

01:08:45
JOHN WINSLADE To be happy. 

01:08:45
BRENDA Yeah. 

01:08:45
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

01:08:45
BRENDA  Yeah, you know, and that might have changed and say written the will. 

01:08:50
JOHN WINSLADE  So where does that lead you to, Brenda, that thought that maybe that you could honor your parents' best intentions rather than just piece of paper. 

01:09:05
BRENDA Yeah. 

01:09:05
JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? I mean, what might that lead you to maybe to suggest or offer to Geena? 

01:09:10
BRENDA  I mean I guess just I guess I'm open to have you see what each think would be fair and at least open to, you know, negotiate or making some changes to it. I'm not -- 

01:09:25
JOHN WINSLADE  So now the relationship story is on a very different footing, um, it's got there because we've actually articulated what it means to act like sisters, to support each other and to validate each other was the other thing they talked about, then they gradually moved to – to – to being open to some kind of a negotiation at this point and one of the things that helped them to do that was the invoking of their parents' voices as remembered voices in the conversation. This is not the negotiation complete that they needed to do, there's still another piece to that, but from that point, I would argue that the negotiation is going to be relatively straightforward, less obstructive, less painful, and much more likely to reach the kind of conclusion that they could both be happy with and might both be willing to stick with and one that would actually sustain their relationship forward in the forward. So – 

01:10:25
GERALD MONK  Can I say something? 

01:10:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah -- 

01:10:30
GERALD MONK And not only I think was it beautiful and artful to invoke the memories of these siblings' parents and what the parents might be wanting for them and bringing the spirit of the parents' vision for the daughters forward as they think about making the will, but did you notice John's voice tone? I'm – I always like to pay attention to the nonverbals, the – the soothing, warm, inviting voice tone I think really counts for a lot in – in helping people, those often – people go away remembering how people looked, what the expressions were on their faces, what the voice tones were like and – and some of the content is gone and – and that left with just unnameable feelings sometimes and I – I just liked that part of it. 

01:11:25
JOHN WINSLADE  Thank you, Gerald, and I would add to that by saying that you haven't seen the whole story obviously and you'd – there will be a different experience if you saw the whole thing, but my voice tone is not simply a technique, it's actually a response to what they've been saying. I'm actually moved by the stories that they've been saying. When they talk about being – one person talking about the other being the glue in the family and I appreciate that, that actually is a moment that affects me and it alters my voice tone, I think, if I'm responsive to it. 

01:11:55
GERALD MONK That's it. 

01:11:55
JOHN WINSLADE  That's it. We wanted to share with you some ideas from narrative mediation, that's it. 

01:12:00
GERALD MONK Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye.
