DAN Being a parent is the hardest thing I've ever done. 

00:00:55
NANCY This is a journey that is not for the faint of heart. 

00:00:55
NOREEN My parents, your parents, also at one point said, "What are you doing this for?" 

00:01:00
BETH We always felt strongly that we wanted to have a child in our life.

living adoption GAY PARENTS SPEAK 

00:01:05
Choosing to Adopt 

00:01:20
PAUL From the very beginning it was my assumption that I was going to be a father. 

00:01:20
Pam 

00:01:20
PAM We had the dog, we had the house, and it was like the natural progression of things. 

00:01:25
John 

00:01:25
JOHN My partner, from when we were in our early 20's - or mid 20's - he always wanted to have a child. And that was number was, and it was never a question that we couldn't do that because we were gay. 

00:01:40
Nancy 

00:01:40
NANCY For us it was, I mean, it started with a journey of trying to have another biological child and, and losing, um, uh, two in miscarriages and going through that. And then knowing we so desperately still wanted to be parents. 

00:01:50
PAM At first I was like, "Oh, I'll have a baby. It's no problem. We'll get some sperm, we'll get this done." Well, I-, I-, then I started going, "OK. Do I really need to do that?" 

00:02:00
Donna 

00:02:05
DONNA Neither one of us really thought about being a, a birth mom, so adoption was the, the choice for us. 

00:02:10
Ken 

00:02:10
KEN My mother is a public health nurse. And, I think, when I was in the fourth grade I heard these kids call my mother "mommy" and that just really, I was really jealous about that. By the time I was 16 and wanted her car, and was willing to drive her to work so I could get her car, and I heard these kids call her mommy. I just thought, "How sad that she's only there from 7:00 in the morning till 4:00 in the evening, and that's the only mommy they're gonna get. And, so, when I decided that I wanted to become a dad, I thought that adoption was the way to go. 

00:02:40
Nancy 

00:02:40
NANCY I wasn't sure I would be a good parent, however one would define that. And it wasn't until I was able to process through that that I was able to say, "Yes, let's move forward with this". 

00:02:55
[music] 

00:02:55
Beginning the Process 

00:02:55
NANCY And they basically just came right out and said, "We need to let you know that we will not even consider you all as parents," and the quote was "Your chances of getting a child from us are slim to none". In the same state we traveled, you know, another 45 minutes Southwest, and we found a county that, a city that said, "Yeah, absolutely. We, you know, we work with all families, and we, we want the kids to have homes". 

00:03:20
Dan 

00:03:20
DAN We knew that our area had some very good laws protecting, um, gay and lesbian people. So we pretty much knew that if we were gonna go the kid path that we wanted to do it in our own area. We never thought about international adoptions, we never thought about going to other states. 

00:03:40
Paul 

00:03:40
PAUL We went into it thinking we were gonna do a domestic adoption, but we found that most of the agencies we were working with steered us toward, uh, international. 

00:03:50
John 

00:03:50
JOHN We had been hearing all these horror stories about how, how homophobic the foster care system was, and we did not find that at all. The foster care sy-, uh, the, the social workers were opening, opening their arms and our, and their hearts to us, saying "You are a qualified couple with a home study. We've got children that need homes". 

00:04:10
DAN We hit the jackpot in that our children's social worker, um, her niche was reaching out to gay and lesbian families. She realized even though her agency hadn't necessarily recognized this yet, that they were an untapped resource. 

00:04:20
DONNA The laws of the state that we lived in at that time, Connecticut, did not allow, um, two-parent adoption. We've always been very leery and wanted both us to adopt for legal issues. 

00:04:35
Brad 

00:04:35
BRAD I know that if for the first six months, if something had happened to me, those kids would've been sent back to where they came from instead of staying in the house, because he didn't exist. 

00:04:40
PAM My partner and I wanted to start our family openly and honestly, and we wanted it, we wanted to be able for both of us to adopt simultaneously. 

00:04:50
PAUL The social worker treated us as a couple. Uh, we, everything about it was, was equal. But you still had to go through this fiction in the, in the documentation itself. 

00:05:05
PAM There was paperwork for the dog, there was paperwork for the house, there were paperwork for each of us. And so we did it. 

00:05:10
[music] 

00:05:10
Getting the Call 

00:05:15
PAM Within a week we got a call and it's, like, um, "How does a seven pound, six ounce baby girl sound?" And we were like, "Excuse me? You mean right now, today?" 

00:05:20
DAN My children were older when they were adopted. They were seven and nine. Their social worker, when they said that they were going to meet, um, families in the future, um, and that she was gonna introduce them to a range of families. Um, and it just so happened that the first family they were gonna meet had two dads and two dogs. My son who was nine at the time replies, "Two dogs?" 

00:05:50
NANCY There was this one particular kid that we just, kind of, clicked with and we, uh, we knew that there were, there were some struggles cuz this child had been in and out of foster care. 

00:05:55
KEN They called and said there's a baby available, and, um, I called my partner James and said, "There's a baby available". And, uh, we prayed about this situation because we knew that there were issues. 

00:06:10
Noreen 

00:06:10
NOREEN The birth mother of our oldest had had another boy and was wanting us to be the parents, and i-, um, so we had first dibs. But if we didn't hurry up and make a decision, like, immediately then the-, then they would move on and find et-, uh, another group of parents. And for, so I, Nancy started talking about the pros and cons and I said, "You know what, hon? We don't have any time for pros and cons. Is there a yes inside of you?" And hear a little bit of silence and then, "Yes, there is". I said, "Good. There's a yes inside of me, so let's do it." 

00:06:45
KEN Adoption is a leap of faith and you really don't know often times wh-, what you're getting. Y-, y-, you just have to jump off that mountain and say, "I'm going to love this child". 

00:07:00
JOHN A lot of times the social workers start splitting out the sibling groups. And, in fact, when we were, when we were approached they said, "The other adoptive parents all wanted to break up the sibling group. And we thought that these kids have already been through a pretty tough road. Uh, let's keep them together. That's the only think they've got in their lives that's constant. 

00:07:15
DAN It's sad to think there's already kids that before they're, you know, 14 years old, society already wants to give up on them. And it's like they're damaged and there's no future for them. Who would want them? And that, um, we did. 

00:07:35
The Parents Club 

00:07:40
JOHN Most of the people that we talked with, mainly our families, were, uh, skeptical that two men could raise a child. 

00:07:45
Terrance 

00:07:45
TERRANCE I grew up in a, in a very religious, conservative family and so my coming out was not e-, exactly well received immediately. And initially coming out as, "OK. We're having a child. We're gonna become parents" wasn't something that either of my, my parents featured. As a matter of fact my, my sister told me later that my mom took it as a sign of the end times and, and didn't tell my dad initially that he had a grandson. Um, and it meant, but it also meant having to really become a grown up, for me, in a lot of ways. Because I had to say to my parents, "Look, this is family and this is the bottom line that you're going to have to respect if you wanna be a part of my life. Period. And the-, these, this is non- negotiable. 

00:08:40
DAN The same folks that might have had wrapping their head around this gay couple, when we were parents with kids, like, we became part of the parents club. And folks that didn't get us before, understood the same struggles, the same things. You know, how do you get your kids signed up for summer camp? What do you do when your kid wakes up in the middle of the night. Like, they just intuitively knew, it didn't matter whether you were gay or straight. Parents get that. 

00:09:10
TERRANCE Fast forward to when our youngest son was born, and I called my mom and I told her, "Well, I guess what? You're a grandmother again." And the first words out of her mouth were, "Well, you have to send me a picture. You must send me a picture," and then she said, "I wish you both all the best in raising the two of them, because the most important thing is that children have good homes and good parents". And she was talking about me. She was talking about us, and that blew me away that it could, that that could move, that people could move like that. 

00:09:45
Building Community & Staying Involved 

00:09:50
PAM Building Community has served greatly for us, because not only for us as a couple but for us as a family. 

00:09:55
NOREEN It's absolutely essential to network with other people who have, have interracial families, um, and esp-, and adoptive families. 

00:10:05
NANCY We had a support group that met on a regular basis. I was able to call and say, "I need to pick your brain on something. You know, I need your help". And you gotta be willing to say that I need your help. 

00:10:20
NANCY We rely more, I believe, as a gay couple on our friends and family and extended family to be supportive and fill in some of those roles that, um, other families might take for granted, I think. 

00:10:30
Beth 

00:10:30
BETH We spent a lot of time shopping for a synagogue where we would feel comfortable as a family. 

00:10:35
DAN When we picked schools for our kids we made certain that, that all sorts of people went to those schools. 

00:10:45
PAUL It really requires us to make a commitment to the school to make sure that he's getting the education that the s-, that, that we've gotta really, sort of, lobby on behalf of him. Sort of, you know, where we, it's, uh, uh, the school superintendent here, uh, has given me a handler because I'm emailing her so often. 

00:11:05
JOHN We make a point of talking to our kids' teachers before the first day of school and I just think that's a really good policy, I, I think, for everyone, not just cuz we're a gay couple. 

00:11:10
NANCY That's the key to stay involved. In fact, so much that I'm now, uh, the PTA president next year at his school. So I will be there a lot. 

00:11:20
Being a Conspicuous Family 

00:11:25
BETH What never ceases to amaze me is that whether it's to us or to our daughter, people feel that they have a right or they don't have the same social etiquette necessities when you're dealing with adoptive families. 

00:11:45
TERRANCE We're conspicuous when we're out together as a family. 

00:11:50
BETH And they'll say, you know, where is your daughter from? 

00:11:50
JOHN Does Joseph know that he's adopted? 

00:11:55
BETH What do you know about the, you know, the real parents? 

00:11:55
JOHN There's an Asian boy living with two gay men. What do you think? 

00:12:05
NANCY That's your mom? How, that can't be your mom. And, and just in, in how to answer that and how to deal with that. And, and he knows, you know, his answer to that is now, "There's all kinds of families. Yes, that, that can be my mom". 

00:12:15
DONNA That's your mother? And she thought maybe I was her nanny. And my daughter said, "Yeah, that's my mom. I'm adopted". And the girl moved closer to her, put her arm around her, and said "Oh, I'm so sorry for you". 

00:12:30
BRAD People would say, "Oh, it's good to see, you know, dad's taking the kids out. Where's mom today? Mom get the day off?" 

00:12:35
TERRANCE Our kids are looking at us and seeing how we respond, and that's going to inform a whole lot of things about how they respond and how they feel about their family and about being adopted. 

00:12:50
NANCY And you have to think about w-, how and what you're going to say when you're in those s-, situations. One, so it doesn't make it worse for your kid, but also so your kid knows you're willing to stand by them, stand at their side. 

00:13:00
BRAD My response is quite truthful in that mom wasn't able to take care of them. "Oh, oh." And that makes the person or stranger uncomfortable, but it helps to fend the boys that, you know, that their story's real and that they, that their dad and pop, you know, aren't ashamed of that. 

00:13:15
TERRANCE When that teaching moment arises we have to, we have to grab and we have to take it. And we have to do it in such a way that we're educating not just other people, but also the per-, little person who's standing next to us, or who's in the grocery cart. 

00:13:30
DAN I hope that we equip them with the idea that these are important questions and you're going to be faced with them over and over and over again. Um, but it's really up to you to figure out how you answer them in each situation in your life. 

00:13:45
JOHN I asked the oldest, I said, "What are you gonna do when your, when your par-, when your friends ask you, you know, where's your mom? You know, what's going on with that?" And, um, he would say, "Well, my mom I, isn't in the picture anymore". Well, who do you live with? "Well, I have two dads." Well, isn't that weird? And he said, he volunteered this, he said, "Well, actually I, kind of, feel lucky to have parents at all. I was in foster care for four years and, uh, I'm really, I'm one of the lucky ones. I got adopted". 

00:14:15
Forever Family 

00:14:20
DAN Our parenting class was wonderful. There were 10 couples. Um, half were straight, the other half were gay or lesbian. Um, and so this was new for the parenting class, but our, um, facilitators did a great job and they didn't sugar coat it. And they explained that parenting is tough and that being adoptive parents has its own issues on top of, of everything else. 

00:14:45
BRAD We did take the classes for foster care and, uh, we got certified in that. And by the time that happened, we had an adoption offered to us. And so they had gone through, uh, the grieving process and bonding issues and so forth. And that was so helpful because I don't know what we would've done without that, because when the boys came to us they had every single issue in the book they had warned us about. 

00:15:10
JOHN We were very fortunate in that we had the opportunity to meet Joseph's birth mother, and so we have pictures of him with her and with her with us, and that's up on our wall in our house. So he knows exactly who his birth mother was. 

00:15:25
NANCY With our son, I guess because he was older, he wanted to talk about it. And he wanted to share that, you know, he now has a forever family. And that was important to him. And he, he, you could, he struggled to look for ways to, kind of, identify. And with, with my personal family I have, um, mm, uh . . . I have interracial parents and, um, so he, he connected to that right away in looking at pictures of my family. 

00:15:55
DAN It's interesting that if you ask my kids, initially they would say having parents of a different race was a bigger issue than having parents, two of the same kind. 

00:16:05
NANCY I periodically will check with our children and I'll say, "So, if there was anything about this family you could change, what would it be?" And I've asked that question since they were almost able to talk. It has always been about, "It would be, I wish I had at least one of you who looked like me". It's all, the race piece has always been there. And so for me, that really said to me race is really, really important and to act as though it isn't is not doing your children a good service at all. You know, if I didn't have three African-American kids I'd be clueless about that, I'm sure. 

00:16:45
DAN I'm now at the stage where I'm parenting a 12-year-old and a 14-year-old. So we've hit the teenage years and that, um, I'm pretty much an idiot when it comes to any advice that I have for my children. 

00:16:55
NANCY Our children are two ye-, basically two years difference in age, all three of them. So it starting at 4 1/2, we had this 4 1/2 to 10 and they were into doing everything with us. They loved us. It was, we just had a ball together. On the weekends we'd go out and we'd play and, and then they became teenagers. And if you've had a teenager, one, you know what I'm talking about. If you've had more than one, it is really, really challenging. 

00:17:30
DAN I realized that the parent of every teenager goes through these same things, and that if I'm doing my job well, like, that's what he's supposed to be doing. And that if I wanna continue to do my job well, I'm gonna hang in there with him and we'll, we'll see it through. 

00:17:45
PAM You've gotta know your limitations, you've gotta know what it is you can handle. You're not in this to be Mother Theresa, you're in this to be a parent. 

00:17:55
DONNA For me, adoption is a happy, joyous occasion. Somehow my daughter had to go through a great deal of loss. Someone had to give her up and say, "I don't want ya, kid". And she has to learn to deal with that, and I don't think enough is done to help us help her learn to deal with that. 

00:18:20
NOREEN They've, you know, been taken away from their parent. They've been rejected from their parent and have then been given over to someone else, so it, it, it sucks. And so to acknowledge that, when kids are feeling their feelings, rather than pushing it off and saying, "Oh, no, those aren't valid feelings," to let the feelings in, to suffer with them when they're suffering. And then to watch how they somehow get through it and move on. 

00:18:45
TERRANCE Anything that we can do to, to just, kind of, help him feel, help them feel good about being adopted. And, and it is, is, of course, at the top, it's the top of our list, and I think it's the most important thing. I've had adults who are adopted tell me, "The most important thing that you can do is be honest with, uh, with your child about, about their adoption and how they came to be a part of your family". 

00:19:10
[music] 

00:19:10
Moving Forward 

00:19:15
JOHN Being a parent has made me a completely different person. 

00:19:15
PAUL Becoming a parent, I was never really prepared for how wonderful it was going to be. And I, and I, and, and it's not that it's easy. 

00:19:20
NANCY If you're not up for hard work you probably oughtn't not to do this. 

00:19:25
TERRANCE I'll say what, what our s-, our oldest son's birth mother said when, uh, she was telling us, telling us via her letter why she chose us for him. And she said that she chose us because being a, uh, bi-racial couple and, and being, uh, a gay couple, and these were her words, that we had overcome prejudice and discrimination and could best equip her baby, this, this African-American baby boy, to do the same. 

00:20:00
BETH Sometimes what we'll hear is, "Oh, she has so much to deal with". 

00:20:05
NOREEN They're black, you're white. 

00:20:05
BETH She was adopted. She's African-American. 

00:20:10
NOREEN You're gay. 

00:20:10
BETH You're Jewish. You know, they're basically saying to us, "Well how much more can you put on her?" 

00:20:15
NOREEN Get over it. We, we need to figure out a way to live in this world and, and, you know, I'm not, I'm ti-, I'm not gonna be apologetic anymore. It's, it's how it is and now we need to take it, wh-, whatever it is that we have and run with it. 

00:20:30
TERRANCE I would just tell people, you know, just move forward with your life. And if people see you living, living your life and being a parent and seeing you do it with love and dignity and honesty . . . eventually they're probably gonna want to come along.

00:23:20
TERRANCE One of the things that is interesting to me is that even in the most progressive households of our, of our friends, uh, that are, that are heterosexuals couples, the childcare seems to fall mostly to the women in the house. And I noticed it, I guess, because in our house there isn't that gender-based division of labor. 

00:23:40
JOHN I think in some ways a same sex couple has the advantage over a heterosexual couple, because you don't have those preconceptions that the mother does this, the father does this, but he doesn't do that. 

00:23:55
TERRANCE So when my son is walking over to the dinner table and spills these spaghetti and meatballs on the white carpet that I'm still not sure why we have it under that table, I'm gonna step in.

BRAD He's better at technology. I'm better at the lawn and the gardening. 

00:24:20
DONNA And we sit and talk about the difficult things of life. 

00:24:20
JOHN You create the rules that work. 

00:24:25
TERRANCE I like to think that seeing that balance and that discussion and that communication going on is going to help our sons in the long run. 

00:24:30
KEN For a number of reasons we elected that my home study would, um, be a single man, and my partner was not in the home study. And I think that did take a toll on us but I think we did a number of things to try and mitigate that. Um, as soon as I had an Interim Order of Adoption, I appointed my partner guardian of the child. And as soon as my Final Order of Adoption came in the mail, we made an appointment to see an attorney to do the second parent adoption. And so we tried to, I think my adoption was final in July of 2004 and my partner's was final in November of 2004. So we tried to make it a very small period of time where there was this kind of imbalance. 

00:25:20
PAUL We were lucky that we had a social worker who was very comfortable working with us. I credit her with, kind of, uh, uh, wh-, wh-, something that seems like a very simple question, but something that actually got my partner and I thinking about, something that we hadn't even, hadn't even occurred to us, which was what was our kid going to call us? You know, I mean, you know, what, like, how are you, how is this child going to distinguish between one father and another? Simple question but one that, you know, of all the things we thought about . . . you know, what color the room was going to be, were we, did we really wanna do this? What college are you gonna go to, what public . . . you know, all the, all the, those range of things, simple to important. Something as basic as our names was something that we had not thought of and she and, and it led to a really great discussion. She prompted a, a great discussion about what it meant. Why did we choose the names? Why those names? Um, does that relate to someone that, who raised you, uh, or someone that was important in your life? And does that mean, then, that that's the person you're gonna go to, turn to for inspiration or advice? So it was, it was a great discussion but one that she came prepared for that I thought, that I really appreciated. 

00:26:25
NOREEN In spite of what anybody wants to say, this is a racist society. 

00:26:30
NANCY The whole experience of transracial adoption, with our children in particular, has stretched me beyond what I had ever, I, I couldn't even had conceived it when we first made the decision to begin this journey with them. 

00:26:45
NOREEN Even when our middle girl was two or three years old and we, we were, um, given the opportunity to move up to Cayuga (ph) Heights, and everybody was telling us that it was okay to move up there even though it was white and rich and things like that, we were walking around the land looking and, and our little three year old piped up and said something about "Do you think the people up here will notice that we're a different color than them?" 

00:27:10
NANCY I mean, I know we've had challenges with vacationing. You know, and it, and I've challenged people who said, "Oh, it doesn't matter where you go on vacation". I'm like, "It absolutely does". When we go to spots where there are no African-Americans or dark-skinned people, our children notice that. They hate it, they hate the experience. So we have to, and we do, we look for places where there's gonna be a mixed population so that they feel comfortable. It's as much about their vacation as it is about ours. 

00:27:40
NOREEN I recall taking my oldest to, uh, Dominican Republic a couple of years ago, and how he just went, "Aaah," cuz he looked like everybody. And it was a, a surprise to me once again how tiring it is and how, how much it is for kids to walk in their childhood through a white world. 

00:28:05
NANCY I'm sure you remember this. Our daughter comes home from the mall one day, and she had been going up there with her friends. And she comes home and she's beside herself and she said, "I am so angry". And I said, "Well, what happened?" She said, "I got pulled out of a store today, followed out into the middle of the mall and yelled at by this woman, and accused of shoplifting". And this was not the first time this had happened to her. When she was with her group of white friends, she would be the one who would be targeted, tapped on the shoulder. Well, I just went crazy. I said, "That's it. I'm going up to the mall." I said, "Get your things, you're, let's go." And she said, "Please don't make me go with you." And I s-, and I realized that was gonna be really too hard for her and I said, "Okay, but I need to go. I need to go up and address this because this is not the first time this has happened to you, and there were a couple of messages. One is I trust you, I know you're not shoplifting." And I know this girl well enough to know that about her, and that I'm willing to stand by your side when this ugliness starts to happen. And you have to be willing to do it. If you don't have the stomach or the spine or the courage, you're gonna have to find it because you have to do that for your children. I remember when I walked into the mall, and I did this purposely, I walked in and I had a picture of her, a baseball picture because she plays basketball. And I walked in, I said, "I understand you had a problem here in the store today with two African-American girls." "Oh, yes," the woman goes on and on. Yes, and we, you know, yack and blah, blah, blah. And I said, "Oh," and I said, "Is this one of the girls?" And I showed the picture and she said "Yes, that's one of the girls". And then I said, "That dau-, that is my daughter." And I said, "If you ever, ever do that again . . ." I said "How dare you?" And I said, "That is nothing but racism what you did to these girls today. You had no basis for that and don't ever, ever do it again." I mean, her assumption was I'm not this kid's parent. I wouldn't, you know, I'm probably the police coming to investigate. Oh, I just, it just turns my stomach when that stuff happens, but then it, then you have to stop and say, "That's what my kids are experiencing day after day after day in the world that they live in".

JOHN RAIBLE You're white. Why did you wanna adopt a black kid or Asian kid or a latino kid? And there should be some, sort of, really . . . so much we, we attach so much significance to having answer that question. They can't just give us a flipping answer. 

00:33:20
UNKNOWN I used to get very angry growing up when I would look in my dad's den or my mom's bookshelf and see "How to Raise a Black Child". I'm like, why you need a manual for me that you didn't have for your other three kids? But there was in that a recognition that hey, we, we're, we're on a different track here and we can't, we don't have all the answers. So we need to look to people who have parented black children, who are black parents, to give us the answers. 

00:33:40
UNKNOWN You know, I've been forced to live here. Um, but it wasn't something that I wanted. If they had asked me as kid, "What do you want?" I would've told them, "I want to go back to my country". 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN When I see the first video, you know, it was 10 years ago. We're very different people but I wouldn't change anything that I said. 

00:34:00
UNKNOWN Even in adulthood the question lingers, where do we fit in?

The Conversation 10 Years Later 

00:34:15
JOHN RAIBLE Based on my dissertation research, I came up with this idea of transracialized identities. And there were some siblings that I talked to, white siblings, that somehow got to this new way of performing their white identity that I called transracialized. And those are the ones that did become anti-racist allies to their siblings of color, and they did t-, be-, take up the discourse of race and, and de-racism in a really principled and thoughtful, politically clear way. 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN I think a lot of the people that we talk to, and a lot of our colleagues, at moments they have been left standing by themselves and parents have not been on their side. And that is a very scary place to be, and that is where you can lead the questioning about whether they really do: A) have your back, but B) will they be with you for the long haul if there's a certain situation that's going on right now and mom and dad have disappeared and you're on your own. 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN There's this whole discourse about race, and there's this whole discourse about adoption, and transracial adoption sits right at the crossroads of that. And you have to learn about both of those, and that's a huge thing to ask parents to do. 

00:35:20
UNKNOWN We had, um, three foster care children that are siblings. And, uh, the first time I had to meet mom, dad was out of the picture, I had to go to the prison. Which for me, alone, was an experience. And I bring the kids in to meet the mom and immediately I could tell that the mom just didn't like me, you know? So I was like wow. We had, this was our first chance to work with foster care, it's our first kids. So, um, it was like, well this isn't what they taught us in the classes. We gotta build a bond here. 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN I had to convince this lady that I'm not her enemy, I'm here to help her with her child. 

00:35:55
UNKNOWN Uh, you've gotta find a common ground and, of course, this is a complete stranger. What is the common ground you have? It's the child. 

00:36:00
UNKNOWN I can remember this mom was really angry that her kid had been taken. She was furious, she was suing everyone in the state, and she met me and she was ready to kill me. The first thing I said to her was, um, "What time does she usually go to bed?" And she looked at me as if I was crazy and then she started talking to me as a mom. 

00:36:20
UNKNOWN I know I can make a difference in that one, one person can affect change. Uh, you know, and, and recognizing that that change can come from my being a part of a relationship with another individual. 

00:36:35
UNKNOWN I feel powered. I feel, um, that I'm really working to give people a voice. 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN If you can hold on to that piece of dignity that they're demonstrating to you that you will, you would, you will be able to work with them. You will be able to help them, um, and it's, it's your job as a social worker to do that. 

00:36:50
UNKNOWN I've just had so many people who've believed in me and who've been able to support me through the journey. And so whenever I have an opportunity to, um, offer any type of support or to encour-, offer encouragement to someone else, it really makes me feel . . . like I feel good to have an opportunity to give back. 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN I really do believe that I, I am blessed and blessed to be a social worker. 

00:37:20
UNKNOWN I am so happy to be a social worker. I go to work everyday happy to be there, I absolutely love going to work. My clients look for me. They see my car driving up in the driveway and it's like they're there at the door and it's like sometimes you, you have to say, okay, just give me a few minutes to just to, you know, to get myself together here. But they count of me, you know? They count on me and I know I'm making a difference. I know I'm making a difference in their lives and so that really makes me feel good.
