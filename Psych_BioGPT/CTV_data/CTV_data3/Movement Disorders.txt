Psychotropic Medications: 

00:00:05
Adverse Drug Reactions 

00:00:10
Movement Disorders 

00:00:15
SEAN HARRIGAN In the other programs in this series, we looked at various adverse drug reactions for psychotropic medications, exploring both generalized reactions common among multiple medication classes and those more specific to an individual drug or class of drugs. In this program, we'll be focusing in on a specific subset of that adverse drug reactions known as movement disorders. Movement disorders also refer to as extrapyramidal side effects or EPS are of major concern in patients receiving psychotropic medications. They most commonly occur at normal doses or after a change in medication or dose. They are much more prevalent in patients receiving first generation or a typical anti-psychotics, but are also seen with a typical anti-psychotics. If ignored or mistreated, these involuntary movements can become chronic. Some can cause physical damage or impair such things as respiration. At the very least, a chronic movement disorder can cause lifelong impairment and social situations and make employment difficult or impossible. Terms used to describe the various movements include Tardive dyskinesia, Dystonia, Bradykinesia, Akinesia, Oculogyric crisis, Akathisia, Pseudo-parkinsonism, and Paroxysms.

00:02:00
TARDIVE DYSKINESIA AND DYSTONIA 

00:02:05
[music] 

00:02:10
SEAN HARRIGAN Dyskinesia refers to difficulty initiating or performing normal movements. They may resemble ticks or it look like the patient is awkwardly dancing. When these movements occur in patients taking antipsychotic medications, it is called tardive dyskinesia. They involve strange movements of the mouth, tongue and jaw as well as curling of the fingers and toes. The patient may also experience difficulty swallowing. If not addressed in the early stages, tardive dyskinesia may not respond to treatment. If movement is abnormally slow, it is referred to as Bradykinesia and patients who quit moving all together have Akinesia. Dystonia is a subset of dyskinesia. and involves contractions of either major or focal muscle groups, causing rigidity and tension, most often in the back or neck area. The spasms can be quite painful and may last minutes, hours, or longer. Severe symptoms include extreme shaking, difficulty breathing and swallowing, choking and even bone fractures and broken teeth. Dystonia arises most often in men and in patients 25 years old or younger. Tardive dyskinesia usually occurs late in the use of the antipsychotic and maybe relieved by stopping the medication. IV diphenhydramine or other anticholinergics are often very effective in providing immediate symptomatic relief. Benzodiazepines such as diazepam and clonazepam may also be effective. However, these movements can be very persistant and often become chronic when treatment is delayed. It is important therefore that they not be confused with the abnormal behavior sometimes associated with psychosis. Patients experience tardive dyskinesia are not undermedicated, they are having a severe adverse drug reaction. 

00:04:15
OCLOGYRIC CRISIS 

00:04:20
[music] 

00:04:30
SEAN HARRIGAN A very specific Dystonia that maybe seen these patients is oclogyric crisis, also called oclogyric spasm. It is characterized by the eyes becoming fixed in a single direction usually upward. It often persist for a period of time, sometimes for several hours. And can often be confused for seizure activity. Both Dystonia and oclogyric crisis should be considered an emergency situation. 

00:05:00
AKATHISIA 

00:05:05
[music] 

00:05:10
SEAN HARRIGAN Akathisia is another movement disorder that can occur with antipsychotic medication and occurs most often in women. It manifests as strong feelings of restlessness that prevent the patient from sitting still. These individuals may pace or sit constantly jiggling a leg or changing positions in the chair. They may also sit with their legs wrapped around the chair legs in an attempt to stop the movement. This sense of inner tension can be overwhelming causing agitation and temper explosions. 

00:05:40
PSUEDO-PARKINSONISM 

00:05:45
[music] 

00:05:50
SEAN HARRIGAN Pseudo-Parkinsonian side-effects manifest in the dramatic slowing down of movements. It arises most frequently among women, the elderly and dehydrated patients. Speech maybe slurred, the posture stiff and the patient may have coarse motor tremors. Pill rolling is a common symptom as is a shuffling gate or slumped shoulders during ambulation. The facial expression is usually flat, showing no reaction to activities or surroundings. An interesting manifestation that can make it easier to diagnose Pseudo-Parkinsonism is Seborrheic dermatitis which occurs in almost all of these patients. A patient receiving anti-psychotics who develops a seborrheic dermatitis that resist treatment should be assessed for Pseudo-Parkinsonism. 

00:06:50
PAROXYSMS 

00:06:55
SEAN HARRIGAN Paroxysms are the rarest form of movement disorders and are primarily manifested in body spasms or pseudo-seizures. 

00:07:05
KRISTEN HENLEY Hey, is everything okay in there? 

00:07:10
[sil.] 

00:07:20
KRISTEN HENLEY Okay, honey? Honey? Are you okay? Okay, okay. All right. I think we need to get to the emergency room. Oh, my God. Okay. It's going to be okay. 

00:07:40
SEAN HARRIGAN Again, this can be quite painful and result in injury. 

00:07:45
NEUROLEPTIC MALIGNANT SYDROME (NMS) 

00:07:50
[music] 

00:07:55
MERLIN HUFF What's wrong? You don't look so good. 

00:07:55
ROSS CRAIN I don't feel okay. Feels a little warm. 

00:08:00
MERLIN HUFF Baby, you're burnin' up. 

00:08:05
SEAN HARRIGAN One adverse reaction worth mentioning here is neuroleptic malignant syndrome or NMS. While the symptoms of NMS can be extensive, some of the extra parameter[] side effects are among them. Though occurs rarely, NMS is one of the most dangerous psychotropic medication side-effects. It is life-threatening and occurs even if they're periodic doses. NSM is characterized by hyperthermia, Sketetal muscle rigidity, tremors and autonomic instability. Affecting such things as heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, appetite, and digestion. The patient maybe more easily agitated or show signs of altered mental status such as confusion and being emotionally labile. 

00:08:55
MERLIN HUFF you know, you don’t have to do that, you're not feeling right. Why don't you lie down? 

00:08:55
ROSS CRAIN I feel fine. 

00:09:00
MERLIN HUFF Honey, you have a high fever. I really don't make feel you… 

00:09:00
ROSS CRAIN I can do the dishes. 

00:09:05
MERLIN HUFF Okay. I, I know that you can do them and you are so good at them. Why don't you let me do them, okay? I'm really…I'll be happy to do them. 

00:09:15
ROSS CRAIN I'm happy to do them too. 

00:09:15
MERLIN HUFF Okay. 

00:09:20
SEAN HARRIGAN NMS is associated with a variety of drug that decrease dopamine receptor activity. But because it is rare, it is been difficult to establish criteria for diagnosis. 

00:09:30
ROSS CRAIN I'm not upset. Just let me do the dishes. 

00:09:30
MERLIN HUFF Honey, you are yelling. There's no need to be yelling. Are you angry? Baby? 

00:09:40
SEAN HARRIGAN There is often only 24 to 72 hours between the onset of milder symptoms and a severe reaction, so intervention must be rapid. The high fever can result in a misdiagnosis of infection delaying correct intervention. Lab results may indicate elevation of CPK or creatine phosphokinase, an enzyme that indicates organ tissue damage, decreased serum iron, increased electrolytes and dehydration. Treatment includes stopping the medication, stabilizing the patient with IV fluids and giving antipyretic such as pseudometaphen. Benzodiazepine maybe used to reduce agitation. Brain damage and death can occur if treatment is delayed. Movement disorders can be intensified by anxiety and this can lead to misunderstandings or failure to diagnose the problem. Observing a patient with abnormal movements while talking to the doctor, then seeing the same patient later sitting quietly can lead to the assumption that the patient was putting on the movement for attention or to keep from doing something he did not want to do. 

00:11:00
MERLIN HUFF Hey, are you okay? 

00:11:00
ROSS CRAIN Yeah. No. 

00:11:05
MERLIN HUFF Can you, can you talk? Can you… 

00:11:05
ROSS CRAIN Yeah. 

00:11:05
MERLIN HUFF Okay, here. I'm going to call the doctor. Stay calm. I'll be right back, okay? 

00:11:15
SEAN HARRIGAN Sorting out psychiatric symptoms from what may actually be medication side-effects can be challenging. 

00:11:20
MERLIN HUFF Hi, umm… My husband has been acting really weird today. He, he has a fever and he's been shaking and I think there's something wrong with his arms. 

00:11:30
SEAN HARRIGAN Movement disorders can resemble both the positive and negative symptoms of psychosis. So being well educated about the symptomotology and assessment of extraparametal[] side-effects is essential. 

00:11:45
ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION 

00:11:50
[music] 

00:11:55
SEAN HARRIGAN There are methods caregivers can use to assess and evaluate patients for movement disorders. Using good assessment tools is one key to preventing and managing the side-effects. One is the abnormal Involuntary Movement or AIM scale developed by the National Institute of Mental Health. It rates involuntary movements observed by the examiner on a scale of 0 to 4. Movements are assessed by region. Facial and oral, extremity and trunk. Then the patient is assessed to see if movements are specific or global in nature. The global aspect of the assessment looks at whether the patient is incapacitated by the movements and also whether or not the patient is aware of them. Having the patient concentrate on specific muscle groups during the exam allows involuntary movement s in other areas of the body to surface. One should look for lateral jaw movements, tongue thrusting, jaw clenching, any unusual movement in the fingers, limbs or facial area. Looking for abnormal tongue movements common to dyskinesia is an important part of an AIMS assessment as it's having the patient walk across the room to check for abnormal stiffness or loss of equilibrium. A tool used in the assessment of Pseudo-Parkinsonism is called the modified Simpson Angus Scale. This is a hands-on technique that evaluates the patient's range of motion while standing. A variety of assessments are done, such as tapping the patient's forehead, looking for involuntary blinking known as glabellar reflex, a sign found in both Parkinsonism and Pseudo-Parkinsonism. Observing the patient's walk is effective in evaluating gait, posture and rigidity. A third method of assessment is the Barnes Akathisia Scale, done as a brief verbal interview. First, the examiner observes the patient's behavior, looking for signs of akathisia. Next, he asks the patient questions about his own perceptions of his disorder and finally questions are asked to address how the akathisia might be affecting the patient's daily living. Using the findings of the interview, the examiner fills out the scale. Though these assessments should be conducted by trained staff, observing and documenting the signs of movement disorders is a universal responsibility. Patients with mental health problems are found on every in-patient hospital unit and in every ambulatory setting. Through increased awareness and education, caregivers help each other understand the challenges of movement disorders. Together they can work to decrease the stigma and limitations of these side-effects, increase their patient's compliance in treatment and offer an opportunity for others to live fuller healthier lives.
