MARIE L. MIVILLE This year, our famous privileging indigenous voices, hearing the wisdom of generations. And we wish to bring to the center the many diverse voices represented among indigenous people, to honor the wisdom of our ancestors, our elders, our youth, our communities. By indigenous people, I am referring to the millions of people, thousands of cultures that have lived on this earth for many millennia. Here in the America, the people known as American Indians, Native Americans and First Nations are included under this term. But as you will see this weekend of course, they're simply no word that can do justice to the people represented under this umbrella term. And now I would like to more formally introduce Narcisse Blood, Ryan Heavy Head who will be doing our, um, keynote opening speech today. Narcisse Blood, who just graciously said our opening prayer was the first coordinator of Iiyaouhkiimi studies program at Red Crow College and has been recognized as an eminent fellow by their elders advisory committee. He currently serves as the research coordinator for the Iiyaouhkiimi studies and in that capacity left the learning place animated theme bundle under the Canadian council of learning aboriginal learning knowledge center. Blood has taught for Iiyaouhkiimi studies program. The department of education at the University of Leftbridge and the international indigenous studies department, at the university of Calgary. He has served as chair of the mukokin cultural and heritage foundation of the Blood tribe and was an elected member of the Blood tribe truth and council for several terms. Narsisse Blood has principle transfer rights in the Blackfoot knowledge disciplines of the horn society and the thunder pipe bundle. Ryan Heavy Head is coordinator of the Iiyaouhkiimi studies program and I apologies if I’m not saying that right, Ryan taught me how to say it, but I hope I remember. At Red Crow College, where he teaches Blackfoot specific undergraduates courses. He also works as a researcher on projects ongoing with the Iiyaouhkiimi studies program, am I saying that -- 

00:03:40
 Yep. 

00:03:40
MARIE L. MIVILLE Okay. Heavy Head came to Red Crow with a decade long background in Blackfoot repatriation negotiations. He has also worked on repatriation contracts for the Hopa tribe of California and the Confederated tribes of Grand Ronday in Oregon. He holds a bachelor degree in anthropology from the University of Massachusetts, a masters degree in cultural anthropology from the University of Leftbridge and principle transfer rights in Blackfoot knowledge discipline of the Beaver bundle. Ryan Heavy Head is committed to the development of ecosocial -- ecosocial science, anchoring in the Blackfoot knowledge paradigm and is grateful for the many elders and advisors who continue to assist him in this pursuit. Please, I'd like to welcome Narcisse Blood and Ryan Heavy Head. 

00:04:35
NARCISSE BLOOD By way of intro, uh, usually I push Ryan to go up first, but since I got my sheet wet a little bit with the opening prayer, I feel brave enough to do that. I just wanna acknowledge the fact that, uh, we have bonded with New York City, because, uh, my work and working with Ryan, one of the things that we did was repatriate some of our ceremonial items from the American museum of the, uh, the American Indian. And, uh, with me is my wife, uh, Elby Mountain Horse and our son Joey Blood that are here with me. And, uh, and my -- my other, other niece isn’t here, uh, Justine, she'll be joining us, uh, Ryan's daughter, uh, will be joining us hopefully soon. But we got to meet, uh, Gabrielle Hamilton, who is here with us. Uh, she works for the, uh -- uh, institute or, um, traditional dance and music, uh, and she was really helpful when she was working, to bring some of those ceremonial items back. And we were just here recently couple of years ago to do a play dealing with historical trauma of high school students and middle school students on a play of -- of, uh, a massacre, the hands of US Calgary in, uh, January twenty-third of 1817. So we have a lot of bonding, uh, with New York, uh, city and so it's -- it’s always nice to come and visit. And I was just telling somebody, I think I can really enjoy New York, the way I do because I know I'm leaving. There’s too many people here, especially where we're from. But I just wanna say that this work was really started by Ryan and it’s a story that we're going to tell and it was, uh, an application for research, where the research question changed a little bit, at least for me and Ryan had enough, um, thought given to what we're going to share with you. And changing the question that really challenged me, because anything that has ever been written about us, the Blackfoot, uh, I react to it. Especially the earlier writings of Clark Whistler, who is a very important person in anthropology and set a tone that we're still fighting. Uh, he did not, those of you that are doing graduate work, you have to defend whatever you do, whether it’s your PHD, your dissertation or your Masters thesis. You have to defend it for somebody and when he did his work, he didn't have any peers that had the qualifications that -- that he had to defend it to. But it set a motion. So whenever I read those, I would always react. How could they get away with this stuff? This is crazy, you know. First of all, they didn't know the language and Clark Whistler was in our territory for only three weeks and then. And then -- so that was usually the way I operated. And then Ryan comes along and changes that and I think it's a much healthier, when he asked the question for the research that we applied for. What is the influence? What is the Blackfoot influence on western thought? I mean, it took me out of my comfort, discomfort zone of always reacting, okay? It changed it, the dynamics of that and our first case study was Abraham Maslow. And we'll share that with you, it's an untold story. And it is that, a story. We're gonna – we are gonna share it with you, the best way we can in the Blackfoot tradition. And that is through a story. I also want to just at this time acknowledge Dr. Joseph Trimble, who is here with us. We met Dr. Trimble in Akron, Ohio and we met him that one time. But he was such a, uh -- uh, had such an impact on me, his wisdom and his approach to research and that time we spent with him in Akron. And since then, we've just been trying to find each other,. And it's nice, to come back to Columbia University, where a lot of the story takes place. So thank you Dr. Trimble for the work that you've done. And certainly the promoting of the work that we've been doing, I'm – I’m really grateful for that. And, uh, Dr., uh, Caroline Barkus, who is uh, bekani(ph), biscotti bekania(ph), she invited us to, uh, to the University of Utah, to present to the, uh -- to the, uh, Indian Association of, uh, physiologists. If I’m getting that wrong, I apologize. But its really good to see you, Caroline, wherever you are, uh, because that was quite, uh, quite – quite the experience and it's always nice to meet fellow, uh, Black Food. And, uh -- and doctor Joe Hill, uh, we were in Australia together. And Ryan was explaining to me, when we were down there, I was telling him, why am I getting this headache while I’m in Australia? And he explained to me, it's because we're upside down and your blood is just. So with that, uh, I'll have Ryan begin the story that, uh, starts, uh, out west and over to Brooklyn College and of course, Columbia University. 

00:10:45
RYAN HEAVY HEAD Okay. 

00:10:45
RYAN HEAVY HEAD  [non-english narration] 

00:10:55
RYAN HEAVY HEAD I'm Ryan Heavy Head, um, as Narcisse explained, we're from Red Crow College, the kani(ph) studies department and what we do at kani studies, I -- I coordinate the, uh, program. Narcisse was the original coordinator and then moved into the, uh, research coordination position. And what we're working on is developing, uh, undergraduates and hopefully one day, graduate programs that operate, um, completely out of netesetopus scatucksin(ph). It’s the Blackfoot knowledge paradigm. And one of the things that we're up against in doing that is, um, the perception that Blackfoot, uh -- our way of life doesn’t have a knowledge paradigm, so much as it has a culture. A lot of times when we go to different universities to teach as part of their, uh, programs, they refer to our courses as the -- as the, uh, the cultural component. And it diminishes a little bit of what -- what we have to offer, uh, quite a bit. Um, so in 2004, we decided, well we need to do some work to, uh, spread the word that we have more to offer than a cultural component. So we hit up the social sciences and humanity research council of Canada, uh, for a graph and they've never given a graph to a college, nonetheless, an indigenous college. Uh, but they -- they had a new program coming online, uh, aboriginal research program and they -- and they gave us, one of their key awards in that program. And we ran with it and our -- our study was called, snicksees(ph), which refers to stories. Um, we were trying to kind of combat the plummets of morality and literacy to begin with. But one of the ways that we decided to go about this was to look at certain stories and look at those, um, scholars, western scholars that had come into Blackfoot communities, uh, either doing their dissertation or thesis studies or post doc, or what have you. 

00:13:15
Naamitapiikoan Missed-Placed: 

00:13:15
A Blackfoot Response to Maslow’s 

00:13:15
Kippaitapiiyssinnoon-Derived Theories 

00:13:15
RYAN HEAVY HEAD Um, and one of the stories that we'd heard just a shadow about, was, uh, pertaining to Abraham Maslow. Um, what we had heard was that, for his hierarchy of needs derived from, uh, an interpretation of Blackfoot tee-pee designs. Painted lodges like these ones here. And that was about the whole of the story that we had really heard. Um, a -- a fellow named John Many Chiefs was working at -- as a councilor at a – um, at an addictions counseling center on our reserve. And, uh, he had been -- he had been using Maslow's hierarchy of needs in his counseling services and referring to this as the Blackfoot model. Um, he worked with Gerolic Catfrob, who is doing the same. And so they knew that there was something there and --and uh, a lot of people knew that there was some connection to Maslow. Um, and his hierarchy and his lodge designs and such. But we wanted to flesh out that story because we figured, well, if that’s -- if that’s the case, then we can follow this story, that’s a huge impact because everybody's been affected by Abraham Maslow. Um, our -- you know, in – in western society, family life changed because of Abraham, Maslow. Education changed, business changed, management and of course, psychology. So we decided we’d follow up on that and we went to Siksika and talked to people and, uh, we went to the archives of the history of American psychology in Akron and pulled everything we could that might be related from Maslow’s papers, um, his journals and his published work and unpublished works and – and we found one of his co-researchers, this was 1938, that he ended up going to, um, Siksika, which is the northern Blackfoot reserve. And we found a, uh -- um, Jane Richardson Hanks, who was turning a 100, the year that we were doing the research. And she was still lucid and coherent and remembered the -- you know, her memory of this time very well and shared that with us. So we got little pieces from the story from all over the place and we pretty much have a whole story. Um, but there's still a few gaps here and there and we found that, the story was much more than that shadow that we'd originally heard. So that’s what we're gonna share with you today. And we can start many places, telling this story, but it makes sense to start here. At Columbia, um, in the mid 1930s, Maslow came to New York City and, uh, he had just, done his PHD studies, uh, in Wisconsin. Finished his --finished his doctorate. Came to New York and he really wanted to work at Columbia because Columbia is where the who’s who of American academia was in the 30s. Um, people that he – he, uh, studied and admired, uh a lot of them worked here. But he, -- he was unable to secure employment here, so he went to Brooklyn college and he worked in the psychology department there. But he made his way over to Columbia as much as he could, he tried to get into the circles of the scholars that he had read he was interested in. One of them was Ruth Benedict. And at the time, um, Ruth was hosting a colloquial and of course Ruth Benedict was the head of anthropology department here and, um, she had taken over from France Boaz and so she's kind of a first generation anthropologist -- cultural anthropologist. She was hosting a colloquia here, uh, bringing in chief players from various disciplines to look at western society and address problems that they saw in western society and how they can bring all their different knowledge, traditions together and try to -- try to fix issues. Um, so Maslow attended several of her lectures and -- and, uh -- uh, talked to her enough that he got invited into the circle. Which is exactly what he wanted to do. One of the questions that they were looking at was, um, how can we eliminate some of this competitiveness of western society? Um, how can we get rid of what Maslow would later call this, um- uh, this, uh, kind of jungle approach the, uh, the survival of the fittest, uh, kind of appreciation of what western society -- of what society is, hey? And Maslow walked into this, into this, um, colloquia and he said, we can't. We can't get rid of that. 

00:18:40
Prior Influences 

00:18:40
RYAN HEAVY HEAD Now, he came into that context with, um -- with his own background and training and study and such. He worked under Harry Harlow to get his dissertation or his PhD. And of course, um, Harry Harlow, famous nature versus nurture, uh, primate studies. And, when Maslow worked with him, um, he studied -- well he wrote a couple of papers that -- that got him some recognition. The first one he wrote was about salient appetite and, uh, everybody here probably knows what that is. I normally explain it to -- pretty thoroughly. But basically, he said when you -- when you have a, uh -- any of these primates, when you feed them the regular diet day after day after day after day, they get to where they just eat enough to be full and then they'll leave it alone. But after they've left it alone, if you introduce something new, a treat, something they haven't had before, suddenly they're hungry again. Um, this he called the salient appetite. And you can see how that might play later into his hierarchy of needs. The other thing that he wrote about, that got him even more recognition was, uh, the dominance and submission relationships that they had. He said that all of these, all of these, um, primates have social orders, hierarchies that they put into place and keep in place through this dominances and submission relationships. Basically the biggest rapists are on the top of this social hierarchy, um, and those that, uh, don’t stand up to them are lower. And you get down to, um, very submissive, um, apes and monkey that have been -- been, um, raped and abused by these other ones for so – so long that they -- they just hide. They won't even look at them in the face. So when he went to New York -- when he came to New York, he decided well I gotta test this out on people. What I'm seeing with all of these different primates and see if this happens among people. So he developed a social personality – or social personality index, I think it’s called. Still used today. Somebody tell if – if I've got that wrong. But, um, what it was was a questionnaire, two part questionnaire and the first part of the questionnaire, um, asked leading questions, um, to the effect that the responses that he got, he could -- he could see whether somebody had a – a secure ego, whether they were a little bit insecure. Um, questions about how they felt about themselves in relationship to other people in their lives and such. And then the second part of the questionnaire, um, went into very deeply into their personal, uh, sexual life. And he administered this questionnaire on, uh, college students here at Columbia. Um, started off with men and women and then quickly shifted to -- mostly to just women. Um, he thought that the -- the men were -- were telling him a lot of stories. And he -- and he just admitted that at one point that he rather enjoyed interviewing the women. And what he found was that, um, there was a correlation, the same thing that he'd seen in the primates, he thought. Which was that people that rated themselves in a way that he knew they were pretty, uh, ego secure. Also had really experimental sexual lives and people that rated themselves in a way that they seemed rather insecure also had, um – uh, very reserved, uh, personal lives. 

00:22:40
Ruth’s Colloquia 

00:22:40
”Now, more than ever, we 

00:22:40
need data on the 

00:22:40
consequences for human life 

00:22:40
of different human social 

00:22:40
inventions. We need to know 

00:22:40
how different inventions 

00:22:40
have worked – inventions like 

00:22:40
the absolute state, or 

00:22:40
inventions like wars for 

00:22:40
conquests, or inventions like 

00:22:40
money. We have no longer 

00:22:40
the normative faith that 

00:22:40
social problems can be solved 

00:22:40
by a philosophical appeal to 

00:22:40
the eternal values. Eternal 

00:22:40
values themselves are 

00:22:40
suspects.” 

00:22:40
RYAN HEAVY HEAD Um, so when he went into Ruth Benedict’s colloquia this is what he carried with him. And when they said, how do we get rid of the competitive nature of western society. He said, well you can’t. Um, because this is something that happens in all primate societies, human societies included. And that is that um, we create social hierarchies through competition, through aggression, um, and submission relationships. And so this is just part of our nature. And, uh, you might as well not – not worry about trying to change it. And Ruth Benedict uh, as a – as an anthropologist said, well, young Maslow before you go positing this as a – as a universal thing maybe you should step into another cultural context. Step into somebody else’s life, uh, for a little while. And see if what you – what you’ve, uh, learned in western society holds in this other context. And Maslow had read a lot of cultural anthropology. But he’d never, um, had any real training cross cultural research. So he said, um, I’m not really equipped to do that. And so Ruth decided to assign him one of her, uh, new PhDs, uh, Jane Richardson to go to Siksika, uh, with him. And show him the ropes. And there’s a reason why she chose Siksika, the northern Blackfoot community in particular as a place to send him. So I’ll let -- Narcisse if you want to talk about that. 

00:24:30
NARCISSE BLOOD Right in the early 1900s the Blackfoot people had after they make treaty with the, um, British. We have some of our people that, uh, we teased that got caught on this side of the line. And, you know, we pray for them a lot. No, just kidding. Um, they were looking at the three Blackfoot tribes on what is now Canada. The Blackfoot speaking tribes are the – the Siksika that Maslow went to. The northern uh, Itcaniya(ph), or uh – uh, bacshibicanyane(ph). Imscopic picanyane where Carolyn is from, uh, is a – they’re now in Montana. And, uh, well I better stop there because I don’t want to get into politics here. No. And of course the Bloods. But what they were studying, what Ruth Benedict was studying was the three Blackfoot speaking tribes in Canada. After a very aggressive campaign of Canada trying to downsize the reserves that were given to us after the treaty in 1877 that we made with the British. And the Blackfoot speaking people – uh, and this is where our connection with the Sioux is in 1876 the Canadian authorities were very aware that the Sioux had sent word up to us to join forces. To fight against the US army. And in 1876 you have, what Custard -- Custard and that whole, uh – well, that – that whole story. And – so the Canadian government really rushed to make treaty with the Canadian Blackfoot. And if they didn’t have to they would have just usurped the land. But the Blackfoot were still a force to contended with in 1877. So they gave us these reservations that were oh, much larger than other tribes in Canada. So, after – after we were subdued more with – with the destruction of the Buffon. We’ll come back to that later. And also the effects of small pox that dwindle our tribes tremendously. That they came back and they said, well, after thinking about it, we gave you too much land. You know, the fact they gave us land. So they started downsizing the reserves through illegal votes. And, uh, we don’t have a copy of this but, uh, we’ll – uh a good, uh, John Tobias who’s an anthropologist published Our Betrayed War. Or the Indian agent Aaron Wilson describes and documents it very well what happened. The techniques that were used to downsize the reserve. This was at the turn of the century the outbreak of Work War I when all of this is taking place. So we jump ahead to 1938. She wants to find out how did we do. How have we coped with this very aggressive downsizing of the reserves. And that’s when he sends out Maslow and researchers that were sent to the north Pegan. I think you had Oscar Lewis there. Uh, and then, uh – uh, Esther Goldfrank with the Blood tribe. And you have Jane – Jane Richardson – Jane Hanks at that time, uh, coming out to Siksika. And, uh, Maslow is asked to join her.

00:28:20
NARCISSE BLOOD Okay. Now, he is sent out – he is sent out – you remember he’s a hotshot. He’s got this universal that he’s finding out. You know through this research. And of course it doesn’t sit well with the likes of, uh, Ruth Benedict and others. Because remember they had a very very genuine concern. Ryan is being very kind when he says the aggression, eh. The – it’s the selfishness. It’s the aggressive behavior that she did not like because of her work and working with other non-western societies at that time. Remember in 1938 – well even in 19 – in 2011 US is still a very very young country by our standards as Blackfoot people. And Canada as well. So, a – a country is emerging, eh, to become what is now the US. And she does not like this aggression that’s going on. This selfishness. To what we have today as what capitalism. And – so, he send this young hotshot researcher. You know and – and you can understand why she would be upset with that. And he comes out to our land Kitaowahsinnoon. Kitaowahsinnoon is the Blackfoot word of how we see the land. And this is where I want to make a point about our ways being described as spiritual. Okay, they are spiritual, all right. But, let’s not end there. Spiritual is an English word. This is my second language. It just doesn’t cut it. It just touches a little bit about who we are. When we use the word spiritual in English it has connotations or conjures up thoughts of religion and belief. And our ways are much much more than that. So I just want to say that on the onset. Not that it isn’t spiritual. But it just one aspect of who we are. So he comes out here. And we’ve had many researchers that – you know, this story still happens today. He comes out to our territory.

00:32:45
NARCISSE BLOOD Do you think Maslow knew this. Ayo Naatoyiitapiiksi. Our ancestors, the sacred beings, eh. This is who we call upon. What is our view. What – how do we see the world. As Ryan said if we’re just pushed off merely to the cultural component you miss everything. And it is – as I try and use these big words in England—or in English I say paradigm, no. It’s a paradigm.

Kitaokakio’satohpinnaan 

00:33:25
NARCISSE BLOOD Kitaokakio’satohpinnaan This is below our house. There is so much happening. There’s trails all sorts of animals. There’s plants that we can use. And Kitaokakio’satohpinnaan really means in this really improvised translation into the English language is that you have to be wisely aware of everything around you. You have to embody that knowledge. Of not just what you see but what you don’t see. What you hear and what you don’t hear. All right. And this really goes against the whole notion of western – western academic thinking, eh. They would say zero in on something. Get specific. If that’s the way we look the world I wouldn’t be standing here today. And it serves it purpose, all right. Obviously you know, my wife is doing her PhD. And that is an ongoing um, discussion with her supervisors. That she has to zero in on something and get very specific and ask the right questions. It just does not work like that. And what are the implications for that today. If you’re just zeroing in on specific things and not being aware of everything around you. So there’s a lot going on here.

NARCISSE BLOOD Now, in our world – and it’s not just our world. But I’m going to talk about what I know best. And that is in our world we talk about Kitayiisooksspinnaan The land, Kitayiisooksspinnaan, sustain us, all right. What is our relationship to the land. These are saskatoons of one of many, many berries that we use and roots, eh. But we have this because Ryan took a nice picture of it. Saskatoons a good year, eh. But you feed us. You feed us. This is also below our place. We swim there. We used to be able to drink from this water. We can’t any more. We used to use that all the time, the Blackfoot. And I’m sure other tribes that we couldn’t’ drink directly from this. Kitayiisooksspinnaan you give us water. You quench our thirst. 

00:36:00
Kitaopiinomooksspinnaan 

00:36:00
NARCISSE BLOOD Kitaopiinomooksspinnaan This is just one plant. This is sage. There’s many many plants. My wife has – has a website where she taught her students about these plants. You know, so that we don’t lose our language. And what do those plants mean. Ryan has this wonderful quarts. Now and then I studies for students have to go out and reestablish our relationship with these plants. My son Joey is part of that. Now just the plants but those animals. Who were they to us, eh. If I just said they were spiritual relations, no. What did the animals give us. And what are we doing today when we can justify the destruction of species. There’s consequences to this. Because remember, in our entire existence – last year at this time we’re at Stonehenge, eh. The Blackfoot predate that. the Blackfoot predate Christianity. The Blackfoot predate the great Pyramids. What was it that we had this long continuum of existence. What sustained us. It was the land. That was more than enough. It’s still like that today. And we’ll get to that you know, in our grand finale.

NARCISSE BLOOD  Kito’totama’pssihpoaa. This is Chief Mountain. Of Caroline always – she – she – her – her ranch, her -- her – is not too far from them. But this mountain is very important. The whole landscape, well Blackfoot territory is very important. This is where Thunder lived, eh. Anything that can hurt us, we try and have a relationship with, eh. One of the stupidities of human beings today is thinking that the technology that we have today is going to protect from those elements out there in – in the environment. What just happened here a few weeks ago. Snow, snow, and all sorts of snow. I’m glad it’s not snowing today. But we measure our years Kito’totama’pssihpoaa. When we ask how old are you we ask Kito’totama’pssihpoaa. How many winters have you accomplished, eh. Because our whole preparation is that we make it through winter, eh. Even in our technological world winter is still a dangerous time of the year.

Ainna’kootsiiyo’p. What is wrong of respecting those things that give us life. Eh. I can’t help but get political. I wish the Tea Party could answer that question. They’re scary. We have them in Montana too. 

00:39:30
Kitaoksisawaatohpinnaan 

00:39:30
RYAN HEAVY HEAD So, Kitaoksisawaatohpinnaan. We visit places, this is talking just concepts. Talking about visiting. And much of what in these, uh, concepts we’re going through many of them Narcisse spoke in his prayer this morning. And this is the point, eh. Um, that this is not just prayer and spiritual but this is something – this is a whole – this is some of the key concepts we work with every day in knowledge tradition. So we visit. And I didn’t quite get this myself, um, until we did a – we did a, uh, class with Guana studies where we started going to atapiska(ph), living place, scared places. And we brought, um – uh, we brought, um, food that we fed these places. And, um, we sat and visited with them. And only then did it really dawn on me that visiting in English is nothing like uh, kitaoksisawaatohpinnaan, to visit in Blackfoot. Because in English if I said I’m going to go visit New York. That means something totally different. It’s not approaching it as a living place. And I start looking at, um, places where there’s interpretive centers around historical sites and this kind of a thing. And it’s – it’s, uh – it’s a whole different paradigm. It’s kind of a death complex. It’s looking at it like, um, a respected elder that’s passed away. So what do you do, you try to preserve the body. If you want to learn from it, you do an autopsy. In – in the Blackfoot world it’s completely different, eh. They’re approached as – as living.

Aatsimihka’ssin 

00:41:15
RYAN HEAVY HEAD Aatsimihka’ssin Making amends. Um, we went to – Narcisse and I were invited to Montreal. Al Gore came up there and – and, uh, was hosting a workshop. And they just selected speakers from across Canada. And we were one of these invites. There’s – there was maybe 150 of us there. And they talked all about climate -- the climate crisis and solutions to the climate crisis. And the whole time um, you know, we hear was it’s still a linear kind of one way relationship. Eh. Take and take less. And this concept doesn’t play into it at all. Aatsimihka’ssin. What are you going to do to fix relationships when you’ve – when you’ve crossed the boundaries, when you’ve broken protocols. When you’ve taken from something, what are you going to give back, eh. Um, making amends. And this is – this is Narcisse up on, um Kitaoisissa(ph). Sweet pine hills in it’s now in northern Montana. And this is all from the (inaudible ). But this -- the offering is much more than what, you know, people say –it’s saying offering is almost like saying that spiritual. Um, but it’s much more, eh. When you don’t even own our bodies and in the western system we don’t even give them back. We don’t want to give those back either. Nothing.

Ruth’s Children Experience 

00:43:00
An Awkward Entry 

00:43:00
RYAN HEAVY HEAD  So this is just a little fragment of Blackfoot world for you. Um, and how much did Abraham Maslow and how much did, uh, Jane Richardson – and they had another colleague, Lucian Hanks that came with them. How – how much did the researchers – were they going to be able to appreciate even that little fragment of Blackfoot’s reality of the kind of concepts that we deal with every day at home. Um, in the six weeks they were going ot spend at Siksika. How -- how prepared were they to enter into this world. And really get to know it in a way that they could come out and say anything that would – that would, uh, be valid. Um, Maslow and Jane were assigned by Ruth to – to go to Siksika. And Jane didn’t much care for the assignment. Um, because she had been interviewed by Maslow in his social personality index. And she’d walked out half way through the interview. But she agreed because it was Ruth Benedict. If Ruth Benedict asked you to do something you do it. Neither one of them had a transportation to get them to Siksika. There was no way for them to get up there. Um, neither one had a car. But Maslow had a friend in Wisconsin, Lucian Hanks, that he’d gone to school with. And (inaudible ). So they got a hold of Lucian and they said, well how would you like to come up to Alberta and, uh, do some studies of, you know, deviants and such. Out on – out on this Blackfoot reservation. And Lucian agreed. So they met in Wisconsin. The three of them. And they got in their car and went up to Siksika. And they – there was no prior advance notice that they were coming to Siksika. Um, they carried with them a letter of introduction from Ruth Benedict. And they went and they drove in. And they drove to the, um, Indian Agent, who was Agent Pothington that year. And they gave him this letter. And told him what they were about. And they – we’d like to do a research project here. And surprising enough for 1938, Pothington told them, um, I can’t give you that permission. I can’t – I can’t tell you whether or not you can stay on the reserve and do this study. You need to talk to the – the elders, the leaders of the community. What I can do for you is I can assign an interpreter. So he assigned Earl, um – uh, oh man. Oh yeah, Calf Child, Earl Calf Child and told him well you’ll – you’ll work for these guys. You’ll interpret for them. So Calf Child brought the three researchers to go, um, meet the elders. And what was happening at the time was they were just getting ready for the sun dance, agogatsin(ph). Which is the biggest, kind of ceremonial, uh, event of the year in midsummer. And, uh, a whole uh, number of ceremonies take place there. And so everybody was getting set up. Everybody was camping at the site. And, uh, and he brought him down there. And brought him to the, uh, lodge of White Headed Chief. Who is one of the leaders at that time. And it just so happened that in White Headed Chief’s lodge there was a number of the people that they needed to speak to right there. They were meeting on another issue. And, uh, they walked in. And Earl introduced them and -- and uh, told the elders that they were going to speak about this project they wanted to do. And so, at this point Jane tells us, well, Earl introduced us. And, um, they were expected us to say something but the boys totally, uh, were overwhelmed by what was happening. Um, they weren’t ready to be in that situation at all. They were completely intimidated and they lost their tongue and they just stood there. They couldn’t say a thing. And so there was an awkward moment. And Jane said finally she had to get up and say something. So she told them well, we’ve come here. We’re very interested in – in your – your life and your history. And we want to record your memories of, um, how life has been here. And, um – uh, your stories. The things you want to tell us we’ll – we’ll write them down. And they’ll be saved for future generations. And any questions we’re asking, everything that we’re doing you’re always going to know. We’re not here to do anything secret at all. Uh, we just have a – a high respect for um, Blackfoot people. And so the elders head this. And Jane said then the boys after she spoke, um, the boys got their tongue back and said some nice things. And, then the – White Headed Chief uh, confirmed with – with his – with the others. And then he addressed them and said, that he would host the researchers. Um, they could stay. But they couldn’t get their research carried on right away because it was ceremony time. So, what they would do is, uh, get a canvas tent and they could camp next to his lodge at the ceremony. And just enjoy the time at the ceremony. After the ceremony they could get started with their research. And he would host them. They could stay – stay at his place. So they agreed. And the researchers went out and started, uh, getting themselves camped.

Presenting Tongues 

00:48:50
Mrs. Many Guns Hoots Okaan 

00:48:50
RYAN HEAVY HEAD One of the things that they read about. They’d read Clark Whistler’s, um, material and such before they came out. And – so Jane knew that there’s in the Sun Dance ceremony there’s a – there’s a woman, Okaah who has – who fasts for four days. No food, no water for four days. And, um, that this leading in to kind of the climax of the ceremony. She’s sacred. And she feeds the whole encampment buffalo tongue. She needs 100 tongue. Um, that she dries and then cooks and then feeds the people. People makes vows with those tongues. And she knew that from what she’d read it’s a – you know, it’s a good thing for somebody to do as a – as a – um, as a gesture, um, to bring tongues to this woman. Because she has so many she has to collect. So they asked White Headed Chief, uh, the – the holy woman, can we bring her tongues. If we can – if we’re able to get tongues can we bring them to her and give them to her as a gift. And – and she said he was taken aback that – to even hear the question. Because he had no idea how – how she might know about that. Anyway, um, but he said yeah. Uh, definitely you can – you can give her tongues. That would be very nice. So they went to the butcher in Gleshing. And they said, do you have any – any tongues. And the butcher said, well we’re all out of tongues. But, I can get some shipped in from Calgary. So if you come back tomorrow, I’ll get some on the train. They’ll be here in -- and I’ll have tongues for you. So the next day they went back to the butcher in Gleshing and they said, you know, our tongues. So, they had three tongues. One for each researcher to bring to the -- to the woman. They went back to the camp. Went to White Headed Chief and they said, we’ve got our tongues. And he said, well you can’t just walk out there. I’ll take – I’ll take you out there. And he gave them a Hudson’s bay blackest and he showed the – brought them out there.

RYAN HEAVY HEAD And they presented their tongues to the Okaan. And she painted their faces and she prayed for them. And when they walked out of the oguyas(ph), her lodge where she fasts. And when they walked out, as Jane remembers it she said, the whole camp it seemed like everybody was outside of their lodges. They were all – all eyes were on us. Everybody was watching us. And everybody had a – had a look, um, but first they -- couldn’t believe that, you know, these white people had come out and – and done this. Um, that they knew, you know, something to do. But she said, I think this is where we gained their trust. I think this is where we gained their real permission to carry out the research that we were going to carry out. This is Jane’s memory. So we – when we went to Siksika, and we were asking about this story. First of all, at Siksika they remember everybody that was in that lodge. Um, when White Headed Chief first met the researchers. They named everybody in there. A lot of the people in there were – were current bundle holders at the time. People who were taking care of – of uh, sacred bundles. And they told us that, um, contrary to what – what the story Jane had told us the elders had an intentions of their own. They had intentionality. Believe it or now. Um, what they had done after the researchers went to go set up their camp, right away, these are the people that are taking care of the bundles today. But, they have their own elders too. Taking care of the bundles – when you’re taking care of bundle it’s like you’re in graduate school. Eh. So that’s your training time. You have elders that are guiding you and teaching you in how to take care of those bundles. And – and how to work with them. And so once the researchers went on their way to go set up their camp, right away they sent out a messenger, um, to get a couple of their elders. Ohupotas(ph) Fat Horse is one of them. Uh, Frank Tries to Fly was – they went to go get him. And they brought them in and they asked them well, these – these guys are here. They want to record our stories. They want to write them down. They – they said they’re going to be preserved for future generations. What – you know, should we tell them anything. What should we tell them. And what they said, was that, um, they wanted them to tell everything to the researchers that they knew about tobacco planting. Tobacco planting was – is another whole ceremonial complex. Um, almost as big as the Sun Dance, the ceremony for tobacco planting. But in the Bloods, where we’re from, um, tobacco planting by 1938 was gone. And itpikani(ph) and amskapipikani(ph) the other two Blackfoot tribes, it was gone. The only place that was still doing it in 1938 was Siksika. And they knew probably their time would come. So this is what the elders advised. Well, in the future, you know, our – our descendants are going to want to know how to do this. Because it’s going. So, let’s tell the researchers everything that we know about tobacco planting. So when you go to the Glenbow Institute and you can do this on-line. Glenbow Institute, um, go to their archives in Calgary. And you look at Jane uh – Jane and Lucian and Hank’s, uh, materials they have all of their – all of their little steno notebooks there. And everything – all their field notes. And probably 80 percent of that material is the tobacco planting. It’s all very detailed, step by step how you do the ceremony, what’s the origins of it, what’s the songs you use. What does it mean. What’s the order, you know. Um, exactly what the elders had advised them to do. Um, veer off into some other stories. But, sometimes, uh, closely related. So, this is why Siksika participated. They had something that they were worried about losing. And they wanted to, uh, capture it. So they were using the – using the researchers for their purposes. 

00:55:25
Sun Dance Research 

00:55:25
RYAN HEAVY HEAD Now they were told, don’t – don’t start your project while you’re at the ceremony. Um, but, you know, of course they’re looking. They started their field notes anyway. And one of the first things that the researchers looked at was the teepee designs. Of course you know, you come into a whole camp full of these painted lodges. And as an outsiders this is something, you know – you know, you’d be curious about right away. So they talked to the owners of these different lodges. They drew a little in their notebooks. They draw a little – little, uh, diagrams of the encampment and which lodge is where and how’s it painted. They drew pictures of each lodge. And Jane took photographs of each lodge. And she told me that she gave – one of – she made two, uh – uh, she processed and made two photograph – two images of each photograph she took. She gave one to the owners, to the families of those lodges. Um, the other ones she kept for their studies. Later on after they got home Maslow asked if he could borrow those images. And so she sent him the whole stack that she had taken. And she never got them back. And in fact, in, um, one of the, uh, papers that we found in Akron Ohio is unpublished paper color Blackfoot psychology, by Abraham Maslow. And Jane was one of the reviewers, um, of that paper. And in her notes in the margins, so where’s my photographs. She said that you returned them. Never gave them back. Um, and we haven’t been able to find them. This is one of the – this is one of the, um, missing pieces of the story. Where did these photographs go. We think maybe they went to a Dr. Fisher who is at Calgary who, uh, later close to Maslow’s end was communicating him – with him about the relationship between um, synergy and, uh, what he had – what he had gotten involved in Siksika. 

00:57:25
Sun Dance Research 

00:57:25
RYAN HEAVY HEAD So that’s the first thing they focused on was the lodges. Um, the next thing, and Maslow writes about this quite a bit actually. Is that they witnessed things at the sun dance that – that he couldn’t make sense of. Uh, one of the things that he – he writes about is what we would think is – is a transfer. He said it was a giveaway. So this man came to – came out and he brought everything, all his worldly possessions, everything that he can amass in the time of a year. And, all kinds of things. He made a big pile of all of these possessions that he had. And then he spoke about himself. And he talks about, you know, everybody knows me. You know, what a great guy I am. What I’ve accomplished in my life. Such and such. And when he was done speaking he gave all of that stuff away. Now what we suspect is-- is what he was doing was he was – that was a payment for him to transfer to get another way of life transferred to him. In other words to take on a bundle, to take care of it. But – but he gave it all away. And Maslow said he walked of with just the shirt on his back. And, he couldn’t make sense of this. He imagined himself, you know, what if I go out and in New York City and I bring everything I own and everything I can amass in a year. And I make a big pile of it and I talk myself up and then I just give it away and walk off with the shirt on my back. Well, basically then I’m just a homeless bum, right. There’s no social reward.

Follies of the Psychiatric Interview 

00:58:55
Margaret Crowfoot and Annie Royal 

00:58:55
RYAN HEAVY HEAD So what’s going on here. So this – that – that, uh, what he witnessed stuck with him. And when the Sun Dance ends they get going with their researcher. And Jane is told that the elders one thing and the elders have their intentions. And Maslow is there wanting to do his social personality index with people at Siksika. And he – you know, he starts going around asking. Jane advised him and Lucian for that matter. This is what, you know, Ruth sent me out here to show you guys the ropes. So what we need to do is during the day you – you boys will go off and you’ll sit with, uh – with the important elders of the community. And ask them questions about Blackfoot way of life. And everything that they tell you you write it down. I’m going to go sit off with the important woman and do the same. And in the evenings we’ll come together and we’ll share what we’ve – what we’ve heard that day. And, um, Maslow said no, no, no. I’m here to do this – this study. So he started asking people, trying – trying to do the – the social personality index with them. And he was getting stonewalled, of course. They didn’t – you know, right way, well do you – you know, feel you’re a better person than so and so. Or who’s the – you know, who’s the biggest liar around here. And such and such. Nobody wanted talk bad about each other. Um, and he ended up just as he did here at Columbia turning to young women. And, you know, maybe his best source of – of getting – getting the uh, index off the ground. But word got back to the elders really quick about what was going on. And Jane, she later ended up marry Lucian. This is, um, Lucian on the left and Maslow on the right. And um, I think in part because of what happened here she ended up marrying Lucian. And, um, she sent me all of her – what she had left, um, of their papers from that time. And some of them were letters back and forth with – with their families. Um, from when they were in Alberta. And in one of Lucian’s letter it’s very revealing. Because he said the interpreter came to talk with us today and he said the elders are really upset about the questions that you guys are asking. And if you continue to ask those questions you can get the hell out. You know. And so, um, he said I guess I won’t be able to study deviants. I guess I’ll have to – have to do something else. Maslow kept going. And the tension got so high that Lucian and Jane decided we need to pull away from this guy or we are going to be kicked off of the reserve. So, they went back to Agent Polington and they asked him, you know, do you have a cabin, do you have some place we can stay. We don’t want to be, you know, we – we need some place else. And they pulled away from Abraham Maslow. And they started just – just as Jane had advised doing their field notes and recording the tobacco planting as the elders had intended. Maslow continued to do his thing.

Self Esteem Dominance 

01:02:20
”With respect to self 

01:02:20
esteem, it was found 

01:02:20
that a completely 

01:02:20
different quality of 

01:02:20
self esteem was found 

01:02:20
in about 80-90% of 

01:02:20
the Blackfoot tribe, a 

01:02:20
quality that is found in 

01:02:20
only about 5-10% of 

01:02:20
our population.” 

01:02:20
RYAN HEAVY HEAD He was stonewalled. Um, but he was making observations. And from what he saw and this is part of his – part of his unpublished paper. So there’s something very different going on at Siksika. Um, he couldn’t explain it. What was happening here. The – the whole society it seemed or 80 to 90 percent of the people at Siksika had this kind of quality of, uh, ego security, self esteem that is only in maybe five percent of western society. And that particular quality of self esteem ego security they don’t put others down. Um, they don’t – they don’t, uh, put others down to get where they are. To feel that way about themselves. What is he talking about here. Anyone. This is self actualization. What he witnessed at Siksika becomes kind of his model of self actualization. Um, that kind of – that kind of security where you don’t have to have this competition and putting other people down to feel good about yourself. So he starts looking around. How do I explain this. How does the whole society have this – this is totally different than what he witnessed in primates and college students here at Columbian. What’s going on. 

01:03:55
Child-Rearing Observations 

01:03:55
”The Blackfoot Indians 

01:03:55
are strong characters, 

01:03:55
self-respecting men… 

01:03:55
They were tough characters…If you 

01:03:55
watched to see how 

01:03:55
they developed this, I 

01:03:55
think it was through 

01:03:55
greater respect for their 

01:03:55
children.” 

01:03:55
RYAN HEAVY HEAD One of his ideas was that maybe it came from a different way of child rearing. And he writes about two different examples. He’s – there’s – there’s one boy about maybe 10 years old. Um, in Blackfoot we call him a minipulka(ph), kind of a favorite child. Uh, literally a berry child. But, um, a favorite child. And he’s taking care of a bundle. This minipulka. And the man comes to visit him. And ask him to transfer that bundle to him. Um, and the boy said, come back in four days and I’ll have an answer for you. So he sent the man away. The man went away and then the boy got his blanket and walked out into the coolie, and didn’t return for four days. Came back and he told that man, yes I’ll – I’ll transfer it to you. So he’d gone – what he’d done is he went out into the coolie and he fasted for four days and waited for you know, how he should respond to come to him. And to Maslow this blew his mind. This is a 10 year old boy. First of all, he has a social responsibility to take care of something that’s, you know, very important, cultural patrimony. Uh, for the whole of Blackfoot society. And he makes the – he makes the calls on that. Not only that, but, you know, when – when he has a decision to make he goes off into the wilderness, you know, the river coolies and fasts for four days. And his – his dad’s okay with that. That’s strange, right. What’s going on here. Um, a different kind of responsibility. The other – the other example he gives, he says there’s a young boy maybe three years old. Um, Maslow is visiting this family in this little cabin. And the young was trying to get out of the door. There’s just a one room cabin. He was fiddling with the door trying to get out. And, um, he wasn’t able to open the door. He was getting frustrated. Starting to get, you know – starting to kind of, uh, get upset. And Maslow’s first instant was I should jump up and open the door for this – this kid. But he noticed that nobody else seemed to be paying attention to him. Nobody else seemed to be – so, you know, he was very thoughtful. He sat and he waited, he watched and observed. And what happened was the boy eventually opened the door. And when he opened the door, suddenly everybody was praising him. Oh, he got a door open. Man you’re smart and. Everybody gave the boy good high praises. And then Maslow light bulb went off. Oh, you know, something – something – my instinct was to jump up and open the door. But maybe that’s because I don’t have much respect for this kid. I’m just thinking he’s going to fall to pieces. And I’m going to get up and take care of it before he starts burst out crying. Um, but these people seem to have more respect for him.

Child-Rearing Observations 

01:06:55
”The Blackfoot Indians 

01:06:55
are strong characters, 

01:06:55
self-respecting men… 

01:06:55
They were tough characters…If you 

01:06:55
watched to see how 

01:06:55
they developed this, I 

01:06:55
think it was through 

01:06:55
greater respect for their 

01:06:55
children.” 

01:06:55
RYAN HEAVY HEAD And so in his child rearing observations what it basically comes to conclude is that Siksika, um, people respect children as full social members, full human beings. And they’re treated as such. And this makes a big difference on um, their – their psychological constitution as adults. Maybe this plays into that kind of ego security that they have that he later calls self actualization.

Blackfoot Altruism (Kimmapiiyipitssini) 

01:07:25
Teddy Yellow Fly 

01:07:25
RYAN HEAVY HEAD Another thing that he noticed, and this goes along with that, um, give away at the Sun Dance. He said there is – there is a kind of altruism going on here that, uh, you know, he wasn’t familiar with. Um, something that we might call, uh, Kimmapiiyipitssini in Blackfoot. But, that’s a really complex concept in itself. We can take a day talking about what that means. Some of the examples Maslow gives, um, he got to be friends with Teddy Yellow Fly. And Teddy was a young charismatic leader of the community at that time. Um, he often represented the tribe back in Ottawa. And uh, they wanted to meet this Teddy Yellow Fly. And so Teddy invited them to the – to his place. They went over to Teddy’s place. And when the researchers arrived, they sat down at the table and they started talking about their project. And Teddy said, gitka(ph), I have something for you. He went in a – in a back room and he came out he had a book. It was Ruth Benedict’s patterns of Culture. You should read this I think it’ll help you with your studies. Oh my god, these people read too. He made an impression on him. But the bigger thing was that Teddy Yellow Fly was the only man, the only person in Siksika who had a car, who owned a car. He had the one car in Siksika in 1938. And what it meant to own a car in Siksika meant that you bought the car and you had to pay and take care of its maintenance. But everybody gets to enjoy your car. If somebody needs to go somewhere they come and ask you for the keys or you’re driving them. So Teddy’s car was all over the place. And the whole community had pride in Teddy’s car. And Maslow was watching this all play out and he was just amazed at the – at the generosity of this guy. And – but then one day there was a big social event going on. And Teddy Yellow Fly came out there and he just announced, you know, in three days I’m going to be castrating and branding my calves. And that’s about all that he said. And that day came and there was several young guys there to help him take – take care of the work. They weren’t there as a job to be employed or anything like that. They were just there to help Teddy out because he needed help. And so another light bulb goes off in Maslow’s head. Oh, something – these guys are very generous. But at the same time they’re totally taking car that anytime they need help it’s there. Um, so this was another thing that he wrote quite a bit about. And it – I think it played on his mind.

NARCISSE BLOOD In this presentation we’ve learned so much about every presentation that we’ve made. We’ve met people, it’s been very learning for us. And one of the places that, uh, we presented was at the University of Montana in Missoula. And one of the people in the audience was a personal friend of Maslow. And she didn’t like the way we were depicting the story, the untold story. And she said, you know, you got to remember that Maslow uh, was Jewish. And that his family had to, uh, escape from eastern Europe as a young child. So he – he said, you guys need to understand that. That he knows oppression. And one of the things too that made a lot of sense when we heard that is, he noticed that the people, the merchants in the town of Cloney and Gleshing, that bordered Siksika, the people in those two communities he noticed didn’t treat the people from Siksika very well. They were rather ignorant. And I’m refusing to use the – our word, no. Um, that – they -- they were ignorant and rather racist. That they didn’t appreciate the business that they were getting. And they were on their land.

NARCISSE BLOOD And – so he asked these elders what do you make. What is your take on the treatment that they have for you. And they said, yeah, we’re aware. We’re very aware of the way they treat us. And, you know, we don’t like it. But you know what, there is something wrong with them. There is something incomplete about them that they have to treat us that way. And you know what, that is not our problem. That’s their problem. And Maslow was just blown away. He said, my god, those are my exact thoughts. And these people have no formal training. And they’re capable of psychoanalysis. And this is another jump off point. That we want to explore. That we’ve got work to do here. Because racism is hatred. And it makes us less as a person. And sometimes and unfortunately I am a survivor of residential school or boarding schools. We start losing touch with who we are. And one of the unfortunate consequences is we start forgetting who we are. As people. Because our goal as Blackfoot is to become a person, a well rounded person. That makes a lot of mistakes too. That’s wonderful, eh. I went to a residential school and Christianity was forced upon me. Especially the Catholic faith. And it wasn’t a very pleasant experience for me. Those of you that are Catholic remember the Baltimore Acadisim, eh. It’s very punishing. At least my memory of it. Hell wasn’t scare out of me, it was scared into me, you know. It is a foreign concept. And in my journeys over the years it’s been very freeing for me to break away from that. And be involved. And I’m not saying that –I wouldn’t say that Christianity is better than Blackfoot ways. But the Blackfoot ways are best for me. And I think that is the ultimate in respect to Christianity. Is that I will practice who I am. Because Christianity is not who I am. But I can – and having said that, then I can respect it a lot better. So, when we go down that road of colonizing, being colonized, and the state of neo-colonialism one of the unfortunate things that used to go down this road of racism it is an ugly road. It doesn’t matter who you are. It’s – it’s, like, I’m going to recover from alcoholism, eh. Alcoholism doesn’t discriminate. And in a very warped way I guess anybody can be a racist too. And I try and warn my students that you are not a complete person when you harbor hatred. That is what racism is. So, when he heard this. It’s not that we’re ideal. The reason I brought up Christianity was in our ways it’s okay to make a mistake, eh. It’s just from being human. We have not be stories that tell us that we are going to make mistakes, eh. And it’s okay. You know, as a grade three student being brought up in that – you know, we had religious studies. And that if you made a mistake it was a sin. Maybe it was the way it was taught to us. But it wasn’t a very pleasant. So when we look at this we can start a whole thing about how we saw the newcomers. It’s not new. We already started psychoanalyzing the people that we coming. And can you imagine what we said about that. Especially when the buffalo was destroyed. What are these people doing. What are they doing. Do they know there’s consequences to that? That is very recent. That is in my grandfather’s time, eh. So this is an important part, not just in the form of sharing with you. But reminding our people, my own people, my own students, that racism is ugly. It is a form of violence especially towards you. When you harbor those kinds of thoughts. So Maslow was really take aback by this. And that person that we met really gave us a better insight to who Maslow was. Because he was very observant having had to escape persecution from eastern Europe for being Jewish. 

01:17:20
RYAN HEAVY HEAD This is a picture of, uh, Jane Hanks, the year that we were talking to her. She was turning 100. This was taken on her 100 birthday. And this is her son Peter, um, who also – he works at MIT. And he was – he was, uh, talking to us as well. He went to the Siksika when he was very young. Um, Lucian and Jane, they ended up getting married right after, uh – uh, this experience at Siksika. And they had two boys. And they brought them both to Siksika to get Blackfoot names, to get Blackfoot identities. Because while they were there with Maslow they had gotten Blackfoot names. And Jane’s name was Iesumyaki. And what this means – what this, uh, come from is a story that Mrs. White Headed Chief had that name transferred to her. And it came from a woman who was out – she was out picking cactus berries with some other women, uh, in the prairie. And they saw the enemy coming. And she said, you know, you women go back to camp and get the men. I’m going to stay here and distract these guys. So she waited there. And, uh, the enemy came to her. And then the other women were able to get the men there in time to root the enemy. And so her name – that’s the name that was given, Iesumyaki, the ambush woman. That went to Jane. Her son’s got really nice Blackfoot names with nice stories. I mean these – these stories are given so that you live up to them, eh. So you grow with them. Uh, in your identity and sometimes you change your name in the course of your lifetime. So – but Maslow his name was Nomitapiko. Nomitapiko, and in his writing he said I think that means the chief of the northern people. He didn’t remember anything about what was told to him. Probably because they didn’t tell him. Because Nomitapiko means, there’s a guy from the south east. You could see that just from the name itself that, um, Siksika -- people at Siksika didn’t have, uh, really a lot of respect for Abraham Maslow. Um, he ended up – he went there, you know, intent on studying different kinds of diverts and such and it – and applying his social personality index. And he ended up becoming the deviant of Siksika. But, his experience there in the – the woman that Narcisse mentioned that we met in Montana, she said that she knew, uh, Maslow a good part of her life. Her husband was, um, a psychologist and she was a – uh, she was an editor for one of the journals. I can’t remember which journal she said. But, anyway she – they were friends with –with Maslow. She said, he never talked about this. He never talked about any of this until one of the last times I saw him. We went out to dinner. My husband was already passed away by that time. And, um, Maslow and I went out to dinner. And he told me all about this. And she said, you know, the story you guys are telling is accurate. Um, but what he told me was this experience shoot me to my knees. He had totally not expected what he encountered at Siksika. He – remember he came in after training with Harry Harlow. He was a science guy. Had a scientific method. By the books. He came out of this experience and right away turned that around. So from now I’m going to be an intuitive learner. Going to be an intuitive learner. Came out of that summer, went home here to New York, to Brooklyn College. And one of the first things he did, his wife had had a – had their first baby while he was gone, their daughter. And, um, they lived in a big apartment complex and he said, well, you know, the way we live is not going – he went to a – each of his neighbors, knocked on their door and said, you know, we’ve just had our first – first child. And I – I’ve seen something I want to try to establish, more of a kind of a family atmosphere here. So, my door is open to your children. They can come and go as they please. They can sleep over. They can raid my fridge. I’m going to treat them just like I would my children and love them. And I hope you do the same for my daughter. And it never played out. But this was the experiment he had in mind. He was that impressed by what happened at Siksika. The other thing he did immediately was he started the first class on moral human psychology, ever. Because he realized we’ve been studying illness all this time. But we’ve never had a base line of health. And so for him, um, his base line was basically what he saw at Siksika. That this is – this is a healthy society that produces healthy people. And something’s going on. So he started studying that. And he – he has a series of notebooks called the good human being notebooks. Where he tried to find that five to 10 percent of western society that had the same kind of psychological characteristics as the people that he saw at Siksika. And he studied their – their biographies. Tried to learn about their lives and what did they all have in common. What did – what’s lead them, um, to get to where they are. Uh, the – to get to that place that he later calls self actualization. So he was so impressed he immediately changed the field of psychology basically. And, um, immediately changed his own life. Tried to make changes in his own life. Tried to bring into a microcosm what he’d seen in a -- in a whole society. And he played with that for a number of years. Um, I think it was four or five years before he really published, uh, that – that model, the Hierarchy of Needs. And he was building up to it through this good human being notebooks. So, the hierarchy of needs, did it come from Blackfoot teepee designs. I asked Jane directly the question. What do you think about his hierarchy of needs. Do you think that came from his studies of the teepee designs you guys did at the Sun Dance. And, you know, he – he stole the photos, right. And she said, I don’t know. She said – she said, uh, Maslow, he was really out of his element. He – he didn’t know much about doing cross cultural research. I don’t know if he even paid attention to the teepee designs. And I don’t know if he ever wrote anything um, that was – that was very important. She said, but he – but he wasn’t, um, you know he didn’t – he didn’t lack observation skills. And maybe that later in his – in his, you know, grinding the whole experience through his mind, playing with it. Because he – he made observations. I mean, he was aware of his surroundings. Maybe – maybe it did. But I don’t know she says. So we don’t know either. I mean, we’ve got no definitive answer from Maslow. We’ve got no definitive answer from the – you know, the – some of his friends that we’ve met. Uh, or Jane. Um, it’s – it’s pretty probable. Uh, we know some of it comes from his experiences with salient appetite. Some of this idea that you get, you know, you got a base level of needs and then inter – you need – you know, there’s other higher things that you’ll go for even when you’re not hungry. Um, but you could very easily interpret the teepee designs in this kind of a format. In this kind of format. Because they do start with very physical, um, physical – uh, those – those circles you see at the bottom are called katatatosi. Katatatosi means stars. But it also means puff ball mushrooms. And puff ball mushrooms are used as punks to carry fire from one camp to another when you’re moving. So it’s a real important need. Especially like Narcisse was saying in the cold, in the winter, you need that fire right away for your family. So you have of those so that your – you know, your family’s always protected that very base need for heat. Um, other designs have other things down there. There’s always those primary kind of things. In the middle you have a – you have whatever transfer view that design. Often times it come in a dream and there’s a spirit or animal that gave that design originally. Um, but in that, um, there is protection there is safety needs, there’s belonging needs. Because being transferred you enter into a whole line of people that have transferred that design. And you become part of their family. Like a when – when my wife and I took on the beaver bundle. Um, our elders are like our parents. And their elders were like our grandparents. And you get a whole another kinship line by entering into transfer. And of course there’s – there’s social responsibility and social prestige associated with it. All of these kind of social things in the middle of this hierarchy of needs. You can – you can see that in teepee designs. The self actualization, I don’t know because we have the night sky up there. Some of the things that Narcisse talked about. Sun, moon and morning star and the constellations and such. So we don’t know if the designs came from there or not. But it’s – it’s possible. What we do know is that self actualization you know, his prototype for what that is comes from Siksika. Comes from his experience there. We’re almost out of time, eh. I’ll just click through really quick. But synergy is another thing, um, in his organizational psychology later in his career this is where he starts dealing with, um, that kind of altruism, uh, that he saw in – in the cases like Teddy Yellow Fly that he writes about. Um, and he – he used that model, he started working as a – um, as a consultant for different businesses, different corporations uh, trying to change their business practices to be more synergistic. Based on the kind of things that he’d seen in Siksika society. So he changed businesses well. And since we don’t have too much time I won’t’ go into detail. But this is another place where we think he made a major impact on western society. Um, and it – it derived from him being compelled to understand something that he saw at Siksika. That – that became his base line for his studies in that area.

RYAN HEAVY HEAD In conclusion, what was the thing that he missed. We titled this -- I’ll give you a clue. We want to title the – the paper and hopefully the documentary that we do Maslow as – you know, it’s a pun. Misplaced. He was misplaced when he went out there. But what else did he miss. He missed placed completely why would these people have what they have in his eyes to be self actualized. And it was the place that they lived in. This was the place of their ancestor. They were anchored in place. And knowing the land intimately and having a relationship with the land was what he missed. And it make sense that he would miss it. Because he was transient, eh. What was his homeland. I know where my final resting place is going to be. It’s going to be on my home land, my ancestors. When you know you’re going to – when you know your – your family, your neighbors, your community, that you’re going to grow up with them. Not too many people can relate to that. Because in Canada and the US, we live in a very transient world. We don’t get to know place. Our students have great difficulty answering the assignment question where is here. It’s a question that Wendell Berry wrote, asks, where is here. Students have problems with that. So he misplaced completely. If we had more time we would go into that even more. So on behalf of akayukaki(ph), Ryan and I thank you for listening to our presentation.
