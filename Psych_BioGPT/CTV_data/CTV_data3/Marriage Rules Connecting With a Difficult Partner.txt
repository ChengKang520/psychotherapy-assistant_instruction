JEFFREY ZEIG I unabashedly love Harriet. She has been a stellar performer and wonderful friend of the Erickson Foundation for many many years and recently keynoted our brief therapy conference and comes back to keynote the Couples Conference will also be on the faculty for the evolution of psychotherapy conference. So we rely very heavily on Harriet as one of the important voices about women, about women in therapy and also certainly about marriages. Harriet has written 11 books its really broach the distance between speaking directly to professionals and speaking about importantly to the public and so I think that you’re in for quite a treat. I know that I have her recent book Marriage Rules. I have it in my waiting room, so that my patients can be looking at that when they are waiting. So please a very warm welcome joining me in a very warm welcome for Harriet Lerner.

HARRIET LERNER Thank you, Jeffrey for inviting me back yet again and for all the amazing work you do in the world. Jeffery is tireless, and tireless and travelling all around the world. I think going to Russia next week something like that. So my subject is connecting with difficult partner nearly every person who seeks our help is married to a difficult partner, perhaps every person the exception being my husband is married to a really difficult partner. Not that it starts out that way. A French proverb reminds us that all beginnings are lovely. And most people enter marriage full of optimism and hope and fully expecting to be a fair and responsible mate. I was remained of how much wisdom and how much good intentions couple start out with as I listen to the marriage vows of the young couple that they said out loud to each other in front of their community of family and friends. They said in turn, I promise to always treat you with kindness and respect, I promise to be faithful, honest and fair. I promise to listen carefully to what you are saying. I promise to apologize when I’m wrong and to repair any harm that I’ve done. I promise to cook and clean for you. That’s my actually my favorite, people think it doesn’t belong, but they are wrong. I promise to be your partner and best friend in the best and worst of times. I promise to bring my best self into our relationship. And I promise to live these promises as a daily practice. Really need the experts say more. By the time, many when reaches our office however the stage of blissful togetherness is over. Now two people may be angrily polarized around the very differences that they found exciting or initially fail to notice excuse and two people may have fallen into silence or they’ve caught up in endless cycles of fighting, blaming and complaining that lead to no constructive resolution. As they attempt to get through to their partner and set things right, people confuse their emotional reactivity with having a voice sharing real feelings or speaking their own truths. Conflict only brings pain, rather than being away for two people to know each other and themselves better. I always remind my clients, I remind people whenever I speak that even the best relationships will get stuck in too much intensity or too much distance and pain. Our automatic tendency to fight fly is hardwired and marriage is a lightening rod that absorbs intensity and anxiety from every source past, present, unconscious, conscious. When anxiety and underground intensity are high enough and last long enough even the most mature relationship will begin to look like the most dysfunctional one. So I love them, in America the novelist, she has the best definition of a dysfunctional family, which is any family with more than one person it. So I justify, I define a dysfunctional marriage is any marriage with more than one person in it. And I use the term marriage broadly here to include all couples who are committed to staying together over time gay couples, lesbian couples, heterosexual couples. I actually want to begin by telling, actually I have already began, but I again begin by telling you a little bit about my parents marriage, which will illustrate some points including my passion for helping people to find their voice and to speak wisely and well with the most difficult people and in the most difficult circumstances. And talking about my parent’s marriage is also going to lay the groundwork for a briefcase presentation. So throughout my parent’s very long marriage, my father Archie was the accommodating partner and my mother Rose made all the decisions. She decided how many would be managed and spend what would hang on the walls, how much sister and I would be reared, what allowance my father would get and everything else. I never heard my father protest at the face of it he was completely satisfied with this arrangement. More than anything else, my father hated a fight. He hated conflict and he would leave the room if he saw it coming and I never in my life heard him raise his voice, but it wasn’t just conflict, and fighting that Archie avoided. He avoided any clear statement of self and any statement that would bring marital differences out in the open. Instead my father would say nothing, he would accommodate on the surface and then secretly do what he pleased. When I asked him, why he never spoke up to my mother, because I was always trying even as a small child to get him to speak up because I hadn’t learnt that you can’t change your parents. So I would like to be on his back and he would always, one of the things he would say simply is quote, it's not worth a fight. Just not worth a fight. Now no one who knew my mother Rose would have describe to personality as bossy, domineering or controlling. She simply wasn’t that type. She was modest, self-spoken, warm, a quiet and careful listener. And despite Rose’s towering competence she preferred to be in the background a quiet and careful listener and appreciative audience to others. And no one who knew my father, ever would have described him as quite or lacking in voice. It was my father who love to pontificate and hold the court. A charming and woody storyteller he was the talker in social situations. But my father who was so good with words was also terrified of them. And another thing that he would say what now I would encourage him to express himself as he would say quote, words spoken can never be taken back. But daddy I would protest even as a little kid, I would protest of course words can be taken back. Not that we can swallow our words back down our throat. I could cartoon running in reverse, but I couldn’t grasp the logic of this gratitude that my father lived by until we’re now in the staff and then later in my career I began studying Bowen Family Systems Theory and with much resistance I put together a genogram of my own family. I put it down in paper, it took years, getting through my own resistance to get it on one piece of paper. So my grandparents on both sides were Russian, Jewish immigrants. But the trauma of the immigration was handled very differently on my mother side than on my father side. On my mother side the togetherness for us was very powerful and in the new family, family members they clone together with the belief that family is everything and all you need. But there were only cutoffs on Archie’s side. Anyone who got mad would disconnect from a relationship as if they had gone back across the ocean to Russia never to return. Differences were not tolerated. So if you fought with a family member that person might never forgive you or speak to you again or recognize your existence. Archie watched his big sister, my aunt Annie fight with their mother and become literally and irreparably estranged. If my aunt Annie and her mother they live together somewhere in L.A, they’d pass on the street, they did not recognize each others existence. Archie’s mother did not recognize the existence of one person in her family of origin. And my aunt Annie, my father’s big sister refused to speak to me or my sister for over 30 years up until her death. And obviously not after her death either. Long distance call. So in the background of the severed relationships that occurred in the new country was a history of profound grief and loss in the old country that was never mentioned or a processed. So considering what my father observed in his first family, no wonder he believe to quote, words spoken can never be taken back. Now Archie and his mother refused at the hit. He was her loyal son and I think the degree of fusion was fueled by the cutoffs, he was the only person that my grandmother was connected to, it was my father. And it was Archie’s job to wave his mother’s banner. And be her strong ally against his father and his parent’s brief marriage, which did not go well or last long. Archie had no recollection of ever saying no to his own mother. He couldn’t even recall ever saying to her you know mother I see it differently. You know let me tell you how I see it. Now when my father married, the plot beginned Rose my mother who had her pleasure disposition and got a long role with everybody and hated, she hated Archie’s mother. She blamed her for ruining Archie’s character for spoiling him and for being impossibly controlling and ever bearing. As the tension mounted between the two most important women in Archie’s life, he was at a total loss to navigate his part in the triangle. His mother would say send money, Rose would say we’re not sending money, we don’t have enough for the family. His mother would say, you have to move to L.A. to help with my business, my mother would say we’re not leaving Brooklyn. Archie who could not speak up to even one woman in the simplest of circumstances was caught in a loyalty struggle that paralyzed him. In the midst of this intense triangle he was unable to clarify where he stood, what he believed and the idea of alienating either his mother or his wife was intolerable to him of course and he felt, I imagine that he had to chose between them, he quote, solved the problem by saying yes to both through at least by not saying no. And then my father acted out in ways that were not appropriate on his or above board and in this way I believe he eroded and eventually destroyed his own self respect. Now my father like all human beings was much better and more complex that no worse things he ever did. Every human is better and more complex than the worse things they do. However it's my belief that the worse things my father ever did was well connected to his inability to define himself to speak, to be heard and then the shame that men have about that kind of silence because you know men are supposed to be an authority and speak. So I’ve shared this with you to make several points. One is that the challenge of finding voice is not just a women’s issue. It's an equal opportunity employer. And I have to say that in my 40 plus years of clinical experience, it is my observation that this is more a problem for men. That speaking out and having a voice in a couple relationship is more a problem for men. And second, I shared the story about my parents because I want to illustrate how very important can be together a clear multi generational genogram or perspective that will influence your partners ability to use their voice and to navigate in adult couple relationship. And third I wanted to illustrate a point in systems thinking that the triangle not the diet is the basic unit of human functioning and that every couple you see or individual you see their couple relationship will be caught in many interlocking triangles and broadening that concept to modern times where divorce and remarriage are normal meaning normative events. The loyalty issues and interlocking triangles of step families are built into the system. And/or I must inherently very difficult. So although it's not my topic to talk about remarried families or step families I included a chapter in the handouts that I wrote. I'm working with remarried couples when there are step kids in the picture I really encourage you to read it. And hand it out, how many of you by the way actually print out the handouts? Very few, okay. I really encourage you to read it because if you attempt, if we attempt to treat a couple in a step family based on the treatment model that we’ve learnt for the original nuclear family we will not be successful. What never changes in family triangles is that the negative intensity usually lands between the women. Say for example in my family the negative intensity was between my mother and her mother in-law. Or in a step family the negative intensity most likely you’re going to see it for example between dad’s adolescent daughter his new wife, the step mother and the daughter’s mother. And the experience of the man might be if only these women would get along everything would be okay. So I just want to tell you that I take it as a law of physics that when they naked of intensity lands between the women, that when it's played out between two women there is a man in the picture, their husband or father who is in a distancing position. And he is at a lost to speak up to the key women and the key players and you know it's funny what I’ve been thinking about lately is, because I think therapies often tend to see the problem as the women because that’s where the intensity is being played out, is think about, I often think about this dreadful time honored fairytales, which are all so awful you know to read to little girls I mean like all of them even I use to think that worse one was Little Red Riding Hood, who even Little Red Riding Hood, who lack the intellectual resource from this to distinguish her own grandmother from a wolf in a night-cap and had to be rescued by the male hunter who cut up in the belly of the wolf and you know and then the moral of the story is to never stray off the convention of path et cetera, et cetera I mean they are all dreadful. But Hansel and Gretel given sort of what we are talking about now, is a really interesting one, if you think about it, because you know I don’t even remember the details that well, but basically there is a wicked stepmother right and there is not enough food to go around. So she tells her husband that child’s father that he has to send his kids out to die because there is not enough food to go along. Well of course the father doesn’t want to do this, but she is so insistent and so difficult that what can a poor guy do, but send his kids out to die. So off he sends them to die, but then they meet the other you know the wicked women witching they come back and somehow the stepmother is out of the picture and the dad is like you know then they lived happily ever after and people read this story I think therapist too, without getting it, that the stepmother has five minutes of history. You know with little kids, and the father it's his sacred responsibility to protect those children. So it's a very interesting story because I think when kids read it, you know who do they blame and who do they see, as the good guy. So with that introduction I want to talk about a man that I saw in therapy, this might be the first time that I recall in decades talking about a male client and because usually I talk about women. And of course it's really all connected. So this is the man I’ll call Jack. And I want to illustrate three key challenges in dealing with the difficult partner and a difficult triangle. And these challenges transcend gender and they transcend any filter through which we see reality their key challenge is for any of us, who want to relate successfully with another human being. So I want to invite you as you listen to my talk today to think about one thing that you might do differently with a difficult person in your life. It doesn’t need to be in a couple relationship. I more and more a believer that it is not until one does something differently changes ones position in a relationship that one can actually see that relationship. And so these three key challenges, which of course sound simple, but are the work of at least one life time are one the challenge of pure listening of wholehearted listening. That is listening with the intention only to understand and without defensiveness. And then two, the challenge of differentiation of self, to be able to define who one is, this is what I think, this is what I feel, these are the things I will and will not do, which includes taking a bottom line position very difficult in marriage a position, which is not negotiable under relationship pressures. And three the simple challenge of observing and changing one’s own part in tough relationship patterns. In both the couple relationship and in family of origin relationships from a systems perspective navigating family of origin relationships and finding ones voice is one of the Royal roads to having a better couple relationship. So Jack came to see me in his late 30s because he was depressed not that he use that word mostly depressed since his father’s death a few years earlier and basically came because his doctor his physician told to he might be a good person for him to see. But when he came he was not focused on his dad’s death nor on his depression, he was desperate and he was desperate because his wife Judy and his widowed mother Lorraine did not get along. Lorraine who lived out of town, but like four hours in driving distance would visit them in Kansas City and she would hit the ground running with criticisms of Judy or just loads and loads of little what she thought of his corrections or advice giving as well as ignoring when Judy would say something like don’t bring electronic games for the kids she would come with electronic games and so forth. And after a particularly bad visit, things have reached a fever pitch and in response Judy told Jack that she had enough and that his mother could never visit again. That she could never come again. Now Jack rose tied up in knots, he couldn’t imagine telling his mother that she had to stay away. And he was afraid that if his mother came in business continued as usual that his marriage might not survive. And the conversations with Judy about this did not go well and Judy was basically saying it's her or me. And by the way if this isn’t clear it was Jack I was seeing in therapy and I very often because of how I work prefer to have one person in my consulting room. Even if I invite the other one in, briefly the person who either is in the most pain or the person who has their motive running for change and of course that’s up in the same person because the person who is in pain is helping the person with their motor running for change. So to make a long story short I want to emphasize or illustrate those three key challenges I mentioned earlier that Jack made working with me with both his wife and his mother. And making these changes not only improved his marriage, but also raised Jack’s level of maturity or differentiation of self and self regard and actually ultimately helped him to move forward in grieving his father. So the first challenge for Jack was that of wholehearted listening. You know as we all know really listening is the greatest gift that one person can give to their partner. People enter into marriage with such a strong longing that their partner will get them, that their partner will really be there for them. And listening is key, it's just key to that. Now Jack thought he listened to Judy, in fact, he thought he over listened to her. But as I asked him questions to sort of track the interactional sequence of how the conversation went, it was clear that he was listening to Judy for about one minute or a nanosecond and then he would you know become defensive, he would try to explain his mother or he would under react which led Judy to overreact and he -- he also when Judy become very intense and she had a very intense sort of rat-a-tat style, he would then begin to distance and stone walk and sing up a tune in his head when she was talking about his mother. He had this -- he'd watched a Seinfeld show, where -- what's was the tune that one of them sang in their head and couldn't get out of their head, it was that tune, I can't remember what it was. Anyway, I suggested to Jack that he really do the research of listening differently of inviting Judy to tell him everything on her mind about his mom. And at first, he said, no, first of all, he felt he had done that, he said, it would just open up the floodgates, what's the point of opening up the floodgates when she already over talked it. He had heard it all and I really invited him to do the research of listening very differently and I predicted that he would paradoxically find that Judy's intensity would diminish as she felt less alone and more heard by her partner. And of course, if you try to muscle a partner they only feel more intense and more obsessed. And I invited him to do this, obviously not just to help lower Judy's intensity but to really be able to empathize more fully and more accurately with her experience. So I invite people, I invited him to do what I call the ultimate listening experiment, where you take the initiative to invite the very thing that you dread to really invite a meeting and I learned from Bill O'Hanlon to have the discussion in a new place and not in a room or place where it's gone badly for we don't know how many times and to really tell her that he realized he hadn't listened well that he wanted to hear everything about her experience of these visits and his mother. And that he listened, he entered this conversation only to listen and ask questions, no interruptions, no correcting facts and exaggeration, no looking at side phone or even having it in sight, no trying to explain his mother et cetera et cetera. It's really interesting and I know we probably all have our own different ways of helping couples listen to each other but it's interesting how much changes in a couple when one person can start being so defensive and can really listen and really authentically stay curious about their partner's experience and ask questions and say do I have this right and is there more that you haven't told me. And part of really listening is he also apologized to Judy for handing her the responsibility of entertaining his mother and dealing with his mother during these visits. And he apologized to her for leaving her alone with the criticism. He said to her, I'm really sorry that I haven't talked to my mom about her criticism of you. I know she gets on you all the time and it's not okay. So he let Judy know that he would be opening this conservation with his mother that he would be sort of working and thinking about how do open up the conservation with this mother. And he also you know listening -- wholehearted listening also involves saying when you can't listen, it involves the ability to say I cannot listen to you, not now, not at this time and not when you speak to me in this way. So he also needed to do this with Judy because she would often approach him in this very intense rat-a-tat way, right as he entered the door or he would you know call his mother a toxic bitch et cetera which wasn't useful. So he also as part of wholehearted listening would say you know I am hear for you as a partner to listen to anything you know that you have to say but you need to approach me in a different way, let's talk about this at a different time, you know when we're both calm, no name calling, it's very hard for me to listen. So he told Judy also what he needed from her to listen to her better. And these are never one conversation, you know, these are many, all substance have changed, requires many conversations and not a hit-and-run approach. And often in couples you'll notice, people do just one part of that, they'll say, I'm out of this conversation like I'm gone without saying the other part, without saying I'm your partner, I'm here to talk about anything but not in this way, not in this time. So then, the next challenge of speaking up, talking a bottom line position is that he did tell Judy after he had listened well and let her know that he was really going to be her partner in this. He did take a bottom line position that he could not bar his mother from visiting, that he could not do that. He told her he did this in a loving and firm way, he told her that -- he told her that he had already lost his dad and that it was not possible for him to choose between you know having a wife and having a mother nor could he bear the thought of his children growing up without a real connection to their grandmother as difficult that she was and he also began to initiate conversations about how difficult she was which helped Judy then because she didn't feel she was caring at all to be a bit less reactive. So he took a bottom line position that he would not bar the visits and he also said that he was going to work with her though to ensure the visits where different and that Judy felt supported and protected, so that he was really going to step up to the plate. So the next challenge, you know, the family of origin work, stepping up to the plate, also you know this does not occur in one big conversation. And you know he did need to walk this talk and find his voice with his mother around her pattern of certain automatic pattern of advice giving with Judy. And before he spoke to this, I coached him to move toward his mother and to lessen the distance between them, it had always been a distant relationship, more so since his father's death. And if one is going to -- just wondered if that was my phone because last time I gave a talk I said, would you please turn off the phone, it's my phone. So if one is going to speak to a high twitch area, an emotionally loaded area in one's family of origin, it won't work if you do it from a position of distance. It doesn't work, I would see this when I was at the -- in the Menninger Clinic all the time, you know, someone would be in analysis, they would get in touch with something they really needed to confront a parent or both parents where they would get on the plane and parachute down on their family where nothing had been talked about but sports and weather, you know, these neutral topics, although the weather is no longer a neutral topic, you know when they bring up the hottest issue that hadn't been talked about in several generation and their parents would get it and they would do it in a confrontive way, their parents would get defensive, surprise, surprise and then you know the person would get back on the plane and say you see my parents can't listen. So I -- I helped him just in phone calls and there are many benefits in this to move toward having a more real relationship with his mom, where he asked her how she was really doing since his dad's death, where he would share something about himself, like a problem at work and ask for her perspective or ask for her help in remembering something about her dad, he treated his mother for the first time as if she had something to offer and you know of course feeling useful is a great antidote against despair and part of his mother's constant advice giving to her daughter-in-law had to do with her just feeling so unemployed and adrift and et cetera, et cetera. So after closing up -- oh another thing he did, which is so important is that when his mother next visited I encouraged him to take a day of work, it's one day off work and do some alone thing with his mother, it didn't matter like take her to the museum or you know go out to lunch, the initial response I get is I can't take a day of work, it's impossible, it's like not allowed and really, in 98% of the cases, people can take a day of work and it really changes everything. So took a day of work and then he did you know and I helped him with direct coaching and role playing to consider how he would talk about his mother about his criticalness -- her criticalness of Judy in a non-blaming way, in a loving and non-blaming way. I believed that anything that can be said, can be said kindly and when one can say it kindly and without an edge, an intensity in one's voice which is the hardest thing for me you know to get that edge out unless it's your family, I mean, if were dealing with one of your family's members. So I mean, he basically he did a very good job and you know he said something like mom you know you and Judy are the most important women in my life and Judy is my wife and you're my mother and I really love you both and respect you both and I need you get along and he said, I know that you're an expert on raising kids and Judy and I are still figuring it out but even if we make mistakes we need to do it our own way and so forth, you know we need your respect and support rather than advice even when you know we're making mistakes and he also made sure his mother knew that Judy's child-rearing practices whereas much his as hers, you know he clarified that. Now, what you think happens in this initial conservation, do you think his mother says oh, you know of course I mean that has been very insensitive of me and I'm gonna get a lot more bite marks on my tongue because I realize that's like the more mature thing to do. I mean, it doesn't happen that way, so Jack you know I helped him be prepared for the counter moves and many conversations and you know one time for example his mother said well, you know, I'll just keep all my opinions to myself and even if Judy is like burning the house down, you know, I'm not going to say anything. You know and Jack hugged her and he said, you know mom, if you know actually advices isn't helpful to us right now, but if you believe that we really need to be doing something differently come to me, you know tell me about it, I'm your son, I'm not made of tissue paper and you know tell me about it. Dealing with these conversations which again are multiple conversations, it requires a tremendous amount of courage and it was easier on both sides because he had had on the phone real conversations with his mom that he had worked to close up the distance and he had invented his mom to be helpful to him especially around some issues about the loss of his dad and the fact that he felt he never knew his dad. So moving from the specific example of Jack, I just want to say a little more about these two simple challenges of listening and having a bottom line, I say this for all of us. You know, we all know it's not just in couple relationships, we all know that how we talk and how we listen determines how things go for couples, for relationships. But most people are far more motivated to work on the talking part than they are on the listening part and when I was at Menninger, for many years I did -- a colleague of mine, Marianne Ault-Riche, the two of us did workshops in the community called Talking Straight and Fighting Fair and they were all day workshops and women -- for women and women were like breaking the doors down to come to the workshops. So because they wanted to get through, you know they wanted to exceed the threshold of deafness of their partner. So I decided to give a workshop on listening because that is equally if not more important if you want to be listened to as well. So I had to cancel my workshop because like people just didn't show up, I mean, they weren't enough people and these are my bookmarks, I have to -- there is a great quote about listening on these bookmarks. Brené -- I have to tell you this story, my friend Brené Brown gave me these bookmarks because there was a ten-year period between my last book and Marriage Rules and I had become a marketing dinosaur. And Brené said to me, well you have to have bookmarks and she send me as a gift a box of like two million of these bookmarks but she put marriage -- she put a great quote on the back that she heard me say at a talk that she attended. And the quote is, if we would, it says, I said, if we would only listen with the same passion that we feel about wanting to be heard, okay. Won't it be a very different world if our wish to understand the other person where as great as our wish to be understood. So since I have 20 million bookmarks, I brought them for you, they are both at the book table where the books are, you don't to buy a book, take a bookmark and also at the table buy the conference center. So don't forget to take a bookmark, so I don't have to take them home. And of course you know it's easy to listen if we like what the person is saying but if we don't want to hear it, if we're being criticized for example, you know we are wired for defensiveness, it takes a nanosecond and we automatically listen for the piece we don't agree with, we automatically listen for the exaggeration, the inaccuracies, the distortions that will be there so we can correct and make our case. And we can help our clients to listen differently, we can help our clients to enter to both initiate and enter a conversation with the intention that they will only listen to understand and to ask questions and to be curious and to say is there more you haven't told me and do I have this right and then the next day to mention the conservation and express appreciation and to let their partner know they've been thinking about the conservation. And then, they can define their differences. I encourage clients to -- with their partner to do what I call the two step, to think in terms of at least two conservations because people think they have to do everything in one conversation, which is a big mistake. So in the first conversation, they're going to enter it only to listen and understand and then in the second conversation, they are going to speak to the differences and this is equally as important because it's at the heart of what we call -- what I call differentiation of self, so that one might say for example, you know, I thought about our conversation and I really get it that I ignored you at the party. And as I said, I'm really sorry. The piece I don't agree with, the piece I see differently as I think about it is I don't agree that I was responsible for your over drinking because as I see it, I'm responsible for my own behavior but I'm not -- I'm not responsible for your behavior. Step two is very important, to finding one's differences, I pay a special attention, it's difficult for men who tend to be more conflict avoidant and would prefer just to drop it and are more likely to manage emotional intensity through distancing whereas women are more likely to move into the fray in my experience. So you know there is a popular joke and sexually international, I've heard in other countries, I first heard it in Mexico, international joke that maintains that the husband should have the last word in any confrontation. And that that last word should be, you're right honey, I'm wrong I'm really sorry and I'll never do it again, okay. Well, this isn't good enough, just not good enough. So with that part two of defining one's differences is important. In terms of a bottom line, bottom line, it's so difficult in marriage. So I have ten rules in marriage rules just for bottom line in couple relationships, people start out okay, but then a fog you know descends on their brain and it sort of goes back to the same old fights. A bottom line position, just to define it very briefly is that place where one's core values, priorities, and beliefs are not negotiable under relationship pressures. A bottom line position evolves from a very deeply felt position, a position in the body of what one feels entitled to and the limits of one's tolerance. There is no one bottom line position obviously for all couples, but when the bar is too low or one person has no bottom line, the relationship will spiral downward, it will simply spiral downward. And a bottom line position can be about a very serious issue like a wife who I was seeing in therapy and her husband was diagnosed with sex addiction and when I first started seeing her, she was reading all the literature on sex addiction and she couldn't take a position with someone who had a disease and so forth. And you know after some work, much work in therapy, she came to a place and this is an example of a very serious bottom line position, where she said to him and not in an angry time, one takes a bottom line position when you're actually liking your partner. And she said to him, you know you can, we can call it sex addiction, we can call it sauerkraut I can't live this way. I don't care if the problem is caused by testosterone or neurological thing or your trauma or your -- the moon or stars or grace it doesn't matter anymore, what matters is that I realize that I can't live with this and feel good about myself for you and the marriage. And if there is one more emotional affair or big affair, I'm now like on a seven point scale of divorce out of ten. I will be a ten and I need you to hear this and I also had her as I do write this in a card to him. I needed her to change the medium or add a new medium because there had been so many threats and some -- so much talk of divorce and this now she had reached a place of a real bottom line or a bottom line by the way can be something quite trivial, I mean it can be something not trivial, but when you know like someone says to their partner, look you know I'm not participating in this conversation if you don't get out of your debate mode right now. And that may be a bottom line, what makes it a bottom line is that, one's words are congruent with one's actions, they are truly in the body. So in functional marriages, when I think about the best marriages, it's not the people go around with -- with their arms crossed in front of their chest, you know speaking in eye statements and taking bottom line positions all the time. In the best marriages, I see at least one person actually is very flexible and may accommodate for their partner 87% of the time, is very flexible, has a light touch, is funny, can pass on less intensity than they receive but when it matters they can take a clear bottom line position for self. It's sort of like, stand like an oak, bend like grass. And the bending like grass is more, it's more important you know that effort on that the storm, how does it go, the storm breaks the mighty oak, but only bends the fragile blade of grass. You know flexibility really does trump shear strength in marriage but again you can be flexible 87% of the time. I made that number up but people love numbers. But yeah take a bottom line position and you know bottom line position has to coexist also with a profound respect for differences, but people confuse those because people you know we all know that marriage requires a profound respect for differences and I just have to tell you that a great cartoon that I have up in my consulting room about respecting differences, it shows a dog and a cat in bed together and the dog is looking morose and reading a book called dogs who love too much. And the cat is saying, I'm not distancing, I'm a cat damn it. It's a great cartoon because couples really need to lighten up about differences, we all see reality to such a different filter depending on our race and class and generation and family history and genetic make-up and you name it, but sometimes people become so tolerant of differences and this is what I really dislike about the Mars Venus stuff, I mean that that it becomes a way to make excuses and not expect enough you know this idea of gender differences that people then don't expect enough from their partner, it's sort of like oh, he can't vacuum the rug, you know his penis will get in the way as you know because it's a difference. So, anyway in conclusion, you know I exaggerate, but really I exaggerate only a little bit for some. You have to watch out for these gender differences. Through our words for all of us and the quality of our listening, we can create a more accurate and enhancing view of the self, which is always a work in progress and the other and the possibilities between us. And it's a very tall order, these three challenges are very tall order, but like all things worth doing, it's a matter, it is a matter of motivation, helping a client to be motivated and curious to do the research of making a change, one needs goodwill, a genuine wish for a better relationship, which is difficult to come by in itself and the willingness to practice, practice and practice. So thank you so much.
