Introduction Marie L. Miville, Ph.D. Winter Roundtable Director 

00:00:00
MARIE L. MIVILLE I'm gonna go ahead and introduce our, our wonderful, uh, recipient this year of the Janet Helms Mentoring Award, Dr. Alvin Alvarez. Um, you know, in your, in your book, you have all the, um, the fancy-schmancy stuff we put on a CV, um, Associate Dean now. He's, he's helping to run the college of Health and Human Services. He's a Professor of Counseling at San Francisco State. He trains master levels students in, to become college counselors and student affairs practitioners. He completed his counseling psychology degree, uh, at the University of Maryland at College Park and his undergraduate work was at the University of California Irvine. His professional interests have focused on Asian Americans, racial identity and the psychological impact of racism. He is the former, uh, President of the Asian American Psychological Association and he actually received an early career award from AAPA as well as the Tanaka (ph) Memorial Dissertation Award from APA. He says his primary motivation, I don't know if many of you know this, but he is the father of two beautiful daughters, one who was just born a few months ago. Their names are Sabrina and Sophie and he works hard to make the world better for them. Um, so I would like to ask Dr. Alvarez to come on up and give us his address.

ALVIN N. ALVAREZ Thank you, sir. So, um, you know, since we're talking about Joe and Janet, let me start off with a story here because I think, um, if it wasn't for them, I would have been gone by the second month that I'd been at the University of Maryland. I would have left already and, you know, 'cuz I went to the University of Maryland and, you know, I was filled with these ideas to research, I was filled with these questions to pursue around Asian Americans. I was filled with curiosity. I was taught that this was intellectual inquiry, that you can go ahead and do and discover things, right? That's kind of the spirit I went into it with and so I wanted to share a picture of you, uh, of me actually, uh, when I was in grad school. So that's me on the right, over here. Yeah, that's me. I was good to go. This is gonna be good and, uh, I met with my original advisor, uh, uh, an older white gentleman who was a leader in the field, the editor of multiple journals, and somebody I really respected, somebody who I was really looking forward to working with and he said, you know, go, go figure out your thesis thing, come back and come, give me back your ideas. Okay. No problem. So I came back in and, uh, the second meeting and he says so what do you got? I said well, you know, I wanna study white therapists and I wanna study white therapists and their racial identity and I wanna see how that affects how they work with people of color. Seemed like a pretty good idea, right? Seems like a good idea in an audience like this. And he looked at me, he kinda leaned back in his chair and he said hmm. That, that, that, that, that's really, um, that's really pulling the tiger's tail. You, you know when you pull the tiger's tail, it could go back and bite you. I, I, I, I, I don't know if you wanna risk your career at such an early start. Month two. I sat there, I was like um, gee, I feel nervous. This doesn't feel right. I, I, I was scared. I felt threatened. I thought I was, I could come up with a question and I could pursue it, right? I could do whatever I want, 'cuz it's intellectual inquiry. I didn't know exactly what to do um, and I went out of that room feeling deflated and I think this slide captures that feeling about learning about a particular culture and learning that the research and the work that everybody in this room does is not value free. It's highly political and I remember Joe said hey, you know, when you get to Maryland, look up this woman, Janet Helms. Who the hell is that? All right, sure. I had nobody else to turn to, didn't really know who Dr. Helms was. I'd seen her in the hallways a few times and so I sat, I, you know, I said, you know, Dr. Helms, uh, could I, could I, uh, set aside some time to talk with you and she said sure. Come, come on in and we'll talk. And we sat down and then I relayed the story to Janet exactly as I relayed it to you and I said so, so what do you, what do you think I should do? And she looked at me and she said hmm. She said that's funny. I think pulling the tiger's tail can be fun. I think you could make your career out of pulling the tiger's tail. And I was like this is the woman I want to work with because immediately, in two minutes, affirmation for a complete stranger. Right? She didn't know me from Adam. She already had an advisee at that time. In fact, that advisee is sitting right next to her, a few seats down right now. So I'd be extra, you know? So I said can I work with you? And she said well, let's see how it works out and see what you can do and if it doesn't work out with the other adviser, yeah. Okay. But what I learned from that moment is that the work we do is political but more importantly, that part of the work we do is to challenge the status quo, is to challenge the status quo. That's the message I took from that. And in my particular area of research and scholarship, the status quo needs a lot of changing, needs a lot of change. So I wanna shift forward a little bit and share another story with you about a time when that smile got wiped off my face and I was very ashamed to be a psychologist. Embarrassed to be a psychologist. Uh, it was 1999 and, uh, I had just joined the faculty at San Francisco State. I'd been there about two years by that point and I had met some folks in some civil rights groups and two lawyers had asked me to come in and meet with them because they were trying a case in the San Francisco Housing Authority. Apparently, southeast Asians and Chinese low income families were being put in the projects and, uh, they were being attacked. Uh, their homes were getting invaded. People were getting beaten on the street. Cars were being set on fire. Kids were being scared and bullied as they walked home and there was a systematic pattern of abuse that kept happening and the San Francisco Housing Authority ignored it and did nothing for years and years and years. Just to share with you a little bit, to give you a sense, this is a quote that a young woman, a mother of four, heard as she was walking home that day and this was the last thing she heard just before she got jumped, kicked, beaten, and, and left for dead on the street. She made it. This was the kind of thing that people in my community were experiencing and what she, what the lawyers were saying to me was very simple. Look, we want you, uh, to help consult with, on this case so that we wanna begin documenting the psychological literature around racism. We want you to show that racism is a bad thing. Can you help us with that literature? Pretty straightforward question, yeah? Easy question, it seems like. And I had to look at 'em and I said there really isn't any. And he looked at me, this guy completely trained in a different field, civil rights lawyer, he looked at me and he asked me a question that just made me shrink. And when he looked at me, he said what the hell have you guys been doing? What, what, what have you guys been doing, okay? Not a whole lot. Take a look at this slide. All right? The number of studies at that point that had been done around the issue of Asian Americans and racism as the target of racism, in 1999 what do we got? Seven. Seven studies. So when they asked me, that's what I was basically reflecting on. Seven studies. But, let, let's put this in context. I'm a teacher so I like quizzes, right? So this is the realities of 1999 but let's think about history, right? Let's thing about history. Okay. Asian Americans have been in this country, well, it depends on who you ask but if you ask Filipinos, we've been around since 1760, right? If you ask other groups, you might get a different answer. But Asian Americans have been here for a long, long time but let's put this in context 'cuz there's been a number of experiences that we've gone through that have been equally powerful to our immigration experience. So, Chinese Exclusion Act. Anybody remember when the Chinese Exclusion Act was? Karen, you can't because you're an Asian American Studies. But, uh, anybody else venture a guess? Dates? 1850. Good, very close. Anybody else? What's that? 1854. 1860. Nice, nice. Good, good. We're close. 1882. Okay? Let's move on. Executive Order 9066. What year? Anybody remember? What's that? 1940. Good. 1942. Seventy years ago. Okay? Last question. The murder of Vincent Chin in Detroit. Okay? Anybody remember the year? 1987. Very, very close. You guys are good. You guys are good. 1982. Thirty years ago. In fact, the internment was 70 years ago this month. Vincent Chin died 30 years ago this June. Okay? And so not only have Asian Americans been here for a long time, the point I want to make with this slide is that part of that experience that has been equally persistent has been the experience of discrimination. That has been part and parcel of what we have experienced. But it's not just historical. It's also happening now and since I was in New York, I couldn't resist looking this up. Okay? The little things aren't so little, okay? Especially if they get repeated over and over. So this is not just a historical artifact. It's a present day artifact, right? And why is that? Well, the majority of the research for a long time really focused on how people became racist and we have ignored, for much of our experience, the impact of racism on people. Much of the work has really been done and honored by our, my colleagues in the African American community by the Asian American community has been, in my opinion, woefully behind. In fact, one of the critiques and struggles I have within the Asian American literature is that we focus so much on culture and ethnic identity that we oftentimes forget some of the racial dimensions that are as real, a part of our experiences. So this is why I was frustrated. This is why I was struggling, uh, when those folks were talking to me. So much so that the handbook of Asian American Psychology, the very first edition, so let me put you in context here, so that when you think of a handbook right now, right? What's a handbook? It's the thing that puts together the best in the field. It's the thing that complies and points to the direction in the future and when that was first printed, I was so excited to read and see that there was a chapter entitled racism. I'd never seen that in a book dedicated solely around Asian Americans and I read it. It was like okay, Chinese Exclusion Act. Great, knew that. Executive Order 9066. Great, knew that. Murder of Vincent Chin. Great, knew that. It was a history lesson. And at the end of this history lesson, they concluded this: that more is known about the historical context than the psychological impact. And this is the handbook. This is the compendium of what's best and this is the state of affairs in 1998. So where are we now? A little bit better. Between 2000 and 2009, you can see a real clear uptick in where people were going with this and my colleague here at NYU actually did on their, her annual review of Asian American Psychology, uh, Simio (ph) Chazaki. They documented 24 studies. So clearly this has become a topic within my community. Finally we're awakening to the realities of racism and discrimination as a pivotal experience within a, our community. So let's talk a little bit, I wanna share with a little bit of what we've done. Okay? We've looked at a range of different communities: Chinese, Filipino, South Asians, Koreans, etc. but the bulk, don't let this slide fool you, the bulk of the work has been done primarily in Chinese and Filipinos, right? But when you consider there are 20 ethnic groups within my community, focusing on two, you're leaving a lot of folks out, right? So two is good, not great. The majority of studies have started to look at mental health outcomes and I'm not gonna talk over this entire slide. I will just highlight a few things here. The first one up here, this first study is an interesting study, uh, from the National Latino and Asian American data set and Gee and his colleagues, uh, asked and looked at the relationship between discrimination and 11 psychiatric disorders and one of the things they found was that the frequency of, uh, discrimination increases the rate of psychiatric illness, okay? This one right here, Chalsa (ph) Loo and her colleagues out in, um, Hawaii have done a lot of work on Asian American veterans. Now, um, are there any vets in the room, in the room? None. I'm not a vet myself but when I read this study, I was struck by it because one of the things she found was that Asian American veterans, there was a relationship, a strong robust relationship between discrimination they experienced as vets and PTSD [00:18:20[ above and beyond combat exposure. Let me say that again. Above and beyond combat exposure. So that the trauma that people are experiencing out in, in Vietnam and in that war zone created trauma above and beyond being shot at, being killed, above and beyond that. And this isn't something that's just happening with Asian American Vietnam vets. If some of you may be following a story, there's a Marine, there was a Marine, uh, who was from Santa Clara, uh, Corporal Harry Loo (ph) and here in New York, uh, a private, uh, Danny Chin (ph), who both died as a result of the hazing they experienced, um, within the military. So these are real experiences that clearly have severe consequences. Related to this in a smaller body, the literature is starting to look at physical illness and I'll highlight a few interesting ones here. This one here, they ask a really simple question. Very, very simple question. They asked people in the past 30 days, how often have you not felt physically well? That's it. In the past 30 days, how often have you not felt physically well, okay? And then they took that answer and extrapolated on an annual basis, right? The interesting thing that they found here was that Asian American's who reported experiencing discrimination reported 19 to 51 more days of physical illness. Let me say that again. Nineteen to 51 more days of physical illness than those who didn't report any discrimination. South Asians reported 51, the highest, so think about that. Just think about that. People who are experiencing discrimination are basically being physically ill two months out of the year. Two months. Okay? That's profound. Profoundly disabling. We're also looking at behavioral outcomes. One of the things we found is that discrimination is associated not only with suicidal ideation but also with suicidal attempts. This is killing folks. This isn't just causing them distress. It's leading to death. Down here, a couple points I want to raise is that people, um, who are reporting discrimination also tend to underutilize service. Right? And then the corollary to this is that when they do go seek treatment, they actually, what? Report discrimination in that process. So let's think this through. All these slides in the past that I've shown you, it's documenting the discrimination is harming people. Discrimination is hurting people, debilitating folks but, in terms of seeking treatment, it hinders them from seeking treatment and then when they do go seek treatment, what happens? They experience more discrimination. So not only is discrimination being the primary cause of illness, it's also exacerbating that by delaying treatment and then causing secondary trauma when they are in there. You've got a vicious cycle that is feeding itself and hurting our communities. So clearly this slide is obvious. Pathogenic, it also pushes us to recognize that our health, our well being, is beyond just us as an individual which then causes us to really think about what do we need to do in terms of advocacy outside. But when I look at this slide, I actually hate this slide. It annoys me and it annoys me because I just think it's so obvious and I shouldn't be up here in front of people having to say the obvious things and I am reminded, when I was in the throes of my dissertation, I really didn't want to do it. I was three years ABD and I remember sitting one day in Janet's office and I said this is just dumb. It's just so obvious. And what I said to here was, you know, I feel like all I'm doing is I'm, I'm taking my committee. I'm dragging them into the parking lot and I'm saying that's a car. That's my brilliant idea. That's a car. And it just, you know, I was like my parents have seen cars. I've seen a car. That's dumb. And this is why you need mentors. She turned to me and she looked at me without blinking an eye. She just had a smile. She looked at me and she said there are people in this world who have never seen a car. Right? There are people in this world who have never seen a car, which is why even though I think this slide and everything I've shown you is kind of like this, right? It feels like this when I show this work. The point of it is is it's not obvious because it depends on who you're speaking to and a lot of advocacy is stating the obvious to the oblivious, to those who don't know your experiences. My audience isn't the people in here. This is the choir. I'm talking to the people who never went to church, okay? Those are the people we're talking to and part of what we do in terms of advocacy is giving voice to those who have no voice, who, those who are silenced. Giving voice and shedding light on the needs of those who are oppressed and ultimately challenging the empirical and theoretical status quo and, and I want to sit a moment on this slide because I think this is, this last point is, it's critical, okay? Because we are in a professional culture where if it's not in a journal, it doesn't exist. In 1999, the experiences of my community in terms of discrimination did not exist to the profession of psychology, public health, nursing, none of that. It didn't exist. It wasn't studied and if it's not empirically existing and if it doesn't exist, if it doesn't empirically exist, then it doesn't get funded. If it doesn't empirically exist, it doesn't get treated. If it doesn't empirically exist, we don't support that, right? And so a lot of what we're doing, at least in this phase of the literature, is stating the obvious to the oblivious. But there's a long way to go. There's a long, long way to go, right? And I'm reminded then of an experience that, uh, I had with Joe right before I left for graduate school. We were at Koko's. (ph) Remember that? Yep. God I remember that. We sat there for hours and I was trying to decide between whether or not I should go to medical school or graduate school and you were trying to be very neutral and supportive of everything. And I remember you asked me well, what do you want to study? And I said well, you know, Joe I wanna study this and you looked at me and you said hadn't been done. I wanna study X. Hadn't been done. I wanna study Y. It hadn't been done. How about Z? Nope, hadn't been done. And at the end of it, he turned to me. He says look, here's what I'm hearing. It seems like you are interested in medicine but you're fascinated by psychology. Let me say that again. You are interested in medicine but fascinated by psychology and it was an important distinction between something I was intellectually curious about and emotionally connected to and that was a powerful decision because for me then, that message then, that's the message that I took, that passion is part of our profession. Let me say that again. That passion is part of our profession and that's the moment I committed myself to psychology. That's the moment I said that's clear. That makes sense to me. Listen to that piece. And off I went. The other piece too that really I took from that message then was the fact that, you know, there's a lot that hasn't been done and a lot of us in this room are able to do it and from Robert Frost, we do have miles to go. There's lots of things here and I'm gonna talk through each of these points to some degree and there's much more we need to do within this field. So there's a rich fascination right now, a rich literature growing that has focused on microaggressions. Daryl (ph) has done a fantastic job. Thank you Daryl for shedding the light on this and really cutting a path for us. And, you know, this has been a gift because this has opened the doors on this whole body of research. The items you have before you are from one of the most common scales used within, uh, this literature. This is from David Williams' scale and it's a fairly straightforward scale. You respond to this and see how often it's happened to you. That's it. Right? But let's think about this. One of the things we've argued clearly within the literature, within our own experiences is that racism and discrimination is what? More than just microaggressions. There's a lot of micro, uh, other forms of racism that we have yet to study. All those slides that I showed you around the impact, (inaudible ), suicidal ideation, PTSD, those are all based on microaggressions. So everything I've shown you is the outcomes primarily between microaggressions and those health outcomes. We have no idea the impact of losing a job. We have no idea the impact of coming home and finding that your car is set on fire or not getting that loan or not getting that promotion. We have some clear ideas on this. We have very few ideas around this. And so one of the things that we need to do is actually begin to look at different forms of, uh, racism in addition to microaggressions. We also need to begin looking at complexity. Much of the data that we're looking at in our field, my field right now, is actually blurring things a lot and really aggregating Asian Americans. Yet some of the preliminary data shows that's just not the case. For instance, there have been some clear gender patterns. Men in, typically report more experiences of discrimination than women. Ethnic differences. Filipinos have been found, on a number of different studies, to report more experiences than other Asian ethnic groups. There have been some geographic differences. Uh, a couple of studies have found that people in San Francisco tend to actually report more experiences of discrimination than people in either Hawaii or the east coast, which is kind of odd to me. You know, I've always, you know, people often think of San Francisco has kind of an Asian oriented mecca yet people there are reporting more experiences of discrimination. Why is that? Don't know yet. The point I'm trying to make from the slide is that there's some complexities here that our work has yet to uncover. We're also looking at domain specificity, right? A lot of the items are very (inaudible ) contextual. You are called names or insulted and you're asked how frequently does this happen? How do you cope with it? But let's think this through. How you respond to that could be different than how you respond to these. You are called names or insulted at work could be a very different experience than being you are called names and being insulted at school or the same experience in a store. You can even deepen it. You are called names or insulted at work could be very different when you say the person calling the name was your boss versus your colleague versus your subordinate. Right? So the experience of discrimination that we're looking at is still at a very surface level. We're not looking at the important nuances that often dictate how we experience it, how we deal with it, and ultimately how we cope. We have focused also a great deal on the notion of outcomes. But the interesting thing, particularly, uh, uh, from the clinical side of my training, is we have very little idea about what helps people. So some very basic questions about it that I get a lot is like how do people cope? What's a good way to cope with racism? I think as clinicians we might have answers to that but in terms of the empirical literature, not a whole lot. Uh, look at this. Seven studies have focused on coping. That's it. Out of those 86 studies that we had, I had shown you earlier in the slides, only seven have looked at coping and I've done two of them. Right? So I understand, and the findings we have found in my studies have been conflicting. So the picture is far from clear. Okay? This behind me is a summary of the work that's been done around racism within clinical settings. How do we help Asian Americans within a clinical setting deal with racism. That slide right there shows you exactly what we know. That's it. To my knowledge, there hasn't been a study around this topic. Okay? But as clinicians, we know from our own experiences, from working with people, talking to people, right, that there's a lot of factors that go in there. From our own identities, from our own experiences, from our racial identities, from coping to validation to psycho-ed. There's a number of factors that happen in there. Have we studied it? No. No. We're far from it. So there needs to be a lot of work done here. But as we're talking about the clinical realm, I am reminded of a reverend who, in the late 60s, talked about that one of the best gifts that psychology has given to use as a world is this notion of adjustment, right? This notion of adjustment. And well being. But one of the things he also cautioned was that the notion of adjustment is a double-edged sword, okay? And the Reverend Martin Luther King in addressing the American Psychological Association said, "There are some things concerning which we much always be maladjusted if we are to be people of good will." Our job shouldn't be to make our clients, our communities just endure and survive. Our job, hopefully when we do it well, is to make people thrive. And so by extension, this quote really calls for us to step beyond just the clinical work, step beyond that room and try to address what's going on in the larger scheme and I think the direct descendent of this particular sentiment, which has been with it, with us for a while, is really in some of the work that's been emerging for a number of years and then so I wanna call out Dr. Rebecca (ph) Park. Rebecca, raise your hand. Okay. So you can mob Rebecca later on and get her autograph. She's the one who writes about this along with a number of folks. This is really, you know, in the spirit of Reverend King is really calling us to go beyond the individual and learn to address the larger system. Right? And she's got this great, beautiful slide which I've shown in a number of places and we oftentimes focus on this box, clients. Right? But the comments that you're really getting at, the comments from Dr. King, right, and the issues we're really dealing with is how to address things out in the community. How do we address things in the public sphere and this particular area really strikes me as the realm of scholarship in terms of information because I think a lot of scholarship, what we're doing then, is really disseminating information, challenging what's out there. And there's a lot to be done. But also within our own communities, there's a lot of education because, at least within the Asian American communities, my experience has been that this is not something we talk about a great deal and I'm currently doing a study with a colleague of mine at Lehigh University, Aprina (ph) Inman (ph) and we are, uh, listening to and hearing the stories of South Asian immigrants and their experiences around discrimination and one of the fascinating things I hear when I hear those stories is at the end of the focus groups, these group of people often turn to each other, go this was wonderful. This was great. We should do this again. We've never, I've never sat here and done something like this and that's a theme that echos, the sense of where do we talk about this? How do we as a community create spaces where we actually share our stories and validate each other? And so this notion of community support and education is critical. Lastly, we often talk, uh, next is we often talk about this as a mental health issue but discrimination isn't a mental health issue, not just. Right? It's a public health issue. It's a health issue. It's a legal issue. Its an issue within the media and communications and the point I wanna try and make here is that this is not something for psychology alone to bear, nor should it be. This, we're talking about large, intricate systems and I don't often see psychology partnering up in some powerful ways with other colleagues in other disciplines and if there are ways we can pool our resources together, like Asian Americans, like the Asian American Psych Association and the Asian American Journalist Association could be a powerful bridge to each other. I don't see that happening nearly as much. Similarly, around cross-racial coalitions, this isn't just an Asian thing. Not by a long shot. And we need to create partnerships with other people of color to actually address this so that when I'm in a room, I know and I can trust that my colleagues from other communities, the African American community, the Latino community, the Native community, will stand up for me no matter who is in the room, right? And one example of this actually is a cross racial coalition. Some of you know a little bit about a project we've been working on is that for the very first time, the Asian American Psychological Association, the Association of Black Psychologists, the National Latina/Latino Psychological Association, the Society of Indian Psychologists, and Division 45 of APA have gotten together and we're forming a leadership institute. And this institute is designed to create the relationships, the communities, that can be created at the very beginning of people's careers so that when they get to those positions of leadership, they can leverage those relationships so they can work together. This is the kind of coalition building I hope to see more of. I've been talking a long time and maybe some of you have tuned out and that's fine and honestly, if you remember nothing about what I've said here, that's okay. You don't have to listen to me and quite frankly my words, these studies, are nowhere near as powerful as people's experiences.

00:39:55
MICHELLE KO Unfortunately not. Unfortunately not. My students don't know about it and when I talk to other educators around the country, they find the same thing in the classroom when they talk to students, that students don't know who Vincent Chin is and they don't know the story.

PHILIP CHUNG Especially with younger people, you know, you ask, you tell them about Vincent Chin and I don't think people really know and I'm talking about Asian Americans. You know. Or they might have heard of the name but who, who's that really? 

00:40:15
Robin Toma LA County Commission on Human Relations 

00:40:15
ROBIN TOMA One, we don't necessarily expect that if we talk to a group of youngsters today that they would know who Vincent Chin is. In fact, I wore my shirt today because I knew that most people, in fact I just came from a get together of adults and I told them where I was going. They said who's Vincent Chin or what's that about? 

00:40:30
Vincent Who? 

00:40:30
One the 25th anniversary of the death of Vincent Chin, a series of townhalls were organized around the country 

00:40:30
Each townhall included screening of the Academy Award-nominated documentary by Christin Chow and Ranpe Tamla-Pana, "Who Killed Vincent Chin?" 

00:40:35
[music] 

00:40:35
Judy Chu California State Board of Equalization Chair 

00:40:35
JUDY CHU I remember the exact moment when I heard about the hate crime murder of Vincent Chin. I'd just graduated from college. I'd just gotten a good job teaching in the Los Angeles Community College district. I'd just gotten married to this man over here and I felt that I had the whole world's opportunities awaiting me and then I heard about the horrible hate crime murder of Vincent Chin. I read about how he was in a club celebrating his impending wedding, how two white auto workers, Ronald Ebens and Michael Nitz started yelling at him that it's because of you that we're out of work. 

00:41:50
First Camera INRC October 30, 1983 

00:41:50
UNKNOWN Japanese imports up, American car production down. Layoffs, welfare lines, desperation, and resentment. In some places, Union sponsored trash a Toyota parties, striking out at a symbol of the problem. 

00:42:05
JUDY CHU I was horrified to learn how they followed him out, grabbed him and held down as they hit him with a baseball bat until Vincent's skull's cracked and how Vincent's last words were it's not fair, before he slipped into a coma and died. 

00:42:25
VIKKI WONG Vincent Chin's fiance 

00:42:25
VIKKI WONG I was with him for four days. Every day is enough. Go in there and see him. Just sit next to him. But he was unconscious so then we pull the plug. 

00:42:45
JUDY CHU But I was just stunned beyond imagination when I learned that the judge let off his murderers with a fine of $3,000 and three years of probation. 

00:43:00
JUDGE CHARLES KAUFMAN Wayne County Circuit Court 

00:43:00
JUDGE CHARLES KAUFMAN The victim lingered for four days, which again, based upon everything, was indicative to me that they attempted to administer a punishment. They did this too severely in careless, reckless disregard of human life, which is what manslaughter is and that's what they were found guilty of and that's what I predicated my sentence on. Had it been a brutal murder, of course these fellows would be in jail now. 

00:43:25
JUDY CHU It sent a clear message to me that this judge felt that the life of an Asian American was worthless. No more valuable than if Vincent were a dog. I felt more vulnerable than I ever had before. Vincent Chin was just like any of us Asian Americans. In fact, he was like me. He had just started a good job as an industrial draftsman. He was a person that was just about to get married, with 400 guests ready to come to his wedding. He was 27 years old, thinking himself that the world's opportunities were waiting for him. 

00:44:05

LILLY CHIN I lost my son and I lost everything. I (inaudible ), he is my only son. I lost him. I lost a (inaudible ), my daughter, my future daughter-in-law. I lost everything. I lost my life. My son is in (inaudible ). How come you not come and talk to Mama? 

00:44:30
Under public pressure following the initial sentence, the U.S. Department of Justice charges Ronald Ebens and Michael Nitz with killing Vincent Chin for his race, thus violating his civil rights. 

00:44:30
After a civil rights trial in Detroit, an overturned conviction and a retrial in Cincinnati, Ebens and Nitz are cleared of all charges. 

00:44:30
Neither Ebens nor Nitz served a day in prison for the beating death of Vincent Chin.

00:44:35
This is Why 

00:44:35
ALVIN N. ALVAREZ I'm an only son. I'm also, as many of you know from Marie's introduction, I'm also a father and, uh, seeing that last slide where Mrs. Chin is in front of her son's grave, I can't even imagine that, putting my parent's through that experience if I was just sitting in a bar, looking the way I did, the way I do. I can't imagine my daughters having to live in a world where they should have to be concerned about that and I'm struck by, yes there are professional imperatives. There are moral imperatives about the work we do but, at least for me, this is also some of why I do the work I do. That's Sabrina and that's Sophie. Some of what I'm doing is to make this place a little bit better, a little bit easier and I think there's a lot of work that needs to be done. As I showed this particular video, I was working on this video one day and one of my students came in and she stuck her head in the door. Young, Chinese American woman and she said to me hey, what are you doing? Oh, I"m working on a video. Oh, okay. I said whoa, hold on a sec. Do you know who Vincent Chin is? She looked at me and goes no, who's that? Right after I saw that video and I gotta tell you, I felt like oh my God. I felt deflated. But at the same time, I, there's an opportunity, right? There's an opportunity and that's part of what we do as educators. I said to her look. You got a minute. She goes yeah. Sit down. Come in here. She sat down in the chair, I popped in that video and I rolled it and at the end of it, she looks at me. She goes I never knew any of that. That's what we do as educators. We do have choices. Yes the list that I, the challenges that I've put before you can be despairing but we also have the choice to take some steps forward, right? Dr. Carolyn Payton, and I will end with this, who was the first African American woman to be the Director of the Peace Corp under Jimmy Carter. Uh, one of the things she's famous for, among many things, I also think it's fitting. Dr. Carolyn Payton is a graduate of this university and of this program in 1962, I believe. But one of the things she's famous for is an article she had written in the American Psychologist and she asked all of us, continues to ask all of us.

Who must do the hard things? Those who can. Carolyn Payton (1984) 

00:48:10
ALVIN N. ALVAREZ Who must do the hard things? And this is her response. Not on paper, but for all of you. Those who can. 2.5% of this country have doctorate degrees. W.E.B. Debois talks about the talented tenth. We're even more privileged than that. The people in this room have the research skills, the clinical skills, the teaching skills, the writing skills. We can write grants. We can develop programs. We can teach classes and transform people's minds. Fundamentally then, we have the power and I would challenge you to think that we have the responsibility to pull the tiger's tail. Thank you so much.
