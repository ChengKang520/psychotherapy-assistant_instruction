00:00:25
MURIEL I just couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t… didn’t like to eat, I lost weight. I couldn’t make decisions, I, I really didn’t know what was wrong with me. 

00:00:35
BETTY TELMAN (ph) You know, I felt useless. I just felt as though, you know loss of confidence, I couldn’t do this and I couldn’t do that. And maybe and I can do a lot of things… at, at the same time. And I wasn’t able to just accomplish anything. 

00:00:55
SCOTTY Now back at my house I took a rope climbed the tree put the rope around my neck. But I didn’t jump off, so I came down, I got a bottle of pills and I almost had a whole bottle and my neighbor heard me out coughing so he came over and then he called the ambulance. 

00:01:15
MURIEL You’re a walking zombie and what it’s a, it’s a terrible, terrible feeling of having this of, of um… no life within you.

DARTMOUTH-HITCHCOCK MEDICAL CENTER DEPRESSION AND THE ELDERLY MENTAL HEALTH AND AGING 

00:01:45
JAMIE GUTH Hello, I’m Jamie Guth. There is a saying that growing old is not for sissies. You know later years can bring perspective, tranquility and wisdom, but these years maybe also be a time of loss, a loss of companionship of health, independence, a sense of purpose and for some a loss of hope. 

00:02:10
JAMIE GUTH By some estimates as many as one in five older Americans suffers from symptoms of major depression. And the suffering can sometime lead to suicide, depression is always devastating. But when that occurs late in life, they are added complications major life changes, physical decline, stereotypes about aging. And feeling of shame that can keep you from seeking help, but it is not have to be this way. Depression is not an automatic part of aging, it’s a disease. And like most diseases, it can be controlled and in many cases cured. 

00:02:45
THOMAS E. OXMAN , MD Professor of Psychiatry and Community & Family Medicine Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical, Lebanon, NH Depression is a very specific condition it’s, it is an illness like anything else that occurs, it’s like an infection, like an appendix that get infected and needs to be taken out. It has a course, it has symptoms. But fortunately it also has treatment. And it, it should be considered as a, as a disorder, as a disease not just a part of life. 

00:03:05
CHARLES F. REYNOLDS III , MD Director, Late-Life Depression Evaluation & Treatment Program University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Depression in old age is related not only to biological changes ah… that occur in the brain. But also to life events and other psychosocial events that categorize the lives of older Americans such as bereavement or retirement or a loss of independence or medical illnesses that threaten independence. 

00:03:30
LUCILLE C. KARATZAS , LICSW Director, Elder Program Seacoast Mental Health Center, Portsmouth, NH It’s a, a matter of one and one doesn’t always make two. You know it can be this loss and this health issue plus another um… issue that’s going on, all of it sudden it becomes large than life. And people feel like they can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

00:03:50
BETTY TELMAN (ph) I kept waiting for the light, I, I’m a transcendental mediator and I kept waiting for the light. 

00:04:00
JAMIE GUTH Today you’ll meet three elderly people who've lived through depression. Scotty, who became so depressed after his retirement that he tried suicide. Muriel, who attempted suicide following the death of her husband and Betty, who’s fight with cancer and other health problems brought on her depression. 

00:04:20
BETTY TELMAN (ph) I had cancer over the colon and at the same time that I had cancer of the colon and I had, I had hysterectomy. And during the time that I had, I was having chemotherapy they said that they found out that I had some cancer of the breast, so I went through radiation. And during that time I, I think I was rather brave but after it was all over, I wasn’t functioning. 

00:04:40
JAMIE GUTH Betty Telman(ph) is a retired social worker who is deeply involved in her community. In her profession she was used to giving help, so deciding to get help was hard for her. But once she made up her mind, she knew where she wanted to go. The late life depression evaluation and treatment program is a federally funded research and treatment center connected to the university of Pittsburgh school of medicine in Betty’s home city. 

00:05:10
CHARLES F. REYNOLDS III We’ve been particularly interest in not only helping people to get well, but also to stay well. The nub of the problem is that depression like diabetes or hypertension tends to be a chronic illness. And so it’s not enough something to help someone feel better initially and get well, it’s also important to help them stay well. 

00:05:35
JAMIE GUTH The two most common treatments for depression are medication and therapy. The antidepressants available today are a great improvement over those used in the past. Their side-effects are much less severe and they’re well tolerated by older people. So some doctors began treatment with medication alone, but others believe it helps to use medication and therapy together. The center for late-life depression has been studying the effectiveness of each treatment path. 

00:06:00
CHARLES F. REYNOLDS III We have found for example that when you combine both counseling or psychotherapy and medication for depression that people tend to get well more quickly and to stay well. 

00:06:10
BETTY TELMAN (ph) There was this medication Paxil that you took and you took it every day and they would take blood test to see if it was still in your system and then I would have a, I would have a session with, with the counselor so that helped awesome. I knew that I had some supports, people said “You can call us anytime”. No I’m not one who goes calling anybody, I’m pretty independent about things. But I knew that if indeed I needed help that there were people there who could help me and I was grateful for that. 

00:06:50
So when you see the warning… 

00:06:50
LUCILLE C. KARATZAS Talk therapy and medication work hand and hand, if someone is very depressed they’re not able to concentrate well enough to be able to take advantage of talk therapy. So that we may need to get them on a anti-depressant. So that some of the symptoms will ameliorate to some degree. Then we’re able to look at what is going on in their lives that’s causing some of the depression. 

00:07:20
JAMIE GUTH But before you can treat depression you have to identify it and that’s always easy, especially in older people. 

00:07:25
LUCILLE C. KARATZAS Depression has many different phases and people can feel sad, they can feel irritable, have a sense of guilt that they are not doing thing right. Um… they may also feel like they’re not sleeping enough or sleeping too much, um… they may be eating a lot or not eating at all. So there are a lot of symptoms that we see in depression that may bring someone to realize that, that their life is not the way it should be. 

00:08:00
JAMIE GUTH In addition to varying symptoms there are also different levels of depression and the milder form can sometime go unrecognized. 

00:08:10
THOMAS E. OXMAN Somebody with minor depression is usually able to function in the day-to-day life. They experience some sad mood, they don’t feel right, they don’t enjoy things. But they are getting things done on a, on a day-to-day basis, the functional impairment with major depression is obvious and more severe. 

00:08:30
JAMIE GUTH An added completion is that depression in the elderly is almost always accompanied to by other physical illness. The symptoms often overlap and it can be hard to sort out causing effect. 

00:08:40
CHARLES F. REYNOLDS III Many of the illnesses that are associated with heart diseases for example were cerebrovascular disease also associated with depression in old age. In addition though depression in late-life frequently exist with cognitive impairment. 

00:09:00
THOMAS E. OXMAN Someone who has depression particularly severe depression will have their memory and concentration effected. And they might look they’re suffering from dementia and by treating the depression their concentration and memory will improve enough that the picture goes away. 

00:09:15
JAMIE GUTH Another problem with late-life depression is that as it's hard to diagnose an illness that many patients do not want to acknowledge. 

00:09:25
LUCILLE C. KARATZAS The elderly are of a generation where the modus operandi was you don’t tell other people you’re problems, you solve your own problems, you pull yourself up by your boot straps and you just keep plugging. And for some people that workers, but for lot of people the pain is deep and it is very difficult for them to accept help. 

00:09:55
MURIEL I was healthy supposedly, but um… I just had chemical imbalance, I was told and so, I tried just on my own with my faith and with just um… a really interest in life. And I lost interest in just everything. 

00:10:20
BETTY TELMAN (ph) I guess in the old day you know, it was um… it was that people thought you know they had these things. And especially in the African-American community. 

00:10:35
CHARLES F. REYNOLDS III It’s more acceptable in our culture um… particularly for older people to talk about emotional distress in the idiom of physical distress, I have aches and pains, I’m tried rather than to talk about sadness or anxiety. 

00:10:55
JAMIE GUTH Often a spouse, relative or a close friend is the first to notice the personality chances brought on by depression. And to recognize that help is need, but where do they go to find that help. Specialized programs like the one in Pittsburgh and community mental health centers like this one in Portsmouth, New Hampshire can provide expert diagnosis and care. But most cases of late-life depression are first identified and treated by the patient's own doctor. 

00:11:25
THOMAS E. OXMAN When you observe a family member suffering low mood, lack of pleasure, change in sleep, apatite, energy, concentration the most important thing is to try and get them evaluated by their primary care physician. 

00:11:40
JAMIE GUTH General practitioners are increasing being asked to screen their elderly patients for the possibility of depression. And they are developing ways to incorporate the screening into their regular exams. 

00:11:50
THOMAS E. OXMAN Over the past month how was your mood been, has there been a change in your mood. And are you enjoying things that you normally enjoy. Asking these two question when someone presence with a change in function or at yearly physicals is as effective as screening a tool as any longer instrument or, or battery that we’ve used. 

00:12:15
CHARLES F. REYNOLDS III I’m not enjoying life any more, I wish I were dead, I am not sleeping those are experiences that many older people have and if we talk in those terms. Rather than to use a stigmatized word like depression then we have a chance of engaging them in treatment and keeping them in treatment long enough to do some good. 

00:12:35
THOMAS E. OXMAN We now view depression as a, as a chronic diseases, it’s not some that is there for a week or two. It’s there for, for months. And in many people it reoccurs. 

00:12:45
CHARLES F. REYNOLDS III If depression remains untreated, it doesn’t go away particularly in old age, it can lasts for many year. Sadly, um… one of the most severe or extreme consequences of depression in old age is suicide. 

00:13:00
THOMAS E. OXMAN There is common data information that older people who commit suicide often see a physician within a month or two before actually committing suicide. But in these visits they rarely convey that they're depressed or suffering. It’s a two way street we need to help the older person express their, their suffering and have the, the primary care physician be more tuned to picking it up. 

00:13:25
JAMIE GUTH Any one caring for the elderly should be aware of certain circumstance that automatically rise a red flag. Depression often develops after a heart attack or stroke. It’s also associated with chronic sleep problems, especially insomnia, but there are other non-medical situations that also increase the risk. 

00:13:45
CHARLES F. REYNOLDS III Probably one in ten to one in five older people who experience the loss of a spouse develop clinically significant depression. Also elderly who are serving as caregivers, particular say for a family member suffering from Alzheimer's disease may experience emotional burn out and clinical depression. 

00:14:10
MURIEL My second husband had an amputated leg and so I was a caregiver for him. And then after he died, I went into this slump, I’ve had problems with some of my children and I, as I think back I felt that the kids would get more help if they didn’t have to worry about me, they would get more help out of inheriting somebody. I was standing at the kitchen here at the cover where I keep the medicines and just on an impulse. I took the medicine and then I was unconscious and I don’t remember. A friend of mine happened to come soon enough to call and get an ambulance and take me to the hospital. And then I had shock treatment after that. 

00:15:05
JAMIE GUTH The medical term for shock treatment is electroconvulsive treatment or ECT. It’s a procedure that can be very effective when depression has reached the danger point. 

00:15:15
CHARLES F. REYNOLDS III ECT is a very straightforward and benign medical procedure which involves the use of a light stage of anesthesia and muscle relaxant not just one would use in the application of a small amount of electricity to convert an abnormal heart rhythm to a normal rhythm. And yet it’s an absolutely life saving technique for people suffering from severe types of depression. It works quickly for the most part there is little memory or other cognitive impairment associated with it. Patients and families are grateful for the rapidity(ph) of recovery typically seen an ECT treatment. 

00:15:55
JAMIE GUTH ECT enabled Muriel Phile(ph) to reclaim her life. 

00:16:00
MURIEL I wanted to do things, I wanted to attend meetings of church and historical society and women's club and book club. And I just wanted to be in life again, it was like a… a shade had been lifted. So I firmly believe in shock treatments at least it was right for me. 

00:16:25
JAMIE GUTH Muriel's overdose happened shortly after her husband's death. But even our life change that some see as positive can trigger a dangerous down slide. 

00:16:35
LUCILLE C. KARATZAS Many men have their whole identity wrapped up in their work room. And when they retire it becomes very difficult for them. They don’t have the skills to, to know what to do with their time. Um… the first year may not be too bad, because they’ve always wanted to do this, this or that. And they’ve cleaned the garage… I’ve had every single client that I have male client that I have had has done a lot of cleaning of their workshop, their garage the first year. But after you’ve done that, then what is there. 

00:17:10
SCOTTY Till then I retired you know, at the beginning you know I found, I found enough to do, but then I just got I don’t know what, what happened I just got in a, you know not this time and I would get out, I get down and get the paper and I’d sit down by the train or the train tracks. Just kind of flow life(ph). 

00:17:35
JAMIE GUTH Scotty would spent most of his working life as a electrical line men. 

00:17:40
SCOTTY I love my job, I love that I had a lot of this, we had this fall, summer and we worked all different places, we were given service to get all the people. And it was a good, good job. And I like the outside. 

00:17:55
JAMIE GUTH One day after he retired well, his wife was playing golf Scotty went inside and swallowed almost an entire bottle of pills. 

00:18:05
SCOTTY And I couldn’t explain it to her why I did it. But I just got so bad well I was flat and then you know there was nothing there for me. 

00:18:10
LUCILLE C. KARATZAS Depression can sap a person’s energy to the point where it is difficult to get out from the bed in morning and then why bother, you know I don’t want to get up, because it's just going to be another day like yesterday, you know when I hear that I know there’s a problem. 

00:18:30
CHARLES F. REYNOLDS III The center is for disease control has data that demonstrate that rates of suicide are highest among the elderly particularly one among white man aged 75 and older where the rate of suicide is some six times that of the general population that’s sad because its preventable. 

00:18:55
JAMIE GUTH This was not Scotty's first experience with depression. When he was much younger he suffered what he calls a collapse. He received electric shock treatment and met with a psychiatric for several weeks. Then his treatment ended and he went back to work. But symptoms of depression remained. 

00:19:15
SCOTTY Back in those days that, you know I've (inaudible ) you know you didn’t have any, anyplace to go to, so I had the live with it. 

00:19:25
LUCILLE C. KARATZAS Many people who have had depression throughout there lives, but it was never diagnosed or they may have had many periods of feeling blue, feeling sad and they just figured that that was part of life and they had to deal with it. 

00:19:40
JAMIE GUTH But depression is not a necessary part of life. And today there is good treatment that works even people who have lived with depression for years often not knowing what it was can finally recover from it. 

00:19:55
SCOTTY I've over come to the point where I enjoy living today. I think the better case in the treatments (inaudible ) I think it was a combination, I think that’s the main thing you have the talk to somebody and I don’t have to see you anymore. 

00:20:10
JAMIE GUTH Scotty is a different person today with medical treatment support from his church and his community and long term therapy his life has changed. 

00:20:20
LUCILLE C. KARATZAS Many people feel that Oh, they are old why bother, you know I'd feel depressed too if I was old. Well, you know not all elderly people are depressed. Not all elderly people have given up on life. Even in nursing homes where depression is all too common and many residents have given up, it's not too late to make things better. 

00:20:50
THOMAS E. OXMAN When you go into a nursing home that’s a major loss of independence and that's one of the most difficult developmental issues that older people have to struggle with. 

00:20:55
CHARLES F. REYNOLDS III When we say that depression kills older people, it's nowhere more apparent than in the nursing home setting. 

00:21:05
JAMIE GUTH But Dr. Reynolds believes that this picture can change. 

00:21:10
CHARLES F. REYNOLDS III Whether you take a psychosocial approach, which allows the person living in a nursing home to engage and more pleasurable activities and to have a greater control over their day today life. Or whether they use a more medically oriented approach involving medication, depression in elderly residing in nursing home response the treatment. 

00:21:30
LUCILLE C. KARATZAS With the support of a caring person it can be, it cannot be a bad thing. I am not saying that it’s a wonderful thing, but it can be better than being alone all day. 

00:21:45
JAMIE GUTH A major factor in late-life depression is our culture is added to toward growing old and added to that has often shared by the elderly themselves. 

00:21:55
LUCILLE C. KARATZAS I think the saddest thing is to see an elderly person, who feels as though their life is over and they're not needed at all. And we need to try to help our elders find some purpose in their life. 

00:22:10
For several years I have been doing too good... 

00:22:10
BETTY TELMAN (ph) In this particular society of America, because what is happening here is that we have, we have emphasized youth. There is lack of respect for, for the, for seniors, but seniors are you know we're put on the back burner. If we don’t fight to make sure that we're not. 

00:22:30
JAMIE GUTH In fact elders are a rich resource for all us and part of the treatment for late-life depression is to help them see how much they have to offer. 

00:22:40
MURIEL I know some friends claim that they think about oh, I am old and then they are depressed. But I thoroughly enjoyed pulling my weight um... or throwing it around and being old, because you know I've lived a lot of life. 

00:23:00
LUCILLE C. KARATZAS One of the reasons that I like to work with the elderly is that they are survivors, they survive the depression, they survived the stock market crash the first one. Um... they have rich histories that make them unique. 

00:23:20
JAMIE GUTH There are many ways in which the elderly can draw on their history. Their rich experience to give them a purpose in life Betty Telman(ph) has involved in a wide range of community activities. She does promotion for the Kuntu repertory theatre serves as Vice President of Pittsburgh's African music institute, coaches seniors in a computer training program and once a week reads to a child in library. 

00:23:45
BETTY TELMAN (ph) My motto on life is services to rent that you pay for your space on earth. 

00:23:50
JAMIE GUTH After a lifetime of teaching music to children in the public schools and in church, Muriel Phile(ph) is teaching herself to play the Irish harp. She also shares her experience with depression to help others. It's all part of what she sees as an ongoing spiritual mission. 

00:24:05
MURIEL All I have is strong faith, I am still in my faith journey, but I am happier than just about than I've ever been in my life. 

00:24:15
JAMIE GUTH For Scotty simple everyday kindness is a way of giving back. 

00:24:20
SCOTTY I am big believer, you know may be pat on my back, a hug or smile. Are you do something every day? You know, not that big but you know, you know a hug to somebody that I can used it as a big booster may be. 

00:24:40
JAMIE RUTH Lucille Karatzas had a client who at the age of 99. He came blind and gave up hope. But she thought(ph) that the neighborhood children she always bake cookies for kept on coming around. Because they wanted to hear her stories. 

00:24:55
LUCILLE C. KARATZAS She had a purpose, she was passing on history and um, culture as well as moral values that she really felt that children needed to here and by being with her they learnt that they had something to offer to. It sounds like a really sweet lady and she died at 101, but she died happier than she was at 99. 

00:25:25
JAMIE GUTH Many people think that working with the elderly can be depressing. Actually the opposite is true. People who are at the final stage of their life have much more of an incentive to make change. They've only got so much time left, they didn’t want to die this way. 

00:25:40
BETTY TELMAN (ph) It's not easy being old, you know your knees hurt, the body you know we're over weight in many cases we get frail and some of us are alone. And so it, it isn’t easy and but we can't just say well it is not easy and just give up. You know because god’s gonna leave us here for (inaudible ) you know until he's planning to take us away, so he better make, make the best of it while we are here. 

00:26:10
MURIEL This is the day, this is the day, this is the day the lord have made let us rejoice, let us rejoice and be clad in it. 

00:26:20
SCOTTY I like that get on the beach, I like to go alone myself, I get all along the coast in a... (inaudible ) and once the mood come up over the horizon. Hey, it's all there for people, but they don’t realize that.
