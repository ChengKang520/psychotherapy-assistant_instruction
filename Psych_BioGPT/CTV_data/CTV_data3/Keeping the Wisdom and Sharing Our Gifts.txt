ELIZABETH A. BOYD Thank you. Can you hear? I get the mic. Okay. Uhm, if you were lucky enough to be in this room this last hour you already know what you need to hear that was amazing that Dr., uhm, Nancy Boyd-Franklin's, uhm, talk. And so I, ah, I wanted just acknowledge the wisdom that she shared with us in this last presentation. Ah, as I thought about, uhm, this topic, uhm, that's, the, the theme of the conference this year honoring our legacy and empowering future leaders. And had to think about what specifically was I going to say how could I add to what has been in amazing dialogue over the last 30 years. Uhm, I felt very humbled, uhm, oath by the opportunity to share some thoughts here and the idea that I might have something to contribute to it. This conference is understand started in 1983, 2 years before I enter graduate school. And as one of only two ethic minority students in my program and all during the years that I was there and without the guiding hand of ever having an ethic minority, uhm, faculty member or mentor it was often the written words of the people who contributed to this dialogue that guided me and those who participated in this gathering over the years and who allowed to even think about ethic minority issues in psychology because my program at that time de-- we didn't talk about those issues. Uhm, it wasn't we weren't allowed to talk about these issues and when I raise those issues I was told that was something that I needed to go and deal with on my own. Uhm, it allowed me to begin to think about those issues who be-- allowed me to begin to think of myself as a Native-American psychologist and to think about the ways that I might be able to give back to those who would come after me. So it seems to me that the theme of this year's conference honoring our legacy and empowering future leaders is very important, and very complex. Honoring our legacy and empowering future leaders is more complex than it is initially sound and that I think can actually seem to thug, uhm, as in opposite directions at times. Sometimes we feel like in order to truly honor our legacy and, and keep the wisdom that has been handed down to us we have to fight to hold on, ah, to, to battle to ensure that those things don't get lost. And empowering our students to develop into leaders of the future actually means that we need to teach and then let go. And as I thought about this and the complexity is that what it means to empower-- and let me do reflect the great deal on my experiences, uhm, and things I've learned over the past years especially in terms of doing, uhm, disaster responds, uhm, in communities in trying to hope the communities to, to activate their natural healing responses, uhm, following something that seems to be devastating. So I'm gonna share these reflections and I hope they're, they're helpful to you. Uhm, several things have sort of come together in my experience lately that lead me to the ways that, ah, that I'm gonna be talking about this. Uhm, first there was an opportunity in the last couple of years to contribute a chapter to an amazing volume, uhm, released recently, published recently called, "Presumed incompetent". And intersection of raising class for women in academia. And it was, ah, collection of, of SA personal narratives of women in color-- wo-- women of color in academia. And this sort of started that reflective process because I, I started to think about what, what have I learned, uhm, how can I be helpful to the next generation of student in those becoming professionals. And since I still in the same department that I stared out and where I struggled and my, my colleagues and I struggled together to get through some of those very difficult dialogues, uhm, how could I convey those experiences without, uhm, undermining the experiences of my colleagues and my allies. The second thing that was sort of happening is my daughter has begun, uhm, a doctor program in Industrial Organizational Psychology this last year. And I've been learning to walk a very fine line between being a mom and being a professor. It's made me think lot about empowering and how easy it can become to quote, help someone which actually looks a little bit more like shaping them and what ends up to be our own image. Or even avoiding the problems that were, ah, relevant in our own experiences which it may not be the same thing that's needed. Uhm, the, the third thing that came together was this, this opportunity to speak at the, at the Winter Roundtable the place where these conversations really first began and beca-- became part of our professional, uhm, dialogue. And finally in, in upcoming change in leadership in my department is sort of requiring all of us to think about what we have to contribute wa-- how we might best participate and what we might want our legacy to be. And all of this is kind of laid on the foundation, uhm, what one of the great mentors in my life told me the very beginning of my career is really struggling to understand what wa-- what was I doing and how did I find myself in as a professor all of a sudden. Uhm, he told me, you know, it's really simple this is, ah, a native elder in my community and, uhm, he said, "It's really very simple. Your whole, your whole purpose in what you're doing is to learn about the gifts that you've been given and then figure out how to share those with the people." And as I think about-- and, and I been learning that was almost 20 years I was a little bit over 20 years ago and I've been learning all that time what that means and how important both parts of that are. Uhm, my gifts if I do discover them have a limited meaning unless I find some way of sharing them in ways that are meaningful to others, in ways that will empower them to contribute their own gifts as well. So, so all of this lead me to really think about what empowerment is and what it looks like. Interestingly, when you look up what is-- what are the essential elements of empowerment there is no real consensus about that, uhm, some definitions of empowerment seem to have in common that they focus on gaining power and control over resources and decisions that can determine the quality of once live. Some de-- definitions also take into account the structural inequities that in fact to all social groups. And some writers explore empowerment at the personal, relational or collective levels. But there are four elements that are often identified as being part of empowerment, access to information, inclusion of participation, accountability and local organizational capacity. What I think about these elements of empowerment I wonder if it fits within our cultural frameworks. Access to information implies that there's only one real truth, uhm, and that access to that information can be restricted or controlled but there is a correct way to look at things when in fact there are many ways. Inclusion of participation I think we always have had trouble with how-- who are we including and who are we living now. I'll say more about that in a minute. An accountability seems to imply that if you don't do it my way I'll take a way your power which means you weren't really empowering or being empowered in the first place at that-- it calls the mind conforming to certain standard to not being allowed to think in ways but are really true to, to your own self. And so I, I think accountability is often use in a way that tends to hold us down and not truly a power. And I would suggest that there responsibility is a different way of thinking about it and how we're responsible to those who come after us the things that we've been hearing and the, the powerful talks that we've heard already today. And local organizational capacity we need to think about who is the local organization and what is capacity? How were we defining capacity and now we're looking at that from the outside and deciding what the capacity is." Again it is, it's all culturally determined. These ideas about empowerment seem to emphasize power, control, access to resources and accountability when they're not the things that are, are central(ph) important that our cultural lives. How ideas of empowerment, uhm, how might they be different if we think about it from our culturally influence background. And how do we learn to both honor our legacies and become empowering to share our gifts. I know I here so many times from, ah, students have call her that our work with over the years is how do we hang on to who we are, how do we keep true to who we are where we come from. And those things that we want without losing ourselves and, and, and participate in, ah, this education that seems to be changing us. How do we do that without losing ourselves? Sometimes it's even led the students dropping out and going home because it felt like it had to be a to choice, it had to be an either or-- and as educators I wonder if we have failed to empower those students to be who they are, to become who they are becoming professionally and stay who they are, uhm, culturally. Ah, and I think that empowerment is allowing someone to have their own despect-- a prospective to, to find their own questions, to find their own solutions just as in communities, uhm, healing has to do with helping, ah, with, with what that community sees as the harm that has come. What has happened? How is it making the community unwell? What does the community think of as, as healing? What-- how does the community understand what health is or balance, or well being? And how do we change what we do to fit that? Ah, I'll say something about that in terms of, uhm, disaster work. First, how do we, ah, ah,-- so it seemed that empowerment-- I'm sorry I'm trying to I'm skipping it over some parts here. I think people have very well said, uhm, already today. Uhm, how do we really empower others then? Cuz it's seems to be that it's a duel challenge to both keep that wisdom and to share the gifts that we've given with others. So what is involve with keeping that wisdom. First we have to discover it, we have to be able to hear it that means we have to listen. And sometimes it's, it's suppose things but seem to be very small. Those insignificant things the things that can, uhm, fly by us and notice if we're not paying attention. It might be those things we've heard all our lives and don't, don't, ah, don't value until we become older. Uhm, but in, in our, our those-- it is those thin-- in all of those things, it is those things that have sustained our communities for generations. It's the lessons that have been passed down to us, uhm, by the once that have taken these path before us and we need to remember what that is that they've done. Sometimes we get caught in our own, ah, coming to understand what wa-- what our, our work is forget that many of people have laid the foundations for us to be there. So sometimes we have to really quiet ourselves and listen and remember and, and hear, uhm, those things that have been all around. And so it reminds me of, ah, in depression often you have, ah, ah, people monitor self about, ah, uhm, I'm sorry monitor positive events and it's not that, that positive things weren't happening all around them all the time it's that they'd hadn't notice them because of the depression. And so sometimes we have to look around ourselves and find that we do have the wisdom it has come to us from maybe it's our grandma, so maybe it's mentors or maybe it's our, uhm, colleagues. Next we have to understand the wisdom when we find it. We have recognize it as a when wisdom. The problem is that it often comes in the form of something we don't wanna hear, something we're not ready or something we just quite don't wanna know. Uhm, and that sometimes the more relevant it is to our life and our situation the more it is that we don't wanna know it. Then we have to be able to apply that wisdom to our own situation and the work that we do with others that wisdom is limited, uhm, e-- if it's not utilized. It, it has a limited value if it's not utilized in some real way. How do we make use of what someone else has, has passed on to it. Someone else has discovered. Someone else has worked on likely through their own suffering and sacrifice. And we have to hold on to it even in the face of hardship or adversity. Even when the path of le-- resistance would be to let it go by the way side. We need to recognize that someone else made the space for us to learn all of these. Someone empowered us for us to even-- someone empowered, ah, for us for to even be able to know this. And sometimes the hardest thing that we need to be able to do is to ask for help. That sometimes the wisest thing that we can do is to ask for help. The second half of that is sharing our gifts and we have to first find out what those are. We-- that often mean searching through painful, uhm, parts of our lives and knowing that being able to take from that those things that, that we have learned from that. Knowing that those gifts are there and having faith if you, if you, ah, can't seem to find them. Sometimes it means turning to others and letting them show you what those gifts are. It's-- now we have to figure out how to share those gifts in a way that is sharing and not dominating. Uhm, and in a way that doesn't enable or become somehow impressive to others. So we also need to, ah, I think Melba said is very, uhm, wonderfully this morning. We need to use our power wisely, uhm, we, we need-- it has to has to be some humility, uhm, some ways of being able to hear no matter what we discover that we have to share, we have to share in a way and with people who, who know what they need, who have the inherent strength to know what they want and what they need and if I force this great gift that I think I have that I think will be helpful on someone that's not really help given. So I think that we can, we can borrow from the International, uhm, Literature on Disaster Response which has had to take more of an indigenous approach over the years. Uhm, this comes from hundreds of, of disastrous situations where hundreds of thousands of people been affected and there's no possible way for a mental health professional-- or nor is there a need for mental health professional to see every single one of those people. And here in the United States it took us a longer to time to realize that, it took until we had, uhm, massive, ah, disasters and many people affected like 9/11 or the hurricanes, uhm, ah, ah, Katrina and the once that followed. Uhm, we've had to learned ways to truly empower people and communities, uhm, whose lives have been devastated and hope people to be able to take back the control of their lives at a time when it's very easy to foster defendants on outside resources. So, the inner agency standing committee of the United Nations has developed to set a guidelines for humanitarian aid workers working in international communities that I think could be very helpful as we think about, uhm, how do we empower, how do we empower our students to become future leaders the same way we empower, ah, communities who have, uhm, the strength and the intern that the resources to be able to set their own course. Some of the core principles that Inter-Agency Standing Committee takes. Uhm, the first is human rights and, and equity, it's about being inclusive, about being aware of the many ways that we can exclude and in disastrous situations we have realize the entering a community is in itself a political act. There are those voices that will be empower that will be, uhm, privilege over others and we have to take an active stands in, ah, in understanding whose voice is going to be heard and whose voice might not be heard. Uhm, and even when help is available it's not always accessible there's a different between what is available and accessible and how many times if we heard people who go to a community and say, what they have all this help here why aren't they utilizing it? It's because it's not available and accessible. And so, it must be done in a way that make sense to the community. So when we work with those students we need to think about these issues whose voices are we privileging and whose are would not. Uhm, How do we make ourselves both available and accessible in those services that might be there within our, our programs and our education settings. The second core principle of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee is participation. Uhm, key mental health and psychosocial supports need to come from within the affected community. Uhm, it will may-- we can bring sometimes in a disaster situation it's-- it we build compelled to bring help and to bring new things and they need this and they need that one really for those things to be sustainable they need to come from within the community. We cannot, uhm, empower communities if we're making them dependent on outside resources. And so the-- it all-- it's also about participation of everyone and with that participation we'll also come different groups and potential for completion between groups which is a natural thing and what we can do as outsiders is, uhm, empower by helping to ensure that all girls are heard the-- those conversations and the same as true for our students. The third, uhm, principle is to do no, no harm and that-- in a disaster situation that means that we understand than unintentional harm can happen and be very aware of the fact that, uhm, at that conn-- there are many ways that can happen. And this is especially hard to do in a disastrous situation because people are there because they want to help. And they are-- ah, it makes us less open to recognizing that maybe we are causing harm and what we are doing, uhm, by potentially maybe preventing certain voices, uhm, making sure, ah, that making sure that all voices are heard to those kinds of things. As it seems to me that at-- that's similar to working with our students we want to help, we want to mentor, we want to empower. And so we want to bring them along and to bring 'em into our family and take care of 'em but we have to be careful not to make them dependent. Because our whole point is to empower them to be able to access those internal resources and, uhm, go forward. It can cause unintentional harm by confusing or hurting, uhm, students along the way. The fourth, e-- uhm, principle is building on the available resources and capacities. In disaster that means recognizing those strengths knowing that no matter how devastated this community is there are strengths there. This is the very fact that the community is still there tells us that it has strength and resilience it has survive all these years it has survive whatever this disaster is. And we need to recognize those strengths are there. We also need to recognize the people need to feel, ah, powerful and affective and that may not, ah, they may turn to behaviors and, and I, and I see this sometimes for students they may turn to behaviors in order to feel powerful and effective because as students I think you inherently don't feel very powerful a lot of times and that so we need to help them see that those, those the-- those activities that they turn to feel the effect before their new as students may not be the once that will help 'em along their, their new path. And so, helping is-- helping to strengthen the resources that are already present, uhm, but helping to make-- to give them experiences of that effectiveness and their, their new role as, as students or their, their early-- their-- yes, new role. I'm sorry. Uhm, I'm trying to picture, I'm, uhm, staying on time here. Integrated, uhm, ingratiated support systems is the, uhm, the 5th core principle of the IASC and that is, uhm, building targeted supports, uhm, can often make for a fragmented system so after a disaster on many times you will see here's a specific group for, for example women who been sexually assaulted and here's another specific group for, uhm, people with the specific diagnosis maybe PTSD. And instead of thinking about how to build into-- in a more integrated support system instead of sort of patchwork of fragmented support systems to think about building community supports and personal supports that are integrated and more holistic. And we can really think about that with our work with students and empowering them so that the system of support that we build for them is not that path work it's more holistic overall, ah, integrated kind of support system. Uhm, how do we help for example students build that balance life that, ah, Melba Vasquez is talked about this morning how to build that balance between work and, and professional life and think about how putting together a support system that takes a look at that big picture rather than, than, ah, actually contributing to that, that fragmentation. And finally the, the last, ah, core principle of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee is multi-layered supports. Uhm, supports need to be multi-layered in o-- order to help people who are affected in a variety of different ways and in a disaster it maybe that there's some, some people who just need to have their basic needs to meet. There are maybe some people who need more family and community kinds of supports and there may be some people who need very specialized mental healthcare. When we build that support system we need to make sure if we're going to empower that community we need to make sure that all of those different kinds of needs are met that, that's-- that support system is multi-layered and we need to think about that with our, with our students as well that one kind of mentoring is not going to cover all of the needs of all of our students. Some students are going to need, uhm, more basic, uhm, skills and others are gonna need more specialize to help in, in certain areas. And the same student may need different kinds of support at different times in there-- in their (inaudible ). So we need to be able to think about how to be-- have that flexibility as we empower, uhm, those that we seek to help. Uhm, so for those of us who, who hope to empower we need to find ourselves enrolls where we think of what we're doing as facilitating, guiding, mentoring, strengthening, listening, encouraging, building capacity, collaborating, expanding opportunity and we need to be those of us who try to empower we need to be stay in the background allowing others to lead, pushing others up to be the best that they can be. Taking care not to try to mold and our hold it-- ah, in our own image. Uhm, making space, collaborating and helping people become who they are. So empowerment I think is about the idea that power can change it can expand its more about power with as supposed to power over or for taking power it shared the power. It's bringing power which is different than giving power. If we give power we're already in trouble with what it is that we're doing. We need to understand that power is relational, it's not giving power as much at is sharing power. So empowerment focuses on strengths, provides opportunities and resources to gain experiences and skills and provide support from people to become themselves for our students to become who they are going to be. Empowerment is a process that fosters power in people for use in their own lives communities and society by acting on issues that they define as important. I just happen to be I'll admit it listening to QVC the other day and Tony Robbins was, uhm, selling his, ah, ah, a collection of, uhm, DVDs I think and he just happen to say something that as I was thinking about these things that really caught my ear, "The ultimate gift in life is giving people to ability to maximize who they are, what they're capable of and what they're about." And that's empowerment. So we teach and we let go. Uhm, native elders have said, that when we give a gift we give it away. When we share our gifts with those that, uhm, will be the leaders of the future we give those gifts away. We give the best that we have. We don't attach any strings to it. We don't takes back to anything in return for it and we give it fully and completely. And when we truly give those gifts we expand them, we expand those gifts to the act of giving them away. So, we empower those future leaders to discover the gifts that they've given so that they can make their own special contributions to the world. And that's my reflections on the, the theme of this conferences here and it's been an honor to contribute to that. I hope that those reflections, uhm, are helpful as we go forward that to think about it empowering. Thank you.
