Lessons Learned: Understanding the Meaning of Internationalizing Counseling Psychology (CP) Changming Duan University of Kansas 

00:02:05
I Want to Share with you: 1) Thoughts and observations (clinical and empirical) based on: -My limited understanding of counseling theories and practices in the United States. -My personal experiences from the involvement in training and research in China. 2) Some empirical findings and a proposed theory about counseling in China. 3) My goal - to stimulate your thinking as we are all trying to figure out how to internationalizing CP 

00:02:05
Internalization Movement in Counseling Psychology Background: - It is historically destined: CP has become an international phenomenon - Much efforts and investments from the United States - By "Internationalization" the direction from the United States (or other European countries) to developing countries is often implied or most thought of. 

00:02:05
Summary by Heppner (2008): Contributing factors: - 1) cultural, social, economical, political and environmental events and forces; 2) Pioneering and persistent efforts of the individual scholars to conceptualize and articulate the utility of internationalizing counseling psychology; 3) The growing number of voices with international experiences in U.S. Counseling psychology; 4) Structural changes our professional organizations that promote cross-cultural perspective; 5) pioneering efforts of individuals in leadership positions to promote cultural perspectives in the specialty. 

00:02:05
Leaders of the Internationalization Movement in CP Louise Douce - 2003 President of Society of CP Puncky Heppner - 2005 President of Society of CP Roberta Nutt - 2006 President of Society of CP Stewart Cooper, Carolyn Enns, & Larry Gerstein - initiated and International Forum at APA (2003) Society of Vocational Psychology held the first International conference in Coimbra, Portugal (2003) Linda Forrest - 2008 President of SCP and held the first International Conference of CP (with scholars from over 40 countries) in Chicago. 

00:02:05
Other Reasons for the Movement Rich human resources in the US: a large number of theorists, researchers, and practitioners of CP. Rich intellectual resources in the US: large size and high quality of the literature. Influence of the multicultural movement in our filed. Warm reception of international communities - Rising needs for counseling profession due to western influence. - "Learning from experts" mentality in many cultures 

00:02:05
Internationalizing: A noble and rewarding cause We have a lot to offer. We feel good to offer. HOWEVER... - How to define and decide what we have achieved that is worth sharing? - How to evaluate the fit of what is being transplanted and the cultural soil? - What is our responsibility to ensure "do no harm?" 

00:02:05
My personal effort Volunteered to teach, conducted research, and offered clinical consultation in China for past 10 years Only recently, I, I started to seriously reflect ... and felt surprised by my own discoveries and observations. I am just beginning to understand the meaning of internationalization of counseling psychology... 

00:02:05
What I have learned: We are facing a "reality" - --In many ways, we failed in serving ethnic, social and cultural minorities in the United States -Evidence: under utilization of counseling process; lack of trust of counseling process; over diagnosis and racial/ethnic minority representation in prison,... The current power structure -Who sets standards, who evaluates, who is on top of the hierarchy in "international collaborations" 

00:02:05
Meet the Challenge Seriously examine our willingness in power sharing Serious work in de-constructing, relearning, and transforming in -1) How we see and present ourselves Sense of superiority -2) What we teach, research and practice Un-intentionally we are showing Americanism, Westernism, or enthnocentralism 

00:02:05
What I learned, con't About myself and what I have done because I did not really understand HOW -I represent "US counseling psychologists" through teaching US theories and practices (unexamined for cultural relevance) -Contributed to the internalized ethnocentralism among Chinese scholars and students (through showing my power and confidence) -Contributed to "American is better." 

00:02:05
What I have learned, con't Counseling and counseling psychology development in China - Many practitioners are not appropriately trained .... Nonetheless, these non-trained professionals fill a societal need in some significant ways and there is no clear evidence to say that they are not always effective. _ Many practicing counselors and graduate students are well read on western traditional counseling and personality theories. However, few know much about multicultural counseling theories. 

00:02:05
Counseling and counseling psychology development in China Many are well informed in terms of how powerful and how scientific many of these theories are, few know they have been critiqued by multicultural theorists and researchers There is really thirst for "advanced skills" in counseling in China, among trained or untrained professionals. Research in counseling psychology is having a slow start - it is hard to get recognition either from the scientific fields in China or from the United States. 

00:02:05
Some observations that are concerning to me: Internalized ethno-centralism. Using European Americans' evaluation as criteria for judgment in their self evaluation. Showing respect, admiration, and even deference for "foreign scholars" or "foreign experts" - often perceived as weak, not knowing, being behind, ...They do feel this way! 

00:02:05
Observations concerning to me: Scholars & researchers are not well informed of multicultural theories - This shows what has been brought to China by "foreign experts" and who hold the power in deciding what is important for China. The belief that "American is better" or "American way is advanced " is very clearly shown through policies and funding decisions at various levels of the hierarchy in the academy or in the administration. "Shorten the distance between us and the West" has been a motivating factor in many areas, but it may point in a wrong direction for the development of counseling in China. 

00:02:05
What we need to do: First and foremost - internationalization is not just exporting our theories and practices to different countries or for helping others. Leung et al. (2009): Internationalization of counseling should be a "process if integrating knowledge from research and practice derived from different cultures" and it "involves collaboration and equal partnerships where cultural sensitivity and respect are necessary for success." Our theories and practices need renewal (through internationalization), especially in addressing cultural issues. 

00:02:05
Specifically, we need to: 1. Adopt a worldview that acknowledges the uneven distribution of power, both politically and professionally, and the impact of it on our self perception of others in our international communities. 2. Recognize our sense of superiority and the privilege we have simply because we work and live in the United States. 

00:02:05
We need to: 3. Develop a willingness to share power. If we can be as open as our international colleagues in "learning from others" and value their work 4. Acknowledge the ethnocentrism reflected by our theory and practice and our attitudes and perceptions about ourselves and others. We tend to judge the practices of others that are inconsistent with ours as bad, inferior, or even wrong. 

00:02:05
We need to: 5. Become multiculturally competent and sharpening our own skills in multicultural understanding before going international! 6. Root our efforts in specific cultures and let knowledge be generated from within - we have to allow it. 

00:02:05
Internationalization of CP True internationalization will not happen unless we are willing to share power and make genuine effort in respecting and learning from our international partners, no matter where in the world they are. 

00:02:05
An empirical attempt to study counseling in China A basic skill of counseling we teach - "not to tell clients what to do" The long term debate of counselor directive use in US Caution about the use -Inconsistent with the value of independence, autonomy, ... "Directive-implementation-outcome" Problem solving focus directives Avoid it to be a counselor's agenda We conducted a field study of counseling process and outcome and two qualitative studies 

00:02:05
Some empirical findings: 1. Counselors reported giving fewer directives than clients reported receiving. 2. A large proportion of directives reported by clients are not deemed as directives per common definitions. 3. Implementation does not predict outcome 4. Quantity of directives predicts outcome & working alliance. 

00:02:05
CHANGMING DUAN Thank you Melanie. Um, hi everyone. Uh, as I look around I see a lot of young faces, which is very, very nice, uh, cause you are all the future of counseling psychology on this land and maybe, in some ways, you'll be involved in, um, in the international communities as well. So, um, glad to see you all. Um, I'm going to share with you some, um, some of my thoughts and learning experiences over the last, maybe, 10 years, um, through doing some of the international work. Um, as Melanie introduced, I came from China so I have this passion, you know, for wanting to see how, um, um, the, our international community. Um, use counseling and use (Inaudible ) as a helping profession. Um, but over the years, I have to say, on the broader term is that I've become, um, each time, because I visit China regularly. Each time I become less talkative, more hesitant to give lectures and to teach. Um, I become more and more humble. Part of the reason is due to some of the observations and the thoughts, um, I've developed over the years so I want to share those with you. Um, I, I want to set the perimeters so that my experiences, what I share here is really based on my limited understanding of counseling psychology, on counseling constant psychology in the United States and, um, my personal experiences for the work with, uh, uh, involvement in training and researching China. And also, if I have time at the end, I want to share with you some of the empirical findings and, and a proposed theory about counseling in China if I, I hope I can get to that point. I'll run fast to, to get to that point. That's the fun part. Um, my goal is really not teach, not to teach you anything. It's basically simulating your own thinking. Internationalization has become a movement in some ways. And, you know, but, I think this is still new and there's a lot of, um, areas we really haven't given much thought. So we really need to think through what we're doing. So I work, that's my goal, to simulate your thinking. Having said that, I hoe you feel comfortable to interrupt me to, when you have questions or have comments. We can have dialog. Of course I'll try to, um, give you a few minutes at the end to ask questions but during the presentation, feel free to jump in. Just raise your hand. This is more than enough room so, which is good. When I teach, um, I always tell students, if you find my, if you find me talking too much, more than 20 minutes, stop me. Because I want to hear what you have to say. Okay, give a little bit of background. I'll run this, uh, fast. Um, in, in some ways, going beyond the borders, or counseling psychology go international, um, is unavoidable, is (Inaudible ) destined. Just look at our world. And our world has become smaller. Um, the nations and people become more and more connected. So that's part of that, that process and I think it is unavoidable. So, um, our profession has responded, has responded by some people, some individual, um, leaders and, uh, researchers, practitioners trying their own way to respond to this demand in the international community to share with the world what we know. Um, so those efforts actually really paying, um, that's, that's what lead us to where we are at this point. However, I want to point out, I don't know if you feel this way, generally when we talk about internationalization, the direction is always from United States or other western countries to developing countries. And I think it's, it's not clearly stated but it's implied in the often times it's thought of. When we talk about international we think, okay, lets go somewhere to do something for them. So that's basically where we are at this point. Um, there's some contributing factors to this development. You know, I'm not trying to say that this development (Inaudible ) significant that, as I said, it's become a movement to go beyond the borders, go international. And some contributing factors. Um, one is cultural, social, economical, political and environmental events that, and forces of course that, that lead to us to this place. I'm not going to elaborate because it's pretty apparent. And I also want to point out, it's pioneering and persistent efforts of the individual scholars. They've done a lot of work. Since probably 30's and the 40's we have counseling psychologists, um, going abroad to offer their service to the need of the international community. And there's, um, in our field, there's a growing number of voices with international experience the US started a few, maybe one or two decades ago and it's getting higher and higher, their voice. And as the structure changes in our program, professional organization you are probably all aware division 17, society of counseling psychology establish international section maybe five or six years ago. So those all contributed, uh, to, to, and then of course the leaders and the individual have contributed to the movement. Um, I want to point out a few leading figures, um, in the counseling psych area, uh, in our field that have made a significant contribution. Uh, Louise Douce was the President of Division 17 in 2003 and she was the first one to, um, uh, use globalization as a central theme for her presidential initiative. Then following her was Puncky Heppner in 2005 and he also, uh, focused his presidential, um, initiative, um. International, internationalizing counseling psychology. Roberta Nutt, the 2006 President of, uh, Society of Counseling Psych, psych. She also did quite a lot of work in internationalizing counseling psychology. And then they have a few people, the, um, Stewart Cooper, Carolyn Enns and Larry Gerstein. They initiated the International Forum at APA in 2003. That really, um, get attention of a lot of counseling psychologists started thinking about internationalizing. Um, Society of Vocational Psych did, um, you know, they did quite a work and then they did international conferences as early as, uh, 2003. Linda Forrest, um, you probably all know, Linda Forrest did a tremendous amount of work during her presidency as a Division of 17, or, um, Division 17 Society of Counseling Psychology. She organized the first international conferences in Chicago in counseling psychology in Chicago. And we have, um, representatives of over 40 countries attending that conference. So this is all the significant, um, uh, all the leaders did a significant work. Um, and there are other reasons for why this movement at this time. Uh, I think the first one is the rich human resources we have. You know, the, as I said, when we talk about internationalism, it's more like talking about we or those of us who are in the United States go abroad to do some work. So, because we do have that human resources, no other countries has this large number of professionals. Theorists, researchers and, um, practitioners. And we also have, um, a rich intellectual resources, as a result of the effort over the decades of, in our history, of counseling psych. Um, we have built the largest size of literature and the quality is internationally recognized as high. That's good. In fact, many countries use it as a, use a lot of the standard we use here as their standard. So those really, um, position us in a place where, yes, we can go to, um, off of something outside the United States. Um, and also I want to point out the influence of multicultural movement in our field. And in the last few, the, the full force of counseling psychology, the last few decades, a lot of scholarship and work has been done in the area of multicultural counseling. And I have to say, um, that movement really laid a foundation for us to even think about doing international work. And I also want to gently point it out that sometimes because multicultural counseling, when you get into that area, it can be difficult because emotionally, um, relevant for all of us. I, um, when I teach multicultural class, I always tell students is that it's, it's a lot easier for us to understand our clients, empathize with our clients when the issues, when the reason for their struggle had nothing to do with us. You know, in other words, if you have a client who had an eating disorder because of some complex, you know, complex situations early childhood that led to, her to, uh, develop an eating disorder. And I think it's easier to really empathize and put ourselves in their shoes, to walk in their shoes, uh, in the process of walking with them. But when the clients, their, their experiences, especially negative experiences is, is, is related to some factors, um, to which we are associated with or maybe we're part of it, we're part of the problem, that is in the, you know, interracial, racial relationship. If we, when we work with people of diverse backgrounds, especially in ethnic interracial cultural background, and we part of their experiences, whether or not we stand on their side or the different side or whether or not, where we position ourselves, we are part of the experiences. Sometimes it's hard, it's more challenging. So emotionally it could create some challenge for us. And I, I have to say, there are times that people thinking, wow, maybe going abroad, you know, I'm doing this kind of multicultural work in an international context feels safer. Because of distance, our involvement in the experiences is not as, um, not as, um, obvious. So, I think think that in some ways, the influence of multicultural movement on internalization movement is real interesting to explore. There are, um, different types of influence available. And another important factor is the warm reception of international communities. Now, recently years, we all noticed, um, almost is a westernization. You talk about globalization, to a large degree there's a westernization among a lot of developing countries. As the result, the need for professional counseling seems to arise in other countries. There's many countries that have never heard about, uh, professional counseling prior to we introduce what we know as professional counseling to them. Right, I think many of you have some experiences. You know, I grown up in China. All those years, the years I spent in there, I didn't see any need for any professional counseling. But now, situations are different because of westernization of the culture. So the warm reception from international, uh, community, and for a number of reasons, one is because the need is arising. This is new and the other is this, um, hierarchy empower. People tend to, uh, value learning from something. You know, United States, we have big literature, lot of people are willing to do this work. We have theories. We have practices. We have systems. So, often times they say, well, they scramble to try to find something to be able to utilize and right at this moment, as the need just arise. There's no, um, long time preparation on their part. So that they do, um, receive us very warmly. And know those of you who have attempted to do international work, you feel very rewarded when you go. Even, when I went back to China to teach the first time 10 years ago, um, I feel very funny but on, on one hand I really enjoyed a warm reception. And I feel myself, oh, why? Do you have something to offer. Almost like an expert. And they do treat me as an expert but something was funny. I couldn't really put my fingers on it until recently years. I'll share with you what I discovered in that self reflection. So, in terms of doing international work, it is a noble and rewarding cause, right. So, if you go to any country, especially those countries who are, who are so thirsty for new knowledge, something counseling, professional counseling psychology, it's something you, we have this (Inaudible ) to present because we have done a lot of research. Um, so that feels good. So we have a lot to offer and feel good to offer. However, what I want to point out is that, how to define and decide, we will have achieve that is worth sharing with them. How do we define that? How do we, think about it. I actually spent a lot of time thinking about it. That's one of the reasons, when I, uh, go back to China, I break my classes. The first time I taught, I was at 300 students in the class. Then I have a hundred. Now, this time, this past fall when I went back, I insisted, break them into smaller groups. I meet with, uh, 15 at a time and I meet morning, afternoon, evening. I break them so they can have conversation going on because I don't feel comfortable go to speak in a lecture hall to teach. Um, for that reason is because I'm not sure what is worth sharing and I need to check that out. And do you evaluate the fit of what is being transplanted and cultural soil? How many of you have been thinking about it? We all know what's the right thing to say. Like I went, the first day I went to China, I told them, you know what I'm telling you is gonna be, you know, rooted in the western culture and we need to think about Chinese culture. We need to think about adapting. We need to think about reconstructing. We need to think. I, now that I look back, it was no more than a lip service because I really didn't understand how culture, how big, how significant a roll the culture has played when you move something from one cultural environment to a ecologically, culturally, entirely different, um, ground. So, that, I said those things. I didn't mean anything not mean much to me. Not mean much to them either. So, we need to think of what is our responsibility to, to ensure do no harm. I have to say, sometimes I get depressed and when I look back at what some of the things I have done, like if I thought it was a noble, good things done, but when I look back, I'll tell you example a little later, is I feel a little depressed about that. Um, so let me just, I already mentioned what I have done. In the last 10 years, I kind of volunteered to do some teaching and, I do have research projects going on which is very exciting. And I offer clinical consultations, uh, for the last 10 years. But only recently, I started to seriously reflect and I felt surprised by my own discoveries and observation. That's what I'm going to share with you. And I'm beginning to understand the meaning of internationalization of counseling psychology. I didn't think I understood then, now look back. What I have learned, one thing I have learned, which is hard for us to accept, is we're facing a reality. What is this reality? I don't know, I, I think people, a lot of people will disagree with me but I'm, that I'm convinced is this in many ways, we as counseling psychologists, we as a counseling profession, we have failed in our history in serving ethnic, social and cultural, um, minorities in the United States. I know that not every one agree with me but that's one of my convictions after studying and teaching classes this many years. And we all know, if we are not part of a solution to a problem, we're the problem. And, in what ways, that we have contributed to some of the social oppression that, um, minority people experience in society. This is, in some ways, hard for us to swallow but I think that we can't just ignore it. We have to think about it, explore it, uh, examine it. And there is, uh, evidence, research evidence, under utilization of minorities. What, I mean the under utilization of counseling by minority folks. Why? We're not helping them. Uh, over diagnosis of minority folks. This is empirical findings have established this. And lack of trust from minority folks towards counseling process as well as counselors. And, you know, you all know the prison population. Uh, there's over representation of ethnic minorities. So this is really showing that we are not really helping them in the way they deserve. So we failed as a profession. This is hard to swallow but I, I think we do need to think about it before we go. Because, um, we are trying to internationalize something that has already failed on our own land. So in our effort, if we don't pay attention to what failed, what led to the failure, how can we introduce something or help them with the way, the way in which that's fair and just. And what I also point out is the, uh, current power structure. Who sets the standards? Who evaluates? Who is on top of the hierarchy in international collaborations? You know, um, a lot of folks have great heart and good intentions when he started doing this but because the interactions between our communication style, their communication style and our understanding what we are teaching. What we are preaching. Often times that, we are theirs. Just like, we're the ones who set a standard, who evalues. What is good, what is not good, what is quality work. I'll be a little bit more specific. Is that, um, because of that, cause we have more power in the international community, now (Inaudible ) than anyone else. When I say we, I mean those of us who come from the United States or some of European countries. When we speak, people think that that's the standard, that's the right thing. So that's, um, uh, um, one of the areas I learned and I started thinking about. Now how do we meet this challenge? Um, we need to seriously examine our willingness in power sharing. In power, who has the power? How do we share power? And I think it's critical. My personal conviction is that until we are willing to share power, there's no true internationalization. There's some of the efforts, including my own, and I don't know if, I want to say, cause I, I thought I did more harm than good. I'll tell you a specific example later. It's because I was going there to promoting counseling psychology as I know that has been in practice in, in United States. Even if I preface it with some warning signs. But I really didn't address the issue to the degree that makes sense to everybody, to both, to them or to me. So, I think that's something we just have to do is that we have to do some serious reconstructing, uh, or de-constructing, relearning and transformation. (Inaudible ) I think that there's two areas is one, transforming how we see ourselves. Two is how we see what we teach. And I think there's two things, and I've been thinking a lot about it. You know, I actually have the face of Chinese. I'm Chinese. I speak the language. I'm fluent in their culture. And I go there, it's just because I have a degree from United States. I have a job in United States. And I'm treated as a expert. So, without my intention, the sense of superiority was in me. I have to say, when I started teaching, you know, even if I, you know, spoke broken language, when I, um, taught psychology courses my Chinese was not good enough. It's because I learned everything the concept in the United States. That say, already says something. I don't even have the correct words to use to make sense to my Chinese colleagues and students. But I had this confidence and this feel superior because I do come from this background. And what we teach, this also another area is, we need to think about, you know, often times, unintentionally, we are showing some of this Americanism, you know, Westernism and, and ethnocentrism. There's no question about it. Because we're teaching a way of approaching counseling, a way of thinking. How do we do research? How do we do practice? How do we started establishing this as a profession. Now lets look, now I also learned something about myself. What I have done. You know, I hinted a little bit, um, because I did not really understand how to do the international work. And I think that I represent US counseling psychologists when I go there. I teach US theories and practices, unexamined for cultural relevance. And I contributed to the internalized ethnocentralism among Chinese scholars and students. Because there does, because I do hold power, uh, or not I, us, all of us. We hold power. And I have to say when I went back this time, it pains me to hear some of the universities, top universities, really (Inaudible ) universities, they have new standard for new faculty, for system professors to, uh, if you want to be promoted, um, continue in a promotion to become associate professor. You have to have a article published in United States or other European countries, which really pains me. Because, from my observation, you know, my, my involvement with this one program, one area, the research is pretty deep so I know there is students I have communicate. From my observation, they're doing such quality work. They do very good work in terms of research, in terms of counseling. They're doing significant, um, uh, work over there. But then, who sets the standard for (Inaudible ). And they internalized this ethnocentric type of thinking is they're thinking, this is the standard. So, that really pains me and I think part of it is because all those foreign experts, me included, we went back to teach, to preach in some ways. And, of course, American is better, that's something. Um, I'm not saying this praise that America is better is right, in some areas maybe we do, we do have a lot of things that are more advanced than they do, um. But not in counseling. Not in counseling psychology. I have to say, this is completely cultural rooted, cultural bound phenomenon. Not in this area. And I also, um, have learned, um, some things about the counseling and counseling psychology development in China. Um, one thing is interesting. I reacted to it very differently 10 years ago than now. In China, many of the counselors, they're not, um, systematically trained. They didn't go through a training. And I think the certificate, they don't call license, they call certificate, for practice is issued by a Ministry of Labor. So you can, you can tell who I am involved in gate keeping or quality assurance. Um, so they have, uh, the one time, um, when, I don't know now how many books, they have few books. They have to read those books, take a test and get a certificate and then you can go to open shop to do counseling. I really, uh, thought, well that's terrible. However, when we do that, perhaps it is terrible. I don't know. I, I don't know the degrees which, you hear bad stories and good stories. What I want to say is that, we don't have evidence to judge. That your system is completely out of, does not work. Think about it. A time when we realize, when people in China realize that they need counseling. Where do we get counselors? Where are trained counselors? Right? We don't have those. They fill a social function, the social need. And we do not have empirical evidence to really show everyone is terrible. In fact, out of those stories, I have heard a lot of good stories. And I've met some people who didn't have any training, they were great counselors. Of course, the way they do counseling is very different from what we do, from the way we do counseling. but nonetheless, they serve a function and they helped. Especially in a time the nation, the culture needs that kind of help. So that is something I, you know, I learned and I think it's really helped me to do more self-examination when I, and when I'm about to articulate my advice. When I first went back, I didn't hesitate. And I think, that's terrible, this terrible. I remember coming back telling a, a colleague, I said, oh gosh, I saw this counselor. This one counselor, I want to say, this is a good case, uh, study. She, she's about my age but she started, she was, um, in China before, she went to college. Studied political science. She was, uh, we call a political instructor. Basically, it's like, um, the, like an administrative instructor, student affair person for the students. That kind of roll. It's called a political instructor at that time. So, when counseling started to emerge, she thought, well I don;t want to be doing this. I want to do counseling. So she just gave them, you know, that she's very well educated, a very, um, had a great heart. A very warm, nice, good people skills. So she came over to the counseling center so they allowed her to do the counseling. When the first time I went back, I was so surprised. I saw, people would travel. They would take a train for four , five hours on a Friday afternoon come to see her. She was heavily sought after by clients. But when I observed her practice, I was really shocked. The way she did counseling was not how we see counseling needs to be done. You know, she'll tell a youngster say, you know, you think your mom, you know, you're angry at your mom. You think your mom tells you. No. I know. Your mom really loves you. You shouldn't do this. You should do this, this, this to make her feel happy for instance. Okay. So this is something, I almost had a heart attack. That's not counseling, right. We shouldn't do that. Now, nonetheless, think about the social and cultural structure. If you, I, I remember, use this example, is that, when we talk about counseling here, we should help you to get in touch with your feelings and emotions. One of the things we talk about, when Albert Alice talked about, yeah, it's not the end of the world even if you feel angry at your mother. I remember feeling, you know, for me, that is the end of the world. In my life. I was in forties when I hear this. You know, it just, my cultural environment, not only external pressure. If I'm angry at my mother, acting out my anger or whatever, not only the external, I could not live with myself. It's me growing up in that culture. I was, you know, educated to be a good daughter, to be a good wife, good family. It's so important in my personal identity. And, of course, I'm part of my mother. My mother is a part of me. It's how we see ourselves. So in that environment, if you help them to really get in touch with their anger, what are you, what are you doing for them? Right? So I think of this, you can not leave the culture. So what she did then, I thought, you know, terrible but she was very effective. There's so many people, she couldn't, you know, uh, um, see all the clients and she had to convince them to see a practicing students. Now a few years later, now that's why I think it's, um, this is a lesson. She, of course, that's where, the China Central Normal University, that's where probably the only really, um, training program called counseling psychology training program, is there. Is, they have masters and Ph.D. Programs. So they have a lot of, and most of, of course, most of theorists, these studies, from translated books. And all their students are very fluent English. Click of mouse, we can see all the literatures we can see here plus their Chinese literature. So they have actually more resources than we do in terms of intellectual, um, uh, resources (Inaudible ) resources. So, um, the training started, then this person, of course, she feel, she told me she feel very inferior. Especially when I want to teach all this as she felt I didn't receive any formal training so she. I really want to be good. So, from that point on she would go to every foreign experts lectures, training. She sought out a lot, uh, training, informal trainings because she was already, uh, in faculty. She can not go to graduate school but she sought out all of the training. Now this time, 10 years has spanned I saw her, you know, (Inaudible ). Now, when I went back, actually pains me. I said, we didn't do you good. She completely felt what she did was not acceptable. She's not herself. Her practice sounds awkward when she see clients. Because what she did was so looked down upon. People said negativities about her. So she tried to disown that part of her. She was just not authentic when she was in the sessions. And she's no longer that popular. You know, the (Inaudible ) Counseling Center, this is funny system they do, is they put all the counselors name on the board so clients can pick which one you want to see. And you really wait for, in a long line. Cause some people have long lines and some people don't have wait list. So her lines getting shorter and shorter. So are we doing the good or harm? You know. I can't help to think. You know. So that's why I also, my discoveries shocked myself. Um, as a little bit more is that, uh, another phenomenon that, you know, there, there's something in Chinese interesting that all students are very well informed. Very, I'm saying, very well informed in terms of counseling theories, of Western counseling theories. And I think, when I compare their, their understanding with our current students, I think they do better job. Cause they have their English text, version of text, they have their Chinese version, they have different translations and they kind of. In fact, in Chinese, this is a different learning style. They really focus on the principle theory. They really chew it, understand every word of it. So I think they are more articulate than many of our students in terms of those theories. But few will know anything about multicultural counseling theories. Because they didn't think that's Relevant. Because those of us who go there to preach didn't bother to inform them. So that, I thought was real interesting. Um, and there is really thirst for advanced skills. They keep thinking U.S., U.S. You must have a lot of advanced skills. And we want to learn their skills to counsel. You know, I, I'm looking at, where did you get that perception? I'm telling the students, if you can use those basic skills to solve complex problems, you're probably very successful. Again, it is we who built that expectation in them. Because we come as experts, we teach you something new each time. So they, they have that expectation. Also, research, research in counseling really, really has a slow start. Um, part of the reason is recognition is very hard to gain recognition for counseling research. So I know, basically for process outcome research for instance, the Central Normal University probably they only place the graduate students and the faculty. they're doing this and they're doing fabulous work in that area. But the recognition is hard for both China and United States. Okay, let me just list a few things that I'm, uh, uh, um that really concern, my observation concern me. One is internalized, um, ethno-centralism and using Euro-Americans' evaluation standard or criteria for judging themselves. Um, they do show respect, admiration, even deference to foreign scholars and foreign experts. Often times that are viewed by us as weak or behind or not good. Cause you are so eager to learn from us. So we need to be very careful. Um, and also as I mentioned, is that they're not familiar with our multicultural literature. That is, um, a important issue for us to pay attention to. Um, American is better. That's a, and shorten the distance between us and Western countries. That has been a slogan for China in many, many areas. But I don't think that it applies, or should be applied to this, to counseling and counseling psychology. Um, so I'm going to skip some slides. What I think we need to do. First and foremost, internationalization is not just exporting our stuff to others. Right? So right now, when we talk about internationalization, often times we think about what we can do for international company to help us. In fact, from the multicultural literature we can tell our theories and practices really need renewal and need to be further developed and advanced so that we can understand the roll of culture. We haven't done a good job in that area. Internationalization can provide input in our self improvement. So we need to understand that, internationalization is not just go to help others, to teaching the other countries. Um, so Leung has a definition really really emphasized, um, this two way street. Specifically, I think one thing we, we need to do is adopt a worldview that acknowledges an uneven distribution of power, both politically and professionally, and the impact of it on our self perception and perception of others. We also need to recognize our sense of superiority. Often times we are not intentional in portraying us as experts, as superior. But the way we do it really, I, that's, for me, that's. You know, I go there. They say, okay, I can teach you this, this, this, as if they don't know. I never, you know, spent time there to really listen what they had know, what kind of material, uh, understanding of this process. They have been practicing. There's so many thousands, thousands, thousands of counselors are practicing. The complaints, yeah, there are complaints but they're very few. Do they do, there's something working there. We also need to develop a willingness to share power as I said. I know, like I say, I said, you're unrealistic. You require every assistant professor have something published in the United States. Do you know how hard it is to publish in the United States? It's not because they have quality of work. It's because many, many other reasons. Of course, one, perhaps, is language. Also, the presentation style is (Inaudible ). They're all very different. It's not a (Inaudible ). As I observe, they do marvelous job in some of the research but. And the bottom line is, you think about it. How many of us, or how many of the people that are doing international work, they really speak their language but they, all our international collaborators, they speak their own language and English. So they can appreciate (Inaudible ) our literature but we can not understand their literature. So this is the issue. Become multiculturally competent. Doing international work should not, will not, or should not be considered as a substitute for doing some serious, difficult multicultural competent development for, in ourselves. So I think. And we should root our efforts in specific cultures and allow the knowledge and theories being generated from the within. We have to allow it. Right now, we think our theory is so power, we go everywhere to teach and we haven't really listened to their theories. It's very different. Um, so we need to share power, the bottom line. I don't have time to share with you my research findings but I want to be really quick saying I did a study about, a serious study, two or three studies on directive use. All the counselors, as you said in the example, is that we told them, yeah, first thing you do is don't tell clients what to do. Well, that's part of the culture. If you don't tell, you're not doing your work. No, no, no. You shouldn't do it. So last time I went back I was so surprised. I asked people, you know, how many (Inaudible ) you do give directives, the doctors and students doing counseling. None of them wanted to own that I give directives. Because that's not right. But on the other hand, I heard so many stories. A therapist will feel so good if they were able to give them brilliant directive or suggestion (Inaudible). You feel so good about your session. And more, yeah, is the clients. The clients do say, I know you can not tell us what to do but can you please don't tell your supervisor? Can you please give me a idea about? So the clients often reported feel, oh gosh, you can get, if a counselor gave a directive, oh my gosh, I love you. This great. You can tell me. Because they heard the counselor's not suppose to give directives. That's what we, uh, we've been teaching. So it's really interesting how empirical finding does show that the, um. You know, we interviewed them after the (Inaudible) study too is that, it's not a matter of whether or not we should give directive, it's a matter of how. And the given director is communicate different things. Not, Like we try to replicate American studies like focusing on what I tell you to do and you do what I say. No, that''s not it. The type of directives you give are different. We're not so much interested in, you know, you go home, do this. And we're more interested in to provide you with a perspective, some wisdom. You know, people in our Chinese are saying, you say, well, if you step, uh, one step back, your sky is wide open. So that kind of directive is really, you're not telling them what to do but you give them a way, a different way of thinking. So that's comforting because, in some ways, the culture really supports this hierarchy, the counselor, client, the counselor, provider suggest directly helped the clients. When clients think you're doing what they expect the culture supports, you're more likely to be successful. The other things about adjustment. Who defines adjustment. The way we teach counseling, we have based our adjustment definition on the individual. You are working with a system, not an individual. Having said this, all I hope to achieve by today is that you think for yourself how we should do international, how we should internationalize our field. Thank you for your attention. Sorry I didn't give enough time to ask questions.

Qualitative findings From counselors perspective -Ability of giving brilliant directives defines competence -"Implementation" is not "doing what I said" - client may "experience" the directives and show effectiveness in multiple other ways -Good directives are delivered through an "in-directive" or "subtle" approach. -Best if the client is not "aware" that a directive is heard 

00:44:15
Developing a theory of counseling in China Challenges: -Facing the "Western influences" which has been "established" & integrated into China -Navigating between the immediate psychological needs of the "individual" and his/her need for long term adjustment -Counseling is not a place for "freeing the individual from cultural influence" 

00:44:15
A Theory of Counseling in China (work in progress) Personal quality of counselor -Being a person of integrity with high ability for empathy -Understanding the "cultural reality" -Respecting individuals' psychological needs in context of the culture Role of counselor -Modeling - Validating - Persuading - Directing Method of counseling -Effective communication (indirect, subtle, validating, empowering...) -Share "wisdom" through directives -Teach "coping skills" in addition to " coping method" (navigating between cultural expectations and personal needs) 

00:44:15
HOW to use directives Goals -Show that there is solution -Show "I care about you" -Build and reinforce client confidence Content Acceptable by the cultural environment Leading to behavior that makes the person a better family member, team player, ... Delivery method -Client needs to "own" the positive outcome
