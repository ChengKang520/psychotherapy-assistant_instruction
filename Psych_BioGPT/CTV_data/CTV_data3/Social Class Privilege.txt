00:00:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hi, I'm Lewis Schlosser I'm a professor of counseling psychology at CNO university and here with me today is Dr. Will Liu who is a professor of counseling psychology and the training director of the university of Iowa. One of Dr. Liu's areas of research expertise is in social class and today we're going to be talking about Social Class Privilege. Well, thank you so much for coming. 

00:00:45
WILLIAM LIU My Pleasure. 

00:00:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Willing to have this conversation about this area privilege. I think we have to start would be, it would be helpful so just give our audience just you take on what Social Class Privilege means to you. 

00:01:00
WILLIAM LIU I think Social Class Privilege still revolves around the idea of unearned benefits, unearned resources and opportunities that are given to somebody not form anything that they've done, but just because if you they are the, the biggest difference with social class is that and my argument is Social Class is relatively invisible, it's not like if you're a man or woman, or a person of color, but because it's relatively invisible you tend to have to do something to trigger those privileges. And so for me those when people have unearned privileges or people want those particular Social Class Privileges they have to do something to demonstrate that they are of their worthy of that particular privilege. Now their other interesting thing is I think for Social Class Privilege we really only talking about those in upper wealthy affluent social classes so unlike for instance male privilege most man are given that particular privilege because they are men. Unlike that Social Class Privilege we're really talking about unearned privileges, unknown benefits and opportunities it's really on a gear towards those of affluent, wealth and higher educational backgrounds, but like I said it I think those the de-marketers of Social Class Privilege are invisible and so people have to do something in order to trigger that, so it might be the way they dress, the car that they drive, even the way they talk about themselves they have to do something to trigger that, that the particular privilege that’s given to somebody, is it given to them. 

00:03:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER That was about sort of one of my follow ups… 

00:03:00
WILLIAM LIU Yeah. 

00:03:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …if you have some of these to trigger behaviors you know that… 

00:03:05
WILLIAM LIU Trigger behaviors. 

00:03:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER What people… what people do to, to get that probably you know that sort of… 

00:03:10
WILLIAM LIU Yeah. 

00:03:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …for themselves say like I'm, I'm of this class. 

00:03:10
WILLIAM LIU Well one of the, one of the things that and I don't mean this is any barb against those who come from I believe colleges and universities, but I was find that interesting among my friends and colleagues who might have had an undergraduate degree from and I've really have they've always managed to be new for or drop that they went to Harvard or Princeton now it comes off very and innocuous, but I think as an interesting way it's a very salve way to say this is what came from, this is my educational background and for those who might be impressed by that then there is certain privileges that might be falling to them, right. 

00:03:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So your saying that were some… 

00:03:55
Yeah. 

00:03:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I went here and… 

00:04:00
WILLIAM LIU Alright. 

00:04:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER What are the privileges you think should go to someone for Harvard. 

00:04:00
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:04:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And for them to make. 

00:04:05
WILLIAM LIU Right, and what I've also found is that for those folks you end up going out of the colleges and universities they also tend to find themselves in new environments, they find themselves they find each other in these new environments and so I think there is something to be said about triggering those funny ways to trigger those privileges and those opportunities for themselves. 

00:04:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER In a new environment or someone has to be said because it may be more visible. 

00:04:30
WILLIAM LIU Alright. 

00:04:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Who know like… 

00:04:30
WILLIAM LIU Alright. 

00:04:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I'm quite ready for morbid. 

00:04:30
WILLIAM LIU Right, right and then you know the other ways would be the ways that we address the cars that we drive, the things that we affiliate ourselves either associate ourselves with the places that we stay, the places the we talk about in terms of how we vacation I… I live in a relatively working class neighborhood and we moved in there when I was a graduate when I just had graduated and so we couldn't afford really an expensive home so we ended that moving into this working class environment and one of the things that is interesting is that for a lot of them their vacations revolve around driving to machismo(ph) which is a great vacation and they take week off and what we've found for, for ourselves is we tend not to talk about where we vacation because I think they there is a… there is a… there is a difference in terms of how we vacation in the time that we have allotted to ourselves in terms of free time so for us to take to two weeks off or a month off because on an academic calendars big deal, but for them you know they, they have a week off, so that's it's a different way of how we talk about all leisure activities as well. 

00:05:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So if I understand you correctly what do you actually doing may be expose it is not trying to… 

00:06:00
WILLIAM LIU Not trying to. 

00:06:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER At the very privilege in that sense… 

00:06:05
WILLIAM LIU Right, right. 

00:06:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …that I have a longer vacation or it might not just trying to know much more. 

00:06:10
WILLIAM LIU In that sense there is sort of reflex on my sense of different types of classism and I think what I'm very, very conscious self is, is I don’t think they in this particular context with these folks and then my neighborhood it's not that, it's not privilege that I'd get from and I think I would experience a kind of classism and in this regard I would be considered upper class and they would, they might be considered working in middle or lower class and so they might see ourselves not be our leaders because we have all these what they might proceed is free time and extra money that do all these different things. And so I'm very conscious is that so I try not to, I'm trying not to trigger that in our, in our action. 

00:07:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right suppose someone who wanted to… 

00:07:00
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:07:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …benefit from us. 

00:07:05
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:07:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER What they would think a Social Class Privilege… 

00:07:05
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:07:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …might say we were going to go took them… 

00:07:05
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:07:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Somewhere. 

00:07:10
WILLIAM LIU Right, my well my discussions with you I mean we're on this more academic calendar we have seen you know in terms of congruence Social Class Congruence were sort of very similar and so when we say I feel much more free to say or you know I we've been here for a week and then we do this and we have another we got for school struts that doesn't trigger anything other than of course when you're on a academic calendar so there is some Social Class Congruence, but when there is a discrepancy I think that's when you have to be little more conscious how they know little more careful about how you display those things how, how you want to trigger those particular privileges or classisms on to you and so for me as a mild research you know I'm much more I'm trying to be much more aware of how I say these things and how comes across to tell the people. 

00:08:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And what that might be in for, for people how they will take it given if you want to ask that for about that they might think that you are trying to again operate there no operate activate that sort of privilege… 

00:08:15
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:08:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …if you coming of in different perspective. 

00:08:15
WILLIAM LIU Right, right, right you make some process of braggart from the crosses, some may use snobby you talk about I mean that's… that's… that's the kind of classism and that you would invade from another person, so. 

00:08:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Sessions like one very clear example of our Social Class Privilege sort of talk about other, other concrete examples you might be able to share which you can think about that would, help the folks would watch us video like understand like how, how to social like how do a Social Class Privilege would look like on a day-to-day you know like in everyday life? 

00:08:50
WILLIAM LIU Right I… i think there are these daily day activities that we can engage and that are part of our privilege whether not we recognize them as opportunities and extra benefits we're not it… it can be simple sort of I… i see privileges as relatively for most people unconscious and not something that's actually at the forefront so they so for instance of privilege might be being able to navigate a checking in a hotel could be going to a particular type of fancy restaurant knowing how did, how the navigate getting a table how to work all these different things were kinds of privileges that you treat it because they're unconscious they're all medics it puts in a particular position forge a different kind of resources and so those are the daily day kinds of activities that you might be engaged in that, they list it privilege. 

00:09:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER You mean excuse me but sort of knowing the act… 

00:10:00
WILLIAM LIU No I have to act… 

00:10:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …and, and like. 

00:10:00
WILLIAM LIU They are Social Class behaviors exactly so you know you had to act as one thing, know you had to speak knowing you should speak to if you want something to happen in environment you know it's not just the I want to speak to your manager but really knowing how that's going to effect you know, know you have to throw it away around that those are the kind of privileges that might happen. The other kind of privilege I think which is much more long standing much more important when it comes to Social Class Privilege especially for the wealthy and affluent in those from more upper social classes is I, I think one distinct Social Class Privilege is there are health benefits people who grow up in wealthier environments tend to have per access to schools, per access to food, less toxic environments better types of day care no problems of transportation, less violence, more recreational activities all those different aspects that are that when they come together lead to a more healthy life style much more healthy life and if you can start that off early kids will grow up in a wealthy environments for the most part have physically much more healthier life and mental health wise research is shown that they are that, that's it's another issue, but in terms of physical health they, they tend to fair better whereas if you're lower working poverty class early working at living in places with much more lenient apartments and housing complexes that are much more dense, much more upon the violence, more difficulty getting any kind of food, what they found the research. 

00:12:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So healthy food right, I mean that certain… 

00:12:00
WILLIAM LIU Healthy food, yeah. 

00:12:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …certainly with out neighborhood that's. 

00:12:00
WILLIAM LIU Yeah. 

00:12:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Like in New York City where I left. 

00:12:05
WILLIAM LIU Yeah. 

00:12:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And if I go 20 or 30 bucks not that mean… 

00:12:05
WILLIAM LIU Alright. 

00:12:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …is that to check the cash in places. 

00:12:10
WILLIAM LIU Right, right, right. 

00:12:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Fast food restaurants and that they guess… 

00:12:15
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:12:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER But you find out finally a few restaurants disappear. 

00:12:15
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:12:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Where there is even to a supermarkets. 

00:12:20
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:12:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And in the supermarkets that they carry different kinds of foods. 

00:12:25
WILLIAM LIU Exactly, and the kinds of foods that the fast food, outlets as well as the convenient stores tend to carry less fresh foods and they carry that was much more is the paradox of poverty and health which is for many people who live in lower working as well as poverty classism they end up eating much more energy dance foods for the money and so you know if you're poor you know have some amount of money which rather spend believe you know three or four dollars on the bad cats or you could spend three or four dollars on a whole meal that includes hamburger, French fries, a drink and deserve and you make those decisions because it makes much more sense in terms of nutritional energy, energy availability in terms of the carbohydrates, density in the foods… 

00:13:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Of a full want I finish my meal… 

00:13:15
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:13:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER If I have to buy the carrots… 

00:13:20
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:13:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …that might not you do not you that when you ever feel forward and done. 

00:13:20
WILLIAM LIU Right now that you know like I said that the I was helpless access to recreational activities and those kinds of things so there are when it comes to privilege in Social Class Privilege if you're growing up wealthy affluent there are distinct advantages and privileges that, that are afforded to you. And I think those are Social Class like I said Social Class Privilege as much different in other concept privilege because it's really gear towards only one group in that Social Class and the top of Social Class Privilege and they talk about the affluent and wealthy. 

00:13:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Can you talk a little bit about I know that one of the things for me I never go into a graduate schools finding that personal connection with the centenary to help my just sort of have an effect of understanding or something and he would like to have intellectual understanding or something. So if you could talk about we've evenly for speaking interesting and understanding social class as it's like, as a psychologist or, or if was in that school and before like … 

00:14:20
WILLIAM LIU Yeah. 

00:14:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …how from early the interest come in this area? 

00:14:30
WILLIAM LIU I'm I, I actually didn't realize that I was interested in Social Class until one of my graduate school advisors ask me to find something to write about that was on race and genders sort of only really left one other editor look out and so I thought okay, well also looking into it and we are our regional project was the right a small article or something like that, but after that we it just blossomed and I ended up spending lot of time really coming the literary basis not only in psychology which oxygen take a lot much time because there wasn’t much out there at all, most psychology texts, research chapters offered what I call to a parenthetical discussions in Social Class which is councilor should be aware of multi cultural said such as waste gender and Social Class and parenthesis and that was pretty much it. 

00:15:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And we're going to focus races and gender, right, right. 

00:15:25
WILLIAM LIU Right and so they're on top of Social Class and so I spend several years just I ended up not writing that piece but ended up spending really my professional creator writing and just reading about Social Class and so I wrote a lot of the scholarly pieces and as those writing I think I became much more where if much more sensitive to my own growing up and my own experiences with Social Class and Social Class changes, Social Class discrepancies my own it's my Social classism issues around passing in terms of coming from a lower class background but trying to pass his middle class there is some parallels in terms of how the, how racing, how race placing to it in terms of how they talk about racial passing there were Social Class passing and really if I've really gone into this sort of talking more about this idea of classism and dramas dramatic classism and I think it just took some time for me to get to this place really as certainly think about did I, I did expense some classism and dramas and what were those kinds of dramas that being made fun off not having the right clothing coming from a working class background being ashamed of people knowing about it, people make him fun of me and how did I respond to it and those were types of dramas that I still carried around with me and… and learning how to deal, really learning how to live with it and what I've also found is as I offer this kind of construct out of students and even to and to many clients they do, they do resonate with it. There is for I think for many people if I frame into these classism and that sort have been made fun of because you didn’t; fit in because you didn’t have right clothes or car or came from a different kind of Social Class background if I frame it like that can you think of the particular instant that really stood out at mind most people are mentally think that something there is something that pops into them and that they know about it and what I found also is that it's such a rich but also painful place for them that they in some ways have frame the part of their life around it in terms of always having to cope with different things somebody who I declined who always talked about well you know it's not pricing I was talking on making money and… and living in, in an expensive area and… and driving nice cars and really is really focus on money and so when we started to talk about this little bit more one other things that came up from him was growing up and growing up in poverty. And for him this idea I'm never going back I want to do everything I can I'm never going back to that life style and I want to experience it I don't want to see the and what that came out was I don't want to see the sadness, I don't want to see the shame, I don't want to experience that so what can I do to really guard myself and everybody had know from that experience from here on now. There are some positives, positives to it in a sense that motivates people to potentially do better things for themselves and… and for their life, but I think to an extreme like anything it can become debilitating, it can become singular focus on money, it can be a singular focus on materialism and what the research also shares is that want to move to that round there is the people become unhappy. 

00:19:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER But they can t' buy your happiness. 

00:19:10
WILLIAM LIU You know he can't buy, yeah can't buy there your happiness I think that's what it comes down to there are some restrictions that argue about you know how much money does it take to makes me happy and some research has shown that this amount of money does make people happy anything above that is doesn't do anything but anything below it you know there is some greater in terms of what happened in his lives but in terms of how much people money people making that to make them happy there is no set amount because it's all related to how you see yourself in relation to peers. And so as a professor when I talk to other professors we're happy generally we're making so I have no fantasy that I'm going to be making millions of dollars in future that's just not what my peer group is and that's not where I see myself, and that's not what my happiness lies, my happiness lies in different ways that I value that income that I have but on top of that valuing also free time control with my time, sense of control with my life all those aspects are related to happiness since once sense of what being and sense of control at one's time and that in particular is a kind of privilege that people have when you're working in environments were you have much more done heavy work, much more control of that what you do, you're valued in your work those kinds of things are characteristic of middle class and upper class working environments which is different than man you live environments where you it's much more out of credit you told what to do there is no feedback and so you would expect that many people in those working environments tell that to enjoy their jobs for the most part. 

00:21:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And that we note there you don’t make money where as if you're… 

00:21:15
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:21:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …your university well I mean have your salary and you’re going to… 

00:21:15
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:21:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …almost the teacher course is… 

00:21:20
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:21:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Have a great deal of the tone that it's very different sort of world? 

00:21:20
WILLIAM LIU Yeah, it is a different kind of world and that since a well being is a kind of unconscious privilege that people have that you may not be aware of but feels into you since that well being and overall it does sort of contribute overall to your overall health mental well being and just go off. 

00:21:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And it seems a little bit like it's a contrast for example the client you shared who is like bar man that just make as much money as possible. 

00:21:50
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:21:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER He might have made have been… 

00:21:50
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:21:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …happy or unhappy in his job, but that didn't matter. 

00:21:50
WILLIAM LIU Right, yeah. 

00:21:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER All of us really saying it was I'm coming back to the environment that I came from. 

00:22:00
WILLIAM LIU Right, I… I… I know bankers, I know people in finance they make a lot of money I think I'm it's safe to say that I don't know to many other actually happy and with what they're doing. I think they get got up and sort of that life style. They're very adapt they're talking about the things that they surround themselves with but in terms of being happy and having since well being I'm not necessarily sure that they have that they, they have all the privileges that are given to them but I'm not necessarily sure that, that actually contributes to and things that happen to us. So I think in some ways that might be one of the things that makes Social Class Privilege some of unique not everything contributes to their well being necessarily. 

00:22:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right where as other aspects of privilege may? 

00:22:55
WILLIAM LIU It might, yeah. 

00:22:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER When you're seeing this… 

00:22:55
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:22:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …by default. 

00:22:55
WILLIAM LIU Right, right. 

00:23:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Are there any one before, you before I wanted to say that (inaudible ) whether other formative experiences besides that's once you talked about us sort of classism and dramas whether other things since you wanted to share that was sort of formative and formative and developing interesting because I know that whenever goodness is sort of help them find some personal connection to the material… 

00:23:20
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:23:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …because it sort of helps I think at times helps make it accessible… 

00:23:25
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:23:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …to understand that? 

00:23:25
WILLIAM LIU I definitely think that these experiences that are really, really compelled me to continue my research, my clinical address have commit different points in my life, different points in my life have really made Social Class salient so one of the stories I've, I've told elsewhere is when we first moved to Iowa we I did my internship in Los Angeles and so we were used to live in a small two bedroom apartment and, and had one car and one other things that happened was when we moved into this new neighborhood I've really for some reason had a sense that we were inadequate because as we were walking around the neighborhood everybody else had long mowers and snow blowers and three or four difference now showers and all these other implements and we are go out as completely empty because growing up and living in Los Angels it none of that met anything I feel lot better now because we have our long mowers we have our snow shower we have all the things that's sort of make us social lead Social Class congruent with everybody else there. I think the next piece has that's really need Social Class much more pregnant for me is the birth of my daughter and really this really sort of throughout into a whole different Social Class environment and you have kids on it's suddenly aware of different kinds of classism on the privilege and Social classism she use that you really were I mean from the analysis sort of blind to I knew about these things but I was relatively blind to talking to people about where is your child going to take care you know if they're going to this particular one versus this one you know to people look down you because you got this one versus that one or even, you know even stupid stuff like that I mean to say stupid its really innocuous things… 

00:25:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Things are considered to be fairly monitored but… 

00:25:30
WILLIAM LIU Okay, doing blind stuff like things such as the kind of strollers that he have it's just like I was amazed you know that… 

00:25:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Whether your kid wears cotton brand, pajamas, or gap or something fancy? 

00:25:45
WILLIAM LIU Yeah, it's mine, it's completely my involvement so and… 

00:25:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Perhaps excuse me. 

00:25:50
WILLIAM LIU Yeah. 

00:25:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER That were you go to daycare as Harvard we have discussion of… 

00:25:55
WILLIAM LIU It is the offer for kids. 

00:25:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …offer young children. 

00:26:00
WILLIAM LIU Yeah, I think there are lot of people who made contributions already to if you go here then yourself you know and this is sort of the road to success and the nice thing is from my wife and I who are, who are sort of well verse in developmental issues were not really I mean it's going to be non-violent you know they got to have some one on one attention and showed us those kinds of things everybody is really even though and if you want to think that that's fine but then you know so where we're able to make sense of that but it is interesting because I think different parents, different people gravitate towards you and again this is, this is the, these are the ways that you trigger privilege and opportunities you know they if they see you with certain things they start to saddle up next to you when they wanted to be associated with you and they want their kids be associated with your kids and so and then so forth and so and I think that you know people make those kinds of distinctions very quickly I think it's a very automatic judgment that people make an automatic attributions that people make about Social Class then who you are and what do you mean to them as well and so if I'm affiliated with you then that sort of buttresses my Social Class attended in my social class will view. 

00:27:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER What's hindering sorts of the different and other aspects of privilege that can't be, you can say it can be a person of color side of up to a white person and enjoy that white -- and maybe you get some benefit, right like in some, in some was if like… 

00:27:35
WILLIAM LIU Right, right. 

00:27:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …whereas my friend if I was a more the time with maybe more resist radiology… 

00:27:40
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:27:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …that there would be like well. 

00:27:40
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:27:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER If do things well as okay, perhaps… 

00:27:45
WILLIAM LIU Right, right. 

00:27:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …perhaps it's different from the others that you know that can become an exception… 

00:27:50
WILLIAM LIU Yeah. 

00:27:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …type approach to ways but in a Social Class they're saying maybe sort of more, more fluid. 

00:27:55
WILLIAM LIU If much more fluid I think it's, it's invisible I think people are socialized to look for certain things for certain triggers and, and I… I think people do have a sense that they want to be associate with things that are much more upper class and so I think there, there is something to be well something to be said about that in terms of people want to be started up and being associated with that and with respect to the that the race issue I… I have been sort of bouncer on this ideas that you know there is a built an assumption around privilege that if you're racial minority and you're affluent that you must have built your success on not just privilege and resources but a special things that other people can get and so I think for many, I did believe that for many racial ethnic minority individuals who might be affluent to well off or well educated their privilege is attenuated it's mitigated I think he can be a hugely wealthy racial in minority but I think people it should be the fact that you must have gotten that somehow by some special something other than your mare or being smart, whereas… 

00:29:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER That's what… so you, you were affirmed that actually admission to Harvard… 

00:29:25
WILLIAM LIU Exactly, exactly… 

00:29:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …or something along those lines not that you just… 

00:29:25
WILLIAM LIU Where is that. 

00:29:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …but I pull myself upon the (inaudible ). 

00:29:32
WILLIAM LIU Right, right, right, exactly and so that I think they built an assumption as if you were wide and often potentially if that was all based on your marriage but… 

00:29:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Self made. 

00:29:40
WILLIAM LIU …self made but not, not the case from that so I think for racial I think minority individuals there is sort of a plateau of that in terms of the privileges that there for it. you know there is a for if you’re - I… I think for me if you're white and affluent and privilege and wealthy those privileges keep coming to you regardless of however wealthy you are and you never have to ask for them I think for racial I think minority potentially there is a point when you stuck to have the demand for them and so those privileges there is a plateau of that in terms of our metricity of those privileges afforded to you. 

00:30:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Do you think us where racism comes and effected there may be an assumption in United States that if you are a person of color you're not affluent. 

00:30:30
WILLIAM LIU Yes. 

00:30:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Because maybe there is like that there is a… 

00:30:30
WILLIAM LIU Yes, yes, yes. 

00:30:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …and automatic assumption if I'm going to spend going to a wealthy person they're going to like everyone. 

00:30:35
WILLIAM LIU Yes, yes. 

00:30:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER In a right some. 

00:30:35
WILLIAM LIU Yes, exactly. And in a statistics the demographics don’t bear that out and, and I think, I… I think from most people they understand that there is a history of racism there are barriers in our society the degree to which they acknowledge recognize those as major impediments to financial or economics success varies but for racial I think minorities I think they are still significant barriers in terms of class mobility upward. 

00:31:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Well these kind of jumps were not in my question thus it was prefect, its fine. 

00:31:20
WILLIAM LIU That's true. 

00:31:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Okay, on the other ways in which you've think other aspects is rolls your tongue away is that other aspects of identity sort of interact to I guess he got to tend away got hands or so how do those interact and I mean impact Social Class Privilege maybe other of course gender or sex plantation… 

00:31:35
WILLIAM LIU Yeah. 

00:31:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …well that you know other aspects of identity. 

00:31:40
WILLIAM LIU Well I think the, the I still think that more and more mix if you are, or perceive normal to you, normal you are I think do you still can't accrue those we did the aromatic senior those privileges is much more robust so if you're, if you're physically, racially you look white, you comport yourself mostly as a what most people we got as heterosexual you don't, you dress relatively middle class I think there is a lot of privileges dramatically just come to you and you don't even have to ask for them. 

00:32:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER A female. 

00:32:20
WILLIAM LIU Right, right and, and those things just come out dramatically and so whereas in… in other when she start adding those other layers diversity I think they sort to be their… their different things that become attenuated if you're racial I think minority that's a piece to it, if you're a women that's a piece to it, if you're openly gave us that's been is a piece to it, if you're disables or differently able that's you know that all those things do play into how Social Class Privileges that the types of Social Class Privileges were afforded and. 

00:33:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Let me now talk about two specific once that I've always sort of the scratch and it makes that I would like to scratch. 

00:33:05
WILLIAM LIU Sure, sure. 

00:33:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER That have you talk about is for example some I think this is most of typical assumptions people make about a gay couple specifically gay male couple now as being more privileged… 

00:33:15
WILLIAM LIU More privileged. 

00:33:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …more economically privileged because you have two man, men being more you know being more for the same work then not they're in the gender discrimination and pain and there may be other certain types well maybe not have a children may be less innoless and things that train on your… 

00:33:30
WILLIAM LIU Right, right. 

00:33:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …on your income. 

00:33:30
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:33:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And that will be one example and then the other example would be for example groups of juice who are so these as per the book was sort of seen two groups were seen as economically privileged. 

00:33:40
WILLIAM LIU Great, great, great. 

00:33:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Has been a part of an assumption people. 

00:33:50
WILLIAM LIU I think, I think those economic Social Class Privileges are afforded to you as long as you don’t, as long as you're going to do anything that disrupts the nature that they have there and the narrative what I mean by that is these are the assumptions that they have about you as long as you're going to do anything to disrupt it those privileges come to you right, so if you're a gay male, male couple and you just walk into a restaurant and it just looks like two guys going out for lunch or to dinner and it's something deal but if you showing a kind of reflection behavior towards job then I think those things are to be come out with more attenuated now and… 

00:34:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Because of the homophobia society all of the sudden if you hold the hands for a short kissing. 

00:34:35
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:34:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER People are going to not feel us privilege as we get normally. 

00:34:40
WILLIAM LIU Right, right and demonstrating any hand culture there and hence that's not wide angle sacs and sort of the cultural norm you know, today the Christian cultural norm. 

00:34:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So I think you don't fit in the way we, as what we assume about you? 

00:35:00
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:35:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER If we fit in well that you have some of the good use, but otherwise, not us you know, you're… you're stepping out and we are not having that. 

00:35:05
WILLIAM LIU Right, right. 

00:35:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Other some order and if so whatever some misconceptions that may have about above Social Class Privilege and so you could be like to talk about. 

00:35:15
WILLIAM LIU Misconceptions of Social Class Privilege it's good question, misconceptions of Social Class Privilege. 

00:35:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER That maybe in one of things I may thinking about and then we talked about this of gone away you know we have the days the issues of classism and so the directionality… 

00:35:40
WILLIAM LIU Oh, right. 

00:35:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …of classism and they're different using the field about. 

00:35:40
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:35:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER About whether one can be classism they're depending upon one special pattern? 

00:35:50
WILLIAM LIU Right, right, I do think there are different types of classism that are, that are out there in our in the personal lives and then in our relationships and that’s what I've really want to focus and I do think for the most part at a structural level and side level the most pervasive kind of classism is still related to any quality and in equities that the discrepancy between the rich and then and whether poor or and really the missing middle group I think statistically economically from tact records and many to our reports. There is a small group of very wealthy hyper-rich individuals and there as the rest of the side there is not too much left in the middle anyone. And I… and I think that rich are still in control of most of the levels of paranoid it mean some paranoid but I think you know they still want to see certain things happen that allow them to retain their wealth and their power and the privilege. And so that kind of structural classism still exists and I think that's what I would consider downward from rich to poor, the poor only lacking the power. If you look at it from as into personal matter from person to person do you think there are different kinds of calssism that you appear references there are certainly is downward classism and somebody who might consider themselves rich looks down on somebody who is poor, but also think there is the person who might be lower class he see somebody who is wealthy and calls them and attributes to them, calls them leaders to a snobby… 

00:37:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER The reasons you don't maybe talk about your vacation schedule? 

00:37:45
WILLIAM LIU Right, right. 

00:37:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER If you have more privilege in that way then you're neighbor is? 

00:37:50
WILLIAM LIU Right, right and, and, and now regard I'm not saying that person who is poor has as much power to somebody's vision not even equating that at all what I'm, but I'm actually getting out is the relational piece the pain that the person might feel to having that attribution made towards them where there is kinds of assumptions made towards them, still can be very real and that particular kind of conflict will it does overtime contribute to other kinds of structural any qualities I mean and so I do believe that those kinds of poor those conflict ridden and our actions are that then there is what else I consider lateral classism in which is essentially a kind of keeping up with the jounces you see somebody with something you wanted as well but it's not beyond that there is also you remaining other people hey you're not keeping up with what's going on. And the last piece of me was internalize notion of classism in which is when I don't feel as that I belong with respect to my class how do I feel you know and for people who feel disrupt and fund there Social Class then may feel depress frustrated despondent so see those kinds of issues with respect to classism. 

00:39:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Well in those, those were the experiences you might get any level of social class(ph) because I… 

00:39:20
WILLIAM LIU It doesn’t matter the social class exactly it’s the inter personal piece that really I'm. I'm responding to that. What can you do about this in therapy, how do I get somebody who might be wealthy they actually talk about their expenses of classism I can't just going there and assume that they've been privileged and walled off from everything I do believe that they also experienced, there are forms of classism they're not the same kind of experiences that I've had but I think that just as meaningful to them that they need to talk about with respect to whatever they're presenting issues. 

00:39:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right, I mean in the New York City I have crazy stories about the private school world and… 

00:39:55
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:40:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …And children at the young age and that who lives in the townhouse versus an apartment. 

00:40:05
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:40:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Who gets brought in a car versus gets brought by the (inaudible ). 

00:40:07
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:40:07
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And the childern how where these things and I think like who cares. 

00:40:10
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:40:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER But… but it matters and, and because that people differentiate themselves. 

00:40:15
WILLIAM LIU Right, right. 

00:40:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER About what that means about where you were even that brings you to school… 

00:40:20
WILLIAM LIU The researchers that as young as kids as young as four and five they structured develop brand knowledge in other words they start telling know what our good brand and bad brands and otherwise it's just shown if you ask them to put things into lower middle and upper class they're able to do that with pretty consistent rate they're being very regular and being very accurate about what they conserve bad brands, lower class brands and upper class brands. And so those kinds of things happen very fairly and quickly. 

00:40:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So we talked a bit about, about what it is and where you're interesting from sort of the last piece that everyone have to talk about like, like what can you do about it that's where into two pieces of that like one would be what how can we get folks and how Social Class Privilege to sort of and you know as an educator when we work with different areas how can we get folks you have the privilege to sort of be where that and sort of we practically understand someone else's experiences of how social how this aspect that diligent backs from you. 

00:41:20
WILLIAM LIU Right. 

00:41:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And if you one question you like? 

00:41:25
WILLIAM LIU I do approach it from racial monistic standpoint I do believe that most people want and inherently want to connect with other people and they want to learn about understand that the people as well. And so what we have to do better as educators as clinicians, as researchers as well it's the better communicate how can you be aware of your privilege accessories sources all as different things without necessarily shaming them along the way having and talk about those kinds of experiences how they will later the people and without it's not that I don't want them to feel bad but I think there is a level of shame that comes with it and when that shame is triggered I think it should shut off clients had to shut off because it’s a natural protection for them it's they're protection really they're most vulnerable self they want to learn but other people but as soon as they open up and you tell them it's bad they will shut down and I think that's not necessarily what we want to do as clinicians. And so we can advocate, we can ask people who have certain concept privileged to you use it differently to be a much more aware that I suppose philosophically you know that the people in upper class privilege that you use their privilege just reinforce it but I don't know any other way to get out that particular psyche of privilege for me is, is something the situation and the environment affords you gives you for the most part and so those of the particular privileges you can't just forefeet I don't believe you can forefeet privilege you can just say I'm not going to do this anymore. The privileges already have environment and are… are those resources in these opportunities and benefits around there people with privilege are much more able to recognize with those things or a much more depth at a much quicker at accessing and using those what's at all…all three alignment before them. And so I do believe you can work with clients did you that I think a structural level I think it also benefits us to think about how we can work with other agencies that aren't so reference since working with banks and other lending institutions becoming much more aware of economics and finances really sort of seeing that as a very important part of the clients life, being much more aware of our environments as well as so what I'm much more aware of is the proponent and the prevalence of pay their loans in certain environments and I know because they're all concentrated there in… in some parts of the town a lot of people are probably in… in very deep cycles of death the research again shows they pay their loans only for the first time that you're on top and then successively after that with the fund percentage is very they're always behind so it never works that after that and so I'm much more willing to engage city council members and talking to, talking to other people who make these sort of municipal decisions about what impact that has on our communities. And so I think in that respect we need to see social justice is not none as such as race and gender but class and what is class of social justice look like. 

00:45:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Is there you know you know is there anything that you have hoped I would ask you about today or I didn’t things that we've been know if like someone said to you what people needs social class privilege that you didn't say that you wanted to… 

00:45:20
WILLIAM LIU I think… 

00:45:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I guess as some shows are calling your parting shunt. 

00:45:25
WILLIAM LIU I think you can pretty I… I… I've enjoy the opportunity to talk about this and I enjoy the conversations I think you can put it there on your questions. 

00:45:35
