PAT LOVE Hi, I'm Pat Love, Doctor of education and counselor education teaching human sexuality here with you, and I'm with Pat Love and Associates. I've been a professor. I've been in private practice, mostly working with couples now for the past 30, 35 years. Welcome to the course and thank you all for coming. So, when it comes to relationship sexuality in general, and your sexuality, my sexuality in specific, I want you to think about it for a moment. And think about yourself as a sexual person, because one of the biggest points around this issue is one size doesn't fit all. Think, when I say to you, think about yourself as a sexual entity. What comes to mind, I mean, do you think about your thoughts, your appearance, your behavior, your dreams, your fantasies and how does that change, given the time a day, the time a month, the time a year, a relationship you may be in or not in, uh… the context, where you are, how you're felling, I mean, there's so many moving parts when it comes to sexuality. And, I think when you are working with couples and individuals around this issue, this is the big message I want to deliver, and that is one size doesn't fit all, one model doesn't fit all. Right now, there's a big discussion in the field about well what helps couples, what helps individuals, is it more contact, more closeness, more understanding, that deep intimacy that comes from gazing, and touching, and being together and connecting at a deep level? Or it is more about adventure, and mystery, and having a private life, an autonomy? Is… and what is it about this tension between the two that we all want all of the above. So one size doesn't fits all, and we know that about human sexuality because it is complex. And I think the temptation when you are working with this issue is to think one size fits all. So that's… you're going to hear me say that several times throughout the course. And there are so many approaches to working with individuals and working with couples, that researchers have actually give this… given this stress around so many choices, this term, "choice fatigue." It appears that on any given day, we have only so much energy for making decisions. And the longer you go throughout the day, the worse your decision making becomes. That's why all the bad stuff for you in the grocery is right there before the checkout, you know, because the more decisions you make and the more choices you have, the more stress there is and the more likely you're just going to do what you're familiar with, do what you've done before, do what you believe and not backup and look at what the research says or the clini… clinical observation or experience says. So, we want to take away some of the stress. And even though there is a lot of stress with this, wouldn't it be nice if one size did fit all? I think about that little black dress, you know, the dress you want to get that for every occasion, wouldn't it be great just to go in and grab it? Or think… how many of you have ever been shopping for a pillow or you're trying to right… get the every perfect… Wouldn't it be great if one pillow worked for all of us, or a lounge chair or whatever it is, I mean, especially in a world that's so complex, there is this longing for one size fits all. But sometimes it doesn't fit all, and we know that we it comes to sexual desire, one size doesn't fit all. Even twins, even people who are similar, don't have the same experience around sexual desire. I was hired recently by this really fancy spa, and there's this group of six girlfriends that come every year to the spa. So, they hired me to come in and talk about sexuality. It was really a cool afternoon. I thought, "What a cool thought this was." But these are six women who've known each other for 17, 18 years and I remember one moment when I was talking about, "Do you have sex when you're angry?" And two people said, "Absolutely, why would I deprive myself just because I'm angry at my partner?" And the other ones were like, "What? Why on earth would you have sex when you're angry?" And they're saying, "Hey, grudge sex is some of the best… best sex." You know, so here… here were people who knew each other, hung out together and they were shocked to find out that again, one size doesn't fits all. And what creates desire in individuals is also different, not to mention, how you express that desire. For example, there are millions… I don't know about millions, a significant percentage of the population, 2% to 3 % it's estimated are asexual and asexual… they don't feel sexual desire, they love, but they don't fall in love, and this is a group that wants us to know this is not a disorder, this is not a pathology and it doesn't need fixing. So, we also vary in the way that we express or don't express sexual desire or even experience it. The other thing is, think about… how many of you remember your first kiss? Okay, your first kiss was part that… at that time that's what you desired, that was the epitome, that was the Holy Grail to get that first kiss perhaps. But right then, you know, now you had to move beyond that, a kiss isn't enough as you build up a tolerance, as it no longer is that… that mysterious new novel experience. So… So we know what works even today may not work tomorrow. And many individuals and couples will come to you because there's been this change. They realize that, okay, we had a great sexual experience, we had a great sexual relationship, or I used to have a lot of sexual desire, where did it go? Or I used to desire my partner, and I don't anymore and where did that go? What's wrong with me or us or my partner? Here's part of the mystery, and by the way, the reason… People often say, "How do you use research in helping people?" First of all, it guides my strategies, but I also find often times, Dan Siegel has a line that says, "Name it to tame it." Once you understand why this happens, it often lowers your anxiety and then you can understand it and create your own strategy. So, I use research every single time I sit down with clients. A lot of times, it… it's guiding me, but I'm also perhaps quoting it. And as if… since I'm saying that, we know that research predicts for groups better than individuals, there're always the outliers, there're always the exceptions. Aren't there? But we know that what was novel yesterday is familiar today. Your brain is programmed to pay attention to new things 'cause it wants to new it is friend or is it foe? And so your brain pays attention to novelty lot longer than something you've all ready seen. So, what's novel sexually one day is for… and get you excited and hold your attention and your focus, is familiar today. And when it comes to sexuality, there are lots of moving parts. So… part of what I love to do, this is why I love being a professor, I love being an educator, is I like to take a lot of information and put it in understandable pieces. So, what I hope to do in this course is give you some understandable pieces that will help you in your own life, in your own relationships, but also that you can translate to the people they're working with and you're helping. For some, this is a big issue, for some, despite a desperate desire to want to desire, they lack desire. And this is a phenomenon that couples come in a lot of times or may be individuals and it goes like this, "I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore." That is one of the biggest issues and one of the most common difficulties couples face, it's what's known as "desire discrepancy." I often call this, "I'm hot and you're not." In other words, one wants to have sex and walks around ready for sex and the other just doesn't know where it went. It used to be here, but it's not there anymore. So, let's look at here… this too… and there's some that desire, but they don't even like what they desire. And this is a very important strategic piece clinically. Wanting and liking are two different motivational systems. You can want what you don't like, and you can like what you don't want. And when it comes to sexual compulsivity and… and… and, actually sexual behaviors we're going talk about later, that can cross, get you out of bounce and cross even your own values, it's important to know these are two different motivational systems. You can want what you don't like and you can like what you don't want. Umm… Even though some approaches work some of the time, being more connected, having more closeness, not all approaches work all of the time. That's why we're required to have continuing education. That's why taking order to keep a license, we have to stay current, because it isn't just what size fits all. But, what does work? And this is an overriding theme that gives me a lot of confidence. What is it that research says, "Thank you, Scott Miller," at all for these facts and that is there are three… three predictors of positive outcome that makes clients go, "Ye! Therapy worked!" You know, and what are they? Number one, the client… and this is what clients say, the clients have to believe that A, you understand me, you… you… you get me and you like me. Your number one way to get sued is if the client thinks you don't like them. That's a predictor by the way. So number one, you… you understand me. Number two, the client has to think you're smart. You have something to deliver. That's one reason why I like research by the way. It shows that I'm… I'm on the top of my game, right. So, and it… and it… puts it in a scientific mode. I can't tell you how many clients at the end of a… of a session say, "Thank you for the research, thank you for the… for the facts." "That really made sense to me." So number one, you got to understand me, number two, they have to think you're smart. Here's the third one, your treatment has to make sense. You know, if a couple comes in and they're not having sex and they haven't had sex, you know, for three years, which is not uncommon, and you have them just sitting and talking about anything and they… yes, they feel good when they're sitting and talking, but they leave, they still have the same problem. That treatment made no sense. So, I think I'm gonna give you a lot of information, but when it boils right down to it, those three predictors are what we need to hold on to. People always ask me, "What kind of therapy do you do?" I've been forced to give it a name, so I just say it's client and it's research driven, because that's what I love. And I think that's what… that's what we learn, you know, and that's why we… we have a graduate school, that's why we have licenses, that's why we have continuing education. Umm… But I also know when you learn something new there's a built in resistance to change. And that's why I think courses are so good, because the temptation is to do what I like to do, do what I was taught in the past, and what worked for other clients. But again, we're gonna go back and say, one size doesn't fit all, does it? And why is that, because without research, we are more inclined toward our biases. And I'm telling you, when it comes to sexuality, you're… what… what you like or dislike or what disgusts you or attracts you will not fit your clients all of the time, and I think that goes without saying. So, let's get curious, let's look at the first continuum, 'cause I love continuums. Now I often travel with this clothes line, because anyone can make a PowerPoint, right. But I like continuums because when I'm working with a client and they're giving me so much information, I want to know how… how I then can understand that information and in what context. So, this is a clothes line that on this end, it has two bras and a pair of boxer shorts, and on the right hand end, it's got two pair of boxer shorts and a bra. And, this is a continuum that looks at hormones, and… and whenever I say hormones, half the population gets really cranky because they say… they think, you know, to name it is to… to excuse it or to name it is to blame it. And well, it's just your hormones, you know, and how likes to hear that? That's not what I'm… and yes, and that's true by the way. But what I'm talking about is this point at conception when you were dealt a hand of hormones that influence your sexual experience and your expression. Let's go back here. So, we're looking at this end where you have two bras and one pair of boxer shorts that is the more estrogen dominant person. So, that means about two thirds of women and almost a third of men, the nice guys, the nurtures, the guys that do talk about feelings and… and express themselves in emotionally laden words, you know, that's this end of the continuum. And this end is the more testosterone dominant individual. And yes, it's most men, but it's also almost a third of women. We can't even say in polite company what we call a high testosterone woman, right. Okay, so I want you to sort of keep this… and that's not a surrender flag that white… that white… whit hanky in there, it doesn't mean I surrender, it means, you know, I'm a little bit of both, I'm a little bit of both. And… And that fits a lot of the people too. So, I like this continuum that… that really replicate… that continuum that really shows us the… the hand that you were dealt at birth. Okay. Now why would this still be driving us? Well, part of the reason is we still have a Stone Age brain. Yes, our brains are very adaptable, but it changes at a glacial speed, in other words… and nature sets… there's an advantage to having people who'll have sex at any cost, you know. You know, if a partner said, "Oh, there's a volcano, you know, well, the lava won't be here for a few minutes, you know, let's go ahead." You know, so there was an advantage to having a population of people who would have sex even if it were dangerous. But then there's another advantage to having a person who were more cautionary, you know, "Not until we get a better cave, we are not having sex until you get this cave upgraded, you know. We're not… it's got to be safer, there's got to be food." So you begin to see that we still have this Stone Age brain. If you don't believe it, if we didn't have a Stone Age brain, we wouldn't have a snake phobia, we'd have a car phobia. Far more people are killed by cars then snakes. Can you see like a, "Oh, there's a GMC." "Wow," you know, "Are those headlights or pits?" You know, so you know that there's a Stone Age brain and in many ways our impulses then aren't rational. So, this is something to remember when you're working with clients, because people differ in their sexual set point, which means, the moment at which you desire to have sex. And a lot of that difference is the hand of hormones you were dealt at conception. So, hopefully, this makes… this makes sense. So the set point is influenced by hormones, you've got the estrogen dominant individuals and again, it's… it's most women and some men. So, you can't have this stereotype about all men or all women. We have to think and that's why I think globally and more open mindedly, and that's why we have to really understand the client and yet put that in a smart context, and that's why I love continuums. So, who's the person with the high testosterone? Okay. This is a person that sort of walks around with sexual energy and sexual desire. This is a person that thinks about sex, fantasizes about sex, dreams about sex and they have, umm… a sexual desire that can be ignited very easily. This is also a person that builds up a lot of tension when they go without sex. So, that's very important to remember. This person gets physically, emotionally, psychologically fuzzy, cranky, and just irritable when they go without sex, 'cause it's almost like this… it is like a tension that builds up. These other descriptors, zest for life, drive, motivation, heightened response to anger, 'cause these are individuals that are more prone to hyper-arousal. We need this type of individual, person who's ready for action, you know, we also need the peace makers, don't we? But just know this sort of comes with that body. So, you have to understand this individual in their biological context. It also tends to decrease talking, socializing and talking about emotions unless it has a purpose, unless it has a context that makes sense. Why is that? An estrogen dominant person, if you look at a functional MRI and they're talking, they're getting little squirts of dopamine. They sort of get high from talking. But testosterone offsets the effects of that. So, it's not that high t… high testosterone individuals don't like talking, they just don't get high from it, so that it has to have a purpose. Whereas estrogen dominant individuals, just talking makes them feel high, okay. It suppresses traditional nurturing, and I say traditional because when we think of nurturing, think more of estrogen dominants, but we know the traditional male nurturing is so important, so important. So, we're not talking about male traditional nurturing, we're talking about the sensitive touching, feeling, talking. Okay. So, let's look at the… oops, lets go back to this one. Estrogen… Estrogen is the "make love not war". Uh… See what comes with estrogen, that verbal skills, social skills, empathic, imagination, creativity, insightfulness, sympathy and empathy, flexibility. This… These are the peace makers, these are the people who when faced with conflict, want to tend and mend, they want to move in and be friend. So you begin to see why it is an evolutionary advantage to have both, and these are individuals who will be sexual and will have desire and will have sexual energy when it's safe and there's connection and there's a relationship. The prerequisite for this person, because this person doesn't walk around with a body sex-ready, this person walks around ready for contact and intimacy, is… my stress has to be lowered, there has to connection, I have to feel like you're supporting me, and also I have to feel like you care. There's a connection, there's a relationship here. And kindness is an aphrodisiac for this person. Thoughtfulness is an aphrodisiac for this person. If you don't remember anything else, just remember this continuum and what turns you on, you know. This is a person for whom chore play works, you know, you do chores because you're lowing… lowering my stress, that's chore play, you know. That really works for this individual. Umm… Estrogen enhances communication between neurons, supports sexual receptivity and physical comfort. That's why you are helping me, you being there for me, you making me feel important, it literally enables me to feel desire. It's not an excuse, because vesoconstricting, which prevents any type of stress, everything tightens up. And this estrogen dominant person, and remember, it's almost a third of men, they have to have connection, they have to have that feeling of safety to feel that desire. Neutralizes aggression and regulates memory. Honey, do not argue with an estrogen dominant person, 'cause they will remember. If here she says, "You wore that denim shirt on the first date," you probably wore that denim shirt on the first date. Okay, if your estrogen goes down, uh-oh, you know, you want to look at this list because, again, you begin to see how all of this affects us, it really does affects us. And so you know that this is intrapersonal. I have to take care of myself, I can't let stress lower my estrogen. I can't use all my estrogen, 'cause stress can… can actually lower it. That's why you helping me and supporting me let's estrogen do its job, okay, makes me more receptive. So, what about sexual desire? I just call this the "sexy body/sexy brain", because what I've work with couples, they come to me, they all want a great sex life. But how do you get there? In all this time I've been working with couples, they basically want the same thing. But how you get there is the key, how you get there is the key. And so, let's look at this what it… this is what, this is a… this is a good visual. If you are a high testosterone person, getting to orgasm is pretty predictable, you know, 'cause you walk around with this quiescent ongoing desire. It doesn't take much stimulation for your… you to go to heightened arousal and then get up here to that wonderful plateau place where you want to stay forever 'cause you know orgasm is eminent, it's gonna happen, it just feels so good. And then there's this fireworks and there's orgasm, and then there's somewhat of resolution. By the way, most people end up, especially high testosterone people are narcoleptic right here, you can be a… you can get amnesia, you know, no complex thinking should occur, you know, which is sort of good news, 'cause if you want to get something, say, "Honey, do you really… let's… let's take that early vacation", right here is the time to ask, you know. So… And for males, there's a refractory period, then you can start all over. So… But you're getting to see how organized this is and predictable. But let me show you how that contrasts with the estrogen dominant person. I mean, 'cause you have to make a decision, you have to have a desire to desire. You make a decision and then you go to arousal and then think, "Oh, where is my desire? I need more stimulation? Oh, no, it's gone", you know, "I saw a dust on the ceiling and it's all over", you know, and you get up here and you just think it's just going to happen and then come back down here, more stimulation. And sometimes you just think, "I'll just fake it," you know, we won't talk about that. But the point is to be sensitive to the differences. This is why one size doesn't fit all, one theory doesn't fit all. Another continuum that I think is extremely important is monogamy. Monogamy isn't natural, non-monagan… non-monogamy isn't natural. What's natural is variety. And, that doesn't mean we can't be monogamous. But there are individuals, for whom monogamy is so… it's like you've been inoculated with the monogamy needle, and you have one day and you can't date anybody else, and you're so bonded to that person and… and… and you know, it's not even a deep relationship, but all… but because of that you attach to that individual because you're wired from monogamy. Then there are under… other individuals, it's not given, it really isn't as easy. It has to be a conscious choice, they don't have that natural bonding to one individual, and I think it's important to begin to understand that, that not all people are naturally monogamous, you know. We haven't practiced, but monogamy any… we've… we've… we've been in pair groups, but monogamy is not always the case. Isn't it? Even the little… now that we have DNA testing, even the species that we think are… are monogamous, not all of them are. You know, we have this wonderful fantasy about the little blue birds that are always… they're not always monogamous. In fact, you know what predicts if the female isn't monogamous? If she's a good forager, if she can catch her own worm, likely, she's not going to be monogamous. So, you make your own… you draw your own conclusions. Okay, one last continuum. Imagine you're on a hike. You see two people down there naked, there are having sex. Do you, A, get a better look, B, turn away or C, "Get a room!" You know, do you yell and them? I don't know. We know there's another continuum and it's from erotophobia, which is moving toward a natural curiosity and move… this is moving toward erotophilia and erotophobia is moving away. There are those who have a natural phobia around sexual stimulation, because sexual stimulation affects us all in many, many different ways. You begin to see some people are very comfortable with it, they have frequent sexual thoughts, they have a positive self-image, sexually active. That's a very different group. And can you overdo this? Absolutely, especially if it's mechanically enhanced with the Internet, with pornography, with chat rooms, etcetera. You can certainly overdo that. Erotophobia, you can certainly overdo that too, because this is a person that's private, and protective, selective, you know. Even your sexual thoughts, you feel disconcerting and you avoid this stimulation. And sex is not likely a priority and you begin to see how if this is your experience, which is largely cultural by the way. Many of us grew up in an environment that promoted this. So, it's important to know that we're also on that continuum. Doesn't mean you have to stay there, but isn't that good to know about yourself? And this starts to tell you where to plan your intervention when you're working with people. Can you take this to the extreme? You know, sexual anorexia, people can have a panic response, get sick at their stomach and that's where… when you have a strong reaction like that, then you begin to know where to plant your intervention. So, this is another continuum to… are you more on the erotophobia end, so you would know where to plan your intervention, to begin looking at your history, where you learned this, earning… learning to regulate these emotions. Erotophilia, also you have to say where, where is it that I go out of bounds, you know, where are the limits here? Yes, I'm sexually curious. Yes, I'd love the attention of others. But what about my commitment to my partner, what about my commitment to myself, how much do I follow this natural curiosity? Because these are issues that are going to come up with you when you're working with people. So, let's sort of summarize what we've said. It's complex, one size doesn't fit all, some approaches work some of the time, you got to understand your client, you got to be smart, your treatment has to make sense. There are many continuums to go on, but we know that if you will listen to your client… You know, the longer I work, here's what I know, how I calm myself and tune into my client and keep up with my research, keep up with my education, and plan treatment that really, really makes sense, the more successful I'm gonna be and the more successful the clients think they're gonna be. Thank you for your attention. I've really enjoyed this.
