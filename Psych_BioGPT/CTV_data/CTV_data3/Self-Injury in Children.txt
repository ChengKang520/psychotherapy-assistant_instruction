Keeping Kids Healthy 

00:00:50
WINNIE KING , M.D. Hello, I am Dr. Winnie King and I’m here with a family and some experts in the lobby of the Children’s hospital at Monterfiore in New York City. So you can expect to hear and see some activity in the background this all part of the environment. There is a very disturbing trend going on in the world of teenagers. It’s called self-injury or self-mutilation and you need to know about it because the practice is actually on the rise, it’s defined as a delivered harming of your own body, such as burning or cutting yourself, without a conscious attempted suicide, it’s amazingly common. Believe it or not in a Massachusetts survey almost a fifth of the high school students reported that they had injured themselves on purpose in the last year. Now a lot of people react with horror at the practice and may simply label these self-injuring kids as crazy, but stigmatizing them doesn’t help understand or solve the problem. Today we’re going to learn what’s going on in a young person’s mind to make them want to hurt themselves. And most importantly what you can do to stop it. Here is the story of one young women as cutting slowly became a part of her life. 

00:01:55
THEA ROWAN 15 Years Old The girl that had been my best friend started to cut and she didn’t directly tell me that she was cutting herself, but I saw the marks and after she began to cut and that became a whole big deal, but my other friends were interest and after just being immersed in it for a few months and just having everyone talk about it all time, I decided to try it. 

00:02:20
SUSAN ROWAN Thea’s Mother It was not a thought that crossed my mind that Thea might do this. I think I was surprised that she had experimented, because she had been so upset about her friend. 

00:02:30
THEA ROWAN I only did it few times in seventh grade and it didn’t seem to do much, but then when 9th grade started, I was stressed out with a bunch of stuff and then I started to get into it really heavily and I didn’t make any effort to stop. I remember it was the last period of the day and I was in earth science and I was just over rated with some sort of anxiety, I was using my finger nail and I scratched my head till it blood and it happened so fast and before I know it like my sides bleeding and I was kind of covered it up. I figured it was just elapse of judgment. But I kept on doing it and I was doing it (inaudible )times a day after that. And it did somehow provided some sort of relief, I would cut instead of doing homework and it was just, it became so controlling that everything else. 

00:03:20
SUSAN ROWAN Thea sister Shana was having some difficulties and she have been having ongoing difficulties. 

00:03:25
THEA ROWAN She had been to the main at well I say attraction and it makes it sound positive, but she wasn’t made attraction in the family and I was always kind of on the down low. No, like I was neglected or anything, but my sister when she got mad, she would scream and when I got mad I wouldn’t do anything about it. So I kind of, I… I just stayed back. 

00:03:45
SUSAN ROWAN Part of the situation with Shana includes lots of drama, loud arguments plus there was, I think real worry about um… Shana’s well being. 

00:04:00
THEA ROWAN Being the “Good Child,” because my sister had always been the one getting in trouble, I kind of took it upon myself to be a peace keeper, but I would… I was so sad because it wasn’t working. Often when I would cut it would be at night, I would be upstairs, my… the rest of my family will be downstairs and they would usually be arguing over the stupidest things like; my sister might have left the dish out and she didn’t put it away and they’d ask her to and she wouldn’t, and they were escalating to saying that was so much bigger than it really was. If we get into screaming and sometime you know one of them would slam the door and just take a walk and it… it was same routine whenever they’d arguing. So the anger I was feeling was towards them not even seeing that I was up in my room and they were all down here like I wasn’t even there. And in a little way it was a cry out for attention, but of course they weren’t up there and they didn't know I was doing it. Leading up to it I'd almost still known, that was a way that I was angry, but I would feel so shaky like totally overcome with something else that I was beside myself with whatever emotion it was and cutting and seeing blood it almost reminds you like you’re there, it reminds that you’re real and it kind of would bring me back to reality. 

00:05:15
RUDD ROWAN Thea’s Father There was a time… when Shana’s needs were so great and Thea really put her in needs dead last and really had no voice and we learned that only after it had become a burden too great. 

00:05:35
THEA ROWAN Sometime I myself so proud and other time I thought it was really pathetic that I was stooping so low try to make myself feel better and I was just secluding myself in this own dark, corner of my mind. 

00:05:50
SUSAN ROWAN We discovered Thea was cutting, I felt very worried, I felt and I felt baddy for Thea. 

00:05:55
RUDD ROWAN Worried that… that I or we had not properly evaluated the… a difficulty that we had in a fact, um… created in our home and worried about the effect, worried about the future. 

00:06:15
WINNIE KING Well that’s such an incredible story and thank you so much Thea for being here and being willing to talk about it. You actually had to go into the hospital for this. 

00:06:25
THEA ROWAN I did. 

00:06:25
WINNIE KING And what was that like? 

00:06:25
THEA ROWAN It was an eye opening experience more like a soap on the face because it didn’t feel good, it was hard. I was in the hospital with girls that were addicted to something much worst, they were drug addicts, they were junkies. They had their track marks and I had my cuts. 

00:06:40
WINNIE KING Hmm… Hmm… 

00:06:40
THEA ROWAN But I realized that I was aware of what my problems were and I knew what I had to do to get better and these girls didn’t. 

00:06:50
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:06:50
THEA ROWAN Like they were so far deep into what they were doing that they… they didn’t want trying to get better and I knew that I had to. 

00:06:55
WINNIE KING Yeah, you did. 

00:06:55
WINNIE KING And I… 

00:06:55
WINNIE KING And you had a great support system with your family. 

00:07:00
THEA ROWAN I did. 

00:07:00
WINNIE KING And your parents are here today Rudd and Susan. Thank you for… for coming today. Are you guys better able to talk about this now? 

00:07:05
SUSAN ROWAN Oh yes. 

00:07:05
WINNIE KING Yeah with other is it something that you can… you can share how you are feeling? 

00:07:10
RUDD ROWAN Yeah we’re fortunate to have a been working in family therapy for a couple of years now and… and well it was a… a difficult period of time find our way there. Now that we’re there, we have a vehicle it means by which to speak and… and get to know ourselves. 

00:07:30
WINNIE KING Yeah, well therapy certainly works. You know Dr. Alec Miller works with Rowan family and he is the Chief of art lesson Psychology at Montefiore Medical Center and Dr. Barry Walsh is the Doctor of Clinical Social Work and the author of several books on self-injury including treating self-injury a practical guide and Barry let’s start out with the definition, what do we mean, when we say self-injury? 

00:07:50
BARRY WALSH , Ph.D. Doctor of Clinical Social Work Self-injury is when people hurt their bodies on purpose usually without suicidal intent and they do it to reduce emotional distress. 

00:08:00
WINNIE KING Give me some examples of the way in which they do it. 

00:08:05
BARRY WALSH Well the most common example is that one Thea mentioned, cutting, but there are many other types such as self burning, self hitting, excoriation of wounds, which is to open an existing wound, piercing scratching and so on. 

00:08:20
WINNIE KING Yeah, the things that… parents might not necessarily pick up on right away that this represents an actually attempt to get cry out for help. 

00:08:25
BARRY WALSH Sometimes kids will say that this happened accidently, the cat scratched them, the dog nicked them or whatever but when you see in a establish pattern developing it’s pretty clear, it’s a self inflicted problem. 

00:08:40
WINNIE KING Alec why… why do they do this? 

00:08:40
ALEC MILLER , Psy.D Psychologist I think we’ve first had the challenge some common misconceptions about why people do it. One is that if someone hurt themselves they want automatically suicide, they rush to the hospital that’s not necessarily. So, the other is that, it’s just a attention seeking we shouldn’t take it seriously, so let’s ignore it. 

00:08:55
WINNIE KING Hmm… Hmm… 

00:08:55
ALEC MILLER So those are things… it well, it could be a attention seeking, it could be suicide but often not that. Some of the most common functions of self-injury include punishing one self, communicating distress to other people that I am in pain and I… you need to know that. Ah… another one has to do with regulating emotions how to… if someone is angry and anxious how cutting might function to down regulator, reduce their intensity of emotions. Just like someone who is numb or someone who feels empty. 

00:09:25
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:09:25
DR. ALEC MILLER Cutting themselves might cause into feel something it feel a lot. 

00:09:30
WINNIE KING Well you see a lot of children in your practice, or you seeing more of this cutting behavior now? 

00:09:30
ALEC MILLER Yes the (inaudible ) has increased in last several years. 

00:09:35
WINNIE KING And do you see a difference in the sexes more in girls, more in boys? 

00:09:40
ALEC MILLER Historically it was girls more than boys, but I think boys have definitely shown that they're involved as much as they are as girls are these days. 

00:09:45
WINNIE KING Well Barry self-injury is… is more prevalent you know, is that… is that the case? 

00:09:50
BARRY WALSH , Ph.D. Author, Treating Self-Injury: A Practical Guide Absolutely. It’s an amazing development, self-injury is been around since the 60s. In disturbed people who have trauma histories and spent a lot of times in hospitals or group homes or special education, but the amazingly recent, the amazing recent development is now it’s occurring frequently in middle schools, high schools, young adults. I even have clients in my case who one of them was selected prom queen this year and the other is the captain of her softball team. 

00:10:15
WINNIE KING Wow. 

00:10:20
BARRY WALSH To put together self-injury with such accomplishments would have been unthinkable a few years ago. 

00:10:25
WINNIE KING When you… When you talk about why a child you know does this. Do you speculate is to why? 

00:10:30
BARRY WALSH Well you know there is not any research yet on these middle school and high school self-injurers, but there are some speculations about why it might be surfacing in these more competent kids and one of them is that this kid, this generation of children seems to be more distressed than previous generations. Learning self-soothing skills informally doesn’t seem to have happened this much. A lot of them are in thread mills of activities, many of which are competitive and then there is the issue of direct media influences, websites, chat rooms, music videos, movies all of which feature and sometimes sensationalize self-injury seem to have an influence on today’s (inaudible ). 

00:11:12
WINNIE KING Well, now Thea you’re listening to these fabulous experts here that know a lot about this from their experience working with children, but um… you talk to kids, you know in your everyday life at school and around your friends. Is this something that's accepted in very common? 

00:11:25
THEA ROWAN Common, yes accepted. Um… it, you know people might go and get high together. 

00:11:35
WINNIE KING Hmm… Hmm… 

00:11:35
THEA ROWAN If they’re on drugs, but it’s not like people get together and cut themselves. 

00:11:35
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:11:40
THEA ROWAN And well they are might be looking for the same results as the people that are getting high together they don’t carry it out in the same way. 

00:11:45
WINNIE KING Do you feel like there is so shame with this even though they’re doing it are they… are they shameful about it? 

00:11:50
THEA ROWAN They are well might be, I mean um… some people almost feel proud they want to show it off, but beneath that it’s a lot of shame and secrecy. 

00:12:00
WINNIE KING Yeah. Well we’re going to listen to the words of some other teens about their own self-injury experiences. 

00:12:05
DESIREE 17 Years Old The cutting was about the releasing of the anger and frustration that I felt. Physically it was leaving marks, it was leaving scars. Mentally it… it felt power, it felt like it was giving me power at the time that I could control something. 

00:12:20
AMANDA 15 Years Old It kind of takes my emotional pain and… and put that into physical pain instead. 

00:12:30
ASHLEY 17 years Old I would rather have the physical pain than the emotional pain, because I can watch it heal. 

00:12:30
I did for that (inaudible ) that feeling nothing and don’t care if I wasn’t happy and if I didn’t feel good, it was just nothing. 

00:12:40
AMANDA Cutting makes me feel really calm, it calms me down when I’m angry, it… I don’t know why it’s just kind of sooth me for a while. 

00:12:50
JESSICA 16 years Old I guess I am making my choice to cut myself, because you can always walk away, but it’s a hard choice because sometime it’s just nothing to walk away to. 

00:13:00
“Can You See My Pain” Courtesy: NEWIST/CESA7 

00:13:00
DESIREE I honestly believe that I stopped cutting because of the support that I found was in my family and from the counselor, I figured that if they could work so hard to help me and to like me for who I really was, maybe I should find out who I really was and like me too. 

00:13:20
WINNIE KING Thea you just heard these comments from these girls that are cutting themselves to anything sounds familiar? 

00:13:25
THEA ROWAN Well the third girl talking about taking the emotional pain and turning it into physical pain, so you could watch it heal. That I think for me and I can imagine for anyone who’s ever cut themselves and dealt with it that’s really easy to relate to because that’s exactly what you’re trying to end. 

00:13:45
WINNIE KING Hmm… Hmm… 

00:13:45
THEA ROWAN The emotional pain… 

00:13:45
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:13:45
THEA ROWAN …and to see it heal is what your aim is. 

00:13:50
WINNIE KING Yeah, well Alec what about the comment from the young women there was nothing to walk away to? 

00:13:55
ALEC MILLER , Psy.D. Montefiore Medical Center Hmm…hmm…(inaudible )you feel empty and feel like there is not a… the filling aspect of their life and part of the therapy involves building a life worth living form figuring out what to do to feel more fulfilled so you don’t resort to these kinds of behaviors. 

00:14:10
WINNIE KING Well Barry what about the comment about the uncomfortable emotions? Are these children being discouraged to express their emotions is that… is that what this is coming from? 

00:14:15
BARRY WALSH It’s really a very wide range. In some of the kids self injure a very inhibited, they don’t express their emotions and the self-injury allows them to bring what’s internal and make it external. For other people if they're emotionally very intense, explosive and the self-injury helps them bring that back down. So there is really an incredible range of effective experience for the self-injurers. 

00:14:40
WINNIE KING So should we be blaming parents that have children who cut themselves? 

00:14:40
BARRY WALSH Definitely not many of the parents are self-injurers particularly in this new healthier group, they are concerned involved parents they’re doing the best as do they can and yet these kids emerge with a self destructive behavior and it’s often very encouraging that the parents are (inaudible ) around that child and move towards getting help as these folks have. 

00:15:00
WINNIE KING Well how can a parent know if their child is doing this, what, what should they be looking for? 

00:15:05
BARRY WALSH Well the most obvious way is you start to see scars or wounds on the body. Or um… children are wearing clothing that masks their arms or legs or a lot of bracelets and it really seems like something is going on that isn’t being expressed. 

00:15:20
WINNIE KING Hmm… Hmm… 

00:15:20
BARRY WALSH But another tip off is intense emotion des-regulation, which seems to go beyond normal limits. 

00:15:30
WINNIE KING Yeah, what about emotional cues? Is there is anything that they would just, that they would display emotionally that might tip a parent off? 

00:15:35
BARRY WALSH The main… The main emotions that proceeds self-injury are anxiety, shame, anger, depression, sadness. 

00:15:40
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:15:45
BARRY WALSH The trouble is lots of adolescence have some muted version of that. 

00:15:45
WINNIE KING Right. 

00:15:45
BARRY WALSH What makes this different is it’s even more intense and prolonged. 

00:15:50
WINNIE KING Okay, now… suppose you’ve… you’ve got a parent that’s say okay, I think that my child maybe doing this. This sounds very familiar, what’s the next step? 

00:16:00
BARRY WALSH Well there is some good rules of thumb about how to proceed and how not to proceed. The first things is don’t confuse the behavior with suicide unless there is a lot of physical damage that’s usually not the case. The second is hysteria is not helpful, adding more emotion to an emotionally distressed kid is not helpful. What is helpful is to respond in a low key dispassionate demeanor, not try to leap into prohibiting or preventing the behavior initially, but rather try to understand what is this behavior doing for your child, what are they managing via this behavior so you can move towards help. 

00:16:35
WINNIE KING So you don’t run into their room and demand that they roll their sleeves up? 

00:16:40
BARRY WALSH As you know with adolescence intrusive inspections tend to not do very well. 

00:16:45
WINNIE KING They don’t go very well. 

00:16:45
WINNIE KING No they back fire big time. 

00:16:50
WINNIE KING Yeah and the same way happens in this case. Um… it’s not unusual for children to deny things to, what happens when you've got a kid that you suspect is cutting themselves or doing something else that’s harmful and they are looking at you and they are saying you’re crazy, stop bothering me, there is nothing wrong with me, I’m not doing that? 

00:17:05
BARRY WALSH The parent should be patient, the parent can also say you know, I know this is a fairly common behavior among teens these days. You may not want to talk to me about it right now, but maybe later in the day at a better movement you could tell me the truth about this, I'm convinced you’re a self-injuring, you’re not going to be in trouble about this. We’re going to work on this together. 

00:17:25
WINNIE KING Yeah, they're not in trouble thing, I think it’s really, really important well, Susan and Rudd you know that Thea had this… had this problem at some point in her life. Now that she’s got in help and she is clearly doing so much better. Do you still like have this urge to kind of spy on her a little bit and kind of check and make sure that she isn’t back sliding? I mean, how do you get to a point where you don’t , you don’t worry about it anymore? 

00:17:50
SUSAN ROWAN Thea, pretty often um… if she has a slip up, she tells us and she… she tells us quickly and it’s usually, you know it’s not dramatic cut, a little… little thing. Um… no we’re beyond the checking ah… 

00:18:10
WINNIE KING So you don’t have like hidden cameras in the bathroom… 

00:18:10
SUSAN ROWAN No. 

00:18:15
WINNIE KING …in the closet, maybe like checking up on her every move. Great yeah you’ve move beyond that. 

00:18:15
SUSAN ROWAN Hmm… Hmm… 

00:18:20
RUDD ROWAN And what we, I think thanks so much to the… to the therapy work we’re doing as a family. Um… there has been a… an accountability that has grown in our work together. Um… and I think the each of us is… is very thankful to have that… that to work with, work through anything that might come along. 

00:18:40
WINNIE KING Yeah, well Alec um… when a parent suspects that there is something going on and suppose there is bleeding because there is been cutting… 

00:18:50
ALEC MILLER Hmm… Hmm… 

00:18:50
WINNIE KING It’s so tempting to really freak out you know and you made the important point Barry that this doesn’t necessarily represents suicide and so it doesn’t need to be treated that way, but what do you do, I mean the first thing, I would think a lot of parents would do is, you know call 911, you know go to the emergency room. What do you do? 

00:19:00
ALEC MILLER Well in severe cases that… there may be necessary but other, less severe cases you want to talk to your child in a non judgmental open ended way and say you are concern. You want to consider having them seeing by someone in the schools setting, if your school therapist or a guides counselor or social worker psychologist or go into the community and have a professional see them, but it really urge people to see someone, and its expertise in the area of self-cutting and self-injury. 

00:19:30
WINNIE KING Yeah, yeah this isn’t some we don’t go to a general practitioner or even that to be honest with you as a doctor, even a medical doctor who doesn’t treat this, is not going to be very helpful and they going to approach it in the wrong way. So someone who has expertise like you guys in this type of… 

00:19:40
ALEC MILLER Hmm… Hmm… 

00:19:45
WINNIE KING …treatment is the way to go. 

00:19:45
ALEC MILLER Right and you should ask the professional, you could look at websites, but you should investigate that. 

00:19:50
WINNIE KING Okay, so Alec what type of treatment is being used? 

00:19:55
ALEC MILLER One of the most effective treatments for this problem is called Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which is an advance form of cognitive behavior therapy and that involves working on changeling peoples thoughts recognitions and also changing behaviors, figuring out how to replace maladapted behaviors like cutting and self-injury with more skillful behaviors. So we have a whole curriculum of skills we teach individuals and families and how to more effectively manage that. Some of these include mind form the skills, to teach individuals how to be more aware of what their feeling in the moment non judgmentally. We’re teach distress tolerance skills, how do you distract or self-sooth instead of cutting, by listening to some music or to light a scented candle, take a bath or read or write or so on. Ah… we teach emotion regulation skills, we teach interpersonal effectiveness skills. So these are useful for teens and families together and… and trying to be quite effective. 

00:20:45
WINNIE KING Well for Thea the treatment does seem to helping. Let’s watch. 

00:20:50
THEA ROWAN Say it’s like a 20 storey building and in 9th grade I was probably like in the first floor being the worst and now I think I’m somewhere on the of 13th. But I see I really do know that I’m still struggling. I like to draw and I also figer skate, but I’ve been dancing since I was three, I think. So it’s… it’s always been something that I’ve… I’ve liked, but when I started to get really depressed it became more of an outlet for emotion and after hitting the low point and realizing I’m trying to get better, it’s became even more (inaudible ) and I’ve been kind of using it actively as a, a way to feel better. And writing, I’ve been writing since 7th grade, when I first tried you know to realize that all my friends were harming themselves and it just really helps me, if I’m feeling really impulsive, if you write it down then you read it over and I am like it sounds so stupid, I can’t do this. When I cut you know more recently in a past few months. Um… it’s been with more time in-between and when I do its actually feeling now, I actually feel pain. And I’ve… And I’ve to stop because I realize it’s different than it was. It’s definitely a positive thing, it’s just make you really tell where I am with myself and what’s going on. And that, the stuff I wearing is to me is progress. 

00:22:15
SUSAN ROWAN I can’t say that I live with the fear of… of Thea doing this, I think she does flirt with it. Um… but I also have a sense of Thea really trying hard to overcome it. So if there are slips, it’s hard, it’s… it’s like an addiction, but I see too much progress to really feel fear. 

00:22:45
THEA ROWAN I have more of an idea what triggers me and I make more of an effort to stop it, if I seeing it starting and being in therapy still it’s really helpful and the family I'm in, how they're so aware of stuff that lot of parents don’t know and being able to talk with them about it. 

00:22:55
WINNIE KING Thea looks like you’ve come a long way. 

00:22:55
THEA ROWAN Yeah and I’m, I agree with that. As I talked about the building I it’s… I agree with that analogy and I really feel it being aware of what I’ve have done and being aware of my feelings and knowing what’s make me feel bad and knowing how to reverse it… 

00:23:15
WINNIE KING Hmm… Hmm… 

00:23:20
THEA ROWAN …once I do start to feel bad, it’s really the key to feeling better. 

00:23:20
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:23:20
THEA ROWAN And being in therapy and… 

00:23:25
WINNIE KING Well now Barry I understand that you use what’s called replacement behaviors in your therapy and tell us about that. 

00:23:30
BARRY WALSH Well replacement skills are essentially important to giving up self-injury in that. You need to be able to manage your emotion in other ways that work as well in as self-injury in reducing the distress. Thea mentioned that couple of that are relevant to her like dancing and writing. For other people it could be breathing, exercise, journaling, listening to music or some of the other skills that Alec mentioned. 

00:23:50
WINNIE KING Hmm… Hmm… 

00:23:50
BARRY WALSH It really as instead of cutting to manage emotions, what can I do instead that can clam myself or communicate my needs. 

00:24:00
WINNIE KING But you still do need to get to root cause of what’s going on with the child. 

00:24:00
BARRY WALSH Well you do need to figure out what are the triggers that bring this behavior into (inaudible ) and that would include family problems or relationship issues um… historical problems in terms of things that have happened in the family, academic pressures and so on. 

00:24:15
WINNIE KING Yeah, you know Alec we’ve heard about um… how to talk to your child if their cutting, but how do you treat them? How do you act around them? 

00:24:25
ALEC MILLER Well I think with families it’s very important to approach it dialectically and what I mean by that is on the one hand validate your child and say I understand you are in pain, I understand this is distressing, I get that and at the same time, I really want you to work on to discontinue with that behavior figuring out other ways of coping that don’t involve self-harm. So both acceptance of the child and need for change. 

00:24:45
WINNIE KING Yeah and parents have to do a little self evaluation too don't they? 

00:24:50
