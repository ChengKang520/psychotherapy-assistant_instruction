Y. BARRA CHUNG  Good morning.

 Good morning.

 Good morning. 

00:00:30
Y. BARRA CHUNG How you doing? Thanks, thanks for coming in this morning. It's my privilege to uh, be here to share some thoughts with you and I am hoping that we're in same direction because we have some experts here and everybody has some uh, experience with uh, multiculture education in Psychology and so, uh, my title today is Multiculturalism in Psychology Education and Training and first of all, I wanna share with, uh, with you some statistics that I found uh, from the APA uh, uh, uh, report. One is when we look at the site, uh, Bachelors Degree of Psychology Graduates back uh, in 2003 and 2004, you will see the majority uh, was to uh, White Americans and you see nine percent is the green part. Nine percent will be Hispanic Americans, 11 percent will be African Americans. So Asian Americans are a little, a little more over what we have presented but all the racial minorities, the ethnic minorities are underrepresented in is being the bachelor's level. If you'll look at Master's level was again White Americans costs the majority and we have eight percent of Hispanic Americans. Fourteen percent, interestingly enough, we kinda have a little more increase uh, in this figure for African Americans. And uh, Asian Americans are just about the, the national uh, uh, percentage. And then, if you look at the Doctoral level of psychology training this is the, the uh, comparison. The blue uh, chart would indicate you as population and the red would mean how many, how uh, many actually has Psychology graduate at the Doctoral level. So if you look at the top bar, you see uh, for White Americans, uh, they're overrepresented by quite a bit and the, the blue it would be the U.S. population. And the other uh, group that has some uh, over representation will be Asian Americans. Uh, see, where is it? Yeah, right here. Six percent of the doctoral graduates in Psychology are Asian Americans compared with uh, 4.3 percent in the U.S. population. Off the other racial and ethnic minorities are underrepresented. Hispanic Americans is uh, a major kind of difference uh, only 6.2 percent on Hispanic compared to 14.4 percent uh, nationally. Also in the case of uh, Ethnic Americans, uh, right here. Only 4.4 percent Doctoral graduates uh, Ethnic Americans compared to 12.8 percent nationally. Of course, American Indians are also un, underrepresented. Four point, uh, .4 percent only compared to just about one percent nationally. So, we, we see uh, the trend from Bachelors level up to the Doctoral level uh, racial minorities maybe except, with exception of Asian Americans are underrepresented. What about uh, student affiliates of APA. You see majorities would be White and then, you see it even strike in a small number of uh, racial minorities five percent, Hispanics, six percent, uh, African Americans and five percent in Asian, one percent uh, American Indians. With that in mind, APA is very concerned about the underrepresentation of Racial and Ethnic minorities uh, in Psychology training and also of an organizational membership and so, what they wanted to do is to make every effort in having more Racial minorities in A, APA governance. And so this is the progress that uh, APA has made. Uh, the blue will be back in 19, 1997 and the red will be in 2004. So in all categories we have been successful in placing more Racial and Ethnic minorities in APA governance. I think that is a very good thing but the other side of that is sometimes they make people some illusion. If they look at APA governance they see more Racial minorities. They may form a, an opinion about APA which is not true and if you look at membership a lot. So I think that, that due in size to this I, I'm, I'm very encouraged that the APA is doing all the efforts in, in ensuring representation of uh, Racial minorities, but we got to make sure that in terms of membership recruitments and mentoring uh, and especially from uh, student to uh, professional often times we lose a lot of members and a lot of times there'd be racial minorities that we, we are missing. So with that in me, my mind, I wanna talk a little bit about affirmative action because this has been a very hot topic and very controversial. We have seen some mistakes that have been talking about the retirement of affirmative action. One uhm, one thing I, I, I, I, I think would be useful for us to think about affirmative action is that we have just held the Olympics uh, uh, in Beijing uh, last August, and I was not able to be there but uh, so with that still fresh in mind I want, I want this me, use of metaphor of a track and field uh, competition. So, if you look at a, a 100 meter competition, you may see that this is the finish line and then you can place suppose I, the dots will, (inaudible ), and this is a person of color and this is the White person. So if it, if it's a, a 100 meter, you place everybody in the same spot and the finish line at the same spot, that seems to be quite fair. However, when it comes to uh, the education and training of Racial and Ethnic minorities is not a simple as a 100 uh, meter competition. What I conceptualize is a small like a 200 meter competition. It's not totally accurate, I just write there but just, you know, bare with me. That's supposed, this is the line that people draw, this is a 200 meter uh, starting point, and if people are thinking that, we don't, we didn't need the affirmative action because we are there already, uh, we, we have to open the structure, everybody uh, has the equal uh, access in treatment, in education, uh, and in a workplace. So the, that will be pretty much like we are placing everybody at that line for the 200 meter. What is lacking is that we don't know that the person of color entry has go the outer circle. And that means there are more to one. This maybe 100 meter, this is not a 100 meter. What is the extra effort then? The historical and current discrimination. The alternative structure that has not been available to Racial and Ethnic minorities. So, we are ignoring all these factors that, so that people actually have to want a lot more if you place it by the, at the same starting point with though any kind of uh, recognition and provision of resources available to Racial and Ethnic minorities. So this is actually not a very frightening(ph) as it, as supposed if anybody wanna run in uh, Olympics. Nobody would, would agree to running a race like that. And so, to, I just felt that just like the Olympics, there are different starting points for the, for the race. So that way we recognize that people actually have to want more. So it's not like, this image provides some, some sort of visual kind of disadvantage that limited, the, the White person actually would have to run longer at least, uh, actually it's not true. So, I think some, what is perception differences will be that people are seeing the picture differently and ignoring the fact that Racial and eth, Ethnic minorities had a lot more to do with in terms of barriers, in order to come to the same ending point. Uh, I as uh, a, personal example. I, I sometimes feel I, I need to work three times as hard just to achieve the same kind of uh, uh, achievements as a White person may, may, maybe able to. Simply because of the opportunity structure and the discrimination that I may, may encounter in my education, in, in my publishing and, and so forth. The next thing I want to, to, to talk about is the, the Null Environment. 

00:08:25
The "Null" Environment" Is That Enough? Equal and open opportunity structure Color-blind approach The case of Andy 

00:08:25
Y. BARRA CHUNG How many have you heard of this term, the Null Environment? Nobody? I see one. Nancy Betz uh, for decades ago I actually had talked about the Null Environment, uh, we, we got to women's uh, career developments. Should it thought that uh, at, at some point in time people thought uh, the opportunity search(ph) is so equal between men and women, so we don't need to actively, we could entertain women in education. Uh, and she called it a Null Environment. It mean it's so mutual uh, everything is on the equal plain when in fact that is not necessarily the case in the case of women. So when argument was that we do have equal and open opportunity structure. And they thought that all women are able to vote now. They are, they, they had the same chance of going to, to higher education as men and also the same chance for getting scholarships and so why would make gender an issue or race for that matter an issue. And, and so especially the reason that we have a backlash on a, the, the White privilege and if people feel like White, uh, especially heterosexual White men are being disadvantaged. So the, the kind of argument to, to that will be to in, introduce a Null Environment. It mean that we don't need special scholarships, or, or any kind of resources or special considerations, the door is open for everybody, so we called it Null Environment. Another part is the Color-blind approach and I've heard a lot in, uh, more recently in uh, in one conversation with uh, one uh, president that uh, I was conversing with at Harvard University and uh, we were talking about uh, an interesting fact that uh, in one hiring year, we hired two uh, uh, Asians of co, uh, Asian of color uh in the faculty. And then he said that, that, that's fine but if, if you uh, look at in California than you know, that the, the better push will be to not make race a matter and everybody will be becoming here the same way, and I did not uh, this is already changing. That change him at that time because that was the first time we met and, but I was, I was like this is exactly the microaggression in the, in the, in the category of uh, micro-invalidation uh, because you cannot just ignore the very nature that I am a man or I am a nation. There's something that you, you look at and subconsciously you react to people that way. Uhm, even though one person personally may not have allowed discrimination against it the other person, but that comment ignores the society of discrimination that is at large. So, with that in mind I wanna share with you a, a, an interesting story uh, the case of Andy just to have us understand a little more about what that means to provide a Null Environment. Andy actually was my dog. He was a, a black Labrador retriever. And a few years ago, uh, I had to go to the American Counseling Association for conference and so I, uh, I was gonna bought my dog in a kennel uh, unfortunately, I didn't make advance reservation so my regular kennel was not available. So, I frantically has, has, had to find another kennel to bought my dog. And so uh, I find this kennel I've never been to, uh, I don't know what they're like but somehow I was desperate to have to find a, a kennel. And so I went there and bought my dog and a few days later I came back. So when I, when I was uh, try to getting ready to pay for the fee and, and, and retrieving my dog and the dog came out I was like, "Oh, just a few days and you don't even, even recognize me." And then, I was just joking about that and then I, I took the dog and as we proceeding to my car and my car had the carrier in, in the backseat and so my dog knows exactly how to get, get in to the crate uh, in the backseat. That dog did not know how to do that. I was like, "That's strange." So, the more I look at that dog, I thought, "This is not my dog." (laughs) And so I went back to the, to the hospital I said, "I don't think this is my dog. It looks just like my dog but it's not." And they said, "No, over this weekend there's only one black Labrador as yours." And I said, "Are you sure about that?" They said, "Yes, absolutely sure." And so I said, "Okay, I'm gonna take it back." So I took the dog back and the behavior is totally different. Uh, I have my, mis, very special ways of training my dog where my dog can go, where he could not go and uhm, indoor-outdoor behavior not that he had to pat(ph) in. But somehow this dog was totally different. He was, he's extremely a, attached, he has always been like within, within one feet uh, from, from me and uh, he would chew up at the doghouse and, and everything else. And I was, I was really miserable. I was convinced that this, was not my dog but uhm, but they denied that it was, it was not the case. And finally I, I made the phone call, I said, "I need for you to find the information uh, and, and verify that whether this is my dog or not. In the meantime, I'm gonna send this dog back to you in kennel because it has caused a lot of damage in my house already. And if you cannot find the answer I'm gonna proceed with legal action." And so that worked and uh, that one night later, the, the owner uh, called me and said that, "I'm sorry, there was a mistake." Uh, it was true when they said that uh, when I bought my dog there was, there was no other black Labrador. But that weekend somebody bought in a black Labrador for vaccination and he was, he was there for a few hours and they've believed that it was at that time that the dog got swapped. And so I said, I said, "Okay, let's arrange for a reunion then." And, and so we did. It was just like in movie, two cars parked in the, in the parking lot at the same time, we open the door at, at the same time and the door, and the dogs went to the respective owners. It's just like a perfect movie. (laughs) Uhm, but when I got my dog back uh, I've noticed that my dog had, behavior had change. Uhm, and, and, and I get it there the small facts to what happened. My dog was an indoor dog. He only go outside to do his business. The other dog was an outdoor dog. He had, he did not have the privilege to come in and my dog barks, the other dog doesn't bark. And these are the very crucial facts because I supposed the own, the other owner would keep my dog Andy outside and he would bark. And when he bark and the, when the guy open the petter(ph) door to, uh, and, and Andy of course, would wanna come in and I, I've believed that the, uh, that's when Andy was abused. When he would open the, the door and stop him from barking. And so what happened to, to Andy was that ever since that whenever my dog went out, I opened the, the petter(ph) door to let him come in he would not come in. I'll say, "Come on just come in. Uh, come on sweetie, come in." He would not come in, he was so scared. Uh, and what would take for him to come in is that when I get down on my knees and say "come on, come on," I pat him and then, he would come in. Now, I'm telling this a long story to illustrate a point about Null Environment and it may seem a little funny what was a dog have to do with human beings, but we can actually learn a lot from a dog. What happened was that my dog was abused. When a dog was a, abused, even though he was coming back to his own owner who never abused him, it never wash out the trauma. And so, the Null Environment will be equivalent to me, opening my petter(ph) door and say, "Come on sweetie just come in." Open door policy and it did not work. My dog was abused, he was so afraid, he will not come in with that kind of open gesture until I'm, I'm making extra step, get down on my knees, and, and, and pat him. That is the extra step that would need to correct for the Null Environment. So the implication of that is when, when we're dealing with women, racial minorities, ethnic minorities people have been oppressed and abused and, and discriminated against in many ways and therefore, logically they would have a lot of guardedness about how other people will treat them. And that is the way of defending for themselves even though sometimes it may not be totally rational, just like when my dog dealing with me, the, the, the owner of all times. But the psychological effect was there. And so that is what it takes to correct for the Null Environment and that relates to affirmative action too, when people said that we don't need affirmative action. Yes, we do. We are not there yet. So in our topics is Diversity equal to Multiculturalism? 

00:17:00
Statistics versus attitudes and competence Quota and lip service Diverse body as a deception to self and others Multiculturalism requires commitment and efforts of all 

00:17:00
Y. BARRA CHUNG What do you think? Do you think that equal? Interesting enough when I was in my previous uh, employment place and because I'm being videotape, I don't wanna name any specific university or persons, uhm, but we had a racial uh, crisis at my previous employment. Uh, we had an incident when uh, a sorority, uh, have a party and some people were coming painting the flick, the face black. And that caused a lot of controversy, it hurt a lot of people and it became even a national news. And so the president was of course, in a position to address this issue. And so, one way to address issue was to collaborate with the counseling center who is going to organize a, uh, a multiculture conference. And in that conference uh, we invited Dubling Soo(ph) to come in and before he, uh, uh, Dr. Soo(ph) came in, he actually had a, a long, a long conversation with our president and, and giving him some, some hint(ph) of an education about what it takes you know, this is not just bring, uh, you know, bring a consultant coming for, for the weekend but also making some long term commitment and one thing that he said to our president was that, "Diversity and multiculturalism have to go from the top down." Meaning the president has to do something about it. And so they had a lot of conversation and, and I, I think uh, I, I get it that the impression was that the president was a little scared. He was scared, oh, my gosh, I didn't that there was, that kind of involvement that would take from the top down to address a multiculture issues. But he was not in position to back out of it because we are al, already on, on national news about the, the racial tension. And so something has to be done and he did. And so he actually came in and, and open the uh, multiculture conference with this statement, he said, "I had a lot of discussion with Dr. Soo(ph) and one thing I learned is that diversity does not equal multiculturalism." I said, "Yes." At least he learn, he learn something at that is be, because a lot of times people thought that diversity isn't enough. In fact, diversity is not. It's only a statistics. It's important. Di, diversity views the foundation for multiculturalism but that is not sufficient. It keeps, it keeps at the climate and that was safe for us to encourage somebody who was different from us and learn in that process. But what did people actually learn from the process is the, the domain of multiculturalism. Multiculturalism is about uhm, attitude and competence. So a lot of times people would actually create quota and, and felt that if we met some quota we had done with diversity or multiculturalism when it's not, and there are lip service given when the quota is, is met. Uh, in my experience I, I've done uh, some consultation with various organizations and universities and one experience of mine is that people are sometimes are so satisfied with the diversity they thought they are their, when in fact, they are what, what, what some scholars refer to as intellectual masturbation. Feeling good about having the diversity when in fact they don't get it. There are a lot of undercurrent involved. Various subtleties involved. In fact, I feel like we are making a lot of progress in addressing racism but somehow racism is moving more to the overt, blatant racism to the subtle racism which is even harder to address. Because sometimes people don't say things that you don't wanna hear in public. But it doesn't mean that they don't have those attitudes and, and somehow one way to got it, those attitudes would find a ways to come out as in the case of making tenured decisions. So and so, it's not good enough for tenure or somebody who apply for a job, is not good enough to be a, a candidate, they would not survive uh, tenure promotion process. And so, when I was involved in those meetings I would change the people and, and, and discuss what makes this candidate different from another one. We had given tenure to a White candidate who had, who had much fewer obligation than this one would. Why do we have so much concern about this person of color? Bring all these to the surface and so that multiculturalism uhm, we, we didn't take a lot more uh, than having a diverse body as a deception to self and others. Deception to self and others. Sometimes when we brag about things and sometimes I would process with my own department and saying that sometimes I feel so proud on what, what we do that sometimes if I think that our multiculturalism uh, label of the, the philosophy program is very much overrated. We are not necessarily there. So, multiculturalism requires com, commitment and efforts of all. And another thing I, the hot topic I wanna address is the Race-based Versus Inclusive Approach to Multiculturalism. 

00:21:50
Race-based approach Inclusive approach More Pie Initiative Diunital approach (not either/or, but both/and) 

00:21:50
Y. BARRA CHUNG Over the past few decades where we have seen the advances of multiculturalism uh, I remember the days when uh, I was, I was a graduate student, when I was taking multiculture counseling class and the instructor would only focus on race and ethnicity. And when a student challenged that and, and, and wanted to talk about other culture dimensions, uh, the, the instructor was totally resistant to that. And that was a few decades ago. And, and so multiculturalism actually uh, begin with a, a more race-based perspective thinking that what, what do you mean by race-based is, is that uh, race or ethnicity is the most fundamental and profound culture experience at least in America. And so that is the argument about you know, people need to focus on race, and, and so for the race-based approach will be thinking that if people divert you out of culture dimensions, we are losing our focus and not addressing the core issue. And in many sense, this is very relative uh, but of course, the, the other concerns about the perspective is to, leading to the later development of an inclusive approach, when people focus on women's issues such as orientation issues, uh, disability issues, religion issues. And so that is the inclusive approach uh, and, and often times this, there is a constant kinda fight, sometimes very overt, sometimes more subtle between this two approaches and the race-based approach felt like people are resistant to address the racism. Therefore, they are, they are holding, holding on to other things and the inclusive approach feel like the, the race-based approach invalidate their existence and culture experience. And so there's a lot of tension, people are fighting and, and arguing who had more pain, who, who had more discrimination against them and, and that is told to in not very helpful and health, healthy for everybody. Because when we fight with each other, actually who wins? Nobody wins. Uhm, and uh, in fact, a lot of times when we have racial tensions I, I observed in, in, in now uh, national history, I see that sometimes a, uh, the people who are in a privilege position would actually, uh, enjoy having this tensions among the different dimensions of culture diversity and have them fight with each other. And so, when we the Rodney King incident it end up in a riot. Who is fighting whom? It was the one racial minority fighting another racial minority. This is so sad to see that but this is all true when, when people who are oppressed and discriminated against are fighting against each other rather than helping each other. And so uh, in Division 17 we had the more pie initiative. I don't think many have heard of that, more pie initiative. Uh, that means if we fight with each others because we, we're basing on the assumption that we have only one pie and, and anytime somebody come in and, and cut pie and, and we have few pies to, to have. And so the uh, alternative view of that is that we have actually, we can bake more pies. (chuckles) We don't, we, we don't need to have just one pie. If we, we are running out of pies, we bake more pies. And so, this is the initiative that everybody should collaborate. And so this is actually an intersectional kind of uh, collaboration so that the uh, the section on, on racial and ethic minorities and the section on lesbian, gay, bisexual concerns and the section for women, all of these would come together and find a ways that they collaborate, imbued a, a, awareness. And so that is uh, a very uh, good approach. Uh, last year when I went to the uh, the international mo, uh, the International Counseling Psychology Conference in Chicago, I was asked to be a, uhm, a presenter uh, at a symposium addressing how we can use the new APA guidelines on, on Psychotherapy in working with uh, girls and women in educational training. Toward the end of my, my presentation, I was making a, an observation. Look at, who is in the audience and who are in the presenters? I was the only man in that whole uh, presentation. Everybody in the audience was women and so as the case for presenters. I said, "That is why we are not succeeding in more pie initiative." If only women are talking about women issues, we have only one pie. If we need more pies we need to get men involved. We need more pies we need to get them on racial minorities involved. Or if we need more pies, we need to, to get other racial minorities to involved in the concerns about your racial and ethnic, ethnic minority issues. That is when we have more pies. More pies is only, we have an only when we have more resources and that means we need to work with allies. And so one approach to addressing this issue is uh, uh, the Diunital approach uh, because if it's a race-based or, versus in, inclusive, this is an either/ or approach, that the Diunital approach is a both/and. We need to emphasize both Race-based and Inclusive approach which is, which is of course, not easy to do but we gotta think that way. Uh, because if you use either or and, people are fighting and we have only one pie. If we use both/and we have more pies. And, and so what, what's the implication of that in Psychology Education Training then? Be mindful when we are engaging in, in multiculture training, we think out the box(ph), think out of our comfort zone. So if, if the session or the class is about racial minorities, it's easy for a woman or a lesbian gay, bisexual person to think, "Well, I can relate to that to my own experience. Let me talk, share with you my experience." And so when people are so eager to jump to the comfort zone about their own cultural identity, they are missing the point. They are not trying to step out of the comfort zone to understand what is it like to be racial minorities? What are the issues about? So, hold off to that and let yourself be vulnerable and, and listen to the voices even though that may mean sometimes some people feel less(ph) threatened when we talked about White privilege and, and all the discrimination that had happened historically against racial minorities. And it sometimes, when people feel like I, I'd, I'm not a part of that history but I feel like very guilty. And so sometimes, the, the, the White guilt would also prohibit them from moving forward. So, what I'm advocating for is the people step out their comfort zone and understand, emerge yourself and, and that also uh, applies to uh, racial ethnic minorities. When there's a session in training or class about sexual orientation about women, try to leave your comfort zone of, of, of racial minority and understand what it's like to be a sexual minority. Only when that happens that we can have a, the Diunital approach. Uh, when I was uh, look, look, looking at the bookstore, I, I do and I said(ph), uh, there was a, a display of a, a book that I have co-edited with uh, Jim Croteau, uh, uh, a few years back by Sage. And that has to do with uh, Deconstructing heterosexism in the counseling professions. In that book we talked incredibly about the, the Deunital approach and even, even having narratives of people who struggle with being a White man, White uh, gay man and addressing racism. And, and, and journeying of doing so. And also how a, a Black heterosexual woman comes to terms with addressing heterosexism. So if you're interested, I encourage you to read some of the, the narratives of that book. Moving on to Multicultural Education and Training in Psychology- 

00:29:35
Specialized multicultural training Infusion of multicultural perspectives in all training Attitudes and treatment of diversity Faculty, student, and staff recruitment and retention Multicultural atmosphere Microaggression and difficult dialogues 

00:29:35
Y. BARRA CHUNG -I have a few things I wanna mention. The, one, one is that uh, of course, we emphasize that's multicultural training should have some specialized multicultural training, no question about that. There, there should be training on sexual orientation issues or Hispanic Americans or uh, uh, other topics. And when, when it comes to, uh, university of course, offerings. Now that I'm a department chair, I realized that uh, there's a lot more that I need to consider and so one will be the resources available. Do we have faculty members? Even if they have expertise, you know, if they ever to, to teaching know how do I assigned them to teach the courses, and stood by the courses covered. And, and we're also moving to, I, I feel that we're moving to a movement where we are trying to reducing number of years and, and cut(ph) hours for people to graduate simply because we want to be more comparative, we want to ensure financial it is available, that people can finish their education way too early and then move on and build a career. And there are lot a, a, a good intentions uh, for doing it so. But the downside of that is people maybe having less uh, opportunities to take uh, courses that we'll be useful. And, and one advise I always give my students was that uh, take advantage of the chance to have formal education when you're still in school otherwise, when you're out of school, we lie, we lies on, on a job training taking workshops, going to conferences is, is not the same as taking a class like I can never really learn structure education modeling you know, after graduation. It is so hard to emerge yourself that way. I'm, I'm glad I did that when I was a, a graduating student but it took extra credit hours. And our people are willing to do that and our departments are willing to provide the kind of resources. So we have this dilemma providing uh, specialized training and one thought I have is that we, we can demand electives. So people still have some freedom re, regarding what courses they can take but that is a must(ph). You got to take like you know, two courses or three courses of electives to fulfill your requirements and in that regard, people can invest in either they want to uh, take, a, a, a woman study class or a sexual orientation or racial minority and so forth. So that, that could be one approach to do so. Another parts of course is to infuse multiculture aspects in all training as best. And in that regard, I think we have been raising that uh, suggestion a lot but I'm not quite sure we are very successful in doing so. Because often times my students will tell me that uh, "Professor so and so, referred me to you because you're an expert in uh, lesbian, gay studies." And I was like we are still in, in demented(ph) of you know, so and so, is the racial minorities so go to her or to him, or so and so is the woman to go to her. Uh, people are not showing responsibilities and for that matter, I'm not quite sure how successful we are and everybody whatever class they teach would infuse multicultural perspectives to the bringing cases of multi, you know, multicultural cases in their, in their course, in the workshops, studies class and that it remains to be a challenge. Besides having courses we also need to attend to attitudes and treatment of diversity because it's not just taking classes or how you behave in classes, it's also about how you treat students and, and that, that takes a lot of uh, difficult dialogues in, in a, into uh, points, I'm gonna uh, talk about that. We do need to uh, attend to faculty, student and staff uh, recruitment and in retention uh, when, when I was in a Ellis(ph) Institute, I was in the committee to uh, draft strategic plan for the recruitment and retention of uh, annual percent of faculty, student and staff. And one thing I, I realized is that people often times, uh, ignore staff. They only have faculty and students. I think staff is so important. Staff really what makes the love, uh, your life a lot easier or make it hell. They play a major role in, in, in the education institute. They are part of it. And so, if we uh, pay attention to the recruitment of, of staff, uh, diverse and also multicultural incompetent that will make a lot of difference. Like one issue that we have to face was that the staff wanted to have Christmas treats in a department. So that is the cultural issue. And so that became a very difficult dialogue. Uh, some people's feeling got hurt when we've had to address this issue and then the power struggle in the faculty versus staff, and student uh, is, is a very uh, uh, delicate kind of process. So if ra, no staff, we are, we are not really truly attending to the endless fear of a training institute. Periodically uh, and anyway(ph) I only have five minutes left, uh, so I have to skip some, some of this. We gotta attend to a multiculture atmosphere constantly talking about this issues in, in a, in a faculty meeting or staff training meeting uh, bringing this history in the forefront. I think sometimes we are afraid of speaking up especially if you're in a low rank uh, or if a student, if you're, it's only faculty or staff members. Uhm, once again I wanna bring up those history said. It has to come from the top up. The top has to uh, viewed the struct, the infrastructure for it to happen model the behavior and encourage and invited everybody's participation. Of course, addressing microaggression is very important and di, difficult dialogue and uh, Walter Worthington(ph) did a, a great job in uh, doing workshop on uh, doing difficult dialogue at the National Multiculture Conference and Summit. So if you're interested in, in engaging in descant dialogue, I encourage you to contact him at the University of Missouri at Columbia. Uh, in an inch of time I wanted just flash views some of the multicultural, multicultural guidelines that have been available by APA like in 20, in 2000 we have the Guidelines for Psychotherapy with Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Clients. Uhm 2002, we have the Multicultural Education, Training, Research, Practice, and Organization Change for Psychologists which is a work with many, many years of hard work by many, many people and I really encourage you if you have not had chance to see it, go, uh, go to the American Psychologist and take out the article. Also we have a new Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Older Adults, uhm that's very encouraging. We're branching out to more and more, more cultural dimensions. And uh, the most recent one, I just mention earlier is the Psychological Practice with Girls and Women back in 2007. Now, all of these years, I'm, I put on the uh, powerpoint are the years that they are approved by APA, not necessarily to years they are published. And so some of them actually have the same year as approved, some of them will be one year later uh, then approved. Uh, something I wanna brief, briefly mention is the Internationalization of uh, Psychological Education Training which is going to become part of multicultural movement.

Y. BARRA CHUNG Uh, in the past few years I have, I have had the opportunity to go to uh, some Asian countries uh, to do consultation and training and in that process we are also talking a lot of business like uh, for example I was in (inaudible ) National Career Development Association as president and we had the curriculum and the other countries would wanted to adapt the curriculum and translate and localized it so part that was a business trip. Now, in, in having this business trips, one, one thing I observe was that some of the organizations nationally credentialing organizations in America are reaching out to many countries and some of that are, are taking the profit-driven approach. And some are actually going out of the expertise and try to accredit things that they don't have any business of accrediting and it's a very sad story. The other one is the i, Imperialism approach that people are pretending America is the standard against for comparison and everybody has to adopt and get credentials. And the sad thing is that a lot of countries are buying into that. They think America has it and they wanted to be credentialed by the uh, American and of course, people would name it international kind of credentials and standards. And, and it's a di, very difficult time when I went to this countries and talk to them about this opportunities and all they want is to get the American uh, kind of credentials. And as, one time I said to one person uh, from, from China I said, "As a Chinese to Chinese I'm gonna tell you this. One day you would need to have your own localized policies credentialing. You don't want to rely on another country." Uh, and of course, they were not ready to hear that, and uh, same as to when I was same, the same thing to the board of directors of an organization, they were not ready to hear that until they, some of them went to uh, International Policy Making of Career Developments in Australia and then, we have people from India and Africa standing up and saying that "We are so fed up with American uh, imposing the standards on us, that has to stop." And then they came back and told me that, that story and said, "Isn't that what I told you like three years ago?" (laughs) Uh, so people are not getting it, in America they're not getting it, internationally they're not getting it. We got to promote the sense of awareness. We cannot allow people to be abused that way because of financial reasons or the uh, imperialism reasons. So APA Task Force has uh, APA has formed a task force on a APA's growing international quality assurance and that emphasizes APA as a learning partner and I like it very much. We do have a lot to offer. We can be a consultant, we can provide training but we cannot pretend that we are the standard. And everybody has to do what we are doing here. Uh, and so we are learning as a partner. What we wanna do is to help each other out as a partner to move forward all together. We cannot ignore the international problem(ph) because in a rapid pace of globalization, multiculturalism demands cross-cultural skills in international relations. I think my time is just about so, so I wanna say some, give conclusion. Multiculturalism requires everybody's commitment and efforts. Do not allow your salient identity to get in your way of understanding and affirming other cultural experiences. Multiculturalism benefits all people not just minorities. Thank you very much and this is e-mail address if you wanna contact me.
