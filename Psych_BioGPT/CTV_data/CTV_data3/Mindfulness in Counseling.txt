DIANE GEHARD So, mindfulness is a rapidly growing, uh, therapy model. Um, and it's based on mindfulness practice, which is a meditation practice primarily. And in its most simple, basic, um, concepts, mindfulness is about a quality of attention. And specifically it's about paying attention to what's happening in the present moment with, without judgement, and I would like to add to that, uh, with compassion, actually. And so the most common form of mindfulness is breath meditation, where a person focuses on their breath and tries to quiet all of the thoughts in their mind, um, and, and keeps their focus on their breath without thinking. Which sounds pretty easy, but usually within two to five seconds the mind wanders off. And so the real practice of mindfulness is this focusing, re --, uh, losing focus, focusing, losing focus, focusing, losing focus. So most of the current mindfulness programs are based on the work of John Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts. And, approximately 30 years ago, he started a mindfulness-based stress reduction program in the behavioral medicine program at the university hospital. And he had doctors send their patients to him who had heart conditions, or chronic pain, and stress was considered part of the problem. And, in the these classes, he -- they were eight week classes and he would teach people how to use mindfulness. And they taught many different forms of mindfulness. They taught the most classic, breath meditation. They also taught a mindful body scan, in which they, you kind of put your attention on different parts of the body, and unlike traditional relaxation body scans where you try to relax, in mindfulness body scan, you just notice what's going on in each part of the body. There was some basic yoga poses, they did a, uh, daily activities, using mindfulness, like washing dishes and walking, those sorts of things. And so, and with these, um, eight week mindfulness-based stress reduction, they were seeing significant progress in, um, patients who had chronic pain. And, and they kept exploring possibilities and they, um, used it with depression and anxiety and they were finding encouraging results. And, because of this, um, there's been increased interest and many different mindfulness-based group programs have been developed. There's, uh, a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy that, um, targets people who've been depressed and, and reducing depression relapse, so that they stay un-depressed once they leave therapy. Um, there's mindfulness-based programs for eating disorders, substance abuse, couple enrichment, not, for non-distressed couples. Um, for parenting. So there are numerous, um, mindfulness-based programs and it's addressing just a wide variety of, uh, clinical issues that are commonly seen in therapy. Uh, however, at the time, at, at this time, most of the programs are in a group format. And yet, many people, in private practice or in an agency setting have clients coming in either as individuals, couples, or families, and they're curious about how, to, about learning mindfulness, and how it might be useful to them. And so, um, more and more therapists in their little offices are trying to do something similar to what happens in those big group formats. The difference really is that in, when you're working one-on-one with an individual client, couple, or family, that you don't have that group dynamic. And there's something about mindfulness practice. It's, it's very, um, solitary activity, it's probably one of the most solitary activities that someone in modern, you know, America, might experience. And, and so it also feels like you're not doing a whole lot. And so it's very hard to stay motivated with it without having that group, uh, experience and knowing that there are lots of other people everywhere else, who are meditating, your classmates are all meditating, being able to come back and talk about your experiences, and share those experiences. It seems that, uh, many people find that really useful in developing a practice. And so it's, when you start trying to, uh, work with someone on a one-on-one basis, you need to use some different approaches to motivate and to structure their practice so that they're able to keep up with it. And so then for that reason, I have found often teaching couples or families to meditate together is actually easier than teaching an individual person who's gonna practice all by them lone--, their lonesome selves, um, to stick with their practice. Cuz often times having, um, the family or the couple and everyone kind of knows, if it's not an issue that becomes tense, where there's tension around it, um, most people find it, uh, it's actually much easier to practice with your family or as a couple. And specifically with families, um, there's increasing interest in mindfulness in terms of working with ADHD, both for with adults and children and there is some research and some theories suggesting that mindfulness might actually have a, a therapeutic effect, in the sense of helping kind of correct some of the brain, uh, structure in, with kids who have ADHD. And so I've had a lot of families coming to me, wanting to learn how to do mindfulness with their kids instead of using medication. And so they are often really good at practicing regularly, uh, because they're hoping to avoid having to put their kids on medication, so. That often, that type of motivation is what you need to get someone to do it often without that group experience. Cuz the group experience makes it easier to practice. There's some basic principles to keep in mind when you're trying to, uh, teach clients mindfulness in one-on-one sessions. And the most important thing is actually motivating them and coming up with a plan. Because actual just teaching them the basic technique, that's pretty simple, that's gonna happen, that's not too hard. But what's the real challenge is getting them to do it outside of session. And so most the time, in session, you'll see in my session with Alejandra, most of the time I spend talking about moti--, you know, motivating her. And I do this by talking about the, you know, how it affects the stress response. I talk about how it helps her develop this observation stance and, you know, and in our case, she's read an article about how this helps with depression, so she's curious and she wants to learn, and so I talk about that. I talk about the depression relapse and what that means, and how mindfulness might be helpful and specifically why it might be helpful. I bring in, um, some of the newer research that suggests that, that the brain structures actually shift a little bit with regular practice, to encourage her, um, in terms of, wow, this could make a real difference. And so spending time doing that. And with each client, of course, you have to figure out what will motivate them the same, what, what motivates one client to practice isn't the same as what motivates another. Um, so identifying what might be the real things that might motivate. And then, and again, it's real important to not, if someone's not motivated to do mindfulness, they're not going to, and so you don't wanna push this on anyone and, and so it's very important to be careful about trying to get your -- sometimes I think therapists get a little exuberant about mindfulness and they want everyone to do it, cuz the research shows it works with so many different problems, and, and that is not a very respectful way to work with clients. And, it is something that someone has to have a lot of internal motivation to do and intrinsic motivation because it's, for it to have a lot of the effects that we would hope for it to have, it has to be kind of part of a lifestyle that they choose. So, so motivating them, teaching them the basic technique. And I recommend, um, doing just a, you know, minute or two in session with them to let them experience it and ask questions and then afterwards, I work on putting together a very concrete plan. And my basic strategy is always, you know, Monday through Fridays, if you've got a standard work schedule. And find, you know, something you do on all those days and attach mindfulness to whatever that activity is. You know, it could be getting, you know, the morning, you know, shower routine, or the breakfast routine, or lunch routine, or bedtime routine -- if they're not too tired at night because sometimes that becomes an issue. But, um, but attaching it to something, and then trying to, um, identify what are the barriers gonna be, and trying to predict those, and do a little problem solving before they leave the office. Um, I also like to give them a handout, and, um, I even use a little log where they can check off and feel like they're making progress, um, cuz that also seems to help motivate people. Cuz the real issue when working on one-on-one session is trying to, um, create the motivations that they have regular practice to see the benefits that they're they're actually hoping from. And that's why, in many ways, it's easier to work with couples and families. Because, you know, like I, they, um, they're two people or they're more people, and so if everyone's invested in it, it becomes much easier to practice and to be regular, and hopefully one person will encourage the other one when they're not feeling like it on a particular day. When I'm working with clients, I keep some, uh, ideas of what are some of the indications that this person might be ready. And there are some certain counter-indications for, um, mindfulness. So some of the indications of someone who might be ready for this is, like the client, you'll see in the video, she read, uh, an article in a magazine and was curious and started, brought the whole subject up. So obviously someone like that's ready to learn mindfulness. Um, other indications are, they're asking, you know, what can I do to help with this? You know, I have a lot of clients who say, "You know, I just I know I'm, I'm, you know, going over and over in my head with all this, and I, is there something I can to help me with this?" So, when they're asking for a specific things to do, that's a, a good sign. Often, uh, people who have a spiritual practice. Um, they pray regularly, or they go to church regularly. They can find that mindfulness fits really nicely with a lot of ongoing spiritual practices so people who already have that, uh, spiritual interest, this can be a really good fit for them. Now in terms of counter-indications, I don't introduce mindfulness � well, first of all, to anyone who doesn't seem interested when I first introduce the idea, cuz it's, it's not one of those things that people are just gonna casually pick up because their therapist kind of is pushing them on the issues. So, there, there needs to be a genuine, uh, sense of interest. Um, but if their lives are very chaotic at the moment. Like they're going through, you know, a major divorce and their schedules are all off, and you know, or they're very exhausted, or they feel overwhelmed, like just don't put one more thing on my plate, you know. And yes, mindfulness would be great for stress, but starting mindfulness practice when one is under a lot of stress often is not a good idea. And if they start and they, you know, during a very stressful period, and they can't get regular practice in, they often just give up all together and say, "Oh, it'll, it'll never work for me." So trying to time it at a time in their life where it works. Now it also really helps if someone feels like they want to do something to address the problem, like if they still feel like it's someone else's problem, or it's the situation and that there isn't this genuine interest to try to change themselves in some way, it's also probably not a good fit. Another important thing to keep in mind is that if there's a history of psychosis, or current psychosis, if there's a history of trauma and especially if there're current flashbacks, or other intrusive memories, um, that and there, that you need to proceed very cautiously. There are some, there's some new emerging research in using, um, mindfulness with post-traumatic stress. Especially with, uh, when there has been a trauma history, you generally don't want them to close their eyes. Most people are more likely to get flashbacks if their eyes are closed. So you wanna proceed very carefully with, um, psychosis, or manic, um, behaviors, or, if there's a history of trauma that's that's real active, where there are a lot of intrusive memories currently. When I, when I work with clients, I encourage that they work in small increments and begin in small increments of just two to five minutes, um, per session because for most people, that's the most doable. It doesn't feel overwhelming, and they're more willing to engage in it. And even when I'm working with someone who's a fairly experienced meditator, who's, you know, has, is now used to working for 10 to 20 minutes, you know, for meditation, that's comfortable for them, then there becomes the idea, oh, I don't have my 20 minutes, I, I can't meditate, I don't have, I don't have enough time. And, um, maybe it's because of my own busy life, but I have found that mini-meds, is what I like to call 'em, mini, mini-meditations, can be extremely helpful and really change a person's relationship to whatever's going on in their life. I mean, the most obvious benefit of a mini-meditation is for most of us, even just 60 seconds, or two minutes of meditation, um, that it, it evokes the relaxation response and we get clearer, we feel more centered. And, it just kind of, can really change just how your mind is, uh, functioning in that moment. More importantly, what I have found with mini-meditations is that just sitting down, and even for 60 seconds, even when things, when things are starting to get a little bit hectic, or chaotic, or stressful, to just stop for 60 to, 60 seconds to two minutes. That just, even that little tiny break, it, it interrupts the problem cycle. And we know in systemic therapies, they're all about interrupting the cycle. And so if you can just sit down and even just try to meditate. Even if you don't even focus on much for very long, you've interrupted your cycle. And so you've actually done a sys-- systemic strategic intervention by just introducing this pause. And for many people, that pause allows them to then choose a better response. And, uh, it does, may not fix everything, and make everything perfect, but often things end up much better with just that small little pause. The other thing that people have told me and I've experienced it some myself, I have to admit, is that by taking that one to two minutes or five minutes to meditate, um, especially in the middle of a stressful situation, as your mind begins to quiet, you kind of reconnect with what, you know, narrative and postmodern therapists call the preferred identity. Or, preferred self. And so by just taking those couple moments of quiet time, you get more in touch with the person you want to be, and how you want to respond in this situation or this relationship. And so these just small little breaks, they don't have to be anything 20, 30-minute, 45-minute meditation sessions, even just one or two minutes can dramatically change the outcome in, especially if there's a stressful situation going on. And so I, I recommend to the clients, and talk about how they can use this to deal with the challenges that they're coming with. If they're having difficult relationships at work, or at home, or with their children. Oh, with children, oh my goodness, with parenting, I think teaching parents to just take one to two minutes of breathing and mindfulness before they respond to their children. I think they're gonna like the responses much more. And so parents often find that very, very useful. And even for parenting, even a 10-second pause, is sometimes all they need to just dramatically change how they respond to their child. Now, for the brief moments to really have an effect, it really does help if they're doing five or 10 minutes daily, which means that when you are in a more challenging, stressful situation, you can tap into that state of mind much more readily if you've been practicing it during the good times, so. But it can be amazing how using this can just, you know, kind of, either change the, the, just interrupt the cycle, or allow people to choose just a different behavior.

Mindfulness in Session 

00:16:30
DIANE GEHARD Next you're gonna see me working with Alejandra who is a client who read an Oprah magazine about mindfulness. And she got excited about it and came in and talked to me one day. And she kinda, you know, mentioned it offhandedly halfway through one of our sessions. And so, I typically, when someone inquires, I, I try to get a sense as to whether or not they're ready. And I, I usually wait to have one session where we can spend at least the bulk of the session, from the beginning. Cuz I don't want to introduce it and run out of time and, and have them go home with only half the instructions. You're not really fully prepared in terms of both being motivated to do it, having the right instructions and also having a very detailed plan to -- so that they're most likely to succeed. And so you'll see in this session, I'll work with Alejandra, and I'll start by, you know, checking in to make sure she still really wants to do this and spend today and her good money, you know, on doing this. And then I, I talk about motivating her, kind of trying to educate her, and I try to pick other things I think will be useful to her in becoming motivated to practice. And then I go over in detail what to do. And then at the end, we work on a plan that's gonna be very, very specific to her life. That, and we're gonna try to problem solve and identify the, all the barriers that are, get in her way to make sure it's a plan that's gonna work for her in the next upcoming week. Hi, Alejandra. 

00:17:50
ALEJANDRA Hi, Diane. 

00:17:50
DIANE GEHARD How've you been this week? 

00:17:50
ALEJANDRA I've been doing good. Way much better. 

00:17:55
DIANE GEHARD Good, good. 

00:17:55
ALEJANDRA Way much better. 

00:17:55
DIANE GEHARD That's good to hear. 

00:17:55
ALEJANDRA Getting � normal. 

00:18:00
DIANE GEHARD Good. Well, you know where we left off last week, you had specifically asked to learn some more about mindfulness, and I suggested we waited till we have a whole session to deal with that. And is today a good day for that? 

00:18:10
ALEJANDRA I think so, yeah. I've been very interested on that topic for some time. 

00:18:10
DIANE GEHARD Okay. Yeah, yeah, you read about it in a magazine? 

00:18:15
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

00:18:15
DIANE GEHARD And I think they specifically talked about depression in the magazine. 

00:18:20
ALEJANDRA Something about relapse. 

00:18:20
DIANE GEHARD Yeah. 

00:18:20
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

00:18:20
DIANE GEHARD Yes. 

00:18:20
ALEJANDRA That I'm a bit concerned about. 

00:18:25
DIANE GEHARD Yes. And so, it may sound strange to use the word relapse with depression, but, um, what they mean by that is that, let's say, you know, you come in, you know, to work on depression with me and things have gotten better and you're, you're gonna say goodbye to me and fire me one day, and go on with your life, and, you know, get off medication if you've been on it type of thing. And, and then within a year, though, about 50% of the people who've either been on medication or had, and/or had psychotherapy, relapse, meaning that they become clinically depressed within a year. So, 50% of people relapsing with depression is � 

00:19:00
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

00:19:00
DIANE GEHARD It's, that's not good odds. And, it's not like, you know. So there's a lot of concern, even with professionals obviously, about how do we improve this? How do we have people come in, get treated for depression and, um, stay un-depressed, and stay happy longer so that they don't have to keep coming back. 

00:19:15
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm. 

00:19:15
DIANE GEHARD So one of the real exciting, um, approaches for dealing with this is, is mindfulness. And so they've been using, teaching mindfulness, which is a type of meditation. And I'm gonna, later in the session if you still want to, we will go through and we'll learn how to do it. And we'll practice today. 

00:19:30
ALEJANDRA Oh, okay. Mm-hmm. 

00:19:30
DIANE GEHARD Um, but it's this type of meditation that you would do on a regular basis. And they have found that it significantly reduces the, uh, relapse rate for depression. And so it's real promising research. And so there's been quite a lot of excitement and know, you know, magazine articles and news shows, so I know you've probably heard about it in several places. 

00:19:50
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

00:19:50
DIANE GEHARD So do you wanna hear a little bit more about why they think mindful works or what it might be doing? 

00:19:55
ALEJANDRA Yeah, yeah. 

00:19:55
DIANE GEHARD Okay. So, so one of the main mechanisms, um, of change that they believe is happening with mindfulness is that we all have something called a stress response. You may have heard of it. Sometimes it's referred to as a fight-flight-freeze mechanism, or fight-flight? Uh ... 

00:20:10
ALEJANDRA Yeah. I've heard about that. 

00:20:10
DIANE GEHARD Yeah, yeah. And basically all that is is when, you know, we perceive a threat, whether it's physical or psychological. Some kind of, something's wrong in the environment, um, that the body kicks off this stress response. And what they have found is that with mind, regular mindfulness practice, that people are able to shut that stress response off more quickly. And so you're literally able to better manage your stress. And they actually believe now that the physical structures in the brain change enough, or change slightly, the brain kinda rewires differently, so that you actually have more conscious control over your stress response. So that, you know, if you're, um, let's just say driving on the freeway, someone cuts you off, most of us kinda get this ahh, you know, little stress response. And with regular mindfulness practice, I think one of the first things you'll find is that you're able to just calm yourself right down after that and it, you don't stay agitated. And, you know, the more you practice, you know, the bigger issues, you know, like the issues you've been having with your boss at work, you know. You will likely find that the more you practice, the easier it is for you to just, you know, have a response, but also, calm yourself down. And then, be able to kind of choose your response rather than just get all worked up and have it kinda, you know, like you say, it typically lingers for hours, you know, or all the way home, and you know, you go home with it and stuff like that. So that's one of the real exciting promises of, of mindfulness, is what they think is happening is that with regular practice you will literally rewire your brain so that it's easier for you to manage stress. And so-- 

00:21:45
ALEJANDRA It becomes like, automatic. 

00:21:50
DIANE GEHARD Yeah, automatic. It becomes easier, how about that. 

00:21:50
ALEJANDRA Easier. Okay. Easier. 

00:21:50
DIANE GEHARD Yeah, I think it still takes effort. Okay? I'll tell you that. Not quite automatic. Sometimes, some minor, I think the minor things are gonna feel more automatic. With your boss, it'll always require some effort to not, you know, um, you know, have that type of stuff get to you. And the stuff with our partners and our families, all of that will take some effort. But, they're actually believing that the mindfulness practice actually rewires the brain so that it is just easier to do. And so that's one of the real exciting things, um, about mindfulness. The other thing that I think really relates to depression, depression relapse, is that through the practice of mindfulness, you develop this ability to observe your mind in action. So watching your thoughts and feelings come and go through your head. And so this observe --, this ability to observe your mind allows you to kind of step out of that whole stream of, of thought and reflect on it. And to have thoughts about your thoughts. And this kind of second order of ability to reflect on what's going on in your mind. And actually even choose whether or not you wanna believe some of your thoughts, or whether you think some of your own feelings are even reasonable, you know. And so this ability to step back and watch your mind in action is what I believe helps a lot of people who've been dealing with depression and anxiety. Because a lot of what depression is is your mind starts, you know, noticing all the negatives and thinking a lot about it and building 'em up. And what happens is, you know, after you're done seeing me, and you're living beautiful, great life, right? Um, there will be new stressors that come down the road, and new problems will crop up. And with the practice of mindfulness, you're gonna be more likely to notice early on, when your mind is kinda going back to that depressive thinking. And worrying about things, or, you know, knowing that your boss is getting under your skin. And you're just gonna notice it earlier and because you have that observer perspective, you're gonna be able to say "Hey, is that reasonable, is this fair, do I need to do something? Or, do I need to go call Diane, again?" You know, "Do I need to go take a vacation?" You know, whatever it is. Um, but it'll, you'll be better able to notice your own thoughts and feelings and I really think this is a lot of the reasons, one of the main reasons why dep -- mindfulness is so helpful for people to keep from relapsing with depression. 

00:24:05
ALEJANDRA Hm. That makes sense. Makes sense. 

00:24:10
DIANE GEHARD Yeah, yeah. So it's pretty, it's pretty exciting. So, so yes, so those are some of the main reasons why I think it could really be useful to you, um, in your journey in terms of, you know, finishing up here and moving on and being able to kind of be your own therapist, you know, once you leave here. So, I, uh, so I wanted to tell you -- so, maybe I should explain to you kind of what mindfulness is. Um, mindfulness has a few basic qualities. The first is that it's a present moment awareness. So it means that you're, you're very aware of what's going on at this specific point of focus, which for us, today, is gonna be your breath, in the present moment. So you'll be watching your breath in the present moment. The, the other component that's very important is with, um, without judgment. And I would even add, with compassion. And what that's gonna mean, and, um, is that, you know, as you're noticing what is in the present moment, you're doing it without judging it to be good or bad. You're just noticing what goes, is going on. Those are the two kind of key elements of mindfulness. And you can actually, there, there are just, I don't, I don't know if they're millions, but there are probably hundreds of ways to be mindful, and things to focus on. The most common one is the breath. There's also eating meditation and walking and daily activities. One of my favorites is mindful dishwashing. 

00:25:35
ALEJANDRA Really? 

00:25:35
DIANE GEHARD Cuz I hate to wash dishes, but you know, when you do it mindfully, at least it counts as your meditation time too. 

00:25:40
ALEJANDRA Okay. 

00:25:45
DIANE GEHARD So, there are lots of different ways to do mindfulness. Most, a lot of the, when we think of mind, mindfulness meditation most was think of Buddhism, cuz the Buddhists have a very evolved and very, you know, uh, meditation tradition. But, um, the Christian traditions also have a very, uh, long history with actually almost very similar practices to mindfulness. Um, very parallel, even to the teachings in Buddhism, which is really, really interesting. So, I notice you have a cross, is, would you -- 

00:26:10
ALEJANDRA I, I'm Catholic. Yeah. 

00:26:10
DIANE GEHARD Okay. Yeah. And the Catholics in particular, they're the, um, tradition that has developed, um, it's called contemplative prayer. And the Catholic tradition and St. John with the cross, and St. Theresa are the two Catholics most closely kind of started the contemplative approach. And it really has had a renaissance, especially in the last half of the 20th century as all this mindfulness research is coming out. And the, I would said the one difference maybe between, um, mindfulness, the Buddhist version and the Christian version, that in the Christian version, and St. John has beautiful writings on this, he talks about how as you quiet your mind, you have direct contact with God. And that when, as the mind gets quiet and still and, and you stop having all those words and thoughts going through your mind that you can have direct contact with God. And so on the handout I'll give you today, and I'm not gonna give it to you now. 

00:27:05
ALEJANDRA Okay. 

00:27:05
DIANE GEHARD Cuz I don't want you to read it while we're sitting here. 

00:27:10
ALEJANDRA I felt like taking notes. 

00:27:10
DIANE GEHARD Don't worry, don't worry. 

00:27:10
ALEJANDRA Okay. 

00:27:10
DIANE GEHARD It's all there. 

00:27:10
ALEJANDRA Okay. 

00:27:10
DIANE GEHARD It's all on the website. Uh, and I'm gonna give you your handout. Um, but the contemp -- you might be real interested in reading up on contemperative, contemplative prayer. And your church may even have a, a group, um, that does it, cuz there are groups that have some, they'll call in contemplative practices, or contemplative prayer. Um, and so you may al --, that may also, be helpful to you and kind of, um, I don't know if you pray regularly, but, you know, adding the mindfulness to your prayer time might be a real, um, meaningful kind of effective way for you to have this kinda make sense and fit into something that already exists in your life, which is a really ideal. 

00:27:40
ALEJANDRA That's right. 

00:27:40
DIANE GEHARD So the Christians have pretty much the exact same practice. Um, and, and they just add the piece of connecting with God when the, the Buddhists don't have that piece. So yeah, so that's, so that's all it is is present moment awareness. So you'll find the most common practice is to focus on the breath. And, um, there's some interesting research by Dan Siegel at UCLA here, and he has, he has suggested that the, one of the benefits for this, besides the fact that wherever you go you're breathing, so you don't need to have soap, you know. Or there's also cookie meditation, I, we can teach you cookie meditation one day. 

00:28:20
ALEJANDRA Wow. 

00:28:20
DIANE GEHARD Um, but the breath is r --, has this in and out, in and out, and it's very rhythmic and it's very predictable. And our brains love to be able to predict what's gonna happen next. And when the brain knows that it's doing a really good job of what's, it, what's coming up next, it gets into a more synchronous, uh, brain state and so it, kinda gets into an optimal state of functioning, actually. And so it's one of the reasons you can, like I said, you can do walking meditation, dishwashing mindfulness, um, cookie-eating, you know, eating a cookie, eating an orange, you know, peeling an orange. All, you know, body scan, there are lots of different types of meditation. But the breath meditation in particular seems to have, um, the extra added benefit of your mind is watching something and focusing on something that is rhythmic, and very predictable, which helps get it into a synchronous brain state. So it's one of the benefits of focusing on the breath. 

00:29:20
ALEJANDRA That's so interesting. 

00:29:25
DIANE GEHARD Yeah, yeah, it is, it is. So what are you gonna do here? So what are we gonna do. So, uh, in a few minutes, we're gonna sit down and we're gonna practice meditating, and the instructions are super simple. And mastering it will take a lifetime. I always joke it's a lot like parenting. It's like, in some ways, the basic instructions aren't that hard, the basic principles, but, implementing on a daily basis, you know, it'll take a lifetime and you'll never be perfect. And Mindfulness is the same way. The instructions are simple, um, but doing it, it's not something you're going to be perfect at or gonna get 100% right, you know, we're not gonna sit here. We're only gonna meditate for 60 seconds, for a minute, and, um, and during that time, you're not gonna even get it perfect, even, the 60 seconds. What we're gonna do is we're gonna have you sit comfortably and the basic instructions are to observe yourself breathing , while quieting your mind. Mmkay. Does that make sense? 

00:30:15
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm. 

00:30:15
DIANE GEHARD Yeah, you're gonna just. Well, and you know, most people, a lot of people like to feel their bellies kind of rise and fall. Some people like to feel the cool air going in and out of their nose, and, or you can kind of even just feel the air move in and, in and out through your body. But just focus on breathing, while quieting your mind of all thoughts, essentially. 

00:30:35
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm. Mm-hemm. 

00:30:35
DIANE GEHARD That make sense? 

00:30:35
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

00:30:40
DIANE GEHARD Um. And so that's, those are the basic instructions. It doesn't sound so bad, right? Right? Why does it take a lifetime to perfect this? Um, the thing is is that within a few seconds your mind is going to wander off and start thinking. And, and, or you might have emotions come up. It's also possible you might have physical sensations, like you might feel an itch, or a pain. Or there might be a loud noise outside, you know. There are all sorts of distractions that can come from within your mind, from your body, from the outside. So, but I guarantee you, within two to three, maybe you're good, you're gonna get five seconds, okay? 

00:31:15
ALEJANDRA Okay. 

00:31:15
DIANE GEHARD But within a few seconds, your mind is gonna start producing language, and it's gonna start talking at you. You know, "Am I doing this right? Oh my God, okay, I gotta go and pick up, you know, so-and-so, and I gotta go to the grocery store, what about dinner, and oh my God, I cannot believe what my mom told me last time I talked to her on the phone." Oh, and then you're gonna remember something that happened in the third grade, you know, and then you're gonna go back to your to-do list, and then you're gonna think about what you're doing Saturday night, you know, and then you're gonna -- at some point, in the middle of this stream, of what they often call monkey-mind, an you can be in to-do lists and conversations in the past, and yesterday and the future, you're gonna, you know, it can be all over the place. I've found that I'm always a little surprised what, where my mind goes, and how it links things up. But at some point in all of that, you're gonna go, "What am I supposed to be doing now?" And, you're like, "Oh yeah, I'm supposed to be meditating. That's right." And this is a real critical point. And it's, it's very important at this point you don't feel, don't beat yourself up. And that you don't feel like you've made a mistake, or that you don't feel like you're doing it wrong. Um, it's very important when you catch your mind wandering that you respond with compassion. And understanding. Cuz that's actually where the self-compassion gets built up. And because one of the, one of the research also shows that through mindfulness meditation, um, is correlated with developing greater self-compassion. And I think that comes from that moment when you catch yourself, your mind has wandered. And it does seem like the natural tendency is to just beat yourself up, you know. It's like, "Oh my god, I can't believe I can't even focus for five seconds," you know, "What's wrong with me." It seems to be where most of us wanna go. Um, and so instead of doing that, it's very important that you have compassion and understanding that this is how your mind works. And this is the practice of mindfulness. It is a practice of focus, losing focus, focus, losing focus, focus, losing focus. And that's, and you could do that 20 times in 60 seconds, you know. And certainly as you stretch, and sometimes you lose more focus, you know, lose focus for a long time and sometimes there's more loss of focus than focus, that happens too. Um, but it's very important that you, at that moment, you know, and there many ways you can then refocus. Some people, um, like to envision a bubble. Uh, like a soap bubble, or a cloud, you know so the bubble can burst, you know the cloud can kinda float away, and you just let those thoughts float away, or the soap bubble, those thoughts kinda pop in a, a thought bubble. You can, um, label the thoughts as, you know, planning, or worrying, if they had a particular theme, and say, "Yes, that's what there, and I can, I can go back and do that later and just let it go." Um, so you can also just say, "Ah, yes, that too," and just kind of acknowledge it, "Yep, that's something I think about, and that's where my mind went. Okay, yes, that too." And then gently refocus yourself, um, on your, on your breath. And the one other thing I like to add here is that I think especially when you're doing, practicing mindfulness for psychological benefits, which is, kind of what you're saying at the moment. I don't know what your primary motivation is, but if you're, um, when you're doing it to develop, um, that observer perspective we saw, that, that ability to � I mean, the losing the focus and the re-focusing, and that re-focusing is actually where you would be rewiring your brain. Remember, I talked about how your brain kinda gets, the physical structure of the brain changes with regular mindfulness practice? And it's because every time you refocus, there's a new neuro-firing going, and the more you, your neurons fire together, they wire together, and so you actually, actually thicken the connection there. And what the real serious, um, might, uh, meditation practitioners, like a Buddhist monk, they actually have thicker prefrontal cortexes than the rest of us. Because they use their brains differently, and how you use your brain shapes its structure. 

00:35:20
ALEJANDRA Wow. 

00:35:20
DIANE GEHARD Yeah, so it's -- 

00:35:20
ALEJANDRA This is not like relaxation thing. It seems like I need to put on more effort. 

00:35:25
DIANE GEHARD Yes, you're catching on. Yes, this is true. Cuz it's not a relaxation training. You know, like you can sometimes put on relaxation tapes, and they're like ahh, you know, you feel so blissful imagining you're, you know, on a tropical island and the sea is � It's not that type of thing, it does take effort, and it, like I said, there are times where it's a little frustrating, you can get frustrated with yourself, cuz you're like god, you know, I focused, you know, most this week, and then today, I can't focus at all, and so you can have a lot of difficult emotions come up. And so it's not a relaxation exercise in the classic sense, it's, it's a focusing, it's focusing your attention. It's, it's an exercise of attention is another way to think about it. 

00:36:05
ALEJANDRA Hm. 

00:36:05
DIANE GEHARD Cuz you're focusing your attention in the present moment and when it wanders off, you're bringing it back. And so, yes, it requires effort, and in fact, the recommendation is so sit up, with good posture which, I think, even requires more effort. But, um, we'll talk about that, um, when we get to that, exactly how to do it. So, so where were we. So we have you focusing, you've lost focus, and then you're returning your focus with compassion by imagining something like a cloud floating away, labeling it as a thought, or worry or planning. Um, or just even acknowledging, yes, that too, and bringing your attention back without feeling like you failed or done something bad. And that's what the practice is. It's a focus and a, a, it's a focusing, loss of focus, and return to focus. Is that making sense to you? 

00:37:00
ALEJANDRA Yeah, a lot. 

00:37:00
DIANE GEHARD Okay. Well, good, so, so some of the practicalities about doing it. One is the general recommendation is to, to sit upright, if you can with your back against the chair, to have, with erect posture, but not like, not like military, you know, oh my God, but to be as comfortably erect as possible. 

00:37:15
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm. 

00:37:20
DIANE GEHARD We can sit back and be comfortable now. So, um, so that's one thing. Um, keeping your eyes open or closed. Um, most people -- you can do it either way. Uh, most people seem to prefer closing their eyes cuz they can seem to focus better inward, uh, that way. Um, if you, if you want, you can also keep a soft gaze on the floor, generally, two, three feet ahead of you, just a soft gaze, you know. Um, and try not to stare at something. But, it's really just a matter of preference, um, whether you want your eyes open or closed . And I really recommend starting with short practice sessions. Like, even two to five minutes. Um, because, sometimes starting off, much of the research I'll let you know is done with longer sessions, like 15 to 20 minutes, or even longer. 

00:38:00
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm. 

00:38:05
DIANE GEHARD Um, but the short sessions, I can tell you that most of my, uh, clients, find that even just five minutes makes a significant change in their day. And so, but I, but it's easier to fit that five-minute time in, and what we're gonna, what you're gonna find is that the hardest part about the whole thing is fitting it in to your schedule. That really is the greatest challenge. So, I really recommend keeping it short, like two to five minutes. The other thing I recommend is a timer. Um, and you can get phone apps, um, you know, if you have a smart phone, your computer, your your regular telephone, I mean, uh, a regular um, uh, mobile phone probably even has just a basic timer in it. Your computer, you can download free meditation timers, you can just Google "free meditation timers." 

00:38:45
ALEJANDRA Yeah, my watch has it. 

00:38:45
DIANE GEHARD Yeah, so, anything but an egg timer that goes tick tick tick tick tick. 

00:38:50
ALEJANDRA Yeah. Uh-huh. 

00:38:50
DIANE GEHARD That's the only one I don't recommend. But anything that'll, you know, uh, have a pleasant sound. And the reason I recommend the timer is cuz that way you can sit down and not become anxious. Oh, is it, is it time, or, how long has it been, you know, is it time for me to get up, oh, am I gonna be late to work. You, you don't start, you know there's this tendency to wonder how long has it been, you know, I wanna go check the clock. So the timer, you just turn it on, and it'll, you know, start you, and it'll let you know when you're done, and so you can just focus on what you're doing, you don't have to worry abbot running over with your meditation. So I do recommend using a timer. I think it kinda makes the whole thing fit better. The other thing you can use, um, actually on my website there are lots of free downloadable � I have guided meditations, and also just a timer. You can have an MP3, and you can just have a, I have a I think five-minute, 10-minute, 15-minute, so I'll start you off and that way, you know. Sometimes it feels like you're not totally alone. They're like, "Yeah, I hear your voice every day," so, the people who like to use it. So for some people it just makes it feel like they're not totally alone in the whole affair, and, and you can, there are lots of websites and, um, you know, where you can either buy and/or download other free, um, mindfulness-based meditations. So, there are tons of 'em out there. You can go on Youtube, you know, good stuff out there, so, so anyways, so there a lot, and there are some resources also in the handout I'll give you. Um, UCLA in particular, I'm familiar with, and they have some, uh, mindfulness meditations for free on their websites too. Yeah, so for a lot of people that kind of somehow, you get the CD or you got your MP3, and you can just play it and it just helps create the routine, which is really the key thing. 

00:40:25
ALEJANDRA Yeah, I was thinking if they have it of doing � 

00:40:30
DIANE GEHARD Yes. Yeah. And to make you not feel so alone too when you're doing it somehow. You hear someone else's voice in all of this. So, how are we doing here, Alejandra? 

00:40:40
ALEJANDRA Doing good, it sounds really good. 

00:40:40
DIANE GEHARD Do you, have you ever done anything like this before? 

00:40:45
ALEJANDRA I've done relaxation and, yeah, but not, not this type of thing. 

00:40:50
DIANE GEHARD Okay. And so now do you have any questions about how to do it? In terms, cuz we're gonna, in a minute, when you're ready, we're gonna start the timer and we're gonna both meditate together. And, um, would you, focusing on the breath, knowing that your mind is gonna wander off. 

00:41:05
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm. 

00:41:05
DIANE GEHARD And then when it does, was there a particular image that fit for you? Did you, I mean, did you like the image of the, the clouds, or just saying, "Yes, and that too," or labeling it. Was any of those kind of fit for you? 

00:41:15
ALEJANDRA I like the yes, and that too. 

00:41:15
DIANE GEHARD Yes, that too. 

00:41:15
ALEJANDRA And then put it into a bubble and let it go. 

00:41:20
DIANE GEHARD Okay. You combined two of 'em. 

00:41:20
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

00:41:20
DIANE GEHARD Excellent! Okay, very good. So, and then coming back to focusing on your breath. Mmkay. So � 

00:41:25
ALEJANDRA And not beating myself up. 

00:41:30
DIANE GEHARD And not beating yourself up. 

00:41:30
ALEJANDRA Okay. 

00:41:30
DIANE GEHARD That's the most important part. And I think for you that is gonna be -- 

00:41:30
ALEJANDRA Yeah. 

00:41:30
DIANE GEHARD -- the hardest part of the whole thing. 

00:41:35
ALEJANDRA I think so. 

00:41:35
DIANE GEHARD Do you, uh, okay, shall, are you ready to start? 

00:41:40
ALEJANDRA Oh yeah. 

00:41:40
DIANE GEHARD Sure. Okay, so this is my little meditation app on my iPhone. And, um, and so yeah, I don't know, it's a buck or two. And we're just gonna, I'm gonna start it, you'll hear little Tibetan bells start us off and in 60 seconds, um, it'll ring again, and then you can open your eyes, or we'll reconnect then and see how, see if you have any questions, okay? 

00:42:00
ALEJANDRA Okay. 

00:42:00
DIANE GEHARD Okay. 

00:42:00
ALEJANDRA Should I, should I sit like that? 

00:42:00
DIANE GEHARD Yeah, if you wanna sit, any way that's comfortable for you. The main thing is for you to be comfortable. 

00:42:10
[sil.] 

00:42:25
ALEJANDRA That was too fast. 

00:42:25
DIANE GEHARD Was it? 

00:42:30
ALEJANDRA It was a minute? 

00:42:30
DIANE GEHARD Did that not seem like a minute to you? 

00:42:30
ALEJANDRA Like five seconds. 

00:42:30
DIANE GEHARD Good. Well good, that's a sign that you should be practicing longer than a minute. And that is what I would say, is that you practice, and that's, so you already felt like you could've, you wanted to stay in it longer. And so you might actually be ready to start with five minutes and I don't recommend you move up to seven or ten minutes until you feel that feeling that you just felt which is, yeah, I wanna stay here longer, I don't � stop, be quiet, bell, I'm not done. So, so good, so how was it for you? 

00:43:00
ALEJANDRA Hm. You're more aware of noise and internal noise like my tummy. 

00:43:05
DIANE GEHARD Mm-hmm. 

00:43:10
ALEJANDRA And it's like bunch of thoughts coming. 

00:43:15
DIANE GEHARD Mm-hmm. 

00:43:15
ALEJANDRA And, oh yes, that too, bye-bye. 

00:43:20
DIANE GEHARD Were you able to redirect? 

00:43:20
ALEJANDRA Yes. 

00:43:20
DIANE GEHARD Good, and were you able to do it without beating yourself up? 

00:43:25
ALEJANDRA Yeah, I was reminding myself be kind. 

00:43:25
DIANE GEHARD Good. 

00:43:25
ALEJANDRA Kind, and then I. And I started thinking of mix, saying peace? Somebody in the article said something about having like a word? Like a ... 

00:43:35
DIANE GEHARD A mantra? 

00:43:40
ALEJANDRA Yeah, I forgot the name of it. And I thought of, breathe peace, or something. 

00:43:40
DIANE GEHARD Peace in and peace out. So, yeah, one of the ways, there are a couple of, some people like to have, um, something to help them focus besides � Cuz, for some people focusing on the breath is, isn't kind of concrete enough for them, so you can use a mantra. You can use that to focus on, and and you can focus in peace out, peace in. Um, you can use Christian, um, mantras, you know. Um, you can also use counting. And some people just counting each breathe, just counting, not to be competitive so you're just gonna count to one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 and then go back to one, and just kinda keep repeating you know, breath one, two. And for some people that kinda anchors their attention a little bit better and they find it very useful in terms of, um, focusing. 

00:44:30
ALEJANDRA Yeah, so, it felt good. 

00:44:30
DIANE GEHARD Did it? 

00:44:30
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:44:30
DIANE GEHARD Okay. And you kinda understood what to do, in terms of, you had moments where you remember kind of focusing on the breath, the attention got lost, and then you were able to bring it back. 

00:44:40
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm. I think -- 

00:44:45
DIANE GEHARD Without beating yourself up. 

00:44:45
ALEJANDRA Yeah, I think I got like, probably the last few seconds, probably five, I don't know, the last few seconds like in this like blank state. 

00:44:55
DIANE GEHARD Mm, mm-hmm. 

00:44:55
ALEJANDRA It was interesting. 

00:44:55
DIANE GEHARD So your mind got really really quiet? 

00:45:00
ALEJANDRA Yeah, and time flew. 

00:45:00
DIANE GEHARD And time flew. 

00:45:00
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm. 

00:45:00
DIANE GEHARD Wonderful, wonderful. And so, and not to burst your bubble, cuz you seem pretty happy about it right now, but I'd like to let you know, there are gonna be days where you feel really great after practicing, and there'll be days you're like, "What was that all about? I didn't get anything outta that. I'm not gonna do this, I didn't get more relaxed." And you know. And, and that's, there is a discipline to mindfulness where it's something you to a little bit everyday and somedays you're gonna sit down and it's gonna feel great afterwards and that'll hopefully make you wanna do it again, and there'll be other days where you sit down and you just feel almost more frustrated. Um, but there's this discipline and this regularity of the practice, helps you kind of deepen it and deepen it over time. 

00:45:35
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm. 

00:45:35
DIANE GEHARD And it sounds like you got it into, you know, some space where your mind got very quiet and, um, um, sounds like you enjoyed that. 

00:45:45
ALEJANDRA I did. 

00:45:45
DIANE GEHARD Yeah, and you could, it helped you feel a little bit different when you came out of it. And so I just like to forewarn people that when you do this every day, you know, there'll be some days that are just more, you know, exciting than others in terms of practicing. 

00:46:00
ALEJANDRA When should I do, starting? 

00:46:05
DIANE GEHARD Well, yes, so now we gotta get down to coming up with a plan. Cuz I would say the hardest part of mindfulness, as hard as it can be to watch you mind wander back and redirect, and be nice to yourself, that's all hard enough, but I find most people, just, what they really struggle with is fitting it into their routines. And most of our lives, in the 21st century, seem to be so busy that when we say just five minutes a day, we'll restructure your brain so that you have a more positive, happier disposition, you're more likely to be happy. Even though most of us can say, "Yeah, that sounds so good, I wanna do it and I wanna be ha -- I wanna be happier and I wanna be less stressed," and, but it's making five minutes in most of our days to do this seems to be a real challenge. And I think there is this cultural bias that to just sit down and do nothing is like, I don't know, it's lazy or it's non-productive, and I have real important things to do, and so it's like, this is the bottom of the to-do list and the first thing that gets cut, cuz it looks like you're not doing anything. And, um, that's what I think is gonna be the, the greatest challenge. 

00:47:10
ALEJANDRA To find, to find a time. 

00:47:10
DIANE GEHARD To find a time. 

00:47:10
ALEJANDRA You mentioned something, cuz I already pray. I pray at nights. 

00:47:15
DIANE GEHARD Oh, do you? 

00:47:15
ALEJANDRA Yeah, right before going to bed. 

00:47:15
DIANE GEHARD Okay. And so then that's perfect, cuz what I like, what I suggest is that you, you look at your Monday through Friday since you work Monday through Friday. 

00:47:25
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm. 

00:47:25
DIANE GEHARD And, um, and Monday through Friday, that you find five minutes in the day. 

00:47:30
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm. 

00:47:30
DIANE GEHARD That, and find a routine that you're doing every day, like, praying at night is a good option. Um, that you can attach this to. And so, every time you pray, then you can do you five minutes of mindfulness before or after. 

00:47:45
ALEJANDRA Mm-hmm. 

00:47:45
DIANE GEHARD Whichever, you know, you can experiment to see which one feels better for you. Some people like to meditate first and then go into prayer, cuz you kinda clear your head and then move into prayer. And, so that's a great option. Another option, though, you had some struggles with your boss at work, you could also put it at the beginning of the work day, or the middle of, you know, at lunchtime or something if you have a break. If you don't, don't have glass walls at your office, you know, but, but, um, that's another option too, since, you know. 

00:48:10
ALEJANDRA Like, before the meeting with the boss. 

00:48:10
DIANE GEHARD Yes. Something like that could be helpful. So, but you want, um, is, do you have thoughts about what might be a something you do every day, like routine, where you have a fair amount of control over your time, you're not too tired, and you're pretty likely to stay on schedule. Like some people put it in with their, um, you know, morning breakfast routine, or their morning getting dressed and ready routine. Um. 

00:48:40
ALEJANDRA I'm too busy in the mornings and I'm just running around. 

00:48:45
DIANE GEHARD Okay. 

00:48:45
ALEJANDRA But, like, I never skip my praying thing. 

00:48:50
DIANE GEHARD Then that's perfect, I think. 

00:48:50
ALEJANDRA Cuz I'm disciplined, and I, I try to make it before reading, something and ... 

00:48:55
DIANE GEHARD Okay. So, but for most people it also really helps to have a special space dedicated to it, or at least a special chair. Um, and you know, some people, you might wanna have, you know, your Bible or your cross or something, you know, spiritual, um, there. But just some kind of dedicated space, um, for the practice, because it's such a, in some ways, an invisible thing in our lives that, um, it helps to have something to see to even remind yourself to do it and to know that there's a particular space. And I, I, you know, our minds are creatures, our minds are creatures of habit in that, um, when you sit down and do the same thing in the same place every day, you kind of fall into the routine a little bit simpler. And so I do think having a, a creating routine and ritual around it makes it easier to stick with it. And then when you randomly fit it into different places and different, you know, every day's gotta different thing, in a different place, then you ten --, it tends to be easier to just let it fall away. So, so yeah.

ALEJANDRA I like the idea of the special chair, and. 

00:49:55
DIANE GEHARD Mm-hmm. The other thing that a lot of people find useful is to have a little, just log, that I've created. And you can just put for how long you meditated on the days and whether you took the day off. And just to take some notes about, you know, what worked and what didn't. Add sometimes just seeing this helps people feel like, okay, I'm gonna check off five days, and they, you know, they, uh, use this to help kind of keep them motivated to stick with it. 

00:50:20
ALEJANDRA Uh-huh, kind of track how I'm doing too. 

00:50:25
DIANE GEHARD Yeah. 

00:50:25
ALEJANDRA From now on, can we, like, incorporate it to our regular � when we � 

00:50:25
DIANE GEHARD To our sessions? Yes, and we can spend as much or as little time as you would like. We can start, sometimes people like to start with just two minutes, cuz I know you're coming through traffic to get here and it's just kinda, you know, clear your mind and so we can certainly do that when we start the sessions if you'd like. 

00:50:45
ALEJANDRA All right. 

00:50:45
DIANE GEHARD Okay. 

00:50:45
