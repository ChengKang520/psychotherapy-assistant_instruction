00:01:50
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Hi Robbin. Thanks for having me. 

00:01:55
ROBBIN MILLER You're welcome. So ahh, (inaudible ) that you have been published and ahh, in the last couple of years. So why don’t you tell the viewers a little bit about yourself. 

00:02:00
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI RN, MS, CRRN Amm, let's say, I'm a woman of course. Let's say I've been sitting in a wheelchair for approximately 25 years. I've been a registered nurse for about 26, 27 years and I've been pretty much lecturing and educating people on all types of aspects on disability. 

00:02:20
ROBBIN MILLER Okay, well let's begin with our first topic. Ahh, I suppose a lot of people ask you, ahh whether or not persons with disability is a sexual beings. Can you comment on that? 

00:02:30
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Ah, yeah, I think a lot of times people are unsure whether or not people with disabilities can have sex, I guess. I mean, you might find, ahh someone in a wheelchair attractive, ah a man or a woman and I find that a lot of people will shy away from making that first initial step at initiating conversation or something because they assume that people are not sexual, people who have disabilities are not sexual. But the fact is, is that people with disabilities are sexual have sex and actually enjoy it pretty much some. 

00:03:00
ROBBIN MILLER Could you safely say that ahh, let's take a child growing up in a home with disability. 

00:03:05
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Hmm, hmmm. 

00:03:05
ROBBIN MILLER Okay, either they are a quite or they were born with a disability. 

00:03:10
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Hmm, hmmm. 

00:03:10
ROBBIN MILLER Is there any different in how the child whether it's a boy or a girl, if they're taught sex by their parents or their peers, is there any difference? 

00:03:20
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Ahh, well between a boy with a disability and a young girl with a disability, I'm not sure that would depend on, on the parent's influence and what their basic understanding and, and their values and beliefs are on sexuality, ah, there are many different ways to look at that. 

00:03:35
Miller chat 

00:03:35
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI I think that in general, children who were born with disabilities or developed disabilities at an early age on pre-adolescent, ah I think they have a hard time because they don’t have any real role models to, to follow, you can't, you can't turn on a television show and see a teenager in a wheelchair are going through the whole dating ritual or what it's like to, to be a teen in a wheelchair and be sexual and try to date. You just don’t see that on TV. You don't really see that in books, you don’t see that in magazines. It's only until recently that most major magazines will actually have someone in a wheelchair in advertisement. But I think kids with disabilities lack the role models and they, they just don’t really know how to, to establish all of those dating and, and marriage type rituals that, I'd say my, myself I was injured at the age of 23. So, I'd already had dating experiences, I had already even sexual prior to my disability. So I already had ah, preconceived notions of what dating was and what to expect from men, heterosexuals what to expect from men, ah in that whole little dating game. But, once you become disabled all of that pretty much changes as I found that it changed a lot and I find that a lot of people see that it changes, ah there is a hesitancy I believe in what we call them the able bodied or basically the tabs as we call you guys the temporarily able bodied. Ah, they're kind of little frightened I think about people with disabilities and what they can or cannot do in the sexual round so to speak. I think a lot of times I try to read an article once in this, the scrapbook called the perspectives on disability and they talked about people their reactions on when they, when they’re attracted to someone who has the disability that they begin to question themselves why would I be attracted to someone who is (inaudible ) or ahh ahh… 

00:05:22
ROBBIN MILLER Yeah. 

00:05:25
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI …disfigured and does that make me strange to wanna be involve with that person romantically. So, I think people tend to go through a lot of different, different feelings and I think a lot of times people have difficulty seeing beyond the disability whether it be the use of a walker or a cane or a wheelchair, ahh they just have difficulty seeing beyond that, because they just don’t have the experience with people with disabilities. They don’t realize that, ahh we (inaudible ) the disability community are people with feelings and emotions just like everybody else. 

00:05:55
ROBBIN MILLER Yeah, you know reflecting on that you're right, ahh when I was growing up and we took sex, ahh sex ed(ph). Ahh, we weren’t even thought sexual education, but when we look through books, magazines, never ever in the 80s did we ever see anybody, who was a disabled individual. 

00:06:10
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Right. 

00:06:15
ROBBIN MILLER In a picture and even on TV, ah I never really saw it. But I do remember having a few people on movies were in wheelchairs like My Left Foot. 

00:06:20
Miller Chat 

00:06:20
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Oh yeah. 

00:06:25
ROBBIN MILLER Ahh, and all that and I wanted to ask you that. Ahh, when they show people with disabilities men and women do they tend to show or they favor their gender who is more sexual, is it mostly the men they saw they tend to show more sexual than women, in the media? 

00:06:40
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI In… in the media which shows disabilities… 

00:06:40
ROBBIN MILLER With those movies… yeah, in the movies. Is that, you know. 

00:06:45
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Hmm… Gee well you think about it, yeah probably yes, I think on My Left Foot, I think of ahh, The Coming Home, the Jon Voight, the old Jon Voight Jane Fonda film. Jon voight was the cute carp(ph) in that in that chair carp(ph) of course, being a term that I can use, but you can't. Ahh, so a man with the disability, he was pretty, pretty cute. And the only female versions I’ve really seen are the, The Other Side of the Mountain kind of stuff and I don’t really recall a lot of sexual scenes in that. And ahh, I haven’t seen other movies that have women with disabilities as the main characters, you know. It's ahh, it’s a whole interesting concept of trying to be a sexual person and have a disability when the societal perceptions and viewpoints either you're asexual and you don’t have sex or don’t want sex and the reality is this, those people want to have sex just like everybody else wants to have sex. 

00:07:35
ROBBIN MILLER Moving on into the second question its interesting even today, when I work with ah parents with children with disabilities or adults specially men or women and always the men tend to be more ferocious like they go to this triple X rated show but come back with kisses and put (inaudible )you know. But the women I speak to are like oh, oh, no… ha ha ha you know, especially when the husband leaves them. Can you comment on that? I mean… 

00:07:55
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI What do you mean that they they're going to a pornographic movies? 

00:08:00
ROBBIN MILLER Yeah… 

00:08:00
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI But the wife isn’t going or the wife is going or not. 

00:08:00
ROBBIN MILLER Oh, no not their wife oh, no, no, no, no. 

00:08:05
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Oh, I'm sorry. 

00:08:05
ROBBIN MILLER Ha ha ha… let me clarify that. I’m saying single men… 

00:08:10
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Hmm, hmm. 

00:08:10
ROBBIN MILLER …tend to be more ferocious, they tend to be, if they see a beautiful woman whether they’re able bodied or not they’ll tend and wanna flirt or grab her or something like that. They tend to be more external, but as supposed to women who are especially if their husbands leave them or they get a divorce or whatever. All of a sudden, when you talk about sexuality, like oh no, you know I’ve been married, oh you know, I don’t need to do that anymore or Oh I don’t think I can do that. Do you find that being a nurse when you were working with people on rehab? 

00:08:35
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Oh, when I work with people in rehab depending upon the age of the person, who has the disability that ahh… I think a lot of times when you’re newly injured, ahh you don't think you can have sex or I know that’s of really of a question that’s in the forefront of your mind, is can I? And will I? And will anyone want to with me? I think it is a big point. Ahh the, the issue you’re making I think between men being more ahh, openly aggressive sexually I think or more ahh confrontive I guess and women not being that might be more of a generational thing. 

00:09:05
ROBBIN MILLER Hmm, hmm. 

00:09:05
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI I don’t know, if I think women of today tend to be more like that or not. I think, women of today maybe, may be more sexually aggressive… 

00:09:10
ROBBIN MILLER Hmm, hmmm. 

00:09:10
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI …and may make the first move for a man might not. But I think in the far as in the realm of, of disability, ah I think in general people may tend to be more hesitant because out of fear of rejection or more fear of rejection and not knowing what the other person or how the other person will react to them. I think that is, that is the main issue. 

00:09:35
ROBBIN MILLER So a (inaudible ) of people expressing themselves they tend to in terms of gender there’s really no difference that you see in terms of men or women being less or more aggressive. 

00:09:40
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI With disabilities? 

00:09:40
ROBBIN MILLER Yeah… 

00:09:45
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Or just in general? 

00:09:45
ROBBIN MILLER In general, I mean women or men with disabilities maybe 20 years ago men used be the forefront they use to wanna have sex. But you are saying that today’s degeneration it tends to be more on the same plain field in terms of men and women being, I guess wanting to have sex and be more open about sex and fun of, aggressive… 

00:10:00
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, I guess that depends on the individual and how they were, they were brought up. 

00:10:05
ROBBIN MILLER Hmm, hmm. 

00:10:05
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI I mean, I think it depends on what their sexual experiences are. 

00:10:05
ROBBIN MILLER Hmm, hmm. 

00:10:05
Miller Chat 

00:10:10
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Hmm… I think if you have a bad sexual experience, you may never want to have another one. Ahh… I know some friends of mine think that it's ahh, you know it's not really a great thing. They really don’t enjoy it and I just tend to wonder why they don’t enjoy it. Ahh, you know we have to look at the reasons for that. If they psychologically can't, can't enjoy themselves because of some sort of societal or historical issues they have from growing up or whether they just don’t like it. I mean some people tend to choose to be celebrate(ph) and choose not to have sex, they just don’t, don’t wanna be involved in that. 

00:10:40
ROBBIN MILLER Well and you're training as a, a registered nurse, I know you, you told me you worked in rehab. 

00:10:45
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Yes. 

00:10:45
ROBBIN MILLER And you work with newly disabled. 

00:10:45
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Disabled. Yes, and older, people with older injuries too. Yeah. 

00:10:50
ROBBIN MILLER Ah… did you ever do, ahh elderly individuals who now at 60 they had a stroke. 

00:10:55
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Oh, yeah. 

00:10:55
ROBBIN MILLER Ahh, so is there any difference in your presentation and training somebody who is like a young newly disabled supposed to an elderly individual, who is now I guess newly disabled, we know that is there any difference in how you approach that? 

00:11:10
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Ahh… yeah, you’d, you’d, I pretty much whenever I, ahh talk about the, the subject of sexuality, I try to always approach it as a matter of fact kind of thing that it's an everyday and it's an everyday topic that people need to be aware of because sexual health is, is really important. You need to be healthy sexually as well as healthy in, you know cardio… cardio logically or, or urinary wise. Ahh, so I approach in that manner and you can usually tell by the way the person reacts to you as to whether they’re open with talking about it or whether they’re not open with talking about it and I find elder folks, you know those maybe in their 60s or 70s tend to be pretty shy and pretty ahh, closed or more internal about their sexual feelings. They’re not really eager or they can't voice it as openly as younger people can. And those with, ahh those younger individuals who have injuries, ahh I find they're always wondering about it always thinking about it, ahh whether they’re going to be able to perform sexually or be, or be perceived as a sexual person. Whether they are in a relationship or whether they are not in a relationship. 

00:12:15
ROBBIN MILLER Do you work in all aspects of the cycle? 

00:12:20
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI All… all aspects, you know. 

00:12:20
ROBBIN MILLER So besides teaching sexuality, did you also have to go with like for women pertaining particularly their menstrual habits, ahh did you have to discuss birth control with them? And guys you probably had to discuss other issues. Was that also your role as a certified rehab nurse? 

00:12:35
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Yeah. Ahh, basically we taught people how to manage their bodies, their changed bodies after disability and how all those ahh, bodily functions are affected. So, whether it be menstruation or whether it be, ahh bowel or bladder or the ability to move within their environments. The ability to walk or feel things, as touch wise feel things. 

00:12:55
ROBBIN MILLER So you’re really open about it? 

00:13:00
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Yeah, I’ve been talking about this for over 20 years, I can pretty much talk about anything even over a dinner. Ha ha ha… yep. 

00:13:05
ROBBIN MILLER But, you know it's interesting that when I’ve been to several rehab places in town, I don’t know I couldn’t name them, but ahh when I saw people who’re newly disabled they were just totally lost and they depended on another agencies to come in and to give them services, but ahh, when I asked them about all dating habits or anything, anybody talked to you about it like, you know. You find coming and is there a lack of, I don't know, if they're trained people or people who just don’t want to talk about with people in this area. 

00:13:35
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, I mean ahh, the topic of sex itself is ahh, is a topic that makes some people very uncomfortable, they can't even talk about it. They get nervous. They laugh, they giggle, ahh you know, a lot of times when you’re, when you’re trying to do sex with, with certain individuals you have to pretty much talk on their levels. You may have to use street language, you know or you don’t always want to use medical jargon, coz it takes away from that. That sense of that it's an everyday common kind of activity. Ahh, but a lot of people don’t talk about it, can't talk about it. In, in my experience as a, as a nurse with the (inaudible ) the last rehab hospital I worked at I was called the sex lady, call the sex lady, she’ll come and talk about it. No one else talked about it. They always called me to talk about it. And I think because I'm personally have a disability as well, it makes it easier for me sometimes to establish relationships with people, but not always all the time. Because sometimes they look at me and see what they have become and they really don’t like to look at that. So sometimes it's, it's not easy that that peer thing is not really there at the beginning sometimes. But in general, I’d have to say that sex and dating is not really something that’s discussed in acute hospital settings, because you know, with ahh, let's see with basic cost containment going on right now, sex is not considered a priority in most people’s books. So it's usually not discussed. 

00:14:50
Miller Chat 

00:14:55
ROBBIN MILLER So there is a lot of people, who are probably confused or probably don’t even know about sexuality when they believe that, so basically they, they're on their own? 

00:15:00
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Yeah, pretty much time, or we you know, when, when I worked on you know, I always made certain to give them my phone number that they could call me and that we could discuss it. We always gave written materials for people, ahh to utilize as well as refer them to independent living centers within their areas or support groups that they then could talk to people about those issues. But, but sex is, is a hard thing for people to talk about. It's hard to talk about that you don’t get it. I mean, you know people, you know especially, ahh it all depends on the type of person you are. You like to let people think you, you’re a sexual being, you may be in sexual relationships, it's, it's difficult for some people to admit that they’ve not. I mean, I know people with disabilities with 30, 40, 45 years old that have never, never had sex in their whole life. Want to, but just don’t have the opportunities. So… 

00:15:45
ROBBIN MILLER Either because they don’t know how or they just can't… 

00:15:50
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, it's not that they don’t know how to have sex, I think maybe their, their partners are limited or they just don’t have the opportunities to meet people. I mean, when you think about it ahh, when I was injured in 1975, I mean I couldn’t probably even go into a restaurant or, or a bar or a, you know a place to dance back in 1975. So, when I was 23 newly injured, I really didn’t have the opportunity to go out and, and really date again or try to attempt a date, because I couldn’t get in any place. Ahh, you couldn’t meet people and again because people tend to be hesitant with someone with a disability they don’t know if they’re sick or they’re contagious, ahh you know, they don’t have sex anyways, so why would I wanna start a relationship with them and then there’s that whole thing of being a friend with them, but maybe not pursuing that into a romantic relationship. I know lots of people that have lots of female or male friends that they might wanna get involved with, but they don’t know how to approach that or they feel the other person doesn’t want that. They just want to stay friends. Ahh, so it's just, it's just a hard subject to talk about and it's, it’s a hard issue for people to, to pretty much try to get, ahh I guess involved with other people it’s, a it’s a difficult thing. 

00:17:05
ROBBIN MILLER Getting into the next question, ahh did you find when you were newly disabled, did you find either the stereotype or the attitude that you should only date people with the similar disabilities? 

00:17:15
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Disabilities yeah. The like I should stay with the like, I guess. Ahh, yeah, actually that’s, that’s pretty much what a lot of people think is that, ahh people with disability should date and marry only people with disabilities, but then of course never have children in, because you know we don’t want to propagate more, more people with disabilities. I mean, you run into some pretty redneck narrow-minded viewpoints. I mean that’s they’re out there everywhere. Ahh, and then there were those individuals I can remember once being in, in Reno, Nevada and being in the slot machine, some guy just came over to me and started asking me all these sexual questions about, could I have sex? How could I have sex? I didn’t know him from a (inaudible ) in the world, but he felt like, he could just ask me any question that occurred in his mind. He might never ask that to another, an able bodied woman but he would definitely ask me those questions. Ahh, and I can tell you that just myself driving around in my car men are attracted to me, you could tell that they look at me but once I get out of my car they kind of run in the other direction, it's kind of interesting. I’m not sure that, I could remember a story in, in San Francisco, when ahh, I’d say it was my birthday and we were going to this club that was pretty much a meat market and I thought it looked pretty good and I was trying to ram my big car into this little parking spot and couldn’t really do it. And this car load of this three really beautiful people two guys and a pulled up and the driver kind of was winking at me, and saying let me take that spot you know, I buy you a drink once we get into the, into the bar. 

00:18:40
ROBBIN MILLER Hmm, hmm. 

00:18:40
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI So I let him have the spot and I held him accountable for the drink, but when we got in the bar he never came near me. I had to finally approach him and say, where is my drink? And he’s like, You were the one driving? I’m like, yes. He bought me a drink and, and pretty much left. 

00:18:55
ROBBIN MILLER And took off? 

00:18:55
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI And took off, yeah. That’s pretty common thing. And the thing with that you should one date people with disabilities, ahh that's another interesting concept, because a lot of men with disabilities won't date women with disabilities. So there’s a… 

00:19:05
ROBBIN MILLER Hmm. 

00:19:05
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI …there’s even a bias within the, within the community itself. And that has to do with a lot of times how they grew up? What their perceptions of disability were, when they were, when they were, ahh ageing you know, before their disability. 

00:19:20
ROBBIN MILLER Yes, yes. Let's, let's come in a little bit. I was reading about pre-injury and post-injury. And I remember reading about, ahh for example, ahh a couple is married, they're both able bodied, so called able bodied. Ahh, the husband gets into a car accident, okay he’s now a (inaudible ), the woman I was reading about decides not to become the wife anymore. She is now a caregiver. Can you explain a little dynamics is that, what happens there in terms of sexuality and relationship? How do they, does the whole relationship change? 

00:20:00
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, in some cases it does change. When I teach people and before they leave the hospital, I, I recommend that though this, the lover whether it be a wife or whatever does not or husband does not do the physical care on the person unless it's an emergency and the attendant doesn’t show up. Because I think, those boundaries get crossed and ahh, when you’re always taking care of someone washing bodies helping them with you know, elimination of urine or feces that the whole sexuality, the whole attractiveness may kind of diminish. And it may end up seeming more like work instead of managing or helping a lover. So I, I don’t agree with that, ahh I just think again in emergency situations, but I think in two or three people that I know when they had done that type of thing the relationships never survived. So, I think you have to be a really strong, have a really strong relationship in order to have something like that to life. 

00:20:55
ROBBIN MILLER Well, it definitely changes everything? 

00:20:55
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Yes. 

00:21:00
ROBBIN MILLER The relationship. Comment about the divorce rate, is that high among, ahh for example, let's look at post-injury, this case for now, an example a couple has married able bodied husband gets disabled. What do you think is the post-injury have a high divorce rate than pre-injury? 

00:21:15
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI I don’t know, from the last that I read, I think it's a tad higher but, but pretty much equal in the divorce rate. It's whether or not people get married, as lot of people with disabilities never get married. 

00:21:25
ROBBIN MILLER Hmm, hmm. 

00:21:25
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Ahh, so they never marry, they never have sex, so they never have a divorce. But I think the divorce rate is pretty much equal between able bodied and disabled population. 

00:21:35
ROBBIN MILLER Well, I also read that a lot of disabled people who don’t get married and there might be other financial reasons involved. For example doing the system… 

00:21:45
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Right 

00:21:45
ROBBIN MILLER Social Security. 

00:21:45
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Hmm hmmm 

00:21:45
ROBBIN MILLER Ahh, we all know how wonderful that can be, and what a wonderful experience they have to encounter with Social Security. Or Medicaid or whatever. Then having children just probably makes it more complicated, it's like being in a welfare… 

00:21:55
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Hmm, hmmm. 

00:22:00
ROBBIN MILLER You're Getting married, your financial considerations are now in a different state. 

00:22:00
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Hmm, hmmm. 

00:22:05
ROBBIN MILLER So you're saying there’s really no difference in terms of divorce rate with the pre or post-injury? 

00:22:05
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI I don’t believe so, it maybe a tad higher in, ahh post-injury and regarding the disability insurance or Social Security stuff, yes a lot of people do not marry, because they will lose benefits if they, if they get married they will get a decrease in their monthly payments if they marry. 

00:22:25
ROBBIN MILLER Right. 

00:22:25
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI I know some couples in California though that have fought the system in once, so there are ways to beat it, but it takes a lot of work in the, in the court system. 

00:22:30
Miller Chat 

00:22:30
ROBBIN MILLER What do you think are the greatest challenges today? Let's look at, let's look at today and let's look at the past. Okay, maybe your generation probably 60s, 70s. And now 2000 and the future, what do you think are the issues right now facing people with disabilities in terms of expression of sexuality? Let's, let's go back for 30 years. 

00:22:50
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Hmm, hmmm. 

00:22:50
ROBBIN MILLER Okay and let's go to the past and let's go to the present and the future, so comment on the past. 

00:22:55
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, on the past people with disabilities didn’t have sex. They may have, ahh may have had sex but it may have been in sexual(ph) abuse by caregivers at that point. But people did not, ahh well probably a smattering of people were sexual. But I think the, the overall comprehensive look of that is pretty much that people with disabilities were not, ahh sexual they were pretty much kept institutionalized or in you know, in the home. It didn’t really traverse the community, because things were not accessible at all 30 years ago. And then I think in the 70s with the independent living movement and people wanting to who were housing nursing homes deciding that they wanted to come out and live normal lives like everybody else and that’s exactly what we want is just to be normal like everybody else, we just maybe look and move around a little differently. But ahh, that’s when things started to ahh, to kind of come about where accessibility laws were established with new buildings had to be made accessible, ahh which made things a little bit easier, but it never broke down those attitude, no barriers, no stereotypes. So, ahh society in general I think still believe that people with disabilities are not sexual and do not want to date or have children, when a lot of times people do. And I think in the future I hope, I’m hoping that the future for American society anyway which is I like and speak for at this point is that, that they’ll finally grow up and realize that people with disabilities are just people too they just again look a little different move around a little differently. 

00:24:20
ROBBIN MILLER So you’re thinking that attitudes and behaviors will change in (inaudible ). 

00:24:25
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, I think the only way attitudes can change is that the barriers, physical barriers need to be removed and then of course the only way physical barriers need to be removed, if people need to realize that, ahh we need to allow, I mean I didn’t say that the society needs to allow us in, it's pretty much what it is. Then when you built stairs and don’t built ramps and, you know it always too narrow, it prevents us from leading normal lives like everybody else wants to lead. 

00:24:50
ROBBIN MILLER Well, a few minutes ago, I wanna comment on dating that we have here. Dating is a time to get to know a person and to experiment with sexual expression such kissing, hugging, and petting. How do you kiss or hug someone who uses a wheelchair or who can't move their arms very well? Comment on it to our viewers to give them information. 

00:25:05
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Yeah, I think, I think when people with disabilities those who use wheelchairs or other type of scooters or any of those types of mobility impairments, when they’re dating, I think its hard if they’re dating a person whose able bodied that just who knows to make the first move, how do you make the first move? If you’re a man are you used to, you know putting your arm around that person and if you can't lift that arm anymore, how do you, how do you do that? Ahh, you have to ask somebody, please I’d like to hug you. Can you put my arm around your shoulder? I’d like to kiss you, could you come over here and lean down and kiss me. Or a lot of times people will actually sit on people’s laps straddle them looking at each other and make out that way so to speak. Ahh, so there are ways to do that and then when there are two people in wheelchairs logistically it becomes even a little harder because you have to deal with two large inanimate objects… 

00:25:50
ROBBIN MILLER Hmm hmm 

00:25:50
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI …with people in it who want to get close and kiss and touch and, ahh all I can say is people find a way, when they wanna get close and they wanna have sex then you find a way. 

00:26:05
ROBBIN MILLER Did the expression is there’s a will there’s a way? 

00:26:05
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, definitely when it comes to sex, yeah. 

00:26:05
ROBBIN MILLER But for the newly disabled or maybe for people who’re born with disability, do they ahh first in their mind do they feel that the wheelchair or their equipment is now part of their sexual being do you work with that and say, you know it maybe in a wheelchair, but you’re still a sexual being and you don’t need your wheelchair to have sex put it that way. 

00:26:25
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, you don’t but sometimes it becomes a good tool. Ha ha ha… you can have sex on your wheelchair. Ahh, but, ahh yeah, I think after some point, I think initially with the new injury analysis, again personal what I’ve read is that people see it as a separate entry that it is, ahh you know it's just wheelchair. But eventually it becomes, it becomes integrated into your body image. It becomes part of who you are just like, you know when you put shoes on I guess, I mean because you need it to move around. I can remember the first time, I got a new quickie wheelchair, ahh and basically these are the lightweight models, ahh they’re only like 25 pounds. I was sitting in like a 50 or 60 pound that which was really heavy. But when I got into this one it was great. And I started moving around it. And the first thing I said was that, I want a mirror. Do you have a full length mirror and the guy turns to me and said, "What? Why do you need a mirror for?" I said, "I wanna see, how it looks, you know". 

00:27:10
ROBBIN MILLER Ahh ahh… 

00:27:15
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI But he didn’t, he didn’t get it. And that was back in, in probably 1981 or 82. But ahh, yeah whether it be a cane, a walker, ahh wheelchairs they eventually become a part of who you are. 

00:27:25
ROBBIN MILLER Yeah, I think ahh, I mean a minute to go, I think ahh, we can summarize today that even though, you may have a disability it doesn’t mean you’re, you’re not a sexual being. 

00:27:35
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Exactly. 

00:27:35
ROBBIN MILLER You’re still like, I think it's more or less an attitude, where you also not only do you have to accept it, but I think it's basically the attitude. You got to, you got to change your attitude. You can't worry about other people. Is that correct that we tell people don’t worry about the neighbor? 

00:27:50
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI Well, no you have to, you have make sure that you yourself feel sexual… 

00:27:55
ROBBIN MILLER Hmm hmm… 

00:27:55
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI …and wanna be sexual but then you have to hope that you are perceived that way by a potential partner. So, I think there is some societal… 

00:28:00
ROBBIN MILLER Okay. 

00:28:00
SONYA PERDUTA-FULGINITI …responsibility there that might not be, you might not find that viewpoint in a lot of books. But my feeling is that it's about time society kinda changes their attitude and looks of people with disability is a little bit differently. 

00:28:15
ROBBIN MILLER Okay, well we have to wrap up. Today’s topic was ahh, two, two part series. The first series we talked about personal and social perceptions of disability and their affect on sexual development and sexual ahh, expression. And the second series that will be shown in another time will be more on sexual functioning. My guest today was Sonya Perduta-Fulginiti. She’s an RN MS CRRN, which is a certified rehabilitation registered nurse. Thank you very much. That’s it.
