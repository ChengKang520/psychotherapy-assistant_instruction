MARIA L. MIVILLE Ph.D I am Marie Miville. I’m the Director of the roundtable and we are so pleased to bring to you our two-day conference focused on community oriented programs with racial, cultural topics. Last year, we experienced an historic events regarding the election of our first African-American president. This year though, I’m guessing we are all feeling the pinch of just how difficult genuine change can be to bring about. And so now I'd like to introduce our keynote speaker Dr. Patricia Romney. You know, one of the most rewarding aspects of being part of a conference like this is that I get to bring people that I like whether I’m interested in or I’ve been inspired by, and Dr. Romney is one such person. So, Pat as she likes to be called, has been working as a consultant with organizations and communities for many, many years doing the hard work of helping develop community among despaired groups of people. As she writes, this is no easy task. But Dr. Romney approaches her work with great passion and honesty. She’d shared some of these difficult challenges, some of the misses that she's had. But she has found the way to stay focused and committed to getting and finding a common ground among people and what she calls getting to a we. Just the little bit a back run on the... on Pat, Dr. Romney, she is President of her own business, her own consultation business, Romney Associates. A firm that specializes in consulting to schools and colleges. And so for the last 30 years, she's consulted with academics and academic institutions as well as human service, public sector, arts organizations and the like. She focuses on such issues as diversity, team building and leadership development. She received her Ph.D right here in the city, the City University of New York in Clinical Psychology and she actually won the Bernard Ackerman Award for Outstanding Scholarship in Graduate Psychology. She was a pre-doctoral fellow at the Yale University of Medicine and completed post-graduate study at The College of Executive Coaching. She is now a Visiting Associate Professor of Psychology of Mt. Holyoke College and maintains a clinical practice. Her research, and this is why we wanted her here, focuses on the struggle for social justice and community. She has published many articles and papers including most recently, I love the title of this, The Art of Dialogue and consulting for diversity in social justice. Please join me in welcoming Dr. Romney.

DR. PATRICIA ROMNEY Thank you so much Marie. Good morning every body. I am so pleased to be with you today. Ah... The cross cultural roundtable is such an important gathering and has such a prestige and so, is so well known in our field. And I would really like to thank ah... Dr. Miville for her leadership in ah... sustaining this tradition. Wonderful to be here. The title of my talk today... if I can get to work this powerpoint right! Ah.... is an organizational psychologist's struggle for social justice and the common good. I want to talk with you about threats to social justice and the common good or social justice and community and I wanna talk to you about some breakthroughs that I’ve seen and participated in. Before I start, I'd like to know a little bit more about the audience. How many of you are, are therapists in the audience? Either... Okay, great! How many of you are OD consultants or diversity consultants? Thank you. How many faculty? Wonderful. And researchers, primarily? Okay, wonderful. And students? Wonderful. Hahaha... Great! So, I’m gonna speak today from the perspective of my work as a practitioner. Ah... My... What I do is a practitioner in OD work is to consult mostly to schools and colleges, but also to ah... human service organizations and to arts organizations. And my work is pretty much been throughout the country. Ah... But I’m all in the not for profit sector, which is a little bit unusual for OD consultants who are usually ah... doing more work in the for profit sector. And as you listen, I see there, you know few of you are OD practitioners and some of you I know are students in Organizational Development, and I’d like to think it even if you are therapist or this isn't your field, what I’d like you to do is to think about yourselves as members of organizations. Ah... And think about the ways in which you can act together with your peers and advanced social change in your organization. In 30 years of ah... doing OD consulting, I’ve become aware that how much of our time, we spend living and working ah... and finding(ph) and researching in organizations. And ah... that is where a lot of our life takes place. So, this work I think is very important. I wanna define some terms, this is a group that I know I’m speaking to the knowledgeable and the converted, speaking to the choir in this room. But ah... as we know, diversity is about the people and the faces who are present in our world and in our organizations. For me diversity is about representation and it includes inclusion. Diversity means having representation at all levels of an organization, but we all know that having enough bodies is not enough. It’s been said that diversity is being invited by to the party. And that inclusion is being asked to dance. How many of us are invited to the party but never asked to dance? A social justice frame take some additional steps. Social justice is not just about representation or diversity, it involves inclusion being asked to dance, but it also involves equity and equality. And to continue the party metaphor, social justice means that diverse groups get the opportunity to have a fair share in building the play list, in choosing the records for the dance. Diverse staff get to help set the agenda and to lead not just to follow. So, social justice is an important aspect of all of the work that we do. We’ve been lead to think some of us that social justice is about ah... some radical agenda or some revolutionary agenda, but I would argue otherwise. I think that social justice is about the most democratic of our agendas. The principles of equity and equality, ah... the principles that are part of the foundation of this democracy. So, as you work towards social justice don’t let anybody put you in the mind frame that you are being too radical. You know, we are here to do and to actualize the principles on which this government stands. As Vivian Paley has put it, ‘In a democracy, just like in the first grade, you can't say, you can't play.’ It’s just that simple. And in many of our organizations that is the message, we can't play. The common good is the other concept that I use when doing diversity work. All OD projects are about community, about the common good, about what is good for the whole, for all of us. Without the whole, without the whole entity of what we could call community, there is nothing to do in terms of diversity and social justice. We don’t exist. There is no.. Ah... There is no entity in which to advance our, our thinking and our work. Used by democrats, republicans, liberals, conservatives, progressives, the concept of the... of the common good transcends politics. And it espouses again what’s good for all of us. And I’m gonna go back to my early days as a kid here in New York City and say that ah... the common good speaks to community and it's really that old Brooklyn Dodgers' idea, anybody remember the Brooklyn Dodgers? Hahaha... It's that old Brooklyn Dodgers' idea that we should all rule for the little guy, right? That’s what democracy is about. We all rule for the person who is at the bottom. It's a fundamentally American idea. So, I take it that as axiomatic that to achieve true community, we have to pay equal attention to the least of us and equal attention to the good of all of us. That we have to connect social justice to the common good. And yet, this is one of the most difficult aspects of diversity work. The ability to reconcile the interest of the under represented with the interest of the organization as a whole. And it doesn’t always work. Ah... But working toward it is part of what is important for us to do. In my works, I’ve seen many threats ah... to the development of community, to the development of social justice and organizations and I’d like to talk about four of those threats with you today and to share with you ah... some of the breakthroughs that I’ve seen. And the threats I’m gonna describe today are; one, the threat of ignorance. How does lack of knowledge, lack of cultural competence, lack of cultural humility in our field and in the organizations in which we live and work, how does that threaten our purpose of achieving social justice? I’d also like to talk with you about this threat of superficiality that I see so often when organizations ask an OD consultant to come in and do some diversity work. I know you are all familiar with that, are you? Ah... Some times I call that threat of superficiality, I'm an old ah... person written a lot about eating disorders. I sometimes call it organizations social justice anorexia. Ah... I wanna talk about another threat, the threat of exclusion. What I refer to as a narrow set of we. A narrow sense of what we is? And who we is? And then last, I’d like to talk with you about the threat of exhaustion and hopelessness and the need to sustain ourselves. Ah... Starting with the threat of ignorance or lack of cultural competence on the part of organizations and some times OD consultants themselves, not those of us in this room, but people who go out to do social justice work and know so little about the diversity that exists in an organization. In some ways, this is the easiest threat to overcome, we have so much scholarship on which to rely in the OD field and in the psychology field, ah... overall we have the work of ah... Clay Alderfer of Evangelina Holvino, we have Derrick Suehs(ph) with us and so many other practitioners, David Thomas at School of Business of Harvard, Rita Jackson and Rita Hartiman(ph) and Billie Jackson at the University of Massachusetts. Our licenses today, those of us who are clinical, require us to some level of cultural competence. Yet, we are still challenged in organizations. Think for a minute about academia. I don’t know what it looks like here at Columbia. But despite various efforts in the last 10-20 years, to diversify our faculty our full time faculty in the academy is still quite disproportionately underrepresented in terms of African-American, Haitian and Latino faculty. At predominantly white institutions, like Columbia, which are renounced for their resources and their profitable social networks, their large endowments and high levels of prestige, faculty of color are either noticeably absent or limited in their presence. And when they or we are present, we are often at the lower levels of the academy at the lecturer or visiting or assistant professor level. That’s because black Latino and Haitian faculty are more likely to hold positions in community colleges and historically black colleges and now the new up and coming Latino colleges and universities that are developing throughout our country. So, taken together this presents a rather poor picture. At... The academy is one of the organizations in which inclusion and equity are quite a challenge. And yet some ah... colleges and universities are quite successful. At my own institution, Mt. Holyoke College, we now have a 25% ah... faculty of color. I wanna talk with you for a moment about how we can get ourselves up to speed and how we can work to develop some level of, of cultural competence. I wanna give an example of one organization in the southern United States where I was called to ah... do a consultation. Ah... In this organization, I was called in to give a talk about diversity. And the organization quickly ah... realized that they wanted to do something more than just have a speaker come through. How many of our organizations have speakers come through, ah... do a day on diversity or social justice or minority issues and that’s it? Close the book and that’s done until, until next year. Ah... In this organization, the talk that I was invited to give was followed by a mini assessment. I spent the day, two days actually, going through the college, meeting with leaders in the college and meeting with all faculty of color and all social justice ah... staff in the institution, GLBT ah... staff included. That organization invited me back for a return engagement and involved themselves in a diversity initiative that lasted for three years. And part of my work was consulting to departments, to the provost, to the president and finally supporting and coaching faculty of color who are coming up for tenure. Pretty rare in the organization, in the institution for a faculty of color be afforded, to be afforded the benefit of having some one who has been tenured to work with them as they approach the tenure process. This particular college with a possibility of faculty and staff color, knew how to get what they needed to accomplish a goal. Ah... Excuse me just a minute. They, although not really knowledgeable about social justice, had the, the wisdom and the commitment to invite some one in who had the knowledge and the competence to work with them. And interestingly, talking about acting together ah... and developing community into hope of community, the starting point in this particular institution was one black faculty member and the president of the college. This black faculty member had ah... the courage and the commitment and the need because she was going up to... for tenure, to really engage with the president in a full and contactful way and to encourage him to do more and to do something about diversity. The partnership that they developed changed the face of the institution. And by the way that faculty member ah... has just wrote to me about a week ago to let me know that she had achieved tenure. So, where there is a lack of competence or knowledge, looking for and seeking some kind of help consultation that can move an institution and organization forward ah... is very, very, very important. And it takes commitment to do that. And the commitment again can often come from working with somebody, not trying to be out there on your own, but making a connection with people in powerful places in this case, a white university or college president and a black, new black faculty member at the assistant professor level created a partnership which dramatically changed the college. I wanna talk also with you about another threat. And that is the treat of superficiality.

DR. PATRICIA ROMNEY This little cartoon shows ah... often times when organizations want to do diversity work, and by the way very really can't even think of a time this being made, perhaps one example of being called to do some talking, some work around social justice, right? Were asked to work around diversity, ah... which is a pretty again mainstream idea. It’s wonderful, we need representation. We want to be included. But another way of thinking about the distinction between diversity and social justice is diversity is about who is in the room. And social justice is about what you do when you get in the room, an important distinction. Being in the room and what you do when you get in the room. Ah... I’m reminded at this moment if some of the ah... conversations I’ve been having about Columbia University and it’s relationships to the community ah... here ah... in, in Manhattan, right. And the, what is it called the upper, not the upper, is the upper west side? The upper west side of Manhattan. How many of you, we are in the room right, social justice activists, people of color ah... GLBT, other women all of various identities? How much... How many of you are from Columbia? Quite a few. So, don’t have to raise your hands, but just thinking about it. How many of you students and faculty know anything about Columbia University’s relationship to the local community? How many of you are involved in anyway? How many of you are involved in trying to foster positive relationships between Columbia and the university? We are in a very beautiful space. And yet the spaces around this university are not as well off, not as developed, the schools and community need more of the resources that a place like Columbia has. So, going back again to this idea of superficiality ah... and the idea that many organizations call us and to do diversity work and we are faced with that threat of superficiality. I can't think of how many times I’ve been asked to come in and do a workshop, a diversity workshop for our staff, right organization we'll call. Please do a diversity workshop. Okay. How long do you have? Ah... A day, half a day, well two hours. Could you come for two hours, right, and do some work on diversity? That is really ah... really social justice anorexia. Right? People do not want to engage at a deep level around issues of diversity and social justice. And so over the years, I have come to the point were those are the, the consultations that I turned down. On occasion, I will work with an institution or an organization that wants you to come and do a half a day workshop and you are there for a half day and they will build it in, so that every year or every six months, you are coming back to do a half day workshop for their staff, or they are letting you do a half day workshop on social class and next, and the next six months of the next year they are gonna have you come back and do a social justice workshop around race. So, some organizations do layer their work in that way. But we really need to be vary of those organizations (inaudible ) to do one short deals when you know at the beginning of the consultation or the training that there's no way that you can ever get to cover the kind of material that the organization needs to know in order to change. That’s the sign right there that they are not interested in change. Ah... I’m thinking of one kind of again breakthrough. One group of schools that I work with in the independent school sector, there is a consortium that I’ve consulted to, who for 30 years has continued to demonstrate excellence in diversity efforts. Ah... They've involved their faculty, their teachers, their students, their administrators in ongoing diversity work. That again is a rare and a precious opportunity to go in and do some long term work around diversity. I wanna talk about one particular challenge or one particular breakthrough ah... that I had with an organization ah... that I actually did a five-year diversity consultation with. Five-year diversity consultation. And in that five years, we were really able to again change the phase of that organization. And I wanna give you a few hints about that, again the ah... the leadership of a CEO or Senior Executive who says this is what we are going to do. In this particular case, I worked with this Regional Director of a large human service organization, 1200 staff ah... in the region and ah... he told me pretty soon into the consultation, "I don’t know how long I’m gonna be here, so let's get some things done". Right? And we began to develop a four-day module, for staff that we basically took almost three quarters of the staff through. Probably would have been everybody, but over the five years there was a big change in the workforce, constantly changing workforce. And we began with four solid days; one on cultural competence, very basic, knowledge. Who do you know? What do you know about various cultural groups? We moved that into a day long module on anti-bias training. What is bias? Right? How do we rid(ph) ourselves of bias? We've entered the next step and did another day on multicultural organizational development. So, with all staff members we had three days of work and with all managers and execs we did a ah... leadership day on multicultural organizational development, multicultural organizational change. That was one piece, just the educational piece. And this was one of the most exciting consultations that I ever had the opportunity to work with. Because while we were doing that training, we were looking at the organization in terms of inclusion and starting from the top, because in this organization as in many organizations, ah... people of color were replete at ah... "lowest levels", at the service levels. I don’t like that phrase lowest levels, at the service levels of the organization. But the leadership was all white. Many female, ah... some GLBT, one that I can think of but not out in that organization. And ah... what we did was begin to transform, recruit, so that in five area directors we were able to appoint two area directors or have appointed two area directors who were people of color. We developed mentoring groups across that organization. So that we had a mentoring group for people of color, we had a mentoring group for women, we had a mentoring group for GLBT staff trying to help people advance up the ladders of the organization. Right? And ah... talking about the common good, when we were pressed a little bit about what about me because this was the organization in which it was very hard to move up. You know, hard it was great to be at the service levels but the supervisory levels were, were a kind of packed and blocked. And so, what we did in that case was to develop an all staff mentoring group so that anybody had and everybody would have the opportunity to participate in organizational change. That’s an example of deep ah... diversity work. Diversity work that really is in depth. I had a another consultation with an independent school, very prestigious independent school in United States where we spent two years. Right? This is real social justice work. Right? Two years looking at academic achievement among black and Latino students, right, visiting classes, participating, ah... surveying staff, surveying students, developing focus groups, doing interviews, getting to know the staff members, developing a team from the organization that was to facilitate the change effort. Right? And in that year and a half, we came to very clear understandings of what was blocking the advancement of students of colour in that independent school and also what was advancing it. Right? What were the strengths and what were the limitations? I’ll tell you a little bit about that. Some of the limitations were faculty members who were dissuading students of color from taking high level courses. This is a kind of school were, you know if you ah... are taking calculus, they’ve got probably four levels of calculus that you might be able to take you know, high school with four level of calculus. And so when students of color and black and Latino students in particular that school also talk about breadth and depth was very involved in looking at the experience of the Haitian and Haitian-American students in their school and contracted with Professor Jean Woo to do that work for Haitian students. So, this was not just you know, a one shot deal or a one, self focus on black and Latino students, but we found that faculty members were dissuading students of color from taking those courses. That was one impediment. The students own anxieties was another impediment. And so we were able to use the office of diversity in that office ah... to ah... at that school to do more work in terms of encouraging ah... participation. Ah... Another encouragement, another success was that a African faculty member who taught chemistry brought students together to facilitate their learning in chemistry and in mathematics so that they could advance at the levels that they wanted to advance in the particular institution. And we came to see that this kind of consultation, this paying attention to the achievement of students of color black and Latino students in this particular case. Also, was a, kind of had that organizational highlight effect you know, when you pay attention then people start to perform, they step up their game. They begin to perform at many, many, much, much higher levels. And I’ll say two more things about that consultation. Another kind of breakthrough in our thinking was that we stopped defining. Ah... We stopped talking about or using the language of the achievement gap. We began to see that the language of the achievement gap really was a language that perpetuated exactly what it was supposed to ah... to turn around and supposed to ah... move. So, we began to talk about achievement and about what we learned and that particular school that consultation, almost a two-year consultation ended with a convening of the top independent schools in the northeast ah... to study achievement and the successes of achievement among students of color. So, again to do real diversity work, to breakthrough that level of superficiality that we see in our work to some real depth is what makes for a successful diversity consultation. I wanna talk about another threat. And that is the treat of exclusion. And I... You know, I really think that ah... as I think about these four threats that they really are a kind of increase in terms of their severity and importance. If you have a lack of knowledge or a lack of competence you can get information, right? You can find people who work with you if you have got the commitment and the interest, you can do that, right? Ah... Being superficial, again unless it's real resistance and that superficiality is a, or that shallow level of work on diversity is evidence of that kind of, excuse me, of that kind of resistance you can get deep in terms of diversity work and I’ve given you a couple of examples of how that’s happened. But I think there is another huge challenge and that is the threat of, of exclusion. And as much as we like to think so, ah... the threat of exclusion is still very prominent in our organizations today. Hardiman and Jackson’s work on multicultural organizational development and their model, they identified two early stages on the road to what they call a fully multicultural organization. One that in their terms is characterized by social justice and equity. The first stage is the exclusionary stage. And they say that in the exclusionary, in organizations that are at the exclusionary stage, ah... exclusion is part of their mission. Is not an accident. It’s what they exist to do and who they exist to be. Right? Is an exclusionary organization. And they name the KKK ah... as one example of that. Right? The KKK exist, Neo-Nazi organizations exist to keep others out. To perpetuate themselves. The next stage ah... that they talk about in a somewhat more positive direction, they characterize as the club stage of the organizational development. They say that in the club stage, exclusion is not part of their mission, but exclusion may indeed occur because the organization limits the participation of targeted groups women, GLBT folk, people of color etc. limits the participation of targeted folks. And when they do admit people from targeted groups or disenfranchised groups, those people are meant to stay in stereotypical positions. I don’t know, I’m in New York today and so I’m thinking about you know, some of the doormen in the, you know in the highest, you know, these very fancy high-rises, right, the top of the line and, yeah, they'll hire somebody, who is Latino, but that’s at the door. Right? Ah... So, we see a lot of that in organizations. Ah... I wanna talk about an example of exclusion, an example of absolute exclusion that recently occurred to me in an organization that I worked with. And ah... I wanna just say in advance that ah... after being a tenured faculty member and having taught in ah... several colleges and being in a visiting person, I... you know, I think I have some thing to offer an organization and I think I know some thing about organizations and about academia. Well, last year I began to teach in a free standing institution of higher learning for psychologists in Boston. One of those ah... institutions with no tenure and you know, one or two you know, one or two-year contracts. Ah... It was in the first year of a new program in this institution. And I tell you I come from Western Mass, they call it, in Western Mass we describe it as Happy Valley, you know we are all kinda look like a little Berkeley, little social justice oriented folks and I am from New York and I kept thinking I am going to Boston, I am going to Boston and there was something nagging in the back of my head, because I actually have done another consultation in Boston in which, which was really, really was in the Waltham area close to Boston which was rife with the most virulent ah... racism ah... that I've ever ah... experienced. And I think I'll say something about that organization in just a minute. Ah... But at this organization where I began, so it's a little bit nervous ah... but very excited about working in this new program in the first year of this program, all of the faculty members in this program were white, all were from the Boston area. All were Irish-American and all were colleagues and friends with a long history of relationship, right. In October, I asked a question, a question that for us ah... might be an important question to ask, and that question was, I wondered allowed why the women on the faculty, this four-person faculty changed their mind in, mind in the conversation when the only man on the faculty entered the conversation. In that context, it was a very impolitic question. And in October, immediately after asking this question, ah... became (inaudible ) a ah... landmark time for me at this organization, because after asking the question, I was immediately outside of the loop. And it happened in very profound, not at all subtle ways. As of November, all department faculty meetings seized to be. Could we imagine that, right, in a brand new program that was a one-year program and people have to graduate at the end. So, what that meant was they happened without me there. But as far as I was concerned ah... they seize to be. My request to sit down and talk together went unanswered and by the end of the year I had been effectively and totally isolated and excluded from the faculty of this program. Despite outstanding teaching evaluations from my students and despite or perhaps because, I was the only faculty member with significant publications, I was not invited back. My club experience at this institution was deepened by the awareness that one of only two students of color, one who is also an employee of the organization was also forced to quit, driven out by bias, denigration and micromanagement. Club organizations like this exist all over this country. It isn't unlikely that a diversity consultant would be asked to consult to, to one, but there might be. And to be sure if you or me or anybody like us was invited to come in, we would be asked to do very circumscribed things. And to look at very partial data and to interact at very, in very superficial ways. Sometimes an organization or program is not ready and when that happens, you may see a track record of either firing, although it's very rare these days that organizations have the, ah... I want to say the guts, but also the, hm... integrity, right, to let someone go ah... and give them good reasons why. They usually force people to quit ah... in many ways by excluding them, and the ultimate message is that we don't want you here, you don't belong here. And it's helpful for us as mental health professionals to understand that although people don't always say what they mean, they invariably do what they intend. So, don't follow the words, look at the practice. Our traditional schools of higher education have been said to create a chilly atmosphere for people of color and in some cases we have to ask ourselves is this inadvertent or is it intentional. Exclusion can happen in other ways. Ah... In some of our organizations and some organizations that I've consulted to, I've seen what I call the very narrow sense of we. Even in our social justice community. I have seen organizations where African-Americans, block the progress of Latinos and I've seen the reverse. I've seen organizations where Haitian-Americans are not considered part of us, part of the we. I've consulted to organizations, I'm thinking of one in particular where ah... the person who brought me in to consult on a diversity and social justice, the diversity project said we are talking to you about black staff in this organization, black and Latino staff in this organization, we, we said that's why we brought you in. But really, whispered, really, we really are more interested in the black staff, right. The black staff member right, black leader in the organization. So, even we have ah... sometimes exclusionary ideas about who community is, who our community is, where he asked you to, Dr. Miville asked you to think about who is your community? Even we sometimes have very narrow ideas about who is our community. If we're talking about justice, social justice and justice does not mean just us, right. It doesn't just mean me or my identity groups, right. It means all people who are targeted by racism, by bias, by class oppression, by gender oppression and so on. And it means beyond that to the common good. So, building a coalition in any organization that is inclusive is extremely important. I wanna talk to you for a moment about ah... a project I worked with in New York, a group I worked with in New York City, ah... where we developed this idea about getting to we. I went to consult to ah... an independent school where the parents were kind of at war with one another ah... about all kinds of issues, diversity being one, right. Ah... Who is diverse? What does it mean to diverse, be diverse? How diverse do we wanna be? Ah... How inclusive our, our, our events? Ah... Can you come to our events in this prestigious independent school if you have less money than others? Ah... And... But the, the character the quality of the conversation, all good questions, but the quality of the conversation was quite problematic. So, what we did, I kept thinking about ah... Rodger Fisher's work getting to we, and I thought, well if in this school the, the families and the faculty and if people could get to a sense of, this is our school right, this is what we want for all of our children, not just, you know that my group. So, what we did was that we developed a small ah... diversity microcosm group in the school. And we invited applications. And it was really a small group, 13 people. And we made it as diverse as you could possibly imagine in terms of race, ethnicity, language. In terms of family form, meaning, married families, divorced families, single-parent families, remarried families, adoptive families, right. And in terms of ah... sexual orientation, GLBT families and so on. But it was really a microcosm group. We had representatives. And our goal was to be able to talk about diversity and social justice issues in an equitable way that prioritize the needs of children in this school, because school exists for the purpose of children. In terms of their needs at the current time and in their future, what do children need. And the goal was simply to do good dialogue work, to be able to share in a way that ah... advanced the needs of children without creating the kinds of divisions and acrimony, right, that persisted in conversations in that school. And we were quite successful. Ah... We had a little push ah... to make the group bigger, make the group bigger, but you know knowing about small group process we really stuck to doing it, a 12-13-person microcosm group and we asked those groups to be emissary, those individuals to be emissaries to their identity and community groups throughout the school. And that intervention was so successful that ah... after the consultation, there own diversity worker ah... stayed and ah... continued that program for parents. Here is another ah... little hint about how ah... inclusive a social justice orientation is in an organization. I worked mostly in colleges and independent schools, so this is from, from that sector. Ah... Many of you know, if you work in private schools or in, in organizations, there is often a diversity director or a diversity coordinator. In some schools you will see ah... an office or an individual, whose title is something like, the director of multiculturalism and community or the director of or the dean of diversity and community. When you hear name like that you have an inclination or an indication that that organization is moving beyond diversity as a set aside entity, as something that does not involve the whole. Really breaking through to including diversity into the community, into the context of the whole school. When you... When you look at schools, think about that, when you see, look at that title diversity director, it will tell you a diversity coordinator, it will tell you a lot, about how much an organization is ready to get to we. You know we have interestingly this sort of funny phrase getting to we, which is kind of grammatically incorrect, we have new support ah... coming to us from the work of Dan Siegel, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist, who in his research and in his highly acclaimed book "Mindsight" has coined the phrase the neurobiology of we. Siegel suggests that we are tricked by our cerebral cortex into thinking that we are separate beings. Hmm... We're tricked by our cerebral cortex into thinking that we are separate beings. He asserts that we aren't. The mind can be defined. He defined the mind as an embodied and relational process that regulates the flow of energy and information and he goes on to say, we are connected with the other on the inside, not just on the outside, by the relational prosthesis of our mind. So from a narrative framework, let me, let me talk about far more from a narrative framework. We have been listening ah... to the stories of others all our lives. And in fact, storytelling is one of the constants throughout history and throughout time. All cultures and all peoples tell stories. So, think about who has told you stories, right. I think of my father's stories about Trinidad in the early 20th century, with blacks and whites colonizers, people from Great Britain because of still a colony, Indians from India, who are working then as indentured servants, think about those stories. Think about the stories you've heard in school, the George Washington story, right. I cannot tell a lie, all of those stories. Think about your own ethnic heritage, your personal heritage. Think about walking into an organization and what stories you are told when you became a student at Columbia, what's the history that's passed down to you, or at city, or you work at (inaudible ) college. What's... What are the stories that are passed down to you, about your unit, about the organization that you are a part of, about that entity? Once you hear those stories and you tell them to your children, to your mentees and to others, you have taken the other inside of you. The story that was told you about another time, another place another people, becomes part of your mental process, your mental map, your mental or interior landscape. And so, if we're talking about the neurobiology of we, whose stories are running through your mind, our minds and whose stories are missing? Because getting to we involves ah... developing those stories in a very full and positive way. The last threat I wanna talk about is the threat of isolation. Ah... In our ah... activism as social justice activist, in our ah... work as ah... students, as psychologists, we can often become isolated as a result of the exclusion that we experience. And that's where the lessons of this conference come into being, ah... that we want to learn to act together, to get the stories of all of us, ah... into the space, to build community, to not be content just with our knowledge, but really trying to get the knowledge of the whole. Isolation is one of the prime ah... mechanisms of those in power to disenfranchise those who do not, who have less power. And I... I don't wanna say, and I want to caution you as well, not to think or talk about the "powerless", right, or people who are powerless, because in fact none of us are powerless, right. I hear that a lot from my, my students. People in power and people who are powerless. Ah... I think I need help with the, the screen here, thank you. People who are powerless, we have no, none of us are powerless. And to suggest that any of us are powerless, really ah... creates what we're trying to avoid, it creates a sense of powerlessness. So, think about ah... blacks in the south prior to the civil rights ah... era. Ah... Think about ah... gay and lesbian people across the country who are moving the agenda ah... for marriage ah... against great opposition, ah... but making it happen in places like South Africa and Massachusetts, ah in other places, right. So, we are not, none of us is powerless. And... And I love it if everybody would remove that phrase ah... from their vocabulary. But we are, they... the powers that we attend to attempt to render us, render us powerless by isolating us. And as long as we can act together, ah... then we can remove the sense ah... of isolation. That kind of isolation came up for me in one organization that I worked with and for everyone in that organization. Ah... Some of you have ah... read the paper that Professor Miville mentioned about consulting for social justice, for diversity in social justice and I would just wanna say a little bit about that ah... that organization. Ah... In this particular organization, which was a human service organization, ah... my ah... facilitation at a meeting, was interrupted ah... by a psychologist who said to me, a staff psychologist who said to me, right staff psychologist; "Who do you think you are?" Just a diversity consultant you know. "Who do you think you are?" On another occasion, my facilitation at a meeting, I mean, you know, we, we do work that is in all of our context, clinical or organizational, ah... quite trying at times, ah... I'll just parenthetically say just three months ago, I had a ah... woman come into my office, I have a practice that specializes in ah... dealing with people who are elders, are elders and I got a referral from a physician and I was in my office and I opened the door to the waiting room and a lady, probably 75 ah... stepped back and said; "I didn't know you were black". Ah... Came into the office, had you know a sort of somewhat reasonable conversation in which she told me about her problems and ah... close to the end of the consultation, she said, ah... "I just want you to know, I didn't vote for Obama." Okay. So, we have trying moments. Ah... There was a funny moment because you know, if you can find a way to ah... place yourself on higher ground right, ah... then it doesn't hit you in quite the same way. I mean, this was somebody that I, I really felt sorry for ah... in many ways, because she was looking for some help and she needed some help and I did have the skills and the ability and even the willingness ah... to work with her but needless to say ah... she didn't come back. Ah... But this happens also in organizations. And in this organization where I was asked, who do you think you are? Ah... On another occasion my facilitation meeting was interrupted and I was blamed for the staff's intergroup conflict that you know, predated my coming there and this was such an acrimonious organization that ultimately all of my consultation records were subpoenaed by the courts in a union lawsuit against the organization and part of what the union was mad about, was that the organization was trying ah... to include and promote ah... people of color in an organization that had been predominantly white. But I was not the only person under attack in this consultation, Haitian immigrant staff members were also the target of demeaning treatment and physical threats. There were described by some managers as not caring about the patients, stealing from them and neglecting them. On the other hand, managers continued... maintained that they were colorblind. They didn't see color, they just saw that all of these just happened to be black-Haitian staff were doing everything wrong. When a Haitian staff member tried to give an example of the negative treatment he had received while employed at the agency, he was accused of being racist toward the white staff. In another meeting, by the way this was the other organization that I referred to as being in Waltham, there is something about that world up there, that's very different I think from New York City. In another meeting in which many Haitian staff members were present, a white clinician expressed his resentment at having to water down his psychological reports, so that they, they could be understood by staff members who first, whose first language was not English. He asked; Why do I have to water down my reports, so they can be understood by people with a third grade education?" He stressed the word water down and third grade education and in this meeting he angrily repeated this comment three times, repeated it, and repeated it, and repeated it, with the Haitian staff members he was referring to present. In one of those meetings, a Haitian woman took the floor, apologizing for her accent she said, that she wanted to say something, in the hope that we could understand her. She spoke about how she and her fellow co-workers often felt about their jobs as caretakers in this institution in halting heavily accented English, she told how they hated to come to work in the morning and how they were unable to speak for themselves, to speak up for themselves, for fear of retaliation in the, by their supervisors. This was a institution by the way in which the psychologists who were all white ah... were, would enter a building to do an assessment of a ah... resident. They would come to the doors as a residential treatment facility, they would come to the door and they would say, for example ah... "Where is Michael?" Michael being the patient resident that they wish to see. Ah... They would never speak to the staff person. You know, it wouldn't be I'm Pat Romney or even though I am Dr. Romney, good to meet you, who are you, right, I'm looking for Michael and so that didn't occur. Ah... In halting and heavily accented English she talked about hating to come to work in the morning. She said even in meetings when we are asked to talk, we cannot speak, we are afraid, we get sick. This not speaking makes us sick, because we much hold it inside, we cannot let it out. She spoke of how she and other direct care workers were ignored, like coming in and nobody speaking to them, you are treated like a chair or a table or a piece of furniture, they don't speak to you. You all looked down on, talked down to, she continued, those of us who has so small jobs are not respected by those who do big jobs. She whispered to me, even the Bible says, we should respect one another, even the Bible says this. Doing diversity work in this kind of setting is difficult. And you know I thought of the (inaudible ) ah... I've been scattered in pieces and I think this speaks to all of us, all of our experiences ah... as disenfranchised members of, of organizations. I've been scattered in pieces, torn by conflict, mocked by laughter, washed down in drink in alleyways, I sweep myself up out of garbage and broken glass. How do we respond to this for ourselves as consultants for our field ah... and for staff members that people with whom we work and whom we represent? A useful response is to seek first to understand, it may not feel like enough, but I think it's a good starting place. Ah... In this organization, the agency was moving belatedly to a deinstitutionalization which threatened everyone's jobs, particularly the psychologists. Masters level psychologists who had been with the agency for decades had good reason to fear that they would not be able to find new employment with comparable pay. So, I thought first to understand them. Although this kind of defensive and hostile behaviors is rarely so extreme in many organizations, strong resistance is not uncommon, when consulting about diversity. Another challenge that we sometimes confront when we confront, we're isolated and discriminated against in this way ah... and this is I think really important for students and other practitioners but students in particular. We begin to doubt our confidence. We begin to wonder if it's us, if we can move the organization forward. Thankfully at that time, I understood that one of the ways in which racism and sexism operate in my case is that they strive to deskill us, right, and to unnerve us as ah... who are the targets. There is a subtle way in which these factors operate in my work. Often in my consultation work, I am referred to as a diversity consultant rather than as a psychologist. I don't take issue with that directly, because it's not about titles and status, it is after all one of the issues on which I consult. Sometimes I specify that I am a clinician or an organizational psychologist. When I do, that identity reminds my clients that I have knowledge of human behavior and organizational behavior that compliments and extends beyond the ah... knowledge I have about diversity and social justice. Given that orientation, when the woman in the case described above demanded to know who I thought I was, I was able to tell her. In these encounters, although people tend to forget or underrate our credentials, it is important to have a good and clear sense of our professional identity, not an identity which ah... ah... places us above anyone else, but certainly in identity and credentials which make, makes us good and strong players on the field. This brings me to, what actually is my final point ah... in the threat area which is the threat of ah... isolation... ah... not isolation, but the threat or the challenge really of sustaining ourselves right, ah... to fight ah... the hopelessness that we often feel. Developing mentors both peer mentors and more senior mentors is key in that consultation that I just described. Ah... I actually was driving home one day ah... in tears and I remembered the ah... words of one of my mentors ah... Dr. Leroy Wells who, when I had a very difficult consultation years earlier had said to me; "Can you love them enough to help them learn". Right. "And you love them enough just enough ah... to help them learn". So, developing mentors is one way in which we can get beyond the hopelessness ah... to sustain ourselves, to breakthrough ah... to success in our fields. And those mentors should be of many kinds and types both inside our organization, inside our field, and outside our field. Manning... Maintaining a spiritual perspective for me ah... helps to sustain us. Attending programs like this cross-cultural roundtable, 27 years in it's longevity is part of what sustains us. That's why you see here ah... so many ah... new first-timers but also so many people who've been coming year after year after year. Ah... When I talked with people in, in Amherst where I live now about coming to this consultation, people said: "Oh, I always go to that consultation. That... That round table sustained me year after year in the work that I do". Coming together and sustaining ourselves, developing community so that we can act together ah... is crucial to us and it enlarges our sense of we. As a psychologist, if you are a psychologist and I know there are others here who are in other organizations whatever organization you are in, join the committees and the divisions that are part of your identity group, that committees and divisions that serve ah... social justice ends, committees like Division 45, Society for the Study of Ethnic Minority Issues, Division 34, Society for the Psychology of Women, Division 44, Society for the Study of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Issues, right. Ah... In fact Division 45 is having it's first conference ah... this year. Attend those conferences. So to summarize, I wanna say that in the work of consultation and in our work as therapists, ah... in our work in advancing, multicultural issues, social justice issues, we want to be inclusive right, we want to first of all ah... break through the threat of, of ignorance so that we can educate, so that we study, ah... so that we work ah... with others. We want to not rest in superficiality, but really foster depth in our work. And I just at difficult dialogues conference, ah... conference at Clark last weekend heard Liz Coleman, President of Bennington College speak about what she considers to be the first iconomy between depth and breadth, right. Just why is that we wanted the other, right? We can be deep in our work as social justice advocates and social justice agents and still be ah... broad and inclusive in that work. We want to challenge the threat of exclusion, ah... by expanding our sense of we, by making connections, building coalitions for support and justice. Naming in justice when we see it. Naming and identifying the clubs that exist in our atmosphere, not being silent or being silenced. We may have different ways of establishing voice, but we have, we much find, each find our own way to develop voice and make sure ah... that we have an impact. We also want to go beyond the threat of exhaustion and hopelessness to really build community. So that in the, in the words of this conference we can act together, ah... because ultimately we do have each other and we need to rely on each other and believe in that. Once again I just wanna say thank you. I am so pleased to be a participant at the Teacher's College round table. This has been over 27 years, an extraordinary learning and holding environment. And those of you sitting in the audience, those of us in the room ah... have used it as a, an aid in sustaining ourselves for many, many years. It's become a place where we can talk about myriad cultures. We can talk about being Jewish. I was looking at the, the papers that are going to be given over the next couple of days, the round tables we can talk about being Jewish, we can talk about being multiracial, we can affirm multicultural identity in research, we can talk about stigma, we can talk about mental health. We can talk about health disparities. Ah... We can talk about compassion fatigue and community sovereignty. This conference gives us that opportunity to breakthrough all the threats to a truly multicultural and just world. So I wanna thank you again for this invitation and for the profound opportunity ah... to be with you today. Thank you very much.
