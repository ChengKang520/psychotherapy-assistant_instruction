MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development Microtraining Associates, Inc. 888-505-5576 Email: info@emicrotraining.com Website: www.emicrotraining.com Microtraining Associates presents Overcoming Trauma: Altruism Born of Suffering Â©2009 Ervin Staub, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology, Emeritus University of Massachusetts interviewed by Norma Gluckstern Packard Chapter 1: Introduction 

00:00:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD  My name is Norma Gluckstern Packard and I'll be interviewing Dr. Ervin Staub about the impact of individual and group victimization and other suffering about the experiences that can lead them to become caring and helpful to others and how this could be facilitated by those of us who are teachers, counselors, therapist and other professionals. We all know that being a victim of violence can cause severe psychological consequences. These includes posttraumatic stress disorders, in the, inpar, individual having difficulty in their daily life and other mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. One person who has started to look at an important positive concept of vi, victimization is Dr. Ervin Staub. Through his writing particularly his book on The Roots of Evil which really discuss the origin of genocide and other group violence and his book on The Psychology of Good and Evil which talks about why children and adults in groups either harm or help each other. His interaction uhm, with victims of genocide particularly in Rwanda uh, his uh, work with people the way they've experience violence in their daily life and his own personal experience of having been a victim of a holocaust. He's developed a strong interest in a particular pho, phenomenon he calls Altruism Born of Suffering. He has been working on trying to identify the experiences that help can bring up, that can help us bring about Altruism Born of Suffering and how this can be promoted. It is now my pleasure to talk to you and ask you my first question. Could you tell us what Altruism Born of Suffering and how you became interested in that phenomenon? 

00:02:30
ERVIN STAUB Before I begin to study the origins of genocide and work on its prevention, for many years I have done research and writing on the origins of altruism, on helping behavior and want these people to help others. And at some point, the magazine Psychology Today ask me to develop a questionnaire for them on helping behavior and they published these questionnaire under the title of Values in Helping and more than 7,000 people returned the questionnaires. And I also asked people in the questionnaire that if they feel like it to write letters of, of their experiences and a number of people wrote letters in which they said because of the way I suffered, because of the pain that was inflicted on me in different settings I want to do everything that I can to prevent other people suffering and to help people who have suffered. And that began my interest specially because research on the roots of altruism has focused entirely on its positive roots. On how positive socialization, love and caring by parents, positive guidance, the example of good models leads children and people to become caring and helpful but here there were people who were saying I want to help others. I care about others because of the way I suffered. So then I begin to look it out and I saw that in case studies, in autobiographical books and reports people have been describing how they have suffered and how that moved them to care about other people. And so that was the beginning of my interest in what I call Altruism Born of Suffering. And what I mean by that is very simply that people who have suffered intensely, who have painful experiences specially through victimization, through harm inflicted on them by other people, how they become caring and helpful for the sake of other people. 

00:04:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Without running to another question I was gonna ask you but I think in some ways you've answered it, what are the usual consequences of victimization or the trauma in why is Altruism Born of Suffering important. 

00:05:00
ERVIN STAUB  Well, you said what are some of these consequences in your introduction. Uh, usually it involves pretty intense symptoms, people have focused on what they call posttraumatic stress disorder which involves uh, attempting to avoid thinking about the bad things that happened to you accompanied by intrusive imagery during the day, at night. Uh, it involves hyper vigilance, people are very intense looking at events around them because of their sense of nature. (crosstalk) 

00:05:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh-huh. 

00:05:45
ERVIN STAUB It can involve depression, it can involve anxiety, it can involve difficulty in functioning. Uh, but in other very important consequence is this that even when people don't have these symptoms and not everybody does. (crosstalk) 

00:06:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh-huh. 

00:06:05
ERVIN STAUB Not everybody who suffered or even was victimized has these symptoms. I believe and the research I think indicates that people come to feel very vulnerable. They feel diminished by what was done to them and in addition to that because it was human beings who have done bad things to them, we are primarily talking about victimization, uhm, they come to mistrust people. They see other people as dangerous and see the world as a dangerous place. So given all these when there is no threat to them, or when certain things happen they interpret that as threat and they react to that aggressively thinking that they need to defend themselves and so they use force, they use aggression even when that is not necessary. They engage in what maybe regarded as defensive violence. And all of that other kinds of violence evolves because people, when they engaged in violence they change, they can became more violent. So, one reason why this is so important is because uh, people suffer so much victimization in the wo, world, (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh-huh. 

00:07:25
ERVIN STAUB They have suffered so much harm and if these process takes place in many people we will have more and more violence in the world. So it becomes very important to understand how the impact of harm imposed on people whether individuals or members of a group can be transformed so that they become caring, they turn towards rather than against people and they contribute to the creation of a more peaceful world and a harmonious community. 

00:08:00
Chapter 2: Violence and Resilience 

00:08:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD  People in the trauma field have been interested in resilience and in more recent time post traumatic growth. Is Altruism Born of Suffering an example of these? 

00:08:15
ERVIN STAUB Now, my interest in and motivation to study this has been different. Uh, it, you know, I was concern with how many people are harmed about genocides in different places, mass killings in many places, all the suffering and how this is going to generate more and more violence. So my concern has been with the limiting of violence, the development of caring, understanding more a, about another way how altruism can develop. However, there are clear connections between research and resilience and post traumatic growth and Altruism Born of Suffering. Uh, first of all people who have studied resilience have focused on effective functioning in spite of very adverse experiences. So their focus is not on caring, helping and altruism but they have mentioned altruism as one possible aspect of a person functioning in a resilient way. So again altruism is not the defining characteristic of resilience but can be an aspect of resilience. I think that it can be an aspect of resilience specially when people who have suffered have some of the additional experiences that I will talk about. Now, those concern with altruism have looked at both the characteristics of individuals that helped them not be so severely impacted by adverse experiences and therefore be able to function in a resilient way. And also about certain kinds of experiences that enable people to be resilient. These experiences are some of the same experiences that I will talk about as promoting Altruism Born of Suffering but I think that, that our additional experiences that are important for Altruism Born of Suffering to development. The experiences that people who studied the resilience have talked about in the caring and supporting family uh, and also caring and supporting strangers, other people, teachers, adults, people out in the world, you know, somebody who was talking about helping children become resilient by getting them together to play soccer together in a regular way. A caring adult, connection to other kids uh, uhm, big brother and big sister programs contribute to resilience and they may also have with Altruism Born, born of Suffering that is I said additional experiences are also important. When you look at post traumatic growth, people have talked about empathy and altruism... (crosstalk) 

00:11:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh hmm. 

00:11:25
ERVIN STAUB ...as s-spots of post, post traumatic growth but they haven't studied the behavior. They have focused primarily on people's thinking. (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Thinking what? 

00:11:35
ERVIN STAUB  Cognitions. (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:11:40
ERVIN STAUB You know, when people have studied trauma, one of the things that they have talked about is disrupted schemes. Uh, understanding of the world changes rather than single world, the world as benevolent. People come to see the world as less benevolent to a malevolent. Uhm, and other kinds of schemes change. Perceptions of the self as I talked about change and they have been focusing on certain kinds of cognitions related to self, related to relationships, related to vision of the world uhm, as important aspects of post traumatic growth. (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh hmm. 

00:12:20
ERVIN STAUB  And those maybe important aspects also of Altruism Born of Suffering so there is an overlap but my focus is on behavior and my focus is primarily on experiences that promote it. 

00:12:40
Post Traumatic Growth through Changing Cognition 

00:12:40
ERVIN STAUB Here again people who studied post traumatic growth are talking about the kinds of personal characteristics of individuals that make people assess or interpret that experience. Not necessarily at the time maybe even overtime to reassess it in such a way that there will be this growth change in cognition. Now, there is also, this is a relatively new area even though it has gotten a lot of attention and there is some new research. For example, uh, Israel is in Palestinians at the type of, at the time of the intifadah, the revolt by Palestinians. Uh, and the violence at the time and people's responses into what extent they show post traumatic growth. And uh, what people have found in this research is that post traumatic growth was associated with high PTSD. (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD With what? 

00:13:45
ERVIN STAUB High posttraumatic stress response. (crosstalk) 

00:13:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh-huh. Alright. 

00:13:50
ERVIN STAUB So what does that mean that people who show post traumatic growth, these positive changes in cognition, in thinking also show high trauma responses. And these people also found that post traumatic growth was associated with ethnocentrism, a focus on one's own group and hostility toward other groups. Well, is post traumatic growth a defensive reaction sometimes and is it possible that perhaps it was only under these special circumstances where there was still on-going danger that post traumatic growth is associated with heightened trauma responses. So, what I'm saying is that this is an open area where we have to learn a lot of other things but there is overlap and there is difference in the we, I and my associates are focusing on altruistic behavior. 

00:14:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Let me, I would say, is it more that your involvement in behavior as suppose to how my cognition is? 

00:15:00
ERVIN STAUB Yes. 

00:15:00
Post Traumatic Growth through Behavior 

00:15:00
ERVIN STAUB Yes. Yes, we are interested on the line thinking that we are focusing on behavior (crosstalk) 

00:15:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD On behavior. 

00:15:05
ERVIN STAUB And try to understand what kind of underlying thinking has to change to create caring and helpful behavior and also that we are very interested in what are the experiences that promote it. 

00:15:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Can the behavior change and then the cognition change or do they have to be going simultaneously? Can I change my cognition or I don't, I can start the behavior and that will change my cognition? 

00:15:30
ERVIN STAUB  Well, these things can go either way but I think that in order for people to become altruistic in their behavior, (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh hmm. 

00:15:45
ERVIN STAUB  if they have suffered a great deal, first they have to have certain experiences that create certain changes in them. 

00:16:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Alright. Okay. 

00:16:00
ERVIN STAUB Then, once they begin to act in a helpful way, afterwards that is going to change them more and will create these changes in their thinking and feeling and orientations to a greater extent. (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Well, that's very important. 

00:16:15
ERVIN STAUB  So it is si, (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Okay. 

00:16:20
ERVIN STAUB It is a progressive evolution, one thing leading to another... (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Right. 

00:16:25
ERVIN STAUB ...that leading back and it evolves progressively. 

00:16:30
Chapter 3: Experiences Which Lead to Altruism Born of Suffering 

00:16:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD  Could you tell us about, some of the experiences that would make one uh, altruism behavior happened? (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
ERVIN STAUB Okay. 

00:16:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Suffering, altruism behavior. 

00:16:40
ERVIN STAUB Alright. Well, some of these experiences involve things that happen at the time of suffer. (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Hmm. 

00:16:55
ERVIN STAUB I believe and we actually have done some research that suggest that this is wrong and there is some other research that when people are helped at the time of their victimization, when they help at the time that people are doing the bad things to them or also at the time of other kinds of suffering they are, that contributes to Altruism Born of Suffering. Now, shall I just elaborate on each one of these or shall I list them first? (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD No, no. Maybe you can iden, maybe whatever, either identify some specifically that you might know of what, what I'll let, I'll leave it to your judgment. It would be nice if you could identify for some of us. Some specific cases or... (crosstalk) 

00:17:50
ERVIN STAUB Okay. Alright. Well, so for example being helped at the time of uhm, suffering uhm, survivors of the holocaust in Israel have been compo, participate in peace groups and work to promote more positive relations with Palestinians motivated apparently to a substantial extent by their concern for the welfare of the Palestinians. They have, the, a group of these people has been interviewed and compared to a group of survivors who are not part of such peace groups and the survivors who are part of the peace groups tend to report that they were helped at the time during the holocaust. So for example one young woman who was trying to escape with her mother and her siblings and go from the German side of Poland to the Russian side of Poland were stopped by German soldiers. And these German soldiers after some discussion let them go and proceed on to the other side. So clearly they received significant help. Uhm, there are cases in which uhm, that people have described uh, under the heading of resilience but I think that in these cases people also have these additional experiences where a young woman for example, a young girl is very harshly treated again and again and severely beaten by her mother and uhm, so are her siblings. And there is an aunt that comes to visit some of the time and is kind to her. And actually this comes under another heading but uh, the other heading is people showing caring (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh hmm. 

00:19:55
ERVIN STAUB And concern about somebody. 

00:19:55
Suffering that leads to Altruism 

00:19:55
ERVIN STAUB  Uh, we did a study with college students in which we compared people who said that they suffered from harsh treatment in their families, they suffered from persecution and violence as members of her group, they suffered as a result of some natural disaster or they have not suffered. To our surprise all of the people who have describe themselves having suffered and being harmed in the past showed greater concern, felt more empathy, and felt more of a feeling of personal responsibility for the victims of the tsunami. This happened right after the tsunami. (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Where is this? Uh, interesting. 

00:20:55
ERVIN STAUB  And in addition to that they also volunteer more to be part of a group that ties to that friends together to help the victims of the tsunami. Now, this was a little bit all(ph) surprise because we thought that it was going to be only some of the people who have suffered, who had some additional special experiences but we found that as a group, as a whole when we compared people who said they have suffered these ways or said they have not suffered, those who said they suffered were more concern, more empathic, felt more responsible, and were more willing to help. 

00:21:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD  And very, very interesting. I think that I have mentioned, I think you've done, I think you've address the issue of what can promote altruism of suffering or do, would you like to add some more of it 'cause (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
ERVIN STAUB Right. Well, actually the reason I was talking about this example is because among these people those who said that at the time of their suffering, they were helped by someone (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD They were helped? 

00:22:05
ERVIN STAUB They were more caring and more helpful. So while on the whole they have more, those who received help have specially more. Now, another example of these characteristics is people having able to help themselves. This was true for example on the peace activist in Israel. Those who were peace activist and compared to those who were not reported more often that they were able to take action that helped themselves or helped other people in their families uh, to survive. So people helping themselves at the time is important and valuable. Now, when people receive help from other people it to some degree balance this out. The terrible and violent behavior against... (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Everything. 

00:23:05
ERVIN STAUB In the face of all that violence against them people see, think, this can happen to me again and the world is a terrible place and people are terrible. But when somebody helps them and sometimes people are helped by others who endanger themselves to help them. (crosstalk) 

00:23:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Right. 

00:23:25
ERVIN STAUB That gives them a sense of a different possibility in the world. In some ways it redeems in their eyes the world and human beings. 

00:23:40
Chapter 4: Supportive Interventions 

00:23:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD  Uh, in the (inaudible ) I mentioned about one of the things that sometimes people turned out aggressive as a result of what happened. Could it be said that these people never, who are aggressive have never been, no one has ever help them or can somehow their personalities are different. How does that, how, how does that person who's been a victim within goes on victimizing people. Is that different or? 

00:24:10
ERVIN STAUB Well, again, they may not have had some of these experiences (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Yes, I, I was gonna ask like that. 

00:24:15
ERVIN STAUB Like you know, other experiences that are really important are caring and support by other people afterwards. (crosstalk) 

00:24:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Okay. 

00:24:25
ERVIN STAUB So you can, you won't have during but people reach out to you in a loving and caring and affectinate way afterwards and that can happen in so many different ways, you know, uhm, a, a counselor uh, in a summer camp seeing a child and knowing that this child has been victimized in some way and he's suffering and reaching out to that person. You know that's what therapist do also but it doesn't have to be therapist only. (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD That's what's very important to say that and it doesn't have to be just therapist. 

00:24:55
ERVIN STAUB Yeah, I mean, you know, we're working on Rwanda in trying to promote healing and psychological (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh hmm. 

00:25:05
ERVIN STAUB Recovery after the terror, terrible genocide there and also uhm, trying to promote reconciliation. And we have done this in seminars and workshops, in training facilitators who work with groups in the community and after a number of years we have been doing it in educational radio programs. And these educational period of programs trying to help people understand first of all what's the impact of violence on them, how they're affected and second how they can help each other. And something- 

00:25:45
Empathic Listening 

00:25:45
ERVIN STAUB -as simple as empathetically(ph) listening to another person is so helpful and these can be done not only by therapist but also by people in the community who when one person begins to talk about what happened to them are able to open themselves and listen empathetically(ph). And actually one of the things that professionals can do, the therapist can do, even teachers can do is to help people understand that they can do this each other and be opened to another person and that's not easy because often we are powerless in terms of doing anything to help that person. So given that we are powerless, it's too painful to listen sometimes but if we learn to just be present and to understand that our empathy can be healing to another person, that can make a very great difference. So caring, support, love and connections, all of these things can balance into some degree contract to psychological impact of the harmful behavior that people have suffered. 

00:27:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Hmm, and sometimes I feel people say allow people to speak about the unspeakable and if I can listen to you, I may be helping you if I say nothing but allowing you to feel comfortable and just speaking to me. That, that is a very important aspect that any of us can do uh, it, uh, it, when we come which, which I think came the question I was gonna ask you about how can somebody like myself who does not experience violence be of help to somebody who has been exposed. Who has been a victim of violence. 

00:27:45
ERVIN STAUB Well, you just tell them about some of these things.(crosstalk) 

00:27:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Yeah, yeah. Right. 

00:27:50
Victim offering to support 

00:27:50
ERVIN STAUB One is uh, uh, just empathic listening. (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Listening. 

00:27:50
ERVIN STAUB  Letting people tell their stories. And other is offering care and support in other ways. Uh, offering love and connections. Being a caring person. That tells this person that the world doesn't have to be the way it was when some people inflicted harm on him or her. Uhm, another interesting thing is, you know, one of the things when people have changed to some extent already. When they begin to see themselves as stronger and when they begin to see other people in more positive light and then they maybe ready to help others. To allow oneself to be helped. (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Oh. 

00:28:35
ERVIN STAUB By other person. You can help somebody, you can have them heal more, you can help get stronger, you can help them develop a feeling of effectiveness, you can help them to begin to see themselves as a helping person by allowing yourself to be helped. 

00:28:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD The, interesting concept. 

00:29:00
ERVIN STAUB So, in a way opening up and not loading one's need on this person but acknowledging and giving that person the power so that the relationship is not just if we are not talking about the therapist and the client but in relate, we are talking about professional (inaudible ) and people in general. The relationship is not just one way, I am helping you here and you need help but it's a human relationship in which I care, I love, I give you support, and I can receive care and support from you too. 

00:29:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Come on, as you talk one, one question that comes to my mind is that some people don't wanna speak or talk because they were ashamed. Is that something that you dealt with or ashamed to talk about what happened to them? Really, is that a feeling of shame? Blaming themselves. 

00:29:55
ERVIN STAUB You know, I core principle of my co-worker in Rwanda Laurie Anne Pearlman who is a trauma specialist is that people have to be in control of the story they tell. You cannot demand from that they tell their story. You cannot impose the need on them. You can facilitate it, you can be open to, you can be interested, you can engage in other ways and the story arises but they have to be in control. So really you are a facilitator. You are not a demander. (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD  Alright. 

00:30:45
ERVIN STAUB I am talking not about you. I am talking about all of us. 

00:30:45
Chapter 5: Understanding the Perpetrator: Reconciliation 

00:30:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD  That was one thing that I've become aware of that there is this feeling of shame that (crosstalk) 

00:31:00
ERVIN STAUB Yeah. 

00:31:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD I don't wanna, I really didn't know what happened to them. 

00:31:00
What leads to Violence 

00:31:00
ERVIN STAUB Well, there are certain things that can help people open up I think and one of those things can be a really important thing that we have been working in with, in Rwanda and I think is applicable everywhere. And that is helping people understand to the influences that have led the perpetrators, the people who have harmed them to their actions. Uh, in doing work in Rwanda whether it is seminars, training facilitators, working with national leaders or, or educational radio programs. We try to help people understand how genocide, violence by one groups against another group comes revolt. What are the influences at work? What are the conditions, the culture, the social conditions, difficult conditions of life, social confusion, chaos and so on that lead people to begin on the road to perpetration of extreme violence. And this has very powerful effects. Uh, we have done systematic research to evaluate the effects of this not on the people we trained but on these people working with community groups that we set up. And the impact of these work on the members of these community groups. People on the hillsides, in the villages. Hooties and Tootsies, both members of the two groups. Uhm, and we have it, we compare this to what happens in other groups led by people we have not trained. Various control groups and what we have found is that there is a reduction, trauma symptoms... (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Hmm. 

00:32:50
ERVIN STAUB ...than people are led by facilitators we trained and also there is what I call readiness to reconcile which includes a more positive orientation towards members of the other group and also what we call conditional forgiveness. And a more complex understanding of the origins of genocide. Now, when we work with this and tell people how genocide originates, we don't tell them this is how your genocide originated. We give examples from other places. And then we asked them to apply this to their own life because you cannot have people, you cannot inflict on people an explanation of that experience. You can facilitate them to develop a useful explanation and so we do this and then they apply when we work with them very effectively and wonderfully. But in addition to this formal evaluation when we do this work people say all kinds of things like oh, so the genocide wasn't God's punishment. Oh, this happened to other human beings also. So we are not unlike other people. Oh, if this is understandable and we know what brings it about we can take action to prevent it. So it contributes to healing. (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh-huh, as you were saying. 

00:34:20
ERVIN STAUB It opens people up a little bit to members of the other group including opens of victims to perpetrators so they are, they, they, see them in a somewhat less negative, maybe more positive life and I think by extension they come to see human beings in general in a more positive light and it also gives them a sense of importance(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Yes. 

00:34:45
ERVIN STAUB And that's also very important. So this understanding of the influences that led a perpetrator or perpetrators to that action I think is very important. 

00:34:55
The Humanization of Violence 

00:34:55
ERVIN STAUB There are care histories that describe this. Uh, you know, again O'Connor Higgins(ph) describes the case of a man who was extremely badly treated very early in childhood. His father beat him all the time, his mother gave him animus uh, to purify him uh, he, he had a really tough childhood and later on he begin to explore and think about why his father might have treated him that way. And his father's mother died early and his grandfather was a very hard working man who was, he welded all kind of things and he imagined his father as a young child, as a baby really standing in his crib screaming and nobody paying attention to him and this begin to shift a little bit. His attitude towards his father. So what I am saying is that understanding the perpetrator and the origins of the perpetrator's actions can help people whether it is individual violence in their family, bad treatment in any setting including genocide. 

00:36:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Right. Reconcile, reconciliation needs compassion to the per, for the perpetrator. It, it doesn't matter whether we're talking about Rwanda or talking about an experience that I've had as a child with my parents... (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
ERVIN STAUB Right. 

00:36:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD ...is what you're saying. 

00:36:25
ERVIN STAUB But you know, a, another thing is that this reconciliation, it doesn't have to be a complete reconciliation. (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD  Probably never is. 

00:36:35
ERVIN STAUB And sometimes you cannot reconcile with perpetrators because first of all they may not there anymore another, and, and sometimes they won't acknowledge anything that they have done so I am talking about first of all understanding which is a way station towards more positive attitudes and to some conditions away that station to forgiveness but even if it doesn't lead to forgiveness and reconciliation are wholly, it changes some of the underlying attitudes towards perpetrators and people that can lead to violence and revenge and opens ups the possibility towards, movement towards caring. 

00:37:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD That is the, that it's really very important that they can maybe prevent the, more violence in the part of the victim even though they cannot be forgiving. 

00:37:30
ERVIN STAUB Exactly. 

00:37:30
Chapter 6: The Role of the Bystander 

00:37:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD  The, one of the things that are, in your writings that I've been aware of is you talked about uh, the bystander that uh, have you, or is there something that you'd like add to what we're talking about but I know we had talked about the bystander. (coughs) What the role of the bystander would be? 

00:37:50
ERVIN STAUB Yeah. Well, you know (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD By the way I like your word bystanders, (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
ERVIN STAUB Yeah. 

00:37:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Bystandership. 

00:37:55
ERVIN STAUB Yeah. Well, let me tell you what I mean by that. Uh, we are all witnesses to many events around us. We are witnesses to people being harmed a lot of the time. You know, people in families often know it a little bit that something is happening. Now, bystanders are people who are in a position to know something that's happening in a position to take action and they can remain act passive or they can become active. Why do I say in a position to know? I say in a position to know because often people who are in that position turned their heads away... (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh hmm. 

00:38:45
ERVIN STAUB ...and try not to know. I did many studies many years ago on the States of Cambridge, Massachusetts where I had, I was at Harvard at the time and I had a young Harvard man collapsed on the street when somebody was coming from about 50 yards away in that direction. And they collapsed for various reasons holding their heart, holding their knees on the same side of the streets or the other side of the street. I was trying to understand what leads people to be active, what leads people to remain impassive and one of the very impressive and rather shocking thing that happened was that sometimes when this person was approaching and saw somebody on the other side of the street immediately after one look and seeing that person collapse this person would go across the street and ask what can I do, what's happening. And sometimes the person would come by and after one glace would look away, never look back and go away in the other direction. People sometimes try to avoid information so that they don't feel the obligation to act. I believe this happens in families. It happens when one person badly treats a child and sometimes relatives try not to look because it's too difficult and complicated to get involved. It happens when nations get harmed. You know, there was a lot of information coming out of Rwanda that bad violence is likely to happen and people ignored it completely. And then they try to get out of it even when the violence is happening by calling it on genocide, by giving it other names and so on. So the first step is we need to inform ourselves. They need to allow the information to come into us and that's very important. Then, when bad things happened we are in a position to take action. Now, what kind of action? Well, we can't action to prevent violence and sometimes that's not possible and we don't do it, you don't have the power to do it, the circumstance to do it. But we also have the potential to try to help somebody who is being harmed in certain ways. I was describing who I think that that is a very important part of people rather than turning against others turning towards others and becoming altruist that they were helped at the time. So, bystanders, witnesses can try to be helpful and take action or afterwards if you know that something happened to a person you can reach out to that person and, you know, people who talk about resilience and describe temperamental characteristics as one source of resilience, odd going children, temperamentally active children seem to have a better chance to be resilient, to function well in spite of adversity. Well, one part of this I think is that their temperamental protects them (crosstalk) 

00:42:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Hmm. 

00:42:15
ERVIN STAUB But I have, I think that another part of it maybe that these children attract more interest from other people so bystanders maybe more likely to reach out to them and be caring and supportive. I think though that being aware of everything that I'm talking about, it is important for bystanders, for people in the community, for everybody to also reach out to people who have suffered who may not have these more attractive temperamental characteristics. And in fact one of the consequences of suffering and victimization is to pull back, to withdraw. (crosstalk) 

00:43:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh hmm. I think you just talked about that earlier.(crosstalk) 

00:43:05
ERVIN STAUB Right. And so when we see that, that can be a signal that this child or this person needs others to reach out to them. 

00:43:15
The Active role of the Bystander in Our Schools 

00:43:15
ERVIN STAUB I, I think that everyone of us including children if they are guided in a positive way. Children in the classroom or teacher, counselors, professionals of all kinds, therapist and counselors, human beings can do all of these things that I was talking, that I have been talking about. They can help people heal. They can provide help and support at the time of some of this victimization or harmful actions against them. They can also try to act to prevent this things uhm, even can empower people and help to empower people to help themselves. I am working with a local community group here and we have develop a training and active bystandership for children. Uh, we trained each (inaudible ) creators and police officers from their communities to then train other children. And last year we trained 600 kids and we are now evaluating the effects of this with control groups and we are going to go on to train more kids. 

00:44:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD You're, you're training them for, to what? Could you be a little bit clear what are you training? (crosstalk) 

00:44:50
ERVIN STAUB What? 

00:44:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD What are you training in? 

00:44:50
ERVIN STAUB Well, we are training them to be active bystanders when they see harmful behavior by their peers against other peers. (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Oh. Well, some people call it bullying. 

00:45:00
Defining Bullying 

00:45:00
ERVIN STAUB Well, it's bullying but it's a broad range of things. It's, you know, it's, it's uh, a verbal abuse, it's a harming somebody else's property, it's a physical harm, it's all kinds of things and we train them to be positive bystanders. To engage in constructive ways if necessary to turn to other people and gain, analyze, to define the situation in such a way that other kids rather than joining a harm doer withdrawing together and try to stop it partly by saying to the harm doer, "No, this is not right." Partly by turning to the target as we call it and supporting the target and providing, you know, interest and showing that what, the other person was doing is not right and so on. So in all kids of ways we are trying to make it less likely (coughing) that victimization happens which is one of the things that bystander, bystanders can do. (crosstalk) 

00:46:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD That can do. 

00:46:15
ERVIN STAUB And we also talk to these kids about the generalization of this into that larger world which is complicated because some of them live under circumstances when they cannot easily be active bystanders without endangering themselves and at other times they can be other circum, circumstances when they can do very positive things as active bystanders. So we are working with them on that also. Now this is something that everybody can do in any circumstance in the office, in a, the military, in uh, in police officers. I, I once, after the Rodney King incident with police officers in California. Actually not with police officers directly. I was developing a training for police training institutions... (crosstalk) 

00:47:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh-huh. 

00:47:05
ERVIN STAUB ...to train police officers to be active bystanders to each other. To try to reshape their usual conception that whatever one police officer does, the other officer supports this officer to instead think of positive, active bystandership as good teamwork so that when one police officer begins to engage with a civilian in an increasingly harsh way, that's likely to lead to violence then the other officer engages it, with it in a constructive and positive way. So again, one of the things that all of us can do is to be thoughtful, constructive, positive bystanders to try to prevent the violence, to try to support the people when harm is inflicted on them, who show care and support and interest afterwards, who try to help people understand why other people may have active and negative ways towards them. Uh, who do all these things. Another thing that people can do is to be, this is another contributor to Altruism Born of Suffering is when people have altruistic models and positive guides towards altruism... (crosstalk) 

00:48:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh hmm. 

00:48:25
ERVIN STAUB  so uhm, again that can be done at all kinds of times. By the way, some of these things that I'm talking about, you know, can happen not only after violence has taken but it is after people were harmed or after they suffered in other ways. I'm focusing and emphasizing victimization because that's the most difficult. That's what's most likely to lead people to violence against others but it's not only victimization it's also other kind of trauma. Uhm, another thing that is really important is that doing many of these things just in general has a protective function. If children and adults are in caring and supportive relationships, if they learn to talk about painful experiences, if they understand in general ways why people do harmful things so that if it happens to them they can apply it to their own experience. If they learn in constructive ways to take effective action in their own behalf when that is possible and so on all of these things are likely to be protective also and diminish lesson, the harmful impact of victimization at the hands of other human beings. 

00:50:05
Chapter 7: War and Violence: Its Impact on the Warrior 

00:50:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD  Uh, I think of what is going on today in, with our soldiers coming back. Men and women who are suffering from posttraumatic stress disorders and depression. What can we do to help them in terms of how does Altruism Born of Suffering help in a very applied way today? To our own victim, to our soldiers and that are becoming victims of violence and either they've done, they've been the perpetrators or they have experience violence... (crosstalk) 

00:50:40
ERVIN STAUB Yeah. 

00:50:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD ...and victimization. 

00:50:40
The Soldier as a Perpetrator 

00:50:40
ERVIN STAUB Well, you know, one of the things about uh, everything that I have learned about genocide and violence between groups is that perpetrators are also wounded. Uhm, sometimes they become perpetrators because they have been wounded. You know, one of, you know, I was talking about defensive violence and I think I mentioned that one of the contributors to genocide is that a whole group of people has previously been victimized and now they see the world as dangerous, and they react defensively. They think and evolve, violence evolves and they become perpetrators on great violence. But in addition to that past of victimization when people engaged in violence, when they harm others to a very great extent that has a traumatizing and wounding effect on them. I don't think it is possible to do great harm to other people without at the very reason closing off, shutting off empathy, becoming more rigid as a self and as a person and being affective in a whole variety of negative ways including other ways. It can result in traumatic consequences like post traumatic stress disorder because what you have done can become an intrusive imagery and so on. Once you have harmed other people, the world seems more dangerous. So you need to be self protective. Uhm, so uhm, after Vietnam War for example, we did what was likely to wound Vietnam veterans even more. You know, some Vietnam veterans were wounded because they participated in killing to an extensive extent. Others were wounded because given the conditions of war and particularly Vietnam at the time they participated in atrocities. They killed civilians, they did terrible things to people, are necessary terrible things and that is very wounding but even those who didn't do any of those things, who were just fighting the war that they were sent to fight were likely to have been wounded specially given the nature of the conflict, and the nature of the fighting there. So when they come back and according to what I'm talking about, they need support, they need care, they need connection, they need the opportunity to heal and partly healing happens through connection to other people, partly healing happens through understanding the origins of violence and instead they are blamed for what the country has done. For having been sent to Vietnam and having fought in Vietnam. And they were very unwelcome. So I think that that is additional wound and we are now in Iraq. Uhm, this is likely to be very wounding for soldiers fighting there. (crosstalk) 

00:54:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh huh. 

00:54:15
ERVIN STAUB  Uhm, the nature of the war, the kind of war. Here also our forces engaging some atrocities uhm, unfortunately as war goes on that seems to happen uh, in addition to that they are sent on a number of tours of duty and the longer you are under the circumstances is the more likely that you are affected by them. So they are going to come back quite wounded. Now, the climate at this time when we are talking, you and I (crosstalk) 

00:54:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh hmm. 

00:54:55
ERVIN STAUB Is not like at the time of the Vietnam War and that is people more and more strongly disapprove of the war but they are not blaming the soldiers. And so they are more likely to receive care and support that they... (crosstalk) 

00:55:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uh hmm. 

00:55:15
ERVIN STAUB ...need to and you know one of the things that they are not likely to get is the unnaturally. Is an understanding of ourselves. We all need this as a country because to some extent we are all wounded by the war in Iraq and understanding for ourselves and why we do these things? Why we, do we go again and again, and engage in violence against others? What's the source of that? How can we understand ourselves? Self understanding is extremely important and when I talk about understanding the origins of violence I think that people who engage in violence very usefully, very importantly need to understand themselves. You know, why are we engaging in violence because that is healing that changes the orientation, that makes it less likely that we do it again later on and so this becomes a very important for the soldiers and it become, it is very important for the country. 

00:56:25
Chapter 8: Social Action: Interventions for Change 

00:56:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD  Are you optimistic of the impact of, if I, I know that you were involved in uh, establishing with the Psychology Department. Uh, something that I become more social justice. Uh, what is the uhm, likelihood that these profession counselor, therapist, psychologist will take on Altruism Born of Suffering as, as something that, that has to be, has to be trained, that people have to learn about? Are we going to be more involved in our cognitive, cognition rather than our behavior? 

00:57:10
ERVIN STAUB  Well, I think my experience with this concept so far which is relatively new. (crosstalk) 

00:57:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Very much. So that's why I'm asking this question. 

00:57:20
ERVIN STAUB Yeah. That it evokes such interest... (crosstalk) 

00:57:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Oh. (crosstalk) 

00:57:25
ERVIN STAUB ...that it is likely to gain, hold pretty strongly. You know we are doing work on it, we are developing articles, publishing on it, I have done already some writing about this uhm, and I, I think that is going to gain hold. Now, so the concept is likely to gain hold overtime that interventions that are implied what I'm talking about, interventions than any place including schools that can happen. You know, one of the interventions can for example for people coming together in groups and writing about their, writing about various things and then moving on more and more to write about their own experiences. Now, even in schools one can start talking have, having children write about stories that they read. Stories of other people's painful experience and write about them and then move on to more writing their own experience and move on to people reading to each other about what they wrote with certain ground rules which is that any comment to the other person's writing has to be positive. People have done writing groups like this in the community. For example in general but also in the disadvantage women with very positive effects. 

00:59:00
Writing as an Intervention for Change 

00:59:00
ERVIN STAUB Also there is research on by Penny Baker(ph) on how writing or talking for a short time about once experience can have very positive effects. So this kind of thing can be done. Many kinds of interventions can be done. Now, if this is done in schools it has to be done for one thing in a limited extent. Of course we don't want to turn schools into therap, purely therapeutic environments and also teachers have to learn how to trained and how to engage with children when painful experiences emerges. But to some degree it can be count on even in that setting and it can certainly be done in many other setting with adults. All kinds of ways. You know, you are asking about optimism. I'm optimistic about the concept. I'm uh, even optimistic about training. Am I optimistic about the using violence in world? That's the big question. 

01:00:05
Chapter 9: Empowering the Individual and Restorative Justice 

01:00:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD  As I listen you talk early so many of us just like myself focus more on the individual. That, in some ways easier than focusing on the larger picture. Uh, what kind of advise might you give to some of us who sort of live in or I can help an individual perhaps uh, in Altruism Born of Suffering in, in bringing to that point but you're taking about a much bigger picture and what do I need or any of us need to feel, to be able to work in a larger uh, sphere than most of us have been training to, to work in. 

01:00:45
ERVIN STAUB It's very difficult because, you know, most of us feel disempowered. You know, how do I affect things in these huge complex, variable country uh, where so many systems have become so establish and really kind of rigid. Uh, uh, couple of weeks ago I was, together with a group of people and a couple of people were saying that uhm, they turn off the news, they don't listen to the news about Iraq because you know, what they can do if it's upsetting and that upset me quite a bit. It's not even exposing ourselves to information but also understanding and we really need to join together. So what are some of the things we can do? We can and we are still talking about the same realm. Trying to reduce the violence in the world. Improve things that way. Now we can also improve things in many other way but first of all of course there are organizations that welcome these issues. These organizations now this can be really annoying because they write to you and just ask you for money. Well, we need to put support them financially but we also need to try to break them open a little bit so that we can engage more with each other and support each other in this work together. There are almost everywhere community organizations that are involved and worked together. You can get groups of people together. The media is really bad. 

01:02:30
Empowering the Individual through the Media 

01:02:30
ERVIN STAUB  I mean they just use government sources for a lot of their news and represent government positions. They don't take enough of their independent position uh, they don't speak out, they don't write about all kinds of important issues. What can you do if, I believe that if huge numbers of people wrote letters to them saying why don't you write about this? They would begin to write about it. Uhm, if you write a single letter and asking them to publish it on their editorial page and it is about some issue that you care about but they, that's not going to have an effect but we don't necessarily just want our letters to be published. We want their coverage to change and even though you don't see yourself in the newspaper. If a lot of people join together and do these things it can shift the coverage and that's very important. So that's another thing. We need to make our leaders have more moral courage. What do I mean by moral courage? I mean people acting on their moral values, maybe I'm optimist but I still believe that they have moral values. People acting on their moral values in spite of potential or actual opposition. Look in this country, if we speak out what's going to happen to us? So we need to let our leaders know as many of us. Imagine if this video that you are preparing was shown on a television program that reach ten million people and five million of those people wrote letters to these people and said I want you to speak about this. I want to speak that. It would have some effect. It would have some influence and it would spread. So the point is all of us need to remain active and remain active because of the principle of it. What I mean is that sometimes just doing the thing is beneficial at least for ourselves that we maintain a sense of dignity and some sense of morality by doing these things. Even if we don't know how much difference they make. So this is really I think very important for us. One of the things happens in therapy and people talk about their experiences and their counselors or therapist, somebody listens in a thoughtful and empathic way is that, that person's suffering is acknowledged, there too it is hurt. And that is very important and that's very healing. And people who suffered greatly have a tremendous need to have their suffer be acknowledged. 

01:06:00
Restorative Justice 

01:06:00
ERVIN STAUB  Now people who have suffered greatly often yearn for some kind of justice. And this is certainly true in the course of violence and uhm, and uhm, and this can be extremely important also to try to engage in a meaningful and reasonable justice processes. There are now these new, new type of justice processes, restorative justice people call it when, this is also followed the individual level and also it often happens when, you know, somewhere in the street burglars and other person and attacks another person. These kinds of violence it doesn't happen so far as far as I know when a child is victimized deeply in the family but perpetrators and victims are brought together. This only happens if the perpetrators have either confessed or have been found guilty in court and then they are willing to do this and then they brought together either only with the victim but more often with family members from both sides or French also sometimes members of the community and everybody can say what they want and in the course of this often there are very meaningful conversations and the perpetrators acknowledge what they have done and apologize and apology is very powerful for people. You could say surprisingly powerful because somebody has done real harm to them but a heartfelt apology that seems that way and felt that way can really do some real psychological good. So I think that meaningful justice processes can also contribute to Altruism Born of Suffering. 

01:07:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD You said it well and I wanna thank you unless there's something else that you wanna add. I wanna thank you very much for having us the privilege to talk about it and in my hope that I will not be just a bystander. 

01:08:00
ERVIN STAUB  Thank you. I very much appreciate that opportunity to talk with you.
