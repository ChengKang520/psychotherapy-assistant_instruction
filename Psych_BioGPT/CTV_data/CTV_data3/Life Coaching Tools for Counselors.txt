ALEXANDER STREET PRESS Microtraining Associates, Inc. 888-505-5576 info@emicrotraining.com www.emicrotraining.com Microtraining Associates is a Division of Alexander Street Press 800.889.5937 703-212-8520 sales@alexanderstreet.com www.alexanderstreet.com Microtraining Associates Presents Life Coaching: Tools for Counselors Kay Richardson MA, MFT,ACC What is Life Coaching? 

00:00:40
KAY RICHARDSON So I’ll give you the definition and the philosophy that’s behind it. So coaching is partnering with clients in a thought provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their potential both professionally and personally. So, it’s you know, you can hear in that that it’s collaborative, it’s creative and it’s inspiring. So um… it’s also tremendously respectful. The philosophy behind it is one that honors the client as expert on his or her own life and work and coaching also views each client as creative resourceful and whole. 

00:01:25
What is the origin of that definition? 

00:01:30
KAY RICHARDSON Yes, um… it comes from an organization called the International Coach Federation and that’s just the largest global organization for the organizing coaches, certifying them, also accrediting coach training programs. 

00:01:45
How does this collaborative process work? 

00:01:50
KAY RICHARDSON So in this process there is really four parts, four main parts to it. Um, and so it first begins with discovering, clarifying and aligning with what the client wants to achieve and then secondly, you encourage client self-discovery. So that could include you know, usually you are starting with whatever it is they’re really wanting to know more about and then helping them discover who they really are? What's really most important to them? So that then they can align their life with that. Um, so then the third part is eliciting client generated solutions and strategies. So this is a really key component, because you are always looking for a way into discover the clients best answers for themselves. You know, rather than me telling the client what they should do, its me working to find their way to get to deeper part of themselves that really holds those best answers. So that’s what that therapy is about. And in the fourth part is holding the client responsible and accountable meaning helping them to make commitment to themselves so that they actually follow through and helping them structure that in a way that’s really doable for them so that they get to set themselves up for success. 

00:03:10
How do you carry out this process? 

00:03:15
KAY RICHARDSON So there is not one right way. Um, you know because its collaborative you really want to work with each unique client to help discover, okay how am I getting go about helping this particular person find their best answers, create a plan that’s gonna work for them and follow through. Um, so I’m gonna demonstrate a number of tools that I have found particularly useful in the session that’s coming up and in that I’ll break it down and I’ll outline each tool before we get to that part. So that we will be able to see you know, how I go about doing it. But I just also want to throw in that you know, I don’t believe there is one best way, one right way. I believe, you know I really hold a lot of respect for the tremendous variety of approaches there are out there for working with clients, because there are so many unique people on the planet. There is a need for a (inaudible ) approaches. This are just some tools that I have found particularly useful. 

00:04:10
Coaching is… partnering with clients thought-provoking/creative process inspires to maximize potential Respectful philosophy… honors client as expert believes every client is creative/resourceful/whole 

00:04:15
KAY RICHARDSON Just to review, coaching is partnering with clients in a thought-provoking, creative process that inspires them to maximize their potential. Coaching is based on a respectful philosophy that honors the client as the expert in his or her life and work and also believes every client is creative, resourceful and whole. 

00:04:45
Collaborative Process: 1. Discover, clarify, and align with what client wants to achieve 2. Encourage client self-discovery 3. Elicit client-generated solutions and strategies 4. Hold client responsible and accountable Coaching assumes… client is ready for change taking responsibility for their life interested in maximizing potential counseling = wider range of clients coaching tools integrate into counseling when respectful philosophy fits 

00:04:50
KAY RICHARDSON So what you do in coaching is a collaborative process that includes four parts. First you discover, clarify and align with what the client wants to achieve. Secondly, you encourage client’s self-discovery. You elicit client-generated solutions and strategies and then fourth, you hold the client responsible and accountable. So it’s important to note that coaching assumes that the client is ready for change. That they are taking responsibility for their life and they are interested in maximizing their professional potential. And counseling addresses a wider range of clients and challenges but coaching tools can be integrated into counseling, especially when the respectful philosophy is a fit. For example, in post-modern approaches such as collaborative language systems, solution focused or narrative therapy. These definitions and some of the tools that will be demonstrated were adapted from these sources.

International Coach Federation (ICF) coachfederation.org Coach for Life, ICF Accredited Coach Training Program coachforlife.com Life Coaching Tools Discover client’s language for accessing their own answers How do you describe the deeper part of you that knows what’s best for you? 

00:06:05
KAY RICHARDSON The International Coach Federation and Coach for Life, an ICF accredited coach training program. So the following will be excerpts of actual sessions with clients that illustrate life coaching tools that counselors can integrate into their work. First, we’ll start with a young women named, Jessi. And I’ll begin by discovering the clients language for accessing their own answers. The important question here is how do you describe the deeper part of you that knows what's best for you? 

00:06:50
KAY RICHARDSON So Jessi it’s great to meet you. 

00:06:55
JESSI Me too. 

00:06:55
KAY RICHARDSON And first what I’m really curious to know about is just to understand when you think of finding your own best answers what language for you describes that deeper part of yourself that knows what's best for you. 

00:07:10
JESSI A language um, as… as far as I… 

00:07:15
KAY RICHARDSON …like. 

00:07:15
JESSI …what am I… 

00:07:15
KAY RICHARDSON …would you refer to you know, I get in touch with my heart or… 

00:07:20
JESSI Hmmm… 

00:07:20
KAY RICHARDSON I trust my gut or what… what for you describes when you are looking for your best answers. 

00:07:25
JESSI Um, I usually trust my gut like that kind of just… that intuition that because you know, when I first in the passage(ph) really kind of gotten me to where I want to be. 

00:07:35
KAY RICHARDSON Okay, it’s really served you. 

00:07:35
JESSI It certainly well when I don’t… am like I should have listened to myself. 

00:07:40
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah. 

00:07:40
JESSI So I’m just like I’ve… I’ve kind of learned to trust myself and not second guess so much. 

00:07:45
KAY RICHARDSON Nice. 

00:07:45
JESSI It’s usually isn’t there going in the right place. 

00:07:50
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah. 

00:07:50
JESSI Yeah. 

00:07:50
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah, that’s wonderful because getting into that point where you realize well, I don’t want to second guess myself. I need to really trust that first instinct. 

00:07:55
JESSI Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:07:55
KAY RICHARDSON Its… that’s a valuable resource to know. 

00:08:00
JESSI Right. And I used the second guess just because I’m like I don’t know what I’m talking about blah… blah… blah… you know, if I don’t (inaudible ) to inform on something… 

00:08:07
KAY RICHARDSON Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:08:07
JESSI …or have all the information yet. 

00:08:10
KAY RICHARDSON Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:08:10
JESSI …but it… in the, in the last few years I’ve really encountered listening to myself. 

00:08:15
KAY RICHARDSON Nice. 

00:08:15
JESSI And it’s worked out. So… 

00:08:15
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:08:15
JESSI Yeah. 

00:08:20
KAY RICHARDSON Well, that’s a lot of what this work is about is learning to access that to get clarity on anything that you are really wanting to move forward with. 

00:08:25
Guided Meditation Breathe to relax and open Clear stress, tension, worry Connect with deeper self What to take away? Client’s intention guides 

00:08:30
KAY RICHARDSON So next I’ll be guiding Jessi through a meditation in which I invite her to breath to relax her body and open her mind in spirit. And as she is breathing out, I’m inviting her to clear any stress or tension or worry anything she is wanting to let go off. And then as she is breathing in to replace that with her connection with the deeper part of herself. And then to ask that deeper part of herself what would I love to take with me from this session? And this intention that the client creates guides the focus throughout the rest of the session. 

00:09:15
JESSI Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:09:15
KAY RICHARDSON So, if you like just to start would you mind just sitting back and just close your eyes and just taking a few deep breath just to get connected with… 

00:09:25
JESSI Sure. 

00:09:25
KAY RICHARDSON …your intuition and your gut just that deeper part of you. Is that sounds okay to you? 

00:09:30
JESSI Yeah, it’s fine. 

00:09:30
KAY RICHARDSON Okay, so just take a few deep easy breath and as you do just allow yourself to let go of any stress, any tension, any worries. Just imagine as you are breathing out, you are releasing anything you wanting to let go off in this moment. Just to clear the way. So that as you breath in you are breathing in that connection with your intuition, with the deeper part of yourself. That part of you that knows what's best for you. So that you can come to clarity for yourself in this session. If there is anything else you are wanting to release just imagine it going out as you breath out. And allowing room for you to connect to even deeper level as you breath in. 

00:10:50
[sil.] 

00:10:55
KAY RICHARDSON Now if you like Jessi just ask yourself what would I love to take away from this session? And just see you’re your intuition. What your gut says? What serving most to focus on this session and when you feel like you have an answer just open your eyes and share. 

00:11:25
Dialogue to understand key questions client is ready to clarify for moving forward 

00:11:30
KAY RICHARDSON Now Jessi and I are gonna have a dialogue to understand the key question she is ready to clarify for moving forward. 

00:11:45
[sil.] 

00:11:50
KAY RICHARDSON Did something come up for you? 

00:11:55
JESSI Yeah. I did. Um, so I’m involved in the graduate program at State, MFT. 

00:12:05
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:12:05
JESSI And you know, sometime I don’t know if it’s a stress or if I’m burning out. 

00:12:10
KAY RICHARDSON Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:12:10
JESSI But sometime I’m just wondering if this is still right for me. 

00:12:15
KAY RICHARDSON Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:12:15
JESSI If I’m kind of and part of me it feels like it is and I don’t know if that’s maybe this phobia of I’m like starting my career like this is, no, I can’t really mess around anymore. You know, and I kind of have to settle myself. So I have a kind of like (inaudible ) on spirit about me. I just like to get up and leave the country for a few months. I do that often. 

00:12:36
KAY RICHARDSON Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:12:40
JESSI So you know, it just I’m having some structure. 

00:12:40
KAY RICHARDSON Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:12:45
JESSI …in my life. 

00:12:45
KAY RICHARDSON Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:12:45
JESSI So as far as like career wise and academically… 

00:12:45
KAY RICHARDSON Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:12:50
JESSI And you know it’s… you know I don’t want to say if I myself fighting it, because I… I really love it. I really do but it’s I have like this dissonance. 

00:12:55
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. There is kind of push pull going on… 

00:13:00
JESSI Yeah, like I’m really into it and then I… I want to like run you know, like ah… you know, I don’t know it’s personality thing or just a situational thing. 

00:13:10
KAY RICHARDSON Sure. 

00:13:10
JESSI So now… 

00:13:10
KAY RICHARDSON So… so when you leave this session what would you love to have clarified? 

00:13:20
JESSI Um, well I… I don’t necessarily think like a definite decision can be made. I think that might take some time, but at least it may be like shed light on maybe the pros and cons and what would be if I want one way or if I want the other way if I stayed if I left, just kind of… 

00:13:40
KAY RICHARDSON Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:13:40
JESSI Just kind of work it out, because it’s kind of like jumbled. 

00:13:45
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:13:45
JESSI Right now. 

00:13:45
KAY RICHARDSON Okay and what helps you in the past when you thought about other big decisions like that. What’s helped you to work it out? I really admire your independence and your passion and your freedom. I think it’s those are wonderful qualities. 

00:14:00
JESSI Oh, thank you. 

00:14:05
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah. 

00:14:05
JESSI Yeah. I don’t know if there was like cloud my um, my determination and my will to continue sometime. 

00:14:10
KAY RICHARDSON Well, I hear that you wanna come to peace with how to… 

00:14:15
JESSI Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:14:15
KAY RICHARDSON Um, how to honor all these parts of you. 

00:14:20
JESSI Yeah. 

00:14:20
KAY RICHARDSON And all of these passions. 

00:14:20
JESSI Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:14:20
KAY RICHARDSON You know is there a way to do that. 

00:14:25
JESSI It’s like if want to be happy with one missing. 

00:14:25
KAY RICHARDSON Right. Okay. 

00:14:30
JESSI Yeah. 

00:14:30
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. So is that kind of the ultimate question. How… or how would you worried. I just threw out that idea of how can honor all these parts of my passion of who I am, but how would you… how would you say that kind of ultimate question if you were to crafted into a question or a couple of question. 

00:14:50
JESSI Well, if… if I stayed where I am you know, finish this program, got through it. Um, will I be able to still have the freedom to move about as I like and you know, in especially sometime committing so much of myself and I managed to do this program, I really would like it to pay off, because if it didn’t I don’t want to look at it as a waste of time. 

00:15:20
KAY RICHARDSON Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:15:20
JESSI So I mean, just being able to just incorporate both like the traveling, the freedom Australia you know my boyfriend, but that’s part of it is being able to, the freedom to go back and forth… 

00:15:35
KAY RICHARDSON Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:15:35
JESSI …between countries. 

00:15:35
KAY RICHARDSON Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:15:35
JESSI You know and there is… and there is all the things on the side like I wanted to do a wild life rescue which I want to do forever, you know. 

00:15:45
KAY RICHARDSON There is little things on this side, I love that. 

00:15:45
JESSI The little things like building with organizations… yeah, I know that’s kind of I… 

00:15:50
KAY RICHARDSON Well no… no… no… I mean when you said do a, when you said do a wild life rescue, I didn’t… 

00:15:55
JESSI I know. 

00:16:00
KAY RICHARDSON I didn’t imagine you having to start the whole organization. Is that what you meant? 

00:16:00
JESSI Um, like I would… I fell on one you know, acres of land and I you know, big cats like tigers and jaguars like. We have… I love it. I seriously Wyoming acres of land. 

00:16:15
KAY RICHARDSON So it start, you’re having to start the whole thing from, from beginning to end or being able to go be a part of something that’s odd. 

00:16:20
JESSI Be part of it… 

00:16:25
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:16:25
JESSI But I would want that as like my thing. 

00:16:25
KAY RICHARDSON You have the vision. Yeah. 

00:16:25
JESSI Yeah. 

00:16:25
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:16:25
JESSI Yeah, its kind of insane. 

00:16:30
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:16:30
JESSI Yeah. 

00:16:30
KAY RICHARDSON Well, there is a lot of life ahead of you, you know. 

00:16:35
JESSI Yeah. 

00:16:35
KAY RICHARDSON So I don’t think it’s insane actually. I think it’s impressive um, okay so… so… I want to… I want to get these down to a few really key questions, you know what we were taking… 

00:16:45
JESSI Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:16:45
KAY RICHARDSON We are taking what you’ve laid out. You are looking it in making this decision at this cross roads… 

00:16:55
JESSI Okay. 

00:16:55
KAY RICHARDSON And then can I horn(ph) it into a few key questions so what would… what I’ve got first that you have said and you correct me any part that’s not right. Um, if I stayed in this program would I still have the freedom to move about. 

00:17:10
JESSI Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:17:10
KAY RICHARDSON Is there anything to add to that? Or is there a second question. 

00:17:15
JESSI Yeah when… when I’m done well I still want this. 

00:17:20
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:17:25
JESSI And it… it like at this day right now, you know that question kind of comes up because you know, it’s so much work like I’m writing all the time… 

00:17:30
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah. 

00:17:35
JESSI …I’m reading, I mean you know you are in the place where I might be at one point and I’m just maybe I’m just burning out and maybe it’s been a rough week and I’m just like, oh my god! Okay, I’m gonna put in all this work. This is so intense. 

00:17:50
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah. 

00:17:50
JESSI I’ve worked, you know a lot of my social life is kind of on the backburner right now and I’m like… 

00:17:55
KAY RICHARDSON Is it worth it? 

00:17:55
JESSI Is it worth it? 

00:17:55
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah. 

00:17:55
JESSI Am I gonna really want this? 

00:17:55
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah. 

00:17:55
JESSI When I… when I come out the other end… 

00:18:00
KAY RICHARDSON Yes… yes okay… 

00:18:00
JESSI So… 

00:18:00
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. Umm… okay and then the other piece I saw are heard earlier was can I have travel freedom Australia and this career. Is that the rest of that question or… 

00:18:15
JESSI Yeah, I mean. 

00:18:15
KAY RICHARDSON …is there another way to put that. 

00:18:15
JESSI Me still desiring this career. 

00:18:20
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:18:20
JESSI I guess that will be. 

00:18:20
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:18:20
Future Self Vision 

00:18:20
KAY RICHARDSON This next tool is a future self-vision. This is a longer co-creative visualization for accessing inner wisdom. And one note I want to add is that if a client struggles with depression, it’s important to clearly invite their ideal vision of their future. Also you will see in this section with Jessi how this visualization can be an ongoing resource for discovering her best answers from within. 

00:18:55
[sil.] 

00:19:00
KAY RICHARDSON Okay, so the way this process works, its a guided visualization and we haven’t done any guided visualization and you know what that is. 

00:19:05
JESSI Um, no. I have kind of meditation like things… 

00:19:10
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah. It’s kind of… 

00:19:10
JESSI …similar… 

00:19:10
KAY RICHARDSON Exactly, it’s that kind of thing. 

00:19:10
JESSI Okay. 

00:19:15
KAY RICHARDSON Um, and so what I want you to know is you are totally in-charge, this isn’t like it hypnosis or anything like that. 

00:19:20
JESSI Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:19:20
KAY RICHARDSON You are in-charge so if at any point you want to stop and open your eyes and say, hey this is going on for me or this isn’t working for me. 

00:19:25
JESSI Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:19:25
KAY RICHARDSON I want you to tell me. 

00:19:30
JESSI Okay. 

00:19:30
KAY RICHARDSON Um but for most people it’s really fun. 

00:19:30
JESSI Okay. 

00:19:30
KAY RICHARDSON So um, so and as we go I’ll be guiding you through this and then also you will be responding to questions and um… I’ll be writing down your responses, so you can know I’m getting everything down. 

00:19:45
JESSI Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:19:45
KAY RICHARDSON And then at the end um, you have this I want you, if you’d like just put this aside with your pen and paper and you will be able to write about your experience at the end. 

00:19:55
JESSI Okay. 

00:20:00
KAY RICHARDSON Okay, so if you like Jessi just sit back and relax. Just get totally comfortable and as you do just come back to take in those deep easy breaths. Just allowing yourself to get really relaxed in your body and as you’re breathing in deeply just feel that fresh air coming in, filling you with new life and as you are breathing out just feel yourself let in go of any tension. Just know that there is no right way to do this process that any thing that comes up for you is absolutely perfect and with each breath just allow yourself to relax into your body a little bit more. Feel yourself shifting out of your head back into that intuitive side. Your intuition, connecting with your gut and part of you that really knows what's best for you. Just allowing yourself to feel really relaxed in your body. And just know that the sound of my voice and your voice will just take you deeper into the experience. At first, I like you to imagine instead of here picture that you are in one of your favorite places in nature. Whatever place comes to mind first and just describe to me what that place is like and where you are. 

00:21:50
JESSI I’m on the beach. Always my favorite place. Um, so I was visioning it so hard, what's the question like where I am… 

00:22:00
KAY RICHARDSON Just describe it a little bit, yeah. 

00:22:00
JESSI Describe it, okay. 

00:22:00
KAY RICHARDSON What you are experiencing now. 

00:22:05
JESSI Well, me usually just you know, lying on the sand. Um, listening to the waves crash, that’s my favorite sound ever and it’s not too hot. Just… just the right… I don’t really need, you know short and well, a bathing suit on but. 

00:22:25
KAY RICHARDSON You don’t need an extra layer. 

00:22:25
JESSI Right. Exactly like I can just like perfect beach attire and… 

00:22:30
KAY RICHARDSON Okay, okay. 

00:22:30
JESSI Yeah. 

00:22:30
KAY RICHARDSON Great. Perfect so just let yourself settle in um, the beach there. Just totally relaxed and just imagine hearing the sounds of the waves coming in and feel your breath starting to sink up with those waves as it’s coming in slowly. You could hear that sound crashing on the coast. Just clearing out any tension in your body, you can feel yourself just completely relaxing with the waves. And as the waves go out, you just imagine it taking out any tension, any stress, any worries going out with the waves. It’s a perfect temperature for you, you are totally comfortable. You can hear the seagulls and the sound of the waves that no other sounds. And it’s just you there enjoying the freedom of being independent on your own in nature. You know, I want you to just imagine that as you are totally relaxed and totally comfortable, a cloud comes down out of the sky just floating down gently and gently slips underneath you and safely, slowly carries you up into the sky. You are totally safe, totally secure floating along on this magical cloud. You are at peace and relaxed. And you notice that things are moving much more quickly, knowing that you are totally safe in at peace the whole time. And as the cloud slowly begins to descend toward the earth, you intuitively know you are not returning to the same place you were in before. You are returning to the earth 20 years in the future. So as it’s slowly begins to come down, begin to notice where is that you live 20 years in the future. And that’s the place that you are coming down. What's this place like? Just take it in, notice the lay of the land knowing this is where you will be living 20 years in the future and as you are slowly touching down to the earth and the cloud gently slips from underneath. Imagine yourself standing up and looking around and taking in all your surroundings. Notice what season it is. What's important in this place? Just enjoy looking all around and when you are ready just begin to describe the essence of this place. 

00:26:10
[sil.] 

00:26:15
JESSI Um, well pretty… I’m… I’m pretty much feeling like I’ll be in Australia. um… 

00:26:25
KAY RICHARDSON Is that the place that you saw yourself coming down? 

00:26:30
JESSI Yeah. 

00:26:30
KAY RICHARDSON Okay, so describe what you are seeing just around you? 

00:26:35
JESSI Um, I’m seeing it’s actually a the time that I lived in while I was there um, it’s really nice it’s like a little park near by and it’s… it’s in the city, but it’s kind of little bit secluded and more of like a neat tree part of the city, if that make sense? 

00:26:55
KAY RICHARDSON Hmmm… Hmmm… Um, what's the feeling of that area? 

00:27:00
JESSI Um, there is kind of like a sense of calm and just kind of contentness(ph), but kind of in a role in a facility(ph) like of excitement almost like, I don’t know I’m just really happy to be there. Like excited and calm and those… can exist but… 

00:27:20

00:28:10
KAY RICHARDSON Okay, so just take a moment and just allow yourself to drop out of thinking about what you would love to have… 

00:28:20
JESSI Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:28:20
KAY RICHARDSON And just imagine being there in this place of calm and contentment inner woven with excitement. Just being in that space first of all, so instead of thinking about what it is you would love to see there, just allow yourself to really imagine that you are there, just taking in this place first of all. So just enjoy being back there in this secluded nature part of the city, looking around just imagine yourself there. Tapping into that visual side of you, enjoying see what it is that you see before you, feeling what it is to be there in that sense of calm and contentment with that excitement inner woven. Just imagine that you begin to walk toward the home of your future self, you know what's there and so you intuitively begin to look for the home and when you reach the outside of the home just describe what you see there. Just from your intuition, not from thinking about it… 

00:29:40
JESSI Um, I usually I guess when I well, I suppose to think but it feels its quite um, tamy(ph), its open, its light, it’s a… its just has that homey feeling. 

00:30:00

00:41:10
KAY RICHARDSON How so? 

00:41:15
JESSI Just maybe my desires for some, some more permanence and it’s kind of played in umm… because you know, I like what I’m Doing something that I don’t move around as much, but def… definitely still time to um… take vacations and be able to you know come and go freely, but just the sense that I’ll, I’ll maybe want to stay where I’m longer for periods of time. so about, yes permanence again you know.

JESSI Yeah. 

00:49:45
KAY RICHARDSON So… we will… we will do that as soon as you come out of this thing. Alright, so when you’re ready, just imagine walking with your future self back through the home, enjoying all that you’re seeing, and then as you come to the front door, she gives you a big hug. She is so glad that she came. Her love and understanding will go with you and she let she know that you’re welcome to return anytime you like, you can just close your eyes and imagine being in front of the home and she will open the door and greet you with open on, she can do this on your own when you want to get answers. She will give a one last hug, then you imagine walking out the front door and you know notice there is your cloud, that magical cloud is waiting for you and you imagine lying down in the cloud as it safely, slowly picks you up, carries you back off into the sky, floating along safely, securely brining you back to the present time and bringing you back with the all answers you receive from yourself, you future self. And we see the cloud floating down into the room now, brining you back where you are now and as you come back into the room just bring this experience back with you all the feelings that she want to bring back the contentment, the clarity, the freedom and when you’re ready just pick up your pen and paper and write whatever you’d like about your experience. Alright, Jessi so how was that for you? 

00:52:00
JESSI It was good… 

00:52:00

00:56:55
VINAY (ph) Hmm…Hmm… 

00:56:55
KAY RICHARDSON So if you would like close your eyes, just reconnect with your breath, just allowing yourself to get really comfortable, reconnecting with feeling your gut, your intuition and allowing yourself to just imagine you’re in the trees at night just surrounded by the beauty of these trees, just imagine that there is a beautiful moon out and you’re just enjoying feeling this place of peace surrounded by the trees bathed in moon light. It’s perfect a temperature for you… you can feel the air on your skin, you’re totally comfortable, totally at peace and you allow yourself to get really relaxed there, knowing you’re safe and you’re able to really connect with yourself and that part of you that knows what’s best for you.

00:58:15
KAY RICHARDSON And as you’re relaxing there in the moonlight amongst the trees, just imagine what your ideal would be, your ideal picture that would create a connection with your sister and bring you back to that place of peace, you can settle into. 

00:58:45
[sil.] 

00:58:50
KAY RICHARDSON And as you begin to see that ideal in your mind. Just know that the sound of your voice and my voice will just take you even deeper into your experience. So you can just describe what you’re seeing in your mind would be your ideal of connection with your sister and peace within. 

00:59:15
VINAY (ph) So what I see is having my sister there with me in the woods and just casually relaxing and having just really… really relaxing walk and just I… kind of missed the… the conversation we would have very honest kinda conversation on what’s going on their life and just that trust we have with each other. 

00:59:45
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm… What would you love to be able to say to her right now if you all were having that walk and you’re able to be reconnecting, what would you love to be able to say that would help to create that reconnection? 

01:00:10
VINAY (ph) I’d want her, I’d want her to know that I’m here to support her and that I love her. 

01:00:20
[sil.] 

01:00:25
KAY RICHARDSON Great. Can you imagine saying that to her, you know on this walk as you’re moving along and just feeling that trust returning. 

01:00:45
Ask deeper self questions to find their own best answers. 

01:00:45
KAY RICHARDSON Now, I will invite Vinay(ph) to ask her deeper self questions to find her own best answers. This is really at the heart of these tools. 

01:01:00
[sil.] 

01:01:05
KAY RICHARDSON And then just imagine that she can continues and she is going back home after you had this great talk and walk and you go back to the place where you started to sit down and connect with yourself, just feeling so much peace you can settle into there in your own special place amongst the trees. 

01:01:35
[sil.] 

01:01:40
KAY RICHARDSON Now, just imagine asking yourself that deeper part of you, what would help me to create this vision? What would help me to come to clarity or creating this connection with my sister now? Just see what answers come out and just speak whatever comes to mind. 

01:02:15
[sil.] 

01:02:20
KAY RICHARDSON I think about reflecting on our relationship last year and reaching out to her and apologizing for things that I’ve done that I’ve made her misunderstood my intentions and though I’ve tried to reach out to her numerous of times last year and I just hope that I’m saying(ph) that she has open with the invitation. 

01:02:50
Design next steps to move forward What would be the next easy step? What would set you up for success? 

01:02:55
KAY RICHARDSON Now, we will go right into designing the next steps for moving forward. You can ask questions like what would be the next easy step? Or what would set you up for success? And this can be done during the guided visualization or following it. 

01:03:15
VINAY (ph) I think coming into her with you know coming from me, I apologize for doing these things or seeing these things and um, making her really feel like that… that I’m really hear to support her and I didn’t want her to mis… umm… misinterpret and misunderstand. 

01:03:35
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. What would be the next easy step? Just imagine asking your gut, your intuition, what would be the next easy step for me to move toward this? 

01:03:50
VINAY (ph) It’s probably I making the list of the things that I wanted to show with her and the things that I feel like I can take responsibility for. 

01:04:05
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

01:04:10
[sil.] 

01:04:15
KAY RICHARDSON Great and what would set you up for success in making this list, making it easy to fall with her. 

01:04:25
VINAY (ph) Allocate some time to really sit down and reflect and write out what this list would be. 

01:04:30
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

01:04:30
Commitment to self and plan for follow-through What would serve as a touchstone? What would make it doable/fun? 

01:04:35
KAY RICHARDSON At this point, I’ll invite Vinay to create a commitment to herself and a plan that helps her really follow-through. Questions that can be useful at this point are like what would serve as a touchstone or a maker and anchor for your commitment and what would make it doable and fun to actually follow-through on this. 

01:05:10
KAY RICHARDSON Okay, Vinay so you said that what would make it easy to follow-through as if you allocate the time to reflect and to make that list to thing she want to share with her and take responsibility for. So, I’m wondering if it would serve you right now and you tell me if this is something that would serve you to commit yourself to actually do that, to allocate that time to pick it down. 

01:05:40
VINAY (ph) Hmm…Hmm… 

01:05:40
KAY RICHARDSON Would that feel good to you? 

01:05:40
VINAY (ph) Yes. 

01:05:40
KAY RICHARDSON Okay and does it serve you to write that kind of thing down or is that the kind of thing you’d rather just know in your mind. 

01:05:50
VINAY (ph) I would probably write it down and put in my calendar to make sure I… 

01:05:50
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

01:05:55
VINAY (ph) …make the time. 

01:05:55
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. So, when you ready, just bring your beautiful place in the woods, back with you to the session, the feeling of piece and contentment there and the vision of being with your sister and being with yourself at a deeper level just bring that back with you and when you’re ready, if you would like to open your eyes and write down a commitment to yourself to actually allocate this time if you want to pick the time, whatever is gonna serve you most, just to make this commitment to yourself clear. 

01:06:30
VINAY (ph) Hmm…Hmm… 

01:06:30
KAY RICHARDSON Alright, so would you… would you like to read… what you… what you wrote. 

01:06:35
VINAY (ph) Okay um, that like to sit down and kind of spend at least two hours before Thanksgiving, because I figure… 

01:06:45
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah. 

01:06:45
VINAY (ph) …that’s a good holiday and… 

01:06:45

01:06:55
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… Nice. 

01:06:55
VINAY (ph) And things I take responsibility for and to let her know that, I support her and that I’m coming to her with… with these thoughts. 

01:07:05
KAY RICHARDSON Nice. And I… I see the deep breath that you just took what, what’s going on for you as she say that. 

01:07:10
VINAY (ph) Um, ah, what’s kind of bubbling up for me is this, because I’m… I want to say resistance, but what if… what if she doesn’t respond. 

01:07:25
KAY RICHARDSON Mmm… 

01:07:25
VINAY (ph) You know the concerns of whether she is not opened to this, because I’ve tried different things. 

01:07:30
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

01:07:30
VINAY (ph) And having had any response. So, it’s like I’m willing to do this. 

01:07:35
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

01:07:35
VINAY (ph) And… and I’m preparing myself that if she doesn’t respond that… that’s okay, that is still painful thing. 

01:07:40
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah. 

01:07:40
VINAY (ph) Yeah. 

01:07:40
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah. Is there anything you would like to put in place to take care of yourself around that possibility. 

01:07:55
VINAY (ph) Hmm… May be just to be really gentle myself and to think that it’s her not responding to me is our reflection of me personally, but maybe she is just not ready, so I just preparing myself a lot.
