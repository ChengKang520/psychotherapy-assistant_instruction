REBECCA E. MICHEL My name is Dr. Becky Michel, and I'm from… an Assistant Professor at Governors State University, within the division of psychology and counseling. Today, I'll be speaking with you about positive psychology, an area that I've been studying for over 15 years. Several years ago, a father was outside weeding his garden with his five-year-old daughter Nicky. He was focused and in a hurry to get done with his weeding. As you can imagine, his five-year-old daughter was not in such a hurry. She was throwing weeds. She was dancing about and acting like a typical five-year-old. He was furious. He had a job at hand and he yelled at her. His daughter Nicky ran away, then she came back, and she said to him, "Daddy, I want to talk with you." He said, "Yes, Nicky." And she said, "Daddy, do you remember before my fifth birthday? From the time I was three to the time I was five, I was a whiner. I whined everyday. And when I turned five, I decided not to whine anymore. That was the hardest thing, I had ever done. And if I can stop whining, then you can stop being such a grouch." At that moment, the father experienced a life changing paradigm shift. He realized that raising his daughter was not about fixing her weaknesses. Instead, it was about recognizing her potential. And being able to cultivate her to realize and help her live a meaningful and satisfying life. The man was Dr. Martin Seligman and this was the birth of the positive psychology movement. At that time, Dr. Seligman had recently been elected president of the American Psychological Association. The psychology profession had been very immersed with treating human suffering. Positive psychology offered alternative perspective. That it's important to not only study human suffering, but also to look at human strengths and resilience. Research was began to realize that human strengths conserve its buffers to mental health issues. Specifically there are three broad areas that are generally discussed within positive psychology. These are positive emotions, such as satisfaction, happiness and flow. These are positive subjective experiences. And these are inner personal virtues. It's within positive organizations such of a sense of community, civility and altruism. And we'll be talking about all of these for the rest of our time today. At its heart, positive psychology is the scientific study of what makes life worth living. It's the expectation that research and practice, empathize… emphasize both strengths and areas of growth. It's not meant to turn… replace traditional psychology. Instead, it was developed to compliment it. In order for counselors and psychologists to incorporate strengths within their work, there are several very concrete things that we can do. For one, we can start recognizing it individual strengths. And we can do that in a variety of different ways. We can listen, truly listen to the stories that they tell. And instead of making mental images and pointing out what's going wrong, we can listen to the stories they tell and point out their strengths, point out their areas of resilience. There are several different assessments that have been developed in order to help us create that strength base language. For example, the VS strengths survey, the VS survey of character strength and the StrengthsFinder. We can also use positive language and conceptualizations when we are speaking about our clients. And so, for example, I worked with the client, she is a mid manager, umm… at her organization. And she is great, she is visionary, she is positive, she knows how to put together a great team. But at the end of the day, she cringes. She gets physically ill, whenever there is a conflict. She worked her whole life to try to avoid any type of disagreements within her organization. And as you can imagine, that's not a very effective trait for a leader. And so, I've worked with her over time to not only conceptualize this as a weakness, her avoidance of conflict. But instead, we think about it has a strength that's gone (inaudible). So her strength is harmony. She really wants everyone to get along. And yet, that strength is motivating her so much, that it's actually become a weakness for her. So we need to find ways in psychotherapy and in counseling to help people identify their strengths to work around their weaknesses. We don't ignore the weaknesses. We find ways to work around them. And so with her, we utilize several of our other strengths to find out, okay, how can we manage conflict while also incorporating and celebrating harmony within the workplace. And then finally, the third concrete thing that counselors and psychologists can do is to expand the counseling framework to include strengths and environmental considerations. And so this is already being done in several different areas, like in school counseling, where measuring strengths based school counseling also strengths-based advocacy in schools, as well as strengths-based prospective in working with male clients. Addressing problems from a strength-based perspective may just require a shift and how we speak about clients and client problems. For example, rather than a treatment goal to decrease dissatisfaction, we might instead focus on increasing satisfaction. Life satisfaction is a particular interested positive, people within positive psychology. And life satisfaction is just defined as a sense of contentment and peace, saving from small gaps between wants and needs with accomplishments and attainments. And so essentially it's, you have your wants and your needs, and they're pretty close together. You have your accomplishments and attainments and you feel really good about them, and that's life satisfaction. And it can be measured in lots of different domains, including work, home, within your community, your health, your finances, parenting, or globally. For example, a five item satisfaction with life scale, would include questions such as, the conditions of my life are excellent. And if I could live my life over, I would change almost nothing. Now, how do you think life stage might impact life satisfaction? You think younger or older individuals order for greater satisfaction? Well, a study conducted by researchers at the University of Luxembourg reported that participants 63 and older reported next… Less negative thoughts, less depression and higher well-being than younger individuals. Moreover, the study asserted that older adults reported greater life satisfaction. In USA Today, in 2003, USA Today tried to set out to find the world's happiest man. After a nationwide search, throughout the States, the happiest man was determined to be… Bill Gates? No. Bill Clinton? No. Actually the happiest man was not rich, famous or powerful. He was a 45-year-old Virginia Beach man, who was a stock broker in a J. P. Godsey. Godsey was selected based on research that suggests that volunteer work, civic involvement, and quality of life, positively impacted a person's happiness. Godsey, a married father of two adult children is dedicated to numerous charities and non-profit organizations. According to Godsey, we wake up every morning full of choices. And your state of happiness is something that you can do every single day. How are you going to make your day this morning? Researchers defined happiness as spontaneous reflections of pleasant and unpleasant feelings of one's immediate experience. So it's about living in the moment, it's about being mindful. Martin Seligman, you've heard that name before identifies three types of happiness, the pleasant life, the good life and the meaningful life. According to Seligman, an individual like Godsey exemplifies all three. So how might you increase your happiness? The renowned happiness researcher Dr. Ed Diener suggests it appears that the way people perceive the world is much more important to happiness than the objective circumstances. So are you a person who sees your glass half full or half empty? At the end of the day, this perspective will shape how you experience the world. To those ends, I've always liked David Myers suggestions for happier life. Of his top 10 lists, my three favorites are realizing that enduring happiness doesn't come from success. Take control of your time, and give priority to close relationships. Flow. This is a very important term within positive psychology and something that you may have heard of before. It's the state of effortless concentration or enjoyment. And is one of the best known constructs in positive psychology. Flow is described as being so entirely consumed with an activity that one completely loses themselves in self-consciousness and acts effortlessly, with a heightened state of awareness of the here and now. Every four years, the Olympic Games provide countless opportunities for individuals to express flow. One remarkable example was Bob Beamon's world record breaking jump of 29 feet and 2.5 inches, at the 1968 Summer Olympic Games in Mexico City. His jump was more than two feet further than anybody had jumped before and held the record for over 20 years. In retrospect, he described the jump as follows. There is no answer for the performance, but everything was just perfect. The runway, my take-off. I went six feet in the air when I should have gone five and my concentration was perfect. It never happened quite that way before, I blocked out everything in the world except my focus on the jump. Now the world of sports, of course, provides vivid examples of flow. However, flow can also be experienced in schools. Research suggests that when students are provided with challenging tasks that match their skill level, teacher instruction that is relevant to them, and the learning environment is under their control, students can experience flow. Such findings emphasize the critical role of teachers, counselors and other adults within the education environment of our students.

REBECCA E. MICHEL There are many other individual trades that within positive psychology, such as, forgiveness, creativity, wisdom, spirituality and resilience. Within each of these individual trades, these are positive emotions that can be cultivated and learned. So depending on whether or not you are type of person who sees the glass half full or half empty, you can be taught to have and embrace positive emotions. In 1992, a hurricane roared through the Islands of Kauai. A category four hurricane with winds reaching 145 miles an hour ripped through the Island. With a… $1.8 billion of damage and leaving over 7,000 people homeless. It also interrupted a 40-year study on resiliency that was being conducted on the Island of Kauai. Doctors Dem… Doctors Emmy Werner and Ruth Smith started in 1955 and followed individuals over 40 years to assess their ability to bounce back their resiliency level. And so resiliency or patterns of adaptation, adaptation in the context of adversity or risk is an individual trait within individual psychology… positive psychology. Viewing the hurricane as a critical incident within their longitudinal study, Werner and Smith learned the individuals who are previously indicated as having high levels of resiliency were more likely to engage in proactive behavior before the storms arrival. So these individuals devoted time to getting ready for the storm, they boarded up their windows, they boarded up their doors, they reached out to their community members. And they… They purchased insurance to be able to… Right. To cover their home. And so these individuals, these resilient individuals actually reported less property damage and had greater psychological well-being following this storm. So in this manner, the authors found a very surprising finding that individuals who set goals and plan for the future, these individuals were resilient and were able to better cope with adversity. So again, within positive psychology, we have these three areas. These positive subjective experiences. These positive emotions, and then finally these positive organizations or the interpersonal values that occur within communities. And so this can be broadly thought about as a few different areas. And I'm gonna mention three. So are you connected with your community? Do you have individuals who you can… You can connect and speak with an individual level? How much are you connected with civility within your life? And then finally, how altruistic are you? Give blood, offer to read to somebody who can't see, volunteer at a local hospital, leave a huge tip for a very small check. Do something for someone else that requires time and effort on your part. Ask your friend how they are doing and really listen before you go and respond about how you're doing. These are examples of Altruism. Behavior designed to benefit another person. Within the realm of positive psychology, researchers have identified two types of altruism, ego motive… motivated behaviors. And these are behaviors that are benefiting others, but at the end of the day, they are really benefiting us. So an example of that would be, going to give blood, but really wanting to do it so that you can gorge yourself on the food afterwards. So that's an example of ego motivated. And then another example, umm… is empathy motivated altruism. And this is behavior driven by an emotional response to the perceived plight of another individual. So this is known as pure altruism. And it could be cultivated in many ways. For example, one way, I tried to work with my supervisees and my students is to try to really empathize with others by walking in their shoes, in order to cultivate altruism within themselves, and then to model that for their clients. So at its heart, positive psychology seeks to determine what makes life worth living. You can ask yourself, when will you discover your full potential? How can seeing the world from a different perspective help you to do that? The field of positive psychology is very much still in its infancy. And only time will tell, if the suggested approaches will prove effective in supporting optimum health and wellness, in order to help people live more deeply satisfying and meaningful lives. All right, so that's the end of my presentation. And so now I'd love to turn to the audience to see if you all have any questions. 

00:17:20
UNKNOWN I have a question. 

00:17:20
REBECCA E. MICHEL Yes. 

00:17:20
UNKNOWN You had earlier mentioned, uh, mindfulness. How do you incorporate mindfulness into positive psychology? 

00:17:30
REBECCA E. MICHEL That's such a great question. And this is an area of study that has devoted a lot of research, umm… and really, areas really throughout the entire world. As you may know, mindfulness has been studied and practiced around the world for centuries, really. And, umm… just now, really, in western societies has mindfulness started emerging as a relevant and practical and cheap technique that counselors can use with clients. And so specifically within the realm of positive psychology, mindfulness allows us and encourages us to stop, to stop all the extra thoughts that are going on in our minds and to focus on the present moment. And at the end of the day, positive psychology encourages us to think about what's going on in the present moment and to be able to recognize what's going well, and what's not going well, and what we can do about it. And so mindfulness helps us, and mindfulness practices help us to get more in touch with what's going on in the present moment. And so there are lots of different techniques that you can use to incorporate mindfulness into your counseling sessions. For example, every time that I start a counseling session, we start the beginning of the session, whether I'm working with students and schools, whether I'm working with career, uh, clients, whether I'm working with older adults. Whoever I'm working with, we take the first couple of minutes of our session and we just pause. We take time to center ourselves. We take time to acknowledge the fact that we are here and this is our 30 minutes or 50 minutes and this is this time to focus on what's happening at the present moment. And we allow ourselves to let go of all the other things that are bothering us. The fact that we forgot to walk with dog this morning, you know. Or the fact that we have to pick up, you know, our partner's laundry after work. We throw away all these thoughts and we just present… Focus on the present moment. And by doing that it's amazing how you see a shift in clients, from being scattered and really all over the place, to trying to find their best way of being centered. And so that's what I do at the beginning and we also do that at the end of therapy or counseling sessions. So every session, we take the final few minutes after I, you know, check in on what they have done during the session and how it's going and what they're planning to do for the next week, we then take a few minutes to honor that space that we had together and to release whatever was discussed into that room, so that then they're not taking that back with them. So those are a couple of things to do within the counseling sessions. But then there are so many other things that you can do to practice mindfulness. And again, mindfulness is being present in the moment. So one thing I do with supervision groups, for example, is each supervision group, I incorporate a new mindfulness exercise so that these practical and internship students can learn and practice mindfulness themselves, so that then they can go out and utilize those skills with clients. So for example, one might be mindful eating or mindful drinking. And so that might be taking a piece of chocolate, for example, or taking a sip of water. And rather than just do what we normally do, uh, which, I don't know about you, but I just pop chocolate in my mouth and eat it as fast as I can, with water I'll just gulp it down quickly, usually. But instead, you want to focus on what's happening in the moment. Focus on the senses, focus on everything that you are experiencing. So for this cup of water, I would notice how it would feel in my hand. I would actually smell it. Water doesn't usually have a smell, but it does, right? When you actually take a movement to smell it, you can smell it with your senses. You, you can see how this process is slowing me down, right? And then you take a sip. You notice how it feels on your tongue, you notice how it feels going down the back of your throat and I bet this is making you all pretty thirsty right now. So we'll get you some water but… So… And then you talk about. Okay, what was that like with these students, right? What was it like to look at that water? What was it like to feel the water in your hand? What was it like the anticipation before you drank the water? What did it feel like in your mouth as you swished it around and then when you finally were satisfied? Did it make you satisfied? Or did it make you thirsting more, right? So that process, it's a really simple example. But it, it's a way or a technique that helps you to slow down and become more present. And that's… At the end of the day, positive psychology again is about helping people recognize their potential. And how can we recognize our potential if we are just running from one thing to the next, to the next, right? So mindfulness is a strategy that can help us slow down to recognize. Okay, what is going on with me in this movement that I can celebrate or find a way to work around in order to be more satisfied. Does that answer of your question? 

00:22:55
UNKNOWN Yes. Great example. 

00:22:55
REBECCA E. MICHEL Okay. Yes. 

00:22:55
UNKNOWN I have a question. 

00:22:55
REBECCA E. MICHEL Yes. 

00:23:00
UNKNOWN How can you integrate positive psychology with cognitive behavioral disorder? Sorry, therapy. 

00:23:05
REBECCA E. MICHEL No. Yep, good question. So that's one of the neat things is that positive psychology again is not meant to replace traditional psychotherapy by any means. It's really meant, as I mentioned before to compliment it. So positive psychology can be incorporated into most any theories. So for example, with CBT, or even with REBT, or other types of therapies that really focus on thoughts, right? Any of these, umm… that a strategy would be cognitive restructuring, for example. So when you're working a client who has, umm… you've, you've identified some irrational or unhelpful thoughts maybe, umm… and you recognize that those are linked to their behaviors, right? Umm… the typical traditional psychotherapy view would be how do we identify those irrational thoughts in order to eliminate them, right? So you can still keep doing that and then the positive psychology approach allows you to balance that view out. So we look at how can we look to identify positive thoughts? What is going well and how can we increase that? So rather than only decreasing the negative or the irrational thoughts, we also increase the thoughts that are flourishing to us, the thoughts that give us energy. And so you can see it's kind of like the Ying and the Yang. Instead of only focusing on the negative and decreasing the negative, we also focus on what's going while the positive and talk about increasing that. Does that make sense? 

00:24:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:24:45
REBECCA E. MICHEL Okay. Any other questions? 

00:24:45
UNKNOWN Yes, Dr. Michel. You briefly mentioned forgiveness. Could you tell us a little more about the parted place and positive psychology? 

00:24:55
REBECCA E. MICHEL Yes, absolutely. So with forgiveness. Forgiveness is an area that actually some counseling researchers have begun to study a bit more because again, this is an individual trait within positive psychology, umm… and this is an area that can be enhanced. So there was a saying by, umm… it's being according to Buddha, that holding onto anger is like grasping onto a hot coal with the intent of throwing it, but instead you're the one who gets burned, right? And so I love that image because it… and there is lots of analogies and stories like that, but essentially it's you're holding onto the anger and it's really hurting you, it's not hurting the other person. And so we know, that forgiveness, umm… is essential and it's one strategy to being essential for letting go of some of that resentment. We also know that forgiveness is really, really hard. And for people who have wronged us, for people who have shamed us, for people who have taken advantage of us, it's not easy to let go of, of that. I mean, think of… In your own lives, right? I mean, forgiveness is hard, especially when you have been truly, deeply wounded by someone, especially someone you care about. And so, however, you know, researchers found that when people are able to forgive, then they are able to experience more positive emotion. So when you're able to increase empathy, for example, increase compassion, you can start thinking about the situation not only in your own terms. So you can feel empathetic for that person who actually wronged you, right? And so researchers are finding that there is lots of brief counseling interventions that can be done to increase forgiveness. And many of these can be group based, also working with individuals, letting go of the power that that person is really holding over you, but when you're not forgiving them. And so, forgiveness again, there is a lot… This is beyond the scope kind of over this presentation, but I could truly talk for probably 45 more minutes about forgiveness. Umm… and essentially I'd encourage you to look about how can we increase forgiveness, in order to increase those positive emotions, and then decrease the physical ailments that come along with that, decrease the stress, decrease the anxiety, and really drop that hot coal, so that nobody is being burnt by that. Okay, all right. Does anybody else have questions? 

00:27:40
UNKNOWN Dr. Michel, can you please give us some more insight on the concept of flow? 

00:27:40
REBECCA E. MICHEL Flow is one of my favorite things to talk about because it's so unique and it's, it's an experience that if you've had it, you know it. Because again, just a reiterate, what it is, is it's the feeling that you are present in the moment and you are… You have let go of everything else that's going on around you. You are so focused on what's going on that you truly don't even notice what, what is occurring in the world. And so, umm… chick said me, hi(ph) is one of the people who really identified and brought to life this concept of flow. And one example that Dr. Goman offers in one of his most recent books on focus is that there was a surgeon, uh, for example, who was working on a surgery. And this was a really tough surgery. And it was challenging and yet, he had the skills to be able to meet that challenge. And so he is working on that surgery and he gets finished. And he looks around, the surgery went great. And he looks around and he sees a little pile of rubble on the floor. And he asks one of the nurses, you know what's that, you know, this is a surgery room. And the nurse said, the sealing literally caved in while you were doing the surgery. And this surgeon had no idea that that had happened because that surgeon was just so in flow that they had tuned out everything going on around them. And you… Again, you can see that kind of with example of the Olympic Athlete that I mentioned earlier. And so with flow, flow is an experience that can be cultivated in people. And in order to do that, you need to have and developed appropriate self-awareness. And so when you know what you do well, then you can set yourself up for success by putting yourself in situations to allow yourself to utilize your strengths, all right? So you know what you do well, you have good self-awareness. You've talk to other people about what you do well. And you know yourself. And then you put yourself in situations where you can excel. And so again, for that surgeon, for that athlete, for students even, you find opportunities to be able to match your skills and your ability levels, right, with the challenge at hand. And at the end of the day, when you can get to the sweet spot of when challenges meet your skills and your expertise, when it's an interesting to you, it's not boring, then your chances of experiencing flow are much greater. And I don't know if any of you have experienced flow. Can you raise your hand if you think you may have experienced flow before? Okay, so, so maybe, maybe, maybe everyone. But for me, you know, it feels I have experienced flow when teaching honestly, umm… many, many times when teaching. And I've experienced flow, I was, umm… an athlete, I've experienced flow when I'm playing in the game, right? I've experienced flow on stage as an actress. And so depending on your circumstances and, you know, the different settings that you work in. When you have the skills and abilities and self-awareness to match the challenge at hand, you can experience flow. And let me tell you, it feels great. So hopefully, that answers your question a bit about flow. All right. Any other questions? Okay. Well, thank you so much for your time this morning.
