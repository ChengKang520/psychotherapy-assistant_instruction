DIAGNOSING MENTAL DISORDERS 

00:00:05
DSM-5 AND ICD-10 

00:00:05
PARAPHILIC DISORDERS 

00:00:15
SEAN HARRIGAN Sexual interest is something most people begin to experience in early adolescence. Learning about one's feelings and attractions is part of growing up. For many people these sexual feelings will manifest themselves into sexual activity with a consenting adult. However, for some individuals, these interest may fall outside the parameters of cultural norms or what is considered socially acceptable to others. This could involve sexual desires or behaviors toward inanimate objects or animals, those that entail humiliation or punishment or even those that are directed toward non-consenting individuals, such as children. When certain of these desires are acted upon or when they cause significant distress to an individual, then that person maybe dealing with a paraphilic disorder. 

00:01:05
DSM-5 AND ICD-10 CODING 

00:01:10
DSM-5 

00:01:10
SEAN HARRIGAN The chapter on Paraphilic disorders in the 5th edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders or DSM-5 contains a number of distinct disorders. Each given its own diagnostic code. These codes crosswalk to the codes used by the World Health Organization in the international classification of diseases or ICD. In DSM-5, each disorder is linked to the coding system from ICD-9 with codes from ICD-10 listed in parenthesis. For example, voyeuristic disorder is assigned a code 302.82 from ICD-9 and (F65.3) in parenthesis from ICD-10. This is because the ICD-9 system was still in use when DSM-5 was first released. ICD-10 was released in the fall of 2015 in the United States. Although, it was adopted previously in other countries. However, because ICD-10 is now the standard in the United States, this program will be listing the newer code from ICD-10 first, followed by the ICD-9 codes in parenthesis. Sometimes, when relevant we will also delineate the ICD-9 and 10 codes when we mention a disorder from one of the other chapters of DSM-5. For example, conduct disorder in childhood onset type mentioned later in this program is coded as F91.1, (312.81). Part of the F90 to F98 section of ICD-10 on behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence. The Paraphilic disorders are all included in F60 to F69. ICD-10's block on disorders of adult personality and behavior. This points to some of the underlying traits of these disorders. In that they tend to be persistent and are the expression of an individual's characteristic lifestyle and mood of relating to self and others. Specifically the Paraphilic disorders are all included in F65, paraphilias, which is late out quite similarly to the chapter in DSM-5. This may indicate the clear separation of these disorders due to their shared characteristic of sexual interest. Transvestic disorder is called transvestic fetishes in ICD-10 which points to one of the specifiers of transvestic disorder with fetism. Sexual masochism disorder and sexual sadism disorder are grouped together in ICD-10 under the heading sadomasochism. This may highlight the increased likelihood of the two disorders to be comorbid. However, ICD-10 also includes a separate code for sadomasochism unspecified. Frotteuristic disorder is listed under the subheading of other paraphilias in ICD-10 along with other disorders not specifically coded in DSM-5 such as necrophilia. Paraphilic disorders are to be distinguished from paraphilias. Paraphilias indicate sexual interest outside normal phallic conventions. While Paraphilic disorders are more precisely delineated. They require that the individual has acted on these feelings, has experienced distress from these feelings or caused harm to others in the attempt to satisfy these feelings. In the absence of these traits, the individual may simply be experiencing a paraphilia. While many Paraphilic disorders may exist, the eight that are specifically included in DSM-5 are particularly prevalent and have the potential to result in unlawful behavior if acted upon. These eight disorders are diagnosed after the person has experienced them for a period of at least six months. 

00:05:00
VOYEURISTIC DISORDER 

00:05:05
SEAN HARRIGAN Voyeuristic disorder is characterized by experiencing sexual arousal when watching an unaware person who is undressing, nude or engaging in sexual activity. As is the case for all of the Paraphilic disorders, the individual has either caused harm to others by attempting to act on these urges or is experiencing clinically significant distress due to these urges. The clinician may choose to specify, if the individual is experiencing these urges in a controlled environment, such as a prison, hospital or other environment where voyeuristic opportunities are scarce. Additionally the clinician may specify that the patient is in full remission. If the patient has not met the full requirements of the disorder, for five years in an uncontrolled environment, for example a community. For some, in full remission may indicate simply a cessation of acting on the impulses with non-consenting individuals or cessation of distress or impairment related to the sexual impulses. Not a sensation of the impulses themselves. These two specifiers maybe applied to each of the other Paraphilic disorders with the except of pedophilic disorder. 

00:06:20
VOYEURISTIC DISORDER 

00:06:20
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS 

00:06:25
SEAN HARRIGAN Both conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder include rule breaking behavior. But do not entail the same voyeuristic behavior. Though conduct disorder may have a for sexual activity component. While it is certainly a breach of social decorum finding pleasure in acts of voyeurism is specific enough to you separate it from other types of rule breaking behavior. 

00:06:50
EXHIBITIONISTIC DISORDER 

00:06:55
SEAN HARRIGAN Individuals who are diagnosed with exhibitionist disorder have experienced repeated episodes of arousal due to exposing their genitals to unwitting bystanders. The clinician may decide to specify whether the individual is sexually aroused by exposing genitals to prepubertal children. Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to physically mature individuals or sexually aroused by exposing genital to prepubertal children and to physically mature individuals. It is estimated that upto 4% of males experience exhibitionist disorder while the prevalence for females has not been estimated. It is expected to be much lower than males. 

00:07:40
FROTTEURISTIC DISORDER 

00:07:45
SEAN HARRIGAN Frotteuristic Disorder is characterized by repeated episodes of acute sexual arousal from rubbing or touching another person without consent. Individuals with these disorder have either acted on these feelings or have experienced extreme distress or impairment in important areas of functioning as a result of them. 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN It's just so humiliating. I didn't know, you know, what I did. I didn't encourage it. What can you do in that kind of situation? 

00:08:20
SEAN HARRIGAN As with many of the Paraphilic disorders, much of the evidence for diagnosis is obtained from self-report. However some individuals repeatedly deny any Paraphilic urges. When this is the case, evidence of acting upon Paraphilic urges maybe considered proof regardless of the individual's self-report. 

00:08:40
SEXUAL MASOCHISM DISORDER 

00:08:45
SEAN HARRIGAN Sexual masochism disorder is characterized by repeated extreme sexual arousal due to being degraded, beaten, tied up or made to suffer. Individuals may openly acknowledge their sexual arousal from such impulses. But if there were no associated distress, impairment or harm to others as a result, then it could be considered masochistic sexual interest rather than Sexual masochism disorder. The clinician may specify if the individual uses restriction of breathing as a means to achieving sexual arousal by noting the specifiers with asphyxiophilia. This could lead to accidental death for individuals who engage in this behavior. 

00:09:30
SEXUAL SADISM DISORDER 

00:09:35
SEAN HARRIGAN Those with Sexual sadism disorder experience intense sexual arousal from the suffering of others. Whether physical or psychological. These individuals have either tried to satisfy these urges with another person without their consent or they have experience intense distress or impairment in functioning due to feeling these urges. The estimated prevalence of Sexual sadism disorder varies widely. Some studies estimate under 21% of hospitalize section offenders have the disorder while others estimate the prevalence to be up to 75% in those who have committed sexually motivated homicides. 

00:10:10
PEDOPHILIC DISORDER 

00:10:15
SEAN HARRIGAN Pedophilic disorder is characterized by sexual arousal. Be that feelings, fantasies or actual actions involving sexual acts with a prepubescent child. Usually under the age of 13. Individuals with Pedophilic disorder are at least 16 years old and the child or children in question are at least 5 years younger than the individual. This disorder does not include older teenagers who are involved in ongoing relationships with 12 or 13 year olds. Viewers should note that some individuals might freely admit that they feel sexual interest in children but if these individuals experience no distress or social issues and their self-report and record indicates a lack of acting on these feelings, then they may have pedophilic sexual interests rather than Pedophilic disorder. The clinician may specify whether individuals with these disorder are exclusive type, only attracted to children or non-exclusive type. They may also specify whether they are sexually attracted to males, females or both. There is also the additional specifiers of limited to incest. The specifiers in a controlled environment and in full remission do not apply to pedophilia as it appears to be a lifelong condition. However, some individuals may not meet the six month durational element of this disorder if the arousal is more of a temporary fleeting attraction. 

00:11:40
FETISHISTIC DISORDER 

00:11:45
UNKNOWN Thank you for seeing me. Uh, I've been wanting to talk to somebody about this and I can't really open up to anybody around me, it feels like. Um, especially like my family. I feel like none of them have come through anything like this and my family, my friends, none of them can be in this situation that I am, I feel like. So, it's really hard for me to open up about my feeling and what I'm going through. 

00:12:25
SEAN HARRIGAN Individuals with fetishistic disorder experience repeated sexual arousal from either non-genital body parts or non-living objects. And these feelings cause the individual to stress or impairment in functioning. In order to diagnose the fetish object must not be limited to devices designed for sexual use, as these are considered part of normaphillic behavior. They must also not be limited to clothing used for cross dressing which suggest transvestic disorder. The clinician may specify the focus of the fetish. Whether body parts, non-living objects or other. Fetishes may develop before reaching puberty which is earlier than the general onset of other paraphilias. Fetishistic disorder occurs almost exclusively in males. 

00:13:10
TRANSVESTIC DISORDER 

00:13:15
SEAN HARRIGAN Transvestic disorder is characterized by repeated intense sexual arousal from cross dressing and subsequent distress or impairment. The clinician may specify if the Transvestic disorder is experienced with fetism if the individual is aroused by certain clothing or materials or if it is experienced with autogynephilia. If the individual is aroused by the idea of being a female. However, transvestic fetism is not the same as gender disphoria. In transvestic fetism individuals are aroused by the cross dressing behavior or the idea of being a female but do not feel that they should be of a gender different from their assigned birth gender. In transvestic fetism, the feelings are tied to the arousal rather than to a pervasive wish to change genders. Transvestic disorders highly (inaudible )with other paraphilias. Particularly fetism as indicated by the specifiers. 

00:14:15
OTHER SPECIFIED PARAPHILIC DISORDER 

00:14:20
SEAN HARRIGAN The Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder category is used when the clinician decides to disclose the reason why a patient does not meet one of the other Paraphilic disorders. The individual may either not meet the full characteristics from one of the disorders or they may experience another type of intense sexual arousal due to one of the following. Necrophilia, dead bodies, Zoophilia, animals, telephones (inaudible ) phone calls of an obscene nature, (inaudible )excrement or urophilia, urine. 

00:14:55
UNSPECIFIED PARAPHILIC DISORDER 

00:15:00
SEAN HARRIGAN This category is used to classify instances in which there is either not enough information to specify the Paraphilic disorder or the clinician chooses not to specify where the individual does not meet the requirements for another Paraphilic disorder. Diagnosis of a Paraphilic disorder maybe prompted by the individual experiencing distress or by a Paraphilic event, carried out on an unwilling victim. While these disorders can be especially upsetting given the danger that they may cause to not only the individual with the disorder but also potentially those around them diagnosis of these disorders can potentially offer the first step in the treatment process. Treatment may include group therapy, psychotherapy, and even pharmaco therapy depending on the particular Paraphilic disorder. Options that may put the patient on a path towards living happier, more contended lives.
