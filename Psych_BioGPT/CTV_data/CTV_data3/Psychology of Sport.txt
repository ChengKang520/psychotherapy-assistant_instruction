Psychology of Sport Dr. Arnold LeUnes, Ed.D. Author of "Sport Psychology" Prof. of Psychology, Texas A&M Univ. 

00:01:10
DR. ARNOLD LEUNES The psychology of sport is basically the application of, ah, fundamental principles of psychology to sport and exercise. 

00:01:20
Dr. Diane L. Gill, Ph.D. Prof. of Kinesiology, UNC, Greensboro 

00:01:20
DR. DIANE L. GILL Sport psychology is about understanding people and their behavior in sport context. 

00:01:25
Dr. Daniel R. Gould, Ph.D. Director, Inst. for the Study of Youth Sports Prof. of Applied Sport Psychology, MSU 

00:01:25
UNKNOWN I think it's important because sport is such pervasive phenomena in our culture. 

00:01:30
Dr. James E. Loehr, Ed.D. Co-Founder, Human Performance Inst. 

00:01:30
DR. JAMES E. LOEHR It's the study of human performance and human performance is, is in every aspect of our lives. 

00:01:35
Dr. Kate F. Hays, Ph.D., CC-AASP Director, The Performing Edge Author of "Move Your Body, Tone Your Mood" 

00:01:35
DR. KATE F. HAYS Sport participation actually can teach us a whole about ourselves. 

00:01:40
Dr. Gloria Balague, Ph.D. Prof. of Psychology, UIC Pres. Elect of APA Div 47 

00:01:40
DR. GLORIA BALAGUE The ultimate goal of sport psychology is not just to increase performance, ah, no matter what, ah, to increase the functioning of this person in a performance environment. 

00:01:55
Dr. Keith Bell, Ph.D. Sport Psychologist Author of "76 Rules for Outperforming the Competition" and "Winning Isn't Normal" 

00:01:55
DR. KEITH BELL I'm in the business of, uhm, helping people perform better, helping people and teams and coaches win and helping them enjoy it more. 

00:02:00
Dr. Judy Van Raalte, Ph.D. Prof. of Psychology, Springfield College 

00:02:00
DR. JUDY VAN RAALTE I think our goal is to keep as many people involved and participating and enjoying sport and exercise as possible. 

00:02:10
Dr. Steve Portenga, Ph.D. Dir. of Sport Psychology, Univ. of Denver Chair, Sport Psychology, USA Track & Field 

00:02:10
DR. STEVE PORTENGA We know that the mind controls the body and it controls what gets in, how efficiently it gets in and what gets out consistently. And so we have to have a mind at the right place for the body to be able to do what we've trained it to do. 

00:02:20
Dr. Michael L. Sachs, Ph.D. Prof. of Kinesiology, Temple Univ. Former President of AASP & APA Div 47 

00:02:20
DR. MICHAEL L. SACHS What separates the champions from the, the second and third place is often the psychological factors. 

00:02:25
Dr. Karen Cogan, Ph.D. Sport Psychologist for the USOC 

00:02:25
DR. KAREN COGAN And it really is who is on, who is mentally tough, who is focused, who is able to tuned up with distractions, that's the person that's gonna win that day. 

00:02:35
Dr. Kay Porter, Ph.D. Author of "The Mental Athlete" Certified Sport Psychology Consultant 

00:02:35
DR. KAY PORTER It seems to me what the zone is is people being totally concentrated and focused on what they're doing. 

00:02:40
Dr. Wendy Borlabi, Psy.D. Senior Sport Psychologist for the USOC 

00:02:40
DR. WENDY BORLABI I feel when athletes in a game is just as important if not more actually than they're out of game. 

00:02:45
Dr. Damon Burton, Ph.D. Prof. of HPERD, Univ. of Idaho 

00:02:45
DR. DAMON BURTON The middle stuff that often doesn't get factored in by the experts, ah, can totally change the nature of the competition. 

00:02:55
The Growth & Development of Sport Psychology Coleman Griffith 1893 -- 1966 Dr. Arnold LeUnes, Ed.D. Author of "Sport Psychology" Prof. of Psychology, Texas A&M Univ. Founded in 1986, the Association for Applied Sport Psychology (AASP) promotes the ethical practice, science, and advocacy of sport and exercise psychology Also founded in 1986, Division 47 of the APA represents the field of sport and exercise psychology 

00:03:00
DR. ARNOLD LEUNES In 1920, 1925, ah, Coleman Griffith at the University of Illinois started the first sport psychology laboratory. He's called the father of sports psychology. He wrote a couple of books on sports psychology and then, ah, for whatever reasons he got out of sport psychology and from about 1930 to about 1960 not really very much happened. And then, ah, sport psychology started taking on some significance, ah, a group of physical educators got together in Dallas in 1967 and, ah, created essential the first sport psychology organization, professional organization. Twenty years later, ah, that groups splintered and we had the Association for The Advancement of Applied Sport Psychology created and also, ah, the American Psychological Association has a division, division 47 for sport and exercise psychology and those two organizations pretty dictate training, ethics and various other things for the fields today. 

00:04:05
Dr. Kate F. Hays, Ph.D., CC-AASP Director, The Performing Edge Author of "Move Your Body, Tone Your Mood" 

00:04:05
DR. KATE F. HAYS These organizations have been able to help make sport and exercise psychology more visible and have also, ah, really added an element of standards, ah, certification within AASP for the development of, ah, proficiency in sport psychology within APA. 

00:04:25
Dr. Arnold LeUnes, Ed.D. Author of "Sport Psychology" Prof. of Psychology, Texas A&M Univ. 

00:04:25
DR. ARNOLD LEUNES Those people have promoted sport psychology, they have, uhm, got it in front of Congress, they got it in front of professional athletes, they've set training standards, mentoring standards. 

00:04:35
Dr. Daniel R. Gould, Ph.D. Director, Inst. for the Study of Youth Sports Prof. of Applied Sport Psychology, MSU 

00:04:35
DR. DANIEL R. GOULD The field that what we historically called physical education then sport science and probably today kinesiology, ah, I think is a backbone in North America modern sport psychology. 

00:04:45
Dr. Damon Burton, Ph.D. Prof. of HPERD, Univ. of Idaho 

00:04:50
DR. DAMON BURTON Clearly, the roots of our field came out of kinesiology. 

00:04:50
Dr. Diane L. Gill, Ph.D. Prof. of Kinesiology, UNC, Greensboro 

00:04:50
DR. DIANE L. GILL And in the last, ah, 20 years it's also become more prominent within psychology and it's a mix of fields. 

00:05:00
Dr. Kate F. Hays, Ph.D., CC-AASP Director, The Performing Edge Author of "Move Your Body, Tone Your Mood" Licensing laws require an individual to meet specific educational, experiential, and testing requirements before a license to practice psychology is granted 

00:05:00
DR. KATE F. HAYS One of the complexities of the practice of sport psychology is in, in the title itself because psychology, psychologists, psychological are often protected terms at, ah, state or provincial level. 

00:05:20
DR. ARNOLD LEUNES Even today, probably, 90% of the sport psychology programs in this country our housed in kinesiology departments and yet there's this requirement that you have a psychology license to call yourself one. 

00:05:30
Dr. Damon Burton, Ph.D. Prof. of HPERD, Univ. of Idaho 

00:05:30
DR. DAMON BURTON Psychology just didn't see sport as a relevant topic, ah, for a long time and, ah, whereas in kinesiology we did. 

00:05:40
Dr. Diane L. Gill, Ph.D. Prof. of Kinesiology, UNC, Greensboro 

00:05:40
DR. DIANE L. GILL We can understand things about exercise physiology, exercise prescription but when it comes down to working with the people in sport or exercise context, it's about people and behavior. So that's increased the interest in psychology in that sense. 

00:05:55
Dr. Kay Porter, Ph.D. Author of "The Mental Athlete" Certified Sport Psychology Consultant 

00:05:55
DR. KAY PORTER Although it's an eclectic field, it still has a place for, uhm, pretty heavy duty clinical applications. 

00:06:05
Dr. Wendy Borlabi, Psy.D. Senior Sport Psychologist for the USOC 

00:06:05
DR. WENDY BORLABI I think one of the, the huge benefits for sports psychology is the addition of the clinical piece, uhm, seeing that working with an athlete is not just performance that there is and other part of it. And so being able to bring those together so you work an athlete with performance and also just their everyday life. 

00:06:25
Dr. Judy Van Raalte, Ph.D. Prof. of Psychology, Springfield College 

00:06:25
DR. JUDY VAN RAALTE My approach involves really listening and working closely in a relationship with the athlete. Sometimes it is a performance issue and we work on how to become more confident, sometimes is a broader life issue. 

00:06:35
Dr. Michael L. Sachs, Ph.D. Prof. of Kinesiology, Temple Univ. Former President of AASP & APA Div 47 

00:06:35
DR. MICHAEL L. SACHS Ah, the clinical sport psychology say(ph) and encompasses dealing with counseling or clinical issues and those can be things like anxiety, depression, eating disorders, substance abuse, ah, and there are-- those often get in the way or compromise our ability to perform at our best. 

00:06:50
Dr. Steve Portenga, Ph.D. Dir. of Sport Psychology, Univ. of Denver Chair, Sport Psychology, USA Track & Field 

00:06:50
DR. STEVE PORTENGA Sport psychology really is a subset of performance psychology and it's really looking at human performance and how the mind controls the body in those situations to be able to perform at our best. 

00:07:00
Dr. Michael L. Sachs, Ph.D. Prof. of Kinesiology, Temple Univ. Former President of AASP & APA Div 47 

00:07:00
DR. MICHAEL L. SACHS The idea is working with any individual who's in a, ah, a-- an activity, a field where performances required, ah, at a given moment over a certain period of time. 

00:07:10
Dr. Amy Athey, Psy.D. Sport Psychologist, Univ. of Oregon 

00:07:10
DR. AMY ATHEY If we could make this distinction of this is a clinical issue versus performance which quite frankly I find it sometimes hard to do that. 

00:07:20
Dr. Damon Burton, Ph.D. Prof. of HPERD, Univ. of Idaho 

00:07:20
DR. DAMON BURTON What we are beginning to see today is, uhm, more, ah, universities are adopting training models that incorporate the two. 

00:07:30
Dr. Steve Portenga, Ph.D. Dir. of Sport Psychology, Univ. of Denver Chair, Sport Psychology, USA Track & Field 

00:07:30
DR. STEVE PORTENGA I think we're seeing more and more folk really focused on general psychology training and the sport science training and really do having a-- integrated background, really understanding the whole person but also really understanding performance and understanding the body from our control standpoints. 

00:07:45
DR. ARNOLD LEUNES Some of the events that had the most impact on sport psychology include the, ah, creation of organizations for kids - boy scouts, girl scouts, YMCA, YWCA, little league baseball - those things came together to create, ah, kind of a domain of, ah, sport psychology devoted to youth. 

00:08:10
Dr. Gloria Balague, Ph.D. Prof. of Psychology, UIC Pres. Elect of APA Div 47 

00:08:10
DR. GLORIA BALAGUE I think the growth of sport psychology is tied to the growth of psychology and, of course, to the growth of sports. 

00:08:15
Dr. Jack J. Lesyk, Ph.D. CC-AASP Director, Ohio Ctr. for Sport Psychology 

00:08:15
DR. JACK J. LESYK As the years have gone by, we see more and more prominent athletes speaking very openly about working with sports psychologist. 

00:08:20
Dr. Karen Cogan, Ph.D. Sport Psychologist for the USOC 

00:08:20
DR. KAREN COGAN Every Olympics you hear more and more about the mental side of training, athletes talk about using a sport psychologist. 

00:08:30
Dr. Jack J. Lesyk, Ph.D. CC-AASP Director, Ohio Ctr. for Sport Psychology 

00:08:30
DR. JACK J. LESYK We're getting public relations out there, we're making the public more aware of just what sport psychology does for people. 

00:08:35
Dr. Daniel R. Gould, Ph.D. Director, Inst. for the Study of Youth Sports Prof. of Applied Sport Psychology, MSU 

00:08:35
DR. DANIEL R. GOULD Athlete sometimes have a stigma against there's something wrong with me so the way we approach it many times is it's like strength training for your head versus surgery for your head. 

00:08:50
Dr. Amy Athey, Psy.D. Sport Psychologist, Univ. of Oregon 

00:08:50
DR. AMY ATHEY One advantage that sport psychologist do have is that we can talk about performance. 

00:08:55
Dr. Jack J. Lesyk, Ph.D. CC-AASP Director, Ohio Ctr. for Sport Psychology 

00:08:55
DR. JACK J. LESYK Sport psychology is not just for troubled athletes but it utilize educational service that can help all athletes get close to their potential. 

00:09:05
Sport Psychology Applications & Techniques 

00:09:10
DR. ARNOLD LEUNES Some of the basic applications of sport psychology include, ah, counseling, ah, counseling with athletes who have problems, counseling perhaps with coaches, ah, occasionally. 

00:09:20
Dr. Amy Athey, Psy.D. Sport Psychologist, Univ. of Oregon 

00:09:20
DR. AMY ATHEY Ah, in general the services that I provide are individual student athlete consultations, uhm, that could take on more of a therapy nature if it's a clinical need. 

00:09:30
Social Cognitive Models represent a blend of social psychological and cognitive psychological theories These models emphasize the role of self-efficiency, mastery, and goal achievement in explaining behavior 

00:09:30
DR. DIANE L. GILL Just about any model that's used in psychology in any context is used in sport psychology. Ah, certainly all the motivation, kind of models and theories are relevant. Uhm, for example, probably the more common ones used are the social cognitive models of motivation that are also used in a range of things and particular in relation to health behaviors. Those same models are, are used in sport and exercise psychology. 

00:10:00
Behavioral psychology, also known as behaviorism, is based on the idea that all behaviors are acquired through conditioning 

00:10:00
DR. ARNOLD LEUNES There are numbers of schools that thought about psychology probably at least six - the psychoanalytic, the humanistic, the behavioral, the cognitive, the sociocultural and the biophysical or biological - and they've all had, ah, a lot of impact on the field but two that have had a lot of, ah, influence on the way that sport psychology developed over the years are the behavioral and the cognitive models. 

00:10:20
Cognitive theories of psychology are focused on internal states, such as motivation, problem solving, decision-making, thinking, and attention 

00:10:25
DR. AMY ATHEY I certainly for a more treatment-oriented case, I do draw up on, uhm, cognitive-behavioral theory, uhm, and the personal theory and, and, and understanding on how we can best help this person, regain their normal functioning. Uhm, with performance though, I also draw up on cognitive-behavioral theory a great deal. 

00:10:40
Behavioral theories have been advocated by famous psychologists such as John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner Behavioral techniques are often used in therapeutic, sport, and performance settings to help clients learn new skills and behaviors 

00:10:40
DR. ARNOLD LEUNES Much of what is done in the applied area in sport psychology today is a functional dismarriage(ph) of behavioral and cognitive approaches. The behavioral model, ah, with its emphasis on reinforcement and punishment, ah, has been huge in both practice and research. 

00:11:00
DR. KATE F. HAYS There are a number of common mental skills or psychological skills techniques that sport psychologist use in order to, to foster peak performance. 

00:11:10
Goal Setting Characteristics of a well formed goal: - Specific - Measurable - Action Oriented - Realistic - Time-Bound 

00:11:10
DR. MICHAEL L. SACHS It starts with SMART goals, ah, specific, measurable, ah, action oriented, realistic, and time-bound. 

00:11:15
DR. WENDY BORLABI Goal setting absolutely helps them excellent performance cuz it gives you focus. 

00:11:20
Dr. Keith Bell, Ph.D. Sport Psychologist Author of "76 Rules for Outperforming the Competition" and "Winning Isn't Normal" 

00:11:20
DR. KEITH BELL Goals must be, in my opinion, must be consistent with your mission. If you're not setting goals consistent with your mission, you're gonna get off track. 

00:11:30
DR. AMY ATHEY In helping student athletes maximize their performance, I, uhm, really, first, just wanna hear from them what are their goals. Like what are they looking to achieve. 

00:11:40
Dr. Keith Bell, Ph.D. Sport Psychologist Author of "76 Rules for Outperforming the Competition" and "Winning Isn't Normal" 

00:11:40
DR. KEITH BELL One of the skills that I, ah, is really important for athletes to develop is good cognitive techniques, good thinking skills, and good thought control. 

00:11:50
Albert Bandura 1925--Present Dr. Bandura is known as one of the originators of Social Learning theory and Self-Efficacy theory Self-Efficacy theory holds that success or failure depends on a person's beliefs about his or her own ability and the likelihood that a given behavior will lead to a specific outcome 

00:11:50
DR. DIANE L. GILL I particularly like, ah, social cognitive theory in Bandura's work and stemming from original self-efficacy theory and I think that's a great theory that's very applicable to sport and exercise. It's kind of the basic story, the little engine that could, you know, if a-- if-- I think I can, I think I can, and the little engine does it and that's the essence of self-efficacy theory that if you think you can, you can. 

00:12:20
DR. AMY ATHEY As you think so shall it be and so, you know, where we're, we're putting our energies and how we're conceptualizing what we're gonna be able to do, uhm, ourselves, others, the situation, uhm, often kinda dictates where we end up. 

00:12:35
DR. DIANE L. GILL Our thoughts or our beliefs that we can do something are strong predictors of behavior. 

00:12:40
Dr. Wendy Borlabi, Psy.D. Senior Sport Psychologist for the USOC 

00:12:40
DR. WENDY BORLABI We're always saying things to ourselves and so negative self-talk definitely has a huge impact on us in how we go through the day. 

00:12:45
Cognitive restructuring is the process of learning to refute cognitive distortions, with the goal of replacing one's counter-productive beliefs with more accurate and beneficial ones 

00:12:45
DR. KEITH BELL We utilize the technique called cognitive restructuring and, uhm, teach athletes to fill their heads with thoughts that are promotive of performance. 

00:12:55
DR. DIANE L. GILL The best to build self-efficacy and self-confidence is some success, some positive experiences. 

00:13:00
Dr. James E. Loehr, Ed.D. Co-Founder, Human Performance Inst. 

00:13:00
DR. JAMES E. LOEHR We have been looking at tapes, watching videos of their performances. 

00:13:05
DR. JACK J. LESYK We try to turn every single competition into a learning experience and so after every competition I had them ask themselves and sometimes write it down four questions. After the competition, what did you do really well? Question number two, what did you do not so well? Question number three, what did you learn? And question number four, how can you use this to improve? 

00:13:30
Dr. James E. Loehr, Ed.D. Co-Founder, Human Performance Inst. 

00:13:30
DR. JAMES E. LOEHR The most powerful tool we have for getting people to actually get their thinking and to capture that private voice to recruit it and get it align with what you want is handwriting. There's something almost magical about the connection between the hand and the prefrontal cortex. 

00:13:50
DR. KEITH BELL Sport psychology has to do, in my mind, has a lot to do with teaching skills and there are variety of skills that I think help people perform better - decision-making skills, uhm, relaxation training, uhm, some people do a fair amount of imagery work, uhm, visualization. 

00:14:10
Dr. Kay Porter, Ph.D. Author of "The Mental Athlete" Certified Sport Psychology Consultant 

00:14:10
DR. KAY PORTER I think that imagery and visualization is one of the most important things that an athlete uses. 

00:14:15
DR. DIANE L. GILL It can be used for relaxation, emotional control, it can be used to practice attention, concentration skills, uhm, range of things and it can be used to practice specific physical skills, strategies, boost your mind making a game. 

00:14:35
DR. KAY PORTER We do visualization and imagery all the time, we're just not aware of it. 

00:14:35
DR. MICHAEL L. SACHS There's a limit to the amount of physical preparation that you can put in and you can only spend a certain number of hours on the, on the court, in the pool and so. But you can spend a great deal of extra time doing what we call mental practice. 

00:14:50
DR. KAY PORTER The imagery really, uhm, not only is just seeing. It is also feeling and hearing. 

00:14:55
Dr. Karen Cogan, Ph.D. Sport Psychologist for the USOC 

00:14:55
DR. KAREN COGAN I often tell athletes that you take your head everywhere you go so you can always be mentally training. 

00:15:00
DR. DIANE L. GILL One of, ah, the best, most effective, the easiest exercise to do is simply deep breathing. 

00:15:10
UNKNOWN Meditation techniques, mindfulness techniques, ah, breathing techniques, yoga, ah, are being used more and more. 

00:15:15
DR. KAREN COGAN When I'm talking to athletes about using mental skills and especially imagery, uhm, I say, "Look, I'm not telling you that you shouldn't physical train. You still got to do the physical training but you can also add in the mental training component that's just going to improve your physical training that much more and if they're injured and they can't physical train, then they can spend more time mentally training and it keeps them in the game. 

00:15:40
Energy Psychology is the name for a broad range of psychological treatments that utilize the human energy system Rapid Eye Technology is used to help people who suffer from stress, anxiety, and a variety of emotional issues EFT is a form of alternative psychotherapy on acupuncture points while a patient focuses on a specific traumatic memory 

00:15:40
DR. KAY PORTER Energy psychology is a number of different kinds of techniques that are being used in healing and they're being now applied to sport psychology, there's different things called rapid eye technology, ah, EFT which is the emotional freedom technique. The energy psychology is used to, to focus the athlete, to refocus them and to get them to stop thinking a lot of negative things. 

00:16:10
DR. AMY ATHEY Whenever we're, we're talking about performance, we're talking about self-talk, I, I, I fall back to cognitive behavioral theory. 

00:16:15
DR. KAREN COGAN I think the cognitive behavioral technique will always be there. They are the foundation of what we do. And I think we're just having to hone those more and find ways of tweaking what we do to meet the needs of the individual athlete. 

00:16:30
DR. STEVE PORTENGA Ultimately, that's what sport psychology is, it's for you now to write interventions with this person with their particular obstacles, help them identify what that clear focus is so they have the ability to get there and to get back there when they lose focus. 

00:16:40
DR. KATE F. HAYS What we tend to specialize in actually is how to use this techniques with the particular person on a particular issue in a way that they are going to be able to understand and use. 

00:16:55
DR. JAMES E. LOEHR Any technique is, is to enhance their ability to access that very combination of natural talents and acquired skill in this moment. 

00:17:05
DR. STEVE PORTENGA Being present, being in a moment, being able to manage them all is the key performance skill. All the stuff that we do in sport psychology eventually filters down to that capacity. 

00:17:15
DR. ARNOLD LEUNES Sport psychologist can promote effectiveness in the athlete they're working with by being quite informed about a huge variety of techniques, cognitive, behavioral, visualization, self-talk, thought stoppage, ah, reframing. 

00:17:30
DR. DANIEL R. GOULD A big one that I find worked really well for athletes across sports is developing pre-performance routines, helping them figure out what their emotional temperature or what emotions they need in the levels of those emotions to perform well so they're sort of psyched up but not out or not under psyched. 

00:17:50
DR. MICHAEL L. SACHS So we would work with the individual with a variety of, ah, stress management, ah, strategies, relaxation strategies or arousing relative strategies to help the individual get into that level that we call the optimal level of arousal which is the optimal level for maximum performance that will result in you performing your best. 

00:18:10
DR. STEVE PORTENGA Ultimately, what we're trying to get the athletes to work towards is prepare in a way to develop a level of automaticity, to be able to have the right program responses in different situations from a motor movement standpoint and from a perceptual decision-making standpoint. 

00:18:20
Dr. Judy Van Raalte, Ph.D. Prof. of Psychology, Springfield College 

00:18:20
DR. JUDY VAN RAALTE More importantly than what I can do or provide for the athletes understanding them and allowing them or helping them to understand themselves gets them to where they need to be. 

00:18:35
Intrinsic Aspects of Sport Participation 

00:18:40
DR. ARNOLD LEUNES Almost all human behaviors is not singularly dictated and sport behavior is not singularly dictated. 

00:18:45
DR. KEITH BELL There are a lot of ingredients (inaudible ) to competitive performance. 

00:18:50
DR. WENDY BORLABI Motivation is definitely a huge aspect of it and so you wanna make sure that an athlete is motivated and motivated correctly. 

00:18:55
DR. DAMON BURTON Without motivation, ah, it's, it's hard to make any progress in sport. 

00:19:00
DR. KATE F. HAYS There are a number of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that tend to motivate athletes. 

00:19:05
Dr. Gloria Balague, Ph.D. Prof. of Psychology, UIC Pres. Elect of APA Div 47 

00:19:05
DR. GLORIA BALAGUE The things that provide internal, personal enjoyment, intrinsic motivation are things like learning something new, noticing that they are improving. So when the coaches pay attention to improve, ah, making effort, doing something hard, those things enhance, ah, intrinsic motivation. 

00:19:25
DR. STEVE PORTENGA It takes a tremendous amount of time and energy to develop as an athlete especially if you have aspirations of developing to an elite athlete. 

00:19:35
DR. WENDY BORLABI You have to be motivated cuz you have to go above and beyond anything that anyone's ever expected of you. 

00:19:40
DR. KEITH BELL Every athlete needs to know what his mission is and I think he needs to understand that his mission probably is to pursue excellence in his sport. 

00:19:45
Self Determination Theory is concerned with the motivation behind the choices that people make without any external influence and interference It focuses on the degree to which an individual's behavior is self-motivated and self-determined Some of the basic needs which motivate individuals are: - Being connected to others - Being competent - Connecting actions to values 

00:19:45
DR. STEVE PORTENGA I think the three basic things that really motivate people come from this idea of self-determination theory and that's our need to be connected and related to others and there's a big range in the kind of connection, we need to satisfy that need. I think there's a need to feel competent with, ah, ourselves and the world that feel like we're giving to it, we're providing some value to others. And the last thing that we know from the research is this need to have a sense of connection to our values and our ability to direct our actions. 

00:20:15
DR. DAMON BURTON Some of the factors that, uhm, impact athletes' ability to motivate themselves are focusing on the right goals for one thing. 

00:20:25
DR. STEVE PORTENGA Ultimately, what we really try to work with motivation is trying to get to a very deep level of what are some core values, what some core mean. 

00:20:35
DR. JUDY VAN RAALTE Identifying the things that motivate them and channeling that motivation in a way that's effective for that athlete is one of the most important things I can help an athlete do. 

00:20:40
DR. WENDY BORLABI I think some of the factors that typically that's gonna motivate an athlete is gonna be outsee their love for the sport, it's also gonna be a-- their, their value of that love for their sport and what I mean for that is that is it-- does that value from them or is it from somebody else. 

00:20:55
DR. JAMES E. LOEHR Well, the most important thing is to get the purpose for playing right. If you don't get the purpose right, everything follows, uhm, in a dysfunctional way. 

00:21:05
DR. KEITH BELL I think a lot of people get derailed cuz they lose sight of purpose. There's nothing that helps you perform better in any given situation than understanding why you're doing it and then what you're doing and what the purpose is. 

00:21:15
DR. DAMON BURTON Mature athletes, uhm, have an understanding that the challenge is getting the most out of your ability. 

00:21:25
DR. JAMES E. LOEHR Most importantly, they are there to get better, to enjoy themselves, to grow, to learn and to improve. 

00:21:30
DR. KAREN COGAN What we work on is helping the athlete deal with the unexpected, whatever that is. You know, just so that they've have practice dealing with things going in different way and having to regroup and we focus. 

00:21:45
DR. KEITH BELL It's, ah, not the best athlete that wins, it's the best prepared athlete that wins. It's not the best or most talented team that wins, it's the most talented team that has prepared the best that wins. 

00:21:55
DR. STEVE PORTENGA The easiest way to really build confidence is to work on our physical, technical and tactical abilities. You know, we don't have these magic tricks in sport psychology and so that end ups being a paradox and what I do a lot of time is working from a psychological standpoint to really get the athletes doing their best and engage in quality practice and work on developing all of their capabilities not just their mental ability. 

00:22:20
DR. KEITH BELL Most people don't understand that it's not the enormity of effort that yields success, it's the consistency of action. It's the sum of your actions, not the enormity of your actions. 

00:22:30
DR. STEVE PORTENGA There's probably more athletes that don't get to the elite level not because they didn't have the capability but because they didn't put in effort, they didn't have the will to get there. 

00:22:40
DR. DAMON BURTON Probably the big thing between being a really good player and being a great player is just hat ability to do it over and over again. 

00:22:50
DR. STEVE PORTENGA A lot of athletes come in to my office and wanna work on confidence and my answer to that is they need to go back to practice, that they wanna be confident in their ability to do something and they haven't develop that ability to a level of consistency yet where they can really know that they're gonna do it or whether they wanna do it before they do it. 

00:23:05
DR. AMY ATHEY Confidence is critical. 

00:23:10
DR. STEVE PORTENGA Confidence really is pre-knowing that you can do something which means you have to have the right preparation to be able to do it in the first place and it also means that you have to place your confidence on a particular task, something that you can control as opposed to where most people wanna place their confidence to the outcome. 

00:23:25
DR. AMY ATHEY Some of the work that I may have been doing with a student athlete over time often focuses on the process, the things that aren't in student athlete's control. 

00:23:35
DR. KAREN COGAN What we try to do and this goes for any competition not just the Olympics, is to think less about the end result and more about staying in the present and in the moment and doing what they need to do right then to do the best performance possible. 

00:23:50
DR. DIANE L. GILL The optimal state for most athletes is the state of being in control emotionally, your emotions are under control; and cognitively, your thoughts, your attention is under control. 

00:24:05
DR. DANIEL R. GOULD I sometimes tell an athlete they need to understand their, ah, emotional temperature that, that's optimal for their performance. 

00:24:10
DR. KEITH BELL Sport psychology is really interesting in working with athletes who are involved in sports where the risk of injury and, and severe injury and maybe even death are real because they have to have a healthy respect and some healthy fear for the dangers without having fear of failure and it's a tough distinction to make. 

00:24:35
DR. DANIEL R. GOULD What we can do as sport psychologist to help athletes better cope with fear and anxiety, uhm, is always pretty specific to the type of fear and anxiety. But I think the first thing if you came in and you're anxious, the first thing I wanna do is try to pinpoint the source. 

00:24:50
DR. JUDY VAN RAALTE A lot of sport psychologists find that some of their greatest opportunities are to work with injured athletes. 

00:25:00
DR. ARNOLD LEUNES Athletes, as, ah, everybody knows, end up getting injured, ah, a great deal particularly knee injury, shoulder injury so psych rehab, ah, is taking on a great deal of importance of late. 

00:25:10
DR. KAREN COGAN If they had been at the top of their game, got injured, and are trying to come back and it has been several months, sometimes an athlete might doubt themselves as to whether they can achieve the level of performance that they had before. 

00:25:25
DR. WENDY BORLABI What happens usually is when the athlete is injured, they become pushed to the side where they're in the training room, they're going to rehab, they're seeing the doctors, they're not part of the team where the coaches ain't coaching them because they need to be rehab and so there's that disconnect. 

00:25:35
DR. AMY ATHEY Some of the rehabs are very tedious, long, hard work and, and so helping them set goals to kind of break that up to feel like they are achieving, uhm, they are moving forward even though sometimes it's hard to see 

00:25:50
DR. JUDY VAN RAALTE There are some concerns about will they ever be good enough again, is their position still available, are they really better, will they get injured again especially for athletes who have suffered from chronic overuse injuries. And so those issues can be more complicated. Does the athlete want to return to sport? Might it be better to retire now? 

00:26:10
DR. WENDY BORLABI A career-ending injury is going to affect an athlete in several different aspects. The biggest one is gonna be their identity cuz they're no longer gonna be an athlete, they're gonna be-- they get to figure out who they are. 

00:26:20
DR. DANIEL R. GOULD When, ah, careers get terminated in sport it creates some real challenges. 

00:26:25
DR. KAREN COGAN It is a completely different environment in the sport world and then when they're done with the sport and they are trying to go out to get a job or to, to fit in to the general population, the often feels very strange. I had one athlete, uh, call it being a civilian and he didn't know how to be a civilian after he had been an athlete for so long. 

00:26:50
Extrinsic & Intrinsic Aspects of Exercise It is estimated that: - Over 30% of American adults are obese - Approximately 17% of U.S. children are obese 

00:26:55
DR. ARNOLD LEUNES Over the years, we have created a culture of obesity that is almost unparallel than many parts of the world. 

00:27:00
DR. GLORIA BALAGUE We are reflecting some of the, the values of society which is a very sedentary society. 

00:27:10
DR. KATE F. HAYS Being physically active is an essential part of who we are as human beings. 

00:27:15
DR. JAMES E. LOEHR Movements and exercise is medicine and that the human species was designed to move for most of the muscle and then we have a society that is for the most part sedentary. 

00:27:25
DR. DIANE L. GILL Physical inactivity is a risk factor for all the major diseases. 

00:27:30
DR. JACK J. LESYK Heart conditions, high blood pressure, ah, diabetes. A lot have very direct relationships between lack of activity, exercise and one's physical health. 

00:27:40
DR. GLORIA BALAGUE In our society, we are going on the law of minimum effort. We (inaudible ) to the supermarket and people circle and circle to where the closest path to the door so we walk the least. 

00:27:50
DR. DANIEL R. GOULD Most people don't exercise enough. Thirty percent of people in the United States are inactive, do nothing. How do we get that couch potato off the couch? 

00:28:00
DR. KATE F. HAYS One of the pieces of how a sport psychologist can help some to be more active is actually to have them understand from inside of themselves what a difference it makes to them to be physically active. 

00:28:15
DR. GLORIA BALAGUE We work with our mind all the time, we need to keep our body physically active and we, we've lost a little bit of that connection. 

00:28:20
DR. KATE F. HAYS How our bodies are functioning is an important to our well-being as what we're just thinking about. 

00:28:30
DR. DIANE L. GILL It's almost impossible to separate out, you know, what's a mind thing, what's a body thing. 

00:28:35
DR. JUDY VAN RAALTE Everything is intertwined. It's not that we have a separate mind and a separate body but rather they're connected, the mind and the body affect each other in dramatic and important ways. When our bodies feel better, our minds feel better and when we feel better in our minds, we feel better in our bodies. 

00:28:50
DR. JAMES E. LOEHR As long as you exercise, you can stay pretty smart. We actually can create new neurons in the brain, neurogenesis and synaptogenesis as a consequence of intense physical activity. 

00:29:05
DR. JACK J. LESYK The right type of exercise reduces anxiety, reduces depression, increases feelings of self-esteem. So you can say conversely people who don't exercise are a little more likely to experience anxiety, depression and low self-esteem. 

00:29:20
DR. MICHAEL L. SACHS Exercise, physical activity are keys for the one's physical and mental health and yet not enough people, ah, participate on a regular basis. 

00:29:30
DR. GLORIA BALAGUE We know that there are, you know, noticeable benefits, you know, we have all of these public health problems with obesity, with diabetes, with heart problems and the solution rather than being a part of medications could be exercising for life. We should get to making sure that the children, uhm, learn to love and enjoy physical activity and then the chances of that being a part of their life is much higher. 

00:29:55
Extrinsic Aspects of Sport Participation 

00:30:05
DR. STEVE PORTENGA We see a lot of social values reflecting in sport in terms of how we support our athletes, what we report on, what we pay attention to, what we choose to highlight. 

00:30:15
DR. JAMES E. LOEHR Sport is a kind of a microcosm of life. It creates this kind of artificial cells of high-intensity, high importance outcomes. 

00:30:20
DR. JACK J. LESYK So whatever happens in the culture is gonna happen in support and sometimes maybe backwards, what's gonna happen in sports is gonna happen in the culture too. 

00:30:30
DR. DAMON BURTON Many of the problems that we have in sport are the same problems we have in society. 

00:30:30
DR. AMY ATHEY It can be a Petri dish, you know, you we can't see, uhm, these issues kind of magnifies. 

00:30:35
DR. GLORIA BALAGUE The sport can reflect some very positive values and sport can reflect some not so positive values. 

00:30:45
DR. STEVE PORTENGA A lot of what sports psychology is is understanding the sociology of sport, the role sport plays in our culture and being able to counter some really challenging almost kind of stupid beliefs that people have about sport. 

00:30:55
DR. DAMON BURTON When you watch sport center that's on all of the time now on, you know, three or four different channels, you know, they don't talk about the process stuff very much. They talk about who wins and who loses. 

00:31:10
DR. JAMES E. LOEHR The score card in society is pretty clear. It's winning. 

00:31:15
DR. DAMON BURTON The vast amount of money in sport creates a heightened sense of importance and, ah, with it comes pressure to perform. 

00:31:20
DR. DANIEL R. GOULD Because of all the media attention given to high-level sport and because of the pervasiveness in our society, you see it trickle down to the colleges and the high schools and then, then, you know, we have six and under golf championships all of a sudden. 

00:31:35
DR. DAMON BURTON Burnout for people who may have the talent, ah, really increases with their sport specialization. 

00:31:45
DR. DANIEL R. GOULD Specialization isn't bad by itself. It's specializing too early, prematurely before they get the benefits of other sport participation. 

00:31:55
DR. GLORIA BALAGUE A lot of people think that kids so specialized very early on on one sport or they don't have a chance to be successful. That means that these people are thinking the goal of the sport is to be very successful when you are young and I think that's the problem. The goal of the sport is to make sure that these young athletes have all of the tools to be successful later on. 

00:32:20
DR. DANIEL R. GOULD What you see at, at the professional level or the high college level is a different type of sport than we want for developing children where we're really trying to get physical, social, psychological benefits. 

00:32:35
DR. GLORIA BALAGUE It makes no sense to have a champion at age 12 but quits at age 13. 

00:32:40
DR. ARNOLD LEUNES A good deal of the problem, ah, with parents and new sport has to do with the fact that it's so institutionalized, so formalized. 

00:32:45
DR. KATE F. HAYS There are times when parents really end up so over engaged that they lose sight of the value of the sport for their child. 

00:33:00
DR. JUDY VAN RAALTE Most parents really do want what's best for their kids, it's that the way some parents attempt to deliver what they believe is what's best can actually lead their children to become burned out on the sport and drop out. 

00:33:10
It is estimated that less than 2 percent of high school athletes will receive an athletic scholarship 

00:33:10
DR. DAMON BURTON Part of it is driven by, ah, parents who really feel like their kids have to specialize in an early age if they wanna play at higher level, want a college scholarship. 

00:33:25
DR. DIANE L. GILL Most of the kids who are in new sports will not go on to professional careers. Most of them will not go on even to college, kinds of careers in sport. 

00:33:35
DR. DANIEL R. GOULD Most people say you want a broad base, give a lot of kids good sport training, fundamentals and then let them progress up when they're ready. 

00:33:40
The National Alliance for Youth Sports states that of the roughly 40 million children playing sports in America, approximately 75 percent will drop out by the age 13 

00:33:40
DR. GLORIA BALAGUE We lose a lot of, ah, kids because we put so much pressure on performance now on a-- on achieving things that they may not be ready to do yet. And, and we try to have them control things that they shouldn't, ah, although they can't. 

00:34:00
DR. JAMES E. LOEHR Society begins to put so much emphasis, our parent, our coaches, on winning at all cost and they don't have control over winning and that's the basis of this contingent(ph), very fragile self-esteem. That's a form of extrinsic motivation. 

00:34:15
DR. DAMON BURTON Too often goals get set on what it's gonna take to win, ah, versus what's, what's the standard that would really reflect to their level of performance for me today. 

00:34:25
DR. JACK J. LESYK If parents and coaches and teammates get on the same page and focus and focus on each athlete learning to perform as well as they can as many situations as possible winning is gonna take care of itself. 

00:34:40
DR. GLORIA BALAGUE For me sport psychology are just good for sport, those are good for life. 

00:34:45
DR. JUDY VAN RAALTE Some of the things that can transfer are willingness to work hard, ability to work with other people, ability to set goals, a passion for what you do. So all of those things can transfer from the sport world into school and jobs and relationships. 

00:35:00
DR. DANIEL R. GOULD Character or life skills in sport are not caught, for most people they're intentional taught. 

00:35:05
DR. KAY PORTER A number of athletic departments are now teaching life skills to athletes. 

00:35:10
DR. AMY ATHEY In our university we have, uhm, a program that needs one on one with every freshman and kinda goes through various aspects of, uhm, degree of development. 

00:35:20
DR. STEVE PORTENGA My primary focus at the collegiate level is to use sport as a hook to really focus on their personal development, kind of psychosocial development, really prepare them for life after college. 

00:35:35
DR. KEITH BELL One of the things I really like about sport is that the goal is extremely clear and everything gets measured so clearly. 

00:35:45
DR. GLORIA BALAGUE That is a terrific, ah, laboratory if you will, ah, to learn important life skills. 

00:35:50
DR. JAMES E. LOEHR The forces of sport can be extraordinary, forces for teaching people, how to prepare for things that will come inevitably their life. But if you have someone who doesn't understand that and they believe the only value is what's happening here and now and the consequences of this, ah, competitive event in the here and now, ah, as far as winning and losing, we're gonna create some real problems and it's a tragedy in many cases. 

00:36:15
DR. DANIEL R. GOULD Negative coaching and parents who get things out of, ah, a perspective can really have long term very negative effects on young people. 

00:36:25
DR. JACK J. LESYK The message that's learned is gonna have a great deal to do with the values of the adults who organize and supervise the sport. 

00:36:35
DR. MICHAEL L. SACHS And so given the right, ah, situation, the right coaches, the right parents, the right environment, ah, sport is an excellent means of building character but unfortunately it's not (inaudible ). 

00:36:45
DR. JACK J. LESYK The values need to modeled by the parents, coaches, everybody involved but they also need to spoken about, you know, even written guidelines and then we need to use rework for appropriate behavior and correction for inappropriate behavior. 

00:37:00
DR. DIANE L. GILL And then we wanna make sure as we're using extrinsic rewards that we're using them in a way that doesn't undermine intrinsic motivation but enhances it. 

00:37:10
DR. JAMES E. LOEHR When the motive is correct and it really is to develop this young boy or girl into a strong, more fully functioning person and to provide them with an opportunity whether they go 1 year, 10 years or they become number one in the world they look back on sport and see it as a gift. It was a gift no matter how long they participated because they became stronger, more, ah, resilient, more positive, more optimistic, a deeper, more stable sense of self-esteem and self-value. If that's the consequence, once we establish the purpose and that's the outcome, everybody wins. 

00:37:45
DR. JACK J. LESYK So it's very important to set that as a goal of this sport experience and to enumerate what we're trying to do and reinforce it as we go, not leave it to chance. 

00:37:55
DR. GLORIA BALAGUE If a coach defines success as improvement, then absolutely everybody in the team can have success. 

00:38:05
DR. JUDY VAN RAALTE Some people wonder what's the connection between sport and life skills and the coach can be one of the key links that connects that. The sport psychology consultant can make that connection as well. 

00:38:15
DR. ARNOLD LEUNES I think that scenario where sport psychologist can make a real contributions to creation of psychological packages to help coaches be better at what they do. 

00:38:25
DR. KEITH BELL A good coach is, ah, in the business of putting himself out of business and enabling the athlete to do without him. 

00:38:30
DR. GLORIA BALAGUE Most of the sport psychology, ah, learning and, and teaching is done by the coach. 

00:38:35
DR. DANIEL R. GOULD Every coach in America is a sport psychologist whether they wanna be or not. 

00:38:40
DR. KEITH BELL There are two things that are, are really important, uhm, in having coaching success. Uhm, one is to set really high standards and, and accept nothing less. And I think the other one is to clearly communicate to the athletes that the athletes can perform in a level much higher than the athletes simply can perform. 

00:39:05
DR. AMY ATHEY When we talk about life skills and what we can pull from sport, uhm, into character development, it starts with the way that they coaches. 

00:39:10
DR. ARNOLD LEUNES A big factor in new sports today is the disconnect between the goals or the parents and often the coaches and the kids. The kids are there to have fun, improve their skills, improve their fitness, the coaches very often put a high premium on winning. 

00:39:25
DR. JAMES E. LOEHR When we begin to realize that these external, ah, validators, these score cards of ex-- of extrinsic success become the prime markers for whether or not the sport experience is successful or not, the entire thing gets miscued(ph). 

00:39:40
DR. JUDY VAN RAALTE There's a widespread belief that sport builds characters and that if you participate in sport you'll turn out to be a better human being. But we all also know from reading the sports pages that sport can build characters and not-- and being great at sport can lead to actually some troubling outcomes for people. 

00:40:00
DR. STEVE PORTENGA There's an amazing athletes out there that if you wanna play basketball, this might be a particular person to emulate but if you wanna be a good person, you're probably not gonna use them as a role model. 

00:40:10
DR. JAMES E. LOEHR The longer people are involved in high-intensity sports athletics, the greater is the force on their character and in many cases, ah, the character is not enhance by that participation, it's undermined. 

00:40:25
DR. ARNOLD LEUNES The incentives to cheat in sport go up obviously as you go up the, ah, ladder, ah, in terms of beginning versus elite performance. 

00:40:35
DR. DANIEL R. GOULD It's easy to be moral when nothing counts. It's a lot harder to be moral when there's a lot on the line. 

00:40:40
DR. KAREN COGAN People want to win, that's where the money is, that's where the fame, glory are. 

00:40:45
DR. DANIEL R. GOULD The more you emphasize winning, the more you emphasize outcome in sport, the more likely people are gonna be tempted to bend the rules. 

00:40:55
DR. JAMES E. LOEHR If you don't really capture really what the ground rules are and what the personal ethics are, you find yourself reaching way beyond this ethical boundaries. You see people doing things that are highly unethical that they'll do anything to win. 

00:41:10
DR. KAREN COGAN We're hearing about the use of performance-enhancing drugs all the time in media. When you think what is-- what motivate somebody to use those kinds of things even at the risk of their own health. Uhm, you see how important that win is. 

00:41:25
DR. STEVE PORTENGA There's just a lot of different things that put an overemphasis on winning that try to connect who we are as people to winning, that athletes can learn growing up. And when we look at some of our issues in life today with respect to ethics, in business, in life in general, it's interesting that we can see that developing sport because of this focus on winning. 

00:41:45
DR. JAMES E. LOEHR For us, winning is character and coaching for character is the number one issue and being concern about an impact with the sport experience has on the developing person. There's no consideration more important than that. 

00:42:00
DR. DANIEL R. GOULD The more we can use sport to help build better people, to negotiate the ups and downs of life with good morals, good ethics, et cetera the better off we're gonna be.
