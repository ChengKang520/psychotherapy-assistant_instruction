MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development The 24th Annual Teachers College Winter Roundtable on Cultural Psychology and Education PRESENTS: Pedro Noguera, Ph.D. New York University, New York, NY Making Race Not Matter: Overcoming Racism and Racialization in American Society 

00:00:00
PEDRO NOGUERA  And so to speak of race when we make reference to Latinos or Asians for that matter is highly problematic because first of all, people in those categories don't think of themselves as being united. Right. Imagine the people from India and China seeing themselves as one is highly suspect, uhm, but when you look in Latin America and you recognize that the stratification in those societies bear much premise on color and differences related to ah, race and, and status and pigment, it becomes very clear that using race as a basis for organizing ourselves is totally a social invention, one that only makes sense within the context of the history of this country. It's not even, these categories are not even universal, and all we have to do is travel outside this country and we realize that people we thought were black, when they get to Africa they're not black at all. My brother who was very much a black nationalist in the 70s when he went to Tasadia(ph), he was being called Wasungu(ph). He didn't know why they'd call him a white man. He said, "I'm black like you." They said, "No, take a look. You're not like us at all. You're closer to them both in the way you look and in your customs and ways of seeing things." So, the idea that these racial categories have something to do with our biology, have something to do with some innate genetic sense of who we are is a total social fiction, and until we acknowledge that, we cannot escape from the many ways in which race continues to limit us. Race continues to ah, deny us our sense of humanity and race continues to serve as a basis for ongoing discrimination and oppression. 

00:02:00
PEDRO NOGUERA Now having said that, I also have to acknowledge that race has in fact served as a basis for solidarity, and that many of us cling to race and continue to because all of our associations with race are nonnegative. That is, when you belong to a group of black psychologists or Latino psychologists or Latino health professionals or Asian ah, American students, you can find in there a way to affirm your sense of who you are or find a way to assert your rights within a particular setting. You can find a way to ah, make sure that your culture or your sense of your culture, your sense of your rights are, are expressed and given meaning. And so, many of us cling to race and hold on to race because we know that if we lose that we lose ourselves. We lose ourselves because we then cease to be acknowledged, cease to be recognized, cease to have a basis for organizing ourselves against discrimination which continues to be operative in the society on the basis of this social invention, right? And so, we find ourselves in a situation where while we can acknowledge that race is, in fact, a social construct tied to a political project, that project being one of tied to oppression, colonization, imperialism, White supremacy, it is also a category that we cannot easily eliminate. We can't eliminate because we know that we continue to live in a country where race matters, where how you look matters, where phenotype matters, and so biology continues to be a factor. It's a factor because there are numerous studies which the most recent of which is a study showing that lighter-skinned immigrants get paid more on average than darker immigrants and those of us who say, "Duh!," because we know the reason why. For example, among African-Americans, there was currency in passing, right, that is, those who are light enough would choose to pass, right? It's because whiteness as Kim Crenshaw, law professor here at Columbia would like to say, is a form of property. That is, we can cash it in at the bank. If you can be seen as white, if you can pass for white, that means you have access to jobs, to rights and to privileges that are accorded to whites. And so, to ignore that reality, the fact that how we look matters, is I think at the, wa, a best, naive and at worst, a total denial of the fact that could color and phenotype and these social categories continue to play a major role in the way we organize our society. 

00:05:00
PEDRO NOGUERA It's also true that the counternarratives that developed from groups that had been raised historically, that have asserted their humanity on the basis of blackness, on the basis of indigenousness have played a major role in affirming our very rights to exist, our rights to expression. So, if you think about, for example the Pan-African Movement of Marcus Garvey and the powerful role played in affirming black identity at a time when blacks were being lynched throughout this country, when the Klan was marching through Washington, D.C. openly in their hoods, to assert black identity and a connection with Africa and to say, "I'm black and I'm proud" in the 1920s was a very bold and powerful statement. Bold and powerful because what it did was it normalized that which was seen in simply negative terms and began a long and arduous process of countering the historic hegemony that rendered blackness the ultimate negative category in the society. And one only has to look at societies where such movements have never occurred or had been suppressed to appreciate how important they are. I'll cite Cuba as an example. Cuban, in fact, did have a very strong pro-black, pro-African movement in the 1920s. It was suppressed brutally, right? And then interestingly after the revolution, Fidel Castro declares an end to racial discrimination but also an end to counting race. So, the irony is that in Cuba you cannot study race because there is no acknowledgement that racial categories exist. So, no one would like to believe that ra, Cuba's made great strides in overcoming racism, particularly those of us who think that Cuba's done some good things in advancing justice and equity at least. 

00:07:05
PEDRO NOGUERA  On the other hand, all one has to do is visit the country and recognize that a disproportionate number of those who are on the streets hustling tourists, those who are denied access to hotels, those who are disproportionally in the army but not present in the universities, particularly not the universities or even for that matter, in the Communist Party or black or at least dark and that power is disproportionate in the hands of those who are light and by most standards, white. And so, the idea that somehow you eliminate the visages of racism and of racial hierarchies simply by law and fiat is not borne out in the Cuban experience. The fact that there's no ongoing or at least there is, I would say, there many of people, writing now about efforts to assert black identity particularly throughout the Cuban religions and African-Cuban culture in the society, ah, ah, but the fact that there hasn't been a political movement equivalent to the Black Power Movement in the 1960s in Cuba, I think, speaks volumes to why it is that even in a society like Cuba, you'll find very little willingness to assert and to affirm blackness and very little willingness to confront the reality and the ways in which black people, people who are dark are still excluded from positions of privilege necessarily. 

00:08:35
PEDRO NOGUERA  And so the need to use race to counter white supremacy, I think, can't be understated and has to be acknowledged. The question though is what about here, in this country now, in post civil rights of what America. A time where race can, ceases to be the basis for denying access to universities, to jobs, to housing. That is, the law makes, has ended a power tide in America, and it's true. So that we can find examples of deliberate racial discrimination, all we have to do is contact our closest lawyer at the NYCP(ph) and we can challenge those because racism is outlawed in America, at least, racism of the legally sanctioned form, and that's a good thing. I appreciate the applause.(applause) 

00:09:30
PEDRO NOGUERA At the same time, we have lots of examples of individuals who clearly transcend racial categories. And the most recent example of this is the presidential candidate, Barack Obama. And what's interesting about Obama mania is the fact that people ah, claimed to identify with Obama not because he is a black candidate, but he is a candidate who happens to be black who speaks to a broad siemens(ph). We'll see how long this'll last, but ah, it's an interesting development. Ah, same could be said for the current governor of Massachusetts, Deval Patrick, who like Obama, comes from, with an Ivy League pedigree, who has, was won in a state that is overwhelmingly White, who was elected to the governorship, ah, does not deny his Blackness, does not pretend to be non-Black, but quite the opposite, ah, but at the same time was, has, has been able to appeal to a broad cross-section of the electorate, and like Obama, clearly seems to be a candidate who was elected not because he's Black but who happens to be Black. And we could go on because we have numerous other examples in entertainment, people like Oprah Winfrey and, I would say, Michael Jackson, but he is not so popular anymore. Uhm, it doesn't any do with race, especially since you can't tell what race he is anymore, but we have ah, ah, athletes, entertainers, politicians. People like Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell, all of whom seem to have escaped to some degree, though I would not say entirely, some of the trappings of race, some of the ways in which racism has historically has been used to limit the ascendancy of certain individuals. 

00:11:15
PEDRO NOGUERA And what I think that speaks to, and what, what I think it ah, suggests is that class matters. Right, that ah, the Brazilians like to say, "money whitens," right? And ah, 'coz interesting those that who are most able to transcend the barriers associated with race are people with lots of money or power or status or that combination. It's very rare to find someone who is poor and black or Latino who is suddenly universally loved and accepted because that somehow is not within even in the realm of possibility. Class matters and continues to matter in very profound ways because it is amongst the, those who are poor and raced, and by raced, placed in a category of the other, of the minority, of the non-white that we find the most clear examples and the most clear evidence that racism and discrimination is alive and well in America. If you want an example, it's interesting to note the Latinos in this country were not, until 1980, there was no such things as Latinos, ah, at least according to US Census. Latinos were not identified. You cannot check a box that said I'm a Hispanic or I'm a Latino. There was none. Latinos were considered white. So, if ever there were ah, ah, historic arguments that being considered white did not give you white privileges, was the case of Latinos. Because despite the fact that Lat, Latinos were considered white, we had ma, a long history of segregating children of Mexican descent in schools in Texas to California, of denying Puerto Ricans access to jobs and housing in, in the Northeast, and so merely because you call a group white does not mean that they get the treatment of whites. Unless again of course, you actually look white and can assimilate. 

00:13:10
PEDRO NOGUERA And I'd refer you here to a book by Patricia Gandara. Patricia is a professor of Education in UCLA, now where, the book called "Beyond the Ivory Tower." One thing she does in the book is she profiles several successful Latino professionals. And one of the recurring themes amongst these professionals that they speak to you about this success is how they learned to have to pass. That is, to deny their Latinoness, to blend in order to fit into certain settings. It was key to their own mobility, and that's not an unfamiliar story. Many white ethnics know that the price for mobility in America has always been assimilation, what we call Anglicization and what we called before ah, the melting pot. You have to melt, but you're not simply melting, you are assimilating to the dominant culture and in the process giving up your Italian, your Irish, your Slavic heritage, where Latinos who are upper class, have done the same kinds of thing in large numbers. So, one of the reasons why we're surprised sometimes to find that some of the people we think are white were actually Latino, like Rita Hayward, Wonder Woman; because Linda Carter wasn't always Linda Carter and Rita Hayward wasn't always Rita Hayward. You can change your name and it works particularly if you look white. But for those who do not look white, the ability to simply assimilate has always been more difficult. And so, phenotype continues to play an important role in determining patterns of mobility as does class and education, and so, when we start to think about how to understand that ongoing legacy of race in America, we cannot ignore the role that class plays, the role that phenotype plays, the role that group context plays. That is, it means something to be different in black if you live in Iowa in the middle of rural areas run by white people than it does if you live in Harlem because context profoundly shapes your sense of who you are and shapes what it means to be a member of a group and also in turn influences how you'll be treated. Race still matters in this country because of history. A history that we cannot escape. A history that we cannot write off. It's a history that continues to show up in lots and lots of significant ways. 

00:15:35
PEDRO NOGUERA  Ah, just recently, when they were doing excavations in Wall Street, they lo and behold, discovered a black cemetery, a cemetery next to Wall Street which was once a place where Africans were sold, all right? And a ce, cemetery that was never acknowledged because it was blacks who were kept there. And then the question becomes, well, should we, at this time, then acknowledge the people who built, helped to build this city. Race continues to come up because we have this unsettled history, an unwillingness to acknowledge past wrongs. And because of that unwillingness to acknowledge past wrongs, we have a legacy of resentment and bitterness. There are and continue to be major institutions that profited from their participation in slavery. Brown University has recently done a remarkable thing of creating a commission to study the history of Brown and the slave trade. I'm, actually if a Brown graduate know a little bit about that history and two of those Brown brothers were slave traders. What happens when you go to a university or attend a university that derived at least some of its origins from the profits of the slave trade? What, if any, responsibility does that institution have to the descendants of slaves, descendants who made ah, whose, whose descendants made the birth of that university pop(ph), possible? And it's not just universities, it's insurance companies, it's banks, it's large corporations, hard to trace sometimes, but the fact is that significant portion of the wealth of this country was made possible by the slave trade, by the fact that we could use black labor to make this country a wealthy nation. And the fact that we are not willing to acknowledge that history, the fact that we are not willing to acknowledge that many of those now crossing the border and coming to states like California, Arizona, Texas, they didn't have those names not simply because they sound cute, but because they were once part of Mexico, and now what we're seeing is the re-Mexicanization of United States brought on largely because of the vast inequity in wealth between the North and the South and that these trends will not cease simply because we put up walls and fences and hire mercenaries to patrol the border because economy, the global economy will drive it both in drawing that labor here and in pushing them from the countries where they reside now. 

00:18:35
PEDRO NOGUERA And race is very much central to that ongoing debate about immigrants in America because there is no great outcry about Canadian or Irish immigrants who happened to be in this country illegally. The source of all the unease is the growing presence of Latinos, in particular Mexicans and Central Americans who are showing up in places where Latinos were never seen before, (laughs) Oklahoma and North Carolina, and the fact that America is destined to become a non-White nation. This is our future and a future that many Americans are still not ready to accept. We know that in the present race continues to matter in profound ways. Those of us who live in New York City know of the recent killing of Sean Bell, an African-American who was shot 50 times unarmed by five police officers, one of whom reloaded it. The fact that one of those officers was African-American and two others were Latinos does not mean that race was not a factor in the killing because many of us know that the way in which race and racism operates, it does not free those who were raised from racist views or from the stereotypes which render certain individuals criminals by just by virtue of how they look and where they are at a particular time. And we have numerous other examples. 

00:20:10
PEDRO NOGUERA Increasingly, I'd like to focus in my work less on racism than on racial inequality. And I do that not because I don't think racism is still a factor in American society, I think there's lots of evidence that said that it is, and if you think recently there was a study, a few years ago in the University of Chicago on employers and how the names of candidates, job candidates corresponded with whether or not you got an interview. And they took candidates, only for the sake of, of ah, discussion here, Keisha(ph) and Kevi(ph), Keisha(ph) and Quame(ph), with the same criteria as Kevin and Kelly. Right, and guess who got the interviews, and guess who got called back even when they had the same credentials. Keisha(ph) and Quame(ph) were not that attractive as candidates. So racism is still operative and at the same time we live in a society where even the most racist individuals aren't willing to admit their racism. One of the things that made the Trent Lott incident so interesting and noteworthy is that Trent Lott was caught saying what typically is only said in private settings, that he thought Strom Thurmond would have been a good president. A man who ran for president as a white, ah, you know, apologetic white supremacist and Trent Lott, speaker of the majority of the Senate said, "This would have been a great president. We wouldn't have a lot of the problems that we have now had Strom Thurman been elected." Only to find then that he's no longer acceptable as a, in that leadership role. He continues to be in the Senate, and actually now back into a leadership role in the Senate. So, maybe he went to rehab. That's the kind of craze when you say something bad in public, you go to rehab and absolve yourself of your public sins. 

00:22:00
PEDRO NOGUERA I decided in my own work to try to focus on racial inequality because unlike racism which is hard to pin down, racial inequality is empirical. You can measure it. You can study it. You can see it up close. You can look at the ways, for example, in which blacks are treated differently in the criminal justice system for the same crimes and study that we continue to treat black offenders very differently, longer sentences for the same offenses as the white offenders. You can look for example at the persistence of school segregation over 50 years after the Brown decision, and ask how it's possible that Latinos today constitute the group most likely to be segregated in American education not by law but by fact. And not only that Latinos are more likely to be segregated even more so than African-Americans, but also more likely to be concentrated in the poorest of these well-funded schools. And today, unlike 20 years ago, it's not even an issue, not even a source of controversy. Participated quite a bit in policy discussions in New York City about the reform of the schools, I keep pointing out that there's nothing being done in the city about the fact that they concentrate the poorest, neediest kids who are disproportionally black and Latino in the worst schools with the least experienced principals, the least experienced teachers. But that's an issue despite Jonathan Kozol's book, 'Shame of the Nation', which he devotes several chapters from New York City, is not even a subject for a debate in New York City. We have Plessy versus Ferguson, but in effect, without even acclaimed commitment to equality, right? As Plessy said, "Separate but equal. Now, they never gave us equal." 

00:24:00
PEDRO NOGUERA Today, we have separate and profoundly unequal, and that's largely accepted as the state of things in America. We have a law, No Child Left Behind and it says we are in a whole case and the same standards. So, we give the kids in Scarsdale the same test as the kids in the South Bronx. We feel that's equitable and fair even though we know the children in South Bronx are educated under very different conditions. The fact that there is so little attention to the brutal inequities in education today speaks volumes to how far backward we've come and how this current attempt to deny race leaves us less able to confront the reality of racial inequity. I was in a debate a few years ago, with Ward Connerly. Ward Connerly, as you know, is the leading champion of dismantling affirmative action started in California and now working his way across the country. And Ward has been arguing and getting voters, even in places like Michigan, to agree that race should not be used as the basis for making decisions in admissions. I pointed it out to Ward and said, "If that's really what you want, why don't you make race not a basis for funding decisions in schools. And why don't you ensure that kids of all races, regardless of where they live, have access to quality education from preschool through high school? That is, if we're really serious about making race not matter in hiring(ph), why don't we start by making it not matter in K-12?" And Ward responded by saying, "Well, that's a good point, but that is not my issue. It's someone else's issue." 

00:25:50
PEDRO NOGUERA So, we end up with this irony of the Bush Administration on the one hand, when it comes to affirmative action, saying "race should not be used," but when it comes to No Child Left Behind, "race should be used" as a basis for judging schools and a basis for holding schools accountable is the irony that few policy makers even acknowledge because No Child Left Behind has in fact, made these categories even much more important than they've ever been with respect to federal policies towards education. (clears throat) 

00:26:25
PEDRO NOGUERA So, I would argue that it's by focusing on racial inequality, by focusing on disparities in healthcare, by focusing on disparities in criminal justice, in employment and in incarcerations and education that we begin to make progress because when we eliminate or when we counter the effects of racial inequality, we begin to create a society that is more equitable. And while that is not the same as addressing attitudes and beliefs, I believe that if you can change actual circumstances, that over time, attitudes and beliefs will change as well. Ah, and I would also argue that to the degree that we can focus concretely on issues like health and education and criminal justice that we can also ease and improve race relations considerably. So, let me take that a step further and talk about what it would take to make race matter less because while making race not matter may not be attainable, it should be possible to do things that would make race matter less. 

00:27:30
PEDRO NOGUERA And I want to say, first of all, that we've got to, in the field of education, focus much more directly on the questions related to equity. And equity, though it is a term that's frequently used today, I would argue that the term is not well understood by many because equity is not treating everyone the same. If you read a book that Christopher Jencks' wrote in the early 70's, 'Inequality'. One of Jencks' points is that American society is a society that feels comfortable with equality of opportunity, but not so comfortable with equality and results. Equity, is a as an operating principle, focuses both on opportunity and results. Because we have to be oh, and attentive not only to whether or not we provide student/children with adequate educational opportunities, we also have to be mindful of whether or not those opportunities influence outcomes and how they influence outcomes such as graduation rates, access to college, access to graduate schools and choose the professions. Because it is, it is only by being attentive to questions with access and attainment that we begin to change the racial landscape within education. It is an ongoing practice in many schools to assign the best teachers or the most experienced teachers to the highest achieving kids and to assign the least experienced, least effective teachers to the neediest students. And we do this in most school districts not because there's any research supporting it. We do it for two reasons. We do it because teacher unions push for it. Push for seniority to give them the ability to choose which children they'll teach. And we do it because the parents of high achievers will not allow their children to be subjected to teachers who are less than competent. The parents of the other children, particularly those who are poor and African-American or Latino make a crucial mistake particularly when it comes to education and that is they trust the schools. And they assume that when they send their kids to school that no one will deliberately assign incompetent teachers to their children, particularly immigrants were they come from, it doesn't matter what country they come from. In most countries, immigrants tend to be better deferential to teachers and deferential to educators and not as likely to question, to challenge assignments, and often don't realize that if they don't engage schools as critical consumers, their children are likely to be shortchanged and denied opportunities. 

00:30:10
PEDRO NOGUERA And so part of what we've got to do, when we look at schools, is also expose the numerous ways in which inequity is conditioned into practice. It manifests itself in discipline practices because in most schools we disproportionately punish the neediest children who end up in many districts being disproportionately Black or Latino and male. We punish them through two means. Typically, through humiliation initially and if that does not work, through exclusion. And so we deliberately deny children access to education as a form of punishment and can further the drop out rates. And some would argue well, some kids that act out so much they need to be put out, and my question always is, "Does putting them out ever change their behavior?" And the fact that in most schools we continue to suspend the same kids over and over again is the clearest evidence that most of the approaches to discipline are totally ineffective. Unless the goal is really to simply get rid of those kids, then in that case, they may actually have been producing that result. 

00:31:20
PEDRO NOGUERA  Inequity shows up very clearly in special education practices because although we spend more money typically on children who we've identified as learning disabled, in most districts, the longer they've been categorized in that way, the further behind they fall. If you think about it, these are students for whom there is a legally required IEP, right? Individualized Educational Plan, that is theoretically, someone knows exactly what these students need. So, how could it be that in so many cases, these kids go fall further and further behind. Well, anyone who works, and who knows that typically there is no quality control in these provision of services to these children. There are very often those who are assigned to teach these children are not trained or qualified. That often those kids are put in basements, put in bungalows, put in the backroom somewhere. So, they are denied learning opportunities. So Special Education in many of our school systems becomes a way again to get rid of kids that we don't want to serve. Not always, not if you got a lawyer, not if you know what your rights are because I know lots of parents, particularly well educated parents who are able to milk Special Education for lots of resources when they're able to understand what their rights are and how to navigate the system. That tends not to be the case for most poor parents of any race. 

00:32:50
PEDRO NOGUERA  So we need to focus on equity in schools. And there are lots and lots of ways in which schools promote inequity and I would say one of the ways is by being inatttentive to the ways in which the backgrounds of children plays them at disadvantage or advantage within schools. I often say that many of the kids that we now call gifted in American education, are not gifted at all. They're simply privileged. And we tend to confuse being privileged with being gifted. If you come from a family where your parents are highly educated, where you have a parent that doesn't have to work and therefore, can spend lots of time reading to you, preparing you for school and coaching you through the process, chances are, you're going to come to school very well prepared, far more advanced than many of the other children not because you are any more talented, but simply because you get so much more at home. And while we cannot or there's very little we can do to level the playing field in peoples' homes, we can do more to ensure that when they get to school that we don't exacerbate the inequities. 

00:34:00
PEDRO NOGUERA Homework is an equity issue. If you don't have access to a parent who's college-educated and a computer at home, then you typically cannot get the same degree of support at home with homework. And I could go on and on with the examples, but I think, for particularly those of you in the field of education, need to be mindful of the ways in which treating kids the same often results in reproducing patterns of inequity within school. And that actually equity means being much attentive to differences and attentive to the ways in which particularly differences in resources related to class result in children experiencing very different treatment within school. 

00:34:40
PEDRO NOGUERA  In addition to focusing on equity, we need to focus on deliberate inclusion. One of the most equitable societies I had been to, from the standpoint of race, is Belize, a small country in Central America. Belize ensures because they are a multilingual, multicultural society that all groups are represented in media, in education, in government. That is, they have quotas. They say, "We want to make sure that Spanish speakers are included, that English speakers are included, that Garifona speakers are included, that various indigenous language are included because if we don't deliberately do that, then rules will be left out." Majority rule can be the most exclusive system of all. If we are serious about making diversity a source of strength, then we have to ensure that all are represented in our institutions and have access to opportunities within society and a little country like Belize, I think, sets a good example in many ways on how this can be done. I was visiting this small private school in New York last week, Manhattan Day School which has a deliberate policy of being inclusive both on the base of race and class, and because, and again they set categories and targets to make sure that at each grade level, children from different backgrounds are represented within the school. And lo and behold, they end up with a school that is far more diverse than most public schools in New York City. 

00:36:15
PEDRO NOGUERA It is, rather than ignoring race, it is when we deliberately focus on race and inclusion that we end up with institutions that are more representative and more able, better able to reflect the populations that we are attempting to serve. Finally, if we are interested in making race matter less, we've got to focus on fighting injustice. And I have to say here that it is when groups who are not targeted come to the aid and rise to the challenges that beset other groups, that is groups other than their own, that we begin to create a climate of genuine solidarity where we no longer think it's each group for themselves. Think, for example, about the Seven Party Wall Center(ph), which is largely staffed by white attorneys in Alabama that has been leading the ongoing fight against racism and discrimination not only against blacks, but also now against Latino immigrants and doing it in some of the roughest, most bitterly racist communities in this country. And they've been fire bombed over and over again. They've been attacked. And these same white attorneys continue to courageously fight racism. It is knowing when we have allies that are not like ourselves that we appreciate and begin to see that perhaps really this struggle against racism is really about a struggle for human dignity that can, in fact, transcend our differences. 

00:37:50
PEDRO NOGUERA  And I would add here that although this conference is not focused on sexual orientation, I would say the same is true for people who are gay or lesbian and transgendered because it is when those who are not in those categories speak up for their rights and assert their rights that we create and help to create a society and, and a climate that is more tolerant, more respectful because if it's only those who are targeted who stand up, then you reinforce the sense that something is wrong with those who have been targeted. I was speaking to the president of Philadelphia University. He is a white man who happened to have adopted two Korean children. Prior to his adopting these children, he thought he lived in a very tolerant community until he got to the basketball games. As he watched his adopted daughter play and he'd hear the racists' comments coming out of the stands directed at his daughter, and he said that he had to stop going to the games or he'll get into fights regularly. But what he did with his anger about the treatment of his children was work to consciously create a diverse university, the highly diverse faculty to ensure that students from a variety of backgrounds are being admitted to university. That is Robin, and Jess trying to protect and shelter his children. He decided he had to do more to ensure that he was working actively to create a climate that was more inclusive, more tolerant, more respectful of those who were historically denied access to universities. 

00:39:20
PEDRO NOGUERA  Let me close by saying this. At moments of crisis in this country's history, we often realize that race doesn't matter. I was in the Bay Area in 1989 during the Loma Prieta earthquake. And to those of you who remember that, that was, the A's were playing the ah, ah, the ah, Giants in the World Series and the earthquake struck and a large freeway in West Oakland. The upper, upper level collapsed on the lower level. A couple hundred people were trapped in their cars. The people closest on hand were largely African-Americans within housing projects right below the freeway who scaled the freeway and began to free people from their cars, risking their lives to do so. As they pulled people from their cars, they did not stop to ask what color they are, what religion, what sexual orientation; they freed those who were trapped. Those of us who were here in New York in 9/11 we remember the same kinds of expressions of solidarity, of support during that moment of crisis. Sad in some ways that it takes a moment of crisis, an earthquake or a terrorist's attack, to get people to see that at our base level, we are all human who have the same needs, same desires, same wants. Question is what we do to make that possible beyond crises. What do we do to make it (phone ringing) an operative principle, a way of doing our work, a way of engaging each other because I would argue that until we can do that, race will still matter, not just in this country, but throughout the world. Thank you.
