ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive foundation to help you in trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is, remember feeling completely engaged? We all have moments in life where we're busy with something and immersed in activity and before we know it, hours have passed by. This feeling of being in the flow of the activity is associated with being at one with our lives, feeling right. Let's practice together. Just think of the one moment in time. Maybe when you are 12-years-old and riding a bicycle or 27 and starting a job you loved. Two, the idea of this exercise is to just choose any moment in your lifetime. It can be a small moment like maybe visiting a favorite aunt or a pivotal life changing moment where you were simply deeply engaged and enjoying every moment of the experience. Three, find that moment and then imagine yourself back in the moment. Close your eyes so that you can get the full affect. Imagine that you can see what you saw in that moment. Imagine you can hear what you heard. Feel what you felt. Sense what you sensed in that moment. Be there and recapture again that full-body experience.
