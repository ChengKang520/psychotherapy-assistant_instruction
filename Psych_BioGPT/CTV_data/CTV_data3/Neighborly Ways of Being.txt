Neighborly Ways of Being with Peggy Sax Ph.D. Sheila McNamee Ph.D. 

00:00:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE So Peggy, this is a good time to transition. I- I'm really curious, you've written about, um, what you call Neighborly Ways of Being... 

00:00:15
PEGGY SAX Mmhm. 

00:00:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE ...and, you know, I think this whole conversation that we're having here today is sparked by the, um, the ah- this neighborly ways of being as kind of being one illustration of a relational ethic. 

00:00:35
PEGGY SAX Mmhmm. 

00:00:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE And, so I'm wondering if you could sp-, speak a little bit to that, you know, explain what you mean by neighborly ways of being, perhaps how you came to that term. 

00:00:45
PEGGY SAX Mmhm. 

00:00:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE And also, um, how you see that in your practice, fitting with this sense of a relational ethic. 

00:00:55
PEGGY SAX Great, yeah. Well first I want to say, um, I, I was remembering, ah, a conversation I had with a colleague, oh, many years ago, who's also a family therapist. And, um, we were, uh, these more collaborative, relational ways of working, we were talking about that, and she said, "You know, I th-" - it was so exciting to read, um, because she said, "Truthfully, this is the way I've been working behind closed doors all these years." And I think it was when feminists, um, uh, um, sort of the whole idea of, of living in connection, and of feminist family therapy was coming out... 

00:01:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mm-hmm. 

00:01:40
PEGGY SAX She said, "I just don't tell my supervisor." And that was back in the eighties. 

00:01:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah, no, right. 

00:01:45
PEGGY SAX So, um, I want to preface what I want to say here by saying I do speak from a privileged place in that I, uh, while I did work for a number of years in agencies in a parent-child center, in a community mental health center, and I've done consulting with organizations, and state agencies, that I'm an independent practitioner now, so I- there's not a layer there, that might be there for others. 

00:02:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE Right. 

00:02:15
PEGGY SAX I don't need to answer to my boss, um and to also the regulations of a given agency. 

00:02:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mmhm. 

00:02:20
Thoughtfully Consider Compatability with Professional Code of Ethics" 

00:02:20
PEGGY SAX As a practicing therapist-psychologist, where I have to be always conscious of the professional regulations that I live under, and with, um, that um, it's very important, uh, to at the same time be in touch with my gut. 

00:02:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mmhm. 

00:02:40
PEGGY SAX And, um, and sometimes those two, uh, are- there's a dissonance between them, um.... 

00:02:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. 

00:02:45
PEGGY SAX ...and, and, and how to- how to listen to both at the same time. 

00:02:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. 

00:02:50
PEGGY SAX And I want to preface it by that... 

00:02:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. 

00:02:50
Honoring Local Culture and Context 

00:02:50
PEGGY SAX Um, and, um, I'd love to tell you about neighborly ways of being, I want to situate that in, um, my own location, which is Vermont, and I think about what you've written about how, um, how local means a lot, you know? That there's- this isn't about creating kind of global, um, understandings. That- that everything's contextualized. And um, and that hopefully our work builds on the positive- what the strengths are of a given location. While knowing, that, uh, no place is idealized, or, you know, it- there's everything that's there, and I live in Vermont. It's a small state. Um, I think there's something like 600,000 people in the entire state. I can't tell anymore whether we're growing or shrinking, but I- but I know we're far from 700,000, you know?And I live in a town that's a college town... 

00:03:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE Uh-huh. 

00:03:50
PEGGY SAX ...um, but I think we have, I don't know, maybe it's 10,000 people, or maybe it's 20 if you count the county. It's a small... 

00:04:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. 

00:04:00
PEGGY SAX ...small place I live. 

00:04:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE Been there, I know. 

00:04:05
PEGGY SAX Yes. Yeah! And I also live in a state where there's a tremendous pride and history of community-mindedness, and um, and resourcefulness. Because people don't necessarily have a lot of money, um, in fact, one of the things that when people do idealize Vermont as this idyllic place, there's a, um, it's really important to remind people- there's a lot of poverty in Vermont, um, and um, and there's, uh- while not diversity in other ways, there's a lot of- or not as much diversity in other places, there's tremendous economic diversity in Vermont, um. 

00:04:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mmhm. 

00:04:50
Reclaiming Community out of Catastrophe 

00:04:50
PEGGY SAX We were just hit by, um, a tropical storm Irene. By the time it got to Vermont it was a tropical storm. Nobody thought that it was going to have the devastating effects that it did. It did not have devastating effects on the entire state, but in almost like random pockets, um, the effects were really devastating. 

00:05:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mmhm. 

00:05:15
PEGGY SAX And, um, I, uh- there was sort of a convergence of events for me, just to tell a little bit of the background for, um, the neighborly ways of being... 

00:05:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mmhm. 

00:05:25
PEGGY SAX ...where I was invited to give a workshop, in, um, Bordeaux, France, and I decided to boldly do some recording, of some of my own sessions, and conversations, with permission of people. And when I made that decision, it was the week before, uh, Tropical Storm Irene came through. And so suddenly, people were coming into my office, uh, some of whom were profoundly impacted by that storm. And, I, um, I started to really pay attention to what then became, uh, thinking about how people, um, engage in ways of being with each other, that are based on this idea within my culture, or the U.S. culture, of being neighborly. Um, and I thought back to Fred Rogers, and Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, and um, these images that were assumptions for me, until I went to France, with my, um, uh, videotapes and audiotapes, because three women gave me, graciously gave me permission to tell their stories and to show video clips, and at the break in the first day of the workshop, someone came to me and said, "I just want to make sure that when you say neighborly way of being, you mean neighborly as a good thing, right?" And- and I realized, that it did not have the same connotation, so that makes me think very much of your article here... 

00:07:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE Uh-huh. 

00:07:10
PEGGY SAX ...that we can't, um, make those assumptions. But once we worked through the language, and that maybe translated in a different way, that these ideas of linking lives with others, of stepping back, being of service, um, of taking turns in a sense, being there for each other, um, of building these kinds of alliances in times of crisis. 

00:07:35
PEGGY SAX Mmhm. 

00:07:35
A Paradise Built in Hell: The Extraordinary Communities That Arise in Disaster 

00:07:35
by Rebecca Solnit 

00:07:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE Um, that these are all things that people could relate to. And then, also there was conversation that it's not only in crisis. We learn a lot, um, from, uh, disasters, and how we, um, uh, uh, respond to those, and that could be anything from an environmental, um, disaster, or like Tropical Storm Irene, um, and, or the kinds of disasters that this lovely book, A Paradise Built in Hell, um, the Extraordinary Communities that Arise in Disasters, by, uh, Rebecca Solnit, um, wrote about. Um, but as she says, these situations often bring out the best in us. Not the way the media portrays the, um, havoc that can be created. And that we can learn from that. So I then brought those understandings of relational ways of being and neighborly ways of being, and kinda started thinking about how neighborly ways of being could be an illustration of, of relational practice. And one other, uh, concept there I'm bringing in, um, we've both been very impacted by the work of Lynn Hoffman, and in conversation with her, she spoke about what she calls communal practices... 

00:09:10
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mmhm. 

00:09:10
PEGGY SAX And she says that, um, communal practices, she prefers that term to clinical practices. 

00:09:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah, that's nice. 

00:09:20
PEGGY SAX Yeah. 

00:09:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE That's very nice. 

00:09:20
PEGGY SAX Yeah. 

00:09:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE So I'm curious, um, you know, because we are talking about relational ethics for professionals, how your, eh- when you talk about neighborly ways of being, it seems to me you're really talking about these, um, extraordinary women . . . I have the advantage of knowing a little bit more than we've had time to talk about here... 

00:09:45
PEGGY SAX Yeah. 

00:09:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE ....but these extraordinary women, who have in, in the face of- of a life crisis for themselves, recognized the support of their community. And also given back support. 

00:09:55
PEGGY SAX Mmhm. 

00:09:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE And I'm wondering as a pro- you, the professional, where- where you are in that, um, are you just telling us that they, these women, in acting in neighborly ways, have enacted a relational ethic? Yes, is the idea. 

00:10:20
PEGGY SAX Mmhm. 

00:10:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE But is there another story about yourself as a professional, enacting a relational ethic, and if so ho-, what does that look like? 

00:10:30
PEGGY SAX Yes. 

00:10:30
SHEILA MCNAMEE Allows these stories to unfold, or something like that. 

00:10:30
PEGGY SAX Yes. Um, thank you for that question, because I realized I ofen become so awed by what I see, and the unfolding of people's stories, that um, uh, my colleagues, my friends, would- would say, Yes, Peggy, but what are you doing in order to bring that forth? 

00:10:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mmhm. 

00:10:50
Building on Naturally Sustaining Webs of Connection 

00:10:50
PEGGY SAX And I, um, I forget to pay attention to what I might contribute there. Um, and I also just want to make sure to go back to what you said about gender, and about women, as we, if we can both remember that? 

00:11:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE Sure, I'll try. 

00:11:05
PEGGY SAX Yeah. So for me and my work, um, I think that, um, these, uh, uh, that I think about people living lives that I only see a small sliver of. And that, um, that I will be, hopefully we, we- the connection that we have will be life-affirming, to both of us. Um, but I am stepping in in a very small, um, segment of someone's life. They may come back, um, but they, their life exists outside of the consultation room. 

00:11:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mmhm. 

00:11:40
PEGGY SAX And, um, so the kind of healing that they're looking for, the kinds of dilemmas that they're facing, and I can give a couple of examples, um are the way that they will go about working that through, are in a way that they will feel more, um, more in touch with their own wisdom, let's say, more, um, more grounded in an identity that is celebrating life, um. That, that will not only be through our conversation, that will be in what happens outside our conversation. However, through our conversation, through the kinds of things that we explore together as possibilities, sometimes that really does impact what someone will do when they'll go back out into the world. I never know what really came from me, or from some other source... 

00:12:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE Mmhm. 

00:12:40
Relationally Engaged Practices 

00:12:40
PEGGY SAX But what's most important to me is that someone goes out and can live a richer, um, life, and where their-where their identity feels more a celebration of life, and more attune with who they want to be in the world. Yeah. Yeah. So... 

00:12:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE So it sounds to me like, uh, some of the things we were talking about earlier are sort of the, the practices or the resources that you use as you, um, work with, with people, with these women that you're talking about. So things like, uh, curiosity, you know, generous curiosity, not just about them and their problem, about the other slices of their life that aren't there in the room, perhaps. 

00:13:25
PEGGY SAX Yes. 

00:13:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE I mean, to use the language you were using earlier. And, um, and also kind of the basic premise of privileging first relationships, out of which a sense of self emerges... 

00:13:40
PEGGY SAX Yes. 

00:13:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE So maybe- you know, I'm that imagining you invite them to tell stories about relationships where they have different identities they might prefer more than the one that they're struggling with at the moment, or something. I, I . . . 

00:13:55
PEGGY SAX Yeah. Uh- I first want to say that while I brought to you, um, several, uh, stories or accounts by women, that um, and why- I, I, I think it really, certainly in my practice, more women are engaging in these communal practices. It seems to be more part of the, um, encouraged culture of women, um. But I, I've never done a- you, know, really looked statistically at my practice, but I would say probably at least 40% of my practice is men. 

00:14:30
SHEILA MCNAMEE Uh-huh. 

00:14:30
>Available to Women AND Men 

00:14:30
PEGGY SAX Um, and, um, and there are men that- these practices also feel very important for men, while they may not be . . . Some men may not be as practiced.... 

00:14:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yes. 

00:14:40
PEGGY SAX ...um, uh, because it hasn't been culturally encouraged. But I just want to emphasize that... 

00:14:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE Sure. 

00:14:50
PEGGY SAX That these are available to us all. 

00:14:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. Right. 

00:14:50
PEGGY SAX When thinking about some practices and beliefs, and then maybe I could say a couple, and then give a, a couple of illustrations. 

00:15:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE Sure. 

00:15:00
Influential Narrative Ideas and Practices 

00:15:00
PEGGY SAX Um, because my practice has been very informed by, um, uh, by narrative therapy, and by, um, the, um- One of the concepts, for example, that, um of an ethic of circulation, and the idea that you can have an ethic of confidentiality, but at the same time believe that with options given, always- this is not ever prescribed, that to offer possibilities for someone, to experience their story, as, um, being useful to someone else, um, to experience themselves as having their life linked with someone else. Whether that be in person, whether that be through letter-writing, whether that be through something that we co-create and home-make, um. Many many different options. So, uh, for example, um, one of the women whose story I presented, and her name- we'll call her Joan, she had experienced a, she came to me within a month of the time when her husband had died, and he had died of- of suicide, his own hand. And she was devastated by this, um, uh, by this. They were, uh, very close, um, they'd had a very difficult few years, or couple of years, before, um, before he had died. And, um, one of the first things I thought to myself was, I have worked with several other people whose husbands, or whose partners, have died, um, who have taken their life, um, who have abandoned their lives, so I was very conscious of paying attention to when, in my own judgment, might be a good time to make an offer to her. For her it came sooner than I think it might have for someone else, um, and maybe by the second session, I asked her if she would ever, um, let, just to let me know, if she would ever like to, um, meet someone else, who, um, who- whose situation was different in many ways, but also who had um, a partner, life's partner, who had, um, who had abandoned his life. And, um, and she, uh, was at that point uh, very emotional, and she said yes, she would. So I had not set this up, and I went and then I asked someone who I had worked with during that time when she, uh, four years before had been devastated by her husband's death. And she said she would be very happy to come. So I think by the fourth session I brought the two of them together, and it's interesting to me to reflect back, because since then, Joan has also shared some, now a few months later, looking back what that was like. 

00:18:15
Offering Options and Exploring Possibilities 

00:18:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE Uh-huh. 

00:18:20
PEGGY SAX At the time, I couldn't really tell ho, whether, or to what extent, it was helpful to Joan. Because she was, uh, really tearful, and um, and asked some questions, but was mostly very quiet and absorbing. And the other woman, um, told her story, and also told it from the place of where she is now, where she has really, um- in a new chapter of her life. Later Joan looked back and said that was a very powerful moment for her, that connecting with someone else and seeing that other possibilities exist, um, meant, opened up something for her, and she even said something like, I would do anything for this woman. 

00:19:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE So, what strikes me about that story is that, um, it seems to me that you're suggesting that if we were to step back and think about ethical practice, those- making those kind of connections might temper on crossing an ethical line, you know, due to confidentiality. One person's story is their story and their experience and now- but you're, you're proposing, you know, boldly, to cross that line. But the difference is, is that you don't cross the line. You say, what about.... 

00:19:50
PEGGY SAX Yeah. 

00:19:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE ...and it becomes- Everyone, the two women... 

00:19:55
PEGGY SAX Yes. 

00:19:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE Either one could say no, I'm not interested and there's no- so- but, and then the by-product of that, of everyone saying yes, let's give it a try is that it becomes more, um, it's less the professional-client relationship but here are these two women sharing, as it they were friends or neighbors... 

00:20:15
PEGGY SAX Yes. 

00:20:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE ...sharing a common tragedy. 

00:20:20
PEGGY SAX Yes. 

00:20:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE Which really is so human. 

00:20:25
PEGGY SAX And they- Yes. And they are very, um, clear about their differences, um, and at the same time, come together here, um. They can, they can judge that for themselves, is what my sense has been. And, um, Joan also, uh, um, we talked about the possibility of just going online and looking to see, because there are online, um, support groups for survivors of suicide. And she did that exploration, and she found a group that she really connected with, and, um, that, she said there was a time where she would spend, I don't know whether it was hours of very intense time engaging with people in that group. Um, and then, uh, she doesn't now, in the same way. We also spoke about a, um, a group that's um, in, um, in our community, that's run by the local hospice that's for survivors of suicide. She wasn't sure she wanted to do that, and then one day on her own, she went, and she said that it was, uh, really really helpful to her. She didn't go back yet, partly because, uh, Tropical Storm Irene, partly because she started to connect with other people in her community, or local communities, someone would say, we know someone, and she started to have these conversations with others, outside of a therapy room. But she would bring in those conversations and we would talk about them together. And she began to see, more and more, that this was a terrible thing that had happened, and she wasn't alone, and that the profound guilt that she was experiencing was something that other people knew something about as well. 

00:22:25
Predating the Brief History of Psychotherapy 

00:22:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE What strikes me also about this story is, if you think about, uh, the beginning of psychotherapy as a profession, it's pretty young, actually. And, so what did people do before? They had no problems? Of course they did. But they talked with their neighbors, with their family, with their friends... 

00:22:45
PEGGY SAX Right. 

00:22:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE ....their community, their, uh, spiritual leaders and so forth. And so, in a way they're- uh, I really like this kind of expanding the domain of participation, in a therapeutic process. 

00:23:00
PEGGY SAX Yes. 

00:23:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE Where a therapeutic process may or may not include a therapist. 

00:23:05
PEGGY SAX Yes. That's right. 

00:23:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE Right? That, that, that there's, that these are, um, available resources for people. But we've become so compartmentalized in modern society that you wouldn't dare burden a friend with your problem, you pay somebody to listen to your problem. 

00:23:25
PEGGY SAX Yes. 

00:23:25
Expanding the Domain of Participation 

00:23:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE And the same with every other profession. You pay the specialist, the consultant, the this, the that, and then the relationships that you have stay intact, just as relationships. And, um, I think some of the implications of your neighborly ways of being is a beautiful example of a relational ethic that basically says, we don't need to leave it just in this, um, hierarchical, kind of sterile, professional-client relationship. That, that, that we can expand the domain. 

00:23:55
PEGGY SAX Yes, and accenting what you said earlier, that, um, it's always with choice. And not only choice in making an offering, but checking in to see how is this going, and um, and I, I can, uh, and that it's not about, um, a right or a wrong, it's about a ray of possibilities. And sometimes, um, those possibilities don't even come from me, but hopefully we open the space to talk about them. 

00:24:25
SHEILA MCNAMEE So Peggy, in- you know, we only have a little bit of time left, I wish we could continue talking for hours more, but is there another illustration, or another- anything else you want to add to this conversation? 

00:24:40
Suzanne and Jamie 

00:24:40
Sharing Their Story in the Hope It Will Help Someone Else 

00:24:40
PEGGY SAX Yeah, oh yeah. Well I always carry so many stories to want to tell, and um, and there is one that I've been given permission, um, to share and in fact this is from someone who very intentionally wishes us to use her name and her son's name. And her name is Suzanne, and her son's name is Jamie. And Jamie died four years ago, uh of an opiate, um, overdose. And um, she has, I could honestly say, is more of a teacher to me than I to her, um, in many ways. And, um, one of the things that she has taught me, is- she is such a great example of what, um- she began as novice, she began as a novice in terms of who knows what it's like to have a child die, you know, and early in his, uh, in his early adult life? What do you know about death, what do you- any of us know? Um, and she has, while of course she aches to have him back, she has taken this on to learn how to become a veteran of sorts, where she's giving back to other parents. Where she began to see that she needed to learn more about, um, uh, things that she could pass on. She created a, a book, she calls it the Jamie book, she creates, uh, heart art. Um, I, uh, when she told me this story, I interviewed her and, um, Patty, who is the director of our local hospice, and I realized that I, I really would love to come to her house and see, um, what she also had described as, um, as Jamie's garden, that she and her husband have created. He's Jamie's stepfather, and also Jamie's room, that includes what she calls her crying chair. And so I went to visit these, and was very moved to see how, while there may be some ways that I have helped her to, im- uh, to live with, uh, what's happened in her life, that she moves so much on, beyond what I could possibly give her. And now, um I, just in the last week, bumped into her, um, and ah, she was in the local food co-op, we both were, and talking in the aisle, and um, and I realized in that moment that four years before she had wondered how- in our conversation- how she could possibly step out back into the world. And now she's just so out there that we, um, we're like co-conspirators in our local community, um, and um, our relationship has changed. We're like soul friends. She's no longer my client, but I, I feel like our conversations have contributed. 

00:27:50
Soul Friends or Anam Cara in Gaelic 

00:27:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah. So that's another beautiful illustration of sort of the no-no, don't blur those boundaries between the professional-client relationship, and kind of a co- conspirator. 

00:28:05
PEGGY SAX Yeah. 

00:28:05
SHEILA MCNAMEE Um, and I mean, it illustrates many things, but also just sort of the ethic of being present for the other... 

00:28:10
PEGGY SAX Yeah. 

00:28:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE And paying attention to what you're making together. 

00:28:15
