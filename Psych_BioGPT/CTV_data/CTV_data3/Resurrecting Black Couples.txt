DR. BYRON WALLER Historically, using, using spirituality in counseling and our other helping professionals, have been very, very controversial. in fact spiritually and religion was not embraced by psychology or counseling for a long time. However, recently there has been a change. We used to, the training used to say to counselors you need remain to unbiased, you need to be objective, you need to be neutral. If the person wanted to talk about spirituality, allow them to do that but its not up to you to bring it up. In fact if they want to talk about it in a session, you continue to support them as they do so. But it’s not your focus in the counseling process. There has been a change, the counseling profession and other helping professionals have now changed their view, of embracing spirituality. They are now saying, it’s the counselors obligation to be willing to discuss in topics related to spirituality or religion if a client brings it in. A matter of fact, they are to talk about those positive and negative issues that may have impacted the individual, that have promoted to their psychological well being. So, so spirituality has now become a significant part in which counselors have integrated into the work that we do. For African Americans, spirituality is a very, very important part of their lives. In fact, between 67 and 75% of African Americans consider themselves to be spiritual or religious. In fact, if you look historically spirituality and religion have helped African Americans to survive during very, very difficult times. And it provides them with spaces of comfort and support in those difficult times. And, in fact, the Black church have been that place where African Americans will go in order to find support and to find resources in order to, in times of very difficulty. 

00:03:35
Byron Waller, Ph.D. 

00:03:35
DR. BYRON WALLER Now, this is a very difficult topic to talk about. Um, I am going to use this idea of Black and African American, interchangeably. So, it's important that you know that that I might use them uh, differently. And really the whole point my goal in talking about these issues is to help, helping professionals to better understand African Americans and African American couples, as they talk about spirituality. So, I am going to ask for those who are listening to put on their multi-cultural glasses. And put on their multi-cultural ear plugs, and make sure they can hear this from a multi-cultural perspective and not from a defective, or deficient perspective. Because sometimes our vision can be distorted, so lets make sure that we put on those multi-cultural glasses as we continue to talk about what spirituality might mean to African Americans and African American couples. You see, African Americans look at spirituality and religion in a particular way. Often times they see it from a Christian perspective, and of course all African Americans don't see it in one way. They are not a homogeneous group. There is always some change and difference within African Americans. But however, for the majority of people you can say, that spirituality is view in a particular way. But there is a way, and this way says that there is a relationship with god or transcendent force or power that will help to provide meaning, purpose, and direction in life. An extension of that spiritual idea is religion. Where religion is the expression of that spiritual idea. That god is involved in our lives, every day, and that I execute that and express that in what am I religious understanding. Counseling on the other hand, has often seen spirituality very, very, differently. Spirituality is seen as a way to begin to establish balance, and harmony in one's life. It is really a capacity and contingency, intendancy that they believe is innate and unique to every person. However, it also provides them with a tendency for love, meaning, peace, hope, transcendence, connection, passion and wellness. So, it allows for the individual to have a self actualized experience. Now, this is slightly different than how African Americans might see this whole idea of spirituality. Because African Americans often talk about this transcendence that connects to god, or a higher force. And basically in our training as professionals as counselors, and other helping professionals, we may not talk about the connection specifically with god. Again, make sure we put on our multi-cultural glasses, that we can hear this, or our ear plugs, so that we can hear this n the way that it is being presented. Because for African Americans, spirituality and religion being the same has been very, very important over time. And you know our history here in the United States, that for Black people, spirituality and religion has been the component that has been used in order to deal with years of oppression, years of racism years of discrimination, years of slavery. The way in which, many African Americans were able to sustain it, through those years of slavery, through years of Jim Crowe, was their connection to their spiritual part of them the spiritual part that allowed them to sustain themselves, and continue going when they even felt as if they had no control of their time, or control of their bodies, or control of anything. So spirituality has been this ability to sustain, for African Americans. They have served as a buffer, a buffer that allowed them to deal with life stressors that allowed them to deal with these emotional times, that they can turn to god to help them begin to deal with these other external stressors that they are using. So it has been a successful tool to sustain during these difficult times. Spirituality has provided African Americans with structure, with direction, it has provided opportunity for integration of the self. What that means internal and also externally whether they get involved in the church and they connected to other people. It has been important to contribute to the well being of African Americans, and the black church has been that place that African Americans could go, and express their spirituality, and have their cultural connectedness, to relieve stress, and to promote social change. Spiritually and African Americans are an important component that we have to make sure that we understand, as we begin to help them. Now, this idea of spirituality goes further than just looking at African Americans in general. It also begins to impact Black couples, African American couples. Because, just like every couple, who have to manage external factors and interpersonal factors, African American seems to, African American couples seem to have to deal with even more extreme types of issues. How then do they manage issues of racism when they are at work, or issues of discrimination when they are at work, and then have to bring that home. How does that now impact the interpersonal relationship that they have with their spouse or their partner? These are important issues to consider when we begin to, to work with couples. Because the issue of spirituality can be very helpful to deal with this, co they can come home but it can also provide them with really issues that they have to deal with that may be very different for them. So, we found though, couples who participate into religious activities and spiritual activities tend to be engaged more. They tend to report higher relationship quality than those who do not. So, we know, even with black couples, that spirituality can be very, very helpful not only to sustain them during difficult times, but can also help them in times in which, they are able to relate to each other in a very, very different way. Now, if we are talking about couples, we know that there may be, there are different ways in which African American women, deal with their spirituality and African American men express their spirituality. They do it in different ways. African American women for example, they tend to attend church more um, than African American men. They reported that they are more involved religious activities than African American men. They attend church, they frequently pray, they meditate more, they are more involved. And because of that involvement, African American women have found a comfortable place in which they can express their spirituality, but they can also express their leadership. Because now African American women are now leaders in the church, and they get an opportunity to express their spirituality. But on the other hand, African American men have experienced more difficult challenging times to express their spirituality. There was a time in which African American men were leaders of the church and expressing spirituality, look back to the 1960s, and 1970s. and we can see a lot of leaders during that time, coming from the church, were African American men. However, African American men have undergone, and have encountered some very, very difficult times. Very, very difficult times and dealing with high unemployment. High incarceration and involvement with the court system. Lower life expectancy. So many African American men are dealing with issues that are unique to them. In matter of fact, some would say, that it, that intersection between race and gender. Often that’s, do we call that intersectionalism, do you call that genderism? Many will say something has happened that African American men have not been getting any of those opportunities they, they may have in the past. And as a result, many African American men have been leaving the church, and have been looking for other ways to express their freedom and their power. And one of the places, and I usually joke, there are three places that African American men go to express themselves, one very clear, they go to the streets to do that. Number two, they go into the recording booth or the athletic field to express themselves. But we know that spirituality is as important for African American men, than it is with African American women. Because they take those things into the relationship. And when we begin to look at African American relationships and their spiritual ideas, there becomes some issues that are challenging. One of those issues is one of who is considered to be the head of the household? The second one is, how do you define roles that you operate within your relationship? To talk about the head of the household, then most, and children begin to see who's the person who's actually managing the household. And usually it is the African American women, it's not the African American men. So, and the man in often been displaced. Because even as we see relationships, we tend to see, many African American men tend to see god, man, and women. And so therefore, the man is ultimately on earth, responsible for making decisions, and responsible for the family. However, that’s not the experience we actually see, because the family structure has been very, very different. The second we begin to cope with, and deal with what type of role that you are going to have within those relationships. You know, we have a traditional role, where, men do certain things, and women do certain things. That is really not in the traditional things for the African American couples. Because African American women have always worked outside of the home. However, there is something very different now, African American women often work more than African American men, and African American women often make more money than African American men. That creates a problem for African American men. Then how then do you express power, how to you express leadership? It becomes one of those challenging issues that couples have to begin to work through. And as they begin to understand what the relationship might look like. So, how then do we help African American couples deal with these types of things? Well, one thing we can do, we can help them by helping them to learn to communicate to each other in a different way. We are realizing this is going to be some issues, We want to make sure that we have communication that is a major issue. Second thing we can do, is help them to begin to talk about how they are going to share power. So, you might have to teach more conflict resolution, in order to make sure we are clear about what power might look like. A third thing we can do, is learn how to allow, and this is a spiritual idea, allow for the spiritual part, the spirit of god that individuals say, to impact the relationship that the person might have. And those relationships means those external, and those internal, or interpersonally. Because they have to begin to learn how to negotiate the different roles that they have and how to negotiate getting their needs met. So, as hel0ing professionals, as I have asked you before, I asked you to make sure you put your multicultural glasses on, make sure you put your multicultural earphones on, so that you can hear this. That becomes important for us, as counselors, and helping professionals to make sure that we are competent to help African Americans integrate their spirituality into their lives. So what can we do? We can one, we can become more aware of our own view of spirituality. Number two, we can increase our knowledge on what African American spirituality and religious perspectives might look like. Number three, we can gain the necessary skills in order to better understand African Americans, and African American couples as they recognize the difference and similarities in their views. And finally, we can become more familiar with the different competencies, the spiritual competencies that are now developed in order to help all people who might have differing spiritual religious views. Thank you.

THERAPY Talks 

00:17:10
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:17:10
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Dr. Waller, thank you. I uh, I find spirituality and religion a little bit fascinating. Um, for African Americans, you said in the United States, it is predominantly Christianity. Of course there are other uh, faiths, and then of course there are many denominations within Christianity. 

00:17:35
DR. BYRON WALLER Yes. 

00:17:35
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D But overall, we are talking about not just religion, but spirituality. And how that has um, not just strengthened a lot of African Americans in their uh, turbulent history in the united states, um, but has been a source of coping and resilience and survival. And a lot of people would say now, well some of those things don’t exist anymore. Even though we can say they just exist in a different form, so why, why is it still so important to talk about some of these, to talk about some of these things? 

00:18:10
DR. BYRON WALLER well, one of the things that makes it really important is it helps you to better understand African Americans. If our role as counselors and helping professionals is to help people to make those necessary adjustments, we have to make sure that we understand them from a spiritual perspective too. As I mentioned for African Americans, there is no separation between that which is spiritual and that which is religious. It’s really seen as the same. So, it’s more like a um, a living of self, as I live myself, I express my spirituality through my religious involvement. So, and if we are in the place of helping people, that come in session, and they want to talk about you know, what happened at church, or they want to talk about this issue of hierarchy or they want to talk about this issue of roles, then we need to make sure that we understand what that really means to them. Because it be very, very difficult for, different for them, then it would be for someone else. so that makes it really imperative for us to understand. 

00:19:05
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Okay, uh I think in some ways, especially in the field of, the mental health field, you know uh, they've shy away from religion and spirituality, and for many reasons, and not just with African Americans, just in general. And you mentioned it briefly because old values, and thinks like that, um, of not bringing those into the counseling room, even though we could argue there are always there, whether you acknowledge them or not, uh, but there have been some topics that, in particular I think that clinicians have waited until clients brought them up. Spirituality, sexuality, uh, you've talked about financial issues that, you know, sometimes those aren’t brought up. So, um, but if we wait for clients, including spirituality, even if it’s very important to them, if we wait for them to bring it up, we might never overtly talk about it. so how do you suggest that people start the conversation about spirituality with their African American clients? 

00:20:00
DR. BYRON WALLER I think most African American clients whether couples or individuals, will be very open to talking about it. Especially if the person is pretty competent in their discussion. Um, because I think it will establish the connection and the value of what therapy is all about. You know, historically, African Americans have not used counseling and therapy very much. 

00:20:20
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D True. 

00:20:20
DR. BYRON WALLER And, also, it has not been, uh, they have not continued to use therapy, and counseling even after the first session. Well, this is an opportunity of really being able to help them to see that I am sensitive to where you are, and I understand uh, you in a different way. So, this can promote the use of what counseling, and therapy by showing sensitivity to their world view. 

00:20:50
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:20:50
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Do you think, you mentioned competency several times, do you think that the competencies, or how those competencies are used is different if its an African American uh, clinician versus a clinician of any other ethnicity or race? 

00:21:05
DR. BYRON WALLER I think they have to be used to saying, and that their competencies for everyone, cuz just because I am African American does not mean that I will understand the African American perspective of this other person. What I have to do, I have to continue to show sensitivity to their world view, I have to continue to be aware of what my view of spirituality is, and how that might impact my relationship with the person. I must make sure that I have knowledge necessary in order to have that discussion with the person, and I have to make sure I update my skills to make sure I am there, whether we are similar or we are different, the competencies are the same and we must make sure that we are clear in using them. 

00:21:45
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Okay, now you mentioned that oh ,just because the clinician and the couple might both be African American and both let’s say, Christian, that doesn’t mean that you express it in the same way. How would you encourage clinicians, cuz you are a supervisor also- 

00:22:00
DR. BYRON WALLER Yes. 

00:22:00
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D How would you encourage clinicians to explore that meaning more when there is actual, a lot of similarities between the two? 

00:22:10
Bryon Waller, Ph.D. 

00:22:10
DR. BYRON WALLER Well, and even as a teaching multiculturalism, you know, how you promote the idea that if you want to be multicultural competent you can’t just read your book. You actually have to be involved, and you have to actually go. One way is sometimes taking a, an excursion and going and experiencing something different that can help you to be more sensitive that you might be if you had not. Again, you can go online and do the necessary research, but nothing is as important as actually being there. I think that can help people to be more sensitive to the needs. Even though we might have a lot of similarities, so I think that’s one way. A second thing that we can do, is actually talk about it. because I think most people will be open to talk about it, not that they have to teach you about their particular perspective, but they can inform you about their particular way of looking at it. we know that African Americans, the largest um, percentage of African Americans are Baptist, and then after Baptist, you have Pentecostal, and so you have, and other, and Methodist. So, you have other denominations which have very similar beliefs. However, the specifics can be done as you talk to the person and they are able to tell you what they believe about their spiritual life, and how they express it in the world. 

00:23:25
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Okay, so, entering their world, whether that’s by visiting at church or going to a, you know, having other, some kind of other experience by asking, by just simply asking them. Not expecting your clients to teach you though. 

00:23:40
DR. BYRON WALLER Right. 

00:23:40
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D But more to share their world view and share their experiences, not to all of a sudden become the mouth piece for an entire race or religion, or spiritual perspective, but instead just to share part of who they are. 

00:23:50
DR. BYRON WALLER That’s an important piece to remember. Again, everyone must be competent and provide the standard of care. So, therefore, I am not asking for my clients to inform me about the world, I am making sure that I do my research, I find out what’s going on so that I can be sensitive to the person. That’s my role as the counselor. That’s my role as a helping professional, to do, to be prepared to be competent. And I must be multicultural competent if I am going to do cross cultural or multicultural types of work. 

00:24:20
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:24:20
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Okay, now here I think is the fear of a lot of people, about bringing up spirituality cuz it so core to a lot of people. And to a lot of people where they might be flexible in other areas, when you are talking about their faith, or their belief in how the faith should be expressed in the right way, it hits home a lot more. There’s not as uch, for a lot of people, flexibility in like oh, you can do it your way, and we can both be right. You know, so how would you help coach or supervise a clinician who has very strong faith in to um, discussing that with their clients, and letting their clients have a different view of the faith, of that faith? 

00:25:05
DR. BYRON WALLER I think that’s a really, really important, uh, uh, question to ask. Because really as counselors and as helping professionals, it’s really not about us. Its about the people who are coming for our help. So, you can have your beliefs, your ideas, you can bring it in the room with you, but it’s not the most significant reason why the person is there, you are there to be sensitive to what, and the needs of the person that you are working with. It’s not about what you are bringing, you can bring it in the room with you, or course, but it’s really not trying to prove to anyone, or even trying to uh, debate facts, its more about being supportive and being present for the person who is there for counseling. 

00:25:45
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D And I think that’s true, I think that’s harder said than done. Especially, let’s talk specifically about couples, cuz we've been talking about spiritually more in general. When there are different views about male and female roles, when there is different views about how sexuality should be expressed in um relationships, based on a spiritual view. When there is different uh, about power in spirituality, how especially specifically for couples, can um, how do you help clinicians get passed some of that very differing views on gender roles, or on parenting, or on sexuality, and how that’s expressed and informed by spirituality? 

00:26:25
DR. BYRON WALLER I think you definitely chose one of those very difficult uh- 

00:26:30
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D I did, and you have like two minutes to answer. 

00:26:30
Dr. Byron Waller, Ph.D. 

00:26:30
DR. BYRON WALLER right, uh, to talk about when um working with couples and issues of spirituality, cuz that’s very sensitive spot. And that’s why we talked a little bit about of helping the communication process. Cuz one of the things that often happens is that, when you discuss somethings that’s very sensitive, the other person doesn’t really hear what the other person is saying. So therefore, communication is really important. Especially establishing a space of safety and security where we can actually talk about it. I think the second thing is, the negotiate, the negotiation part. Conflict resolution. Because, again, how can I hear what you have to say, but also communicate what I feel about things? So, it’s actually teaching skills in order to have that discussion, and how to have the relationship that’s needed. So, that’s the second thing. And the third, I think a skill that is really necessary, is to recognize that I need to be sensitive to where the other person is. And I can hear their point of view, and I can try to integrate that into the relationship that I said that I want. If I want to have a relationship, this is important then to them, and I want to make sure that I can hear that. 

00:27:45
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D We only have a little bit of time left but I want you to, this is really a hard one to answer quickly, but I am going to ask you to do it. You’re up to it. how can spirituality be misused sometimes within the couple? 

00:28:00
DR. BYRON WALLER Especially when, well it can be misused especially when the person is dogmatic about what they may have perceived or experienced, and they are not willing to negotiate that within the relationship. It can act as, what Gotman might say is stonewalling, as a wall, between the couple, and therefore negatively impacting the relationship. 

00:28:25
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Okay, good so spirituality can be used as a way not to be open to influence, or turn away from your partner, and then there aren’t those negotiating things that you that you talked about. Uh, we are out of time. I know we could probably talk about this a lot longer. But, I want to thank you for that fascinating information, of talking about spirituality in general, but then specifically with African American couples. I want to thank all of you for joining us, if your interested uh, in this topic, or other topics by Dr. Waller, or other experts, please check out the Alexander Street Press website, where you can see more therapy talks. Uh, thank you for joining us, and thank you for talking about a very interesting and sometimes difficult topic Dr. Waller.
