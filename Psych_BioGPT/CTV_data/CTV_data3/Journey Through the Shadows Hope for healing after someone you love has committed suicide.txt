SUZANNE WHIPP 

00:00:40
Sister of Gerry who died of Suicide 

00:00:40
SUZANNE WHIPP Gerry was about 10 years younger than me. So, I didn't hang around with him as much I do with my older siblings. Umm… so he almost like a, he was a baby brother. 

00:00:55
CLAUDETTE LEBLANC 

00:00:55
Sister of Gerry who died of Suicide 

00:00:55
CLAUDETTE LEBLANC I think he looked up to me to a certain extent, because he was the youngest and I was the oldest in the family. 

00:01:05
SUZANNE WHIPP Gerry was… I describe Gerry, great sense of humor, uh… but I think a very problemed uh… person inside, uh… I think his way of coping was his sense of humor. I think he held a lot of stuff inside, I think he tried very hard to, to make the things that were wrong, right, but wasn't able to do so. He didn't take a lot of pleasure in like I said the outdoors umm… he was a good friend to a lot of people. 

00:01:40
WREN ROSS Gerry was a good friend to many people and he loved his family, but he hid his internal emotional pain from them. On a snowy night, 1 January, Gerry, age 27, hanged himself in his parent's garage.

STEPHANIE WEBER This was my mothers table and sat in my house for many, many years. It was actually uncovered in her basement I had refinished. And the day I got the phone call from my sister, umm… she called and said mom, hasn't been to work for two days and the school district just called me and she said I can't do this again, meaning that 2 years prior to that my mother had her first and only other attempt and it was my sister who found her. So when she called I said well, you're gonna need to call the minister. I said you cant go to the house by yourself. So it was a very long 15 minutes and my sister called back and she said, "You have to come home." And I said, "Why?" She said, "Mother is dead, you have to come home."

00:03:00
IRIS M. BOLTON My husband and I were rearing four sons. One was 22, one was 20, one was 16 and one was 14. And on February 19th, umm… Mitch chose, his name was Curtis Mitch O Bolton, he choose to give up on life. He shot and killed himself in his bedroom of our home. That event changed our lives. I mean, it was just like this bomb was dropped, all the pieces flew up in the air and they all came down in different places with a missing piece, huge missing piece.

The initial impact of the death 

00:03:45
IRIS M. BOLTON I stormed into the hospital and I don't know how I found it, whether it was by divine guidance or what I don't know. I found the room, because they were pulling me back and saying, please don't do that, don't go in and I said I have to, he's my son. I found the room, opened the door and he was on a breathing machine and so his chest was going up and down and I said he's alive and the nurse said no he's not, he's on a breathing machine, so he's kidneys can be donated. And it was like, well, of course, but he's alive, I couldn't get it. 

00:04:20
CLAUDETTE LEBLANC Biggest impact was when my father call, called and told me about it. Umm… the finality of it and how helpless you feel and you can't change it and you can't bring them back and it's too late. 

00:04:35
[music] 

00:04:40
SUZANNE WHIPP It may give shock when somebody says to you… …your brother has hung himself. I was shocked, but not surprised. 

00:04:50
IRIS M. BOLTON You feel like you have caused this horror and you're in shock, so you don't really don't know what you're doing. Some people in shock get hysterical and scream and carry on and some people are like catatonic. They don't know what's happened they just kind of, if someone says sit down, they sit down. 

00:05:10
STEPHANIE WEBER The first and most important challenge is to try to continue to function in a world that recognize death, in a world that gives us three days off and we are supposed to return and act normal. The emotions are so tough and they come sometimes when we least expect them. I've had a survivor say, I feel like I've been punched in the stomach. I can go along and think I'm doing okay I think I look normal, I think I don't have a big S printed on my forehead and I may hear a song that triggers my tears. Things will eventually get better that if they work at their grief, if they cry when they need to, if they get angry when they need to, that things will get better and that excruciating pain, their first experiencing will eventually go to just a debtor pain and eventually a dull ache, but that it will take hard work in years.

00:06:40
The question of why 

00:06:45
IRIS M. BOLTON A mother came to my office a couple of years after that and said to me, what I think is the best analogy of why? She said, "It's like a cup of water that sits on the table full to the brim. It's even rounded and it is so full. As it sits there it doesn't spill. If you add one drop more or two, it spills over." Now, we are a culture that wants to blame, so we're going to blame the drops of water. The reality is you can put drops of water in an empty cup and it doesn't spill. So cant just be the drops of water, its got to be all the water that's there and the drops both end. So if you apply that to this, all the pain in that persons life or failure, their shame, their guilt and whatever all that is that builds and accumulates never gets dealt with or talked about, but accumulates and then it's full and the person feels like they're just about drowning and then another drop or two could be a smaller thing as a, A student who gets a B, it could be a breakup of a girlfriend, boy friend relationship. That's not what causes it, that's like the last straw of the last drop of water. 

00:07:55
SUZANNE WHIPP I went to through his room and I looked for why he did it right then? What happened at that moment that caused him to do that? And I'm ultimately though I really, it was something that he had problems and mother had been one situation or another. Umm… most people, I think that a lot of people, I mean, I obviously believe is suicide prevention, because I do it. Uh… but I also believe a lot of people, if they don't, you know, get the kinds of help that they need, even when you're aware, you cant really do anything for them, they have to do it for themselves and I think Gerry had, didn't do that. 

00:08:45
WREN ROSS Because of her own internal struggles, Claudette felt she could understand why her brother killed himself. 

00:08:55
CLAUDETTE LEBLANC I never made an attempt, but I planned several different ways of ending my life and, and it's because I was in a lot of pain, internal pain uh… that I really couldn't understand and I knew no way to resolve. So, you really think it's so, you're this, you're bad, there's something wrong with you. Whatever it is, it goes on in your head at a time like that and umm… when I realized how serious I was, I did seek professional help and it did take a number of years for me to come to terms with what I was feeling and why I was feeling the way I was. Uh… which, I mean, that's a journey and that was a very fulfilling journey to come to learn about myself and certainly a relief not to feel like you want to end your life. I knew that he was in a great deal of pain and I understood his pain, umm… the only thing that I understood that he didn't understand was there, there was a way of resolving that pain. 

00:10:10
SUZANNE WHIPP I think people commit suicide for many different reasons. But, what I think is I, they don't know, they at least perceive that they don't have a lot of choices or the choices they have are very umm… very troubling the choices they had, they were, they were multiple or very few. Suicide was a choice that they made. 

00:10:35
STEPHANIE WEBER In the beginning it's, it's a question that we all ask and it's important to keep asking that question until you don't need to ask it anymore. So, even if I were to say to someone. It's really not important why they're dead, you've had a, or lost someone you loved is dead umm… that doesn't help. So, what I say is you can continue to look for reasons and answers. 

00:10:55
SUZANNE WHIPP He was feeling things and none of us will ever, ever understand. What he was feeling at that moment, when he did it, none of us will know exactly. You know, I kind of have an idea and I think that you gotta let it go and just say, "You'll never know for sure that, you know, that's, that's theirs."

00:11:45
Feelings of guilt 

00:11:50
IRIS M. BOLTON I went through the guilt trying to figure out why this attractive, popular, charming, beautiful young man would end his life? His girlfriend broke up with him three weeks prior to this. I knew he was grieving about that. He sit at his piano, a big, beautiful grand piano that his uncle had loaned him and tears would stream down his cheeks and I thought that was the breakup of the girlfriend. That seemed like a natural thing and I would sit beside him and put my arm around him and say it hurts, doesn't it? And he would say, "Yeah, it does." But, I think he had a deeper hurt that I didn't grasp, because he was a good actor. He didn't really want me and he would play the piano and tears would just stream. 

00:12:35
[music] 

00:12:40
CLAUDETTE LEBLANC I did feel guilty about it, because I felt that I had uh… experienced similar feelings and had umm… worked with those feelings to overcome them to learn about why I felt that way and how I could resolve umm… the pain and umm… I didn't really share that with Gerry. 

00:13:05
STEPHANIE WEBER Guilt can do terrible things to people and if they don't talk about the guilt and I guess I always tie it to the anger. Why do people get sick from that? They get intestinal problems, they could have Crohn's disease, colitis, migraine, headaches. So it's really good to keep talking about that. Well, why didn't I see this? Well, why didn't I see that? Because, every time a survivor tells their story over and over again, it's like an iceberg. A little piece breaks off and floats away. 

00:13:30
[music] 

00:13:35
CLAUDETTE LEBLANC I wish I would have done things differently or said something that might have made a difference or umm… you always think after the fact or what if? What if? You know, maybe, maybe that sort of thing. And maybe something might have helped and maybe it wouldn't have. I realized that too. 

00:13:55
WREN ROSS You cannot take on the full responsibility for your loved ones suicide. It was your loved one's choice to bring life to an end. 

00:14:00
STEPHANIE WEBER And I also like to say to a survivor, you can take a portion of the guilt, a very tiny portion, but I can't allow you to take it all. Because, that then puts you in a god like position, all- knowing all- seeing and there isn't where we are as human beings. 

00:14:20
CLAUDETTE LEBLANC I think so for the most part, I've resolved my guilt feelings. Umm… I mean, I, you know, did a lot of just self… just going through my own healing of, of his death and umm… I felt that that too for the most part, I was limited in what my input was with Gerry as far as what he did or didn't do. Because, I, at least made the attempt, I probably could have pushed a little bit more, but I think that ultimately umm… suicide is a decision of the person who, who, umm… does commit the act. Umm… even people who have had counseling sometimes still will umm… resort to suicide unfortunately. So, I, I really don't feel guilty about it anymore. I feel sad about it and I don't feel guilty about.

Suicide is about pain 

00:15:55
STEPHANIE WEBER Suicide is not about you. Suicide is about me. Suicide is about my pain. For you talk about a parent dying, that parent, my mother for example, I'm sure, I thought, yes we're going to feel bad for a while, but we will go on with our lives. Umm… and I guess that's what I keep saying the survivors. You know, how could they do this to me? Well, they didn't do anything per say, to you, they weren't out to get you. 

00:16:30
IRIS M. BOLTON It's about their pain, it's about their accumulation of pain that never gets dealt with, builds and builds and builds until finally the last couple of things go wrong, maybe a last couple of straws and they can't tolerate the pain anymore. 

00:16:45
WREN ROSS Gerry's suicide was a catalyst for Suzanne's present volunteer work in suicide prevention. Many of the people she works with experience depression. 

00:16:55
SUZANNE WHIPP I work with a lot of people as a social worker and experience a lot of depression and I understand suicide and the impact it has on people's lives, it's just unbelievable. Now, if people felt like that when they were doing this, if people who knew, when they ask me, you know, do you make suicide, actually stop it, though about the people that they were effecting. I don't think they'd do it. I think that would stop them. But, I, really don't I really don't believe that they stop and think about that. They are enemies of their own, hating at that time. 

00:17:30
STEPHANIE WEBER They don't know the enormous pain that they leave behind. Their pain has been transferred to the shoulders of those left behind.

00:18:20
SUZANNE WHIPP It was when I was first told and when I had to tell people and I had to call people that night. Every time I go to say it, like, I'm getting now, 'cause everybody would say, "How?" 

00:18:35
CLAUDETTE LEBLANC Telling my son was really… That was all for… I think, because it reinforced the, the reality of what had just happened to have to tell him, he was about and I think he was around 12 at the time. 

00:18:55
STEPHANIE WEBER I remember telling someone who really didn't need to know my story, because it was not someone I knew real well, but it was several years after my mother died and we had worked together and were getting ready to go home and she said, "Well, I bet you're going to spend Christmas with your parents." And I said, "I hope not." Well, then she said, "Why do you say that?" And I said, "Both of my parents are dead." "Oh, well, how did they die?" And I said, "Their heart stopped." It was a decision a survivor makes. Did, did those women need to know that? No, but she was, she kept on her mission. Well, I mean how did they die? And I thought, well, right you've asked for it, so, I, I mean I was trying to protect her in a sense, I said, "Well, my father died after a long illness of emphysema. And my mother killed herself." And she visibly stepped back from me and I stepped forward and touched her arm and said. "Don't worry, it isn't catching." 

00:19:50
WREN ROSS It is your decision about what you want to tell people about your loved ones suicide and what you do not want to tell them. 

00:20:00
STEPHANIE WEBER I have a young widow in the group now. Her son was ten months old when her husband took his life in their home and she says, you'd be amazed, she'll go places umm… where's your husband for example, she was signing her child up for preschool. "I'm a widow." "Oh, how did your husband die?" Well, they expect to hear car accident, cancer. She says, "He died from suicide." They don't know what to do with it. But she says, "I find myself consoling them saying it's okay, you can talk about it." And survivors need to do that, that's taking that shame and embarrassment and that stigma that they out there put on us 

00:20:35
SUZANNE WHIPP To have experience that, it's really hard to understand and most people don't know, most people tend to people tend to avoid it and they may do say something, they are probably saying the wrong thing, because they just don't know what to say. Most people do not understand suicide and they feel so, it's such an uncomfortable umm… thing to talk about and I think it's because it always hits too close to him, because it can't happen to anybody.

Journey through the shadows of your grief 

00:21:40
[music] 

00:21:45
IRIS M. BOLTON It's like standing on the edge of an ocean and one wave will come in and knock you down pick you up and dump you down. You get back up and you stand there again and another wave comes in, just jostles you, you think, "Okay, I'm better now." Another wave barely touches your ankles. You think, "Okay, I think I'm, I'm okay." And another wave then comes and knocks you down again, picks you up, dumps you down. So it's that kind of wave upon wave and some are worse and some are better and as time goes on, they get fewer and farther between. 

00:22:15
SUZANNE WHIPP There were a lot of times when I was very emotional, but they were scattered like, I said I could be driving down a road with him, never lost, the helpless is the person feels because, you know, there's nothing that we can do umm… if someone chooses to do this. 

00:22:35
STEPHANIE WEBER Like I say, there are survivors who say the first thing I'm going to do when I see him again is to shake him and slap him and say, "Why did you do this to our family?" So there's enormous amounts of anger. I get concerned, let's say a survivor is a year after the death when they continue to say, "Oh, I could never be angry at her, at her." Well, you know what you have to get angry with that person, because they have changed your life forever. They chose to leave your world, this was not an accidental death. 

00:23:05
SUZANNE WHIPP When this happened, it stood with me for a long time. It was very heavy on me for a long time. I couldn't change it. I had to come to grips with that, I had to come to grips with the fact that I, I, I realized that Gerry could do this and then Gerry did do this and I wasn't able to do anything about it. Even though I was more or even may be most umm… and that's hard, but I really do feel that ultimately you reach a point of acceptance partially, because you have no choice. Umm… but, also because we I knew these people, people would do this including my brother made a choice. 

00:23:45
[music] 

00:23:50
CLAUDETTE LEBLANC It took a number of months, maybe about six months before I could put some of it to rest. Umm… I think it's a daily thing as you go through it you realize that the pain that you're going through one day is a little bit less than the day before and that helps you realize that yes, you will get through this, if, if you can see the difference from day to day umm… and of course something that I don't feel you'll will ever get over, but you learn to live with and, and hopefully learn from the experience. 

00:24:25
STEPHANIE WEBER We have, had another couple that drove an hour and a half every month to come to our group, because there was no group in their area and as we would go around the circle there, were a couple things I have I noticed. The first one was, it was always he that would say my name is, I'll say John. Our son Brian, they say our son Brian killed himself. His wife would never do the intro and I ask him. So, why does Jean never do that and she laughed and said, because the way you go around the circle he comes first. I mean it was such a simple answer. Okay, so the next month I go the other way and I get to her first, she just turns like this to him and he does it. So after a year, she still was not able to do that. The next meeting we just sat and waited. And she sobbed and she sobbed and she sobbed and we wait and she was finally able to say it. 

00:25:25
IRIS M. BOLTON I went to a workshop one day and this woman was the leader and she said there were four things you needed to do in healing after grief and after a trauma. The first was you had to tell the story and in the telling of it, it is integrated into your being into your soul, you believe the truth of it, because it would be very easy to pretend it didn't happen so you have to face the truth of it. The second thing is to express the emotions whether that's anger, rage, guilt umm… shame, depression to tell somebody about it or write it out, scream it out, talk it out, get it out of you. The third thing is to make meaning out of the horror umm… and I think, I think that's why I'm talking to you because it makes meaning, if I can help one other person who's going through it in his fresh into it and they can look and say, "Well, she made it. Maybe I can." The fourth thing is to transition from the physical presence of the person to another kind of connection be that memories or be that a spiritual connection that some people have. 

00:26:40
STEPHANIE WEBER A year and a half ago, after working a year and creating it, our group came up with the design with the help of a jeweler for jewelry and I got this pendant which is an S at the top, a heart which state you know they are forever in our hearts and S at the bottom and we also have a picture pin and people have found this to be very comforting as well. For survivors when we talk about what they can do to help themselves umm… I've heard some very neat things over the years is, I mean, I wish someone had said to me, save some of her clothes to wear or to smell. Umm… survivors often will wear the jacket, the sweater, the slacks, mothers will often wear their son's clothes for quite a while and that's okay. Or they'll have a special piece of jewelry made. Someone had, something made out of roses into a necklace. Umm… or they'll wear a pin that has some special meaning to that person or carry their money clip. That's all okay, we get asked sometimes at the meeting, you know, is that sick. That's definitely not, there's nothing wrong with it, it makes us feel closer to the person and I want survivors to know that.

STEPHANIE WEBER The young widow I talked about who had a ten month old, it's been two years, a little over two years since her husband died and she said, "First of all when I, when my mother told me there was a group and offered to come with me I thought she was nuts." She said, "Then when I walked in and this is a good initial reaction to the group and I saw people laughing and talking. I thought what is wrong with these people." It's very again, it's very healing for people to realize that they will heal and be able to laugh and, and talk and be social Again. 

00:29:15
CLAUDETTE LEBLANC Hi, you look very pretty today. When your own people have something in common like that and you're not alone in it, umm… I think it does tend to relieve you of some of the guilt that you experience or it makes you understand why they did what they did or why you're feelings the guilt that you're feeling puts things into perspective more so when you know you're not alone in such a situation. 

00:29:40
STEPHANIE WEBER Survivor in the group said, you know, I feel like my parents, I mean, my friends divorced me. Some of my family, they will say divorced me. These are people who say I don't want to hear it anymore. Umm… I can't stand to be around you. I mean, when people will say this, you're sad all the time I can't stand to be around you and I kind of normalize that for a new survivor and say this is what happened to this person umm.. it seems to be that sometimes that's what happens, but then you will also find different friendships in a support group, it's almost like a new group of friendships spring up born out of that but maybe have more of a solid foundation. 

00:30:20
SUZANNE WHIPP I really believe that getting through this, the biggest thing and getting through this is being able to share it with the people umm… that's ultimately, I mean, the way that I had gone through it.

IRIS M. BOLTON For me having lost a 20 year old son, it was very important for me eventually maybe, two, three years down the road to not only survive it, but to thrive again somehow to, to live again. For a while, I just barely was holding on with my fingertips. Umm… there were times I wanted to die in the beginning. I just didn't think I could live with this kind of pain and that was the closest I ever got to the pain of my son. What must have caused him to do this. 

00:31:45
STEPHANIE WEBER Remember that you loved this person very much and this person loved you. The fact that they took their lives again, I have to come back to say had nothing to do with you and everything to do with them and their pain. You will Come to a point where you will carry that person in your heart. You'll will be able to talk about that person, you will be able to tell good stories as well as bad stories and the tragic stories and you will survive. 

00:32:20
SUZANNE WHIPP Be patient with what you're feeling, because it takes a long time. Uh… try not to blame yourself… that's what you're going to do. Try not to, because ultimately person who took their life is, is responsible for taking their lives uh… be the time. 

00:32:40
STEPHANIE WEBER You're not going to die from this, sometimes you wish you would, but you're not going to. You're going to work on your grief and you're going to move forward and you're gonna come to a different level of understanding in your life. It's actually in some ways better than where you were before.

Why is suicide difficult to talk about? 

00:34:20
IRIS M. BOLTON Think that the stigma uh… about suiciders comes from history partly. It comes from ancient times when in England they would drag the person who died by suicide through the streets and bury them at a crossroads with a stick through the heart so that the ghost wouldn't escape. 

00:34:40
STEPHANIE WEBER Initially suicide was viewed as okay, now I'm talking before Christ, if you'd lost all of your money for example, it was okay to kill yourself. That went on for a while. In fact the fortress of Masada, it's where I think there were 700 Jews who chose mass suicide. The Catholic Church came into play here that's again we go back to where suicide was condemned umm… its self murder, no thou shall not kill including yourself. 

00:35:10
IRIS M. BOLTON There's still a stigma about suicide, we're changing that by talking like the program you're doing. We are making a difference and helping the stigma to be reduced but probably there'll always be some stigma because people will say what's wrong, you know, why did they do it umm… there's just a stigma it's hard to erase that and yet I take part in the fact that cancer had a stigma to it nobody will admit or mention, mention that they had cancer years ago. I don't know if you remember that and. Now, people are not ashamed there's no stigma attached to having cancer, who have cancer. So, we're hoping that people will be able to talk about suicide.

00:35:55
How is suicide different from other death experiences? 

00:36:05
SUZANNE WHIPP I've experienced that with death umm… my mother and she died of Lou Gehrig's disease. Uh… that I, I had a grandmother died and I mean, I've experienced the death, but it doesn't compare to what you experience with suicide. It's a just a totally different experience. Suicide is shocking, you're not expecting it and then there's so many feelings that come along with it that they just don't exist with other types of death umm… the guilt, uh… the uncertainty as to why this person did it? What led up to it? Umm… people don't talk about it, it's like sshh… 

00:36:45
STEPHANIE WEBER Suicide is a unique death because it, it's like a, a car crash. It comes out of the blue for many people. I mean, there's no warning that survivors pick up on right away. It's an instant death. There's not time to prepare, there's no time to say goodbye. 

00:37:00
IRIS M. BOLTON There is probably more searching, questioning, struggle with why? The right much made… to more guilt. If there doesn't seem to be a logical reason, then I must have done something wrong, so you take it on family members and friends and loved ones take it on personally. So there's this awful, uh… grandiose, assuming it's all your fault. 

00:37:30
SUZANNE WHIPP Letting someone commit suicide… to me it's a tragedy. It's, it's, it's an unnatural, sad ending to someone's life. Not just the suicide itself but the fact, one of the things that haunted me was that people feel badly enough to do that in the first place. 

00:37:55

00:38:00
how does a survivor feel during their grief after a loved one has committed suicide? 

00:38:10
IRIS M. BOLTON It's like standing on the edge of an ocean and one wave will come in and knock you down, pick you up and dump you down and you get back up and you stand there again and another wave comes in and just jostles you, you think okay, I'm better now, another way barely touches your ankles. You think okay, I think I'm okay and another. Wave then comes and knocks you down again picks you up dumps you down, so it's that kind of wave upon wave and some reverse and some are better as time goes on they get fewer and farther between. 

00:38:45
CLAUDETTE LEBLANC Took a number of months, maybe about six months before I could put some of it to rest umm… I think it's a daily thing as you go through it you realize that the pain that you're going through one day is a little bit less than the day before and that helps you realize that yes, you will get through this if you can see the difference from day to day. Umm… and of course something that I don't feel you'll will ever get over but you learn to live with and, and hopefully learn from the experience. 

00:39:20
SUZANNE WHIPP Many death processes certain feelings that you go through but with the suicide, there are, there are different feelings there are the guilt's and the… I would not have spent so much time searching, I must say searching for clues but did went searching for clues, but we did, we went and we were searching for clues in spite, but we, we already know we were searching for answers for, why he did this? You don't go through them with them, you know, a typical death. 

00:39:45
STEPHANIE WEBER For someone who's lost someone to suicide, they think that they have suicide on their forehead and they think that others look at them and say, for example, if it's a husband you must have been a pretty lousy wife, if it's a parent, you must've been a pretty terrible child, if it's a child you were a terrible parent. We think as survivors that those other people out there think we could have stopped it. We could have prevented it if we tried harder, It'd been better, whereas you know with my neighbor whose mother died of cancer, there's nothing that she could do about that, but you Stephanie your mother died from suicide so why couldn't you have prevented this? We think everyone else views us as being responsible.

00:40:35
DO's and DON'Ts when caring for survivors of suicide 

00:40:40
STEPHANIE WEBER People will say to me, I mean, this happens to me all the time, they'll say, "Well, I don't go to wakes and funerals, because I don't know what to say but you Stephanie, we don't, I don't have the perfect answer either." I think the best thing to do in a case like that is to if you can catch yourself and you say, "Okay this isn't about me, they're are talking about their pain and to say something oh, my gosh I'm so sorry." Umm… do you want to talk to me about it? How did this happen? Some people can't do that, so I say give them a hug take them by the hand and say, "Gosh, I don't know what to say to you." Parents are often told, "Well, you have other children." It's God's will, umm… no I don't think God sits up there and says, "Okay it's time now you're going to kill yourself." Those are not helpful things or you'll get married again. We've had widows say that people have said that to them days after, "Oh don't worry, you're young you'll get married again." That's the farthest thing from a widow's mind. Siblings, we have other brothers and sisters. What we think that everyone in our life is unique. 

00:41:50
IRIS M. BOLTON Don't give advice, don't give advice… well, what you need to do is go out to lunch. What you need to do is get a good hobby. They may not want to hear that it may be true but they don't want to hear that in the beginning. 

00:42:05
SUZANNE WHIPP Sometimes people think, you know, like that people have a tendency of saying, meaning well, things you know well and I even say it now I do I believe that is at peace now. But, at that time I want to hear that you know I mean I was really angry. So I didn't want to hear that gives that peace at that time. The other thing is religion, religion umm… people are, it's just the, the reason you're brought in and brought up to believe that he committed suicide, you don't know how? And I, that was something that they came up. Not, not, not, beg or anything. But the crap we can't hold out that. 

00:42:50
IRIS M. BOLTON Be respectful of the pain and if you invite someone to go do something, let's go to a movie and they say. "No, I really can't do that." Don't ask them for a reason why? Just say, "Okay, I'll ask you again later. Maybe later." But don't push them, because a lot of times survivors will try to please the person that's trying to get them out of the House and they'll go and then they'll be miserable. 

00:43:10
STEPHANIE WEBER You need to treat this death as a death. People will say to me well, do I send flowers to, you know, I said, "What you do on a normal death? You send flowers, you go to the wake, umm… you take food to the family." Those are all the things you need to do, your friend is feeling additional, shit, embarrassment and shame possibly that this happened. So, the best thing you can do is treat this like a normal death and go ahead and ask questions. You know, I feel terrible that this is happened to you umm… I'm here for you. I want to hear when you're ready to talk to me. 

00:43:50
CLAUDETTE LEBLANC They allowed me to talk, they allowed me to share, umm… when without judgment umm… that really I think when you when you're talking about what you're feeling it kind of puts things into perspective for you so that helped me a lot when people who are open to my sharing, my experience and my thoughts and my feelings umm… and especially if they shared experiences umm… that kind of reinforces that to my feelings are appropriate or I mean they, they, it makes sense why I'm feeling the way I'm feeling. 

00:44:35
IRIS M. BOLTON I remember going to church one time and this woman stopped me in the doorway and said, "I never forget the night I came to church." And I was picking up something that I was going to do for the next morning early and it was bad midnight and everybody had keys back in those days to our church and she said, "I heard Mitch playing piano and I sat in the back pew and listed for an hour to him play his beautiful music." 

00:45:00
[music] 

00:45:15
IRIS M. BOLTON Well that was a thrill to me it was just a thrill and she would stop and taken the time to tell me that story about Mitch 

00:45:25
SUZANNE WHIPP It wasn't anything anyone specifically did except just letting me express without his feeling, without a lot of comment. 

00:45:35
IRIS M. BOLTON Main thing they can do for other people is to listen to them, hear their pain, not try to take it away or fix it. Umm… not try to take away the guilt. Because you hear people say, "Oh, you shouldn't feel guilty it wasn't your fault." But if the person feels guilty they feel it. 

00:45:55
CLAUDETTE LEBLANC Call, call them don't just, the worst part is after all of the funeral arrangements and all that is all over and done with, umm… they'll need contact now and then. Not to just be by themselves all the time, don't be afraid to talk or to be with these people and it was because it is very painful and you're bringing up a painful uncomfortable situation, but let the other person decide whether or not they want to pursue this or not. 

00:46:35
STEPHANIE WEBER A girlfriend from high school had written me a card, she was living in California, I was living in Indiana and it helps so much that she said you know, she told Good stories about my mother and said I was so shocked to hear the news, I can't imagine the kind of pain that you're feeling and then when I had to tell some good stories. That helps enormously. It helped me to know that again my mother was not going to be defined by the fact that she killed herself, but that someone was looking at her total life. 

00:47:05
CLAUDETTE LEBLANC Friends of Gerry who shared things about him and how they cared about him, in fact, I remember at the, at the wake, all the people that were there because of him and I'm going my God, all these people that cared about him and my sister commented yes, but he didn't care about himself, he didn't love himself, they loved him, but the feeling wasn't mutual umm… that's really sad that's really tragic, but then being there and talking about Gerry, crying for his loss umm… to know that all these people cared about him was helpful to me. It made it a little less… pointless in a way. 

00:47:55
IRIS M. BOLTON And the anniversaries are really important, friends can remember those anniversaries, friends can remember the death day, umm… birthdays are important. It, it's like that person is gone from everybody else's world but the family members and loved ones remember every day.
