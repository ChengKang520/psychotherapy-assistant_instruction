The Evolution of Psychotherapy Welcome! The 7th Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference The World's Largest Psychotherapy Conference Anaheim, California â€¢ 2013 

00:00:00
 Okay, so we can start on another session with one of the legends of the field. Uhm, the counseling association really call him a living legend I have been reading, uhm, and he is speaking about how to become a master therapist and I think, uhm, he is knowing a lot about this topic. He, uhm, would use a lot of DVDs with all the important-- of most of the important people in the field learning from them and we can learn from these DVDs. Uhm, and also the American Psychological Association honored him with, uhm, career achievement award. So, I will sit a little bit in the background and not on the same level and trying to learn how to become a master therapist. So please. 

00:01:00
JON CARLSON Thank you. Thank you, thank you. I'm gonna start out sitting here, if I can, just because I think it's what we don't do enough of, you know, we, we, you know, wo-- not sitting but, ah, this idea of having a contact with one another, ah, and, and I just think we use way too much media. And that, that the media tends to make us lonely and more distant from one another and, ah, this is about connections. That's what this, ah, this work we do is all about. Ah, I wanna start with a-- just a little disclaimer, ah, that-- I, I've studied Master Therapy for the last five years, ah, and it's culminated in the publication of a couple of books. The ones here, it's, it's on The Work of A Master Therapist with a colleague of mine, Len Sperry, who's a medical doctor and a psychologist at Florida Atlantic University and another colleague, ah, Jeffrey Kottler and he and I have done a book that'll be out in the spring called Becoming a Master Therapist. And, ah, a-- when I make a presentation, it's not just for me, it's really from them because, ah, both of those gentlemen have worked really, really hard on this as well so I'm kind of, ah, designated spokesperson, ah, for those fellows. Ah, on the website there is references for those books as well as other books that I'm gonna be referring to and talking about today. So, I'd like to begin with, you know, how does a sickly, you know, immature kid from Chicago get on the main stage here in Anaheim of a profession, you know, and, yeah, it's a puzzle, ah, and I really tried to figure that out as I've, ah, you know, prepared for this particular conference. Some of you saw the, the blurb, this, ah, Lake Woebegone effect, you know, that, ah, therapists tend to, you know, what like in Lake Woebegone isn't it all of our children are above average and, ah, and if you ask therapists, they're all above average which I thought was really, you know, you know, very, very interesting. Ah, I think it's certainly statistically impossible. Ah, so, if you're here to learn about master therapy and everybody thinks they're above average, you probably think that I'm gonna be talking about you this morning, ah, but it might not be the case. So, what is a master therapist and how does one become a master therapist? Ah, it's something to think about. Ah, you might really be surprised with the answer that I'm gonna give you today. I think clearly we can all agree there are some people who are better than others which, you know, that you've seen some people that really are true masters. We've all got our favorites. Ah, many of them are here at this conference and maybe that's what brought you here to the OC, you know, to Orange County to, ah, you know, kind of to meet your master and to see this person. But how do you know who is really a master therapist? How do you figure that out? You know, some write beautifully, uhm, all we do is, you know, you, you can read their books and their articles to tell you they are. Irvin Yalom is one of my favorites and Jeffrey Kottler and Mary Pipher who, who just left here a moment ago and Harriet Lerner, ah, and other people are just master speakers. They've had this great, ah, slide shows and music and photos and, ah, they really entertain us very well. Ah, we learn some valuable skills and maybe some helpful information but are they really master therapists? What have I actually do in therapy? How do we know who's really good? Now, some of you can watch them, you know, you, you, you've probably all seen, ah, you know, some of the videos of them but most of therapy takes place behind closed doors and it's private. It's secret. So, how do we really know? The people on films usually are doing some incredible session and we assume that this is how it is every time they go out and they go on to the consultation room. I can honestly tell you that after making 300 videos with the best therapists of our time, that's not true. I can assure you that. Nobody bats a thousand, you know, not Adler, Young, or Froid. The truth is more like my son's basketball coach who we refer to as Mr. Motivation after my son made a long basket, a long shot and he said, "Even a blind squirrel gets a nut once in a while," you know, and, you know, he somehow think that that's the way it is for a lot of us who, who make a video. We don't have a lot of research on mastery, Malcolm Gladwell who's some of you have heard of, he wrote this book called Outliers and he keynoted the American Psychological Association a couple of years ago. Ah, he said it takes 10,000 hours, have you ever heard that figure? So, if you're gonna be a master at anything but we-- we're talking about therapy here, you've gotta have 10,000 hours, ah, but, you know, most of us know that this is kind of a myth. Ah, it's, it's a myth because as Dan Goleman has a new book, ah, out that's called Focus, ah, he says that this is only half true. He says if you're a duffer at golf, say, and you make the same mistake every time you take a swing or you putt and you do that for 10,000 hours of practicing, that error will not improve your game. You'll still be a duffer. You won't be a master. You'll be a lot older but, ah, you know, you'll still be a duffer. There's another man named Anders Ericsson and maybe you've, you've heard of this gentleman. He's at, ah, Florida State University. He's a cognitive scientist then. He was one of the first to talk about this 10,000-hour rule. His research found that the top violinists, that's what he studied, ah, in the best music academies in the world practice their instruments for 10,000 hours and while those had done 75,000 hours-- 7500 hours, ah, were what he referred to, his joke not mine, as second fiddle. So it seems, ah, that-- to believe that you don't get the benefit from mechanical repetition alone. But you really have to adjust your execution as you get closer to the goal. This requires good supervision and ability to take feedback. Think of that, an ability to take feedback. Sometimes that's hard for people who have strong egos. Scott Miller and Barry Duncan in their work have highlighted this in a paper that they call Supershrinks and they talk about that if you wanna be a supershrink that you need to be able to take feedback and you have to be willing to practice. Now, this Anders Ericsson believe that almost anybody, this is a good news at this program so you can all breathe then, ah, can achieve excellence or mastery with smart practice. He calls this deliberate practice. I don't know if you've ever heard that term. Ah, this includes a feedback, a little, that let's you recognize errors and to correct them. This is a type of concentrated practice that we see when therapists work with their supervisors. You can't daydream and you really can't become defensive. When practice occurs while we're focusing elsewhere, the brain doesn't rewire the relevant circuity(ph). Mindfulness meditation can help you. So, if you really wanna be, ah, ah, master therapist, consider meditation because that'll help you improve concentration and to help create the full attention that's necessary to defeat daydreaming. And those people at the top, they never stop practicing. They do a lot of time for rest although it might not seem like it and, ah, you know, rest will restore their physical, you know, and their emotional energy. So, when I look at my own professional career to figure out how I got here, right and I wanna explain some things. It was kind of narcissistic to even get up and say "master therapist", you know, and give a talk at, at the Master Therapy Conference but, you know, I'm gonna have a go at it. Ah, I completed my first doctorate in 1971, that was a long time ago, ah, as-- and I was a counseling psychologist with that doctorate and I began my practice of psychotherapy. But I also began my post-doctoral study at that same time at what was the Alfred Adler Institute in Chicago. Ah, yes, Adler Institute and-- ah, now this is the Adler School of Professional Psychology. As I practice psychology, I continue to study it. In 1973 I went, went through transcendental meditation like so many of the rest of you or some of you did. Ah, and I begin studying eastern religion. I even moved to Hawaii in 1975 where I was able to study other eastern approaches. I returned to Wisconsin and I started to, ah, continued my psychotherapy practice and I would see 80 or 90 clients per week. And I did this for several years, of course, I have five children and, you know, I guess we do things like that when you're the sole provider. I returned at that time to the Adler School of Professional Psychology and I received my psychotherapy certificate which is the same thing as it's like in Adler and I turned to be an analyst and then I also had a Psy.D. in, ah, clinical psychology all the while being supervised by Len Sperry who's here today including part of my internship at the Medical College of Wisconsin with psychiatric residence. Over the next more than two decades, I practiced in many clients. I taught therapy at the Adler School and at where I'm at now, Governors State University. I continued study in psychotherapy. Ah, I continued doing that by making films. I've made over, you know, for 20 years, I've made over 300 films with the best therapists of our times. I've watched them, make three-- work with three or four clients, some for six sessions with the same clients and I've critiqued them. Ah, i-- it was just a fascinating experience. I also begin writing on psychotherapy, on the psychotherapy process with Jeffrey Kottler who is a professor here at, you know, as I mentioned before. And he and I have done a dozen books. Maybe you've read some of them. They're, you know, like the Mummy At The Dining Room Table and Bad Therapy and what we did as we study there are all of these aspects of therapy like deception, loneliness, relationships, creativity, one that's called the, ah, unsocial justice. It's helping beyond The Fifteen Minute Hour. You know, do you walk the talk? I mean, what do you do when you're done practicing therapy? Are you a helper or do you go home and whatever you do, you know. I think two helpers are always giving and they're helping almost 24/7. We wrote on reciprocal changes, you know, how are clients changed us, professional identity. We even did indigenous healing. We went and studied some of the practices that shamans do. We studied self-supervision, conflict resolution. All of these are different books on, ah, difficult cases. And as part of our research, what we did is we collected stories from the leading therapists of our times and the wisdom of these therapists. None of my actions were pre-determined. Ah, it was, you know, ah, maybe I'm just a workaholic it hurt, ah, how was I able to master, you know, these psychotherapeutic skills. I have thousands. Ah, we calculated it, 60,000 hours-- of client hours that I've seen. Uhm, I had a regular opportunity to observe and to model the very best therapist of our times and if you don't watch films of people, I, I think you're really missing out a lot. And I'm not trying to promote my films but, but you're gonna get other people's phones. I don't care but watch therapy take place. Ah, so I've analyzed this master therapist working with real clients. I've had this excellent supervision, I've gotten feedback all the while increasing my own concentration with four decades of meditation. Now, this thing that I'm talking about, this mastery that I have supposedly achieved is clearly the result of effort and clearly the result of, of process and it's not genetics, it's not privilege. It's like putting your time in, in the saddle. Now, a few years ago, I was invited to give a talk and I know this is a tad narcissistic but, ah, I wanna come back to talking about how this fits in to mastery and, ah, the Adler School invited me to give a talk and they-- it was for their first Alumni Award, you know, this distinguished alumni and I didn't know it at that time but, ah, the-- the-- they wanted me to talk about a lifetime of learning. They wanted me to take about curiosity. See, I don't know if you have curiosity. I think curiosity is gone today. I think we have a whole generation of therapists that are just mechanics. All they want is CEUs, ah, the-- they wanna get their license then they wanna go get behind the closed door and if they weren't required to go and get CEUs, they were done learning. You know, and so for me it was after my formal education that I think I really began to learn and I see several of you are nodding your heads too. Ah, I've always been curious and I've done so many things. I'm just gonna mention some of, you know, I started out with a background that's probably different than a lot of yours. Ah, I was a school teacher, I was an elementary school teacher, ah, all right. I'll tell the truth. If you're in elementary school education in college you would always have a date if you were a man. I never, I never had a problem with that. I went on from that to do elementary school counseling and I was really excited about because, you know, it's, it's from, ah, the, the, the, you know, acorns that oak trees developed and, ah, a friend of mine did a study and I don't know why people haven't picked up on this but if you, if you study the self-concept of children when they begin school, they like themselves and by second grade, they don't like themselves. Wow! Okay. No, we don't-- you know, it, it doesn't sound very good. So, I thought I could intervene as a school counselor, that was very interesting to me then I moved on to training counselors, I thought that would be better. Then I got really interested in competency based learning, how to create individualized learning models, kind of Carl Rogers talked about in his book call The Freedom to Learn. That may even took distended community government. I was curious so, you know, I'd let people walk to me and I sat on a city council. I always thought I need to write books so I started writing books. I've written 60 of them, I got involved with health and wellness, ah, you know, health and wellness is, is something that I always thought. I've read a study that said if we're not healthier than our clients, our clients get, you know, worse. But I didn't realized if we find real healthy clients, we can get better, you know, if we work with them. But, anyway, I get really interested in health and wellness and, ah, and I realized I didn't know anything about it. I don't think you do either. Maybe you do but it's one of these things that we study about sickness, don't we? We don't study about health. Ah, then I got interested in sports psychology and I wrote book call The Centered Athlete and then I became, ah, ah, an athlete myself and, ah, got third place in the U.S. in Cross Country one year in my 30s. Ah, you know, I, I was going around and I was very much interested in reaching my potential and let me became a university coach. Ah, I coach cross country for four or five years just trying to optimize potential. Then I got involved with education and, and, you know, Adler talk about people need training not treatment and I got involve with developing a program called DUSO, you know, it's called Developing Understanding Self and Others but it trains elementary school kids on how to have a better self-concept. Then I did one for parenting. I helped with book-- program called STEP, Systematic Training for Effective Parenting which, which is taught to over 4 million people how to be better parents and then I did a program called TIME for couples called Training In Marriage Enrichment and then we did one called PREP which was for high school kids how to be better partners and better parents and, you know, I was excited about that and then Adlerian Psychology came along and I edited the journal of that for 17 years and then clinical psychology with a new doctor's degree. I was excited about that. And then cycle of therapy and, ah, and, sex therapy and even hypnosis and I have all those different certificates. I get so excited with all of it and then couple and family therapy. I founded the family journal which has won all sorts of awards. It's been in business now. I did it for 13 years, it's been a journal for 20 years then I got in professional organization leadership. I was the president of the International Association of Marriage and Family Counselor. I, you know, I'm just curious and then I look it was a medium. Ah, you know, I've done all the talk shows, at Today Show, Good Morning America and, you know, these different programs, ah, all looking for different ways to have influence on people. I was the relationship expert in WGN Chicago for several years. There's a lot of power in modeling and giving good information. Then I did a syndicated cartoons, so syndicated it's called on the edge and we took cartoons to answer problems. You know, it's, it's like, ah, there's a guy in jail and, ah, he's sitting there talking to a cellmate, he's seen 17 arrests, 17 convictions maybe it is me, yeah, and I pass that out to my clients. You know, if it walks like a duck, talks a duck, looks like a duck, maybe it's a duck. Put duck in response but, you know, so there's so many cartoons that we could use and, and then, ah, international psychology. I've done a lot of work abroad and then Buddhism and meditation and my latest is on chronic illness and ageing. I've spent the last two years really sick. I've had, ah, cancer that I was not suppose to survive and quadruple bypass and transplants and four surgeries and, yeah, lots of exciting things, you know, that I didn't know anything about cuz I've, you know, even the day before I have quadruple bypass I exercise for an hour for figure. Ah, so I'm gonna rested and, and any of you, ah, would like to help me with this, give me your cards, your email, or contact Donna(ph) and get some questions on any therapists that are older than 55. Because the average age of therapist is 53 and I think older therapists are different than younger therapists. I think older clients are different than younger therapists but we don't know much about it in the literature. We don't talk much about it in the literatures. So, you know, I welcome anyone's help. So let's review, you know, I told you what I did and now we're gonna look at what experts say. There's a book call Mastery by a man name Robert Greene that come out last year. And, and this book really talks about the mastery process and, and how across the board people get to be masters and let's look at these things I've narcissized about myself make any sense in terms of this, you know, this-- my progression makes any sense in terms of how one gets to be a master therapist. The first thing he talks about and, and this may be the most important one and I think many of you here unlike other conferences a-- are gonna get one in talking about. It's you have to dis-- you have to discover your calling. You have to discover your vocation. You know, some people call it your life task, what you were meant to accomplish in the time you're here. I-- i-- i-- it's this intense connection, this intense desire that allows you to withstand the pain of the process. So I just went through all of those things and I can tell you it wasn't a lot of fun doing all that stuff at times. It was drudgery, it was painful, it was boring, it was-- well, we'll get to that in a minute. You know, you have to withstand the pain of the process, there's self-doubts, there's tedious hours that you put in, there's practice, there's study, there's giving up pleasures that you have, it's, you know, disappointing family, you know. , I've got five children, too, by the way, then married to one person for, you know,-- when, when I was in Good Morning America and I gave the names of my children and they wanna know how many wives I have had, ah, I guess people aren't married for four to five or six years anymore. Ah, but, you know, the, the-- this whole idea, ah, if you don't have this commitment, ah, it, it-- the set ups are gonna stop you, you're gonna quit. There's old-- you know, there's endless barbs from people. To master develops resiliency and confidence though from this process that other people lack. It, it's a journey, you know, with a lot of twists and turns rather than a straight line, you know. O-- one of my favorite saying is the-- these days, if it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger, and I think we kinda have to look at that. Ah, so this question I have to ask you is who are you. You know, what's your life purpose and if you're wondering, you know, think about what is something that always excited you. See, I have lots of excitements. I, you know, I master something and I move on and I find something else and master it and move on and but what's something that really excites you, jump in with both feet? In order to master a field, you must love that subject and feel a profound connection to it. Your interest must transcend the feel and really border on the religious. Think of this, Einstein's fascination. You know, he was, he was, he was fascinated with all the stuff we can't see, you know, this invisible forces that govern the universe and Ingmar Bergman, ah, that director, he wanted to create inanimate life and John Coltrane wanted to give a voice to emotion and Sal Minuchin and Virginia Satir wanted to help us understand how families change or influence their lives. And Irv Yalom and the beauty of life and Carl Rogers, you know, he wanted us to learn that he's passion was helping to solve, find their own best way. Wow! You know, even Fred Rogers wanted us, you know, to be a better neighbor. You know, Albert Ellis and Tim Beck, ah, the, the power of cognitions, ah, you know, how these thoughts will either grow or retard our lives. What are those small things that you're good at? You know, think about that yourself. What are those passions? You know, for me, I struggled with this and so I, I don't expect you to raise your hand and say it's this because it's almost like trying to read something that's this close to you, you can't. But you ought to be able to see it, it's right in front of you and, and for me it was obvious but it took me forever. I love people, you know, ah, I, I still hang out with the kids I went to grade school even though they, you know, they're all over the country, all over the world. Ah, ah, ah, ah, I had many friends. Ah, you know, I, I knew just about everybody in our high school, at a huge suburban Chicago High School, ah, with 2000 people in my graduating class and I love listening to their stories. Ah, I can still remember the stories of my clients. I take notes but I never use them. You know, I live in a small town and I run in to people and they say, "You don't remember me," and I can just start reciting all sorts of facts and, you know, they just, "Where does that come from?" I don't know where it comes from, you know, other than it's just a, you know, just a passion and, ah, and, and you probably have something quite similar. Ah, you know, I think, ah, I got along with everybody. I don't know if you did but, you know, I hope you did. Ah, parents, I like my parents, I'm one of those weird people and my children like me too and, ah, and their friends say, "You like your dad?" You know, anyway, we won't go there. Ah, you know, ah, ah, I like my, my siblings, I like my friends, I like girlfriends and teachers and neighbors and bosses and, you know, the late Bill Blizzard told me that when you get along with all the significant people in your life, you're mentally healthy. Think about that. Now that's really an important definition for us because it's a relational definition and that's something that we, therapist, know about, about relationships. We might not know, know much about chemistry but, boy, we know a lot about relationships. So a clue to figuring your passion out, it's, it's kind of the, the simple law of human psychology I guess, ah, that your thoughts are gonna tend to revolve around what you value the most. I can see by some of you, you won't need to be a sex therapist but, but there's probably some other thoughts that you could have to, you know, that, that, that are there. What do you think about? What's important to you? Those are the things. Now, the second thing is to submit to reality. What does that mean? Your apprenticeship, you know, your apprenticeship and how long should your apprenticeship last or your, your internship? I don't know. Probably forever but we, we can talk about that in a minute. It used to be that you were in an apprenticeship if you're gonna be a barrel-maker or if you were gonna learn how to do it, you know, ah, ah, some kind of a trade and you know how long those apprenticeships were? They were seven years. You know what seven years? That's 10,000 hours. Oh, wow, where did that come from? Because 10,000 hours actually change your brain, that's what researchers tell us. Remember, the time though that leads to mastery is dependent upon our focus, just how focus are we. The goal of an internship is transformation, it's transformation of your mind and transformation of your character. You transform yourself from someone who is impatient and somebody who stuttered to somebody who is disciplined and focused with a mind that can handle complexity. Now, how do you this? Well, the first part is, is kind of a passive way. You know, you observe when you acquire knowledge and information. You have to study. You know, the second part is you start to acquire skills and practice and, you know, that's kind of the practice component. And the third component is, is, is really the active component. We start to experiment. You try to put all the stuff together, you know, you, you try to find your own style. What's an ideal internship? Well, to, to start with this one you, you value learning over money. You know, I have so many people pick their internships to who they wanna learn from based upon convenience or money. Listen to your own voice. Ah, resist conforming to social norms. You know, faux pas are the once that chase money, that chase fame, they chase attention, they chase-- all these are the wrong reasons. Try to keep expanding your horizons, you know, too many people don't try to do too much in life. They believe by limiting their circle of action in their choices, they kind of develop this illusion of control. Ah, the less we attempt, the less chances there are to fail, that's kind of their philosophy. When I was at Southern Illinois University, I'm kind of a public school kid that I went to Southern Illinois University and Buckminster Fuller was there is, one of this-- the brightest guys of our time. He did these geodesic domes you would see him. He's a guy who didn't talk for a year and then he wrote a book that was sentence long, 174 pages but different manner and, and Buckminster Fuller says, "More people suffer from sameness than from nonconformity. Well, I think that's beautiful. You know, more people suffer from sameness than from nonconformity. You need to enter the career-- your career as an outsider, ah, refer to a feeling of inferiority and this thing that-- at the East we call it, ah, beginner's mind, that's where you're open and aware and ready to take in all the learning that's available. Remind us empty, open that's hungry to learn just like the first day you got here to Orange County, you noticed everything and now you're in a routine, you just walked down the hall, go to Starbuck, you know, you just-- but at first, that first day you had that beginner's mind, try to maintain that. Try to jettison your smugness and, and realize that, you know, there's others know more than you do. You know, trust this process, ah, although it might have a tremendous amount of drudgery. You think of drudgery, you know, we would say, "Oh, he gets tired." Darwin, did you know Darwin studied barnacles for eight years so he could get his certification as a biologist, you know, so he could get his credential? All you gotta do is a lousy couple of thousand hours and so many people complain about that, about their supervised hours, ah, just think of those barnacles, I guess. Move towards resistance, ah, you know, this and, and pain. Don't choose the easy and comfortable. You know, if it's resistant it's kinda like you, you're opening your blinders to take in things that don't fit who you are. In, in athletics we used to call it the PTAs of stuff and that was the pain, torture, excuse me, pain, torture, and agony stages. Ah, you'll encounter many difficult, many tedious experiences in your career and it's here that you cultivate the ability, you know, to really to handle challenges with discipline. Again, it's this what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. This process hardwires the learning and as long as you're not distracted, again, remember that ability to focus, ah, that's-- can come from meditation and other things but especially meditation that can help you with so many things. And stay away with-- from today's technological, ah, distractions. You know, like the email you're answering right now as I'm talking, ah, you know. You, you, you, you really gonna learn how to handle the complexities and be a master and guess what, you're gonna be overwhelm by that. We've created this world that's not particularly healthy. We never would started with this, you know, we don't talk as much to people, we've withdrawn, we burrow the loneliness and that what we learn in someone's book. We have back decks not front porches, you know, we don't-- you know, there are so many ways that we're withdrawing cuz we're lonelier then I'll get out. But once you take this far enough with this training that you enter a cycle of, ah, accelerated returns and this is the front part. I mean, the practice becomes easier, you know, and it becomes more interesting and it becomes more enjoyable and you, you, you do it for longer hours and this increases your skill levels and just, just kinda feeds on itself and, ah, you know, you start to have a lot of fun. You know, I think we don't need to apprentice ourselves in failure though, ah, mistakes and failures, ah, are precisely your means of an education. You've gotta advance to trial and error. You know, Jeffrey Kottler and I, one of our favorite books is Bad Therapy and we asked psychotherapists, you know, what's the worst thing you did? And there are some dozy stories on that book. If-- I mean, they're a lot of fun to read. I was surprised that-- but, but everyone says we all do bad therapy, don't we? We just hopefully don't do the same mistake day after day after day, you know, and hopefully we learn from our mistakes. Ah, remember, it's things like your emotional intelligence and your levels of desire and, and your patience and your persistence and your confidence. That's what ends a plan, a much larger role in success than our intelligence or our brains. You know, once I heard that, you know, once I heard that the P in PhD stood for persistence I knew I could be a Ph-- you know, I could do it. You know, it's persistence, it's the ability to follow through. The third thing is to choose and benefit from your mentor. Find a mentor, plan to surpass your mas-- your, your master-- your master's mastery. You know, it was Nietzsche who said, "One repays a teacher badly if one remains only a pupil." Ah, repay your teachers by outshining them. Mentors are important though because they're gonna give you honest feedback and they're gonna give you helpful feedback. People in general are increasingly reluctant to tell each other the truth about themselves, their weaknesses, their inadequacies, their flaws in their work. I remember a man Dan Fullner(ph) when I work in Hawaii. He said, "You don't know, shit," that was his words and, you know, all the people in the group rallied around me and they said, "Well, don't listen to him. He's old com-- he doesn't know a crap." But I did. He was right. I didn't know about what I was doing and that what's sent me back to school, you know, to learn this and keep learning and learning until I felt that I actually knew something. Uhm, and you've gotta find somebody who's gonna be honest with you, they're gonna help us with our weaknesses, our inadequace-- ah, inadequacies, our flaws. To be a master you're gonna have to be willing to experience and profit from the endless criticisms of our work. Fourth is learn to see people as they are. Develop social intelligence, you know, ah, deal with the resistance and manipulation of people around us, it's as bigger challenge as mastery. Don't give in to those feelings of boredom or impatience or fear or confusion because once you do, this whole process stops, doesn't it? Yeah. It, it just stops. Learn to read people. If you're not sure, get their emotions up a little bit, shake them up a little bit, and they'll reveal a lot and you'll figure out what's going on. Be aware of this seven deadly realities that people e-- envy and, you know, that's gonna force you to lose track of what's important. Buddhist talk about this as the attachment, ah, conformism. This is the pressure from your group plus your profession is a bit like everyone else and think of the people that you've come here, that you admire, they're the people who thought differently. Rigidity, you know, that keeps people stuck. Self-obsessiveness and that just doesn't work in this profession more over supposed to be other focus. Laziness, now that's another one. Hard work is gonna breed endurance. Flagging, I said, we're back to focus again, in meditation, and passive aggression. Just don't waste your time on sideshows. Let them go, you know, you've gotta acquire some social intelligence. Just speak through your work period, you know, just let your action stand. You know, something that you feel good about and if you don't feel good about it, then do something about it. You just crap this appropriate persona, be this person that you admire, you know. You know how I got into writ-- writing and writing and I read this book the Love Story, I must have been thinking about sex then and Erich Segal, I admire him because he ran marathons and wrote books. So I started marathons and writing books and, I don't know, I, I told the kids and my wife it's a love story but, ah, anyway, it's a different thing. Try to see other people as they see you, ah, and we all have flaws. Some are harmless, don't worry about it too much and others are gonna us in trouble. Finally, awaken your creativity. That's, ah, you know, this final stage of mastery and, ah, you-- as, as you learn all the skills that govern you, you become more active and you seek ways to use these skills that are more so suited your strengths and purposes and sort of just feeling complacent with what you know. You know, it's an old Dr. Seuss' story that I just love and it was call On Beyond Zebra, remember that one? On Beyond Zebra, it's high time you know that when we-- it goes beyond the alphabet. He creates his own letters and, you now, we need to be willing to go on beyond zebra in which did a thing when I was the editor of the Adlerian Journal, a movement that was called On Beyond the Adler without, you know, we're getting too incestuous but maybe you can, you can do your own On Beyond whatever. Ah, you know, we need to expand your knowledge into related field, ah, you make associations in between different ideas. We know that if there's better things that have been developed that are really different, really unique, and really helpful, they come from this process that E.O. Wilson calls consilience and consilience is kinda like looking at a problem from a lot of different angles, you know, like an anthropologist and family therapist and a psychiatrist and, and we try to look at a problem and come up with a, a different way of seeing things. A different way, a different formula, and this might be against the rules that have-- you've internalized and you just kinda have to shape them and you're gonna have to reform them. And, you know, it, it, it's kinda like i-- it's gonna disconnect you, maybe, from the professional world you know. Ah, you know, there's a famous saying, I think it's by somebody named the Earl of Derby, how do you like that? I don't know why I remember that but he said a skillful mariner has to be willing to lose sight of the shore and you're gonna have to do that. You're gonna have to be willing to be uncomfortable. This, this creative task, you must have patience and the faith. Now, what you're doing is gonna yield something that's worthwhile, something that's important, ah, you must be connected in something deep within you. It needs to be realistic and you've gotta let go of comfort, you've gotta let go of security. Uhm, develop some creative strategies, get rid of this conformation bias where we look at people. You know, we know in our profession, they train us only how to see what's wrong and yet we read the research and it says, "People only grow when we see what's right." Wow! Figure that one. Wasn't that odd? You know, we supposed to see everybody and their problems and yet it's only when we see their strengths and their assets and what they bring to the table that they can truly grow. But let me see what we have here and see, we've got a little bit of time left up. Ah, mastery is not question of genetics and it's not a question of luck but, ah, of following your natural inclinations and your deep desire that stirs up within you and everybody's got these inclinations. That desire within you is not motivated by egotism or sheer ambition for power but, ah, these emotions actually get in the way of mastery. So, what I did then is I went-- I wanna go just one step further, is to verify whether this stuff I've just told you about, I've told you me and I've told you what the mastery acts or said. So I went and I interviewed some of the people that are here and some of the people that I consider master and I asked them some question, you know, and here's some of the answers. Like what's the most important thing in being a, being a master therapist? Well, Diana Fosha, I don't know if you know Diana, but she founded an approach to therapy called, ah, AEDP, it's, ah, accelerated experiential dynamic psychotherapy. It's not like EFT, uhm, it f-- you know, she says that it's having passion for our work. We like the challenge. It's, it's almost a need to understand, to figure out how this whole mysterious thing of using ourselves to change other people and how that works. Laura Brown who founded feminist therapy, ah, one of the founders, she, she says she feels this conveying compassion to people and to be pretty geniuinely present to witness somebody else's pain. Melba Vasquez who's the most recent president of the APA finds it tune in and being present in accounting about the client's pain, their situation, their dilemma. Michele Weiner-Davis who's on the faculty here says the stability to challenge somebody without criticizing them. Michael Hoyt who's here of, you know, on brief therapy feels as being kind, being interested in conveying hope that somebody could actually be helped. Michael Yapko who's one of, ah, my good friends here at the conference, he says the bottom line is to help people efficiently and effectively. And Kirk Schneider who's, ah, existential-humanist therapist, he says, ah, you need to have gone through your own therapy and it should be pretty deep in order to truly help others. Brad Keeney who's, ah, some of you know Brad, ah, Brad's kind of-- we call them the American Shaman in one of our books. He says, "You gotta tap in the life's vital force, musicians call it soul. Once you can enter into their spirit, you'll understand their motivations, you'll foresee their actions, and you will recognize how the best be of help. You know, and he said, he said if you don't understand what he said then you don't got it. Ah, a family therapist name Scott Brown he says, he says it's being curious perpetually. Nancy McWilliams, a psychoanalyst, says you gotta have genuine interest in people. Judith Jordan who founded relational-cultural therapy believes that stability to connect with others in order to help them rework their neu-- neural pathways. Roger Walsh who's a psychiatrist and transpersonal therapist next to U.C. Irvine, ah, he thinks he's going through personal transform to therapy yourself and meditating a lot. Ah, Bob Wubbolding, ah, who's a longtime reality therapist, he, he says you gotta hang out with a lot wide variety of people from different backgrounds and cultures and develop consilience in order to develop the change and others have said that master therapist own their own errors. They never fall to blame their client and not worried about making mistakes. Rather they're intrigued by them. Ah, they enjoy the challenging cases or situations, they see other people's strengths and resources more readily than their weaknesses. As Michael Yapko says ,"Therapy is about expanding wellness not shrinking pathology." Barry Duncan who's a leading psychotherapy researcher, ah, he, he says, "It's-- you gotta assess the ability where your client is so you can correct the treatment once the client stops growing." He also tells a cautionary story which I'm gonna read to you quickly. He said there's two apprentice monks and, ah, they're discussing their respective masters like I hear some of you doing out here in the halls of Evolution Conference and, you know, w-- while these people are cleaning their, ah, their temple. And the first novice proudly tells his companion about the many miracles he's seen his famous master perform and I've watched the young novice said, "Yes, my master turned the entire village into Buddhist. He's made rain fall from the sky and he's moved in utmost so that he could pass." And the other novice listen attentively and then he demonstrates a much deeper understanding by responding, "My master also does many miraculous things. When he's hungry, he eats. When he's thirsty, he drinks. And when he's tired, he sleeps." Hi-- his point is that the first monk-- and many have the account just, you know, like the first monk that's enamored by miracles scouted by masters and thousands of clients and research about change, however, have taught Barry in this case to discard the claims of poor and snakeoil salesman and instead to honor these more enduring acts that we all know about things like love and, ah, believing in clients and the power of partnership and ability to show up fully. These simple magical acts are like the eating, drinking, and sleeping of therapy. Some said master therapists learn throughout their lifetime, they work from intuition that they can tell you later what to do. You must be willing to be stupid, somebody said and several said, "You can't get here by trying to get here." Somebody said, "You, ah, you gotta embrace the struggle." The comments that I, I drew from people and I, I, I have more of this, ah, just really verify that, ah, these ideas are the kinds of things we need to grow. Jeffrey Kat-- Kottler in our book said, you know, you, you, you've gotta have deep compassion and caring. You've gotta have this sophisticated inter-- interpersonal skills like you've gotta be look-- really listen, you know, like listening with a third ear. You gotta know what probably maybe mostly makes a difference. You gotta speak the truth, be honest with yourself and with others. You, you gotta seek out constructive feedback, be curious, model others, and remember that love is a four-letter word. Ah, you know, those are some of the things that we hear. Let me just kinda be in conclusion and maybe we'll have time for a couple of questions. It's not a product of privilege, mastery. It's, it's not an inborn talent. Ah, it's just not even the right alignment of the stars, it's not elusive, it's not magic (inaudible ). It's achievable with hard work though and good feedback, good supervision, good coaching, whatever you wanna call it. And it's so important to do this hard work to create the base for future development. As Goethe says, "Everyone holds his fortune in his own hands, like sculpture the raw of fashion into a figure. But it's the same with this type of artistic creativity as it is with all others but merely born with the capability to do it. The skill to mold the material into what we want must be learned and attentively cultivated." You know, so I urge all of you, you know, to really to stay on and get keep on the path. So, we have some microphones here. If, if anyone has questions and, you know, the final, you know, we have, ah, 10 minutes I think, don't we? We have 10 minutes, about 10 minutes. Ah, at eight minutes we'll be glad to entertain them, so thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

The Evolution of Psychotherapy Welcome! The 7th Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference The World's Largest Psychotherapy Conference Anaheim, California â€¢ 2013 

00:53:15
 Over here? 

00:53:20
JON CARLSON Yes. 

00:53:20
 My father was a psychoanalyst and he never talk sharp. 

00:53:25
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:53:25
 At the end of his career, I once asked him, ah, "What kind of analyst are you? Ah, Freudian? A Jungian? An existential?" And he looked at me and he said, "After 40,000 cases, those labels don't mean anything." Now, considering the incredibly - 

00:53:40
JON CARLSON That's wonderful. 

00:53:40
 - various kinds of things you have done, would-- can you relate to that? Ah, ah, is your therapy sort of beyond labels? Beyond styles? 

00:53:50
JON CARLSON Uh-hmm. Sure. I think so. And, and I, I think everybody is cuz you have to find something that fits you. Ah, youk now, I've often said that, you know, if Adler were alive, he wouldn't be an Adlerian, you know, and, you know, and, and I think we all develop our own styles for the time and the era, you know, in which we were but we should have some principles that we follow and that hopefully we write those ourselves. If it-- yeah. 

00:54:15
 I'm wondering, ah, how many hours of sleep do you average per night? 

00:54:25
JON CARLSON You know, not many for a long time. 

00:54:25
 I suppose cuz I'm figuring... 

00:54:25
JON CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, to have a lot of energy. 

00:54:25
 Also I'm wondering if you've had a lot of experience, oh-- I'm wondering if you'd an experience with mediocre supervision and how you coped with that. 

00:54:35
JON CARLSON Ah, well, you'll stop it for one thing, you know, I would stop it. If, if your supervision isn't helping you to grow then find somebody else and don't hesitate to say this isn't working for me and to find somebody else and, ah, and there's, there's an awful lot of mediocre supervisors out there and, ah, they don't know it but they're out there. Hmm. Yeah. 

00:55:00
 Thank you. 

00:55:00
JON CARLSON Sure. Yeah. 

00:55:00
 I just had a comment, ah, I really appreciate your talk in this kind goes to any, ah, students in the room - 

00:55:05
JON CARLSON Thanks. 

00:55:05
 - or, ah, starting therapist. Ah, there is a moment in, ah, early in my career about six months after-- ah, I, I graduate, I've a Master's Degree and I've been practicing for about six months, - 

00:55:15
JON CARLSON Uh-hmm. 

00:55:15
 - uhm, and I got out of group, ah, session, ah, that I've led and I went to my office and shut the door and I just sat there and I said out loud, "I don't know what the hell I am doing." And, and that was, you know, -- 

00:55:35
JON CARLSON Come to Jesus at that moment. 

00:55:35
 Yeah. And that-- and, and, and I actually know when it occurred i-- it was in, uhm, April of 2006 - 

00:55:40
JON CARLSON Wow. 

00:55:40
 - and at that moment, up until this day, uhm, I study weekly. There, there hasn't been a week that goes by without having read or studied and I've actually kept track of every article, every book, every-- everything that I read, a little OCD, uhm, - 

00:55:55
JON CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's okay. 

00:55:55
 - since, uhm, since April of, of 2007 and I cannot say, ah, just how helpful that has been. And I think when you come to that realization and I don't want to probably be called a therapist. I'd like to say I'm becoming a therapist and I think I'll continue to say that, you know, 30 years from now, 40-- I'm becoming a therapist. 

00:56:15
JON CARLSON That's very nice. 

00:56:15
 And I really appreciate your talk. It's just for any of the grad students in the room or beginning therapist. Uhm, yeah, I think that's kind of a good thing to kind of take hard as, ah,-- to continue to work, continue to study and, ah, become a therapist. Thank you. 

00:56:30
JON CARLSON Wonderful. Thank you. Very, very nice, thank you. That's very, very nice. Yeah. Okay, way over here and then we'll come back. 

00:56:35
 You had mentioned briefly your work in sex therapy and actually the intimate couple is one of my favorite and I-- yeah, enjoy really great. And so I wanted you to see, ah, your foray in that area and your new learning that you're talking about. What were the particular things that aided you in that exploration? 

00:57:00
JON CARLSON Hmm. In my most recent near death experience kind of a thing? I think I have some-- my friend Jerry Corey(ph) there in the front row who was right in front of you praying for me everyday and other people. You know, I think it comes from the power of friendship and, ah,-- really helpful for me cuz I, I'm like the-- what was that book Mitch Albom wrote about Tuesdays with Morrie. You know, he, he got to have this, ah, funeral before he died but I had an outpouring of people around the world and, ah, you know, that was so meaningful to me. People I didn't hardly knew who just reach out and, ah, and I got-- I go to Thailand and I would be at, ah, YouTubes every week from people in Thailand just telling me how much they love me and I didn't know those people but they came every week on, you know, on time. The-- it's, it's love. It's caring, it's that compassion that other people share for you that filled me. You know, that's so powerful. We don't talk a lot about that, ah, but we need to talk more about that. We talk more about boundaries, you know, rather than, rather than-- yeah. That's a quick answer. 

00:58:10
 Thank you. 

00:58:10
JON CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:58:10
 Hello. Uhm, how do you approach a mentor? I've tr-- I've tried to-- I mean, I have many mentors who were like my heroes but, I mean, how do you convince someone to become your mentor? How do you-- it's like you can't convince someone to be your friend, right? 

00:58:30
JON CARLSON Ah, you know... 

00:58:30
 So, how do you approach a mentor? 

00:58:30
JON CARLSON You know, there's, there's great stories that you can find from people about how they became a mentor we'll handle and then he'll tell you a wonderful one. 

00:58:40
 Ah, I, I wrote to him. 

00:58:45
JON CARLSON Yeah. Did he tell you he was-- well, you know, he was, he was an ordinary, since what, gardener. He mold this lawn so he could get close to him and, ah, my friend Brad Keeney went and sat in, ah, Gregory Basin's front yard everyday until finally he got invited in. You know, I, I, I think it's, you know, some of that kind of creativity, you know, that you find somebody that you really want to learn from, I've really wanted to learn Buddhism. You know, I, I went to the Tibet, met the Dalai Lama, went to his house, I've been there a couple of times, held his hand for 45 minutes and talk about things that were just amazing. How do you that? Persistence, connection. I, you know, I don't know how we do things like that. Yeah. You know, but, ah, don't give up. There's a lot of people to learn from. So - 

00:59:35
 Thank you. 

00:59:35
JON CARLSON - we have, ah, one more and then we're gonna stop. Thank you. 

00:59:40
 Yes. As you were speaking today I just became aware of, ah, a tension that I've often struggled with of, of on one hand, ah, needing to focus and-- on things and yet at the other si-- on the other side, uhm, just following the joy having that child-like delight in, you know, what's before you and I just wonder if you could just comment on that. 

01:00:05
JON CARLSON Ah, yeah, I'm not sure that I follow it though. You know, it's, it's-- help me understand it again. It's this, this tension, this tension that you feel... 

01:00:15
 Well-- yeah, between needing to focus, discipline, uhm, really master, ah, - 

01:00:20
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:00:20
 - certain things and also maybe the aspect of just, you know, being able to pursue and, ah, follow the joy, kind of just pursuing the joy of what you're doing and which might leave you EBD. 

01:00:40
JON CARLSON Yeah. You know, again, that's, that's really a big question, ah, it-- that all I might think is to sit some more, you know, to sit some more with it is what a Buddhist might tell you and, and just focus more in being in the present sitting with yourself and just seeing what comes out. Ah, I mean, there's lots of books out on happiness, ah, ah, ah, that, that, that the fundamental mus-- message of most of them is start giving out to people and it's through helping others that you're really going to, ah, gonna thrive yourself. It's kind of a selfish thing but you, you don't do it for selfish reasons but that's, that, that's what you get back. And so I think a lot of us are kind of too big in our own ego and we need to think more about others and so. 

01:01:30
 Thank you, thank you. 

01:01:30
JON CARLSON I wanna thank you all. Thank you very much for this experience. Thank you.
