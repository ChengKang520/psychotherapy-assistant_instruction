OLGA SILVERSTEIN  Even Thetis, dipping her mortal boy in Styx, dreaming of honoring him against both worlds, dripping her joy in fatal fingers, allowed the dim danger of her handhold on his heel. How could she bear to lower him, knowing the yearning of the Naiads down below, hearing the sibilant whispers urging him to swim, feeling the small arched body straining to let go. If immortal mothers are to such folly prone, how am I to guard against the thumbprints on my own? I wrote that when I was feeling very frightened about the notion of raising a boy. Everything we knew even then, everything in the culture told us that, uhm, you had to let go, mothers have to let go of their sons. I think that as therapists whom have have made certain assumptions as we all do about all of our work and those assumptions are embedded in the social structure and in the culture that we live in and we kind of accept those assumptions as reality and as truth. So we're more apt then to say mothers for, for instance, if she's in with her son, back off, leave him alone, you're on his back too much, all of that kind of thing, when I suddenly realized that, in fact, why? The truth is that most of the time women have legitimate fears and worries and when cautioned to back off and leave the boy alone or turn him over to his father, it invalidates everything she feels and knows about her child. And it not only distances them but it gives the boy a very powerful message which says, "Your mother doesn't know and you should not listen to her and you have to be your own man." And that's even a very good child, but that message then is powerfully, ah, absorbed in a culture in which individualism and differentiation and being your own person of the highest values, and so in fact therapists following those assumptions will act on them. In fact to, ah, exacerbate the distance between the woman in the house and the boy in the house, the mother and the son. 

00:03:00
Mothers and Sons THE CRUCIAL CONNECTION OLGA SILVERSTEIN, MSW THE ACKERMAN INSTITUE FOR FAMILY THERAPY 

00:03:00
OLGA SILVERSTEIN  Relationship with one's mother, whether for a male children or female children, is probably the most intense love relationship in anybody's life, certainly in the early years that, intensity of that is what carries you through your entire life. However, for, if a mother is really, uhm, nervous about what she, about the intensity of the feelings that she has for her son and feels that in somehow those feelings are going to be harmful to him, she will begin to guard her, uhm, expressiveness, her emotional expressiveness, to begin to push off a little bit, to be careful that there isn't too much of that intimacy even with an infant, even in mysterious imperceptible ways, even with an infant she will feel sort of a, ah, distance that she needs to keep her distance. The message to mothers that they have to back off is embedded in notions or descriptives about what it means to be a man to begin with strength, aggression, competition, ah, success, all of these things and what it means to be a woman which is caring, empathy, nurturing, worrying about others, communicating with another human being in a human way about what you feel, all the cautionary tales that say, "Be careful, you don't want to make a girl of him," as though being a girl is somehow a terrible thing that you don't, ah, as though, in fact, we could do that. I mean, that's another assumption that if a man were to have those qualities, he would then somehow be feminized and that's again because of those two separate descriptives. So we get those messages from the day that a little boy is born. Therefore, of course, you can make the next jump which says, "If in fact a boy is of a different species and you are to be very careful not to impart any of your feminine characteristics because that's going to, ah, corrupt his masculinity, right?" then, of course, the message is very clear, that a woman alone cannot raise a man. She cannot, at best she's gonna raise a mama's boy, a sissy, a weak man, ah, all of those. These days, there are more and more women-headed households or women raising sons by themselves alone, fearful of their own inability to handle it, fearful of the boy because we know, I mean, one of the things that is very powerful in this culture, that a woman cannot control a man. I've ha, I've had women with three-year-old sons running rampant in my office and I'll say to her, "Ah, are you gonna do something about that?" And she'll say, "Oh no, no, he's a boy. I, I don't wanna to control him. I can't control him. I'm a wom, you know he's, right?" So it starts at a very early age and we let the boys run us crazy because we're not suppose to control them, 'coz if we control him, we somehow rather emasculate him. It's not only, uhm, we're accused of emasculating our husbands and grown men but even of little boys, so you can see that women alone are in fact traumatized. The clinical piece(ph), of course, is that I see so many mothers that are a little worried about their children, particularly about their teenage boys. I recently saw a mother and her 15-year-old boy. Of course, this was only an hour of a demonstration interview. This mother has been a single mother for, well, I guess since the boy was very little, since the boy was, what, about three. So she has raised him and she's raised two daughters. 

00:07:35
CARMEN Well, my problem basically is that he doesn't wanna go to school. If he goes, it's to hang out. He doesn't go to his classes. So for the past week I hadn't been sending him 'coz what's the sense of him going if he's not gonna go to classes? 

00:07:50
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Uh hmm, you know, why would you choose not to go to school? 

00:07:55
JOSEPH 'Coz I don't like school and she's always, I mean, personally, I mean I don't like the school. (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
OLGA SILVERSTEIN  Uh hmm. 

00:08:00
JOSEPH I hate school. 

00:08:00
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Well I, I can understand that. I never liked school either but, ah, why don't you go? See, that's not the same. Hey, if, I understand that. It's not fun. It's pain, but why don't you go? 

00:08:10
JOSEPH So I can have fun. 

00:08:15
OLGA SILVERSTEIN I see. (After some exploration of the school and her worries about that, she tells me what I see is the real fundamental problem, her worry that Joseph doesn't follow her, that in fact he will not be able to resist the leadership of the stronger boys in the street.) 

00:08:35
CARMEN Well, he does whatever the, the other kids want him to do. If they say, "Let's cut," he cuts. "Let's leave the school," he leaves the school. 

00:08:45
OLGA SILVERSTEIN And if the other kid said, "Let's rob this house." Will you do that? 

00:08:45
JOSEPH No. 

00:08:45
OLGA SILVERSTEIN  What do you think? 

00:08:50
CARMEN I, I hope that he wouldn't, but then I don't know him anymore. 

00:08:55
OLGA SILVERSTEIN He seems like a very bright young man. 

00:08:55
CARMEN  He is. 

00:09:00
OLGA SILVERSTEIN What worries you? 

00:09:00
CARMEN What worries me is that he's gonna get killed in the street one day. 

00:09:05
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Okay, okay. 

00:09:05
CARMEN Drugs, (crosstalk) 

00:09:05
JOSEPH I don't. (crosstalk) 

00:09:05
CARMEN the alcohol, I'm not you, I'm not saying you do. I don't believe you are. I'm saying that it could happen. He's a follower. 

00:09:15
OLGA SILVERSTEIN (Joseph admits that he has recently joined a gang "The Zulu Nation" which truly now, it becomes more and more apparent the things that Carmen is really concerned about and feels that she can't handle.) Well, I understand what you're worried about. Now, what you've done is you sent him to counseling. You did a, you got a big brother for him, is that what. (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
CARMEN Well, he doesn't have one yet, no. 

00:09:40
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Oh, you applied for a big brother? 

00:09:45
CARMEN Yes. (inaudible ) pin(ph). 

00:09:46
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Now tell me what your thinking is behind that? Why do you think he needs a big brother? 

00:09:50
CARMEN Well, because I think he needs someone, we're all girls in the house. I think he needs a father figure. 

00:09:55
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Why? 

00:09:55
CARMEN Because I feel that little girls, when we grow up we pattern ourselves if we have good mothers against some mothers. 

00:10:00
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Uh hmm. 

00:10:00
CARMEN That's how we are. That's how we, that's how I will, I'm able to take care of my children and give them love because I got that love. 

00:10:10
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Uh hmm. 

00:10:10
CARMEN Now, he needs a man, a role model. So he could learn how to be a man. (crosstalk) 

00:10:15
OLGA SILVERSTEIN He's, (crosstalk) 

00:10:15
CARMEN That is the way I feel. 

00:10:20
OLGA SILVERSTEIN he was born male. 

00:10:20
CARMEN Yeah, but it's not. (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
OLGA SILVERSTEIN And what, what can you do as a role model? 

00:10:20
CARMEN  I bo, I'm not a man and I can't, I can't, I can't be... (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Well, okay. (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
CARMEN ...what a man is... (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
OLGA SILVERSTEIN But, that's true. 

00:10:30
CARMEN ...a father is to him. I could give him love. 

00:10:35
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Uh hmm. 

00:10:35
CARMEN I could show him morals. I could so, show him what's right and what's wrong. (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
OLGA SILVERSTEIN  Okay. 

00:10:40
CARMEN But a man's figure I think is important. 

00:10:40
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Okay. Tell me what else you, you feel that you as a woman can teach him that maybe a man can't. 

00:10:45
CARMEN  I guess how to be sensitive. 

00:10:50
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Uh hmm. 

00:10:50
CARMEN  Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:10:55
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Uh hmm. 

00:10:55
CARMEN how to treat ladies, women. 

00:11:00
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:11:00
CARMEN When he gets mad at me like he treats... (crosstalk) 

00:11:00
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Uh hmm. 

00:11:00
CARMEN ...his wife or anyone, any, any young girl out there. 

00:11:05
OLGA SILVERSTEIN How about how to take care of himself? 

00:11:05
CARMEN  Ah, well, ah, yeah, okay, which he doesn't wanna do, but. (crosstalk) 

00:11:10
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Well, it looks to me like he's all in one piece. 

00:11:15
CARMEN Well, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
OLGA SILVERSTEIN She's a strong woman. She's a very capable and strong woman. I don't think that doubts herself and her a, ability to love, control, and so on. But she holds back because the idea that only a man should be able to control him or tell him what to do or lead him into a kind of aggressive manhood into that aggressive manhood, uhm, which is to find this true masculinity, he would have to have a male role model. So, I call that, you bring the domestic police, you know, back into the house (laughs) to keep the boys in line. The assumption there, again you see if you look at the assumption, the assumption is that the boys are acting out because there is nobody bigger than they are to control them and that you need a man who's stronger than he is, or bigger, or who's gonna control the boy. Because boys, in some way, are wild beasts who cannot be controlled and therefore we have all this violence because there is no man in the house who would control them, as though male violence, adult male violence, isn't rampant in the culture. Instead of doing the conventional thing and telling her not to worry so much and to back off and leave the boy alone, I tell her that, in fact, she is a very good mother and can in fact provide the role model to those things that Joseph will need in his life. 

00:12:55
OLGA SILVERSTEIN But see, I think you worry about the wrong things. I wor, I think you worry too much about male role model for him. He has too many male role models as it is. 

00:13:05
CARMEN He has too many... (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Yeah. 

00:13:10
CARMEN ...male role models? 

00:13:10
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Yeah. That's part of the problem. That he's got all these tough kids who are... (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
CARMEN Okay. 

00:13:10
OLGA SILVERSTEIN  in the neighborhood who are role models for the boys. He needs much more of the role model that you could give which is where you teach him honesty and integrity and caring for other people. 

00:13:25
CARMEN But that hasn't been enough. 

00:13:25
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Hmm. He's only 15. He's gonna struggle against it, 'coz there's all that outside influence from the outside world, and they look down on a boy who's too tender-hearted or who's too nice, right? Even girls... (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
JOSEPH (inaudible ) 

00:13:44
OLGA SILVERSTEIN  want you to be tough. So how do you hide the nice part of yourself? 

00:13:50
JOSEPH By acting tough. 

00:13:55
OLGA SILVERSTEIN By acting tough. Yeah. But it's there, hmm? 

00:14:00
JOSEPH It's there. 

00:14:00
OLGA SILVERSTEIN It's there. 

00:14:00
JOSEPH And I think it's (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:14:03
OLGA SILVERSTEIN I know it's there. Does your mom know it's there? 

00:14:05
JOSEPH Yeah. 

00:14:05
CARMEN About the tender part of him? No, I don't know it's there. 

00:14:10
JOSEPH Yes, she does. 

00:14:10
CARMEN No, I don't. I don't see it. 

00:14:10
OLGA SILVERSTEIN You don't see it but. (crosstalk) 

00:14:10
OLGA SILVERSTEIN  I asked his mother if she knows that tender side of him, and she says no, she doesn't, she doesn't see that side. And I know by that statement that she'd rather not, that that's the side that really worries her, that clearly, if you would agree with her assumption that a boy like Joseph who, in fact chose some softness, ah, will not survive in the street. If you buy into that as a truth rather than as an as, ah, assumption you would tend then to, ah, join with Carmen in trying to toughen Joseph up. Not(ph) in fact do the opposite. 

00:14:55
OLGA SILVERSTEIN I think you're a terrific mother. 

00:14:55
CARMEN Uh hmm. 

00:14:55
OLGA SILVERSTEIN  Okay? As hard as it is, you stick with him. You don't abandon him. You stick with him and it's hard work. It's hard work in the world we live in to raise a boy, where being tough is the, you know, it's what counts. It's very hard and you have to stick with it. A few more years, he doesn't go to school, at some point in his life he will make up his mind that he wants a decent life as a man, he'll have to do something about it. 

00:15:30
OLGA SILVERSTEIN I saw this family as sort of a demonstration interview as part of a workshop I was doing at the Ackerman Institute and there were quite a few, ah, people who had come to the workshop of therapists who, who were watching on closed circuit. After I finished the interview, there was a sort of a shocked(ph) silence, sort of like, you know, wait a minute, that was a terrific interview but I don't know why. Are you telling us that, uhm, just because he has a good mother, he's gonna be okay? Aren't you worried about his joining, he's gonna join this gang and then he's, since he's a follower, he's gonna get into serious trouble and all of which, ah, I would expect was the kind of responses you would accept based on the old assumptions, particularly about the boys in the ghetto where we think they really have to be tough, right? They have to be tough in order to survive. And I always point up if they don't survive, do they? In fact therapists following those assumptions will act on them, in fact, to, ah, exacerbate the distance between the woman in the house and the boy in the house, the mother and the son, and to, in some way to push him toward a more male, uhm, community. Whether it's a community of his peers or whether it's a community of men in the family, but for the mother to sort of, and again it becomes her job or it became her job to facilitate the, uhm, connection between the father and the son. I remember many times myself and I know. My husband's reading the paper and go out and play boil, uhm, play ball with the boy. Do something with the boy. The boy needs his father, right? That's an assumption. Not that boys don't need their fathers, we all need two parents. But to assume that what's important is the disconnection from the mother and that's kind of an old, ah, Freudian leftover, you know, that at six or so the boy is supposed to make this Oedipal leap from his loving mother to his feared father, which if you think about it for a minute, you see what an absurd notion (laughs) that is, that any child would leap from the arms of a loving parent to, into the arms of a frightening, threatening parent. I don't think that, that's, but we do force them to do that. 

00:18:10
OLGA SILVERSTEIN  I see a tremendous, tremendous change in two years. (Two years later there was a follow-up interview, in which Joseph, now 17 years old, sits next to his mother. Their relationship seems to have improved enormously.) 

00:18:30
CARMEN He, he's, he on his own, he want, wanted to get his GED. He's doing that. 

00:18:35
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Uh hmm. 

00:18:35
CARMEN I'm really proud of him. I really feel so happy. My heart sings everyday because... (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Wow! 

00:18:40
CARMEN ...he's, I, I really feel proud of him. 

00:18:45
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Yeah, he'd made some good decisions... (crosstalk) 

00:18:45
CARMEN Yes. 

00:18:45
OLGA SILVERSTEIN ...for himself. 

00:18:45
CARMEN Yes. 

00:18:45
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Uh hmm. 

00:18:45
CARMEN I'm very happy for him. 

00:18:50
OLGA SILVERSTEIN (And all of those fears about his sort of, not making it in the world of being too soft, of not finishing school seems to have evaporated and, of course, the questions is, "How come?" And it's the changes in Joseph that are really startling. He suddenly now, at 17, he's a young man. He seems to value the soft part of himself considerably more than he did. Not only to value, it but to use it well.) I don't know if you remember but two years ago I asked, ah, you, (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
JOSEPH Yeah. 

00:19:25
OLGA SILVERSTEIN  what you do with your tender feelings? Remember that? 

00:19:30
JOSEPH No, I don't. I don't remember it. 

00:19:30
OLGA SILVERSTEIN  And you told me, you said you act tough. 

00:19:35
JOSEPH Did I? 

00:19:35
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Uh-huh. Well, you didn't say to me, "I don't have them," which a lot of kids might say. You said, "I act tough." 

00:19:45
JOSEPH Yeah. 

00:19:45
OLGA SILVERSTEIN So, I guess you knew it, you knew it even then, that you needed to do that... (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
JOSEPH Yeah. 

00:19:50
OLGA SILVERSTEIN ...to act tough. 

00:19:50
JOSEPH To act togugh. Well, I think I'm also probably this tough. I'm not, I'm not always acting. I think I act a little more tough than I already am because that's what, what I have to be. 

00:20:00
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Okay. 

00:20:00
CARMEN I think, I think you'd probably say no, but, that he's... (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Hmm. 

00:20:05
CARMEN ...learned the toughness from me because it's, I'm alone. I don't have a, (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Uh hmm. 

00:20:10
CARMEN  a husband. I've had to fight for myself. (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Uh hmm. 

00:20:15
CARMEN I didn't fight but I mean, (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Yeah. 

00:20:15
CARMEN you know. 

00:20:15
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Absolutely. 

00:20:15
CARMEN  Ah, and he has seen me, I, ah, when I don't think something's right with... (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
JOSEPH She knew everything about this. 

00:20:20
CARMEN  whoever it is. 

00:20:25
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Huh? 

00:20:25
JOSEPH She would take no part(ph) of it whatsoever from anybody. 

00:20:25
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Yeah. 

00:20:25
CARMEN And. (crosstalk) 

00:20:25
OLGA SILVERSTEIN  Well, that's the whole thing. You see, when you say, well, what are we saying to other mothers, single mothers particularly who are raising their sons? What is it that we wanna tell them? I don't think there is a bad message in that, that a woman can teach her son how to be tough when he needs to be. 

00:20:45
CARMEN When he needs to be, exactly. (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
OLGA SILVERSTEIN As well. (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
CARMEN And he has to know the difference. 

00:20:50
OLGA SILVERSTEIN That's right, that's right. So, it isn't that, I mean, people tried to, these days, particularly to convince us that you can't do it, that a woman can't do it, that you need a man. (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
CARMEN Which is wrong. 

00:20:55
OLGA SILVERSTEIN  That it's only a man, but you know you can because you've done it. 

00:21:00
CARMEN Maybe because you can, I did it, sure. 

00:21:00
OLGA SILVERSTEIN That's right. 

00:21:00
CARMEN You don't need a man. You need man if he's good and caring and kind. But if he's not... (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Absolutely. 

00:21:05
CARMEN ...you know, then you don't need him... (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
OLGA SILVERSTEIN No. 

00:21:05
CARMEN ...at all. No. No. 

00:21:10
OLGA SILVERSTEIN But you also can teach your boy to be, take care of himself... (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
CARMEN Exactly. 

00:21:10
OLGA SILVERSTEIN ...to be tough what he needs to be and that's an, a very important message. 

00:21:15
OLGA SILVERSTEIN His mother has one remaining worry. It is that Joseph swaggers down the street as though he owns it and, ah, without any modesty or shame and she worries that that would be dangerous for him. He reassures her that that's what protects him, that he understands the streets and he knows that he has to look tough on the street, and that he can look tough when he needs to, and be soft when he needs to. 

00:21:45
OLGA SILVERSTEIN  Whenever you say to a mother, no matter how nicely you say it, even if you say things like ah, "Take a vacation, mother. Let your husband do the hard work. Back off," it doesn't fool anybody. It certainly doesn't fool the mother or the son because the message hidden in there is very clear. You are the cause of your son's problems. And if in fact, the mother gets that message, she backs off, she abandons. In a sense, I think of it now as abandoning. She will pull back sharply. The father may or may not move in. The father may move in somewhat, but mostly the boy gets the message that you're not, you're really not to be connected to your mother in any way because it's just not helping you to become a man or the kind of man that is socially acceptable. Now, suppose you start with another set of assumptions which says that men are people, they're not just men. They have the same qualities. I mean, if women would not be so arrogant as to think that we're the only species on the earth that have a gift for intimacy, friendship, nurturing, caring, empathy, that in fact, all human beings have the same abilities and qualities, though we have them in different proportions, but those differences are not based on gender, they are based on characterological differences. Now, if we were to set that assumption that in fact men have those feelings, they have never been taught to express them. And if we also accept the assumption that it's good to have those feelings, not only good but necessary that we have, where generations have deprived men of the luxury of a near, of a real intimate relationship with, with another woman, whether it's his mother or wife or daughter or friend, that we have actually made it difficult for men to have that kind of intimate relationship or to be in touch with himself. That he has to be a role, who gets up in the morning, goes to work, earns a living, comes home, does or does not help with the dishes, and goes to bed, right? And then his yearning for intimacy becomes channeled into sexuality needs, and that's how both he proves that he's a man and that's his sense of intimacy. And then the woman in, in the therapeutic situation, of course, will tell you that very bitterly, his idea of intimacy is sex and I can't have sex with somebody I don't feel intimate with. (laughs) He doesn't talk to me and then he wants to make love to me and I'm not feeling sexy. So there you are, right? Now, we said if we start with a different set of assumptions, that in fact, men are human. They're just not that much different, maybe a little bigger, a little stronger physically, some of them, not all of them. If you accept that as an assumption, then in a therapeutic situation, your whole set is different. Now, you're not into blaming the woman for wanting something from him that he doesn't have or shouldn't have because he's a man, right? Then you're much more into helping him to access those feelings, to recognize them, to be able to verbalize them. You can validate them. You can help her to understand how he has to struggle for what he has lost out on in his early relationship with his mother. That for him to be able to make that leap from masculinity into humanness is gonna take a little time and that he needs a little help with that. Your whole focus shifts, that she's not unreasonable and he's not ungiving(ph). But he has to learn how to access the feelings that were actually denied him. And my mother said to me once I was very young and complained about my marriage and she said to me, "He makes a living and he doesn't drink?" I said, "That's right." She said, "Well, then, stop complaining." As I was working clinically, I realized that those are not satisfactory answers. Not only I thought they're not satisfactory, they're very sexist, which say women need to put up with a lack of intimacy, a lack of connectedness in their, with their partners and if he helps in the house, you should, that should be enough for you. What else do you want? So, on the one level and my work was going on, at the same time, of course, like for all therapists, the other part of my life is going on. So, the two parallel lives, one, the work life, and the other, the private life. Not just with my husband, which of course, was beginning to shift and change as I began to shift and change and I wanted more from him than I had in the early years, different. And then my son, who by this time, was in his early middle age and had a heart attack when he was 45. And that blew me away. That hit me in ways that's just almost impossible to describe. I mean, my own sense of fear, grief, terror. He had a triple bypass operation at that time. I was at the hospital and some very smart person had sent to this ward where all these men had had bypass operations, had sent a cartload of teddy bears. And as you walk down the hall and saw these men clutching their teddy bears to their chest, it was the most poignant, I can't describe the feeling that I had it in seeing this and realizing what was missing in their life. That only with this near-death experience could a man allow himself to clutch a teddy bear. I really began to feel an enormous sense of sympathy for the men who cannot, ah, express their feelings, who've been taught not to express them, who think that masculinity is, ah, consists of being a silent sufferer, who carry heavy burdens but are not permitted to admit fear, weakness, vulnerability, which are human emotions. They're not gender- defined.

OLGA SILVERSTEIN Most feminists believe that boys can't be raised by a woman alone and the most sophisticated and liberated of women go chasing off in desperate search of a male role model for their fatherless sons. (As I've been out on the road with the book, speaking at various bookstores, radio stations, I hear the same questions over and over again. The basic questions are, "But I don't want my boy to be different. I think that what you're saying is right. I wish that we could believe that and I wish we could behave that way. But if my boy is less tough and less ambitious and less aggressive, he's not gonna survive in this world.")

  'Coz I know when my son was little and I saw him cry when somebody took something away from him, my first thought was, "Oh, my God, I'm raising a wimp." Rather than whatever. (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
OLGA SILVERSTEIN (And my answer to that is that we have to look at the reality, in fact, men don't survive in this world, that boys are now shooting each other, killing each other in the streets, that we send our youngest and strongest boys to war where we kill them, that men, you know, die very early with heart attacks and other, uhm, attributes of their masculinity.) Somebody else should write another book. One book isn't gonna do it. Hopefully, my hope is that I started something and that other people are now gonna pick up and they are, in fact. Ah, next month I'm going to, and I think it's very exciting, I was invited by the men's study group of the Haverford School for Boys to come and talk to the parents. 

00:30:55
 To the parents? 

00:30:55
OLGA SILVERSTEIN Yeah, well not to the boys, (laughs) ah, to come to the parents and the staff of the school. I think that's very exciting. So, in that way in, the ideas proliferate. It's all we can do. I thank you very much for coming.
