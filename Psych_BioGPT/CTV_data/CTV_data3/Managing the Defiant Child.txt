This video tape is presented by Gilford publications. At the conclusion, you will find information regarding additional Gilford titles by Dr. Russell Barkley. 

00:00:10
NARRATOR Alex can’t get her son to comply with simple requests. 

00:00:15
ALEX Why can't you help me to pick this from sofa. 

00:00:20
CHRISTOPHER I don't know how. 

00:00:20
ALEX Yes you don't know how. Let's pick up the crayons that Lissy left out please. 

00:00:25
NARRATOR This frustrates Alex and her husband Jim. 

00:00:25
JIM Everything was in tizzy. George wouldn’t respond any… any direction, ah…very defiant. You could… you could ask him to do something, he pretty much tied up and saying and walk away, you know. 

00:00:35
Put it down. 

00:00:40
NARRATOR Christopher frequently refuses his mother instructions. This undermines her self-confidence. 

00:00:45
ALEX I doubted my own parenting skills. It was very frustrating, very upsetting, very tiring. 

00:00:55
Lets go see how big it is. 

00:00:55
No. 

00:00:55
NARRATOR And Valerie can be aggressively defiant, much to her parents distress. 

00:01:00
We've to set limits with her, but she could not stick to the limits. And it became a cycle of her doing something bad, her being disciplined or feeling about herself and just escalating and getting worse. 

00:01:15
When behavior such as these are frequent and persist over time, there may be symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder, unrecognized and untreated, ODD can have a significant impact on the relationship between parent and child. 

00:01:35
Managing the defiant child with Russell A. Barkley 

00:01:40
NARRATOR It is estimated that between 3 and 7% of all children may have oppositional defiant disorder. 

00:01:45
Not going to… right now. 

00:01:45
Come on. 

00:01:50
NARRATOR Without effective clinical interventions, these children will likely experience difficulties at home, in school and in the community. 

00:02:00
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY , Ph.D. Professor of Psychiatry University of Massachusetts Medical center Worcester, Massachusetts Hello, I am Dr. Russell Barkley. I’m a professor of Psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester, Massachusetts. There are many reasons for choosing noncompliance and the underlying family dynamics that give rise to it as the focus of treatment. Oppositional defiant disorder also known as ODD, is usually the result of poor chemistry between parent and child. A unique interaction of ill fitting temperaments. However clinicians and parents have a unique opportunity to intervene in a positive way that may help secure a better future for these children. 

00:02:35
NARRATOR Because oppositional defiant disorder is so deeply rooted in the relationship between parent and child, the focus of treatment is on the parent specifically through parent training and behavior modification. 

00:02:50
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY By using better management skills with children’s behavior problems, parents can improve child compliance enriching the parent-child relationship and enhancing the child’s developmental outcome. 

00:03:00
The concepts of child management The principles of managing defiant behavior A model for parent training 

00:03:00
The treatment approach that Dr. Barkley uses is group training for parents. This 10-step program explores the roots of oppositional defiant disorder and provides parents with tools and techniques to began to modify negative behaviors in their children. This video will explain the concepts of child management. Discuss the principles for managing defiant behavior and present Dr. Barkley's model for parent training. We would like to acknowledge the contribution of several families who agree to participate in this program. They were generous and courageous in their willingness to talk about their ordeal with oppositional behavior. These families hope that others in similar circumstances may benefit from their experiences. 

00:03:50
The concepts of the child management Immediacy of consequences 

00:04:00
NARRATOR Because much of the nature of ODD can be found in the relationship between parent and child, one of the most effective ways to improve the behavior of a child with this disorder, is parent training in behavior modification. Underling the principles of parent training are several concepts that are important to understand in order for parents to improve a child’s behavior. The first of these concepts is that consequences for inappropriate behavior must be given immediately. 

00:04:30
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Consequences for child behavior be a positive or negative must be provided as immediately as possible if parents are to gain effective control over inappropriate behavior. Parents need to provide consequences immediately after the occurrence of the behavior rather than waiting several minutes or hours to confront the problem or to reward the appropriate behavior. 

00:04:50
Specificity of consequences 

00:04:50
NARRATOR The second concept is that consequences for inappropriate behavior must be very specific. 

00:04:55
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Consequences especially verbal or social ones should be quite specific. Both praise and criticism should refer to the behavior at the issue instead of being vague or general. Similarly, the consequences should fit the transgression and not be based on the parents level of impatient or frustration. 

00:05:15
Consistency of consequences 

00:05:15
The third concept in child management is that the consequences for inappropriate behavior must be consistent. 

00:05:25
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Consistency applies to three things. First be consistent across settings. If a behavior occurs that is generally punished in one environment, say in the home, then it should also be punished in other environments such as in stores. 

00:05:35
Use rewards before punishment 

00:05:40
NARRATOR Parents must also learn to use rewards before punishment. 

00:05:45
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Punishment for inappropriate behavior should not be introduced until the parents establish a specific program for rewarding the behavior they want their children to perform instead. Sometimes it becomes a habit to punish rather than reward in order to stop the unwanted behavior. As a result, punishment becomes the major form of interaction in the family and children really receive approval for what acceptable behavior they may have shown. 

00:06:10
Anticipate and plan ahead for misbehavior 

00:06:10
NARRATOR It is also important to anticipate and plan ahead for misbehavior. 

00:06:15
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Many parents are as impulsive in their reactions to child misbehavior as their children are in reacting to various events. This results in parents spending tremendous amounts of time managing misbehavior while investing minimal if any time in anticipating and possibly preventing those situations in which the children are likely to create problems. 

00:06:35
Family interactions are reciprocal 

00:06:35
NARRATOR Finally, it's necessary to understand that family interactions are reciprocal. The parents behavior toward the child is partly a function of the child’s behavior toward the parent. The child’s behavior is also partly a function of how the parent treats the child. 

00:06:55
VALERIE (ph) Mom you do it I told you. 

00:06:55
NARRATOR Because of this by directional influence between parent and child, it’s difficult to assign blame to either party when conflicts arise. 

00:07:05
ALEX Now pick that up… 

00:07:05
NARRATOR What then does cause these chronic forms of oppositional behavior? 

00:07:10
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Negative encounters between adult and child seem to be initiated when a parent gives a command that is not considered enjoyable by the child such as picking up toys, cleaning up their room or doing homework. 

00:07:20
Command Given Command Ignored Command Repeated Emotions Rise Warning Given Warning Ignored Warning Repeated Emotions Rise 

00:07:25
Typically the oppositional child fails to comply. In turn, the parent repeats the command. This is rarely met with compliance and so the command is repeated. The parent soon become frustrated and emotions begin to rise. A warning may be issued that a punishment will follow. Yet the child may still fails to comply with a threat in part, because the parent frequently repeats it. So the threats lack credibility and often go enforced. Overtime, both the parent and the child’s emotions escalate further and the situation dissolves into an angry, defiant, and sometimes destructive encounter. 

00:08:05
Okay, we got a Lissy Jack(ph) over here. 

00:08:10
LISSY (ph) No. 

00:08:10
No, yes. 

00:08:10
LISSY No. 

00:08:10
We're going to sweep it up. 

00:08:15
LISSY No…No…no…(inaudible ) 

00:08:20
Okay and let’s go and see how big it is. 

00:08:20
LISSY No… 

00:08:25
Because…. 

00:08:25
Usually what happen is she began to get anger that would escalate all away from you know, no I'm not going to do it and we kept pushing her that would escalate to you know kicking and pushing and shouting and may be breaking something. Ah…If you look around the house, you’ll see things that are broken that I haven’t got time to fix yet. But there is lots of broken things in our house. 

00:08:45
NARRATOR Parents often wonder why their children continue to defy them. When they know, they will ultimately be forced to perform the task. The key to understanding this situation is to see it from the child’s point of view. Adults tend to look at the situation in its entirety and are able to see that ultimately, they will always make the child perform the command. Children, however, view this as a moments of moment interaction with their parents in which the immediate goal is to escape during the requested task if only for a moment. 

00:09:20
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY This may help to explain why parents are often puzzled that the child spends more time avoiding the requested task as well as arguing or defying the parents than it would have taken to do it. The moment by moment procrastination of the child is doubly reinforcing in this sense. Allowing the child to continue in a desired activity while for the moment successfully avoiding the unpleasant task being imposed by the parent. The ultimate outcome of the interaction either punishment or forced compliance is sufficiently delayed so as to have little if any influence on the child immediate behavior. 

00:10:00
The principle of managing defiant behavior 

00:10:05
I tend to put buffers on between us. It’s like I back off to give him a space, but then he just goes wild, so now what I’m… 

00:10:15
NARRATOR When parents give in, defiant behavior gets reinforced. And the child learns to respond in the same way in future interactions. According to Dr. Barkley, this pattern is what underlies the negative encounters between parents and children. The goal of parent training is to break that pattern. One model for parent training is the one utilized that the University of Massachusetts Medical Center. Many similar programs can be found around the country. Dr. Gwenyth Edwards is a clinician who trains parents of ODD children at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center. 

00:10:50
GWENYTH H. EDWARDS ,Ph.D. Assistant Professor of Psychiatry University of Massachusetts Medical Center Worcester, Massachusetts The goal of our program is to improve child behavior. But in fact, the real goal of our program is to permanently alter parenting practices not just during the 9 or 10 weeks that this program takes place, but forever, so what we’re doing is adjusting the environment around the child, the parent being an enormously significant part of the child’s environment. 

00:11:20
JIM George did you set the table? 

00:11:20
GEORGE Yeah 

00:11:25
JIM Wow! 

00:11:25
NARRATOR Before undertaking parent training, Jim and Alex were unable to get their son George to comply with even the simplest directives. Frustrated, they enrolled in the program, despite their initial skepticism. 

00:11:40
JIM When you started the class, you know you have a lot of mixed emotions here. You know you’re, your parenting skills and your mind are on the line here. You know if thinking well, "Here I’m, I think I’m a bad parent you know because I can’t deal with my child but I’m going to go and I’m going to let some bigwig tell me how to deal with my kid. And when we got into the class, it wasn’t like that all. There were other parents in the class that they were suffering the same problems and everybody was pretty much going through the same thing. 

00:12:10
ALEX I was always trying to get George to do things and it was more of George do this. Before it's George's time to brush your teeth, he’d sit there. George and I…where we have to get right in his face and say "Come on, it's time to brush your teeth." Now, we don’t have to do that anymore. He gets dressed by himself, I mean everything that we had trouble with he just does and that is definitely result from the class. 

00:12:30
GWENYTH H. EDWARDS Parent management training is probably the most crucial thing that a family can do to address these difficulties. When parents are faced with a difficult child and perhaps faced with stress and the family lives these days are full of stress. Umm…stress from umm.. two parents working two jobs, a single parent economic stresses what have you and with stresses the background and a very difficult child to manage temperamentally, parents are often, frustrated and had a loss, they are not well prepared or well equipped ah… to use parenting strategies that are going to be the most affective and efficient strategies for allowing their child to behave successfully. 

00:13:25
ALEX Lets go bring it in the kitchen. Go bring. I'll give the balloon after you bring that into kitchen for me today. 

00:13:35
[sil.] 

00:13:40
ALEX Thank you very much. You just put them on the (inaudible ). Six months ago, he would not even picked anything up. He would have just walked around, walked around it and I would have been saying it repeatedly and that would escalated into an argument. Thank you very much George, I appreciate your help. 

00:14:00
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY A well designed training program should give parents several important and useful techniques. 

00:14:05
GOALS OF PARENT TRAINING Using incentives Using a token system for positive reinforcement 

00:14:05
NARRATOR The first is to learn how to use incentives to get the child to comply. For example, giving the child a clearly defined set of rules about behaviors that will be permitted and those that won’t. Second, how to use a token system as a tool for positive reinforcement. As simply its seems, tokens have been shown to be powerful motivators for children in a range of settings in school, at home, and in public places. 

00:14:35
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Tokens which can be anything from poker chips to stickers are given when a child behaves appropriately. When a certain amount of tokens are accumulated, there can be exchange for more desirable reward or activity such as playing video games, watching television, going out to eat or going to the movies. 

00:14:50
How to use discipline effectively 

00:14:55
NARRATOR It is the meaning rather than the value of the tokens that seems to capture the child’s interest. And both parents and teachers who use them report that children respond very strongly to tokens. The third goal of parent training is to have parents learned effective methods for disciplining their children. For example, the use of time outs particularly with younger children. 

00:15:20
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Having a clearly defined system of consequences for inappropriate behavior is far more effective than indiscriminant and overly harsh punishments. 

00:15:25
PROGRAM MANUAL managing the defiant child How to manage public behavior 

00:15:25
NARRATOR For further information on the implementation of procedure such as tokens and time outs, please refer to the manual which accompanies this videotape. Another goal of parent training is teaching parents how to manage their children’s behavior in public. 

00:15:45
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY There are four things parents should do before entering a public place with their children. First, establish the rules that child would be expected to follow before entering. Second, establish the reward for compliance such as a certain number of poker chips or points for good behavior. Third, let the child know what the consequences will be for noncompliant behavior. And finally, assign your child some activity to do to help with the trip or to keep them busy. 

00:16:15
A model for parent training 

00:16:20
GWENYTH H. EDWARDS Think about how…how you want to make your request as specific as possible to…to either of you have a homework request… 

00:16:25
I…I think I’ve tried to be very specific with him and I tried to maintain that, maintain everyday. 

00:16:30
GWENYTH H. EDWARDS Okay. 

00:16:30
Session 1 Why children misbehave 

00:16:30
NARRATOR The parent training program at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center is divided into 10 weekly sessions. The first of these is a discussion on why children misbehave. The purpose of this session is to teach parents the typical process of child misbehavior and what parents can do to identify such causes within their own children and families. 

00:16:55
GWENYTH H. EDWARDS If you’re child by nature has difficulty regulating his or her behavior, then under the influence of that excitement, you may see increased behavioral difficulties not necessarily defiance or arguing although you may even see more of that, but even increased activity level and impulsivity. 

00:17:15
Session 2 Paying attention to behavior 

00:17:15
NARRATOR The second session explains the parents that there is a correlation between the amount of attention they pay to their child’s behavior and seeing improvements in their behavior. 

00:17:25
GWENYTH H. EDWARDS We talk about the basic concepts of behavior management or behavior modification. We talk about how to view behavior as sort of the…this…that the…the…centre of what’s between two book ends and it’s the two book ends that parents can have control over. One is anticipating the behavior before it has a chance to happen and the others providing a consequence after the behavior takes place and we help parents understand that the way that they use consequences or predict behavior ah… is under their control and if they make changes in those areas, the child’s behavior will change. 

00:18:10
VALERIE Hmm… I have learned a lot to anticipate her reaction, so I can umm… I can judge how I’m going to handle things actually before they start. If it's been umm…a trying day and I just anticipate the escalation, then I can avoid the situation altogether. Offering the rewards before the situation gets out of hand, it's always the best. 

00:18:40
Session 3 Methods for increasing compliance 

00:18:40
NARRATOR The third session focuses on methods for increasing compliance in children. The goal of this session is to teach parents how to recognize positive behaviors when they occur and encourage those behaviors by responding with appreciation and praise. 

00:19:00
GWENYTH H. EDWARDS We move into the specific strategies for parents to practice at home, and we start with the positive strategies, and we do so for several very important reasons. First of all, families who have had a long history of behavior problems are often very depressed and demoralized and so starting with the positive strategies can really lighten the tone in families and give people a sense of optimism that "Yes, we can turn this around." 

00:19:25
Getting in something accomplished ummm…to go to finish step A, and then to go out to step B could take an hour where might take you like 15 minutes. 

00:19:35
GWENYTH H. EDWARDS Hmm…hmm… 

00:19:35
So going and reinforcing that, you know like getting in uniform for practice. "Wow! you really going fast here." I said "You going too fast for me and he, then he gets motivated and… 

00:19:45
Yeah, excellent. 

00:19:50
So that type of….ah…I mean. 

00:19:50
GWENYTH H. EDWARDS That’s very nice to hear you have some response…Another reason is that often with children who have difficult temperaments, the amount of time that we spend reprimanding or disciplining are those children can be 95% of the time where as the amount of time that we spend in positive interactions is less than 5% of the time. When the situation is that imbalanced, the punishment strategies parents are using are going to be as effective and the child isn’t going to be motivated to what to work for the parent change their…their behavior for their parents, so we start with the positive strategies in order to create a more balance situation. Well that’s I’m after, is for all of you to become so familiar and so comfortable with doing this, that it…it's second nature to you, not only to correct or reprimand a misbehavior, but to notice and go out of your way when a misbehavior doesn’t take place and go find your child and praise him for the appropriate behavior and that’s not traditional parenting. Most parents don’t do that. They just take it for granted that the appropriate behaviors going to take place… Now many families say, "Well nothing positive ever spontaneously happens in our household", so what we have to do is catch the child being good or even set him up to do something well, and then praise him for it, and parents are give a couple of specific little exercises to practice at home where they will have more opportunity to use praise as a reward for compliance with request or the absence of misbehavior. 

00:21:40
EFFECTIVE COMMANDS Be sure you mean the command Present the command as a direct statement Make sure the command is simple Make eye contact Remove any distractions Have the child repeat the command Set a time limit Session 4 Implementing a reward system 

00:21:40
NARRATOR Another key strategy thought in this session is how to give effective commands, first be sure you mean the command about to be given and be willing to see the task through to its completion. Second, present the command as a direct statement not as a favor or question. Third, make sure the command is simple one rather than multiple. Fourth, make eye contact with the child while giving the command. Fifth, remove any distractions in the area before giving the command. Sixth, have the child repeat the command back to make sure he or she understood the request and Finally, where appropriate set a time limit for when the task should be completed. In the fourth session, parents learn how to implement a motivational program that uses a variety of rewards and incentives to increase compliance. 

00:22:35
GWENYTH H. EDWARDS We begin to ah…look at the more significant behavior problems and how to increase compliance for more difficult request ah…such as household chores, getting homework done, that sort of thing, and we set up a token economy system or a point system. You will have two lists to post. When you're ready to go, you'll post the list of request and I have a handout about this and you’ll post the list of privileges and certain numbers would be assigned to each one and you'll tell your child. From now on, if you do what you're asked to do on this list, the first time you're asked to do it, you will earn this number of points or chips and I'll give them to you. Then, if you want to do something that’s on this lists of fun things, you'll have to give me that number of chips or give up that number of points in your check book right. Imagine that you explain… This comes right out of the behavior modification, ah…literature. It’s a very structured approach umm… which allows parents to become increasingly specific and what it is they ask of their children and use incentives to encourage more appropriate behavior, specific tangible incentives, not things that families have to go out and buy and spend lots of money, but actually using day-to-day desirable activities that the kids might take for granted, but parents begin to label or identify as privileges. If something is a privilege, you must earn it. Today, get a little bit harder a little bit more challenging and let me explain why before I actually get into the nuts and bolts of this token economy system. What we’re going to do today is to begin to make the distinction between children’s rights and their privileges. Right is yours no matter what, a privilege is something that you earn. Now, once you are able to make that distinction, you'll find that a lot more control is just automatically back in your hands. 

00:25:00
ALEX One other things, we used were the poker chips as a reward system as tokens and we just explain to George that these were the things we wanted you to do and we didn’t make the list long, because we knew we have to keep it short in simple form and he just had three tasks and if he did those task when we asked him, he would get a reward with a poker chip or two poker chips depending on the measurement and once he had some poker chips saved up, he could turn those in and he'd able to do something fun that he wanted to do. For example, go bike riding would take or work in his dad shop, and build something and I’d say after just the first couple of days of the poker chips, he started looking for poker chips and he made the connection instantly I didn’t even bring it up, so he started thinking rewards versus negative behavior, "Mummy yelling at me", and it just turned him right around. 

00:25:50
Session 5 Implementing a discipline system 

00:25:55
NARRATOR In the next session, parents learn how to use disciplinary methods when positive reinforcement and rewards don’t generate compliant behavior. 

00:26:00
GWENYTH H. EDWARDS If you don’t do what you're asked to do, the first time you asked to do it, you might lose a privilege. Ah…if you violate a household rule, if you hit someone, if you call someone names, if you use four letter words, you might lose a privilege ah… and parents are thought how to do that, in a fair and consistent way, and children are given the plan ahead of time. They know what to expect and then, we introduce the use of our timeout system, many parents are very familiar with timeout, but they don’t use it properly. They either over use it or they use it in a way that is not very effective, so we teach them the most effective way of using a timeout procedure ah…and that is reserved for the most problematic behaviors. 

00:26:55
Session 6 Refining discipline 

00:26:55
NARRATOR The next session reviews any the parents may have had in implementing the timeout method. The majority of this session is spent reviewing instances in which time out was used. How the parents felt about it, problems they may have encountered in its implementation, and any minor adjustments they may have to be made in the parents use of the procedure. 

00:27:15
Session 7 Managing behavior in public places 

00:27:20
NARRATOR In the next session, parents learn how to use a modified version of the treatment procedures for managing child misbehavior in public places. 

00:27:30
GWENYTH H. EDWARDS Restaurants, grocery stores, visiting other families home, shopping malls, all the places where parents may have been embarrassed in the past. We give them strategies using what they’ve been practicing at home, the token System, the use of rewards and incentives, and penalties or even a timeout to address behavior problems in public places. 

00:27:55
We’re gonna walk in the mall and you can look at things outside, now… 

00:28:00
Whatever behavior, you would like them to portray is what you tell them, and if they do act up and do whatever you’ve asked them not to do, then you've to stop whether their standing up against the wall, so you can all of their attention or having them sit and timeout for a brief minutes and explain. Because you're kind of like running, and that’s not okay. And then say that’s not okay. Now would you tell me what I just said isn't okay, having them respond back to you, makes you aware that they've heard you and they know what is acceptable. I want you to tell me why we’re sitting. 

00:28:45
I don't know. 

00:28:45
We're in timeout. 

00:28:45
Yes, we're in timeout. 

00:28:50
Yeah. 

00:28:50
Now, we're gonna walk, not jump… 

00:28:50
Yes. 

00:28:55
We cannot jump through the store and you cannot run. 

00:29:00
Okay. 

00:29:00
Want to try it again now. 

00:29:00
Yes. 

00:29:00
Thank you. 

00:29:00
Session 8 Addressing problems at school 

00:29:00
NARRATOR Next session addresses problem behaviors that may be occurring at school, although parents cannot always be expected to help teachers with the classroom management of their children, there are ways, in which parents can utilize incentives within the home to reinforce better behavior in the classroom. This is typically done through the use of a daily school behavior report card combined with home based rewards systems such as the tokens. Samples of these handouts and exercises can be found in the manual that accompanies this video tape. 

00:29:35
GWENYTH H. EDWARDS So we give parents a set off, of handouts that they can share with teachers and away to tie the home token economy system and to whatever behavior problems teachers may be addressing at school. 

00:29:50
Session 9 Managing Future Behaviors 

00:29:50
NARRATOR In the 9th session, parents are instructed in how to use the procedures they have learned for other problem behaviors that child might develop in the future. 

00:29:55
Session 10 Booster Session 

00:30:00
GWENYTH H. EDWARDS After our 9th session, we want parents to have an opportunity to practice on their own. These are new skills. Unlike any new skill, you need a chance to practice ah…in order to see if you have mastered the skills. So we give people an opportunity to go off on their own knowing that they can call if they run into difficulties, for perhaps about a 4-week period of time. And then we set up our 10th session, ah…which is essentially at that point of booster session to go back and review where have you had problems where have you had successes, have there been question that have come up that you didn’t feel you're able to answer and at that point in the program what we expect is that parents have the skills and the tools to address any sort of difficulty ah…that might come up with their child’s behavior. 

00:30:50
Understanding the defiant child Russell A. Barkley 

00:30:55
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY In this program I've described the concepts upon which the management of oppositional and defiant behaviors are founded. Particular emphasis was placed on the 10 individual steps of the parent training program and their sequence. My hope is that these methods and techniques may assist the many thousands of families who cope with these behavioral problems each day. If you would like more information about the origins of oppositional behaviors, please know that in addition to this program, there was a companion video tape understanding the defiant child. That program provides an overview on the nature of oppositional behavior, its causes and the processes that take place in the family that seem to contribute to the occurrence of this disorder.

NARRATOR When Jim and Alex first came to parent training classes, their relationship with their son George was highly negative. What they learned about George and themselves has literally turned their lives around.

JIM After you go through the class and you get out into the world of actually using it, it’s ah… so easy, umm… once you… you have the skills done of…of the positives versus the negatives and such that, that you just see the child lied up and everybody relaxes and it just goes a lot easier.

ALEX I think his negative world is positive now. I think when we first went into this all, George was hearing was negatives. You know no matter what we did, it was negative because he was disobeying, he wasn’t doing things we asked him to do, so we didn’t look at that that’s what he was seeing, but I feel it that’s what he was seeing. Now we’re so positive on everything, and he just feel so much better about that he’s positive and we all just click.
