RICH SIMON Welcome, everyone. My name is Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker and I'm your host for this series on Men in Therapy. So, um, one of the issues in dealing with this whole question of men in psychotherapy and why men have a difficulty in the therapy relationship, according to most practitioners, and there are some statistics that, perhaps a third, no more than a third of the clients in psychotherapy are men. Um, is this whole question of differences between men and women, which is a very loaded issue, and this, um, and this has a long history. Male, um, quietly, because in our patriarchal tradition, if it's male, it's better. So this, we're been over the last 20, 30 years, um, um, as there are a lot of shifts in our thinking about differences between the sexes, this has been a very politically loaded topic we have someone who's intrepidly willing to journey into this whole theme, men and women, someone who's a, a great innovator in our field of master therapist and someone who's been, uh, uh, quite a few times for Psychotherapy Networker, and presented repeatedly at our conference, the author of "How To Improve You Marriage Without Talking About It", a subject near and dear to many men, which she co-wrote with Steven Stosny, uh, my good friend Pat Love. Pat. 

00:01:45
PAT LOVE Hello! Glad to be here. 

00:01:45
RICH SIMON So, um, let's start off here with this sort of a, uh, a question from your own experience. As a woman, uh, what is your, ha-have you experienced over the years you've been, you've been, you were a, uh, someone who has lots of experience as a therapist, have you, in the course of your career, have you had any particular difficulty, or special difficulties in working with male clients? 

00:02:15
PAT LOVE It's interesting because the uniqueness of my experience is, I think, that I haven't had that difficulty. I've actually discussed this with colleagues and supervisees who would say to me, "I can't get men to come to therapy", and I would, at first I would just like, "really?" And then I had to look at why that had not been my experience. And the truth is, that I feel like I've had positive experiences getting men to come to therapy, and once they're in therapy, engaging them. So that's been my experience. 

00:02:45
RICH SIMON What's, so, what's, share your secrets with us, Pat. So, what do you, what do you feel, as you became more aware of that, what is it that, uh, what did you conclude about your track record? 

00:02:55
PAT LOVE You know, I've had to look at it and it helped when I began reading the gender science and, uh, what I used to say, if a woman called me and said, "I want to come to therapy, I want to work on my relationship", and I say, "it's better to bring your partner", and she would say, "he won't come", I would say, "well, ask him if he would help you and I work with his presence, because I need him to be there for this to be effective". 

00:03:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:03:20
PAT LOVE And somehow, as, in looking back, retrospect, I realize, using the words, "I need him" and "it would be helpful", uh, were, seemed to be the key words. Um, secondly, when he came, first of all, if he came as an adjunct to her therapy, I honored that. Because I was trained years ago in transactional analysis, which is, you get a contract, you keep a contract, and you're really honest with the client. So, if he came to, as an adjunct to her therapy, I only used him as a resource. Then, of course, I don't think I ever had a, um, man come, who wasn't then, able to see that therapy is really so helpful and so supportive to each person, so once he was there, I think being sensitive to his point of view, and then thirdly, I think what helped, is that I've always had a curious mind and research, because I began as a graduate professor and I loved research and curricullum development and putting practice, you know, putting acts into practice, I think because I worked very directly and very factually, and scientifically, I quote research in my, in my practice, in my therapy, and when I see it applicable. I think that appealed. I had a lot of men say I really like your science, I really like the facts. I really know what the logic is behind us doing this. So, some of it was intuitive, some of it I just learned from my clients and then, when I got the gender science, wow, it just made it so much more effective. 

00:05:00
RICH SIMON Okay. So we're, later on, in this conversation, I want to get to some of the, these, the practical application of your ideas and some of the ways in which you handle these, uh, typical situations and in couples therapy and, uh, particularly situations where some therapists have difficulty with men. But let's start off with the science here. So, what is, so the science of gender differences. I, I, I like that phrase. Tell us about that. What is, what do we know about other than our assumptions and our, all of the kind of the cul-, the myths and the cultural notions about men and women, what's the difference? What is, what's the state of the science of gender science and what are seem to be the important differences that have been scientifically validated that are emerging? 

00:05:50
PAT LOVE Well, first of all, I think it's important that the differences don't apply to all men or all women. I think that if you could, Steven and I have a slide we throw p on the screen that says men are taller than women and then Steven and I are up there, and you know, I'm like six inches or whatever taller than he is. 

00:06:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:06:10
PAT LOVE And we always say that, that science predicts for groups better than individuals or research does. And so, I like to think of men and women on a continuum from testosterone dominance to estrogen dominance. We know that two-thirds of men fit in to what we would call more of the male thinking, male physique, male behavior,cand have more of a masculine brain style. There are about 30% of women who fit into that category. If they have high testosterone they don't talk as much, they don't talk about feelings. It's interesting, that, when if a if a woman is pregnant with a female child and in the third trimester, she's administered testosterone, to prevent premature birth, then the female child will have a speech pattern more like a male speech pattern. And that, again, it's not, and all that means is she will use fewer emotionally laden words... 

00:07:10
RICH SIMON Really? 

00:07:10
PAT LOVE Well, yes, she will talk less about feelings she'll also have better spacial relations, she'll be able to read a map upside down. 

00:07:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:07:20
PAT LOVE So, we know that we're all on a continuum, uh, in terms of styles. And, and what I think what's so important is it doesn't have to do with capacity. So, you know, because these gender differences, as you eluded in the beginning have been used to repress women, and I understand the opposition. But the science can liberate (inaudible ) has to do with mainly, is impulse and motivation. You know, for example, one of the differences, if you look at a female, typical female, let's just say estrogen dominant female and you look at a functional MRI. When she's talking, she's getting little squirts of dopamine in the pleasure and rewards center, she's getting a little high from talking about almost anything. The typical male, most men, don't, it's not that they don't like talking, they just don't get high from it. So talking in and of itself, isn't as pleasurable. Men will talk just as much as women, if there's a point, if there's a reason. 

00:08:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:08:30
PAT LOVE I figured that out, you know, somehow. And now I apply that to therapy. So, in fact, here's a little uh, thing to remember, women talk, women talk to connect, men have to connect to talk. 

00:08:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:08:40
PAT LOVE When a man feels connected, like he's not gonna be criticized, blamed, shamed or there's a point to it, he will talk just as much as women. In fact, men talk more in public because usually, in that forum, there's a purpose, there's a reason. Uh, you know, there's a strategy. So that's something important to remember when you're doing therapy, is women talk to connect, men have to connect to talk. 

00:09:05
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:09:05
PAT LOVE And by the way, I teach men that to touch a woman's heart, talking as well as listening gives her pleasure, says 'I love you', you know, feels supportive. And, and that's so important to many, many women, and those estrogen dominant men. 

00:09:25
RICH SIMON Okay. So, alright. So you say impulse and motivation are these two areas. Fill that, unpack that a little bit for us. So impulse, what are the differences in this, on this category of impulse? 

00:09:45
PAT LOVE Yeah. Well, one of them as I just mentioned is just to talk, just to be talking. You know, if there's silence in the car because my introvert, not only male, a more testosterone dominant male, but an introvert, here to fore, I would get anxious feeling like I'm being unfriendly. That I should be talking, of course I would get pleasure from it. So my impulse is to talk, his impulse is to enjoy the silence, and by the way, because men measure intimacy by proximity, are we under the same roof? He's having an intimate moment with me in silence. You know, women meausure intimacy by participation. You're not talking to me, this is a good example of this. I had a girlfriend, she and her husband went on a weekend road trip, they're pulling in the driveway and he turns to her and he says, "I think that is he best weekend I've ever had with you". And she said "what?!" She said, "you didn't talk to me the whole time". You know, like she was furious, he was full of love and romance, he believed because they were under the same roof the whole weekend. 

00:10:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:10:55
PAT LOVE So these gender differences really help explaining and, and making you have more, make you have more compassion, uh, it's really, in some ways cross cultural experience when you begin to understand male and female differences. 

00:11:10
RICH SIMON Two different cultures. 

00:11:10
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:11:10
RICH SIMON So... 

00:11:10
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:11:10
RICH SIMON So, and then, so you said, uh, in, in that example there's a motivational element of the talking... 

00:11:25
PAT LOVE Talking...Yes, yes, another, um, another, this is a really important one. The impulse to help and how to help. We know that we've identified, a scientist, a neuroscientist identified at least two empathic systems. There's the MNS the Mirror Neuron System. 

00:11:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:11:45
PAT LOVE And the Mirror Neuron System, these mirror neurons enable me to feel what you're feeling. You know, we watch a movie, we get moved. I see you yawn, I want to yawn. You know, that I feel what you're feeling. And that's the classic empathic system that, when we say do you have empathy, that's usually what we mean because that's been our traditional definition of empathy. But now we know, there's another empathic system called the TPJ. Temporal Parietal Junction System. The TPJ works like this, I see that you're sad, I register that sadness, immediately and the analysis fix-it part of my brain, goes into over drive and I want to alleviate the sadness immediately. And so this is where the, the analyze and fix it part of your brain, is just as empathic. And guess which gender uses which most? You know? Most women, yes, use MNS, most men use the TPJ. And, and again it doesn't mean he can't slow down and just listen, but it's like his brain is on fire, his impulse is to alleviate your suffering as quickly as possible, that's why he tends to advise or give a suggestion or interrupt your emoting with your feelings. Does it mean that he can't stop and listen and mirror, empathize and validate? Of course not. 

00:13:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:13:20
PAT LOVE You know, it, because all I do is I say let me, and so I might even show them in session. 

00:13:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:13:30
PAT LOVE I would say, "I'm just gonna get you to listen for the pain, just for a moment. Look at her with soft eyes, listen for the the pain and maybe then, just say back what you're hearing her say", you know, and I let her talk, and he talks then listens, and I might even stop it when he's listening with those soft eyes when he's tuned, tuned in, and, and, and I might let her talk let her see that curiosity and interest and intunement on his face And then I might say, I might say to her, "what is it like having the man that you love... 

00:14:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:14:10
PAT LOVE ...tuned into you? And then I get her to tell him how moving it is. Often times she'll tear up, you know, I'll tear up, I have the MNS too. You know, and people really get it, "wow, he's listening!" I don't have to give a lecture, we can show him, in that session, how just listening touches her heart and how it moves her and puts tears in her eyes. 

00:14:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:14:35
PAT LOVE So, that's, that's just an impulse, you know. But, but it doesn't mean that after that happens I might, I might teach her or even do a little tiny, you know, psycho-education, but saying, TPJ, MNS so he gets how you fell, and can you then step into his world and understand how giving advice or trying to fix it or move into action is just as empathic from a different point of view. So, it's because, it doesn't mean he can't learn to listen. 

00:15:10
RICH SIMON Right, right. 

00:15:10
PAT LOVE I mean his impulse might be that way, but learning it retrains his brain, makes him more mature, gives him more flexibility and versatility. You know. 

00:15:20
RICH SIMON So, so let's stay with this psycho-education theme for a moment. So that's one piece... 

00:15:25
PAT LOVE Yeah. 

00:15:25
RICH SIMON ...of this psycho-educational input that you offer about the brain which is you, you've really been somebody, uh, is one of the first people I know of, who really began to try to integrate this information about brain science into their clinical methods. So say a little bit more about what kind of, the, the what other psycho-educational information about the brain and brain differences that you typically weave into your, uh, early stages of your psychotherapy with couples. 

00:15:55
PAT LOVE Yeah. Yeah, um, we know that, um, I gave that example about the testosterone in the third trimester, and often times we assume, it's easy to assume because men don't talk about feelings, that they don't have feelings or they don't experience feeling to a deep level. Actually, there's evidence even to the contrary that men feel more deeply in many ways. And so, I will train her, when I see this deep feeling in his, his paralinguistics, you know, around the eyes, the color of the face, his eyes tearing up, you know, the muscles tightening around the mouth, I will train her, I say, "I'm gonna get you to look at this face..." 

00:16:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:16:45
PAT LOVE ..."loving you". Or, "this is a man who's heart is broken because he can't please you". Whatever the feeling is. So, I might teach her, you know, because he's not talking his impulse is to feel it and then move into action but her impulse is to think, he's not talking about it so he doesn't have feelings. You know. 

00:17:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:17:10
PAT LOVE And I think, so she wants, so I tea-, I, I, I go against the impulse and re-train her to see his feelings instead of only being able to hear his feelings. 

00:17:20
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:17:20
PAT LOVE Does that make sense? 

00:17:25
RICH SIMON That, that's so interesting. I do, my wife Yen(ph) and I do couples weekends and as you know, and so, these moments you've just described so perfectly... 

00:17:35
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:17:35
RICH SIMON ...some simple exercise where a man will, will express an appreciation of the way his wife puts flowers on the table that seems, you know minimally, uh, emotional, and you'll get exactly this, this very full and very sweet emotional response on the part of the woman, just in this way that you're describing. 

00:17:55
PAT LOVE Yes, and let me just say, here's another, I think, really important psycho-educational piece, and this one probably changed my practice more than anything. 

00:18:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:18:05
PAT LOVE And this is what Sherry Taylor at UCLA gave us, almost 20 years ago now, that she got to looking at coping strategies and she looked at the developmental literature and found that of all the developmental studies on coping strategies were only conducted on male subjects. You know, for years, women weren't used in research... 

00:18:25
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:18:25
PAT LOVE ...because it was believed that their hormones would taint the study, etc. 

00:18:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:18:30
PAT LOVE So she threw in women, that's what we know as tend and mend and tend and be friend(ph), which is a primary coping strategy of many and most women. 

00:18:40
RICH SIMON Say that one more time, Pat, there's a little distortion on this end. 

00:18:40
PAT LOVE Yeah. That, that she discovered that women, in addition to, addition to fight and flight, had a coping strategy that she named tend and mend or tend and befriend... 

00:18:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:18:55
PAT LOVE ...and, and I like, I think it's really important to understand this, because, if you are the person, not only that gives birth to the babies that's not why the women did the care-taking necessarily. It's because we had the food source. 

00:19:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:19:10
PAT LOVE You know, we had the breasts so the babies had to stay with us so if I have (inaudible ) fighting and running, isn't the smartest way to stay safe? And so she determined that women came up with this collaborative style that was reinforced, if you watch my back, I'll watch your back, then we can all stay safe by learning to read subtle emotions all of our senses and all the mammals, female senses are more acute... 

00:19:35
RICH SIMON MM-hmm. 

00:19:35
PAT LOVE ...they talk, they communicate, they read each other's cues, they notice, you know, they, they multi-task and notice, and anticipate your needs. That's how they stay safe. So if you just look at that coping style, and then know that because that's the coping style, this makes most women hyper sensitive and vulnerable to isolation, deprivation, and neglect. So you, even if it's two women together and one's more testosterone dominant and she's not talking, or she's not talking about feelings, or she uses you know, intimacy is proximity and not participation, I the estrogen dominant woman, I feel neglected, isolated and the fear just takes over and controls my brain. Not only can I not feel sensual and sexual towards you, but I don't fell loved by you. 

00:20:40
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:20:40
PAT LOVE So, that vulner-, the primary vulnerability of most females is isolation, deprivation and neglect. And so, when you're not talking, communicating, participating, supporting, helping, engaging me... 

00:20:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:20:55
PAT LOVE ...I feel like I'm alone in this relationship. My fear takes over and, and it looks from science that there's a limit to empathy when it comes to female fear and terror. It's not that men don't feel it, the closest they get is on the battlefield. 

00:21:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:21:10
PAT LOVE But, but what women feel when he goes silent, or he stonewalls, or he's unavailable, or he works long hours and isn't there, or there's dishes and the house is piled up and you don't see that I'm overwhelmed, when you neglect me that way and you don't offer support, that terror, literally keeps my limbic system on alert and I cannot feel close connected, sensual and sexual toward you. 

00:21:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:21:40
PAT LOVE Now, flip over to this other side that, so this makes women hyper-sensitive to silence and feeling like she's ignored and not having that daily engagement. Okay? Flip over to the other side. Because men, for eons, not just this century, have been required to provide and protect. You know, they were given the grand prize to pass on their DNA. The strongest, most powerful, status oriented male, you know, that's not just this century, but that's the brain we're living with. Remember, that's the brain we're living with. 

00:22:15
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:22:15
PAT LOVE Because he was required to do that when he cannot please or perform. His shame, which is a stop and hide emotion, again, it's a limit to empathy the cortisol dump. I likened it to a taser, you know, that goes through his system when he feels like he has let you down, somehow, not provided as a, as partner, a lover, a parent, or, you know, somehow not not giving you the life you deserve. This is why when a woman is unhappy about anything, he feels like a failure. Women don't get this. Listen, it's not even about you. I just need to vent here, and he's like, yeah, but if I were doing my job, in his head, you would never be unhappy again. You know? 

00:23:05
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:23:05
PAT LOVE So these impulses, and if, just being sensitive to vulnerability, uh, and, and, and, because for example, criticism is a big one. Just clinically, this could change your practice. It changed my practice. 

00:23:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:23:20
PAT LOVE Women, because of tend and mend, we, we hear a criticism or complaint as an invitation to move closer. I've called my girl friend, "I'm having a terrible day, you don't know what happened", "what, honey, you want me to come over?" In fact, she even feels a little special that I called her and, you know, not one of my other girl friends. But if I call my husband and say, "I'm having a terrible day", he feels like, sooner or later, it's gonna be his fault. 

00:23:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh! 

00:23:50
PAT LOVE And women, women don't understand this, you know. And when I say this in therapy, so women, then you know what, the response I get is, "does this mean I can never complain?" Because it's sort of what we like to do when we get together as women. 

00:24:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:24:05
PAT LOVE All you have to do is, behind every complaint is a desire. Behind every criticism is a, is a desire. Cut to the chase. 

00:24:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:24:15
PAT LOVE Tell, tell him what you want. Make it PMS remember this, positive, measurable, specific. I love it when you sit down and talk to me about your day. It makes me feel loved when you just walk in the kitchen and, you know, start unloading he dishwasher. I mean... 

00:24:30
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:24:35
PAT LOVE ...not only catch them in the act of doing what's right, because, remember, he lives, in many ways, to provide, protect and to make you happy. In fact, here's my bias. My bias is men like pleasing women more than women like pleasing men. That's my bias. 

00:24:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:24:50
PAT LOVE And, you know, if you want to see a romatic couple, look at a gay couple. I mean, oh my, I often wondered why this was the most romantic couple I've ever, you know, I see, is these gay couples who, who I love you more, no I love you more, they just take that competitive love to a whole new level. And, um, so again, it's, it's really about honoring the difference, understanding the impulse, it doesn't mean he can't listen, doesn't mean... 

00:25:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:25:20
PAT LOVE ...she can't complain, but put it in a way he'll hear it as a request, as a desire, as a way to touch your heart. 

00:25:30
RICH SIMON So you've, in effect, give, given us, uh, a whole, uh, psycho-educational packet of psycho-educational equipment, of information that we can use in therapy. So in the, how do you use it? Would it sound, in working with a couple, would it sound more or less, uh, in this lovely adamented style that you just, um, described, this to us, or how do, how much you adapt, how do you, how do you if you do adapt this in the therapy context and where's it at? 

00:26:00
PAT LOVE You know, I do every therapy session the very same way, and I might mention that I rarely do an hour session, my sessions are always longer. Usually, a local couple, I say a minimum of three hours, if we don't need it, we won't use it. Most couples come to me for all day, for one, two, or three days running. Okay, having said that doesn't matter, whether it's an hour, two hours, hour and a half, I have three steps. And this just has evolved over the years. 

00:26:25
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:26:25
PAT LOVE First thing I say just about every situation, "how can I help?" If you left here and you said, wow, that was worth the time, money and effort, what would be different. So I get a contract, I really, and I am serious about these contracts. I write it down, I keep it in the back of my mind and then, when I say, "how can I help", they give me the agenda, that becomes my outline for the session and then I start looking for step two, which is causality. What is it that's keeping you from getting what you say you want from each other? Okay? 

00:27:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:27:00
PAT LOVE Causality, because then, within the causality, I try to start getting it happen. If she says, he doesn't talk, he never tells me anything he doesn't talk to me, I don't know what he's thinking, I don't know what he's feeling, he says she doesn't respect me, I don't get appreciation. I then, start trying to make that happen, and when I see how, for example, she says, he doesn't talk enough, and when he does talk, she interrupts him, I'm either going to intervene in that, and I'm gonna get you to hold that just for a second, we'll come back... 

00:27:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:27:35
PAT LOVE ...cause I'm, I want you to help him to give you what you say you want. 

00:27:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:27:40
PAT LOVE I want, cause, look at his, look at his face. And I don't say this unless I mean it or see it, I say this is a man wanting to please you. 

00:27:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:27:50
PAT LOVE But I'm gonna get you to look, and, it's a, you can help him, by being wel-, that's it, that's that look, welcoming... 

00:28:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:28:00
PAT LOVE ...in this moment. And then, and then I get him to go ahead and talk. So I'm looking at causality... 

00:28:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:28:05
PAT LOVE ...and sort of, you know, going ahead and, and then, and then cause the third step is congruance. I wantto give them what they say they want and get them to experience it in the session. 

00:28:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:28:20
PAT LOVE Now, after, so the most often way I use research is maybe after the fact, you know. That, and I might say to her when you and are sitting down and having coffee, we interrupt each other because we know, first of all, we can keep the thought, we can multi-task and we just get ex-, that just says I'm excited, I'm agreeing with you and, you know that's a common female style. 

00:28:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:28:45
PAT LOVE Um, and, and so for, with, and if you want him to talk more and talk longer you just sort of, you know, close your mouth, breathe and take that in and that helps him give you what you say you want. 

00:29:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:29:00
PAT LOVE So, you know, and I might just talk about our styles are different, and, uh, and how it's amazing when I say something like, this is, this isn't, this is your partner who wants to please you. When I see that, and I point it out, he will be so moved, and will he be boo-hooing and blowing into a Kleenex, no. 

00:29:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:29:25
PAT LOVE He'll be, his eyes will tear up, the lines around the eyes will change, the flesh color will change, you know, the, the the muscles around the mouth, you know, the eyes are great because you know, they're autonomic, they're these autonomic muscles around the eyes that you can't control, so that's why they say eyes are the window of the soul, and when I see that, when I'm watching for these paralinguistics, I want him to see it, I want her to see it, cause it's really there. You know I was trained as an assistance therapist, so I try to get, change the system. You know I try to get changes to occur in the system. Not just treating the symptoms. I try to give them a taste of what they say they want. 

00:30:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Okay. So, uh, this is so cinematic, I'm watching you and, uh, watching your faces as, uh, you do this and your demonstrating for everyone watching this, this, I feel like I'm very much in a session with you, this is terrific. So, um, so when you, uh, work as a supervisor with, uh, other therapists or you watch videos of sessions where couples therapy gets stuck, or guys shut down, what do you, what are the, what are the things you're describing a way of, of moving into this other perspective of, uh, how you help other peole understand and move beyond differences. But when it does break down in psychotherapy, what do you see and how do you help therapists. What are the two or three things that you see, uh, most often, where we get into trouble in trying to get men engaged in psychotherapy? 

00:31:00
PAT LOVE Well, the first one is sort of obvious, and that is when you expect a man to act like a woman, or vice... 

00:31:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:31:10
PAT LOVE ...or vice versa, or if I, I'm yeah, um, or, it could be the case that I had recently, where a, the complaint was he didn't act like a typical man. 

00:31:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:31:25
PAT LOVE And then I, you know, I even have handouts I often, you know use and I look, I show them that continuum, from, you know, estrogen, testosterone dominance to estrogen dominance and the behaviors that go with those. You know, cause, 30% of men are more the nice guys. They're the ones who do talk more, so who do talk about feelings, who need to feel connected before they can feel sexual, for example. Um, I, so that's one. So, I'm really looking to confront stereotypes, whether it's between and among men and women, or within the males and the, you know, female gender. So, I'm watching for that, number one. 

00:32:10
RICH SIMON Stay with that number one for a moment. So... 

00:32:10
PAT LOVE Okay, yeah. 

00:32:15
RICH SIMON ...how do you do that so you, you, um, you don't expect men to act like women,and the example you are give, the 30% of men who are sort of what you're... 

00:32:25
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:32:25
RICH SIMON ...But in the first idea of, we get into trouble when we expect men to act like women. Well, how do you see that, how do you... 

00:32:30
PAT LOVE Yeah. Yeah, well, one is we expect him to talk about feelings. 

00:32:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:32:40
PAT LOVE And to volunteer that, and to want, I can't tell you, I have a large percentage of women who want me to come in and work on their childhood. 

00:32:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:32:50
PAT LOVE Which, which usually mean I want him to emote and to, to you know, examine and tell how bad it was and to complain and to be vulnerable and, um, you know, boy that, by the way, that's, that's sort of a trap. Because, when a woman, when a man gets vulnerable and talks about being, well, you know the truth is I'm really scared I'm gonna lose my job and I feel deprived and we haven't had sex in, you know, two months and feel like you don't, those usually aren't the feelings and the vulnerability she wants to hear. Because if he's scared, then she's naturally prone to the fear, then she feels like "whoa!" you know, we're gonna lose our house. 

00:33:35
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:33:35
PAT LOVE And when woman say that, what they usually mean is what I want is you to talk about how you love me and how your life wouldn't be the same without me. 

00:33:45
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:33:45
PAT LOVE So, one is, okay, so that's one, let me tell you another one that just came to my mind. This is the one Steven Stosny and I, my co-author, were doing a workshop on men and women. And, uh, there was a couple in the front row and the woman raised her hand, she said, "you can settle an argument for us and tell us who's right." We knew right then, this, this can't go well. 

00:34:10
RICH SIMON We're in trouble here, okay. 

00:34:10
PAT LOVE Yeah, she said, "our 12 year old son was playing this weekend, he got in a fight with his buddies, he came in the house mad," she says, "my husband says, 'get out and get back in the game'." And she says, "I told him, 'no. you go apologize and you say you're sorry. You know you're going to play, these are your best friends, you're going to be playing with them, get out there and apolo-'." Women want words. Men want behavior. 

00:34:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:34:40
PAT LOVE And this is so different because often times in therapy she says, "if you're sorry, you would tell me, you would be vulnerable, you would fall on your soul's, you know, sword, and emote", and he's saying, and, and you know, so she wants the words. If you're sorry you will express it with remorse. His point of view is, you know what, words are cheap. If you are truly sorry, remember, TPJ... 

00:35:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:35:10
PAT LOVE I get it, I goofed, I, I, you know, I messed up. I failed you. Okay, I get it, TPJ. He says, if you're truly sorry, words are cheap, anyone can say words. 

00:35:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:35:20
PAT LOVE If you're truely sorry, you will push rewind, you will strike it from the record, you will auto-correct it so that it, it never happened and your behavior will pick up and move on as if it never happened. And of course... 

00:35:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:35:35
PAT LOVE ...for many women, this drives them crazy. You're repressing, you're denying, you're not sensitive, you're don't know how much this hurt me. He did, he does know how much it hurt you, he is remorseful, and he wants to show you that his behavior will prove it. Now, again, impulse motivation, not capacity. Can he learn and say the words to touch her heart? Absolutely. Can she watch his behavior and know that this is a male apology? Absolutely. You know, and so, whomever wants to grow up first... 

00:36:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:36:15
PAT LOVE ...or whomever wants to move the ball forward for the relationship. You know, and I just pointed out there, and either one of you could do this. You could both do it. It's just a difference. Difference doesn't mean deficient. Difference doesn't mean wrong. No, it's simply another way. So that would be another motivation and impulse that would show up different in therapy that I hear a lot of times. Um... 

00:36:40
RICH SIMON So let me see if I understand what you've just told us here. So, uh, it, and so it sounds like how you, so you're pointing out how these are, the obstacle is when we expect there's a single way both sexes are supposed to handle... 

00:36:55
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:36:55
RICH SIMON ...stress and, uh, conflict and so on. And as a therapist, you're, it sounds what you're describing so far, is you offer a kind of a zone, of, of a evolutionary psychology brain science perspective where you detoxify... 

00:37:15
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:37:15
RICH SIMON ...these, what, what these dead end arguments by making space for both alternatives. Is that, is this... 

00:37:20
PAT LOVE Yes, yes. And, and I take it a step further, and you just reminded me of something that happened recently. 

00:37:25
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:37:25
PAT LOVE A couple in a real, real tight spot, heterosexual couple, he, he's overwhelmed. Every part of their life is under fire. You know, the job is requiring an enormous amount of time and energy and the stress there is off the charts, the kids are just, you know they're having to go to classes to try to learn better parenting with their children, the marriage, she's a one on a scale of ten, and ten being highly committed. You know, she's lost heart, you know, money is crunched, they just found out they're gonna owe all this money, they've lost money in the stock market, I mean, every single part. And she, what she's asking of him, she's criticize, she was criticizing him, and talking about him not being sensitive to her because he wanted to make a plan. He's saying, let's get a plan. And, and she was like, you don't care, you don't, and, and all I said, I could see it on his face, and I said, "my hunch is I just think because men feel, feel such an obligation" cause he's the primary bread winner, you know, "my hunch is, every part of your life that's important to you", I just looked at him, "right now feels like it's sinking, it's a sinking ship. And I imagine your head is about ready to ex-, your brain is exploding, with wanting to fix this... 

00:39:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:39:00
PAT LOVE ...and to make it better for her. And for the kids." And when I said that, he, he, he did break down. He couldn't talk. He was so validated and so moved, and that's when I say, this is, this is a man who is longing to, to make this better, and you know, I'm gonna get just a look, cause this is what longing, this is what motivation and help you and the family and the kids, you know, this is what it looks like. So, so remember the TPJ, I'd already talked to them about that, remember that? This is him really getting your hurt. 

00:39:45
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:39:45
PAT LOVE And really wanting to, to eleviate that hurt, to make it better as quick as he can. You know. 

00:39:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:39:50
PAT LOVE And then, of course, I can't just do that with her, once he, once that moment passes and a lot of times I just go silent and let that take it's place, or that magic moment, take it's place. 

00:40:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:40:05
PAT LOVE Uh, where everybody's quiet. Then when everything comes back, I say, then, one of the ways you can help right this minute, see if I got it right, I look at her, see if I got it right. 

00:40:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:40:20
PAT LOVE Is for you just to mirror this, validate this, empathize. All she's asking is be with me in my pain for this moment. You know, so I would, I teach it maybe before or after, sometimes I say, like, if I hadn't taught them that, I might, you know I wouldn't teach it while he's forclampt(ph). But I would, you know, use moment, then maybe help her to understand how I knew that and she didn't. 

00:40:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:40:50
PAT LOVE Uh, I don't know if that went off on a tangent, but... 

00:40:55
RICH SIMON No, no, no. 

00:40:55
PAT LOVE It just reminded me of that. Yeah. 

00:40:55
RICH SIMON So, so there, so there are these, these languages of, of love. These languages of how love is expressed and so you're part of, uh, the cultural fluency of the couples therapist. As you understanding both these languages and you become, uh, a, uh, an adept simultaneous translator. 

00:41:15
PAT LOVE Yeah. 

00:41:20
RICH SIMON And then bringing that and then creating an experience between the partners in the room. 

00:41:25
PAT LOVE Yeah. Uh, another example is flashing in my mind when you were talking earlier, and this was a hetero-sexual couple, and this could easily be a gay couple, and I think I had a gay couple very similar to this, but a hetero-sexual couple and she had in her head this, this testosterone dominant typical male and because he wasn't fitting in that category, she was unhappy. And, um, and, and some, a lot of her complaints and so what I said to her, was I said, "my hunch is part of what attracted you to this guy, was that he's a nice guy, that he's a good man. This is not the guy like your ex and the boyfriend before that, who left you and actually left you for your best friend and the first one for your sister-in-law". That's not the guy. You're saying you don't want that any more. This is what comes with it. The nice guy comes with a brain that gets turned on sexually once you're intimate. Once the criticism is replaced with asking for what you want. You know, once you really see him as a man who loves you, and not as a man who, you know, wants to with hold from you. And my hunch is, cause I could tell just by her demenor, my hunch is you're sort of a high- T, high testosterone gutsy woman. My hunch is you go fearlessly into places other people haven't been. My hunch is, you'll feel more comfortable with anger. You know, I make some of these assumptions... 

00:43:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:43:15
PAT LOVE That, and again, this is science. This is just research, this is just the hand of hormones, the neuro-hormones that we've felt. And, and, and so I not only use it along gender lines, sometimes it's in, in, in direct the opposite of what we would expect for a typical man or a typical woman. 

00:43:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:43:35
PAT LOVE So, I sort of, that's why I like to think of it as a continuum... 

00:43:40
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:43:40
PAT LOVE ...and not, you know, not descreet. I think this is where John Grey(ph) got in a little trouble. I think sexually in a professional meeting when they booed him on stage. This was years ago. And I think it was because he was talking about all men and all woman, all women. 

00:43:55
RICH SIMON Absolutes. 

00:44:00
PAT LOVE And, and we can't put it in absolutes, yup. 

00:44:00
RICH SIMON Yea. So, the, so men as therapists we know, so we have a field that is large, largely female, I mean someone was telling me, I mean it was maybe it's getting worse, but somebody was saying social workers, only 10% of social workers below the age of 35 are male. 

00:44:20
PAT LOVE Yeah, yeah. 

00:44:20
RICH SIMON So, um, when you are working with your supervisees or women, uh, in contrast to your supervisees as men, is it, do you do different things in terms of helping them develop their craft, in doing the kind of thing that you've been, uh, demonstrating to us so vividly in this conversation? 

00:44:45
PAT LOVE It's interesting because it's been my experience I haven't seen the result, uh, the research that validates this, but many men drawn to this profession, in my observation, are more estrogen dominant men. That they are sensitive, they are more comforting. 

00:45:05
RICH SIMON Let me put it this way, I'm, I'm, I'm extremely estrogen dominated here. 

00:45:10
PAT LOVE Yeah. Yes, yes. And, we, they tend to be drawn, that's been my observation, to to this profession and so they, uh, so I, so genderly speaking, the answer is there usually isn't much difference. 

00:45:25
RICH SIMON oh, okay. 

00:45:25
PAT LOVE That's not the sample that comes in, in my, you know. Um, they're, where it is a big difference though, is, is when they're, if I'm seeing a hetero-sexual couple, there are two women and a man in the room. You know? If a man is seeing a hetero-sexual couple, there are two men and a woman. I'm always sensitive to that. I'm always sensitive... 

00:45:50
RICH SIMON So, if that's there, then what is it? So if you're pointing that out to a supervisee, what does that dynamic set up and what does it that the therapist needs to be particularly aware of in that kind of gender... 

00:46:00
PAT LOVE Yeah, yeah. Especially if the female calls, um, for the session, and that's not always the case like I said earlier, but lets say she calls it's a hetero-sexual couple, I feel, I like I can push on her, confront her, a little more because I have, I have more credibility and more female, you know, compassion from her. Um, it's interesting because, when Steven gets up and talks about women, he gets so much more push-back than I do from women. And, and, uh, so he can't even say the same things in a lecture that I can say, for women, you know. 

00:46:45
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:46:50
PAT LOVE And, um, so, and I feel like I can, I use that leverage because ultimately I say to her it doesn't help us get what we say we want. You know, we've got to make it, we've got to be open to getting the love we say we want. 

00:47:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:47:05
PAT LOVE We've got to, you know, be, be, be aware that how vulnerable he is when we're unhappy. And, and, um, and when he can't, you know, give us what we say we want. 

00:47:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:47:20
PAT LOVE So, so, I think that and just looking at the differences in the vulnerability, I think is a big one. Just, I know, if she starts criticizing, I figured this out intuitively, a long ago not to let couples argue and criticize and bad mouth each other. First of all, it made me uncomfortable, and I just, the way I often stop that one or two ways, I just say do ya'll do this at home? 

00:47:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:47:55
PAT LOVE Well, yeah. Well, why would you be paying me to do this? You know, remember, I've been doing this 30 years, I say now, I'm a consultant, not a therapist, I'm much more directive. This is why I love the evidence based approach. Because I can say, ya'll can do that, but let me tell you what research says is gonna happen if you do it. So, I'm just more comfortable with that stuff, but the other thing I might say if, they start, if she, or he, but, but often it's the female who starts complaining, I would say, and here's a good line, and I say, and I lower my voice, you know, to get attention, I say, cause he, I believe he wants to give you what you say you want. So here, what's one small thing, in this moment, he could do to be helpful? "Well, I don't..." And then I'm like a dog with a bone. No I will get you to look at him, cause look. Look, here's a man wanting to help. What's one small thing in this moment he could do to be helpful? 

00:49:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:49:00
PAT LOVE And then, if she says, "well he could..." What's another small thing he could do. And then, so I might teach her that, but the other, you could flip it over and I would say, now does she, if she's gone, I might say to him, "now is this the type of conversations ya'll have at home?" And he might say, " Yeah, yeah." And I'll say, "Okay, here, I'm gonna give you a strategy, I'm gonna get you to look at her because see, I know gazing increases oxytocin in females, estrogen dominant females, testosterone actually offsets the effects of it, so, so, "I'm gonna get her to look in her soft eyes, and I'm gonna say this, no matter what she's saying, you say to her, 'honey, how can I help?'." And if she goes like this, you just go how can I help? Just get softer, softer eyes, "how can I help?" 

00:50:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:50:00
PAT LOVE One small thing right this minute, that I could do to be helpful. I want to help. You know I just make it like a broken record. Because remember when we, when there's an over-reaction, you know, when you feel like there's a bad reaction in therapy, you're usually tapped in and prefrontal cortex is getting a break, you know, the limbic system feels like I'm gonna die, and so what calms that, I'm assuming, what helps her fear, is for you to show up, engage, make contact, what's one small thing? Look in her eyes, soften your voice, begin, what's one small thing I can do in this moment that would be helpful? 

00:50:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:50:40
PAT LOVE What's another thing? You know, so the, so I'm always thinking this, um, in my mind when I'm directing, cause it's what do you want? How are you stopping yourself from getting it, and I try to give you what you say you want so a: you'll know it exists and b: then, I'm gonna show you how you got what you said you wanted, so you can take it home and use it. 

00:51:05
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. That's great, so, so, and, so, so immediate, so, as we're doing this I can almost see it as the session is happening right in our conversation with each other. So where do you, is given all this you, like the rest of us, occasionally, probably less frequently than many therapists, you hit the wall. You're some how all of this lovely stuff and understanding the science gender differences and brain science and all this enormous craft you've developed over 30 years of working with. Where do you, where's the, where's that wall for you? 

00:51:45
PAT LOVE Yeah. 

00:51:50
RICH SIMON When that happens, what does it look like? 

00:51:50
PAT LOVE Yeah, yeah, a couple just came to mind. 

00:51:55
RICH SIMON Really? 

00:51:55
PAT LOVE Yeah, a couple just came to mind, by the way, I hit the wall, trust me. Um, and, and, and sometimes it means I refer, you know, I have great referral sources. 

00:52:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:52:05
PAT LOVE Um, but I'm just thinking of a particular couple, and this is where research helps also. And, and I don't, uh, ascribe, you know via simcodes. I don't do insurance and that's not been my orientation and while I think it helps. I am familiar because i read the literature, and I would say, if I had to say, if you look at the descriptors of narcissism, you know, she falls into that category and I know what research says about narcissism and that is that it often doesn't change. They rarely come to therapy on their own, unless their partner forces them, or they've, they're unhappy with their partner, or they get lonely. Cause you wear people out. And so, this particular couple, to soften and to get some of those techniques to happen, it's almost like nobody's home. Nobody's home. So I have to, cause, cause in many ways I like to show, and have you experience what you say you want. 

00:53:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:53:10
PAT LOVE But the truth is, what want is unconditional adoration and nothing in return. You know, and, and, sometimes I separate the two and I talk to them individually, more candidly, I let her do her complaining without him, because that is not helpful in the session. I'm one of the people who is comfortable with seeing people individually, if they have the same contract. Now, if her contract I had this happen recently, a couple contacted me for therapy and at first, it sounded like she was ambivolent about, should I leave this therap-, this relationship or not... 

00:53:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:53:50
PAT LOVE ...and, but the wanted to see me individually well, to me that's a conflict of interest. Once I determine that her first choice was to be in the relationship, then I knew I could see the both of them and then as a couple. But I would not see them if she was ambivolent and was trying to decide whether to stay. Because you could just see how he might feel betrayed if I'm seeing them individually and she decides to leave. Does that make sense? 

00:54:20
RICH SIMON I see, yeah. It's complicated thing because we recently had a piece, uh, Bill Dorty(ph)he describes, that's his procedure is to determine early on what you called, uh, discernment. 

00:54:30
PAT LOVE Discernment, yes. Me too. I do that early on to try to get a sense of it because that depends on how, I would never... 

00:54:40
RICH SIMON With a different contract from what you, what you're... 

00:54:45
PAT LOVE My contract, yes. 

00:54:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:54:45
PAT LOVE Yes. And so, um, anyway, that, uh, that was just on the side, but I try to... 

00:54:50
RICH SIMON ...that kind of narcissistic, unruly... 

00:54:50
PAT LOVE Yes. So then I might separate them and do some psycho-education, and I know, because, from research what can make an impact is a good attuned relationship. And I might try to use my repoire with here, which is what I'm doing and it's actually working, actually better than anything, but I only I basically knew to do that from reading research about narcissism. And, and being more aprised about it. And then, I get very logical, and I, you know, I actually hand them lists that I e-mail back to them of what they say they want. And here's how you can get what you say you want. Here's, I took the notes. Here are the notes. I'm, I'm doing that more and more I find, I follow up with an e-mail and send them, because, you know... 

00:55:40
RICH SIMON Excuse me, doing what more and more? 

00:55:45
PAT LOVE Following up with an e-mail saying this is what I think went on in the session and this is what I think you... 

00:55:50
RICH SIMON Ahh, okay. 

00:55:50
PAT LOVE ...agreed to. Because, I, and many other people, are not auditory learners. 

00:55:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:55:55
PAT LOVE We don't always remember what we say, but if I see it in print, I'm much more likely to remember it, much more likely. And you know, therapy is sort of an altered state any way it's easy to forget... 

00:56:10
RICH SIMON Leave it in the sorting room. 

00:56:10
PAT LOVE Yeah. 

00:56:10
RICH SIMON Alright, so we just, we just have a few moments here and you've, you've laid out so much information. So if people are interested in following up on, um, these, these themes that you've developed for us, um, and doing more reading and doing more training, tell us about what, uh, are there resources on your website? How to, how to, how would people take the next step in developing along the lines you've laid out for us? 

00:56:40
PAT LOVE Yeah, for sure, yeah. The website's full of, you can get the books, you can get access to DVD's and CD's. The other thing I have on my website, people really like, is I have a download section, that's all these handouts that I love to create for therapists to use with their clients and they're free for you to use and whatever way you want to use them. 

00:57:05
RICH SIMON Really, oh wow! 

00:57:05
PAT LOVE Yeah. Yeah.

PAT LOVE Yeah. Pat Love dot com. www.patlove P-A-T L-O-V-E .com. Yeah, and my calendar's on there, my schedule, my trainings, where I'm going to be, uh, but basically I have information, will travel. You know, my tranings are mostly by almost all by invitation, and I just go where people invite me. 

00:57:30
RICH SIMON Alright. Um, so, um, uh, we're very glad we invited you here for conversation. Uh, I want to point out to, uh, to the audience out there, that, uh, we, as always, have a comment board. Again, let me remind you, the conversation that you've been listening to is the beginning of the conversation, we hope, not the end. So, please, take a moment now. Just write an e-mail to yourself and to the rest of us about what you learned, what connections you made listening to Pat. If you have some questions, go up on the comment board, uh, uh, Pat has agreed to, uh, she will, she will not write an encyclopedia in response to them, but she'll look at them and where appropriate, she may well respond. But for all of us, in terms of continuing the conversation, and your personal learning, strongly recommend that you, um, put a comment there up on the comment board. Pat, uh, what a pleasure. And...

PAT LOVE Oh, thank you.
