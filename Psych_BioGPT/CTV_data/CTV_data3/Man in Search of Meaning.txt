VIKTOR FRANKL Mr. Vice Chancelor, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your kind reception and as we are confronted with a psychiatrist who comes from Vienna, something that easily can be guessed because of my Viennese accent. You certainly expect me to start with a quotation or anything in context with Sigmund Freud. Well, it might be justified to speak of Freud right on the onset, at the onset of this presentation merely view of the fact that I certainly belong to the few people, it's no merit, it's just the effect, the side effect of my age, to the few people who have met Freud personally and this was the case in 1924, when I was a medical student but even prior to this time, when I was a high school student, I was, throughout several years, in correspondence with Sigmund Freud, exchanging letters with him but they fell prior to the robbery by the Gestapo. Well, it was in 1924 that I met him personally and when I introduced myself to him, by saying my name is Viktor Frankl he stopped me and said Viktor Frankl, (inaudible ) Street, number six, apartment number 25, second district of Vienna and I had left, it was left to me to say absolutely correct. He had a marvelous memory as you might have, uh, read in, uh, biographies on, on him as a person. Now in 1924, he published my first paper in his International Journal of Psychoanalysis but one year later, another paper of mine was published, another article in the International Journal of Individual Psychology, which was the creation, as you know, of Alfred Addler (ph). Now you see, psychoanalysis and individual psychology, Freudian versus Addlerian (ph) psychology were, in many respects, opposed to one another. Their views, not only with respect to psychotherapy or psychology but mainly in regard to their anthropology, to their concept of man, to the image of the human being they were depicting and such an anthropological basis is underlying each and every psychotherapeutic school or matter. With respect to this image of man, they were not only opposed to each other but strictly contradicting one another. Now this is not anything strange or exceptional because wherever, as it were, wherever you open the book of reality, say this is the book of reality. Wherever you open it, you find pictures of reality. The reality depicted in different and sometimes in contrast, strictly contradicting ways. Let me symbolize these contradictions by saying at the left side, you see a square. At the right side, you see a circle. Strict contradictions and you cannot, as you know from mathematics, the age old problem of squaring the circle has proved to be unsolvable. So there's no breaching possible between these contradictions but what about the following? Here, you have the two pages and the two contradicting pictures of reality. What about now if you put the left side into a position perpendicular to the other one? In other words, you then have the next higher dimension, the square and here the circle. And now, by way of what Cal Brueller (ph) in psychology told, uh, um, called the aha experience. You suddenly might become aware of the fact that you, without any, uh, without hesitating, may perceive these two pictures of reality contradicting one another as the projection of a cylinder. It's side view or profile becomes a square while its ground plan becomes a circle. In other words, by entering the next higher dimension, the three dimensional space versus the two dimensional planes, you become aware that the contradictions do not contradict. The oneness of that reality which has been depicted. Now the same holds for man. The same holds for the human reality. The same holds for the contradicting views that say Freud and Adler developed with regard to man. The contradictions need not contradict neither the unity of humanity, the oneness of the human being nor need they contradict his or her humanness. To be sure, provided that you venture to enter, to follow man into his human dimension, into the dimension in which this specifically, uh, human properties or phenomena are located. And this is exactly the assignment of psychotherapy because, as I hope I can evidence later on, psychotherapy has followed also the mentally suffering individual human being into the very human dimension because only this dimension is it possible to understand the plight and predicament of todays, uh, uh, society. And even more, only if you enter the next higher, that is the human dimension where the specifically human phenomena, as I said before, are located, you become capable of getting hold of, you become capable of drawing, of tapping those resources which are located and are available only within specific human dimension, a dimension beyond the power drive, a dimension beyond the sexual or aggressive and/or aggressive instinct, the other schools are dwelling on, are focusing on, are centered on. So I hope by help of, uh, this, these analogies I could make understand the point I wanted to make, that is that we have to follow man into this, his properly human dimension. And what are those, uh, uh, resources we can make avail of, which are those resources that we need to incorporate them into our therapeutic (inaudible ). They are mainly, as I see it, mainly two such resources. Two such specific properties of the human reality. First, what I've come to call the human, uh, faculty, the human ability, capacity to be, to offer, of self detachment. A human being is capable to detach him or herself from the world but more than that, also from himself or from herself. And this is something that, in that school that has been called, termed logotherapy , is mobilized and utilized in the setting of that, uh, logotherapeutic technique which is called paradoxical intention. In paradoxical intention, you are, uh, having the patient detach himself from his neurosis, from his compulsions and obsessions and phobias and so forth. To understand what's going on in this technique which is, uh, on an international level today, uh, astonishingly enough, uh, uh, practice, practice, being practiced world, in a worldwide scale, mainly by so called, uh, behavior therapists. To understand how, at least how I personally see the, uh, efficiency of this technique, we have to consider a phenomenon which is, has been called in psychiatry, well, a well known phenomenon, has been called anticipatory anxiety. You see, there might be a symptom, any symptom, which evokes, uh, anticipatory anxiety. This doesn't, this context does not mean Alcoholics Anonymous but, uh, anticipatory anxiety is being evoked. That is to say in plain words, a patient who notices, whom you have told that he's blushing when he enters a group of other people or starts stuttering at the moment he's confronted with an audience or starts sweating in his hands if he has to reach out his hand to some superior, uh, entity or a colleague or, or a boss. Such people who are afraid of any such symptom start being afraid of its recurrence and anticipatory anxiety provokes them exactly what it has been afraid of. So a symptom evokes anticipatory anxiety. Anticipatory anxiety in turn provokes the symptom to reappear. Could I make myself understood? And this again turns anticipatory anxiety into a full fledged phobia. This is the origin of most of those cases which are termed phobic or anxiety neurosis. Now what is the reaction on the part of the respective patient in such cases? He embarks on something I've termed flight from fear. He tries to evade all those situations that usually are, uh, uh, usually are arousing this specific fear of the patient. And if this symptom the patient is afraid of happens to be fear itself, that is to say an anxiety attack, he tries to evade all those situations that usually illicit this anxiety attack. This is the pattern, the reaction pattern, of agoraphobics, people who are afraid they may faint or collapse or get a stroke or a coronary on the streets in open places without being accompanied by anyone and, uh, helped by anyone. These people evade leaving their home. They are flying, they are embarking on a flight from fear. This is the first reaction but there are also other types of neurotic people who notice that strange ideas, not to say obsessive thoughts or compulsive, uh, ideas are cropping up within themselves and they now react in different way. They react in that form that once they are under the pressure of such strange ideas, such as compulsions or obsessions. Their reaction is that they exert some sort of counter pressure but counter pressure unfortunately increases the original pressure. Now pressure, they are under the pressure of obsessive ideas. Pressure induces counter pressure and counter pressure in turn increases the primary pressure. So we have again a circle formation, a vicious cycle as it were as the pathogenic mechanism between "causing a certain neurotic reaction type." In this case, not the agoraphobic pattern but the obsessive compulsive pattern. And now the problem is, uh, first of all, why do people, uh, exert such a counter pressure? What, what is the underlying reason or motivation because they think. They, the ideas of the obsessions might force them into homicidal acts, into suicidal acts or (inaudible ), more often than not that these strange ideas haunting and bothering them might be the precursors of mental illness, of psychosis and so forth. That the reason why they fight them and try to suppress them and thus this is what starts and, uh, induces these circular formations. Now, if it comes from the question how to unhinge these circle formations in therapeutic terms, you will understand since anticipatory anxiety, be it of a stroke or fainting on the street, be it of becoming psychotic or, or committing suicide and so forth, that such, uh, uh, from such an types of anticipatory anxiety you have simply to take out the wind, the wind of these anxieties and the simplest way to do that is that principle which, uh, as soon as in '29, I started to practice and, uh, then formulated in, uh, more systematic ways to encourage and invite the patient, even if only with cheek in, with tongue in cheek to wish to do or wish to happen, to do or wish to happen precisely those things that the patient had been afraid all along. I said I was emphasizing with tongue in cheek because all these attempts have to be set, settled. Uh, have to be, uh, uh, embodied in as humorous way of formulation as possible and in fact, a sense of humor is one of the specifically human properties. No animal is capable of laughing in the proper sense of the word. So humor comes in. Some thing, as we now understand, that is beyond the plain of drives and instincts and psychosomatics in one hand. On the other hand, of inferiority, feelings and so forth. But there is something that you have to draw from the intrinsically human dimension. Now humor turns out that way, in this view, this frame of reference, to be a very important coping mechanism and I dare say that it has been built in the very, uh, basic structure of the human reality. Let me quote from an article that was published a couple of years ago in the British Journal of Psychiatry, uh, Eva Hand (ph) and, uh, another order who had treated chronic agoraphobia patients in groups. They sent the groups of patients, of severely agoraphobic patients with a strong, with a usually panicking when confronted with open places and, uh, spaces and so forth. They sent them in the company of some young psychology students who did not intervene but just made the, uh, uh, some notes and were watching the patients, the group of patients. They sent them out to Picadilly Circus. Imagine it. Agoraphobics. And you know what happened? Let me quote from, literal from the paper. They spontaneously used humor, the patients themselves as an impressive, impressive coping device. "When the whole group was frightened, somebody would break the ice with a joke, which would be greeted with the laughter of relief by the others." They re-invented, the patients re-invented paradoxical intention, one may say. So you see, this is a mechanism built in the human substance as it were and mobilized particularly by this logotherapeutic technique called paradoxical intention. (inaudible ), a psychiatrist of McGill University, Montreal in Canada, treated an erythrophobic individual who had been suffering, handicapped better to say, by this condition for 12 years. Within four sessions, it's incredible. Within four sessions, and he published this paper in an outstanding, uh, uh, scientific journal on experimental, uh, uh, experimental behavior therapy. My former assistant at the Polytechnic Neurological Department treated a lady with a severe, compulsive condition, uh, a washing compulsion. A lady of 65 years of age whose, uh, compulsive, uh, neurosis had a duration of 60, 6-0, years. Within a couple of weeks, to that effect that this lady could resume her work after several decades of stopping it. Now it might be, uh, you might have the objection on your lips that yes, this is an anecdotal, uh, report on some single cases. You are right but there are also publications available, hundreds of publications among from which I just, uh, uh, uh, select one by, uh, Professor Gaul (ph). He's running a psychiatric hospital in east Germany. That is to say in a communist state, country, uh, and communism up to the last few years, throughout the decades, has always been in strict opposition to logotherapy. They called it, they dismissed it as just idealism, idealism and even, uh, uh, we are suspicious that we are smuggling in religion, heaven beware religion, and so they were strictly against logo therapy. But throughout the latest years, they have found that it is, uh, um, they can practice it with, uh, success and now, uh, this communist psychiatrist was publishing in the Californian based, uh, International Forum for Logotherapy an article from which I will like to confront you with, just one sentence. Uh, logotherapy methods have been a decisive factor in psychotherapeutic treatment of our department for 13 years. Their great advantage lies in the relatively short time needed to see positive results. Usually after as few as three to five sessions. So he ventures to publish this, uh, on the grounds of experience of 13 years and, uh, I would not generalize such a report but again and again, we observe the short term treatment of obsessive compulsive and phobic conditions can be controlled by this logotherapeutic technique called paradoxical intention. In the meantime, outstanding experimentally oriented psychiatrist such as Mike Asher (ph), who has now become the, in Philadelphia at the university, the follower on the chair of Joseph (inaudible ) who was starting, I know in your country, starting the whole business of, of, uh, uh, behavior therapy. Now the follower of no less is a scholar than, uh, uh, was Joseph Walpie (ph), Mike Asher, is turning out about in average two experimental articles per year and, uh, controlled experiments in addition to, uh, the work of, uh, Sollium (ph) and, uh, three of his collaborators, uh, on, uh, experimentation with paradoxical intention in obsessive compulsive neurosis at the, uh, McGill, uh, University in Montreal. Now we started with the year '24 and '25. It seemed that I was a, what you would call a fast breeder, uh, turning out a paper with psychoanalysis in the one year and the next year with (inaudible ) psychology but what about the next year, '26? It was the year in which I coined the term logotherapy already and in the states, United States, textbooks of psychology, you'll find the differentiation of the so-called (inaudible ), uh, Viennese school, Viennese schools of psychotherapy. It's not me, who is, uh, um, coined these terms but other orders and then they say, of course, over subdue to, for the sake of the, uh, for the (inaudible ) reasons oversimplifying. Many of them say, uh, psychoanalysis by Freud is centering on the will to pleasure, what they call, what the analysts call the pleasure principle and the Adlerians are centering, focusing on the will to power, striving for superiority as it was termed by Alfred Addler himself. Well, and the logotherapists, they are, uh, stressing and emphasizing man's will to meaning, his, uh, uh, attempt to see, to find the meaning, not only life in general but even in each single life situation confronting him and to try his best to fulfill and actualize this meaning. Okay, let's forget for a while, uh, these oversimplifications but let me just, uh, uh, emphasize that the meaning, basic meaning orientation of a human being as we see it and view it, is no more than one aspect of a more total phenomenon which I, uh, have trumped human self transcendence which means that human existence is characterized, basically characterized, by the fact that being human is always related to or pointing to something other than itself. Something other than itself or someone other than one's self. Something other than itself is a meaning to fulfill. Someone other than one's self is another human being lovingly to encounter. So the human reality really comes to the fore only at that moment that we are immersed in serving a cause higher than ourselves and/or loving a person other than ourselves. This is the intrinsic characteristic, contisuative (ph) characteristic of being human. In strict contrast to all the current, those current motivation theories that claim that a human being is the, the, uh, um, the, uh, psychic, uh, system is mainly concerned with, uh, maintaining the equilibrium within itself or restoring it if need be with satisfying drives and instincts. In other words, with the pleasure principle, behind which there is a more general principle in motivational theoretical terms, namely the homeostasis principle. That is to say that the system called human psyche is nothing more than something that is out to lower, keep very low, as low as possible, the amount, the level of tensions, inner tensions, be they aroused by the outer world or by, uh, uh, by societal commands or by the id fighting the ego, the ego fighting back the id, and simultaneously, uh, compromising with the, with the super ego and so forth. You notice this picture of the human psyche is just a, it depicts man as if he were something that thinks, that is concerned only with itself. Restoring the, the, the equilibrium and so forth but really, man is out to do something in the world, to reach out for the world, reaching out for, for, uh meanings to fulfill and other beings to, to love and so forth but never concerned merely with itself or something within itself. Now this is the reality of the human being. Now what about the other, the second school opposed so much to psychoanalysis? What about the Addlerian (ph) psychology? I myself have, for many years, until '27, when I was driven out upon the personal insistence by Alfred Adler because I was too little orthodox, I was expelled from this, uh, from the Addlerian society. Anyway, I owe it a lot and I've always, uh, stand for it, that I was for, uh, two years, a, a student of Alfred Adler but if you, upon a closer scrutiny, you also notice what is it I could, uh, provide you with a, uh, furnish you, furnish, uh, material (inaudible ) from Adler, uh, from Alfred Adler. Man basically is out to overcome the original and natural, natural inferiority feelings of the baby, of the little child and so forth. And in order to do so, he overcome them by this striving for superiority, for power. In other words, man is not reaching out into the world in the Adlerian picture of man, neither, but just concerned with how can I overcome my inferiority complex and, and so forth. It's still a motivation which restricts itself merely to the intrapsychic conditions. Over against the world to be, to, to, act into. This is the main difference, this monodilogistic (ph) picture of man underlying the, uh, uh, old, uh, schools of psychotherapy, in spite of all the merits they have, uh, earned in promoting, uh, uh, mental illness. So let's come for a moment back to the pleasure principle. You may as well identify pleasure, or substitute for pleasure, happiness and then it comes to mind the phrase, the, uh, uh, from the American Constitution, the phrase pursuit of happiness but, you see, as we see in logotherapy, the pursuit of happiness is necessarily the, necessarily something entirely self defeating. It turns out to be self defeating and you know why? Because happiness simply cannot be pursued and it cannot be pursued because it must ensue. Happiness must happen, I could say as well, and you have to let it happen. Let it happen by letting, uh, um, it remain a side effect. Be the side effect of fulfilling a meaning or the side effect of, uh, loving another person. But at the moment, and to the, to the extent to which you try to set out on a direct intention of happiness or for the better of, uh, sexual pleasure, you are unavoidably doomed to failure and you see this failing, uh, on the grounds of an attempt to direct intention and of directly obtaining it by aiming at it, by making pleasure a target, you see this happen in your office as a psychiatrist day by day, uh, office hour by office hour in sexual neurotic cases. Male patients, uh, failing in their sexual potency precisely because they are intending to show off to demonstrate their sexual potency. Female patients equally failing in obtaining sexual or full sexual orgasm because they are watching themselves and observing themselves and directly trying to attempt this peak, sexual peak experience rather than paying attention to all those sexual stimuli that might come, uh, in, uh, that might irradiate from, from their partner. This is impossible and now it turns out, what I've recently come to formulate in a short sentence, the theory so-called pleasure principle is in fact a fun spoiler because the more you reach out for sexual pleasure, the more you are failing and you may have arrived at the third of those, uh, reaction patterns which cause neurosis, according to the view, logotherapeutic view, namely the sexually neurotic pattern. The sexual neurotic individual is, by way of what we call hyper-intention, forcibly striving, intentionally striving, directly striving, for sexual pleasure. By hyper-intention of sexual pleasure, he is failing because this is accompanied, this evokes in turn what we call hyper-reflection. They're not only trying to get that orgasm, but also they are watching themselves, observing themselves. Do I have an orgasm? What if I do not and how long will it take me and so forth? You simply deter concentrate you attention on yourself, on something within yourself rather than surrendering to the partner. Now you may understand. This is the third circle formation. The third vicious cycle. And now you may understand that therapy, specifically of course, logotherapy is out to bring in to play what I would like to call centrifugal forces. That is, instead of striving for pleasure in a direct way, you have to give yourself to the partner and giving yourself is only possible by forgetting yourself. That is to say, instead of hyper-reflecting yourself, you have, by way of another, second, uh, centrifugal force, you have to forget yourself. Giving yourself to the partner and thereby forgetting yourself relieves you and opens up, is breaking up this vicious cycle which illicits, uh, which consists in hyper-intention of sexual pleasure, causing hyper-reflection of your potency and/or orgasm and perpetuating the, the neurotic, uh, cycle and, uh, uh, and, uh, condition. So you see that self transcendence is nothing at all, in no way anything dwelling in an ivory tower, suspended in the air but completely down to earth, down into the biological foundations of the human being. Down to, to, to, uh, uh, say bed stories and so forth. Down to these trivialities. Self transcendence is what is essential and, uh, constitutive for being and remaining. Being and remaining a fully functioning human being. Let me conclude this, uh, problem of self transcendence by invoking an analogy which, as I've heard again and again, alleviates and makes it easier, uh, to my audience to understand what I basically, uh, what I am basic, um, basically out to, uh, to convey to you. I would say the eye has a self transcendent quality. What do I mean by that? You see, ironically enough, the capacity of the eye to carry out its function, namely to perceive optically the surrounding world, is absolutely contingent on its incapacity to perceive itself. If you forget about, uh, using a mirror, you will agree and admit that if the eye ever perceives anything of itself, anything going on within itself, to the very same extent, its seeing capacity has been impaired. For instance, if I see some clouds it might be a cataract within the lens of my eye. If I'm seeing, uh, rainbow halos around a light, it might be a signal of the heightened tension in a certain part of the eyeball because I am suffering from a glaucoma. So you see, once that the eye perceives something of itself, going on within itself, some , it is a pathologic process simultaneously impairing its seeing capacity, its ability properly to function and it's the same with man. Man becomes fully human to the very extent to which rather than being concerned with anything within himself, is forgetting himself as I said before or overlooking himself as I said with respect to the normal functioning eye. Overlooking and forgetting one's self is the basis, the pre-condition to be or become really human and to actualize thereby to actualize one's self. So you see that the business of so-called self actualization should not be misunderstood. You cannot chase, you cannot, for, you cannot hunt self actualization. Abraham Maslow, who was the first, uh, to come up systematically with this problem of self, uh, self actualization said, and even more, in the last years of his writing, he explicitly stated that my criticism of his self actualizing theory was right and justified and he verbally stated Frankl's right in so far as self actualization can best be obtained by following selfless goals, by devoting one's self to other things rather than to being concerned with self actualization. So you see, it's elusive. Self actualization must remain in the same way as happiness must remain a side effect by, of not caring for it but rather forgetting about it by selfless goals, by devotion to selfless goals as Abraham Maslow said or by embarking on self transcendence rather than self actualization. Uh, usually, particularly the American orders in the field, speak of, uh, actualizing one's potentials. It sounds very nice but self actualization in the sense of actualizing one's own potentials reminds me of a certain case. Namely the case of Socrates. Socrates once confessed that he had within himself the potential to become a criminal. So, among other potentials, there was this potential, this specific potential but he decided rather than to become a criminal and actualizing this, uh, potential, he wanted to become the great philosopher. He wanted to serve other people. He felt that it was more meaningful to actualize his philosophical potentials rather than to actualize his criminal potentials. In other words, he had made a choice and he had found that more meaning lies in the one choice than in the, as compared with the other. So the problem of values, the problem of meanings is just postponed if you set out to declare self actualization is the supreme goal of human existence. You have to make a choice. You have to found out, find out what is most meaningful and what is not and self actualization in itself per se is just a slogan but the problem starts, begins, with stating self actualization, setting it up as a goal. But let's ask the question who are the people who are so much out to actualize themselves. You know what I found out when I found it out, where I found it out myself? When at, uh, the University of, uh, Melbourne, decades ago, I, after a lecture, I was offered the souvenir, an Australian boomerang. And when it came to mind, this is the very symbol of human self transcendence. You know why? Because we Europeans are not aware of but the Australians told me it is no way the boomerang unconditional, uh, function of a boomerang to return to the hunter. No, only that boomerang returns to the hunter, that boomerang which in the first place has missed the prey. Isn't that the same with human beings? Only those personality types who in the first place have missed their mission, have not found even, uh, less fulfilled a meaning in their lives. Only these existentially frustrated types of personality are so much out to actualize at least themselves and reflecting upon themselves and are so much and, uh, so much speaking of self actualization rather than forgetting themselves by giving of themselves to a cause or a trust but let us now ask another question. Self transcendence presupposes as I said just before, overlooking one's self and forgetting one's self. But how can the self transcendence itself, this phenomenon, this basic phenomenon has for so long a time apparently been forgotten, overlooked by psychologists. What about this question? I have tried to make this understandable to you, the way how I see the following. What psychologists necessarily have to do is observing and explaining human behavior. This is the observing eye of psychology but if I may freely, uh, uh, restate, reformulate the well known Heisenberg (ph) principle, I could say observation unavoidably influences the object of observation and the same holds in a way for psychology. The eye observing a human subject necessarily and unavoidably turns it into an object but, alas, it is, it's again the venture, the venture of a (inaudible ), uh, uh, and a contention I cannot, uh, uh, argue at the moment, uh, about. It is the intrinsic property of any subject, say a human being, the psyche, the spirit of whatever you, the mind, the human mind. It's the intrinsic property of a subject that it has objects of its own. That is to say what, since (inaudible ) has been called in philosophy intentional objects or, excuse me, intentional referents. Meanings in the world, other human beings in the world, causes to serve, to repeat this phrase, persons to love or all those things in the world, values to, uh, uh, actualize, to realize. All those things and beings in the world that constitute reasons to act, to act as human beings. Not just to behave, but to act and acting presupposes that you have a reason to act. For instance, a person who due to certain properties and qualities seem to you lovable, you have a reason to love him or her or you have a reason to, to, uh, to do something about something because you find it is meaningful. So meanings and other beings constitutes, constitute the reasons to act as human beings, which is intrinsically more than just behaving one way or the other. Now at the moment you shut out the whole world and treat the subject as an object, you cut off all the beings, meanings, potential meanings, all the reasons to act humanly at the moment you have only to your hands an object called psychological system and so forth. Now, to explain, I said you're observing a subject. You are explaining his behavior, you remember as I put it. Then, in order to, in order to explain the behavior, no longer acting, but the behavior of this object called the human person. In order to do so, you have to substitute for the reasons to act, what? The causes that cause the object to behave that way or another. Could I make this half way clear at least? And what are the causes, it depends. If you are behavioristically oriented, it will be, uh, conditioning processes or learning processes and so forth. If you're rather, uh, psychodynamically oriented, you have to, to substitute for reasons to act the, uh, drives and instincts that compel you or propel you to behave this way or another. There are causes rather than reasons but it makes a difference. You know how I am, and the easiest way can explain this difference, by drawing your attention to what happens if you are cutting onions. You start weeping. Your tears have a cause. The (inaudible ) oils in the onion but your tears have no reason, you have no reason to weep. If someone how we are loving dies, then you have a reason to cry but if you are cutting onions, you have just, there is just a cause that causes your tears to come up to your eyes. That's the difference. The one thing can be purely somatic, or organic or material. The other thing is the human mind reaching out into the world. Now you understand just be observing an individual's behavior, behavior does away with his, uh, intrinsically reaching out into the world, acting into a world replete of potential meanings to fulfill and persons potentially to love. Instead of acting into the world as a human being, what remains, what is left is just reacting to stimuli according to the concept of the behaviorist or unreacting. The tensions aroused by the conflicts between id, ego, and super ego or by upcoming drives and instincts and so forth. This is what then is left. Tensions due to conflicts and complexes to drives and instincts and the disturbance of the homeostasis of the in, of the inner equilibrium. So I hope I could, it is partially conveyed to you this lack of humanness that necessarily derives from a one sided, (inaudible ), impersonal, unexistential and inhuman picture of a human being. You see, the subtitle, uh, in my eyes it was the main title, the taught a humanization of psychotherapy is underlying whatever is up to now tried to convey to you and we, I stick to the subject although I must, uh, uh, uh, distract your attention to lots of analogies, uh, starting with geometry and so forth but I hope you, you make allowance for this. It is, uh, for your sake and not for my sake that I try, uh, to bring this in.

VIKTOR FRANKL You might have noticed that logotherapy is a meaning centered psychotherapy, one could say. It views the human being as a basically meaning oriented being but today we are caught, wide segments of our populations, in a feeling of meaninglessness which is accompanied by a feeling of inner emptiness, by that phenomenon I have come to term the existential vacuum. It manifests itself in two ways: boredom and apathy. Boredom we may define as lack of interest. Apathy as loss of initiative. Interest means interest taken in the world and initiative means taking the initiative to do something within the world, about the world, to change something within the world. Both are lacking and this state of affairs is increasing and spreading. Something that easily can be empirically evidenced. It is not only observable in the so-called Western world but also in the east in terms of, uh, in the sense of a communist, uh, states and countries and even in the so-called third world. What might have caused it? Let me oversimply, deliberately oversimplify, uh, the answer. Uh, a biological and a sociological condition. Biological in as much as, uh, man in contrast to other animals, uh, is not, uh, towed by drives and instincts. What he must do and the sociological aspect of the phenomenon, uh, refers to the fact that in contrast to man in former times, he's no longer, uh, guided by traditions and traditional values that tell him what he should do. Now, neither knowing what he must do nor what he should do, he sometimes seems no longer to know what he, what he really wishes to do and you know what then happens? Either he simply does what other people are doing and this is responsible and accountable for the widespread conformist or he simply does what other people want him to do and this might way contribute to the totalitarianism in, uh, certain parts of the world. Now, uh, the, uh, loss of, the crumbling of traditions is of course, uh, mainly to be observed in the industrialized societies. Men are uprooted in cultural terms and, uh, the industrial society is out, basically out to satisfy, uh, all needs a human individual may have in the form of consumer society, our societies even out to create ever new needs so that it, uh, may afterwards try to satisfy them and so it comes that people in our societies have, uh, in general, in general, they have the means to live by but they miss a meaning to live for. This is the basic problem, as I see it and of course some have not even, uh, sufficient means to live by. I particularly think of the worldwide problem of, uh, unemployment but I would like to, uh, take the time to analyze it but I could show you, uh, empirically that the real problem with unemployment for the individual afflicted with it lies in his sense of meaninglessness. People, unemployed people, tend toward telling themselves I'm jobless. This means that my life, that I'm useless and I'm useless implies that my life is meaningless, you see? This twofold erroneous identification is what lies at the bottom of, uh, the, uh, the depression in cases of unemployment. But let me specifically turn to the effects of the existential vacuum in youngsters, in young people. Uh, it turns out that in effect the main effects could be, uh, called the taxi syndrome. I have chosen the, uh, taxi syndrome. Uh, once I had to give a, upon invitation of the whole student of, uh, the University of Atlanta in Georgia, uh, in U.S. Uh, uh, I should give a lecture to them and they insisted I have to lecture under the title is the new generation mad? I had no other choice so I went to Atlanta, Georgia and, uh, then, uh, I, it was a thunderstorm. I had to take a taxi and the taxi driver, too, uh, asked me what do you do in that, uh, small, uh, city, the university city. Uh, and I said I have to give a lecture to the students. And what are you lecturing? Yes, they selected the title Is the New Generation Mad? Huh, he said. Don't laugh but, uh, uh I'll make you a suggestion. I take over your taxi and you take over my lecture. I could not do that. I said I just arrived from Vienna. You know more about your youngsters than I do. Now frankly, tell me. Is the new generation mad? You know what he said, like out of a pistol? He said of course they are. They kill each other, they kill themselves, and they take dope. He had pointed his finger to the mass neurotic syndrome. They kill each other, aggression. They kill themselves, depression. And they take dope, addiction. And it can be evidenced on strictly empirical grounds that underlying is a feeling of meaninglessness. In suicide, in slow suicide, addiction, and in homicide. But all this does not mean that the feeling of meaningless is anything pathological. It is a privilege of man, not only to quest for meaning to his life but even to question that such a meaning is available at all. No animal has ever raised the question whether its existence makes sense or not. So an animal, I said before, cannot laugh nor can an animal doubt the meaning of its existence. It is a privilege of man and it is particularly, in particular, a prerogative of youth not to take meaning out from the hands of traditions but boldly to set out to find a meaning, a specific meaning to their own lives independently and by themselves. Now you will understand that this might have an impact on the present problems of education and let me, in this context commemorate the late Professor Oberholzer (ph) who has throughout decades devoted himself, dedicated himself to the problem in which sense and to which extent logotherapy may have, uh, to offer a potential contribution in the field of education and he was the first to promote the awareness of the academic, uh, public of academic status in South Africa regarding this potential contribution and he then was followed also, uh, by Professor Dryer (ph) as I know, uh, is a pioneer in the same field and attempt and in, and in addition to, uh, Dr., uh, Scolband (ph), uh, who has, uh, devoted his thesis, doctoral thesis, to the applicability of logotherapy to educational, uh, problems, other problems in your country. Uh, he has been, uh, mentioned yesterday in the, in the, uh, uh, (inaudible ). We have also to, uh, remind, be, remain aware that it was Dr. Patty (ph) having (inaudible ) who devoted her thesis to the issue of logotherapy many years ago and, uh, since that time, has, uh, continued to dedicate part of her work, uh, to the promotion of, uh, the cause of logotherapy and please do not forget that the mere, the very fact that today I am confronting and addressing you, uh, is to, uh, primarily goes to the credit of Patty and allow me to thank her in this context. Well, what I wanted...

VIKTOR FRANKL What I wanted to say in, uh, this, uh, uh, connection is, uh, that the fact that although the existential vacuum is per se nothing pathological. It may well become pathogenic. It may cause mental suffering. It may cause neurotic illness. It may cause what I've come to call the neurogenic neurosis, neurosis deriving from, uh, clashes of values, from value conflict, from conflicts of, uh, the (inaudible ) conscience and mainly from the existential vacuum feeling of meaninglessness. So far, we dispose of 10 logotherapeutic tests by which we may statistically and empirically measure the degree of existential frustration and independently from each other trump out by way of so far 10, uh, empirical studies that about 20% of neurotic cases have to be qualified as basically neurogenic in nature and in origin. Now this leads to the final chapter of my presentation, if you give me still a bit time to dwell on it. Namely, the therapeutic, uh, aspect of the problem. Uh, neurogenic neurosis deriving from existential or spiritual problems necessarily call for a logotherapeutic treatment. Now, you cannot give meanings. You can't. You have to find the, them. You have to find them by your, uh, uh, by your, uh, conscience, which is the meaning organ as it were, not a, a (inaudible ) organ but a (inaudible ). You cannot hand out prescriptions regarding what the meaning of a patient's life is or should be but what you may well, uh, do is, uh, describe, not prescribe a meaning but describe how the average man, the man on the street, goes about finding meaning and you have to keep in mind that in logotherapeutic views, meaning is something down to the earth, something that is, uh, located, uh, halfway between two well known psychological phenomena. The aha experience along the lines of Karl Buhler and the Gestault, Gestault, uh, perception of Max Wertheimer, who is the, uh, one of the founders of Gestault psychology. Incidentally, Gestault psychology has virtually nothing to do and in common with the Gestalt therapy by Frederick Perls and this is not my own contention but I was literally quoting the contention of Max Wertheimer's son a psychology professor in the United States Michael Wertheimer, virtually nothing in common. Now anyway, We, uh, have a chance to no less than 20 strictly empirical studies turned out on universities virtually on all continents demonstrating by tests and statistics that in principle, a human being is able to find meaning in life regardless of gender, regardless of age, regardless of the IQ, regardless of the, uh, character structure, regardless of the environment, and regardless of the educational background. In principle, all they are capable of finding meaning. This could be evidenced and most interestingly, it was also evidenced that people can find meaning irrespective of whether or not they were religious and if they were religious, irrespective of their denominational belonging and I would not venture to confront you with this empirical result, research result, unless particularly these results had been turned out by priests who owed their dissertation on the subject, uh, particularly in, uh, in, uh, uh, Canada. So I just have to confront you with these research results and how is this explainable, that each and every individual in each and every situation, under each and any condition can find, in principle, a meaning in life. How is this conceivable at all? Let me offer my answer. This is due to the fact that, as a phenonemological (ph) analysis of the pre-reflective ontological (ph) self understanding of man would reveal on the grounds of what the wisdom of our hearts has known all along, it would reveal that there are three main avenues leading up to meaning fulfillment in life. First, we can find meaning in our lives by doing a deed or creating a work. Second, by experiencing something, what is good, what is beautiful, what is true. Nature, culture, science, research, art and so forth. By experiencing something and last but not least, by lovingly encountering someone. In plain words, we can find the meaning through our works and through our loves but most importantly, turns out in the final analysis that even an individual that is confronted with a hopeless situation as its helpless victim, a hopeless situation, seeming (inaudible ) so to speak. Even such an individual can bear, find a meaning in his suffering situation, a meaning by bearing witness to the intrinsically human capacity to turn a tragedy into a personal triumph. To turn a predicament into a human achievement. These sound like just words but let me invoke two examples. The first is quoted from a book by a German bishop George Moser (ph) who wrote in a small booklet about the meaning of life, uh, around the following story. A few years World War II, a doctor examined a Jewish woman who wore a bracelet made of baby teeth and mounted in gold. "A beautiful bracelet," the doctor remarked. Yes, the woman answered. You see doctor, this tooth here belonged to Miriam, this one to Esther, and this one to Samuel. And she mentioned the names of her daughters and sons according to age. Nine children, she added and all of them were taken to the gas chambers. Shocked, the doctor asked how can you live with such a bracelet? Quietly, the Jewish woman replied, I'm now in charge of an orphanage in Israel. Now, if you cannot change a situation because it's simply unchangeable, in other words if you have to face fate, you still have an opportunity to change yourself by rising above yourself and by growing beyond yourself. Second example. I'm quoting from a newspaper, a Texan newspaper. Jerry Long has been paralyzed from his neck down since a diving accident when he was 17 years. He uses a mouth stick to type and he, uh, is occupying himself by reading, watching television, and writing. Well, this young man wrote a letter to me three years ago. Dear Dr. Frankl, I've read with much interest Man's Search For Meaning. And so it goes on. Then he says that I'm currently enrolled in my first psychology course in college. He's, he was capable to, uh, attend this lecture seminars, to take, give examinations, to do a special, uh, special television set then he says, you see I like people and want to help them by becoming a psychologist. Then he said, at the conclusion of his first letter, I broke my neck. It did not break me. And then in another letter, he says without suffering, the growth that I have achieved would have been impossible. Well, I met this young man. I invited him to give a lecture at the Third World Congress of Logotherapy at the University of Regensburg in West Germany. He was flown over in his wheelchair from Texas to West Germany. He has a beautiful face, head, and beyond, below that head, its just a skeleton, atrophied. You cannot imagine. His weight is, uh, 25 kilogram and something like this. And this vitality, spiritual vitality is, you wouldn't, it's unbelievable. So I met this man and since that time, again and again he writes a letter to me after a couple of months. The last letter, the last letter he boldly states I have been counseling already at several local hospitals with excellent results and then he modestly states accomplishments however are not to be rested upon but built upon. This is Jerry Long. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, I am now concluding what I wanted to, uh, demonstrate but there is a last, uh, question to be confronted and this is the question whether, if, if life has a meaning in spite of suffering. You must not misunderstand what I'm heading for, what I wish you to understand. Mainly, in no way do I wish to, uh, state that suffering itself is anything meaningful but what I want to say is solely that meaning is available even in the midst of suffering, in spite of suffering, not to say thanks to suffering. But provided that the suffering has been an unavoidable suffering, as long as you can remove, or as soon as you can remove what causes suffering, be it biological through surgery, be is psychological through psychiatry, be it sociological through political action. You have to try to remove what causes suffering and only if you can not do anything about the suffering situation, only then does it make sense to take it upon yourself, uh, as it were, as your, your, uh, cross. Most, uh, illustrative I have found to be a, an advertisement in an American newspaper, uh, which, uh, has been couched, uh, in a poem and the poem reads as follows: Calmly bear without ado that which fate imposed on you but to bedbugs don't resign. Turn for help to Rosenstein Extermination Company.

VIKTOR FRANKL You see, now that we speak in a different style, or ontologically (ph), the priority stays with acting, with changing one's fate, with changing something in the world. The priority but if need be, the superiority of meaning goes to that meaning which can be found out and which, which can be, uh, torn, squeezed out from an unchangeable situation of suffering in life and what about death? Doesn't death just take away any meaning potentiality of life? On the contrary. Death may not, gives meaning to life. Just imagine what would happen if we could, if we were, uh, immortal beings. We could postpone everything. You need not do anything or experience anything and enjoy anything right at the moment. You could postpone it. You could do it as well next week, next year, in 100 years. Solely on the grounds of the fact we are mortals, it makes, it does make sense to use each single opportunity to fulfill the meaning of the moment, of the specific situation confronting us as unique human individuals. In other words, we're to actualize the potentialities, meaning potentialities that's offered to us because they are transitory but it's only the potentialities that are transitory. What do I mean? What I mean is that once that you have turned them into an actuality, converted them into realities, fulfilled the meaning offered to you, at that moment, they have been eternalized, as it were. They have been safely, they've not only been actualized once, once that they have been actualized, I said, but once and forever. You have safely deposited and delivered them in the past, where nothing and nobody can rob you of what you have rescued into the past. In the past, everything is not irrecoverably lost but on the contrary irrevocably saved, stored and treasured. Usually, one only notices this stubbled field, stubbled field of human transitoriness, the transitoriness of our lives but we overlook and forget the full graineries into which we have, for long, brought in our, the, the harvest of our lives. That is the deeds done, the loves loved, and last but not least, the sufferings gone through with courage and dignity. This remains. Now you will understand that there is no need to pity old people. Why should you pity them because they no longer have, like a young individual, uh, possibilities in their future? No. You should rather envy them because instead of possibilities in their future, they have already realities in their past in the sense in which I've tried to outline it before. They have the values actualized, the meanings fulfilled and, you see, I spoke before of the unconditional, unconditional potential meaningfulness of human existence and this is paralleled by the equally unconditional human dignity. The human dignity rests with the man, up to his last breath because it is not contingent on his or her present usefulness but rests on his or her past, on the, on the values actualized in the past. In, on the meanings fulfilled this has no longer anything to do with the present or loss usefulness of any individual. Usefulness for whom? For society. For what of society? An achievement oriented society which therefore is entirely adoring youth and contempting old age and such people who subscribe to this orientation owe it solely to their own inconsistency if they are going to plead in favor of euthanasia strictly along the lines of the euthanasia program of Adolph Hitler. In whose flame one was out, and set out and set out to do away with old age, with people with incurable diseases, with people in mental deterioration, or with other people who, due to whatever type of handicap, were to be just gassed in gas chambers. Ladies and gentlemen, there might be among you a few who have, uh, uh, read a book of mine and you'll certainly, if so, remember the case of an old practitioner who came to see me because he had lost his wife two years before and was caught in severe depression and could not overcome it and he knew I could help him but, uh, he could have made, uh, prescription himself but he just wanted for a while to talk with me and he told me his story and what should I do? I couldn't help him. I couldn't change his situation. I just asked him, in the course of one might call a Socratic dialog, I asked him a question. Tell me, doctor, what would have happened if not your wife but if you had died first. Oh, this would have been terrible to her he said. How much my wife would have suffered. It was just left to me to point out that you see, doctor, your wife has been spared that suffering and it's after all you yourself who have spared her this suffering, to be sure at the price that now you have to mourn her and to suffer. At that moment, there was a total reversal of his attitude. His fate could not be changed but he saw things in the light of a sacrifice to offer to his wife, whom he had loved above all. And please do not forget, despair, he who had been in despair, equals s minus m. Despair I would define as suffering with no meaning. At the moment, his suffering, his mourning, had been conferred upon a meaning, the meaning of a sacrifice. This change of attitude removes, remove his despair. Now why I am invoke this case? Because again and again I am confronted with books and articles in which, uh, all of us contend, uh, this is typical, logotherapeutic. This is the backdrop of, uh, Frankl. I've never in my life again told anyone such an approach or, or suggested such an approach. It was sheer improvisation. You, you have to improvise in psychotherapy and beyond that, you have to individualize in psychotherapy about, uh, uh, a bit along the lines of being the doctor who, many decades or hundreds of years ago came up with the concept, uh, concept of neurasthenia . You know what he said? If you treat two cases of neurathenia in the same manner, you have at least mistreated one of them, if not more. So much have you to individualize. But you neither have to dismiss disparagingly something that is usually called technique or strategy or intervention and so forth. Let me offer you an example. In '41, I was called in the morning, waked up by a telephone call and the partner was Gestapo. He is the Gestapo Headquarters. You come tomorrow to room number so-and-son. Should I take a toothbrush and a, a, uh, uh, something else with myself? Yes. This meant that I will be kept there and sent to a concentration camp. So I went there on the next morning and was confronted with the Gestapo agent and he involved me in a cross-examination but after an hour, he asked me what is your profession, what have you studied, what is, uh, psychotherapy, what is a neurosis, how would a psychotherapist read an anxiety neurosis, and agoraphobia, and what is an agoraphobia, and so on and he always referred to his friend who is suffering from a severe agoraphobia and throughout hours, I talked to him and he understood what I meant and I always told him you should tell your friend that in case that anxiety crops up, he should, uh, try to ridicule it, he should, uh, say to himself, "Okay, let's go out and, and, uh, have two strokes and three coronaries and so far," in a joking manner. I instruct him in paradoxical intention, sheer mere technique, impersonal and I knew that it was his own case but I always referred to his own friend. And you know, he did not pay me any fee, of course, in cash, but otherwise, it must have worked, this technique. Otherwise, I could not explain how came that my father and my mother and myself could still remain in Vienna for a whole year before, one year later, we were sent to Terezin and Auschwitz and Dachau and so forth. So technique too is working. But something else has to come in and now I am rounding the picture, the subject, the issue of humanizing psychotherapy. What must come in is the human touch, the human factor. Let me invoke, in conclusion, another example. I once was waked up, not at 7:00 in the morning, but at 3:00 in the morning by a lady who wanted to tell me over the telephone she's about to take her life and due to some curiosity, she would like to know what Dr. Frankl would say to this resolution. I talked for her, I know it exactly, for half an hour until I had her to the point that she gave me her word, instead of killing herself she would come to my, uh, uh, hospital on the next morning at 9:00 and we'll discuss it further on. And when she appeared, and she started telling me the following story. Dr., you would be mistaken, severely mistaken if you assume that your wonderful words, uh, speaking in favor of, uh, surviving rather than taking one's life had impressed me to the least. Nothing of, not at all. You see, the fact that I woke that guy Dr. Frankl up at 3:00 in the morning and instead of becoming, uh, angry with myself, he was talking to me. He was patiently listening to me for half an hour. This very fact motivated me to give life another chance and so that's why I came here. I had patiently listened to her half an hour. This was precisely the human factor. Now, ladies and gentlemen, you mention how much I must be impressed that you have not only been listening to me for half an hour but for one and a half hour. Thank you.
